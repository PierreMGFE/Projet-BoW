Executive Summary 

(9 

This i s the f i r s t Country Assistance Strategy to be prepared f o r Honduras since completion o f the 
country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in October 2001. The PRSP, wh ich was presented to the 
Board in FY02 , presents a coherent and credible - i f ambitious - strategy to reduce poverty in Honduras, and 
i s consistent w i th i t s poverty diagnosis wh ich takes in to account the h is tor ica l and structural roots o f the 
country’s high inequa l i ty and widespread poverty. The PRSP was developed fo l low ing a broad and deep 
consultation process w i t h stakeholders throughout Honduras. The current Honduran Government, wh ich took 
o f f ice shortly after the completion o f the PRSP, has con f irmed i t s comm i tmen t to the objectives and pr ior i t ies 
expressed in the PRSP, wh ich serves as the basis for this CAS . The C A S also takes in to account experience 
w i t h PRSP implementation to date, inc lud ing new issues that Government i s considering, as the country’s 
circumstances evolve. In i t s discussion o f this CAS, the Board may w ish to consider the fo l low ing issues: 

0 

0 Does the proposed strategy adequately address the ma in development needs articulated in the PRSP? D o 
Directors consider that the proposed strategy f i t s appropriately w i th in the overa l l programs o f mu l t i- la tera l and 
bi-lateral assistance to Honduras? 
I s the balance between investment and quick-disbursing lending appropriate? Shou ld a quicker sh i f t to 
programmatic quick-disbursing lend ing be contemplated, given that Honduras i s a PRSP country? 
0 Does the design o f the program and i t s triggers o f fer a su f f ic ien t ly f lex ib le yet care fu l response to country 
conditions and r i s k s ? 
0 D o Directors support the shift towards regional activities, bo th in selected lend ing activities and, 
especially, w i th respect to analytical wo rk and other knowledge services? 

11 

Government i s currently in the process o f developing i t s f i r s t PRSP Progress Report (PRSP-PR), 
wh ich has been delayed pending agreement on new macroeconomic parameters and structural targets that 
wou ld underpin a possible new PRGF arrangement w i t h the In terna t iona l Mone tary Fund (IMF). The 
previous arrangement had been o f f- track since the last year o f the prev ious administration, and the incom ing 
Maduro Government’s e f for ts to negotiate a new PRGF have been hampered by differences on f isca l po l icy as 
we l l as the d i f f icu l ty o f mov ing fo rwa rd on key structural reforms (especially passage o f a comprehensive 
c i v i l service law) in the face o f a d iv ided Congress and opposition f r om vested interests. Prospects fo r 
achievement o f a new PRGF arrangement have brightened in recent months. The Honduran Congress recently 
passed a substantial tax package wh ich w i l l help ameliorate the country’s f isca l situation, and negotiations 
w i th stakeholders are underway on c i v i l service re fo rm and a related wage bill. The expectation i s that an 
agreement on the PRGF wou ld be reached in the latter h a l f o f this calendar year - in turn, pav ing the way f o r 
achievement o f the HIPC comp le t ion po in t and related debt re l ie f . 

... 111 

The previous C A S fo r Honduras was developed i n the immediate aftermath o f Hurricane M i t c h 
(October 1998) , wh ich had a devastating impact on Honduras’ people and economy. As such, the CAS 
focused on reconstruction and on lay ing the basis fo r sustained pover ty reduc t ion and inc lus ive g row th in the 
medium and longer term, inter a l ia , through assisting in the development o f the PRSP, supporting a sound 
macro framework and focus ing on strengthening social services, the safety net , and ru ra l development. M o s t 
o f these pr ior i t ies were met, w i t h the notable exception o f the above-mentioned weaknesses in f isca l 
management, wh ich emerged in the run up to the 2001 elections and derailed the last PRGF arrangement. 
Through i t s basis i n the PRSP’s six pillars, this CAS builds on the accomplishments o f the previous one, but 
lays greater emphasis on addressing long-standing structural barriers to inc lus ive grow th ( inc lud ing trade 
enhancement, compe t i t ion po l icy , f inanc ia l sector reform, property rights, urban and rura l employment and 
governance improvements). 
I t also continues to support human development efforts and improved 
environmental management. 

i v 
The CAS covers a per iod o f about three and a h a l f years (FYs03-06) in order to better a l ign w i t h 
Honduras' po l i t ica l cycle. Starting f r om a po r t fo l io and recent lend ing program dominated by investment 
projects, the CAS program envisages a moderate increase in programmatic approaches and quick-disbursing 
budgetary support but, given a continued need to strengthen institutional/technical capacity and pub l ic 
resource management, also maintains a substantial program o f investment operations. The a im i s to start 
using a programmatic approach in supporting implementation o f the PRSP, wh i le simultaneously 
strengthening the country's pub l ic f inanc ia l management and procurement systems in l i n e w i t h the 
recommendations o f key f iduc iary assessments, wh ich are now underway. As the f iduc iary environment 
improves and commitment to (and capacity for) effective PRSP implementation i s demonstrated, a higher 
propor t ion o f IDA assistance cou ld eventually be prov ided in the f o rm o f budgetary support. Ana ly t ic wo rk i s 
focused on Honduras-specific core diagnostic work and on Central Amer ica wide studies on sectoral topics 
such as the coffee shock, ru ra l growth, CAFTA , H I V / A ID S , decentralization and disaster m i t iga t ion . 

V. 

The IDA resource envelope fo r the four f isca l years covered by this CAS amounts to SDR211 (or 
approximately US$296 m i l l ion ) in the base case. The high case wou ld prov ide an additional SDR 63 m i l l i o n 
(about US$SS m i l l ion) , and wou ld be triggered on the basis o f accelerated implementation o f key PRSP 
objectives, improved pub l ic resource management and good IDA po r t fo l io performance, re f lec t ing adequate 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity to implement the program. Triggers fo r the high case inc lude general triggers as w e l l as 
operation-specific triggers linked to each o f two quick-disbursing credits contemplated in the h i g h case. 
However, at the present time, in the absence o f a satisfactory macroeconomic framework and uncertainties 
surrounding passage o f the c i v i l service re fo rm law, IDA assistance w i l l be l im i ted to the l o w case, wh ich 
includes investment lend ing o f SDR161 m i l l i o n or about US$226 m i l l ion . I t i s anticipated that these issues 
w i l l be addressed during the next 4-5 months, enabling a shift to the base case assistance scenario. 

vi. 
In tandem w i t h IDA, IFC and MIGA w i l l support the implementation o f Honduras' PRSP, w i t h a 
particular focus on i t s f i r s t p i l la r - accelerating equitable and sustainable growth. I F C and MIGA w i l l pursue 
their objectives i n partnership w i th the pr iva te sector through investment and non-investment vehicles. IFC 's 
approach in Honduras i s to support pr iva te sector development through activities at bo th the ind iv idua l 
country and reg iona l levels. 
I t s pr ior i t ies in Honduras over the CAS pe r iod w i l l include: (a) supporting 
grow th o f export-oriented SMEs (through f inanc ia l intermediaries and/or technical assistance); (b) supporting 
internationally competitive f i r m s w i t h inadequate long- term capital access; (c) he lp ing to strengthen the 
business environment (through technical assistance); and (d) supporting the f inanc ia l sector. The leve l o f 
f inanc ia l support f rom IFC in i t s areas o f emphasis w i l l continue to depend on viable investment opportunities 
in Honduras and the Central America reg ion as a whole. This, in turn, w i l l depend on overa l l improvements 
in the business environment, regulatory framework and macroeconomic stability. 

v i i 
Specific benchmarks have been iden t i f ied f o r evaluating the r e s u l t s and impac t o f the CAS. 
Outcome indicators are closely linked to the PRSP and MDG goals. Intermediate and process benchmarks are 
also included, wh ich help establish the links between Bank assistance and expected outcomes. However , the 
strategy faces a number o f important r i s k s w i t h respect t o po ten t ia l fo r macroeconomic ins tab i l i ty , po l i t ica l 
and social hurdles to po l icy re fo rm and weak ins t i tu t iona l capacity. The economic r i s k s arise f r om bo th 
external and domestic factors. On the external side, Honduras remains vulnerable to natural disasters and 
terms o f trade shocks, either o f wh ich cou ld derail i t s economic program. O n the in terna l side, economic 
stability cou ld be threatened b y f isca l slippages i n the face o f po l i t ica l exigencies o r b y the need fo r 
unanticipated expenditures in support o f the country's f rag i le bank ing system. On the po l i t ica l side, there i s 
some risk that the PRSP's ambitious leg is la t ive agenda cou ld become v i c t im to po l i t ica l g r id lock in Congress 
and/or that passage o f key f isca l measures cou ld provoke social unrest. F ina l ly , weak f inanc ia l management 
and ins t i tu t iona l capacity in the l ine m in is tr ies cou ld adversely affect program implementation. These r i s k s 
appear to be manageable, i n l igh t o f Government's demonstrated commitment to addressing them w i t h the 
support o f Honduran stakeholders and external partners, inc lud ing the IFIS.

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION AND 
THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION 
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A 
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR THE 

REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS 

I. 

THE COUNTRY CONTEXT 

Political Context 

1. 
Fo l low ing several decades o f authoritarian r u l e (both c iv i l ian and m i l i tary) , Honduras began a 
transition to democracy in the mid 1980’s. I t has since seen f ive successive, peaceful transitions o f power 
- ind ica t ing considerable ma tur ing o f the country’s democratic processes. The most recent transition 
occurred on January 27,2002, when President Ricardo Madu ro o f the Na t iona l Party (PN) assumed o f f ice 
fo r a four-year term, after w inn ing the November 2001 election w i t h over 52 percent o f the vote. 
Elections fo r the 128-member Honduran Congress were he ld in con junc t ion w i t h the presidential election, 
and, f o r the f i r s t time in recent history, did no t y ie ld a simple ma jo r i ty fo r the ruling party. A l though a 
governing coa l i t ion has been constituted through a fo rma l alliance between the P N and a m ino r party, the 
lack o f a clear ma jor i ty implies that the Executive needs to seek compromise solutions on many issues, in 
order to pass legislation and avo id the risk o f legislative gr id lock . Results o f loca l elections were also 
mixed, w i t h just 50 percent o f mun ic ipa l i t ies led b y the PN. This, in turn, has complicated progress on 
decentralization -and b y extension, improved services and social equity. 

2. 
The Maduro Government has given high p r io r i ty to poverty reduc t ion as the central theme o f i t s 
administration and moved qu ick ly to endorse the country’s October 2001 Pover ty Reduction Strategy 
Paper (PRSP), wh ich was developed under the previous Government, v ia a broad consultation process. 
The PRSP i s described in some de ta i l in the next section o f this report, as i t forms the basis fo r the Bank’s 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r FYs03-06, presented in this memorandum. I t should be noted 
here, however, that the Government faces an uphill battle in imp lemen t ing several aspects o f the PRSP. 
This i s especially true w i th regard to ma in ta in ing f isca l d isc ip l ine and increasing the sustainability o f 
pub l ic finances, inter alia through imp rov ing the e f f ic iency and targeting o f pub l ic expenditures. Many 
Hondurans believe that economic orthodoxy i s exacerbating the country’s high unemployment and 
poverty rates, and there have been numerous street demonstrations protesting conservative f isca l policies. 
Unions, wh ich are re la t ive ly well-organized in Honduras, have taken to the streets to demand higher 
wages (especially teachers and health workers), i n part to demand fu l f i l lmen t o f wage commitments made 
by the previous Government. Thus far, popular protests have been large ly peaceful although there i s 
some risk o f escalation in the future. 

3. 

Despite the above d i f f icu l t ies and some setbacks, Government has recently made a renewed 
commitment to reining in the f isca l de f ic i t and pub l ic debt as part o f an ongo ing e f fo r t to access H IPC 
debt-relief, PRGF resources f r om the IMF, and quick-disbursing funds f r om the IDB and W o r l d Bank i n 
support o f the country’s Poverty Reduc t ion Strategy (see section I1 below). I t s development strategy also 
places considerable emphasis on increasing democratization, v ia transparency and consultation, w i t h a 
v iew towards forg ing a sustained, durable societal consensus on the country’s development i s s u e s and the 
way forward. 
In this regard, a key p r io r i ty i s guaranteeing access to in fo rma t ion v ia a new Pub l ic 
Disclosure L aw and creating systems to prov ide credible in fo rma t ion on pub l ic expenditures and their 
impacts.

4. 
Recen t Developments. Over the past f ive years, the Honduran economy has been in a process o f 
recovery f r om the devastating impact o f Hurr icane M i tch , wh ich struck the region in October 1998. In 
addition to i t s tragic human to l l , M i t c h wreaked severe damage on the Honduran economy. Losses were 
estimated at about US$2.2 b i l l i o n fo r direct damage to property, and almost US$3.8 b i l l i o n fo r a l l losses 
inc lud ing indirects such as those resulting f rom suspension o f economic ac t iv i ty due to physical damage. 
The receipt o f generous support f r om the international commun i ty has since a l lowed Honduras to rebu i ld 
much o f i t s damaged infrastructure. 

5. 

O n the downside, the pos t-M i tch in f low o f fore ign assistance was a key factor in the appreciation 
o f the Lempira, wh ich appreciated b y 28 percent in rea l terms between 1997 and 2001. This exchange 
rate appreciation, and adverse external developments inc lud ing economic deceleration in the U S and other 
pr inc ipa l trad ing partners and worsening terms o f trade fo r key exports such as coffee, combined to 
dampen export performance. This, in turn, contributed to a generalized economic slow-down, 
exacerbated by a deterioration o f pub l ic finances and a res tr ic t ive monetary stance wh ich l im i ted pr iva te 
investment (Table 1).

When the Madu ro administration assumed o f f ice in January 2002, i t inher i ted a s low ing economy 
and a deteriorating f isca l balance under the previous Government, wh ich f e l l f r om a surplus o f 1.8 percent 
o f GDP in 1998 to a de f ic i t o f 2.3 percent in 2001. This deterioration resulted f r om the steady decline o f 
public revenues over the period, re f lec t ing the down turn in economic ac t iv i ty , sluggish tax co l lec t ion and 
a weaker operating surplus b y the pub l ic enterprises. At the same time, non-interest expenditures had 
steadily increased, ma in ly due to ba l loon ing o f central government wages resu l t ing f r om agreements 
reached b y the previous government w i t h c i v i l service unions. The new authorities introduced a package 
of revenue measures upon assuming office, but this has been insu f f ic ien t to ha l t the downward tendency 
in revenues thus far. O n the expenditures side, an increase in teachers’ compensation, negotiated i n the 
context o f commitments made b y the previous Government, generated fur ther upwa rd pressure on the 
pub l ic sector wage b i l l , wh ich reached 10.8 percent o f GDP in 2002 and i s s ign i f ican t ly higher than in 
other countries in the region. Fo r 2002, the total pub l ic sector de f ic i t reached 3.4 percent o f GDP, 
considerably above the ava i lab i l i ty o f concessional external financing. 

7. 

Despite the overa l l fiscal and grow th deterioration, however, some macroeconomic indicators 
have remained remarkably stable. In particular, in f la t ion has maintained i t s dec l in ing trend since 1998, 
re f lec t ing the application o f disciplined monetary policies as we l l as the overa l l economic slowdown. 
Another favorable development has been the maintenance o f a strong international reserves position, in 
spite o f dec l in ing exports. This pos i t ion was par t ly sustained in 2002, however, through the one-time 
repatriation o f assets held abroad by the national telephone u t i l i ty company. The Madu ro government has 
also revised Honduras’ exchange rate po l icy since 2002 in an e f for t t o rev i ta l ize exports. The change has 
led to a real depreciation o f the Lemp ira o f about 3.7 percent during 2002, although i t has no t reversed the 
accumulated appreciation that took place since 1997’. 

8. 
Medium-Term Outlook. A PRGF arrangement had been agreed w i t h the Fund in Ma rch 1999, 
after wh ich Honduras reached the H IPC Decision Po in t i n October 2000. This arrangement has been o f f - 
track since December 2001, in large measure due to the deteriorating f i s c a l situation and pub l ic sector 
wage bill, and expired at the end o f 2002. This has created considerable uncertainty about the future 
evo lu t ion o f f isca l balances in the medium-term and constrained the country’s ab i l i ty to implement i t s 
poverty reduction strategy. At the same time, the deviations f r om the f isca l targets and consequent 
derailment o f the PRGF arrangement, l e d to the postponement o f the H IPC Comp le t ion Point, wh ich was 
o r ig ina l ly envisaged to be reached at the end o f 2002. Since most o f the in te r im debt re l ie f contemplated 
under the H IPC in i t ia t ive has already been delivered, agreement on a new PRGF agreement i s v i ta l t o 
aver t ing a significant increase in Honduras’ debt servicing obligations, w i t h obvious imp l ica t ions fo r 
further pressure on the country’s fiscal position. 

9. 
The prospects fo r achievement o f a new PRGF arrangement have brightened in recent months. 
The Government and the IMF have reached preliminary agreement on overa l l macroeconomic objectives 
o f the program -- inc lud ing macroeconomic stability, protecting investment and p r io r i t iz ing poverty- 
reduc ing spending -- although po l icy instruments to achieve the objectives are s t i l l under discussion. 
Meanwhile, the Government i s developing important elements o f i t s strategy, inc lud ing a strengthened 
wage po l icy resulting f r om c i v i l service re fo rm and means o f strengthening the f inanc ia l sector. T h e 
program agreed thus far i s based on a gradual recovery o f economic g row th f r om 2.5 percent in 2002 to 
4.5 percent in 2005 and a gradual decline o f in f la t ion to 5 percent in 2005, wh i le a im ing fo r a modest 
accumulation o f reserves equivalent to f ive months’ wor th o f imports. The f isca l adjustment 
contemplated in the program calls fo r a reduction in the overa l l pub l ic sector de f ic i t to 2.5 percent o f GDP 
in 2003, 1.5 percentage points in 2004 and be low 1.0 percent b y 2005. This adjustment i s to be achieved 
ma in ly through: (i) passage o f a tax package to increase pub l ic revenues; (ii) containment o f the central 
government wage bill, in part through adoption o f a new c i v i l service framework l aw wh ich wou ld a l low 
fo r implementation o f a uniform, equitable and sustainable wage po l icy fo r a l l pub l ic sector employees; 
and (iii) ma in ta in ing o f the operating s u r p l u s o f the pub l ic enterprises at 2002 levels, v ia gradual 
adjustments to tar i f fs and containment o f wage increases. In add i t ion to these g row th and f isca l targets, 
the revised program w i l l ca l l for strengthening o f the f inanc ia l system and increased pr iva te par t ic ipa t ion 
in the telecommunications and e lec tr ic i ty sectors.

Prov ided the po l ic ies ou t l ined in the preceding paragraph are implemented satisfactorily, i t i s 
expected that i t w i l l be feasible fo r Honduras to attain external debt sustainability. G iven na r row ing o f 
the external current account de f ic i t to 4 percent o f GDP by 2004 (as export g row th p icks up), i t i s 
estimated that the external debt-to GDP ra t io wou ld decline steadily f r om 67 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 

’ The exchange rate i s determined through a system o f da i ly currency auctions b y the Central Bank w i th in a craw l ing 
band. The w id th o f this band i s 7 % on either side o f a “base rate”. The Authorities had been adjusting the base rate 
at a slower pace than the in f la t ion d i f feren t ia l between Honduras and i t s trading partners, wh ich led to a gradual 
appreciation. Since end-2001, the rate o f c raw l was increased to offset the expected in f la t ion differential. 

55 percent by 2007. Over the same period, the net present value (NPV) o f debt to current government 
revenue wou ld decline f r om 252 to 177 percent, we l l be low the debt sustainability threshold o f 250 
percent under the H IPC in i t ia t ive . See Annex F fo r further analysis o f Honduras’ debt.

Congress has just approved the new tax re fo rm package wh ich w i l l , inter alia, increase tax equity 
(through mak ing some bonus payments subject to tax and in troduc ing a temporary 5 percent solidarity 
pro f i ts tax), widen the tax base (through additional taxes on tobacco and alcohol and a new w i thho ld ing 
tax at wholesale leve l as w e l l as reduced exemptions in sales tax) and introduce measures to reduce f isca l 
evasion. The Government expects that the tax package w i l l y ie ld additional revenues o f about 3.3 percent 
o f GDP when i t i s f u l l y implemented. F o r 2003, add i t iona l revenues are expected to amount to about 2.0 
percent o f GDP. Consideration i s also be ing given to the design o f additional, contingent measures in the 
event that these expected revenue estimates do no t materialize. Ea r ly approval b y Congress o f 
Government’s proposed c i v i l service re fo rm law w i l l , together w i t h the tax reform, he lp smooth the way 
towards f ina l iza t ion o f a PRGF agreement w i t h the Fund. Government i s expected to submit the draft

coefficient i s 0.6), income pove r ty i s widespread. Nea r ly two- th irds o f the popu la t ion i s poor and nearly

indicates, poverty headcounts f e l l steadily, albeit s low ly , f r om 1991 to 1998, before rising again in the last 
year o f the decade fo l low ing the onslaught o f humcane M i t c h . The effect o f M i t c h was more pronounced 
in the (already poorer) ru ra l areas, g iven extensive crop damage a f fec t ing bo th ow n produc t ion and 
opportunities fo r agr icu l tura l labor. W h i l e the impac t o f M i t c h on urban labor incomes was less severe, 
many urban households, l i k e their ru ra l counterparts, suffered f r om a loss in assets and incurred direct

Wh i le absolute levels o f poverty f e l l dur ing the 1990s, re la t ive levels o f poverty increased 
somewhat, as measured by increased inequality in pe r capita income - an impor tan t dimension, g iven 
that ind iv idua ls often assess their well-being in comparison to others, rather than in absolute terms. 
Analysis using three d i f feren t measures o f inequality con f irms that inequa l i ty increased by about 3 
percentage po in ts nationally f r om 1991-99. In urban areas, there was a decrease in inequa l i ty but this was 
offset in the overa l l numbers by a marked increase in ru ra l areas. Moreover, the inequality between 
u rban and rural areas has r isen , con tr ibu t ing to national inequality. Thus on bo th absolute and re la t ive 
poverty dimensions, ru ra l households fare worse than urban households, ind ica t ing an urgent need to 
develop programs targeted to the ru ra l poor-and, 
g iven rap id ru ra l to urban migration, to improve 
services and income-earning opportunities in marginal urban areas, where most recent migrants settle. 

14. 
Apar t f r om rural-urban location, there i s an important gender dimension to income poverty in 
Honduras. Analysis o f poverty data suggests that female-headed households have per capita incomes that 
are 15 to 30 percent lowe r than male-headed households, large ly re f lec t ing household labor scarcity and 
the generally lower human capital and asset ownership o f women. This i s supported by evidence showing 
that male-headed households w i t h on ly one wo rk ing adult (Le., the woman i s generally no t in the labor 
force) are also substantially poorer on average - once again suggesting the need fo r improved 
employment, tra in ing and earning opportunities fo r women. F ina l ly , findings that households w i th a large 
number o f ch i ldren have s ign i f ican t ly lowe r per capita consumption than smaller households, underscore 
the need f o r policies enabling women to take con t ro l o f the ir fe r t i l i ty , w i t h the l ike ly effect o f lowe r ing 
birth rates and increasing consumption, as resources wou ld need to be shared by fewer household 
members. 

Access to Services 

15. While progress in addressing income poverty has been s low in Honduras, due largely to sluggish 
GDP growth, the country has been much more successful in imp rov ing basic and social services. 
Comparatively good performance in hea lth and education i s re f lec ted in the Human Development 
Index3 (HDI) wh ich i s s l igh t ly above expectations fo r the country’s per capita GDP leve l . Th is i s at least 
par t ia l ly attributable to the high p r io r i ty attached b y successive Honduran administrations to pro tec t ing 
spending on education and health care, par t icu lar ly at the basic levels. Thus, desp i te a reduction in pub l ic 
deficits and rap id popu la t ion g row th i n the 1990s, basic expenditures per capita in bo th education and 
health actually increased over the period. This in turn has a l lowed f o r expanded coverage o f basic social 
services w i t h positive outcomes fo r the poor. Over the past decade, health service prov is ion has improved 
markedly: vaccination programs achieved near-100 percent coverage; maternal mo r ta l i ty f e l l b y 38 
percent ( to 108 per 100,000) between 1990 and 1997; chron ic ma lnu t r i t ion in ch i ldren 1-5 years declined 
f rom 44 percent in 1987 to under 33 percent in 2001; and, in fan t mo r ta l i ty declined, albeit more slowly, 

The HDI i s a weighted sum o f three indices dealing w i th l i f e expectancy, educational attainment and per capita GDP. 

f r om 39 per 1,000 in the 1986-1990 per iod to 34 per 1,000 in 1996-2000. S im i lar improvements are 
observable in education where the ne t primary school enrollment rate i s now about 85 percent, i l l i te racy 
has fa l len f r om 29 to 19 percent between 1990 and 2000 and improvements in access to early ch i ldhood 
and secondary education have taken place, although absolute levels are s t i l l low . Despite these advances, 
health and education indicators s t i l l lag considerably beh ind those o f almost a l l the countries i n Central 
Amer ica and there are s t i l l important inequities in qua l i ty and access. M o r e concerted efforts, inc lud ing 
demand side measures as we l l as improved program e f f ic iency w i l l be needed in the com ing years in 
order to achieve the MDG targets and/or those laid out in Honduras’ PRSP. 

16. 
The population’s access to basic infrastructure services has also expanded considerably in recent 
years. O f f i c i a l statistics indicate that 89 percent o f the popu la t ion has access to po tab le w a t e r - one o f 
the highest coverage rates in Central America. However, continuity, re l iab i l i ty and qua l i ty o f service i s 
poor, im p l y i n g the need fo r major changes in sector performance in order to meet the MDG goal o f 
reduc ing by h a l f the number o f people w i th sustainable access to an improved water source. Currently, 
coverage numbers mask huge disparities in continuity o f water service par t icu lar ly in marg ina l urban 
areas, where several communities have to cope w i t h in term i t ten t d is tr ibu t ion o f water, sometimes 
amounting to on ly one hour o f water service every four days. Future progress w i l l also be made d i f f icu l t 
b y the fact that the ma jor i ty o f those currently w i thou t access l i v e in hard-to-reach dispersed ru ra l 
communities o r marginal urban areas. The p ic ture w i t h regard to sanitation i s s im i lar to that fo r water. 
Wh i le Honduras has made important headway in imp rov ing coverage o f san itat ion services fo r the 
popu la t ion as a whole (reaching 70 percent in 2002), there are a number o f concerns related to the type o f 
infrastructure services, environmental impacts and sustainability o f investments. Wh i le coverage has 
indeed expanded in ru ra l areas ( f rom 3 1 to 72 percent over the past decade), this has been ma in ly through 
“latrinization” wh ich has a l im i ted l i f e and wh ich must be accompanied b y improved hygiene in fo rma t ion 
and practices to realize the full health benefits. Moreover, waste disposal remains a ma jor challenge in 
large urban centers, where untreated waste water i s s t i l l sometimes dumped in to rivers and in fo rma l 
dumping o f so l id waste i s common, w i t h po ten t ia l ly serious health consequences. Coverage o f e lectr ic ity 
services showed improvement during the 1990s, rising f r om 33 percent o f households to 52 percent o f 
households between 1989 and 1999, w i th the increase bene f i t ing bo th middle-income and poor 
households. In contrast, t ranspo r ta t ion services, wh i le expanding, have no t reached poor Hondurans. 
Household data indicate that 63 percent o f people in the lowest income qu in t i le have no access to 
transportation and less than a quarter use buses as a p r inc ipa l means o f transport. 

PRSP T a rg e t s and the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goa ls 

17. 
In summary, as suggested in the preceding discussion o f the macro-economy and social welfare, 
Honduras’ prospects fo r meeting the targets l a i d out in the PRSP, and, b y extension, the MDGs fo r 2015, 
are uncertain. Table 4 provides an overv iew o f the PRSP targets and MDGs as applied to Honduras as 
we l l as the current status w i t h respect to each target. As ind ica ted in the table, overa l l trends on most 
indicators have been favorable fo r the past 10-12 years and many targets cou ld be achieved i f past trends 
continue unabated. However, progress in the f i r s t year since f ina l iza t ion o f the country’s PRSP in late 
2001 has fa l len short o f expectations in a number o f areas (though numbers are s t i l l be ing refined), wh ich 
casts doubt on successful implementation o f the strategy unless there i s a qu ick improvement in 
implementation performance. This i s especially true in tw o areas -- in fan t mo r ta l i ty and environmental 
sustainability -- where even projections based on the 1990s’ performance suggest that achievement o f the 
2015 targets i s un l ike ly w i thou t substantial additional e f for ts in the future. In add i t ion to implementation 
problems (associated w i t h weak capacity and, in some cases, strong po l i t ica l opposition to po l icy reform), 
poor performance in mov ing forward PRS targets during 2001-2 i s related to shortcomings in the 
operationalization o f the pover ty reduction strategy. This invo lved bundling a number o f a relatively 
unfocussed set o f projects in to a core “anti-poverty” program, without adequately analyzing the relationship

multi-year budgetary process, to c la r i fy the relationship between ma in programs and complementary

requested to assist in this e f for t .

Wh i le many o f the specific implementation problems wh ich hindered progress last year can be 
(and are being) resolved, the ovemd ing challenge fo r the longer term i s to break the cyc le o f low , and 
narrowly-based, grow th in wh ich Honduras i s m i red i f progress on PRSP and MDG targets i s to be 
accelerated in the future. T o be able to come near the PRSP and M i l l e n n i um Development Goa l (MDG) 
o f cu t t ing extreme poverty in h a l f by 2015, Honduras w i l l have to grow substantially faster than i t s 
historic grow th performance, wh ich has been among the least dynamic in L a t i n and Central America. 
Moreover, structural and social barriers to broad-based par t ic ipa t ion in economic g row th w i l l need to be 
addressed energetically to raise the economy’s poverty reduction/growth elasticity ratio, wh ich i s 
currently very l o w at about 0.65. During the 1990s, annual grow th per capita averaged on ly 0.2 percent 
per annum. Recent studies reveal that this slow g row th performance i s no t due to insu f f ic ien t factor 
accumulation, as to ta l investment ratios and labor grow th are generally high b y L a t i n Amer ican standards. 
Rather, the country’s slow g row th i s ma in ly attributable to l o w to ta l factor produc t iv i ty (TFP) growth, 
wh ich reflects deficiencies in the allocation and e f f ic iency o f factor resource use . Wh i le the grow th rate 
was better in the 1990s than in the 1980s, re f lec t ing modest progress in addressing structural and 
ins t i tu t iona l reforms, a more comprehensive and intense e f fo r t i s needed in the com ing years i f the 
Honduran economy i s to be extricated f r om i t s l o w g r ow t h h i g h pover ty trap. Pre l im inary analyses 
suggest that the greatest opportunities fo r ra is ing Honduras’ economic g row th and making i t more 
inclusive l i e in the areas o f increasing human capital (particularly education), expanding infrastructure 
and deepening the f inanc ia l sector. F ina l ly , Honduras’ weak governance i s also an impediment t o 
building investor confidence. Governance-improving reforms are needed to restore private sector 
dynamism, wh ich w i l l be essential fo r sustained growth. These issues w i l l be explored further in a 
Development Po l icy Rev iew (DPR), wh ich i s currently be ing undertaken b y the Bank in close 
coordination w i t h the Honduras’ Government. 

11. HONDURAS’GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY 

19. 
As noted in para 2, Honduras’ Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), wh ich was completed 
in October 2001 fo l low ing an extensive consultation process, has placed poverty reduc t ion squarely at the 
center o f the Government’s development agenda. The ma in ob jec t ive o f the strategy, wh ich analyzes the 
causes o f poverty and encompasses investment programs and re forms in a broad range o f sectors, i s to 
reduce poverty by 24 percent po in ts over the per iod 2001-2015. Overall, the PRSP presents a coherent 
and credible - i f ambitious --strategy to reduce poverty in Honduras and i s consistent w i t h the poverty 
diagnosis. The strategy i t s e l f i s structured around six pillars as fo l lows : (i) accelerating equitable and 
sustainable growth to levels consistent w i t h the income pover ty reduc t ion targets; (ii) reducing ru ra l 
poverty; (iii) reducing urban poverty; ( iv ) enhancing investment in human capital; (v) strengthening 
social protection fo r specific vulnerable groups; and, (v i) ensuring the sustainability o f the strategy 
through governance and ins t i tu t iona l reforms and enhanced env ironmen ta l sustainability. Each o f these 
programmatic areas (both key i s s u e s and pr ior i t ies) i s described be low i n some detail, as the pover ty 
reduction strategy forms the basis fo r the Bank’s assistance strategy t o Honduras. The discussion o f 
programmatic areas focuses on Honduras’ progress in PRSP imp lemen ta t ion and h igh l igh ts new issues 
and approaches that Government i s considering under the framework as experience w i t h the strategy 
evolves. A PRSP Progress Repor t wh ich i s currently under preparation b y Government and has been 
circulated f o r consultations maintains the same long- term v is ion and targets o f the PRSP. B o x A and 
Annex D prov ide summaries o f the dra f t report. 

Pillar I: Accelerating Equitable and Sustainable Growth 

20. 

A fundamental element o f this pillar i s the establishment and maintenance o f a stable 
macroeconomic framework as the foundation fo r pr iva te investment/employ'ment creation and a 
sustainable program o f enhanced pub l ic spending on pover ty reduction. The macroeconomic program 
la id out in the PRSP focuses on ma in ta in ing sound monetary and exchange rate po l ic ies to ensure single- 
digit in f la t ion and interest rates favorable to investment, wh i le re in ing in the f isca l de f ic i t , inter alia, via: 
(i) tax reforms and improved tax administration to increase revenues; and (ii) exer t ing firm con t ro l on 
expenditures, inc lud ing through establishment o f equitable pub l ic sector salaries and a comprehensive 
c i v i l service re fo rm law . The PRSP also lays out specific targets fo r monetary, f isca l and structural 
reforms, wh ich underpinned Honduras arrangement w i t h the IMF f o r continued support f r om the PRGF. 
However, as discussed above, the Government was unab le t o achieve these targets and the PRGF program 
has consequently been o f f- track since December 2001. As also noted prev ious ly (para 9 ) , the 
Government and IMF have recently agreed on revised macroeconomic targets and structural reforms, and 
Government i s in the process o f rev is ing the PRSP to re f lec t the new agreements and serve as the basis 
fo r a possible new PRGF arrangement (expected later this year). The Government i s curren t ly making 
concerted efforts to address f isca l issues, in l ine w i t h the revised targets and structural benchmarks, but 
the outcome remains uncertain given tough po l i t ica l obstacles.

21. 

In tegra l to the focus on re-establishing a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, a second area o f 
re fo rm emphasized w i th in the PRSP’s g row th pillar relates to the continued strengthening o f the 
country’s f inanc ia l system, wh ich i s beset b y a number o f problems. Recent actions t o improve the 
f inanc ia l system include imp rov ing the lega l framework fo r supervision o f the f inanc ia l system, ra is ing 
minimum cap i ta l requirements fo r banks, and fostering systemic s tab i l i ty b y l iqu ida t ing two insolvent 
banks and cap i ta l iz ing two others. No tw i ths tand ing these efforts, the bank ing system has remained 
fragile. Po r t fo l io quality, provisions against losses and the r isk-we igh ted cap i ta l iza t ion leve l are among 
the lowest in the region and discipline has been weakened by successive bailouts o f agr icu l tura l debtors 
and regulatory forbearance fo r banks, leading, in turn, to undistributed losses h idden in bank balance 
sheets. In addition, a blanket deposit guarantee has led to a large f isca l contingency - par t o f wh ich has 
already materialized. F ina l ly , the Honduras authorities are concerned that the leve l o f penetration o f 
money laundering in the f inanc ia l sector may be significant, given drug t ra f f ick ing and other c r im ina l 

ac t iv i ty in the region. In 2002, Honduras enacted a new an t i money-laundering law that s ign i f ican t ly 
enhances the legal framework and available investigative and prosecutorial tools in the fight against 
money laundering. The l aw i s a ma jo r step forward, but considerable fur ther e f fo r t i s needed to 

implement it. In this context, the Government requested the IMF and the Bank t o undertake an 
assessment o f Honduras’ f inanc ia l sector w i t h a v iew to iden t i fy ing weaknesses and specific areas fo r 
improvement. This assessment (FSAP) was completed in February 2003 and i t s key findings are 
described in B o x B above. Government has indicated i t s strong commitment to addressing the issues 
iden t i f ied and has requested assistance f rom the I F I s in support o f a sectoral re fo rm program. 

22. 
The third key component o f the PRSP’s grow th pillar, aims at strengthening private investment 
levels and imp rov ing investment efficiency, in order to increase employment opportunities f o r the 
Honduran people. Wh i le recognizing the c r i t ica l importance o f a sustainable macroeconomic framework 
and sound f inanc ia l system fo r increasing productive investment, the PRSP also aims to address a number 
o f regulatory, ins t i tu t iona l and structural factors, wh ich constrain pr iva te sector investment and 
produc t iv i ty in Honduras. These include: (i) the investment climate, inc lud ing burdensome regulation fo r 
business registrations; (ii) l o w qua l i ty o f infrastructure services and high log is t ics costs; (iii) limited use 
o f technology and innova t ion and lack o f qua l i ty systems; and ( iv) labor market r ig id i ty and l o w labor 
s k i l l s . T o address these constraints, Honduras has passed an Adm in is tra t ive S imp l i f ica t ion L a w to 
s imp l i fy regulations fo r establishing businesses, and i s curren t ly wo rk ing on the reactivation o f a one-stop 
w indow fo r investment applications, re fo rm o f the Labo r Code, modernization o f the Commercial Code, 
resolution o f property insecurity issues , and measures to substantially increase pr iva te par t ic ipa t ion in the 
prov is ion o f pub l ic services ( inc lud ing e lec tr ic i ty generation, airports, water and sewerage, transport and 
telecommunications). Wh i le some progress has been made in the latter area, e f for ts to deepen pr iva te 
involvement in infrastructure prov is ion have been hampered by weaknesses i n the ex is t ing regulatory 
framework, weak pub l ic confidence in the benefits o f pr iva t iza t ion and po l i t ica l opposition b y vested 
interest groups. 
23. 
Wh i le the constraints to private investment iden t i f ied above a f fec t a l l f i r m s , the PRSP calls fo r 
special attention to two groups o f h igh-potent ia l business sectors. The f i r s t o f these i s the micro-, small- 
and medium-enterprises (MSMEs) group f o r whom the cost o f regulatory constraints i s especially high. 
H igher g row th in the M S M E sector i s especially valued f r om a pover ty reduc t ion standpoint because 
these businesses tend to be generally more labor-intensive than larger f i r m s . The second group consists 
o f f i r m s operating in industries w i th high comparative advantages, such as tourism, maquila, non- 
traditional agriculture and forestry, where investments wou ld p rov ide a qu icker re turn t o the country’s 
overa l l produc t iv i ty and economic growth. To further the development o f these two groups o f businesses, 
the Government has recently established a Na t iona l Competitiveness Council, tasked w i t h defining and 
fac i l i ta t ing the implementation o f strategies fo r developing key clusters, inc lud ing productive linkages 
and improved access to f inanc ing v ia the bank ing system. 

24. 
A f ina l area o f emphasis w i th in the PRSP’s g row th p i l la r , relates to imp rov ing Honduras’ 
competitive access to internat iona l markets. In this regard, high p r io r i ty i s g iven to strengthening 
Honduran par t ic ipa t ion in the Centra l American integration scheme, inc lud ing comp le t ing actions to 
establish a customs un ion w i t h Guatemala, E l Salvador and Nicaragua (and possible extension to Costa 
Rica), harmonization o f tariffs, reduction o f non - ta r i f f bamers and p romo t ing the creation o f a reg iona l 
capital market and a Central Amer ican Log is t ics Corr idor . M o v i n g beyond the immediate region, the 
PRSP also emphasizes the need to enlarge and improve trade relations w i t h a number o f farther neighbors 
- Canada, Chile, Dom in ican Republic, Mex ico and Panama -- w i t h a v iew towards e f fec t ive inc lus ion i n 
the Free Trade Agreement o f the Americas. Wh i le Honduras already has lowered tar i f fs quite 
dramatically during the 1990s (average about 8 percent) and has d ive rs i f ied i t s exports (maqu i la and non- 
traditional agriculture), fur ther advances in openness and in tegra t ion w i t h more dynamic markets cou ld 
o f fer significant r e s u l t s in terms o f enhancing TFP and a t trac t ing new investments/technologies. 

25. 

Since comp le t ion o f the PRSP, discussions have also been in i t ia ted between the countries o f 
Central Amer ica and the Un i ted States on the establishment o f a Cen t ra l Amer ica F ree Trade Agreement 

(CAFTA). The Honduran government has been a strong supporter o f the C A F T A process since the 
agreement wou ld o f fer an important opportunity fo r Honduras t o sh i f t to a higher g row th trajectory. 
Expectations are that C A F T A cou ld be he lp fu l inter a l ia by : (i) making market access more permanent 
and granting investors a fuller set o f protection and dispute resolution rules; and (ii) impos ing on 
Honduras an ob l iga t ion to upgrade many o f i t s own rules and institutions (e.g., in in te l lec tua l property 
rights, labor4 and environment) w i th the l ike ly impact o f boos t ing bo th fore ign and domestic investment 
as we l l as ra is ing TFF. I t should be noted, though that C A F T A also entails some r i s k s . Ch ie f among 
these i s that fa i lure to accompany C A F T A w i t h key complementary actions such as investments in 
infrastructure, upgrading o f education systems and improvements i n investment c l ima te cou ld mean that 
fore ign investment does no t materialize (or worse, i s d iver ted f r om Honduras to other C A countries). 
W i t h regard to investment climate, Honduras needs to pay particular attention to concerns surrounding 
cr ime and violence, property rights and jud ic ia l e f f ic iency . Second i s a r i s k that C A F T A benefits are 
captured on ly by small clusters o f (large) f i r m s and re la t ive ly better o f f laborers - suggesting the need to 
invest in building the capacity o f small and medium enterprises to bene f i t f r om C A F T A . The 
Government i s well-aware o f these r i s k s and i s wo rk ing (w i th external support) to t ry to m i t iga te them. 

Pillar 11: Reducing Rural Pove r ty 

26. 
In recogn i t ion o f the severe poverty and inequ i t ies pervading ru ra l Honduras, the PRSP stresses 
implementation o f a comprehensive strategy to improve access to productive assets, infrastructure, 
markets and technology fo r poor smallholders. This i s seen as c r i t ica l ly important in the overa l l e f fo r t to 
reduce poverty since over 50 percent o f the Honduran popu la t ion and a disproportionately high share o f 
the poor l i v e in ru ra l areas. Indeed, the rural economy has been basically stagnant in the latter half o f the 
1990s. Agr icu l ture has grown at barely 0.3 percent per year since the m id - l990s , re f lec t ing exogenous 
factors ( fa l l ing commodity prices, natural disasters), macroeconomic conditions (exchange rate 
overvaluation, high in teres t rates) and ins t i tu t iona l and program weaknesses. The strategy f o r rural 
poverty reduction la id out in the PRSP includes three ma in components as described below. 

27. 
The first component o f the second p i l la r aims to improve access to land v ia several actions 
inc lud ing enlargement o f an ex is t ing land regularization program cover ing sma l l independent farmers, 
strengthening land rights o f indigenous and A fro /Honduran groups, comp le t ion o f a na t ionw ide agrarian 
and forest cadastre, imp lemen t ing a ru ra l property registry, developing programs to p rov ide the ru ra l 
landless poor w i t h access to productive lands and recogn iz ing trad i t iona l rights and usufruct on pub l ic 
lands (wh ich constitute some 70 percent o f the to ta l land area). In each o f these areas special attention 
wou ld be pa id to ensuring the property rights o f women, bo th single women and women in ma r i ta l 
unions. Indeed, Honduras has made considerable progress on the ins t i tu t iona l and lega l aspects o f land 
reform, focus ing on modernizing the cadastre and registration system na t ionw ide w i th support f r om the 
USAID, IDB and the Bank. 
In addition, an agreement has been reached between the executive and 
jud ic ia l branches to integrate the cadastre and rea l estate registries. These reforms are expected to go a 
l o n g way towards regu lar iz ing ownership and p rov id ing the conditions fo r a transparent and e f f ic ien t land 
market. This, in turn, should have a ma jor impac t on pover ty reduction, g iven that most unregistered, 
in fo rma l land assets (estimated value o f US$12 b i l l ion ) are owned b y poor households. However, 
continued intensive efforts to maintain progress on land regu lar iza t ion w i l l s t i l l be needed and 
inexpensive and expedient procedures fo r con f l ic t resolution, inc lud ing v ia the jud ic ia l system, need t o be 
established. 

I t should be noted that Honduras has ra t i f ied all international conventions related to core labor standards ( inc lud ing 
freedom o f association and collective bargaining, elimination o f forced and compulsory labor, e l im ina t ion o f 
discrimination w i th respect to employment and occupation, and the abo l i t ion o f ch i ld labor). However, various 
provisions in the existing labor law - wh ich i s currently being revised - place some restrictions on freedom o f 
association. Moreover, better enforcement i s needed w i th respect to a l l core labor standards. 

28. 
A second emphasis under P i l la r I1 i s to promote sustainable development in priority areas 
through broadening the Honduran Secretary o f Agriculture’s Na t iona l Sustainable Ru ra l Development 
Program (PRONADERS) and i t s supporting services. PRONADERS coordinates some 18 participatory 
projects targeted to smallholders to increase produc t iv i ty v ia improved natural resource management, 
crop diversification, quality improvements and production and marketing support services. During the 
last year, substantial expansion was in fact achieved, w i th PRONADERS bene f i t ing nearly 95,000 ru ra l 
households (i.e., close to 600,000 people). This in i t ia t ive , combined w i t h favorable weather and passage 
o f the So l idar i ty w i th the Farming Sector Law , appears to have achieved good outcomes thus far. 
Ag r icu l tu ra l outputs have increased s ign i f ican t ly between 2001 and 2002. F o r example, co rn produc t ion 
rose f r om 840 m i l l i o n lbs to about 1,110 m i l l i o n lbs, the production o f beans increased f r om 90 m i l l i o n 
lbs to 100 m i l l i o n lbs and r ice production went f r om 20 m i l l i o n lbs to 50 m i l l i o n lbs. Ano ther focus o f 
this component relates to the d ivers i f ica t ion o f sources o f ru ra l income inc lud ing v ia sma l l forestry 
schemes and tour ism development in the coastal areas and in the Copan valley, wh ich contains one o f the 
most significant Mayan s i tes in Central America. W h i l e , progress on tour ism i s proceeding satisfactorily, 
par t icu lar ly in the Copan Va l ley (in part w i t h Bank assistance), efforts to promote forestry have been 
hampered by the con f l ic t ive situation around forest land tenure and usufruct in the pub l ic forest lands, an 
obsolete centralized ins t i tu t iona l framework, a lega l framework wh ich i s dispersed and contradictory, and 
a lack o f policies and instruments to increase pr iva te and commun i ty investment in sustainable forestry 
activities. E f fo r ts to address these weaknesses v ia a new Forestry law have been impeded b y strong and 
competing po l i t ica l , economic and social interests. 

29. 
P i l la r I1 also calls fo r improvements to ru ra l infrastructure ( inc lud ing rebu i ld ing damaged rural 
roads and bridges, increasing m icro- irr iga t ion schemes and expanded ru ra l electrification), development 
o f “campesino” enterprises through business and technical tra in ing fo r sma l l ru ra l entrepreneurs prov is ion 
o f pr iva t ized technical services (extension, training, research) and imp roved access t o credit. The 
Government has recorded some progress in each o f these areas during the f i r s t year o f PRSP 
implementation, albeit slower than had o r ig ina l ly been targeted. Mos t notably, i r r iga t ion was expanded 
b y about 90 km2, p r inc ipa l ly f o r hor t icu l tura l export produc t ion such as cantaloupe, vegetables, manioc 
and others. Pr iva t ized extension services (supported by the Bank and FAD , among others) have greatly 
enhanced Government’s technical assistance and tra in ing outreach to poor ru ra l households. Credit, too 
increased by nearly 67 percent over the previous year, though this reflects bo th debt readjustment 
operations as we l l as new lend ing to productive units. Some progress o n ru ra l e lec tr i f ica t ion has also 
been made in par t w i t h support f r om the IDB and the Japanese and Taiwanese Governments. F ina l ly , 
continued progress was made in repa ir ing damage to infrastructure as a result o f Hurr icane M i t c h and in 
expanding social infrastructure and the scope o f poverty reduc t ion programs in the poorest ru ra l areas. 

Pillar III: Reducing U r b a n Poverty 

30. 

Wh i le ru ra l poverty i s a tremendous challenge i n Honduras today, there are also pockets o f severe 
poverty in large and intermediate cities, wh ich are g row ing at about 4 percent per year and wh ich require 
a d i f feren t set o f measures than the ones iden t i f ied above to assist the ru ra l poor . T o this end, the PRSP’s 
third p i l la r focuses on means o f imp rov ing the welfare o f poor urban households. A key element o f the 
strategy fo r urban poverty reduc t ion emphasizes the need fo r wo rk ing through mun ic ipa l i t ies in bo th large 
and intermediate cities to prov ide improved infrastructure inc lud ing l o w cost housing and basic services 
such as water, sewerage, e lec tr ic i ty and transport t o the urban poo r - i n part through the establishment o f 
a mun ic ipa l development fund. While investments i n basic services have progressed satisfactorily, there 
i s considerable concem that these may no t be sustainable in the long-run, g iven deficiencies in the 
regulatory framework. As suggested in para 16, this i s especially true in the water and sanitation sector, 
where devolution o f responsibilities to municipalities, pr iva t iza t ion and the development o f an appropriate 
incentive structure fo r providers has been occurr ing in an ad hoc manner, leav ing some mun ic ipa l i t ies far 
better served than others. Moreover, the p ic tu re i s fur ther comp l ica ted b y the existence o f mu l t ip le lega l 

frameworks fo r water, wh ich a l low several agencies the ro le o f po l icy development, regulation and 
operation. E f fo r ts to pass a comprehensive water sector re fo rm have been stalled in Congress, due to 
strong po l i t ica l opposition f r om vested interests. 

31. 
F ina l ly , in order to improve employment opportunities in urban areas, this pillar places high 
p r io r i ty on strengthening the micro-, small- and medium-enterprise (MSME) sector, wh ich accounts fo r 
nearly h a l f o f the country’s GDP and a s t i l l-h igher propor t ion o f employment f o r the active population. 
However, as suggested in the discussion o f overa l l private investment constraints under P i l la r I (paras 22- 
23), MSMEs - in part because o f their smaller size --are more constrained (than large f i r m s ) b y the 
burdensome regulations, high transactions costs and poor log is t ics wh ich characterize Honduras’ business 
climate. They are also disproportionately affected b y credit constraints and the paucity o f relevant 
information, and knowledge and advisory services. In addition, the ins t i tu t iona l framework in support o f 
M SM E s i s fragmented, dup l ica t ive and often inappropriately oriented - in many instances the institutions 
are more oriented towards re l iev ing poverty than imp rov ing M SM E s p roduc t iv i ty and sustainable growth. 
In recent years, the Government has made some progress towards he lp ing M SM E s to benefit f rom i t s 
economic po l ic ies and become an engine fo r future growth. First, respons ib i l i ty fo r support to MSMEs 
was moved f r om the Social Investment Fund (FHIS) to the M in is t ry o f Trade and Indus try . In addition, 
Government created the Na t iona l Commission fo r M ic ro - and Small-Enterprises to beg in coordinating the 
various meso-level activities (NGOs, micro-finance ins t i tu t ions and t ra in ing programs) targeted to 
MSMEs and has begun strengthening M S M E associations as a vehicle f o r p rov is ion o f business and 
technical tra in ing and knowledge services. 

Pillar IV : Investing in Human Capital 

32. 
As noted in para 15, Honduras has made considerable progress in increasing access to education 
and health over the past decade, but human capital indicators remain lowe r than those o f many o f i t s 
neighbors. Ana lys is o f the country’s education sector indicates that the average leve l o f education o f the 
population aged 10 years and older i s s t i l l low , at 4.7 years, and that the gross comp le t ion rates o f ch i ldren 
enrolled in pr imary education i s on ly 69 percent. Wh i le there has been substantial improvement in 
pr imary education coverage and literacy indicators in recent years, high repe t i t ion rates, large proportions 
o f over-age students, and unacceptably high dropout rates are hav ing a serious impac t on the e f f ic iency 
and performance o f Honduras’s educational system. Indeed, 26.1 and 17.5 percent respectively o f to ta l 
social expenditures are absorbed b y repeaters and dropouts. In addition, coverage at secondary school 
leve l i s very l o w at 35 percent, and preschool education (one grade p r i o r to p r ima ry schooling) covers 
on ly 42 percent o f the 5.5-6.5 year o l d cohort. The return on education i s s t i l l the lowest in the countries 
o f Central America, re f lec t ing l o w quality. 
T h i s , in turn, has depressed demand fo r education in 
Honduras. G iven this context, the PRSP places high p r io r i ty on strengthening the education sector and 
lays out the core elements o f a strategy fo r improvement at the various levels o f education. 

33. 
In light o f the PRSP targets and ove ra l l poverty reduc t ion objectives, highest p r io r i ty w i th in the 
strategy i s g iven to the improvement o f access and qua l i ty in basic education (grades 1-9), wh ich have 
been the focus o f Government attention over the past year. Government, w i t h donor and N G O support, 
has achieved some important advances in imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f basic education including re fo rm ing 
the curriculum, in troduc ing active and participatory pedagogical methods, imp rov ing ins truc t iona l 
materials and teacher training, and mon i to r ing education qua l i ty through sample-based standardized 
testing in 3‘d and 6” grade (and 9” grade to be implemented f o r the school year 2003). However, fo r these 
efforts to have a measurable impac t in the classroom, concerted e f fo r t w i l l also be needed to substantially 
improve the management o f human resources in the education sector. In recent years, weak management 
o f school calendars and da i ly schedules has led to a significant reduc t ion in e f fec t ive class time, and the 
situation has been exacerbated b y h igh teacher absenteeism due in par t to the occurrence o f frequent 

teachers’ strikes. As a result, students on ly receive ins truc t ion fo r an average o f 100-1 10 days per year 
( fo r 3-4 hours each day) - i.e., on ly about 30 per cent o f the t ime needed to complete curricular goals. 

34. 
Despite this abysmal performance, pay rises fo r teachers have continued unabated. Teacher 
salaries have increased 62 percent in the last fou r years under a special wage regime (Estatutos de 
Docentes) approved by Congress in 1997. In 2002, the new administration took steps to reverse this trend 
by phasing the wage increases scheduled fo r that year over a four-year per iod extending t o 2005, after 
wh ich a l l increases wou ld be t ied to increases i n the minimum wage (indexed to the CPI) and subject to 
the ava i lab i l i ty o f budgetary resources. However, even this (more favorable) deal w i l l continue to have a 
sizable impac t on the pub l ic sector wage b i l l and c rowd out other planned education expenditures fo r 
improvements in coverage and quality. Passage o f the comprehensive c i v i l service re fo rm law, wh ich the 
Government i s currently presenting to Congress (para ll), cou ld help ameliorate the situation f r om a 
f isca l angle - at least in the med ium term--but improved management o f schools w i l l also be necessary to 
enforce improved wo rk d isc ip l ine on the part o f teachers and administrators. 
In this regard, a core 
p r io r i ty fo r re fo rm in the education sector concerns systematic expansion (especially in ru ra l areas) o f a 
mode l fo r school-based management w i th commun i ty par t ic ipa t ion wh ich has been p i lo ted under the so- 
called PROHECO scheme, supported by the Bank. 

35. 
F ina l ly , given the large number o f donors active in the education sector in Honduras each w i t h 
separate ring-fenced projects, complicated administrative procedures and d i f fe r ing objectives, 
Government has been stressing the need to develop a common v is ion for, and coordinated support of, 
education development in Honduras. T o fac i l i ta te this, a key cross-donor e f fo r t was put in place through 
the creation o f a forma l fo rum fo r mu l t i-donor p lann ing and strategic coordination ca l led MERECE 
(Mesa Redonda de Donantes en Educacion). In parallel, the acceptance o f Honduras’ proposal fo r the 
achievement o f universal pr imary education by the Education Fo r A l l Fast Track In i t ia t ive (EFA-FTI) -- 
one o f on ly 7 proposals to be accepted wor ld-w ide -- has prov ided a concrete framework to test the ab i l i ty 
o f donors to wo rk together towards implementation o f a common goal. The current status o f the EFA 
process in Honduras i s described in some de ta i l in B o x C. The EFA in i t ia t ive w i l l be f u l l y integrated in to 
the PRSP progress report, wh ich i s currently under preparation. 

36. 
The second component o f the PRSP’s human capital p i l l a r concerns the p rov is ion o f better access 
to h igh-qua l i ty health services to the Honduran population, inc lud ing adequate coverage o f ru ra l 
dwellers. As previously discussed (para 15), Honduras has made important progress in expanding the 
coverage o f pub l ic health and basic services, but a number o f important challenges rema in wh ich w i l l 
require concerted e f for t over the medium- to long- term i f PRSP and MDG targets in health are to be met. 
Currently, the health sector i s characterized b y a high degree o f fragmentation between the public, pr iva te 
and social security sub-sectors, resulting in c r i t ica l inefficiencies and bottlenecks. Considerable 
differences exist between the packages o f services prov ided to the Secretaria de Salud ( S S ) popu la t ion 
and the Honduran Institute o f Social Security (IHSS) members. This fragmentation i s exacerbated by a 
weak regulatory framework that has no t developed the stewardship functions o f the SS related to po l icy 
malung, p lann ing and qua l i ty assurance. In addition, the ins t i tu t iona l capacity to imp lemen t and enforce 
regulations i s v ir tua l ly non-existent. Another key concern, relates to the l o w qua l i ty and p roduc t iv i ty o f 
health services, especially in ru ra l areas. A recent FH IS evaluation found that ru ra l health centers had in 
stock on ly 55 percent o f basic equipment items and on ly 43 percent o f the prescribed l is t o f 38 basic 
medicines in stock. 

37. 

In large measure, l o w qua l i ty and p roduc t iv i ty are closely l inked to human resource management 
issues. I t i s estimated that nearly US$4 m i l l i o n are los t each year due to high absenteeism and mu l t ip le 
employment - h igh l igh t ing the need fo r e f fec t ive c i v i l service reform. F ina l ly , the health sector has been 
fac ing severe f inanc ia l constraints in recent years. M o s t notably, the I H S S (wh ich covers about 15 
percent o f the population) has seen an erosion in rea l terms o f i t s revenues - and a consequent 
deterioration i n services --- due to a long-standing ce i l ing o f 600 Lempiras on pay ro l l contributions. This 
was par t ia l ly corrected in 2001 when the con tr ibu t ion ce i l ing was raised to 2,400 Lempiras w i t h further 
l im i ted increases approved to 2003. The I H S S now needs to ensure that these increased contributions are 
channeled to improved services and increased coverage, to he lp rebu i ld pub l ic confidence in, and demand 
for, i t s services. 

38. 

Against this background, the PRSP emphasizes three broad areas f o r fu ture investments and 
sector reforms. These include: (i) strengthening the stewardship func t ion o f the SS , inc lud ing pub l ic 
health and regulatory functions; (ii) imp rov ing resource allocation, and the f inanc ia l s tab i l i ty o f the SS 
and IHSS ; and (iii) increasing health services coverage, qua l i ty and e f f ic iency . In the latter area, the 
focus i s on ensuring the ava i lab i l i ty o f a basic package o f p r ima ry health services ( inc lud ing ensuring the 
ava i lab i l i ty o f necessary medicines and basic equipment) at a l l health facilities, and, in particular, on 
strengthening services fo r women and ch i ldren inc lud ing reproductive hea l th services and commun i ty- 
based heath and nu t r i t ion p romo t ion f o r ch i ldren . F ina l ly in v iew o f recent findings o f H I V / A I D S 
prevalence o f 1.6 percent in the adult Honduran popu la t ion - the highest prevalence in Cen tra l America, 
fo l low ing Be l ize-- Government i s now deve lop ing a p lan t o combat the disease in a comprehensive 
manner. The country has recently received a grant f r om the G loba l Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Ma lar ia , 
wh ich should he lp facilitate imp lemen ta t ion o f a na t iona l strategy. 

P i l l a r V: Strengthening Social Protection fo r Specific Groups 

39. 

The ove ra l l objective o f the PRSP’s fifth pillar i s t o imp rove the we l fa re o f popu la t ion 
groups l iv ing in vulnerable situations and pove r ty conditions, focus ing especially o n ch i ld ren and 
adolescents, the elderly, women, disabled persons and ethnic m ino r i t ies . A k e y aspect o f 
achieving this objective concerns ra t iona l iz ing the country’s array o f ex is t ing soc ia l safety ne t 
programs, w h i c h though e f fec t ive t o va ry ing degrees in terms o f the i r i n d i v i d u a l goals, do n o t 
co l lec t ive ly satisfactorily address the needs o f the most vulnerable groups. A recent assessment 
o f Honduras’ social safety net indicates that programs are f requen t ly dup l ica t ive and ove r lapp ing 
in assisting pa r t icu la r groups, w h i l e other - e q u a l l y needy - groups are v i r t u a l l y untouched by 
ex is t ing programs. F o r example, mu l t ip le programs touch o n the health, nu tr i t ion , early stimulation 

and education issues o f small ch i ldren - often in an uncoordinated way, using contradictory des igns . At 
the same time, l i t t le attention i s pa id to adolescents, disabled persons o r indigenous communities. In this 
context, a core strategic objective o f this pillar i s to reorient the ac t iv i t ies o f the Honduras two ma in safety 
net programs, the FHIS and the PR A F away f r om general development ac t iv i t ies (such as infrastructure 
development) -- wh ich should increasingly be taken on b y loca l authorities under the Government’s 
decentralization efforts -- and towards a more focused support fo r the iden t i f ied vulnerable groups. Some 
progress in this direction i s already apparent. Fo r example, the FH IS has begun to promote and support 
social assistance projects fo r specific vulnerable groups (at-risk ch i ldren and adolescents, the handicapped 
and the elderly). I t has also embarked on a ma jor e f for t to support A fro-Honduran and indigenous groups 
to develop their communities, in part through the Bank-supported “Nuestru Ruices” program. 

40. 
In add i t ion to imp rov ing the targeting and focus o f the country’s social safety net, the PRSP 
places high p r io r i ty w i th in this p i l la r on promo t ing gender equity and equality. Wh i le the Gender 
Development Index (GDI)5 has seen an improvement f r om 0.600 in 1998 to 0.633 in 2002 wh ich 
indicates progress towards gender equality, i t s t i l l on ly places Honduras at a rank o f 98 out o f 146 
countries measured, and i s on ly above Guatemala in Central America. W h i l e women’s participation in 
administrative, professional and technical posts i s s l igh t ly h igher than that o f men, their earnings amount 
to on ly about one-third the incomes o f men on average. In addition, women’s representation in po l i t ica l 
l i f e i s l ow - e.g., on ly 8.6 percent o f Congressional representatives are women. However, broad c i v i l 
society par t ic ipa t ion in the nom ina t ion o f Supreme Cour t judges has seen increased representation o f 
women on the bench, reaching 60 percent at the current time. Aga ins t this background, the PRSP calls 
fo r better enforcement o f women’s rights inc lud ing the L a w o f Equa l Oppor tun i ty fo r Women and 
systematic mainstreaming o f gender issues in development programs (e.g., land regularization and MSME 
development) to improve women’s economic inclusion. Some progress in these areas i s already apparent. 
In addition, an important a im i s to exp l ic i t ly incorporate gender equity concerns in the allocation o f pub l ic 
resources. Moreover, in v iew o f high incidence o f domestic violence against women in Honduras, the 
PRSP calls fo r rev is ion o f the L a w against Domestic V io lence and i t s s tr ic t enforcement. 

41. 

The last component o f the PRSP’s social protection p i l la r concerns imp rov ing the socio-economic 

status o f A f r o -H o n d u r a n a n d 10 ethn ic indigenous groups (7 percent o f the to ta l population) wh ich 

tend to be poorer than the general popu la t ion and are severely underserved b y pub l ic programs. Besides 
s tress ing the need to spec i f ica l ly address the needs o f these groups w i th in other PRSP pr ior i t ies 
(especially land regularization, health, education, SMSE development and safety nets), the PRSP also 
seeks to strengthen the right o f ethnic groups to self-development based on the ir ow n iden t i ty . T o he lp 
achieve this, the in ten t ion i s to put in place a Na t iona l E thn ic Counc i l w i t h the responsibility fo r

Pillar VI: Guaranteeing Sustainability 

42. 
Recognizing that the sustainability o f many (if no t all) o f the pr ior i t ies and programs discussed in 
the preceding f i v e p i l lars i s h igh ly dependent on a State where transparency, participation, justice, 
personal security and effective pub l ic management prevail, the last p i l la r o f Honduras’ PRSP emphasizes 
the need to s ign i f ican t ly improve the country’s governance structure and processes. I t also emphasizes 
another aspect o f sustainable grow th and poverty reduction - namely, the need to reverse the process o f 
environmental deterioration, reduce ecological vu lnerab i l i ty and mitigate the impact o f fu ture natural 
disasters on Honduras’ people and development advances. 

43. 
Imp rov ing governance and transparency in pub l ic management continues to be an extremely 
important p r io r i ty fo r Honduras’ development agenda. Shor t ly after taking office, 
the Madu ro 
administration renewed the mandate o f the Na t iona l An t i-Corrup t ion Counc i l (NAC) , under the 
leadership o f Card ina l Rodriguez. The NAC , wh ich i s comprised o f bo th government and c i v i l society 
representatives, i s now mov ing ahead w i th implementation o f the recommendations o f i t s an t i-corrup t ion 
strategy w i t h the full support o f the Administration. Several o f the actions recommended concern 
improvements to pub l ic sector accountability. These are described below. 

44. 
A key p r io r i ty iden t i f ied by government -- w i t h support f r om the IDB, the Bank, the EU and 
some b i la tera l donors - i s the strengthening o f systems fo r f inanc ia l management and pub l ic procurement, 
in l ine w i t h the recommendations o f N A C . In a pre l im inary move towards increasing pub l ic sector 
accountability, Government has recently taken steps to establish a strong O f f ice o f the Aud i to r General, 
through the merg ing o f the o f f ice o f the Comp tro l ler General and the Ethics O f f ice . I t has also secured 
approval o f a new State Procurement Law wh ich brings a l l Government agencies under a single set o f 
rules, provides f o r the establishment o f a new Procurement Regulatory O f f ice , mandates open compe t i t ive 
procedures fo r procurement ( inc lud ing some leve l ing o f the p lay ing f i e l d between international and loca l 
suppliers) and includes important disclosure provisions. However, considerable e f fo r t i s s t i l l needed to. 
e f fec t ive ly implement the provisions o f the new law, inc lud ing establishment o f the new na t iona l 
procurement o f f ice and e f fec t ive dissemination o f i t s prov is ions to the various government agencies, the 
pr iva te sector and the general pub l ic . Ac t ion plans to complete the organizational and ins t i tu t iona l 
framework fo r an improved procurement system are curren t ly be ing developed, in part w i t h assistance 
f r om the IDB under i t s Program o f E f f ic iency and Transparency i n Government Procurement. A full set 
o f recommendations fo r further implementation o f procurement improvements w i l l be inc luded in the 
Country Procurement Assessment Rev iew (CPAR) update, be ing prepared j o i n t l y b y the IDB and the 
Bank, and wh ich i s scheduled fo r completion b y mid-2003. 

45. 
In para l le l w i t h improvements to procurement, Government, w i t h Bank assistance, i s beg inn ing t o 
focus on upgrading and modern iz ing government f inanc ia l management systems, streamlining processes 
and procedures, and ra t iona l iz ing and strengthening ins t i tu t ions responsible fo r ensuring accountability. 
In this regard, Government i s keen ly aware o f the need to bo th update the lega l framework that governs 
f inanc ia l management as w e l l as to urgently upgrade human resources f o r f inanc ia l management 
throughout the pub l ic sector. Further detailed areas fo r ac t ion are be ing de f ined in the context o f the 
ongoing CFAA , wh ich i s be ing prepared b y the Bank w i t h the full cooperation o f the Honduran 
Government. The C F A A i s expected to be completed in June 2002 but pre l im inary f ind ings have already 
been discussed with, and endorsed by, Government. These are described in B o x D be low . 

46. 

F ina l ly , the active participation o f c i v i l society organizations (CSOs) in pub l ic l i f e i s an 
impor tan t factor con tr ibu t ing to strengthening governance in Honduras. A notable success has been the 
ro le o f CSOs in the selection o f new Supreme Cou r t justices (see para 47 below). Moreover, c i v i l society 
i s fa i r ly represented in the Consultative Counc i l fo r the PRS, where they are expected to shape the 
revisions to the PRSP and carry out social audit functions. Government, w i t h support f r om the Bank and 
a number o f other donors, i s exp lo r ing ways to ensure regular consultation w i t h CSOs in the mon i to r ing 
o f PRSP implementation inc lud ing the audit o f pub l ic expenditures and mon i to r ing o f pub l ic service 
delivery. The government also intends to seek ways to fur ther invo lve indigenous and A fro-Honduran 
communities in pub l ic decision making and in sharing the benefits o f economic growth. 

47. 
jud ic iary and the rule of 

The second ma jor component o f the PRSP’s Sustainability pillar invo lves strengthening o f the 
l aw , inc lud ing imp rov ing the personal security o f the Honduran population. 
The jud ic ia l system in Honduras has trad i t iona l ly been plagued b y ine f f ic iency , corruption, po l i t ica l 
patronage in appointments, weak human and f inanc ia l resources, archaic laws and administrative 
bottlenecks. Recognizing these shortcomings, the Madu ro administration has embarked upon a program 
to strengthen the ru le o f law, promo te jud ic ia l independence, improve j u d i c i a l system performance and 
strengthen the access to jus t ice o f disadvantaged popu la t ion groups. Consequently, reforms have recently 
been passed and implementation wo rk has already commenced. The f i r s t step in the process has been the 
enactment o f a constitutional amendment (in 2002) to enable the selection and appointment o f a new 
Supreme Cour t through a transparent process invo lv ing c i v i l society par t ic ipa t ion and open competition. 
The number o f justices was increased f r om n ine to 15 and the te rm o f o f f ice increased to seven years, thus 
greatly imp rov ing jud ic ia l independence. Since i t s appointment early last year, the new Supreme Cour t 
has taken the lead in imp rov ing the performance o f the Jud ic ia l Branch and has already implemented a 
proac t ive program to fight corrup t ion w i th in the jud ic iary , introduce ora l procedures in penal courts, 
develop tra in ing plans fo r staff and judges, and establish jus t ice o f the peace courts. 

48. 

In para l le l w i th jud ic ia l reforms, the Government has given h igh p r io r i ty to increasing the 
personal security o f Hondurans. Restoration o f public security was at the center o f the PN’s p la t fo rm 
during the last electoral campaign, in response to a sharp rise in cr ime and drugs-related gang violence in 
Honduras in recent years. Wh i le concrete data are lacking, there i s some evidence that, besides i t s severe 
human impact o n Honduran citizens, the h igh incidence o f cr ime may have been a key factor in the 
closure o f some muqu i lu (assembly fo r re-export) operations and i s acting as a brake on new investments 
in manufacturing and tourism. T o combat this trend towards increasing crime, the Government has 
embarked on a h igh ly-pub l ic ized “zero tolerance” campaign against crime, inc lud ing dep loy ing additional 
po l ice and security forces in urban areas and expanding their powers o f search, seizure and detention. 

49. 

The third ma jor component under P i l la r V I relates to modernization and decentralization o f 
public administration in Honduras. In this regard, the ma jor challenge fac ing the country i s c i v i l service 
reform. The central government employs around 110,000 people, or about 5 percent o f the to ta l labor 
force, w i th a wage b i l l that accounted fo r 10.7 percent o f GDP i n 2002. C iv i l service reform i s long 
overdue and c r i t ica l to modernising the pub l ic sector and de l ive r ing on the country’s poverty reduction 
strategy. Key deficiencies in the current system include: lack o f a coherent pub l ic sector wage po l icy ; 
po l i t ica l interference in recruitment and excessive staff turnover during changes in administration; high 
absenteeism and multiple employment; significant s k i l l s mismatch; and, lack o f performance evaluation 
systems. The c i v i l service re fo rm law currently be ing prepared fo r presentation to Congress w i l l address 
many o f the shortcomings iden t i f ied . However, implementation w i l l probab ly be a d i f f icu l t process 
requ ir ing sustained commitment and widespread popular support. 

50. 

Another aspect o f pub l ic sector modernization emphasized in the PRSP concerns more rap id 
progress towards decentralization. To further this end, the PRSP calls fo r creation o f a single agency - 
the M in is t ry o f Governance and Justice - to serve as the norma t ive en t i ty f o r the coordination and 
regulation o f the mun ic ipa l sector and to support the development o f loca l governments and communities. 
I t also seeks to strengthen the ro le o f loca l governments as development p romo t ion agencies, inter alia, 
by re form ing the L a w o f Mun ic ipa l i t ies , transferring respons ib i l i ty f o r the management o f natural 
resources, developing ins t i tu t iona l capacities fo r p lann ing and evaluation, establishing clear guidelines fo r 
partnerships w i t h the private sector ( for service provision) and w i t h c i v i l society ( fo r program mon i tor ing) 
and mov ing fo rwa rd w i t h fulfilling lega l requirements fo r revenue transfers t o loca l governments w i th in 
the constraints imposed b y the need to maintain a stable macro-economic framework . Thus far progress 
on decentralization has been re la t ive ly slow in Honduras, in part re f lec t ing po l i t ica l d i f f icu l t ies mentioned 
at the outset o f this report (para 1). The Government i s deve lop ing a strategy to “reformulate social 
po l icy ” focusing on decentralizing responsibility fo r the p rov is ion o f selected social services to the loca l 
level, focusing in i t ia l ly on the 80 poorest mun ic ipa l i t ies and 7 cities. This in i t ia t ive is , however, s t i l l in 
the early stages and i ts future i s s t i l l unclear. 

51. 

F ina l ly , Pillar V I emphasizes the need fo r much greater attention t o environmental issues as a 
core element in increasing the sustainability o f Honduras’ pover ty reduc t ion strategy. Honduras’ 
topographical features, predominantly mountainous w i t h narrow coastal p la ins and numerous inland 
valleys, make sustainable environmental management d i f f icu l t . High popu la t ion growth, skewed land 
ownership, con f l ic t ive 
tenure and usu fruc t situations in pub l ic forest lands, inappropriate land 
management and forestry po l ic ies have been responsible fo r the conversion o f large areas o f forest fo r 
activities o f dubious economic value and the depletion o f coastal and marine resources. A clear effect has 
been the loss o f the environmental services prov ided b y the forested uplands and the lowland, trop ica l 
forests -- degradation o f water qua l i ty and o f so i l resources, increased vu lnerab i l i ty to natural disasters, 
and the loss o f biodiversity. 
Inappropriate land use and human settlement patterns have adversely 
impacted watersheds and accentuated the coun try ’s vu lnerab i l i ty t o na tura l disasters such as Hurricane 
M i tch . 

52. 
Honduras has diverse ecosystems, w i th rich f lo ra and fauna, par t icu lar ly in i t s humid t rop ica l and 
subtropical forests. The Honduran National System o f Protected Areas (SLNAPH) has 107 protected 
areas wh ich represent about 45 percent o f forest areas. However, the current po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l 
framework does no t a l low effective enforcement o f environmental laws and regulations. In addition, due 
to l im i ted f inanc ia l resources, only one quarter o f the protected areas are actually serviced, many are no t 
adequately demarcated and penalties for misuse are inadequately enforced. 
Imp rov ing Honduras’s 
environmental management w i l l mean addressing a number o f key institutional challenges. Prominent 
among these are: (i) the legal de f in i t ion and security o f property ownership and r igh ts to invest in and 
benefit 
f rom forests and land; (ii) re fo rm o f the current pub l ic forest ins t i tu t ion and strengthening o f the 
lead environmental institutions, decentralization o f environmental management, and development o f 
c lear ly defined strategies for protected areas and land use; (iii) implementation o f programs to encourage 
commun i ty par t ic ipa t ion and empowerment; ( iv) establishment o f a framework o f rights, responsibilities 
and subsequently, clear incentives fo r environmental management; (v) integration o f environmental 
management concerns in to sectoral and development planning; and (v i) development o f reg iona l ly- 
integrated environmental management strategies. Many o f these are already addressed under other p i l lars 
o f the poverty reduction strategy, especially Pillar 11 (reducing ru ra l poverty). F ina l ly , i t should be noted 
that since 2001, Government, has required the conduct o f environmental impac t assessment fo r a l l 
infrastructural investments bo th public and private. The Government i s now in the process o f transferring 
responsibility f o r the conduct and rev iew o f these impact assessments to loca l authorities, while, in 
parallel, strengthening loca l capacitating. 

53. 
F ina l ly , i t i s necessary to continue to strengthen Honduras’s capacity fo r management of natura l 
disasters. Hurr icane M i t c h exposed weaknesses in the des ign and construction qua l i ty o f pub l ic works; 
urban planning and emergency response capacity. 
The government’s p lan fo r environmental 
sustainability and disaster m i t iga t ion i s focused on po l ic ies and programs to: (i) create an appropriate 
lega l and ins t i tu t iona l framework and ensure full compliance w i t h the law - D ra f t Laws pending 
legislative approval include Land-Use Planning, Water, Forestry and one f o r the establishment o f a 
Na t iona l System f o r R isk Reduction and Emergency Planning; (ii) decentralize responsibility fo r 
environmental management to loca l governments; (iii) improve and make more transparent procedures fo r 
environmental impac t assessments and licensing; ( iv) apply f inanc ia l and economic instruments to 
promote conservation and sustainable use o f natural resources; (v) imp lemen t a national b iod ivers i ty 
action plan, and; (v i ) promote active commun i ty and c i v i l society par t ic ipa t ion i n environmental 
protection and risk-management activities, especially in areas w i t h the most vulnerable sub-populations. 
M a n y o f these issues have begun to be addressed, in part w i t h assistance f r om a Bank-financed project. 

111. THE WORLD BANK GROW’S PARTNERSHIP W I TH HONDURAS 

T h e Last CAS: Impact and Lessons 

54. 
The previous CAS was discussed by the Board o f Execu t ive D irec tors in February 2000. 
Developed in the aftermath o f Hurr icane M i t c h (late 1998) , the overa l l thrust o f the last CAS was to help 
Honduras rebuild, wh i le lay ing the basis fo r a stronger economy and a more equitable d is tr ibu t ion o f 
growth. W i t h regard to the longer-term re fo rm agenda, the ove r r id ing p r io r i ty o f the CAS was t o assist 
the Government to develop, adopt and implement an outcome-based pover ty reduction strategy, w i t h a 
strong emphasis on imp rov ing social service provision, strengthening the safety net, fostering indigenous 
and A fro-Honduran people’s development, mainstreaming gender and supporting sustainable ru ra l 
development. The strategy supported faster growth, as an essential complement to poverty reduction, 
through infrastructure rehabilitation, strengthening the f inanc ia l system and pr iva te sector development. 
I t also sought to ensure sustained progress v ia a focus on macro-economic stability, ins t i tu t ion building,

governance improvements and improved environmental management and disaster-preparedness. The 
CAS base case lend ing scenario amounted to US$3 17 m i l l ion , re f lec t ing an extraordinary increase to 
support Government’s pos t-M i tch reconstruction program. 

I D A Experience 

55. 
What wo rked we l l . The last CAS iden t i f ied six cr i ter ia fo r judging the success o f the Bank’s 
assistance over FYs00-02: (i) developing and imp lemen t ing an outcome-based pover ty reduction strategy; 
(ii) imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f social services; (iii) strengthening the social safety net; ( iv) imp rov ing 
indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples’ development; 
(v) mainstreaming gender as a po l icy 
consideration; and (v i) supporting ru ra l development. 
In broad terms, performance on a l l o f these 
measures was satisfactory. Mos t notably, the PRSP was completed in 2001, and i s now central to the 
country’s development agenda. Bank assistance has also been instrumental in strengthening statistical 
capacity and poverty mon i tor ing ( inc lud ing imp roved disaggregation o f data b y race, e thn ic i ty and 
gender) d r iv ing the reorientation o f the government’s social po l icy agenda. 
Impor tan t advances .were 
made in education v ia the PROHECO program, wh ich expanded coverage and improved qua l i ty through 
the establishment o f 1,250 community-managed schools and b i l ingua l education. Social safety nets were 
strengthened, par t icu lar ly the FH IS wh ich i s now well-established and, b y and large, wo rk ing e f fec t ive ly 
in poor communities, including special emphases on women, and A fro-Honduran and indigenous groups. 
The ru ra l development agenda also moved fo rwa rd w i t h s ign i f ican t improvements occurr ing (through the 
Ru ra l Land Management Project) in land regularization, strengthening invo lvemen t o f and p rov id ing 
benefits to forest dwe l l ing communities through management o f pub l ic forests, development o f pr iva t ized 
technical service prov is ion to households o f ru ra l poor in pub l ic forest lands, and a successful “Access T o 
Land P i lo t ” project to prov ide the poor w i t h land v ia pr iva te financing. Progress on gender 
mainstreaming has also occurred w i t h a recognized “Best Practice” approach to gender in p rov is ion o f 
extension services through the Ru ra l Land Management Pro jec t and improved health care fo r women at 
p r ima ry care centers as we l l as a number o f ac t iv i t ies targeted t o women under the FHIS. 

56. 
The Bank was also able to prov ide t ime ly and e f fec t ive support t o pos t-M i tch reconstruction 
efforts. A Fast-Track Hurr icane Emergency Pro jec t fo r US$200 m i l l i o n was approved to p rov ide balance 
o f payments support fo r f inanc ing c r i t ica l impor ts during the immediate reconstruction phase. T h i s 
operation was recently reviewed b y O ED and found to have been satisfactory in i t s overa l l design and 
impact. In addition, the Bank restructured f i v e ongo ing operations w i th in ex is t ing cred i t amounts that 
financed about US$75 m i l l i o n o f hurricane-related expenditures. 
I n addition, 
f ive supplemental 
operations were approved to p rov ide the add i t iona l funding needed to accomplish project objectives after 
the hurr icane . At the request o f several donor countries, the Bank established, and i s s t i l l administering, 
the Central American Emergency Trust Fund (CAETF) t o wh ich donor contributions were made to 
support Honduras (and other hurricane-affected countries) in cover ing mu l t i la tera l debt service payments. 
T o date about US$115 m i l l i o n has been pa id to Honduras’ mu l t i la tera l creditors on i t s beha l f v ia the 
CAETF . The effective implementation o f reconstruction programs b y government and c i v i l society 
enabled Honduras to complete most reconstruction tasks b y the end o f 2001. Honduras has also begun (in 
par t w i th Bank assistance) to strengthen i t s disaster m i t iga t ion capabilities through strengthening national 
and loca l leve l capacity fo r disaster preven t ion ( inc lud ing ear ly warnings and land use planning) and the 
establishment o f disaster vu lnerab i l i ty programs in mun ic ipa l i t ies most vulnerable to natural disasters. 

57. 
Budgetary support f r om the Bank and other donors and sound macroeconomic management in the 
i n i t i a l CAS per iod led to a resumption o f g row th in 2000 and 2001 (real GDP grew by 5.7 and 2.6 percent 
respectively). Enhanced H IPC debt re l ie f came one step closer to f ru i t ion when Honduras achieved the 
Dec is ion Point in July 2000. During the pe r iod 2000-2002, Honduras received US$168.9 m i l l i o n o f 
in te r im debt re l ie f . Unfortunately, as prev ious ly discussed, lax f isca l management during 200 1, an 
election year, and a deteriorating external environment at the end o f the same year, led to the derailment 

o f the macro-framework, s ta l l ing the on-going PRGF program w i t h the IMF and s ign i f ican t ly de lay ing 
achievement o f the H IPC Completion Point. However, impor tan t improvements occurred on the 
governance fron t including the forma t ion o f the Na t iona l An t i -Co r rup t ion Counc i l w i th c i v i l society 
participation, the establishment o f the O f f ice o f the Aud i tor General and the significant reforms o f the 
jud ic ia l system referred to earlier (paras 43 and 47). 

58. 

What went poorly. As noted above, macroeconomic management weakened s ign i f ican t ly in the 
last year o f the previous CAS, large ly due to the ba l loon ing pub l ic sector wage bill. Progress toward 
structural reforms was also mixed. G iven the government’s preoccupation w i t h the reconstruction agenda 
and the narrow w indow o f opportunity fo r deep structural re fo rm (due to l o n g electoral campaign 
periods), Honduras made l i t t l e progress in imp lemen t ing i t s ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm agenda -- inc lud ing 
pub l ic sector modernization, c i v i l service re fo rm and decentralization. A marked fa i lure was in the 
financial sector where early warnings ( inc lud ing tw o bank failures) o f sector weaknesses were large ly 
ignored. S im i lar ly , insu f f ic ien t emphasis was g iven to imp rov ing the business c l ima te and fac i l i ta t ing 
pr iva te sector growth, including expanding the ro le o f the pr iva te sector in the prov is ion o f pub l ic 
services. Other areas where structural re fo rm measures were stalled as a result o f po l i t ica l opposition 
inc lude forestry and water, as discussed in Section I1 above. 

59 . 
T o a large extent, the above failures re f lec t the problems encountered b y successive Honduran 
Governments in generating a strong national consensus around the exigencies o f sound macroeconomic 
management and the benefits o f structural reform. In many instances, progress on re fo rm has stalled due 
to popular opposition, despite strong commitment b y senior decision-makers in Government. This, in 
turn, suggests the need fo r sustained e f fo r t to develop a continuous dialogue w i t h c i v i l society and key 
sectoral stakeholders on development issues, p r io r to the launching o f new in i t ia t ives . In this regard, the 
consultation process surrounding the PRSP and the PRSP Progress Report have fo r the f i r s t t ime prov ided 
a fo rum fo r consultation w i th c i v i l society leaders, the pr iva te sector, the catholic church and other 
stakeholders on the country’s development vision, re fo rm agenda and program implementation. This 
consultation system has recently been forma l ized v ia the creation o f permanent mechanism -- the Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Consultative Counc i l - to ma in ta in continuous dialogue w i t h c i v i l society, other key 
stakeholders and the donor commun i ty on the implementation o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy. The 
challenge fo r the Government over this CAS pe r iod i s to e f fec t ive ly engage w i t h the Counc i l on the 
content, design and implementation o f development programs and structural reforms. This should go a 
long way towards ensuring smoother progress on the re fo rm program and the sustainability o f po l icy and 
structural changes. 

60. 

Portfolio Performance. The Honduras po r t fo l io , at the t ime o f the last CAS , had eleven projects 
under implementation. Since then, eight new projects were approved and a s i m i l a r number closed6. As o f 
Ma rch 31, 2003, the po r t fo l io contained eleven projects fo r a to ta l comm i tmen t o f US$293 m i l l ion , o f 
wh ich U S $ l 8 5 m i l l i o n remain undisbursed. The Honduras po r t fo l io i s re la t ive ly young, w i t h an average 
implementation per iod o f on ly 2.3 years in FY02 . Despite sporadic imp lemen ta t ion delays, a l l active 
projects are currently rated satisfactory bo th in terms o f ach iev ing the ir Development Objectives and 
Implementation Progress. Table 5 be low provides an overv iew o f po r t fo l io performance. 

O f the eight projects closed, two were rated unsatisfactory in the achievement o f development outcomes b y OED. 
However, in one o f these cases, the project had been restructured to respond to the Hurricane M i t c h emergency. As 
acknowledged by OED the project had performed f u l l y satisfactorily w i t h respect t o the reprogrammed activities. 
However, a formal “unsatisfactory” ra t ing had to be g iven to the project, since reprogramming meant that 
the 
project’s original objectives had no t been met by the t ime o f completion.

Summary of Lessons from Recent Portfolio Performance. The last fo rma l Country Po r t fo l io 
Performance Rev iew took place in April 2000 - however the current administration has set up the 
Executive O f f ice fo r Project Mon i to r ing (OPSP) in the Presidency to he lp resolve emerging pro jec t issues 
on an ongo ing basis. A number o f issues and lessons were drawn through care fu l mon i tor ing o f the 
por t fo l io , consultations w i th Task Team Leaders and a recent Po r t fo l io Rev iew Mee t ing w i t h pro jec t 
managers o f ongoing Bank projects and senior government o f f ic ia ls . This consultative process has helped 
to shape this CAS, and w i l l be considered in future pro jec t design. K e y lessons learned include: 

F inanc ia l management and procurement: F inanc ia l management and procurement expertise i s weak 
wh ich 
in some cases affects project 
implementation. Sharing experiences among Project 
Implementation Units (PIUs) and tra in ing o f procurement personnel should be considered key 
elements o f pro jec t development to avo id implementation delays i n the future. Moreover, the Bank 
and IDB v ia the CPAR and C F A A and their fo l low -up are wo rk ing w i t h Honduras to s ign i f ican t ly 
strengthen the country’s capacities in these areas. 

Participation o f stakeholders: Inadequate par t ic ipa t ion o f stakeholders in project development can 
impede project ownership and the longer-term sustainability o f po l icy re fo rm and investments. T o 
address this issue , the Bank intends to: (i) s ign i f ican t ly enhance consultations and consensus-building 
efforts w i t h key stakeholders (e.g. central and loca l government, c i v i l society, and donors) in the 
design and throughout implementation o f new and ex is t ing operations; and (ii) actively support, 
through advice and technical assistance, the e f fec t ive func t ion ing o f the Pover ty Reduction Strategy 
Consultative Council, wh ich i s a prom is ing fo rum fo r the generation o f consensus on po l icy reforms 
and program implementation strategies. 

External assistance coordination: T h e demands o f multiple, ring-fenced assistance operations supported 
by different development partners have greatly stretched Honduras’ l im i ted capacity fo r po l icy 
formulation and p rog radp ro jec t implementation. 
Improved coordination w i t h donors ( inc lud ing v ia 
new lending modalities such as SWAPS and programmatic lending) i s therefore, a h igh p r io r i ty . 
Moreover, w i th the Bank’s IDA resource envelope decreasing f r om i t s peak in the pos t-M i tch era, 
program selectivity and effective coordination w i th other development partners w i l l assume even more 
importance in the e f for t to assist Government in achieving PRSP objectives. 

IFC and M IGA E xp e r i en c e 

62. 

ZFC. In the previous CAS period, IFC ’s pr ior i t ies included: (i) assisting Honduras in extending 
private participation in infrastructure; (ii) strengthening the f inanc ia l sector and broadening access to 
capital; (iii) he lp ing to improve the enabling environment fo r the pr iva te sector in Honduras; and ( iv) 
selectively p rov id ing d irec t f inanc ing in industry, services, and agribusiness. G iven Honduras’ weak 
business environment during the pe r iod and consequent l im i ta t ions o n viable f inanc ing opportunities, I F C 
focused on p rov id ing a m i x o f investment and non-investment ac t iv i t ies aimed at the above p r io r i ty areas 

at bo th country and regional levels. Some lessons o f IFC ’s experience during this pe r iod included: (i) the 
reg iona l approach increased investment opportunities fo r I F C in Central Amer ica due to economies o f 
scale; and (ii) many small- and medium-sized enterprises need capacity-building p r io r to accessing 
financing. 

63. 
In the f inanc ia l sector, IFC has recently been invo lved in three regional projects fo r a comm i t ted 
to ta l o f US$48.7 m i l l ion . These projects, in the Central Amer ica G row th Fund (a pr iva te equity fund), 
Cuscatlan (a regional financial group), and T U C A (a credit bureau company), a im to help strengthen 
Central America’s financial sector by imp rov ing access to capital fo r competitive f i r m s and strengthening 
asset qua l i ty management practices. 

64. 
To help improve the enabling environment in Honduras, F I A S , j o i n t l y w i t h IDA, studied the 
business environment fo r foreign direct investment, assisting in setting a strategic re fo rm agenda. The 
study, wh ich was released in M a y 2001, identified f ive areas fo r improvement (deregulation; lega l 
system; economic opening fo r increased competition; pr iva t iza t ion o f infrastructure; and education) to 
be t ter attract fore ign investment and recommended strengthened collaboration between the pub l ic and 
pr iva te sectors in the process o f mov ing forward. 

65. 
In infrastructure, IFC has been in discussions since 1998-99 o n po ten t ia l advisory wo rk on the 
pr iva t iza t ion o f a d is tr ibu t ion arm o f the ENEE (Empresa Nac iona l de Energia Electrica), a Honduran 
power u t i l i ty , w i t h a v iew to increasing pr iva te par t ic ipa t ion in the sector. The pr iva t iza t ion program was 
stalled under the previous administration as the proposed E lec tr ic i ty L a w was no t approved. The Madu ro 
administration however aims at re-launching power sector reform, inc lud ing unbundling o f the ENEE and 
subsequent pr iva t iza t ion o f a couple o f the resultant (distribution) companies. In this context, the Madu ro 
Government has requested I FC to move ahead on i t s advisory wo rk w i t h respect to the pr iva t iza t ion 
program and the ac t iv i ty i s expected be launched shortly. 

66. 
In Central Amer ica I F C also rev iewed a few projects in support o f pr iva te par t ic ipa t ion in 
infrastructure, wh ich l e d to investments in two reg iona l projects in power and in fo rma t ion technology f o r 
a to ta l amount o f US$23 m i l l ion . The results o f these investments have thus far been uneven, due to the 
nascent and fragmented nature o f the infrastructure sector in the Central Amer ican region, par t icu lar ly in 
terms o f pr iva te participation. 
In Honduras, IFC also considered f inanc ing fo r an airport concession 
project and undertook due diligence studies. I t did no t proceed, however, because o f an added investment 
requirement under the concession that made the pro jec t unbankable on commerc ia l terms. 

67. 
F ina l ly , du r ing the last CAS period, I F C p rov ided technical assistance (TA) supported b y several 
t r u s t funds, wh ich complement IFC ’s investment operation. O n the country level, TA was p rov ided to 
assist in privatization, modernization and expansion o f HondTe l , a state-owned telephone network, and in 
d ra f t ing o f a new legislative framework f o r insurance. On the reg iona l leve l in Cen tra l America, IFC’s 
projects cover ing Honduras included: an insurance market and investment assessment; S M E development 
efforts; a pr iva te health and education development in i t ia t ive ; and a study on a possible insurance scheme 
against natural disasters. The SME and health and education projects covered Honduras, Guatemala, 
Nicaragua and El Salvador, the countries hit b y the Hurr icane M i tch . 

68. 
As o f April 2003, IFC’s outstanding portfolio in Honduras stood at a to ta l o f US$26 m i l l i o n 
including US$5 m i l l i o n fo r participant’s account, w i t h three companies in agribusiness, power, and 
tourism. 

69. 
MZGA. MIGA’s experience i n Honduras up until the present has been consistent w i t h the pr iva te 
sector development strategy fo r the country and has centered on fac i l i ta t ing pr iva te sector par t ic ipa t ion in 
infrastructure, par t icu lar ly in the energy sector. Ip this regard, MIGA has issued six contracts o f 
guarantee, wh ich mob i l ized US$7 1.2 m i l l i o n o f investments in the power sector. Three o f these contracts 

are currently outstanding, accounting fo r an exposure o f US$11.3 m i l l ion , none o f wh ich i s reinsured. 
This exposure accounts fo r 0.22 percent o f MIGA’s overa l l gross po r t fo l io and 0.36 percent o f MIGA’s 
po r t fo l io ne t o f reinsurance. The existing pipeline o f projects in Honduras includes applications fo r 
coverage in the infrastructure sector -- continuing interest in the powe r sector, and a waste treatment 
project - and interest has also been expressed in the f inanc ia l sector. MIGA has on ly begun to prov ide 
technical assistance to Honduras and in this regard cannot prov ide any experience-related comments on 
sector targeting or investment promo t ion initiatives generally.

Sources of External Assistance. Aid assistance f r om the international donor commun i ty plays a 
cruc ia l ro le in supporting the implementation o f Honduras’ PRSP. The volume o f a id approved fo r 
Honduras over the past 5 o r so years exceeds US$2.3 b i l l i o n (almost one-third o f GDP) and consists o f 
357 operations under implementation. As this suggests, the Bank Group’s program o f assistance i s on ly a 
part o f a complex mosaic o f externally-assisted programs supported b y a large number o f development 
partners (Table 6). The Bank has been the second largest lender to Honduras, a f t e r the ZDB, wh ich 
accounts fo r about 27 percent o f a id operations currently under implementation. 
IDB’s po r t fo l io in 
execution consists o f 34 projects and 74 technical cooperation ac t iv i t ies fo r an amount o f US$621 m i l l ion . 
Annua l disbursements in the per iod 2000-2002 have averaged about US$77 m i l l i o n and disbursements fo r 
2003-2005 are projected at about US$85 m i l l i o n annually. In November 2002, IDB presented i t s Coun try 
Strategy fo r the four year per iod 2002-2005 w i t h a base case lend ing program o f US$460 m i l l i o n 
consisting o f 20 projects. O f this amount, about US$125 m i l l i o n wou ld be prov ided as programmatic 
budgetary support loans fo r poverty reduction and f inanc ia l sector strengthening - these operations w i l l 
be closely coordinated w i t h the Bank’s proposed adjustment operations under this CAS . 
investment operations are l i s t e d in Table 6. The IDB also p lays an impor tan t ro le in assisting 
Government w i t h the organizing and cha ir ing o f the Consultative G roup process. Fo l low ing IDB and the 
Bank, the EU i s Honduras’ third largest mu l t i la tera l partner, w i t h about 18 operations under 
implementation fo r an amount o f U S $ l 5 0 m i l l ion , o f wh ich about US$lOO m i l l i o n i s currently available. 
A memorandum o f understanding was signed w i t h the Government in M a r c h 2001 fo r an a id package o f 
147 m i l l i o n Euro fo r the per iod 2000-2006. The EU’s Country Strategy f o r 2002-2006 continues to 
emphasize support fo r strengthening loca l government and development; secondary education, and the 
sustainable management o f natural resources. 

IDB’s 

71. 
Among b i la tera l partners, USAZD i s the largest, w i t h a po r t fo l io o f 18 programs under 
implementation fo r an amount o f about US$320 m i l l ion , o f wh ich about US$119 m i l l i o n i s s t i l l available. 
M o r e than ha l f o f these resources are fo r programs fo r potable water supply, fam i ly health and food aid. 
Other areas include: economic po l icy re fo rm and produc t iv i ty ; voca t iona l education; protected areas, 
watershed and forests; and democracy building. Fu ture programmed support includes strengthening 
secondary cities, trade diversification, education, health and governance. Honduras has also been 
iden t i f ied as a potential recipient fo r resources f r om the U S Government’s M i l lenn ium Challenge 
Account. Japan i s the next largest b i la tera l donor w i t h a po r t fo l io o f 17 programs fo r an amount o f 
U S $ l l 6 m i l l ion , o f wh ich about US$38 m i l l i o n remains to be disbursed. Japan’s support covers: pover ty 
reduction; education; infrastructure, agriculture; health and sanitation, and; housing. Spain’s assistance 
amounts to about US$lOO m i l l ion , o f wh ich about US$67 i s curren t ly un-disbursed, for programs in 
education, housing, water and sanitation, loca l government development, jud ic iary , democracy building 
and environment. Other active donors inc lude I t a l y (US$68 m i l l ion) , Germany (US$50 m i l l ion) , Canada 
($43 m i l l ion) , Taiwan (US$36 m i l l ion ) , Sweden (US$19 m i l l ion) , Netherlands (US$13 m i l l ion ) and the 
Un i ted K ingdom (US$9 m i l l ion ) . Canadian assistance through C I D A i s be ing implemented through i t s 
strategy fo r 2002-2008 known as ProMesas wh ich w i l l support PRSP imp lemen ta t ion in f i v e key areas, 
namely: education, health, water and sanitation, forestry and ru ra l development. Support w i l l also be 
prov ided fo r cross-cutting themes such as equity, gender, decentralization and governance.

and Spain have about US$57 m i l l ion available for road and bridge rehabilitation. M u c h o f the investment in 
the transport sector i s to repair the damage caused by Hurricane M i tch . Water and sanitation has about 
US$121 m i l l ion available o f wh ich about 82 percent comes f r om the EU, the IDB and I ta ly w i th an 
additional 14 percent f rom Japan and Canada. The EU has an operation to repair and upgrade the water 
systems in f ive municipalities and the IDB has operations in 21 communities. Other sectors w i t h large 
donor programs include agriculture and forestry, urban development and housing, governance and 
modernization o f the state, education, energy and environmental protection. 

73. 
Aid Coordination. With over US$1 b i l l i o n available in external assistance to Honduras, a id 
coordination and accelerated implementation o f donor-assisted operations i s a major concern fo r the 
country. This i s especially true in l igh t o f Honduras’ generally weak ins t i tu t iona l capacity and l im i ted 
human resource base fo r project management. E f fo r ts are be ing made b y the Government to take a more 
prom inen t leadership ro le in a id coordination w i t h better iden t i f ica t ion and ar t icu la t ion o f a id requests and 
improvements in pub l ic f inanc ia l management and oversight mechanisms to facilitate the eventual 
adoption o f sector wide approaches by donors. As noted earlier, a key step has been the preparation o f 
the PRSP, wh ich has prov ided a framework fo r donors t o coalesce around country-owned pr ior i t ies . 
Moreover, Government has established seven roundtables f o r a id coord ina t ion around specific sectoral 
themes to ensure regular exchange o f in forma t ion and improved coord ina t ion o f activities. Some external 
assistance partners are making dramatic ins t i tu t iona l changes t o enable this new way o f wo rk ing (e.g., 
C I D A has recently decided to f u l l y decentralize funding approvals), wh i le many others have changed the 
way ex is t ing po l ic ies are implemented in the country. In add i t ion to the thematic roundtables, a key step 
has been the establishment o f the Executive O f f ice fo r Project Mon i to r ing under the Presidency to 
unb lock project implementation bottlenecks and accelerate the achievement o f results on the ground. 

74. 
In addition, Government has been negotiating w i t h donors to restructure a number o f ex is t ing 
operations to ensure greater coherence between the programs themselves, as w e l l as w i t h the pr ior i t ies 
l a i d out in the PRSP. There i s also a healthy trend towards d iv is ion o f labor amongst external assistance 
agencies w i t h lead responsibility fo r dialogue in ind iv idua l sectors be ing shared according to comparative 
advantages and greater willingness to co-finance operations l e d b y other donors. Fo r example, the Bank 
i s taking the lead on land administration wh i le the IDB w i l l progressively take over leadership on forestry 
sector dialogue. 
In Education, the Bank has been focus ing o n pr imary education wh i le the IDB has 
concentrated on secondary and technical education. Other areas o f BanW IDB cooperation include the 
PRSC, j u d i c i a l re fo rm , f i n a n c i a l sector, water, t ranspo r t a n d hea l th . The Bank and the IDB have 
fielded jo in t missions to carry out the C F A A and CPAR exercises and coordinated the formu la t ion o f 
their respective CASes. Broader coordination among ex terna l partners especially w i th respect to the 
f iduc iary requirements fo r externally supported programs/projects i s underway. An important step was 
the implementation in Honduras o f a workshop on a id harmon iza t ion in M a r c h 2003. The use o f 
harmonized repor t ing and f iduc iary arrangements w i l l be p i lo ted under the EFA program. 

Ob jec t ives o f Bank Group Assistance and C A S D e v e l o pm e n t Process 

75. 

The Bank Group’s assistance over the three and a ha l f-year pe r iod covered by this CAS (Fys03 - 
06) w i l l support Honduras’ e f for ts to implement i t s pover ty reduc t ion strategy as la id out in the PRSP and 

summarized in the preceding section o f this report. The core goal i s to support Honduran e f for ts to shift 
to a sustainable and inc lus ive higher-growth trajectory as a p r inc ipa l means o f reducing poverty and 
inequa l i ty in l ine w i t h PRSP and MDG targets. Within this broad objective, and taking in to account the 
Bank’s comparative advantages as we l l as the activities o f the Government and other development 
partners, the ma in emphases o f the Bank’s lend ing and knowledge services to Honduras are three-fold: (i) 
to increase produc t ive economic opportunities by he lp ing to address structural and ins t i tu t iona l barriers to 
economic g row th and broad-based participation in growth; (ii) to continue to invest in human capital and 
the pro tec t ion o f vulnerable groups; and (iii) to support the transparent and responsive func t ion ing o f 
the pub l ic sector. IFC ’s assistance to Honduras over the CAS per iod w i l l be f u l l y a l igned w i t h the f i r s t o f 
these objectives. 
I t s pr ior i t ies w i l l include supporting grow th o f export-oriented SMEs, supporting 
internationally-competitive firms w i th inadequate capital access, helping to strengthen the business 
environment and supporting the f inanc ia l sector. 

76. 
The above objectives and the Bank’s country assistance strategy (discussed below) were 
developed v ia a process o f consultation w i th the Honduran Government and Congress, c i v i l society, think- 
tanks, private sector stakeholders, the media and the international development community represented in 
Honduras. 
Consultations on the CAS were conducted in two stages. 
An early, in forma l round o f 
consultations was he ld in November 2002, invo lv ing a series a meetings w i t h separate groups o f 
stakeholders aimed at so l ic i t ing views on p r io r i ty areas for Bank involvement in Honduras. These early 
meetings generated a number o f suggestions for the Bank‘s strategic directions wh ich were incorporated in a 
draft program o f country assistance prepared during the f i r s t quarter o f 2003. In April 2003, a second, more 
formal round o f consultations was held w i th stakeholders in Honduras centered around a power-point 
presentation o f proposed areas o f emphasis and the draft program o f lend ing and non-lending activities in 
support o f Honduras’ PRSP. As a result o f these consultations, a number o f important shifts were made in 
the proposed program inc lud ing a greater emphasis on forestry, substitution o f a proposed urban water 
activity b y a broader urban services and urban violence operation, and the inc lus ion o f additional activities 
targeted to vulnerable groups, inc lud ing youth at risk and indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities. 
Annex E provides further in forma t ion on the CAS consultation process. 

The B a n k Group’s Assistance P rog ram in Honduras 

77. 
As indicated in para 75, the Bank Group’s support to Honduras over the FY03 -06 per iod i s f u l l y 
aligned w i t h the six pillars o f Honduras’ PRSP. The specific objectives l is ted f o r this CAS and areas to 
be supported under the wide-ranging PRSP umbre l la were care fu l ly coordinated w i t h the ongoing and 
planned assistance f r om other external partners, t o ensure program impac t and m i n i m i z e pressure on the 
country’s implementation capacity. In this regard, starting f r om a po r t fo l io and recent lending program 
dominated by investment projects, this CAS contemplates a moderate increase in programmatic lend ing 
(including quick-disbursing budgetary support and sector-wide approaches) to a l low fo r better alignment 
w i t h Government’s own implementation processes and procedures and an increased emphasis on 
outcomes. A number o f development partners have expressed the ir interest in collaborating w i t h the 
Bank in the design and implementation o f these programmatic approaches, imp ly ing , too, that these cou ld 
prove to be useful vehicles fo r fur ther ing the country’s a id coord ina t ion agenda. At the same time, g iven 
a continued need to strengthen institutionalltechnical capacity and pub l ic resource management, the CAS 
maintains a substantial program o f investment operations alongside the (new) programmatic approaches. 
F ina l ly , in a departure f r om past practice, this CAS includes a number o f reg iona l o r sub-regional 
activities cover ing Honduras and i t s neighbors, whose a im i s to exp lo i t commonalities, share experience 
and promote regional integration. The approach i s also expected to y ie ld some economies o f scale, 
enabling coverage o f a w ider number o f substantive areas. The increased emphasis on regional activities, 
balanced w i th country-specific work, i s common to a l l branches o f the Bank group. 

78. 
The assistance program ou t l ined in the CAS covers a per iod o f about three and a h a l f years 
(Fys03-06) in order to a l ign better w i th the po l i t ica l cycle in Honduras’. In terms o f new lending, the 
base case CAS program comprises 14 operations over NsO3 -06 , amounting in to ta l to about US$296 
m i l l i o n (SDR 211 m i l l ion) , o f which, about US$70 m i l l i o n wou ld be in the f o rm o f quick-disbursing 
budgetary support. This represents a somewhat lower IDA allocation than was made available to 
Honduras over the last CAS period, re f lec t ing bo th the tapering o f f o f extraordinary support related to 
pos t-M i tch reconstruction and Honduras’ poor f isca l outcomes since 2000. 

79. With regard to AAA and related knowledge services, the CAS includes tw o types o f activities. 
The f i r s t set includes core diagnostic analyses, wh ich wou ld be country-specific and address important 
cross-cutting issues inc lud ing deepened understanding o f poverty, growth, pub l ic expenditures and 
fiduciary issues. The second group o f AAA activities, as w e l l as many WBI-sponsored learn ing 
activities, wou ld be Central America-wide o r sub-regional in scope focusing on topics and themes 
relevant to several countries bu t inc lud ing su f f ic ien t country-specificity to further Honduras’ development 
agenda and support the design o f lending operations. In add i t ion to new lending, the Bank foresees a 
number o f areas where ZDF and trust fund 
resources cou ld be combined w i th the Bank’s 
exper iencehk i l ls to further key PRSP objectives. These grant-funded activities are in tegra l to the Bank’s 
assistance strategy fo r Honduras and are therefore inc luded in the CAS . I t should be noted, though, that 
although (based on current status) there i s a strong expectation that the grant-financed activities inc luded 
in the program w i l l go forward, f ina l approval o f the grants may l i e outside the Bank Group’s direct 
control. Moreover, additional grant-financed activities cou ld be supported in the CAS pe r iod as new 
pr ior i t ies emerge. 

80. 
The core areas o f the base case CAS program are described be low and summarized in Table 7. 
Wh i le the assistance activities are described under specific pillars, the close in ter- l inkage among the 
pillars necessarily means that the development impacts o f each ac t iv i ty w i l l no t necessarily be con f ined to 
the pillar under wh ich i t i s listed. Ac t iv i t ies wh ich are f u l l y cross-sectoral in scope are separately 
iden t i f ied . 

81. 
Cross-Cutting Activities. A ma jor vehicle fo r Bank support fo r the Govemment’s poverty 
reduction agenda during the CAS per iod wou ld be through the p rov is ion o f quick-disbursing budgetary 
support, v ia a PRSC (FY04) and an associated PRSC TA Credit ( N 0 4 ) . The PRSC and the PRSC T A C 
wou ld focus on consolidating reforms in the education sector inc lud ing w i t h respect to teacher wage and 
employment conditions, assisting the Govemment to address other c i v i l service re fo rm issues, imp rov ing 
pub l ic resource management and increasing transparency and p romo t ing greater c i v i l society par t ic ipa t ion 
in the formulation, implementation and mon i to r ing o f the poverty reduc t ion strategy. The PRSC TA 
credit w i l l , in ter alia, help Govemment to improve pub l ic resource management, building on the findings 
o f the CFAA , CPAR and work already being implemented under the ongo ing Economic and F inanc ia l 
Management TA Credit, wh ich was approved b y the Boa rd in FYOI. Ana ly t ica l work, wh ich w i l l assist 
Government in updating i t s PRSP, includes a Poverty Assessment, planned fo r FY05 and a Public 

Expenditure Review (PER) in FY06 . 

Support for Pillar I (Accelerating Equ itab le and Sustainable Growth) . W i t h i n this pillar, a 

82. 
major emphasis o f Bank Group support to Honduras invo lves strengthening and deepening the f inanc ia l 
sector. Fo l low ing on the completion o f the j o i n t IM F -W o r l d Bank F S A P repor t (FY03), tw o f inanc ia l 
sector operations are envisaged over the CAS period. The f i r s t i s a F inanc ia l Sector Technical 
Assistance project wh ich i s being presented to the Boa rd alongside this CAS, and aims at strengthening 
the f inanc ia l sector through changes in the lega l and ins t i tu t iona l framework f o r managing bank ing crises, 

A new Government i s expected to be in place in January 2006. 

imp rov ing supervision o f financial institutions and strengthening corporate governance and bankruptcy 
proceedings and enhancing the regime fo r AM L /C F T ( inc lud ing tra in ing fo r prosecutors and judges). A 
F inanc ia l Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) wou ld fo l low in F Y 0 4 to support the implementation o f 
actions developed under the FSTAC and prov ide budgetary support fo r pover ty reduction goals. 
addition to these Bank-supported activities, the I FC wou ld also seek opportunities to support the f inanc ia l 
sector w i th the a im o f he lp ing to improve the private sector’s access to capital. 

In 

83. 
The Bank Group wou ld also undertake a number o f other activities in support o f the f irs t p i l la r o f 
the PRSP. I n particular, a Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness Project (FYO4) wh ich wou ld focus on 
actions to reduce business costs, improve the investment climate, increase in f lows o f high valued added 
FDI in to the country, support MSME development and beg in to address r ig id i t ies in the labor market. 
This project wou ld also d irec t ly support the PRSP’s third p i l la r (reducing urban poverty) wh ich lays 
considerable emphasis on MSME development. Development o f the pro jec t wou ld invo lve close 
coordination among IDA, I FC and MIGA par t icu lar ly in the assessment o f ways to strengthen the 
business environment, increase investment flows, and competition policies. 

84. 
ZFC‘s support to Honduras i s provided through i t s assistance both on the country and regional 
levels, as in other counries in Central America. The priorities in Honduras during the CAS per iod w i l l 
include: (a) supporting growth o f export-oriented S M E s (through financial intermediaries and/or technical 
assistance); (b) supporting internationally-competitive f i r m s w i th inadequate long-term capital access; (c) 
helping to strengthen the business environment (through technical assistance); and (d) supporting the 
financial sector. The level o f financial support f rom I FC in i t s areas o f emphasis w i l l continue to depend on 
viable investment opportunities in Honduras specifically, and the Central American region as a whole. T h i s , 
in turn, w i l l be closely related to overall improvements in the business environment, regulatory framework, 
and macroeconomic stability. In the Central American region, I FC expects i t s emphases to be centred in the 
fo l low ing areas: (i) physical infrastructure; (ii) strengthening and deepening the financial sector; (iii) 
supporting competitive f i r m s in agriculture and industry; and (iv) promo t ing investments in to Central 
America f rom other La t in American and emerging market economies. 

85. 

D raw ing on lessons o f past experience and wo rk ing closely w i t h IDA and MIGA, I F C aims, 
during this CAS period, to give high p r io r i ty to smaller businesses through non-investment support such 
as technical advice and capacity bu i ld ing activities. One ac t iv i ty envisioned i s the establishment o f a 
mu l t i-coun try SME fac i l i ty covering Honduras as w e l l as three other L a t i n Amer ican countries’. The 
fac i l i ty ’s target areas include imp rov ing S M E access to finance, imp rov ing the business enabling 
environment and strengthening areas w i t h a high potential fo r export. Ac t iv i t ies in Honduras under the 
fac i l i ty are expected to include support to export-oriented businesses in areas such as ornamental plants, 
wood products and tourism, programs linked to I F C investments in second-tier banks and support fo r red 
tape s imp l i f ica t ion . 

86. 

MZGA w i l l be wo rk ing independently and in con junc t ion w i t h the Trade Fac i l i ta t ion and 
Competitiveness Project to strengthen the ins t i tu t iona l framework f o r FDI attraction, create linkages w i th 
the loca l private sector, and facilitate higher valued-added direct investment f lows . MIGA conducted an 
assessment o f the national investment promo t ion agency, FIDE, in the f a l l o f 2002 wh ich provides the 
basis fo r MIGA’s present wo rk program in Honduras. The export or ien ta t ion o f Honduras ex is t ing FDI, 
the upcom ing CAFTA , recognized weaknesses in the investment environment and ins t i tu t iona l 
framework, inc lud ing FIDE (as identified in the PRSP and MIGA’s assessment) po in t to the importance 
o f technical assistance in this area. MIGA w i l l wo rk f irs t w i t h the Government o f Honduras and FIDE to 

This LAC SME facility, which i s expected to cover Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru, i s scheduled to be 
presented to the Board in FY03. 

devise an investment promo t ion strategy that w i l l d ivers i fy and fac i l i ta te higher valued-added FDI. This 
w i l l be fo l lowed b y capacity building fo r FIDE and other institutions invo lved in the investment process, 
guidance in launch ing proactive promo t ion campaigns to target new sectors, programs to imp rove the 
image o f Honduras as an investment platform, and work w i t h the loca l private sector to increase linkages 
between foreign investors and loca l businesses. MIGA’s previous experience in the design and 
implementation o f the investment promo t ion component o f the Nicaragua competitiveness program 
provides practical lessons that can be applied in Honduras inc lud ing impor tan t ly an established system o f 
cooperation to fac i l i ta te the success o f the Trade Fac i l i ta t ion and Competitiveness Project. 

87. 

F I A S i s also collaborating closely w i t h the Honduran Government in support o f the Na t iona l 
Competitiveness Program. Recently FIAS undertook a rev iew o f Honduras’ draft compe t i t ion law, and 
fo l low-up work in support o f the creation o f a competition po l icy framework and agency i s expected. 
Presently under preparation i s a second technical assistance project on fore ign direct investment and labor 
s k i l l s tra in ing w i t h the objective o f rev iew ing the effectiveness o f the ex is t ing vocational education and 
tra in ing program in Honduras and developing re fo rm alternatives to better meet industry needs fo r labor 
s k i l l s . I t should be noted, too, that the Bank w i l l undertake an Investment Climate Assessment in F Y 0 4 
to help deepen understanding o f the constraints to investment in Honduras. A Country Economic 
Memorandum (CEM ) planned fo r F Y 0 4 wou ld also prov ide support to Honduras’ efforts to accelerate 
inclusive growth. F ina l ly , a planned Central America-wide reg iona l study on CAFTA wou ld be 
completed in FY04, to be fo l lowed in FY05 by a reg iona l study on Trade Facilitation. I F C wou ld also 
iden t i fy activities to help Honduras, and the Central Amer ica reg ion more broadly, to take advantage o f 
the C A F T A in i t ia t ive . 

88. 

Support f o r Pillar I1 (Reducing R u r a l Poverty). In support o f the PRSP’s second pillar (rura l 
poverty reduction) the CAS program w i l l include the Copan Valley Development Project (FY03) wh ich 
aims to spur economic ac t iv i ty (particularly tourism) and reduce pover ty - especially among indigenous 
groups -in one o f the poorest ru ra l regions o f Honduras. Three add i t iona l rural-focused projects are 
envisaged over the CAS period. The first i s a Land Regularization and Administration Project (FY04), 
wh ich w i l l prov ide con t inu ing support to land titling, regularization o f trad i t iona l rights o f occupants o f 
pub l ic forest lands and land registration efforts. The project w i l l lay special emphasis on safeguarding the 
property rights o f women (both single women and women i n ma r i ta l unions) and indigenous groups. 
Moreover, the project, wh ich w i l l also be implemented in urban areas, should have significant pos i t ive 
implications fo r bo th ru ra l and urban poverty and s ign i f ican t ly imp rove the environment f o r business 
development. The second operation in support o f this pillar i s a Forestry and Ru ra l Productivity Project 
(F04), wh ich w i l l , inter alia, tackle community forestry and incorpora t ion o f loca l populations and 
communities in to management o f (and receipt o f benefits from) pub l ic forests, strengthen p rov is ion o f 
pr iva t ized technical services fo r poverty reduction and economic diversification, and, support 
involvement o f mun ic ipa l governments in management and conservation o f natural resources and forestry 
development. The third project Rura l Infrastructure (FY06), wou ld focus on coordinated development 
o f ru ra l infrastructure in poor areas, building on the findings o f a Regional Study of Ru ra l 
Infrastructure, scheduled fo r comp le t ion in FY05 . As has been established through numerous analyses 
o f ru ra l poverty, infrastructure i s perhaps the most v i ta l ingredient in p romo t ing increased p roduc t iv i ty 
and grow th in agriculture and o f f - fa rm activities. Wh i le no Honduras-specific analytical wo rk i s planned 
i n this area, two other Central Amer ica-w ide studies w i l l bene f i t Honduras - these include a study o f the 
impact o f the Coffee Crisis and means o f addressing emerging issues (FY03), and an analysis o f the 
Drivers of Rura l Growth in FY04 . The latter w i l l also analyze p rom is ing approaches to the 
mainstreaming o f environmental issues in a range o f developmental programs.

Support for Pillar I11 (Reducing Urban Poverty). In large measure, the Bank Group’s strategy 

89. 
fo r addressing urban poverty during the CAS per iod focuses on imp rov ing income earning opportunities 
fo r the poor through SME development (v ia the Trade Fac i l i ta t ion and Competitiveness project under 
P i l la r I) and regularization o f property rights (Land Regularization Project under P i l la r 11). In addition, 
bo th as a support to enhancing the environment fo r business and, especially, to improve the qua l i ty o f 
urban l i fe , an Urban Services and Urban Violence project i s planned fo r FY05 . Wh i le there are a 
number o f outstanding issues in the urban water and sanitation areas as discussed in preceding sections o f 
this report, no significant new lending i s planned in this area given the heavy invo lvemen t o f LDB and a 
number o f other external partners. However, to help Government and i t s partners in mov ing forward in 
the sector and to maintain an active po l icy dialogue, the Bank expects to undertake two activities in the 
water sector and one ac t iv i ty in sanitation, using grant funds. These are be ing closely coordinated w i t h 
other partners in the sector. The f i r s t o f these, invo lves a j o i n t Government o f Netherlands-Bank 
supported ac t iv i ty to tes t innova t ive approaches to design Pro-poor Water Transactions aimed at 
extending water services to poor people and unconnected communities v ia pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships 
(FY03). The second invo lves the development o f a Comprehensive Water Strategy fo r Honduras under a 
separate Netherlands Government grant (FY04). The third activity, also expected in FY04 , concerns the 
testing o f New Sanitation Technologies w i t h support f r om the Japan Social Development Fund. 

Support f o r Pillar I V (Investing in Human Capital). G iven recently approved operations in 

90. 
education and health (FYs 01 and 02 respectively), very l im i ted new lend ing i s planned in this CAS 
period. 
In each sector, however, the Bank w i l l play a c r i t ica l ro le in wo rk ing w i t h Government and 
external partners to program and implement new programs be ing supported v ia grant funds. In education, 
the Bank w i l l p lay a coordinating ro le in assisting Government to imp lemen t i t s E FA - F T Z proposal, 
including wo rk ing w i th a number o f external partners to establish a sector-wide approach to improve the 
qua l i ty o f basic education, w i t h the a im o f achieving universal comp le t ion o f pr imary education b y the 
year 2015, as noted in B o x B above. The EFA-FTI plan wou ld complement the ongoing, Bank-supported 
Commun i ty Based Education Project, wh ich i s focused on expanding coverage through commun i ty- 
managed schools. Consideration i s also being given to supporting the EFA-FTI proposal w i t h IDA 
funding. A no t iona l IDA a l loca t ion o f US$5 m i l l i o n has currently been inc luded in the program, but this 
wou ld be revised upwards o r downwards, depending on the ava i lab i l i ty o f resources f r om other sources. 
In add i t ion to support fo r basic education v ia the EFA-FTI, an Education Policy Note w i l l be completed 
in FY05 , wh ich w i l l take a broader look at the challenges i n Honduras’ education sector. 

91. 
The ongoing Honduras Hea l th System Re fo rm Project, wh ich was approved by the Board in 
FY02 , combines support fo r po l icy reforms in system f inanc ing and service de l ivery w i th funding fo r 
investment subprojects. The investment subprojects have a focus on imp rov ing the qua l i ty and coverage 
o f maternal and ch i ld health services, w i th the objective o f fur ther reduc ing maternal mor ta l i ty and in fan t 
and c h i l d mor ta l i ty over the CAS period. A Hea l th Policy Note programmed fo r F Y 0 4 w i l l suggest 
directions fo r further sectoral development. In addition, the Bank expects to assist Government in the 
design o f a comprehensive HZV /AZDS program to be financed f r om a US$22 m i l l i o n grant made 
available to Honduras b y the G loba l Fund fo r AIDS, TB and Ma la r ia . The Bank w i l l also help in the 
e f fo r t to combat AIDS v ia a Centra l Amer ica Regional HZV /AZDS project (FY05) to support activities 
that are best supported at a reg iona l level, including, possibly, reg iona l surveillance, regional training, a 
regional reference laboratory, and reg iona l prevention e f for ts aimed at m igran t populations. 

Support for Pillar V (Social Protection and Vulnerable Groups). Building on past experience 

92. 
w i th Bank support fo r Honduras’ Social Investment Fund (FHIS) and the findings o f a planned F Y 0 4 
Central America-wide study on Shocks and Social Protection, the C A S envisages two new projects to 
extend safety nets fo r the poor and protect vulnerable groups. The f i r s t o f these, a Nutr it ion and Social 
Protection Project (FY05), w i l l , in ter alia, assist Government in deve lop ing and imp lemen t ing a 
comprehensive strategy to address c h i l d ma lnu tr i t ion and continue and expand the most successful safety 

ne t activities undertaken as part o f the ongoing F H I S V project. A second operation, Nuestras Raices 
(Our Roots), planned fo r FY05, w i l l also bu i ld on a successful component o f the FHIS V, wh ich 
implemented a rad ica l community driven development approach to the pr ior i t iza t ion , design and 
financing o f about 4,200 small and micro-projects among indigenous Honduran communities. The 
component, wh ich w i l l continue to be financed under the free-standing Nuestra Raices operation du r ing 
this CAS period, also had a successful gender strategy, w i t h women compr is ing over 40 percent o f the 
participants in training, small-scale sub-projects and commun i ty banks under the component. Wh i le 
building on the successes o f the FHIS component, the planned FY05 project w i l l also t ry to address some 
weaknesses in the des ign o f the sub-projects and community bank schemes to strengthen the ir long- term 
sustainability. 
In addition, the Bank w i l l implement a Norweg ian grant-funded ac t iv i ty to promote 
Indigenous People’s Sustainable Development (FY04), wh ich wou ld support the design and 
implementation o f activities targeted to indigenous peoples w i th in the context o f broader development 
programs and projects. F ina l ly , in v iew o f grow ing concern w i th in Honduras regarding the welfare status 
o f out-of-school adolescents and youth - including l ow s k i l l s , high unemployment, h igh teen pregnancy

program in support o f Honduras’ efforts to improve governance and transparency. In this regard, key 
ongoing pieces o f work include the CFAA, wh ich i s scheduled fo r completion in FY03, and a CPAR 
Update wh ich w i l l be completed in FY04 . As noted above, implementation o f the recommendations o f each 
of these reviews w i l l be supported through the PRSC,and the PRSC TA Credit. The Bank i s also wo rk ing 
w i th Honduras to develop a Judicial Reform Project (FY04) wh ich wou ld support the development and 
implementation o f a modernization program for the supreme court and the lowe r courts, strengthening o f 
human resource management capacities fo r jud ic ia l and administrative staff, strengthening o f access to 
justice by the poor and disadvantaged segments o f the population (e.g.; women, children and indigenous 
populations), and promotion o f transparency and c i v i l society participation in administration o f jus t ice in 
urban and rural areas. T h e project wou ld also provide tra in ing to judges and other jud ic ia l system staff on 
the handling and ajudication o f issues arising f rom the enactment o f new laws in a range o f sectors as 
required fo r the implementation o f the country’s PRSP. The project preparation wou ld draw upon diagnostic 
reports prepared by the USA ID , IDB, CIDA and others. In addition, an IDF grant wou ld be made available 
for implementation o f Honduras’ Anti-Corruption strategy (para 43), led by the Na t iona l An t i-Corrup t ion 
Council. Finally, in support o f the Govemment’s efforts to move forward w i t h decentralization o f 
responsibilities fo r key basic and social services A F Y 0 5 Central Amer ica regional study on 
Decentralization w i l l include a special focus on Honduras. 

94. 

W i t h regard to promoting environmental sustainability, the Bank’s core objectives during the CAS 
per iod are to assist the Government to conserve and promote sustainable use o f Honduras’ natural and 
soc ia lku l tura l resources. Three projects listed under Pillar II wou ld p lay an important part in supporting this 
goal-namely, 
the Copan Valley Development Project, the Land Regularization Project and the Forestry 
and Rura l Productivity Project. B iod ivers i ty conservation i s also a major p r io r i ty fo r the Bank given the 
links between conservation and environmental services offered b y forested areas (hydrological services, 
carbon storage, non-timber forest products and tourism) and the Bank‘s leadership on the Mesoamerican 
B io log ica l Corridor in Central America as we l l as on i t s marine extension, the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef 
System. W i t h several conservation projects in the Central Amer ica Reg ion and Honduras now nearing 
completion, two new GEF financed activities are planned fo r the CAS period. These include: the 
Consolidation o f the Transfrontier Corazon Biosphere Reserve Project (FY04), a bi-national (Honduras and 
Nicaragua) project focusing on the core o f the Mesoamerican B io log ica l Project in Honduras; and a Central- 
America-wide project on Indigenous Management of Na tu ra l Areas (FY04). In addition, Honduras wou ld 

be a beneficiary under another Americas-wide GEF project, the hemispheric leve l Inter-American 
B iod ivers i ty In forma t ion Ne twork Project, which w i l l also be finalized in FY04. Finally, the Bank wou ld 
continue to support Honduran efforts to reduce the population's vulnerability to natural disasters, building 
on the ongoing Emergency Disaster Management Project which was approved in WOO. Tw o non-lending 
activities are planned for the CAS period - the f i r s t wou ld be the implementation o f a Japan Social 
Development Fund grant to promote Community Disaster Management (FY04) approaches in 20 o f 
Tegucigalpa's poorest neighborhoods and the second wou ld be a Central-America-wide analysis o f 
development strategies fo r Disaster Prevention Management (FY05). A l though the Bank recognizes the 
importance o f po l lu t ion and water contamination isssues in Honduras, there are no proposed W o r l d Bank 
programs in this area given a more active ro le being played b y other donors inc lud ing IDB. 

95. 

In each o f the six pillars, Bank support fo r capacity building in Honduras wou ld incorporate WBZ 
activities. During the CAS period WBI expects to implement a number o f learning and knowledge 
dissemination programs, fo r the Central American region in areas such as community enpowerment and 
social inclusion, education reform, 
fiscal po l icy for poverty alleviation, deregulation, mun ic ipa l 
development and govemance (incuding jud ic ia l reform). A l l o f these activities w i l l be open to Honduran 
participants. The Bank, through WBI, i s also prepared, should the Honduran Govemment request it, to 
implement country-specific activities aimed at the development o f a stronger national consensus on the core 
outsanding re form issues under the PRSP. 

CAS Scenarios 

96. 

The CAS envisages three scenarios for lend ing to Honduras during the FYO3-06 period: (i) a low 
case, amounting to SDR161 m i l l ion or approximately US$226 m i l l ion , wh ich wou ld comprise 12 
investment operations aimed at strengthening govemance and transparency, addressing long-standing 
barriers to the inclusion o f the poor in economic growth, and investing in human capital; (ii) a base case o f

Triggers for moving to the base case

9 Satisfactory implementation o f the PRSP as

total resource inflows (encompassing all donor and domestic 
resources). 

9 Substantially improved climate for private sector development as 
demonstrated by establishment o f a unified property registry and 
implementation o f a satisfactory competition framework. 

SDR211 m i l l ion o r about US$296 m i l l ion wh ich wou ld include an additional $70 m i l l i o n (over the l ow 
case) in fast disbursing budgetary support fo r a PRSC operation (US$45 m i l l ion ) and a financial sector 
adjustment credit ($25 million); and, (iii) a h igh case o f SDR274 m i l l ion o r about US$384 m i l l i o n wh ich 
wou ld include additional funds (o f about US$28 m i l l ion) fo r the FSAC plus a second PRSC operation o f 
about US$60 m i l l ion . Table 8 above presents the specific triggers iden t i f ied fo r each case. I t should be 
noted that, w i th in the high case, triggers specific to each operation have been identified, that wou ld 
demonstrate exceptional progress in addressing the core issues related to each operation. As such, 
expansion o f the FSAC to US$53 m i l l ion wou ld require decisive action to address vulnerabilities in the 
banking system. Similarly, a PRSC I1 wou ld depend on demonstrated success in advancing PRSP priorities 
including good governance, substantially strengthened pub l ic sector management and reduction o f key 
structural barriers to broad-based economic growth. Finally, in interpreting the table, i t should be bome in 
mind that at the present time, in the absence o f a f ina l agreement on a satisfactory macroeconomic 
framework and some uncertainty as to the t im ing o f the passage o f a comprehensive c i v i l service re form 
law, lending levels to Honduras w i l l be consistent w i th the l o w case. Based on recent actions b y the 
Government to address these areas, however, there i s an expectation that movement to the base case should 
occur later this calendar year. 

CAS P r o g r am Results a n d M o n i t o r i n g 

97. 
G iven the close interrelationship between this CAS and the Govemment's Poverty Reduction 
Strategy, movements over the mid-2003 to early 2006 per iod towards achievement o f the long- term 
benchmarks/outcome targets included in the PRSP are relevant to assessing the impac t o f the CAS in 
general terms. This i s particularly true in the case o f PRSP targets aligned w i t h the MDGs (given in 
Table 4), wh ich are an ins t i tu t iona l p r io r i ty fo r the Bank. However, to the extent that achievement o f the 
PRSP targets involves a large number o f Honduran and extemal actors and institutions, making 
a t tr ibu t ion d i f f icu l t , the impact o f this CAS should also - perhaps p r ima r i ly -- be assessed in terms o f the 
growth and poverty-reducing impacts o f the assistance activities in wh ich the Bank intends to p lay a

direct role. Table 9 lays out the key outcome, program and po r t fo l io indicators, wh ich should be used to 
assess the impact o f the CAS These benchmarks are closely linked to the Bank’s and other partners’ 
planned assistance activities, as shown in detail i n Annex B1. . Fo r example, governance improvements 
are closely l inked t o the Bank’s and IDB’s ongoing program o f f iduc iary assessments and jud ic ia l reforms 
coupled w i t h implementation support f rom ongoing and planned lend ing operations (EMTAC , PRSC I, 
PRSC TAC , An t i-Corrup t ion IDF and Judicial Reform). The f isca l and economic grow th targets are 
related bo th to lend ing (PRSC I, F inanc ia l sector TA, FSAC, Trade Fac i l i ta t ion and Competitiveness, and 
possible I F C lending) and non-lending (CEM, support fo r CAFTA , Investment C l ima te Assessment, and 
IFC, FIAS and MIGA TA). Rura l targets (plus some benchmarks related to gender and indigenous 
groups) are supported, inter alia, by the Land Regularization Project, Forestry and Rura l Produc t iv i ty 
Project, Rura l Infrastructure Project and Copan Va l ley Regional Development Project as we l l as a number 
o f ESW tasks. F ina l ly , social sector benchmarks and some targets related to vulnerable groups are closely 
linked to ongoing education and health operations as we l l as new activities such as the EFA, HIV/AIDS 
grant funded program, Nuestras Raices and the Nu t r i t ion and Social Protection Project. 

CAS Program R i s k s 

98 . 

The CAS faces three major r i s k s : 

Potential for Macroeconomic Instability. Honduras remains vulnerable t o natural disasters (El N i f io , 
drought, hurricanes) and to terms o f trade shocks (commodity pr ice declines fo r coffee, bananas, 
A f r ican pa lm o i l and o i l pr ice hikes), either o f wh ich cou ld produce setbacks to the Government’s 
macroeconomic program. F isca l slippages due to fa i lure to curb the rising pub l ic sector wage b i l l and 
lower-than-expected revenue co l lec t ion wou ld limit the mob i l iza t ion o f domestic savings fo r poverty 
reduction spending. Moreover, the f rag i l i ty o f the f inanc ia l system makes Honduras vulnerable to 
crises triggered b y external shocks o r corporate governance deficiencies. Close mon i to r ing and 
support prov ided b y the IMF’s PRGF program and the Bank and IDB’s programmatic budgetary 
support loans wou ld help to iden t i fy potential problems early on and assist the Government to take 
t ime ly remedial measures. 

Political and Social Risks. B road po l i t ica l support w i l l be needed to move fo rwa rd w i t h the 
ambitious legislative agenda needed to implement the PRSP. In the short term, the Government w i l l 
need to get Congressional approval fo r a C i v i l Service L a w in order t o conclude a new PRGF 
arrangement w i t h the IMF - debt re l ie f associated w i th the H I PC Comp le t ion Po in t and significant 
external f inanc ing f r om the I F I s and many b i la tera l partners i s contingent on this. Po l i t ica l 
opportunism and a strident trade un ion movement that i s increasingly more coordinated threaten the 
passage o f these reforms and cou ld provoke large-scale social unrest. Actions be ing taken b y 
Government to rev ive and systematize regular consultations w i t h diverse stakeholders should he lp to 
lessen this risk. Moreover, the Bank has been instrumental in mob i l iz ing a number o f external 
partners to assist the Government in the formu la t ion and imp lemen ta t ion o f a comprehensive 
communications strategy in support o f economic re fo rm and to generate widespread understanding o f 
the r i s k s and opportunities o f emerging development challenges (e.g. CAFTA ) . 

Institutional Capacity. Weaknesses in government f inanc ia l management, the jud ic iary , the supreme 
audit agency and executing l i n e m in is tr ies cou ld negatively a f fec t C A S program implementation. 
Conscious o f this, the Government has placed very high p r i o r i t y on imp rov ing governance and 
fighting corruption, and has taken important actions in these areas w i t h some notable successes. To

the parame ters o f the macroeconom ic f ramewo rk . A d r a f t ve rs ion o f the Progress R e p o r t was 
consu l ted t h r o u g h 16 workshops i n v o l v i n g several sector groups (“mesas sectoriales”) in tegra ted 
by govemmen t , c i v i l soc ie ty and dono r c omm u n i t y representatives, and t h r o u g h the Consu l ta t ive

and the d o n o r c omm u n i t y ( i n c l u d i n g the B a n k and Fund) have presented commen ts a n d

2. 

T h e d r a f t Progress R e p o r t ma in ta ins the same l o n g t e rm v i s i o n o f the PRSP. I t proposes t o 
upda te some elements o f the strategy in response t o recen t deve lopmen ts and de f ines some spec i f ic 
steps for im p l em e n t i n g the strategy t o reach in termed ia te targets set f o r the p e r i o d 2003-2005 in 
l i n e with g o v emm e n t p r io r i t ies . In par t icu lar , the i n a b i l i t y t o c om p l y with the p rev ious PRG F 
arrangemen t has l e d t o a systematic r e v i s i o n o f ce r ta in elements o f the macroeconom ic strategy a n d 
s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms , but the cen t ra l p o v e r t y r e d u c t i o n targe t rema ins the same. T h a t i s , the d ra f t 
Progress R e p o r t s t i l l aspires to reach the M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t G o a l f o r p o v e r t y reduc t ion , 
w h i c h w o u l d c a l l f o r a 2 4 percentage p o i n t r e d u c t i o n in ex treme p o v e r t y be tween 2 0 0 1 and 2015 . 
T o ach ieve this goal, the Progress R e p o r t estimates tha t Hondu ras ’ econom ic g r o w t h ra te w i l l have 
t o increase t o a n annua l average o f 5 .1 percen t ove r tha t per iod , o r m o r e than doub le the 2 percen t 
averaged o v e r the las t f o u r years.

H o n d u r a s has made considerable advances during the 1990s in p o v e r t y r e d u c t i o n and 
im p r o v i n g soc ia l ind ica tors . This im p r o v i n g t r e n d was t em p o r a r i l y in te r rup ted by hu r r icane M i t c h 
in 1998, but resumed in 2000. T h e progress made since the full PRSP was comp le ted in 2 0 0 1 
appears t o h a v e been modest, with abou t h a l f the PRSP targets f o r w h i c h data i s ava i lab le h a v i n g 
been m e t a f te r one year. T h e ex treme p o v e r t y ( ind igen t) ra te dec l ined t o 45 percen t in 2002, in l i n e 
with the PRSP target, w h i l e the advances in the r e d u c t i o n o f c h i l d ma lnu t r i t ion , ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y

Impor tan t po l icy measures envisaged in the PRSP that cou ld no t be implemented so far 
include the fo l low ing legislation: 
0 The c i v i l service re fo rm l a w 
the energy and water sector framework laws 
the forestry l aw 
0 Reforms to the Labor Code 
0 Re forms o f the Commerc ia l Code

the Social Security Re fo rm L a w 
the Hous ing Sector Modern iza t ion Law , and 
the Education Framework L a w 
These pend ing reforms are being rev ised and reprogrammed fo r submission t o Congress. In 
hindsight, the PRSP may have underestimated the comp lex i ty o f developing these laws and the 
effort requ ired to achieve a su f f ic ien t consensus for their passage within an extremely short time 
frame.

The draft PRSP Progress Repor t documents that pub l ic spending on the pover ty reduc ing 
programs identified in the PRSP has averaged on ly 50 percent o f the spending leve ls projected fo r 
2001 and 2002. The PRSP had envisaged a to ta l spending o n pover ty reduc ing projects o f US$343 
m i l l i o n in 2001 and US$380 m i l l i o n in 2002, but on ly managed to execute US$202 m i l l i o n and 
US$165 m i l l i o n (averaging to 2.5 percent o f GDP) in those two years. T h i s spending shor t fa l l i s 
ma in ly explained by (i) capacity constraints that prevented a faster imp lemen ta t ion o f new 
programs envisioned in the PRSP and (ii) shortfalls in domestic funds fo r pover ty reducing 
projects. The draft Progress Repor t indicates that the to ta l H I PC interim assistance r e c e i v e d f r om 
the Bank, IDB and IMF during 2000-02 amounted to US$81.7 m i l l i o n . O f this amount, US$67.2 
m i l l i o n were spent on pove r ty reduc ing programs, with the balance p laced in the Pover ty Reduc t ion 
Fund wa i t ing to be assigned.

F ina l ly , the dra f t Progress Repor t brings to light deficiencies in the t rack ing mechanism 
used to account for the sources and uses o f savings f r om H I PC debt r e l i e f . T h e PRSP takes a 
na r row a view o f pover ty reduc ing spending by limiting i t s e l f to new pro jec ts financed with

Annex F - Debt Sustainability Analysis 

1. 
Honduras reached the H IPC Dec is ion Po in t in June 2000, qua l i fy ing under the f isca l 
cr i ter ia (NPV o f debt-to-revenue ra t io above 250 percent), but no t under the export cr i ter ia (NPV 
o f debt-to-export ra t io above 150 percent). Since that time, Honduras’ external pub l ic debt has 
remained v i r tua l ly unchanged in U S Do l la r te rms . 
I t s to ta l external pub l ic debt amounted 
toUS$4,228 m i l l i o n in nom ina l t e rm s at the end o f 2002, versus US$4,288 m i l l i o n at the end o f 
1999. This represents a s ign i f ican t decline in Honduras’ overa l l debt burden: in n e t present value 
terms (NPV), the to ta l pub l ic external debt declined as a share o f exports o f good and se rv ices 
f r om 142 percent in 1999 to 125 percent in 2002, and as a share o f GDP f r om about 59 percen t to 
46 percent. I t also declined as a share o f government revenues, f rom 322 percen t in 1999 to 252 
percent in 2002, putting i t very close to the debt sustainability threshold under the f isca l w indow . 
(The domestic pub l ic debt has remained steady at around 5 percent o f GDP).

Source; the original predictions are f i om the H IPC Decision Point Document (June 2000) and re fer to projections after 
enhanced H IPC In i t ia t ive assistance, wh i le the revised estimates are fro the IMF A r t i c l e I V Consultations Report (Ap r i l 
2003). 

2. 
The decline in Honduras’ external debt burden i s significant, but no t as pronounced as 
had been pro jec ted in 2000. The m a i n reasons for this divergence are the slower-than-predicted 
g row th o f exports and pub l ic revenues. Expor ts were projected at the Dec is ion Po in t to grow by 
17 percent per annum in rea l t e rm s during 2000-2002, but they on ly grew by about 2 percen t 
du r ing that period. S im i lar ly , ra t io o f central government revenues (excluding grants) to GDP 
was projected to increase t o 19 percent in that period, b u t remained instead near 18 percent. 
Honduras was also expected to reach the H I PC Comp le t ion Po in t in June 2002, but this has been 
postponed w i t h the dera i l ing o f the PRGF-supported macroeconomic program in 200 1, so that 
some o f the H I PC assistance envisioned fo r 2002 cou ld n o t be obtained. 

3. 
Even though expor t g row th and central government revenue g row th remained 
considerably be low the pro jec ted values, Honduras’ external debt levels did no t expand. This 
fortuitous outcome was m a i n l y due to the unexpectedly rap id g row th in n e t transfers, which i s 
ma in ly attributable to the g row th o f fore ign remittance in f lows ; see Tab le F2. The lowe r curren t 
account de f ic i ts ca l led fo r a lowe r capital account su rp lus , and correspondingly lower pressure on 
b o t h the pub l ic and p r iva te sectors to bo r row abroad.
