i. 
T u r k e y has lea rned f r o m crises and been strengthened b y re fo rms ove r the past 
f ive years. N a t u r a l d isas ters as w e l l as f inanc ia l crises were p a i n f u l but also shocked the system 
and focused the n a t i o n on the need f o r fundamental re fo rms t o mode rn ize the coun t ry and i t s 
governance. T h e economy started t o rebound s t rong ly last year, and the Government, w h i c h 
came t o p ow e r w i t h s ign i f ican t popu la r support f o l l ow i n g ea r ly elections at the end o f 2002, has 
n ow the oppo r tun i ty t o put Tu rkey o n a sustainable economic g r ow t h path. But this w i l l be a 
challenge as the economy, w h i l e recovering, i s s t i l l vulnerable and the debt remains high. The 
in te rna t iona l env i ronmen t presents b o t h economic uncertainties and po l i t ica l r i s k s that absorb the 
Government’s attention. The M i d d l e East remains on edge. T h e Cyp rus question continues t o 
be unresolved. T h e in te rna t iona l economic situation remains cloudy. Nevertheless, i f Tu rkey i s 
successful in steering th rough this d i f f i c u l t pe r iod and ge t t ing o n the pa th towards EU accession, 
the coun t ry c o u l d achieve stable g row th and im p r o v e d l iv ing cond i t ions . The B a n k G roup 
Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS ) i s designed t o help T u r k e y t o d o so. 
In discussing the CAS , Execut ive D i rec to rs m a y w ish to address these questions: 
D o the ob jec t ive and m a i n themes o f the C A S adequately re f lec t Tu rkey ’s economic 
p r io r i t ies? 
A r e the lending scenarios, including the sharp d i f fe rence between the high case and the 
l o w case and the r o u g h l y 5 0 percent adjustment lend ing in the high case, appropriate fo r 
Tu rkey ’s specific circumstances? 
D o D i rec to rs support the con t inued emphasis on p rog ramma t ic lend ing in the areas o f 
p u b l i c and f inanc ia l sector re fo rm as a core o f the high case scenario? 
T h e ob ject ive o f the C A S i s to he lp T u r k e y imp lemen t fundamen ta l re fo rms to 
reduce economic vu lne rab i l i ty and achieve h igh and stable g row th , and continue the 
process o f address ing some long neglected social a n d env i ronmen ta l problems. The last 
C A S focused h e a v i l y o n c r is is management. This C A S aims at reduc ing the risk o f reemergence 
of crises and h e l p i n g T u r k e y address the many economic cha l lenges o f preparing for EU 
membership. The planned assistance p rog ram f o r FY 0 4 - 0 6 and the expected outcomes are 
structured around f o u r development themes in l i n e with the Government’s p r io r i t ies : (i) sound 
macroeconomics and governance; (ii) equitable human and social development; (iii) attractive 
business c l ima te and knowledge; and ( iv ) strong env i ronmen ta l management and disaster 
prevention. 
i v . 
T h e two B a n k lend ing scenarios described in this document a r e ve ry d i f fe ren t in 
size a n d composition. This reflects the r i s k s associated w i t h the assistance strategy, as 
summarized in v i i . be low and in Chapter V. A lending p rog ram o f US$4.5 b i l l i o n i s envisaged 
in the h i g h case and US$1.3 billion in the l o w case. The program under the h i g h case w i l l 
inc lude support f o r the economic r e f o rm program, focus ing o n public sector management and 

. . . 

accountability, and the business climate, including the f inanc ia l sector, t o address the underlying 

economic p rob lems that make the Turkish economy vulnerable. T r igge rs f o r the high case are 
based o n k e y re fo rms supported b y ongo ing and p lanned adjustment operations as w e l l as o n 
indicators o f satisfactory macroeconomic performance. 
I f l a c k o f progress on the r e f o rm 
p rog ram were to push B a n k lend ing t o the l o w case, B a n k support w o u l d concentrate o n human 
development, disaster and env i ronmen t management, and loca l l e v e l interventions t o reduce

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT 
AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION 
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
ON A COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP 
FOR THE 
REPUBLIC OF TURKEY 

I. 

THE COUNTRY CONTEXT 

Economic Crisis and Recovery 

1. 

F o r many years Turkey’s economy seemingly defied rationality but fiscal 
imbalances and delayed structural reforms finally led to a series of crises. Until the la te 

1990s, Tu rkey achieved rea l economic g r ow t h o f 4-5 percent in the face o f ch ron ica l ly high 
in f la t ion . Bo r row ing , domestic and international, a l lowed Tu rkey t o keep up this h i g h -w i r e act 
despite accumulating macroeconomic vu lne rab i l i t ies . I t f i n a l l y came t o an e n d in 1999 when the 
economy shrank by some 6 percent. Tu rkey then embarked o n an amb i t ious exchange rate-based 
d is in f la t ion p rog ram comb ined w i t h structural reforms. Howeve r , the process o f imp lemen t ing 
these second generation structural re fo rms (the first r o u n d o f r e f o rm was imp lemen ted some 15 
years be fo re and focused o n trade and f inanc ia l l ibe ra l iza t ion ) was in te r rup ted in ea r ly 2001 by a 
ve ry severe economic c r is is w h i c h f o l l ow e d o n an earlier b o u t o f f inanc ia l ins tab i l i ty in 
Novembe r 2000. The c r is is h a d been building up f o r some t im e and was the resu l t o f t w o 
ove r r id ing factors: 
the emergence o f huge f isca l imbalances ove r the 1990s resu l t ing f r o m 
unde r ly ing structural imbalances and r ig id i t ies , and the l a c k o f a t ten t ion t o the accumulation o f 
systemic bank ing sector r i s k s . 

The 2001 c r is is was deep and triggered the start of fundamental reform. The 

2. 
authorities responded t o the c r is is b y des ign ing a N e w Econom ic P rog ram (NEP) announced in 
M a y 2001, f o l l ow i n g the collapse o f the c r aw l i n g p e g and subsequent devaluation. The k e y 
structural and social elements o f the p rog ram were: (i) a mac ro - f ramewo rk designed t o restore 
f inanc ia l s tab i l i ty and ensure p u b l i c debt sustainability--principally th rough a fu r the r t igh ten ing 
o f f isca l p o l i c y w i t h a p r im a r y surplus target o f 5 .5 percent o f GNP in 2001 increasing t o 6.5 
percent thereafter; (ii) r a p i d res t ruc tu r ing o f the bank ing sector--especially o f state banks and 
inso lven t p r iva te banks in te rvened by the regu la to ry au tho r i ty (BRSA)--based o n large resource 
transfers f r o m the budget; (iii) a mo re amb i t ious p rog ram o f p u b l i c sector re fo rms centered o n 
deeper structural f isca l re fo rms and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms t o im p r o v e p u b l i c expenditure 
management and p u b l i c governance; (iv) a renewed p r iva t iza t ion d r i v e in comb ina t ion w i t h 
fu r the r l ibe ra l iza t ion measures (pa r t icu la r ly in energy, telecommunications and agriculture) and 
strengthening o f the r o l e o f independent regu la to ry bodies t o im p r o v e the c l ima te f o r p r iva te 
investment; and (v) strengthening o f social assistance t o he lp l ow . income groups adversely 
affected b y the crisis. 

3 . 

Just when the program began to show initial signs of recove ry in the summer of 
2001, the economy was hit by an external shock after September 11, 2001. A l though 

Tu rkey ’s f inanc ia l markets q u i c k l y regained the g round lost, this was due in la rge pa r t t o inves to r 
expectations that the coun t ry w o u l d bene f i t f r o m add i t iona l support f r o m o f f i c i a l creditors t o 

-4- 

he lp overcome the negative effects o f the shock. Tu rkey ended 2001 s t i l l ve ry vulnerable t o 
external events and w i t h deep cuts in output, emp loymen t and income . F o l l o w i n g a n om i n a l 
devaluation o f some 50 percent in February 2001, the exchange rate s tab i l ized by the end o f the 
year. Interest rates were b rough t down, but they rema ined high in rea l t e rm s . The comb ina t ion 
o f high rea l interest rates, a large devaluation, the huge f isca l cost o f bank res t ruc tu r ing and deep 
recession caused the stock o f pub l ic debt t o r ise s ign i f ican t ly . The r a t i o o f ne t pub l ic debt t o 
GNP increased f r o m 58 percent at the end o f 2000 t o about 95 percent o f GNP b y the end o f 
2001. A serious d rough t exacerbated the recession w i t h ag r icu l tu ra l ou tpu t con t rac t ing by some 
6 percent. Ove ra l l , output shrank by mo re than 9 percent in 2001 and the o f f i c i a l unemp loymen t 
rate increased f r o m 6.6 percent t o 8.5 percent. 
In response, the authorities tightened 
macroeconomic po l ic ies fu r the r and attempted t o accelerate r e f o rm imp lemen ta t ion w i t h stepped 
up support f r o m the I F I s . 

T h e economy recovered strongly during 2002 despite con t inu ing vo lat i l ity in the 

4. 
f inanc ia l ma rke ts . GNP g r ow t h reached 7.8 percent, m o r e than doub le the o r ig ina l target o f 3 
percent, a l though pe r capita GNP in current U S $ t e rm s in 2002 rema ined 17 percent be low the 
1998 peak (F igu re 1). T h e strong g row th performance was due in part t o base effects f r o m the 
recession and stock building. Howeve r , there was also a pos i t ive story o n exports and tou r ism 
w h i c h responded t o the rea l exchange rate adjustment f o l l ow i n g the 2001 crisis. A rebound in 
ag r icu l tu ra l ou tpu t estimated at 7 
percent was another factor. A sharp 
increase 
in government absorption 
d r iven by p re -e lec t ion 
spending 
p layed an impo r tan t r o l e in sustaining 
demand in the second h a l f o f the year. 
Howeve r , p r iva te consump t ion also 
started t o recove r and the 
f a l l in 
p r iva te inves tmen t was reversed in the 
last quarter. End -yea r C P I i n f l a t i o n

The Government has shown a renewed commitment to economic reform after 

some initial delays. The economic p rog ram continues t o r e s t o n the three-pronged strategy 
articulated in response t o the 2001 crisis: (i) tight f isca l and mone ta ry po l ic ies unde rp inned b y

macroeconomic s tab i l i ty , and increased emphasis o n the p ro tec t ion o f the mos t vulnerable 
groups o f society. This strategy and the specific actions t o be comp le ted by the end o f 2003 are 
presented in de ta i l in the Government’s Urgent A c t i o n P lan adopted in January. Progress in 
imp lemen t ing the U rgen t A c t i o n P lan began in earnest w i t h the passage in April o f a fu l l -yea r

announced an ambitious p r iva t iza t ion p rog ram and proceeded t o launch a series o f tenders.

T h e Government ’s p r o g r am sets amb it ious targets f o r the nex t two years. K e y 

p rog ram targets inc lude economic g r ow t h o f 5 percent in 2003 and 2004 (see Tab le 1) and 
i n f l a t i o n f a l l i n g further t o 20 percent by the end o f 2003 and 12 percent in 2004. The p rog ram 
aims t o ensure sustainability o f the p u b l i c debt th rough a comb ina t ion o f economic growth, 
sustained f isca l adjustment and im p r o v e d inves to r confidence. T h e p r im a r y surplus o f the

in April and the fifth rev iew was comp le ted in August 2003. B a n k assistance has also been 
substantial. Since 2000, the B a n k has disbursed US$2.5 b i l l i o n in qu ick -d isbu rs ing lend ing and 
an add i t iona l US$0.5 b i l l i o n o f such assistance i s available f o r disbursement. The Government

11. WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED 

The unsustainable build-up in public debt and banking sector liabilities led 

11. 
ultimately to the 2001 cr is is . Based o n economic indicators, the last f i v e years i s a pe r iod when 
Turkish incomes rema ined on average unchanged, and a series o f economic and na tu ra l crises 
devastated m a n y people’s l ives . But l o o k i n g f r o m a longe r perspective, this pe r iod can be seen 
as the inev i tab le outcome o f rapid, unsustainable expansion fue led in part by excessive 
government overspending and l a x p u b l i c oversight. With the crises came the oppo r tun i ty f o r 
dea l ing m o r e systematically w i t h the u n d e r l y i n g problems, and establishing mode rn economic 
and social ins t i tu t ions f o r the 2 l S t century. T o this end, the Bank ’s assistance p rog ram has been 
shaped by t w o ove r r id ing objectives: (i) t o he lp Tu rkey m i t iga te the impac t o f these crises-- 
f inanc ia l and tectonic--on i t s people, and (ii) t o support the mode rn iza t ion and strengthening o f 
ins t i tu t ions f o r the future. 

12. 

The CAS fo r FY01-03 was initially undertaken at a time o f opportunity fo r 
structural reform, building on measures taken in late 1999 and early 2000. The Govemmen t 

had declared i t s comm i tmen t t o extensive reforms, and had enacted several impo r tan t laws 
despite the d is rup t ion o f the Ma rma ra and D u z c e earthquakes in August and Novembe r 1999, 
respectively. An IMF p rog ram was i n i t i a t e d in December 1999, and the ERL was approved b y 
the B a n k in M a y 2000. At the t im e the C A S was be ing d rawn up w i t h the Government, a 
p rog ram o f investment loans in support o f ins t i tu t iona l changes t o buttress the structural r e f o rm 
p o l i c y measures o f the ERL, and a F inanc ia l Sector Ad jus tmen t Loan, were be ing prepared. The 
B a n k h a d he lped l a y the g roundwo rk f o r extensive re fo rms th rough economic and sector w o r k 
and an ac t ive dialogue, fac i l i ta ted b y the m o v e o f the Coun t ry D i r e c t o r t o the f i e l d in 1998 and 
the subsequent strengthening o f the field-based economic management, human development, and 
p o r t f o l i o imp lemen ta t ion teams. 

13. 

The CAS was discussed by the Board in December 2000, as the financial market 
turbulence experienced by Turkey in November 2000 was fresh in the minds of observers. 

The Government made an e f fo r t t o restore the momen tum o f r e f o rm after the Novembe r 2000

the B o a r d in J u l y 2001, at w h i c h t im e the severe need f o r deeper r e f o rm h a d been made clear and 
the Government’s resolve had f i rmed . T h e B a n k was pos i t ioned t o support immed ia te ly the

were added t o the rev ised C A S t o support the mos t impo r tan t and urgent o f the re fo rms . These

Box 1: The Achievements and Remaining Agenda 

The re forms have b rough t about some las t ing changes, in par t icu lar where the suppor t ing ins t i tu t iona l changes 
have been made. V i ew i n g each o f the o r ig ina l C A S thrusts, the areas in w h i c h the aims have been rea l ized and 
where mo re attention i s needed du r ing the new C A S pe r iod can be assessed. The Retrospective Rev iew in 
Annex A2 prov ides a de ta i led assessment o f r e f o rm imp lemen ta t ion supported b y the B a n k program du r ing the 
past C A S per iod . 

Implement reforms for growth and employment generation. S ign i f ican t re forms have been made inc lud ing 
clean-up o f the bank ing system; enhanced regu la t ion in the banking, energy and telecommunications sectors; and 
reduc t ion o f agr icu l tura l subsidies w i t h the para l le l in t roduc t ion o f targeted income support f o r farmers. 
However, pressure t o reverse some o f these measures must b e resisted. M o r e r a p i d progress i s needed o n 
pr iva t iza t ion and the FDI agenda. 

Improve public management and accountability. Ra t iona l iza t ion o f pub l ic investment, e l im ina t ion o f most 
extra-budgetary funds and automation o f pub l ic accounting are so l id achievements. The adoption o f a new 
Pub l ic Deb t Management L a w and the creation o f the M i d d l e O f f i c e fo r D e b t Management have set the stage fo r 
more e f fec t ive management o f pub l ic l iab i l i t ies . Enactment o f the new procurement l aw and establishment o f 
the independent Pub l ic Procurement Agency constitute a key improvemen t in f isca l transparency; but vigorous 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the new pub l ic procurement f ramewo rk must be ensured. Enactment o f the Special 
Consumption Tax and r e f o rm o f the income tax are the first steps towards a mo re equitable and supportive tax 
system. L o o k i n g forward , fur ther progress o n pub l ic f inanc ia l management and i n i t i a t i o n o f mun ic ipa l r e f o rm 
w i l l be impor tan t . 

Expand social services and social protection. Substantial, sustainable improvemen ts have been made in basic 
education. Targe t ing has imp roved f o r social welfare f o r the poorest, but the system needs mo re fund ing and a 
stronger ins t i tu t iona l framework . A second stage social security r e f o rm i s needed to ra t iona l ize the ins t i tu t iona l 
framework, extend coverage and restore f inanc ia l balance. Hea l th outcomes rema in poo r fo r a m idd le income 
country, par t icu lar ly fo r maternal mo r ta l i ty . 

Strengthen environmental management and disaster mitigation. In env ironmen ta l management, successes 
have been dramatic and sustainable where achieved, but na t iona l rep l ica t ion o f reg iona l successes i s no t yet 
tak ing place. F o r disaster m i t iga t ion , despite the excellent results in recons truc t ion after the earthquakes o f 1999 
and i n i t i a l l y successful launch o f a na t iona l catastrophic insurance pool, the ins t i tu t iona l framework f o r disaster 
preven t ion remains weak. 

14. 
The achievements during the CAS implementation period we re made possible in 
part due to a three-pronged approach. First, new loans have been la rge (up f r o m an average 
size o f US$95 m i l l i o n in FY 9 4 - 9 7 t o US$440 m i l l i o n in FY98 -02 ) , but focused o n few strategic 
goals. Second, extensions o n o lde r loans not related t o the cu r ren t strategy have been 
discouraged. Third, tight adherence t o the strategy has im p r o v e d the Bank ’s a b i l i t y t o manage 
the p rog ram and w o r k towa rds shared goals w i t h the client. The Bank ’s a b i l i t y t o scale up has 
been built o n a bas is o f ana ly t ica l w o r k and dialogue. F o r example, the 2000 C E M l a i d ou t the 
need fo r re fo rms and ins t i tu t iona l changes to imp rove p r iva te sector development in agriculture, 
energy, p r iva t iza t ion , and telecommunications; w h i l e the PEIR, C P A R and C F A A l a i d the 
g roundwo rk f o r the P F P S A L operations. Tw i n n i n g adjustment operations w i t h investment has 
supported requ i red ins t i tu t iona l changes w i t h considerable techn ica l assistance to contribute t o 
the du rab i l i ty o f structural p o l i c y re fo rms . F o r example, the E x p o r t Finance In te rmed ia t ion L o a n 
helped bring f i v e p r iva te banks to w o r l d standards, w h i l e the F S A L and PFPSALs supported the 
strengthened regu la to ry env i ronmen t f o r banking.

Box 2: IFC’s Strategy Fo l low ing the 2001 Crisis 

IFC ’s strategy sh i f ted to respond to the pressing needs o f the corporate sector that was forced to adjust t o the 
effects o f the economic crisis. Consequently, IFC ’ s incremental 
investment approvals du r ing the year 2002 
were in the magnitude o f about US$300 m i l l i o n d ive rs i f ied amongst banks, a lum inum , paper, textiles, glass, 
tableware, electronics and ceramic products. 

W i t h regards the f inanc ia l sector, the I F C managed t o leverage i t s know ledge o f the f inanc ia l sector t o advise the 
Tu rk ish government in the res truc tur ing and rehab i l i ta t ion o f the bank ing sector du r ing the bank ing crisis. I n 
addition, the I FC has been assisting in the ins t i tu t iona l development o f banks, leas ing f inance companies, the 
reinsurance sector and in p r o v i d i n g I F C fund ing t o Sh4Es. 

A ma jo r focus o n the IFC ’ s investments was to enable i t s ex is t ing expor t-or ien ted c l ien ts to generate fo re ign 
exchange cash f lows t o service the ir debt, thereby avo id ing insolvency. In addition, the I F C also helped the 
g row th o f p rom is ing companies b y p r o v i d i n g them access to g loba l markets. 
IFC ’ s assistance was geared to 
enabling companies t o imp rove competitiveness and adapt t o in terna t iona l env ironmen ta l standards. I n add i t ion 
to trad i t iona l pro jec t finance, I F C also p rov ided wo rk ing cap i ta l finance and o n occasion, restored confidence in 
cred ib le operating enterprises b y rep lac ing anxious commerc ia l lenders. 

In general, the I F C has and w i l l con t inue to emphasize security arrangements f o r i t s c red i t to m in im ize 
d i f f icu l t ies w i t h regards recovery. The I F C has been extremely selective in i t s equ i ty investments as 
hype r in f la t ion and substantial deva lua t ion have l im i t e d opportunities f o r equ i ty /quas i-equ i ty investments. 
Ove ra l l however, the IFC ’ s p o r t f o l i o has managed to weather the vo la t i le economic env ironmen t o f recent years 
better than others.

T o summar ize , the p rev ious CAS represented a s ign if icant change in app roach 

wh i ch has impo r t an t lessons go ing f o r w a r d . A p rog ramma t ic approach, especially in the areas

comb ined w i t h tw i n n i n g o f adjustment and inves tmen t operations, e.g. in agriculture, energy, and 
p r iva t iza t ion , leveraged the impac t o f the Bank ’s ove ra l l p rog ram and ensured close links t o the 
r e f o rm process. Sca l ing up in a f ew focused l ines o f business--instead o f dispersing B a n k 
resources o n a la rge numbe r o f smaller interventions--ensured a s ign i f ican t and v is ib le 
development impac t in the coun t ry . A self-regulating program, w h i c h o f fe red T u r k e y substantial 
support ca re fu l ly ca l ib ra ted t o disburse o n the basis o f concrete r e f o rm imp lemen ta t ion and 
im p r o v e d macroeconomic outcomes, he lped manage r i s k s . 3 As the pace o f r e f o rm s lowed d ow n 
over the last year, so did too the Bank ’s f inanc ia l assistance. This support c o u l d be accelerated 
unde r the new CAS as the Gove rnmen t moves f o rw a r d in imp lemen t ing i t s r e f o rm program. 

O n l y one operation under the prev ious CAS , the PFPSAL I, has been rev iewed b y OED. The outcome o f the 
operation has been considered satisfactory. OED’s Eva lua t ion Summary o f the I C R rev iew notes as an impor tan t 
lesson o f broad app l icab i l i ty that “ imp lemen t ing f inanc ia l sector and pub l ic sector re forms concurren t ly y ie lds 
considerable benefit, in that establishing an imp roved f isca l s i tua t ion removes the ma jo r source o f the coun try ’s 
macroeconomic ins tab i l i ty and thereby lessens pressures o n the f inanc ia l sector”.

Desp i te impressive achievements over the past t w o decades, Tu rkey ’s economy has operated

Tu rkey has embarked o n a s ign i f ican t r e f o rm to address b o t h extreme pover ty and pove r ty mo re broad ly

(SRMP). 
Targe t ing the extremely poor fam i l ies w i t h children, the SRMP helps finance cond i t iona l cash transfers 
(CCT ) wh ich are cash payments t o mothers o f ex treme ly p o o r ch i ld ren p rov ided that they attend school and 
health c l in ics regu lar ly . A new targe t ing mechanism, a scoring fo rmu la (p roxy means test), has been 
developed based o n the 2001 household data. The cond i t iona l cash transfers are s ign i f ican t in that w h i l e 
modest in size, they are regular cash payments t o ex treme ly poo r fam i l ies to enable them to cover the ou t- 
o f-pocke t costs o f ge t t ing their ch i ld ren to school o r hea l th c l in ic . 
The SRMP also includes a social fund- type component, the L o c a l In i t ia t ives , w h i c h i s targeted towards 
vulnerable households. This builds o n an ex is t ing p rog ram o f sma l l income generating pro jec ts but w i t h

Turkey i s also imp rov ing i t s ins t i tu t ions f o r pove r ty mon i tor ing , SRMP mon i tor ing , and f o r social assistance 
and c h i l d welfare. Under the SRMP, par t o f the costs o f regular household income and expenditure surveys 
(H IES) are be ing financed, enabling Tu rkey to regu la r ly mon i to r pover ty . A H I E S was undertaken in 2002,

In 1999, the Ma rma ra earthquake caused extensive loss o f human l i f e and large

appropriate database and mon i to r ing mechanism, and the first comprehensive MDG Repor t fo r Tu rkey i s

assessment w i l l be rev ised once the results o f the UNDP - l e d e f fo r t become available. 

Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. The prevalence o f extreme pove r ty at $ Uday was l im i t e d to 1.8 percent 
o f the popu la t ion in 2001, dec l in ing f r om 2.4 percent in 1994. However , pove r ty mo re broad ly measured has 
increased f o l l ow i n g the 2001 crisis. As much o f this pove r ty i s shallow, the recovery o f 2002 should already

d i rec t ly inc lud ing the Soc ia l Risk M i t i g a t i o n Pro jec t approved in F Y 0 2 . 

Achieve universal pr imary education. N e t p r ima ry enro l lmen t ra te i s n ow close t o 100 percent. Tu rkey has 
achieved ma jor strides in extending the coverage o f p r im a r y education since 1997 when the compu lsory 8-year 
education system was introduced-now 
the Governmen t proposes t o increase this t o 12 years, pos ing an even 
larger f inanc ia l challenge. The Bank, through the Bas ic Educa t ion A P L s I. and II., i s con t r ibu t ing t o the success 
o f the Government’s e f for ts in this area. 

Promote gender equality and empower women. There remains a gender gap o f 15-20 percent in enro l lmen t 
rates o f g ir ls and boys in secondary education. W h i l e there have been improvemen ts du r ing the past few years 
in reduc ing this difference, e l im ina t ing gender d ispar i ty in secondary education b y 2015 w i l l be a challenge. 
The Bank- f inanced education projects have supported the faster increase in g ir ls ’ school enrollment, and the

Reduce child mortality. Unde r - f ive mo r ta l i ty rate i s h i g h at 45 o f 1,000 l i v e birth in 2000 but the steady 
improvemen t in the last decade holds promise f o r attainment o f the target o f reduc ing the under- f ive mo r ta l i ty 
rate b y tw o thirds between 1990 and 2015. 

Zmprove materna l health. A l though data i s scarce, maternal mo r ta l i ty rates are h i g h and the target f o r this 
MDG, i.e. the reduc t ion o f the maternal mo r ta l i ty ra te b y three quarters between 1990 and 2015 m i g h t b e 
d i f f i c u l t to meet. Th rough imp rov ing g ir ls ’ education, better access t o services and targeted hea l th sector

the authorities’ e f for ts t o reduce c h i l d and maternal mo r ta l i ty . 

Combat HZV/AZDS, ma la r ia and other diseases. There were 1,000 registered H I V / A I D S cases in 2000. In 
v iew o f the l o w base, the target o f ha l t ing the spread o f H I V / A I D S b y 2015 and beg inn ing to reverse i t thereafter 
may n o t be rea l is t ic . Turkey i s currently o n track o n the MDG target related to the incidence o f tuberculosis. 
The recen t ly completed health sector repor t (Turkey : R e f o rm i n g the Hea l th Sector fo r Imp roved Access and 
E f f ic iency , June 2002) provides a detailed rev iew o f Turkey ’s MDG status. 

Ensure environmental sustainability. The percentage o f peop le served w i t h imp roved water supply reached 83 
percent in 2000, an increase f r om 80 percent in 1990. W h i l e the trend i s improv ing , i t i s d i f f i c u l t t o judge 
whether the target o f ha lv ing the p ropo r t ion o f peop le w i thou t sustainable access to safe d r i n k i n g water b y 2015 
w i l l be met. The r u r a l sector study w i l l rev iew the water supply s i tua t ion in r u r a l areas. The planned M u n i c i p a l 
R e f o rm and Services operation cou ld contribute t o better access t o safe d r i n k i n g water in urban areas, and cou ld 
also imp rove the l ives o f slum dwellers. The Ana to l ia M i c r o Watershed Project should he lp address na tura l

Risks a n d m i t iga t ing measures. Tu rkey ’s r e f o r m p r o g r a m entails s ign if icant 
risks, as witnessed b y developments ove r the past two years, wh ich can on ly b e overcome 
b y sustained imp lemen ta t ion o f the re fo rms . T h e s i tua t ion in Tu rkey has been and w i l l 

con t inue t o be subject t o continued unce r ta in ty as events u n f o l d o n the ground. T h e three m a i n 
risk factors are: 

the con t inu ing macroeconomic vu lne rab i l i t ies arising f r o m fundamen ta l structural 
problems, the con t inu ing impac t o f the 2001 crisis, and in te rna t iona l and reg iona l 
developments; 
a po ten t ia l loss o f consensus f o r p o l i t i c a l o r social reasons s temm ing f r o m the social 
impac t o f re fo rms ; and 
ins t i tu t iona l challenges in imp lemen t ing the p rog ram .

Mac roeconom ic risks. T h e main macroeconom ic risk i s the po ten t ia l f o r m a r k e t 
confidence in the c red ib i l i ty o f the r e f o r m p r o g r a m to weaken wh ich cou ld l e ad to h ighe r 

interest rates th an in the p r o g r am baseline. H igh rea l interest rates w o u l d s low the recovery, 
nega t ive ly a f fec t p u b l i c debt sustainability and create the cond i t ions f o r renewed ins tab i l i ty . 
Sus ta inab i l i ty o f the pub l ic debt i s c r i t ica l t o mac roeconom ic s tab i l i ty and the u l t ima te success o f 
the r e f o rm program. Unde r the program, the p u b l i c debt t o GNP r a t i o (net o f C B T ne t assets), 
w h i c h f e l l f r o m 95 percent o f GNP in 2001 t o some 80 percent in 2002, i s n o w p ro jec ted t o f a l l 
fu r the r t o about 7 0 percent in 2003 (see Tab le 5) in pa r t due t o the unexpectedly s t rong L i r a . The 
debt bu rden i s p ro jec ted t o f a l l t o about 6 6 percent o f GNP in 2004. Ex tend ing the p rog rammed 
trends f o r the k e y macroeconomic parameters ( inc lud ing growth, interest rates and the p r im a r y 
surplus) until 2006 results in a fu r the r steady dec l ine in the pub l ic debt t o GNP r a t i o t o the 60 
percent range. Rea l iz ing this outcome hinges o n sustained recovery, a f a l l in rea l interest rates, 
and a sustained primary surplus o f 6.5 percent o f GNP. I t also depends o n s tab i l i ty o f the rea l 
exchange rate at o r near current levels. W h i l e the strong L i r a has unde rp inned the f a l l in 
i n f l a t i o n and decline in the pub l ic debt ra t io , the extent o f the exchange rate app rec ia t ion and 
current account d e f i c i t that have accompanied the recove ry has generated add i t iona l sources o f 
macroeconomic r i s k . 

69. 
A sensitivity analysis o f the pub l ic deb t dynam ics demonstrates the c en t r a l ro le o f 
c red ib le policies to build confidence and deepen the fiscal ad justment . T h e l e v e l and 

structure o f Tu rkey ’s pub l ic debt leave the Treasury’s b o r r ow i n g p rog ram vu lne rab le t o a 
po ten t ia l loss o f ma rke t confidence. The short average ma tu r i ty o f the domestic debt leads t o 
high m o n t h l y r o l l o v e r requirements. 
F o r e i g n exchange exposure i s another 
impo r tan t 
determinant. Tu rkey ’s crisis response p r o g r am has featured debt swaps by the Treasury t o 
e l im ina te the excess open FX pos i t ion o f the banks, together w i t h increased FX a n d F X - l i n k e d 
bo r row ing . As a resu l t , the share o f FX and F X - l i n k e d debt in the to ta l p u b l i c debt stock has 
r isen sharply. Mo reove r , a high p ropo r t ion o f the domestic debt i s in f loa t ing rate notes w h i c h 
increases exposure t o interest rate movements. F i n a l l y , a ve ry substantial share o f Tu rkey ’s 

-35- 

public debt i s t o p re fe r red creditors. T o i l lus t ra te the r i s k s , a low -case scenario can be 
fo rmu la ted where the p o l i t i c a l w i l l t o strengthen the f isca l p rog ram fa l te rs and the p r ima ry 
surplus does n o t exceed the 4 percent o f GNP rea l ized in 2002. As a result, rea l in te res t rates 
could be in the 2 0 percen t range, i.e., w e l l above the p ro jec ted p r o g r am path. T h e recovery 
w o u l d be expected t o fa l te r under the bu rden o f sustained high rea l interest rates w i t h g row th 
f a l l i n g short o f the 5 percent target f o r 2003 and s low ing fu r the r in 2004. A s l ow d ow n in the 
recove ry and deterioration in the p u b l i c debt dynamics c o u l d lead t o renewed cap i ta l account 
ou t f lows and exchange rate ins tab i l i ty w h i c h w o u l d exacerbate the im p a c t o n the debt burden. 
U n d e r these conditions, the p ro jec ted decline in the debt t o GNP r a t i o in 2003 c o u l d f a i l t o 
ma te r ia l ize and the p u b l i c debt bu rden c o u l d beg in t o increase in 2004. This analysis 
underscores the c r i t i c a l need for the Gove rnmen t t o strengthen the f i s c a l p r o g r am and establish 
i t s r e f o rm credentials firmly.

The active support of the IFI’s w i l l continue to be instrumental in helping Tu rkey 
address the risks and pursue i t s re fo rm program. The econom ic recove ry and d is in f la t ion 
progress achieved s ince early 2002 p rov ide encouragement that the excep t iona l support f r o m the 
I F I s has helped Turkey weather the impac t o f the 2001 c r is is w h i l e ma in ta in ing i t s r e f o rm 
course. The new Government’s stated comm i tmen t t o the p r o g r am demonstrates that p o l i t i c a l 
support f o r economic r e f o rm in T u r k e y transcends specific p o l i t i c a l parties and personalities. 
Howeve r , the Gove rnmen t w i l l be con t inuous ly cha l lenged by the need t o imp lemen t a l o n g l i s t 
o f difficult and soc ia l ly p a i n f u l re fo rms in a con tex t o f pressure f o r popu l is t measures and special 
interest lobby ing . The i r reve rs ib i l i ty o f the structural re fo rms put in place since 1999 cannot be 
taken f o r granted and the near-term r i s k s r em a i n s ign i f ican t given the depth o f Turkey’s 
economic vu lne rab i l i t ies and extent o f the re fo rms tha t lay ahead. In recognition o f the situation, 
the Bank ’s assistance strategy incorporates significant m i t i g a t i o n measures, in pa r t icu la r 
disbursements under adjustment lend ing w i l l con t inue to be c lose ly linked t o actual progress in 
r e f o rm imp lemen ta t ion as pe r the p rev ious C A S . 

IBRD Exposure 

77. 
With the sharp increase in IBRD lending, since 2000, which reversed a period of 
decline over the last ten years, Tu rkey i s becoming a n increasingly large p a r t o f the IBRD 
portfolio. Howeve r , this increase has been ca re fu l ly managed and the Bank ’s response has been 
closely linked to fundamental reforms. Wa ive rs unde r adjustment operations have been 
consistently avo ided and disbursements have been s t r ic t ly t i e d to the actual imp lemen ta t ion o f 
agreed p o l i c y actions. M o v i n g forward, management o f exposure with the same ca re fu l link t o 
re fo rms w h i c h w i l l imp rove Turkey’s creditworthiness w i l l con t inue t o be a high p r i o r i t y . 

78. 
Unde r the h igh case lending program, IBRD debt outstanding and disbursed 
(DOD) would increase to about US$8.2 b i l l ion in 2006. This w o u l d represent about 7.5 
percent o f the IBRD po r t fo l io , up f r o m 3.0 percent in 2000. F i n a n c i a l markets perceive T u r k e y 
as a risky coun t ry , as seen in the large premium o n Turkish do l la r Eu robonds over LIBOR. 
Add i t iona l ly , T u r k e y has a high external debt bu rden w i t h a debt service ra t io in the 40 percent 
range. As shown in Tab le 7, debt service t o p re fe r red c red i to rs as a share o f external p u b l i c debt 
service i s expected t o reach about 34 percent, w h i l e IBRD debt service as a percentage o f expo r ts 
o f goods and services w i l l rema in modest at 1.5 percent in 2006. 

79. 
B an k lending envisaged in this CAS fo r FY04 -06 would amount to US$4.5 b i l l ion 
in the h igh case and US$1.3 billion in the low case. This compares t o the C A S Progress 
Repo r t l e n d i n g p rog ram f o r FY 0 1 - 0 3 o f US$6.2 b i l l i o n in the high case, i n c l u d i n g US$1 .2 
b i l l i o n o n Special Structural Ad jus tmen t L o a n (SSAL ) conditions, and U S $ l b i l l i o n in the base 
case. In this CAS , under the high case scenario, IBRD D O D at i t s peak (US$8.2 b i l l i o n ) w o u l d 
be w e l l b e l ow the l e v e l p ro jec ted under the C A S Progress Repo r t (US$9.2 b i l l i o n ) . I f Tu rkey ’s

Annex A 1 

In t roduc t ion 

1. 
A cen t ra l ob jec t ive o f the Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS ) i s t o assist in 
reduc ing Tu rkey ’s economic vu lne rab i l i ty as i t strives t o achieve the goa l o f high and 
stable econom ic g row th . The p r iva te sector has an essential r o l e t o p l a y in generating this 
stable econom ic env i ronmen t and i t i s w i t h i n this con tex t that the p r iva te sector strategy 
(PSS) shou ld b e considered. Tu rkey ’s development strategy requires the creation o f an 
enab l ing env i ronmen t f o r p r iva te sector development t o boost g row th , emp loymen t 
creation and assist the coun t ry in tak ing advantage o f i t s un ique geographical location, i t s 
large domestic market, and accession plans w i t h the European U n i o n (EU). 

2. 

Desp i te the d i f f icu l t ies o f years o f macroeconomic ins tab i l i ty , high rea l interest 
rates, the l i m i t e d ava i lab i l i ty o f l o n g te rm credit, an i n e f f i c i e n t regu la to ry environment, 
and the dominance o f state owned enterprises 
in economic ac t iv i ty , Tu rkey ’s 
entrepreneurial p r iva te sector has taken advantage o f the oppo r tun i t ies available, 
pa r t icu la r ly in terms o f expo r t o r ien ta t ion and reg iona l expansion. W h i l e large 
companies con t inue t o dominate p roduc t ive activities, the sma l l and m e d i um size 
enterprise ( S M E ) sector also has an impo r tan t r o l e t o p lay . This impo r tance o f the p r iva te 
sector in generating economic g r ow t h has been acknow ledged b y the Government, w i t h 
the focus inc reas ing ly o n im p r o v i n g Tu rkey ’s competitiveness and f a c i l i t a t i n g a business 
environment conduc ive t o p r iva te sector development and increased fo re ign direct 
investment. 

3. 

The PSS i s organized i n t o three sections: i) a desc r ip t ion o f the p r iva te sector and 
the current business environment, i n c l u d i n g imped imen ts t o p r iva te sector development; 
ii) a summary o f the Government’s strategy t o p romo te p r iva te sector development; and 
iii) an ou t l ine o f the W o r l d B a n k Group’s strategy geared towa rds the fu r the r 
development o f the p r iva te sector. 

Tu rkey ’s P r i v a t e Sector 

4. 
Tu rkey ’s p r iva te sector has a m a j o r r o l e t o p l a y in the fu tu re g row th and 
development o f the coun t ry . T h e po ten t ia l f o r p r iva te sector development i s based o n the 
f o l l ow i n g factors: i) Tu rkey ’s strategic loca t ion between the fo rme r Sov ie t Un ion , the 
Balkans, Cen t ra l A s i a and the M i d d l e East; ii) Tu rkey ’s w e l l deve loped and v ib ran t 
entrepreneurial culture; iii) a la rge domestic market; iv ) an open economy; and v) strong 
ties t o the EU (bo th th rough the customs u n i o n and discussions o n EU accession). 

5 . 

Tu rkey ’s economic development has su f fe red f r o m g loba l and domestic crises, 
most recently the 2001 f inanc ia l crisis. As a result, p r iva te sector development remains 
be low i t s po ten t ia l and b e l ow leve ls seen in fast g r ow i n g deve lop ing countries. There are 
a number o f factors that have and con t inue t o impede p r iva te sector g row th . These 
inc lude i) macroeconomic ins tab i l i ty ; ii) f inanc ia l sector weakness; iii) consequent l o w 

2 

leve ls o f fo re ign direct investment; i v ) a la rge p u b l i c debt burden lead ing t o high rea l 
interest rates and a c rowd ing ou t o f p r iva te borrowers; v) a regu la to ry env i ronmen t and 
bureaucracy that i s n o t conducive t o a t t rac t ing necessary p r iva te investment; and v i ) 
issues su r round ing corporate governance. Progress has been made ove r recent years t o 
address these issues , fac i l i ta t ing imp rovemen ts in the business env i ronmen t and renewed 
oppo r tun i t ies f o r a dynamic p r iva te sector.

2000/2001 Crisis and Economic Impact: T h e cumu la t ive effects o f the crises 

end ing with the February 2001 c r is is were f e l t th roughou t the economy - starting in the 
p u b l i c sector, spreading t o the f inanc ia l sector and causing increasing distress in the rea l 
sector. The c r is is hit S M E s especially hard. T h e unce r ta in macroeconomic env i ronmen t

t o 17.2% in 2002. S im i la r evidence can be f o u n d in p r iva te sector f i x e d cap i ta l fo rma t ion 
data, w h i c h f e l l by a third as a share o f GNP, f r o m a lmos t 20% o f GNP in 1993 t o 11.3% 
o f GNP in 2002. P r iva te investment in the hous ing sector decreased in importance during 
the 1990s (housing accounted f o r 21.6% o f to ta l p r iva te investment in 2002, d ow n f r o m 
ove r 40% in the ea r ly 1990s). 
Inves tmen t in indus t r ia l p roduc t ion (mining and 
manu fac tu r ing ) has rema ined la rge ly static as a share o f to ta l p r iva te investment during 
the la te 1990s and th rough t o 2002l. In add i t ion , p r iva te sector inves tmen t in energy and 
in f ras t ruc tu re has remained l o w (see Tab le 1). W h i l e macroeconomic unce r ta in ty has 
been a dom inan t fac to r in inves tmen t decisions during recent years, the strong ro le p layed 
by the state in indus t ry and in particular, in f ras t ruc tu re development, has fu r the r l i m i t e d

the im p r o v i n g regu la to ry env i ronmen t (as T u r k e y l o o k s towards EU accession) and the 
increased focus o n p r iva t iza t ion o f state econom ic enterprises, the po ten t ia l f o r increased

The structure o f Tu rkey ’s expo r t sector has been shifting ove r recent years. 
Expo r ts o f f o o d and beverages have shown a sizeable decline, w h i l e exports o f 
chemicals, textiles, plastics and m in ing - re la ted products have increased s ign i f ican t ly o n 
an annual basis. In fact, the share o f ag r icu l tu ra l products in to ta l p roduc t exports shrank

The CAS fo r FY01-03 was undertaken at a time of opportunity for structural 
reform, bu i ld ing on in i t ia l measures taken i n late 1999 and early 2000. The 

Government, f o l l ow i n g i t s en t ry i n t o o f f i c e in the spring o f 1999, h a d declared a 
comm i tmen t t o extensive reforms, and had enacted several impo r tan t l aw s despite the 
d is rup t ion o f the Ma rma ra and D u z c e earthquakes in August and Novembe r 1999, 
respectively. An IMF p rog ram was in i t ia ted in December 1999, and the Econom ic

The CAS was discussed w i t h the Board in December 2000, as the f inanc ia l market

The achievements during the CAS implementation pe r iod were made possible in 

pa r t due to a three-pronged approach: new loans have been large (up f r o m an average 
size o f US$95 m i l l i o n in FY94-97 t o US$440 m i l l i o n in FY98-02) but focused o n f ew 

6 

strategic goals; extensions o n o lde r loans n o t re la ted t o the current strategy have been 
resisted; and tak ing advantage o f tight adherence t o our strategy has im p r o v e d ou r a b i l i t y 
t o manage as w e l l as w o r k towards shared goals w i t h the c l ien t . O u r a b i l i t y t o scale up 
was in turn predicated upon a basis o f ana ly t ica l w o r k and dialogue; f o r example, the 
C E M o f 1999 l a i d ou t the need f o r re fo rms and ins t i tu t iona l changes t o im p r o v e p r iva te 
sector development in agriculture, energy, p r iva t iza t ion , and telecommunications, w h i l e 
the PEN, C P A R and C F A A l a i d the g roundwo rk f o r the P F F S A L series. Tw i n n i n g

w i t h considerable technical assistance t o con t r ibu te t o the du rab i l i ty o f s t ruc tu ra l p o l i c y

banks t o w o r l d standards, w h i l e the F S A L and PFPSALs supported the strengthened 
regu la to ry environment.

Due to the many po l i t ica l issues involved fo r any govemment to implement 
sweeping structural reforms in times of economic vo la t i l i ty , i t is important to be poised 
opportunistically to support openings as they arise. The B a n k p rog ram succeeded in this 

respect because intensive E S W was available t o p rov ide guidance f o r re fo rms as they 
became feasible, and the dialogue o n these issues was kep t strong th rough s ign i f ican t 
f i e l d presence and strategic techn ica l assistance. 

Despite the achievements du r ing the CAS period, there are vulnerabilities in 

7 . 
Turkey’s development prospects. There i s “ re fo rm fatigue”. The n ew government, 
whose e lec t ion was an expression o f a desire f o r change, does n o t w i s h t o replicate the 
p rog ram o f i t s predecessor and faces large demands f o r popu l is t measures. Pove r ty has 
r isen and there i s n o t yet a coherent approach t o p ro -poo r development. 
T h e 
Government’s urge t o assist the econom ica l ly vulnerable 
i s man i fes ted th rough 
discussion o f such poss ib i l i t ies as new crop-based subsidies, ag r icu l tu ra l debt w r i te -o f fs , 
i n i t i a t i n g universal hea l th insurance, and ra is ing pension payments, but the f isca l cost and 
risk o f weak targeting w i t h such measures must also be considered.

Reflecting the p r io r i t ies se t in the CAS and the CAS PR, the portfolio 's emphasis 
has shifted towards supporting the Govemment 's reform p rog ram w i t h adjustment loans 
and higher lending in sectors where structural reforms can be supported w i t h investment 
projects such as ru ra l development and social protection. As o f June 2003, 29 percent o f

Box 1: C l ien t Survey 

In summer 2002, over 200 stakeholders par t ic ipa ted in a c l ien t survey to p rov ide v iews o n the Bank ’s 
assistance to the country. Some 44 percent o f the respondents worked f o r the central government 
w h i l e the rest o f the participants represented a var ie ty o f groups, such as the media, academia, NGOs, 
donors, the p r iva te sector and l o c a l administrations. Some o f the h igh l igh ts , based o n the responses 
p rov ided b y the participants o f the survey, are summarized be low : 

Perceived ove ra l l value o f the Bank in Tu r k e y 

Most impo r tan t : f inanc ia l resources, resource mob i l iza t ion , fac i l i ta t ion 
Relatively less impor tan t : lend ing when others w i l l not, p o l i c y advice, and the Bank ’s know ledge 

A reas where the Bank should be involved 

Most impo r tan t : encouraging greater transparency in governance and safeguarding against co r rup t ion 
in projects, c lose ly fo l lowed b y strengthening the f inanc ia l sector, b r i n g i n g about economic g row th 
and strengthening the education sector 
Relatively less impor tan t : im p r o v i n g the j u d i c i a l system, strengthening the pub l ic sector, and ensuring 
that attention i s p a i d t o gender disparities 

Specific areas o f effectiveness 

Most effective: 

imp rov ing the regu la tory framework , strengthening the f inanc ia l sector, and 
safeguarding against corrup t ion in projects 
Relatively less effective: imp rov ing the j u d i c i a l system, reduc ing pover ty , and strengthening the hea l th 
sector 

The results o f the c l ien t survey suggests a need t o (i) make the Bank ’s p o l i c y advice and know ledge 
transfer even mo re relevant t o Turkey ’s par t icu lar circumstances; (ii) increase the effectiveness o f 
B a n k support fo r pover ty reduction, and disseminate in fo rma t ion mo re w ide ly o n these efforts; and 
(iii) imp rove the e f f ic iency o f B a n k assistance in the hea l th sector. 

Lessons f o r th e F u t u r e 

There are benefits to a scaled-up and tightly focused program. This approach 

concentrates e f fo r t and funding f o r each o f the l i m i t e d numbe r o f strategic p r io r i t ies . 
Because i t imp roves the a b i l i t y t o commun ica te and c l a r i f y t o the c l ien t and ins ide the 
B a n k wha t the objectives o f ou r w o r k are, a focused p rog ram eases j o i n t w o r k and makes 
the Bank ’s e f fo r ts mo re comprehensible t o o the r partners. 

Nevertheless, this approach can lead to complex operations. A l though a f ew strategic 

objectives are agreed, and a sma l l numbe r o f la rge r operations designed f o r each, o f ten a 
la rge numbe r o f actions o n the ins t i tu t iona l f r o n t have t o be undertaken in a conce r ted 
w a y t o reach those objectives. This i s n o t a lways recogn ized in budge t ing and p l a n n i n g 

9 

f o r intensive supervision, but where i t has been p rope r ly resourced, i n c l u d i n g by the 
counterparts, i t i s successful. 

Comprehensive s t ruc tu ra l reform requires supporting ins t i tu t iona l changes, w h i c h i n t u r n 

take time. Thus i t has been impo r tan t n o t o n l y t o link ins t i tu t ion building inves tmen t 
loans t o p o l i c y based SALS, but also t o get a longe r te rm p rog ramma t ic approach, w i t h 
consistent objectives f o r mo re than a 2-3 year CAS p e r i o d t o make re fo rms permanent. 

Keeping p ro jec t implementation times shorter is impo r tan t t o a v o i d disproportionate 

e f fo r t by the B a n k t o supervise the t a i l end o f projects that are n o longe r a l igned with 
objectives o f a government d i f fe ren t f r o m the one that unde r took the p ro jec t o r ig ina l ly . 
The a b i l i t y t o p roac t ive ly restructure o r cancel parts o f loans i s v i t a l f o r a p rog ram that 
must respond t o changes o n the g round in uncertain and risky times. 

A n emerging lesson of experience i n the po r t fo l io i s the need t o press for legal and 
ins t i tu t iona l changes p r i o r t o p ro jec t implementation, if they a re impo r tan t fo r efSective

In order t o attract mo re fo re ign d irec t investment, par t ic ipan ts re fe r red to the necessary

With respect t o human development, par t ic ipan ts stressed the impor tance o f deve lop ing new

Coun t ry Gende r Assessment Summa ry 

A comprehensive gender assessment has been prepared by a group o f Turkish experts 
cove r ing ten areas t o re f lec t gender issues w i t h special relevance t o pove r ty : the lega l 
f ramewo rk ; education; health; labo r and social security; microenterprises; r u r a l women 
and pove r ty ; m ig ra t ion , pove r ty and social protection; state, po l i t ics and c i v i l society; 
v io lence against women; and disaster assistance (Turkey: Country Gender Assessment, 
draft, December 2002). B e l ow are excerpts f r o m the Conclusions o f the d ra f t report: 

“Reg iona l and ru ra l -u rban differences were relevant in a l l sectors (pa r t icu la r ly in 
education, health, labo r and social security, and violence) and they appeared t o 
compound gender d i f fe ren t ia ls . Mo reove r , n o t o n l y these t w o dimensions were highly 
ins t rumen ta l in ana lyz ing gender disparities, but they p roved t o be equa l ly s ign i f ican t in 
understanding pove r ty . As expected, highest leve ls o f gender inequa l i ty were f o u n d t o 
coex is t w i t h wo rs t cases o f pove r ty in the society. Gender disparities re f lec ted in 
women’s unfavorable pos i t ion get further m a g n i f i e d in a l l sectors in r u r a l as opposed t o 
u rban areas and in Eastern, Southeastern and B l a c k Sea regions, w h i c h also suffer f r o m 
deeper pove r ty . Ano the r striking observation was that the women in ‘second wave’ o f 
m ig ran ts experienced pronounced 
fo rms o f gender 
inequa l i ty w h i l e 
the m a j o r 
t rans fo rma t ion caused by this m i g r a t i o n in t roduced new faces o f pove r ty and d is rup ted 
ex is t ing social safety nets in u rban areas. 

[...I compa r ing de j u r e v. defacto dimensions o f gender equa l i ty also re f lec ted s ign i f ican t 
differences between the two . F o r instance, despite the C i v i l L a w p r o v i d i n g f o r equal 
inheritance and p rope r ty owne rsh ip rights f o r women and m e n since 1926, women are 
estimated t o ow n less than 10% o f ag r icu l tu ra l l a n d and about 9% o f u rban rea l estate. 

In light o f the analyses o f gender d ispa r i ty [ . ..I, three m a i n cross-cutting issues can be 
iden t i f ied . These constitute fundamental factors w h i c h are responsible f o r hampe r ing 
women ’s attainment o f equa l i ty w i t h men in Turkish society. T h e y are also inex t r icab ly 
l i n k e d t o poverty, since they re f lec t women’s inadequate access t o oppo r tun i t ies and 
capabilities o r i n a b i l i t y t o attain desirable leve ls o f security and empowe rmen t t o escape 
pove r ty . 

Econom ic dependence o f women emerges as a p r i m a r y p r o b l em a rea . I t i s re f lec ted 

in findings such as l o w and decreasing labo r pa r t ic ipa t ion rates o f women; the i r h ighe r 
u rban unemployment rates; rema rkab ly high p ropo r t ions as u n p a i d f am i l y workers; l ow e r 
average wages; high ra t ios in insecure jobs in the i n f o rm a l sector; d isp ropo r t iona te ly l o w 
owne rsh ip o f real estate; i n a b i l i t y t o p rov ide co l la te ra l as entrepreneurs in the d i f fe ren t 
sector analyses. 

L a c k o f skills as ref lected m a in l y b y educat ion a n d emp loymen t d a t a constitutes 
ano the r unde r ly ing force account ing f o r women’s d isadvantaged pos it ion in the 

society. I t i s no t o n l y demonstrated in women’s l ow e r leve ls o f l i te racy and education o r 

2 

r u r a l women’s l a c k o f access t o technology and machinery and u rban m i g r a n t women’s 
i n a b i l i t y t o jo in the fo rma l labor market, but also through the d i f f icu l t ies experienced by 
different groups o f women in accessing in fo rma t ion and services such as health, 
transportation, ban lung o r dealing w i t h bureaucracies. 

Traditional values and cultural stereotypes pose a major obstacle fo r women to 

attain equality with men. Re f lec t ions o f d isc r im ina to ry and deb i l i ta t ing t rad i t ions and 
gender stereotypes are observed in the who le range o f sectors rev iewed . Sex - typ ing o f 
occupations and gender-segregated labor markets; women p r im a r i l y de f ined as ‘care 
givers’ and m e n as ‘breadwinners’; women’s lack o f m o b i l i t y ; no t ions o f women’s 
outside w o r k being considered incompa t ib le marriage and mo the rhood are o n l y some 
examples o f such practices. Mo reove r , women’s exposure t o suppression and violence in 
the f am i l y and commun i ty i s o f ten leg i t im ized o n the basis o f t rad i t ions and culture that 
are in te rna l ized by women themselves t o func t ion as s e l f - l im i t i n g influences. [ . . . ] 
The analyses and recommendations [ . . . ] rega rd ing the measures needed t o combat gender 
inequa l i ty are also in fo rma t ive f o r pove r ty reduc t ion strategies. I n this context, targeting 
o f pove r ty assistance schemes t o vulnerable women (e.g., i l l i te ra te , n o n -w o r km g m ig ran t 
women o f the ‘second wave’; single m ig ran t women; female headed households; ru ra l 
older women) appears as the mos t obvious need f o r the short term. S im i la r ly , immed ia te 
attention i s requ i red t o devise measures (e.g., insurance coverage) t o reduce vu lne rab i l i ty 
o f unemp loyedun insu red women in r u r a l and u rban areas. 

Sho r t - te rm t o med ium - te rm measures are requ i red t o im p r o v e women’s capabilities and 
opportunities. In order t o address poverty, i n f o rm i n g r u r a l and u rban w om e n o f assistance 
and j o b poss ib i l i t ies , as w e l l as p r o v i d i n g k n ow - h ow and fac i l i ta t ing app l ica t ion f o r 
assistance and jobs p rom ise s ign i f ican t benefits f o r the vulnerable groups. W h i l e 
ne ighbo rhood and commun i ty so l ida r i ty ne two rks come across as impo r tan t safety nets 
f o r needy women, their po ten t ia l t o func t ion as social con t ro l agents o n women thereby 
impeding women’s long - te rm empowerment shou ld n o t be ove r looked . L i te racy and 
vocational t ra in ing o f women t o im p r o v e the i r chances o f emp loymen t in better pay ing 
and secure jobs can be p rov ided by state and c i v i l society agents, w i t h a v i ew t o p romo te 
women’s pa r t ic ipa t ion in unconven t iona l areas. O n the leg is la t ive f ron t , enactment o f 
equal oppo r tun i ty leg is la t ion as w e l l as leg is la t ion t o prevent sexual harassment and 
d isc r im ina t ion at the w o r k place; establishment o f new mechanisms (e.g., gender 
ombuds) t o m o n i t o r practices are deemed essential t o ensure gender equa l i ty in the labo r 
market. 

Comprehensive and coordinated e f fo r ts b y state, c i v i l society, and mass med ia as w e l l as 
international organizations need t o be expanded in the m e d i um - t o long - te rm t o 
e f fec t ive ly combat d isc r im ina to ry 
t rad i t ions and practices 
that 
impede women’s 
economic independence and perpetuate l o w status in the f a m i l y and commun i ty . To this 
end, sustained programs t o socialize and t ra in women and m e n in a ‘cu l tu re o f equality’ 
w i l l ensure imp rovemen t o f women ’s equal oppo r tun i t ies and empowerment.”

o f Accoun ts (TCA ) , wh ich reports t o Parliament; a re la t ive ly open system o f 
accoun tab i l i ty and p len ty o f s k i l l e d personnel. Howeve r , deeper analysis reveals 
s ign i f ican t p rob lems and lack o f systemic coherence. Comp lex ins t i tu t iona l relationships, 
m u l t i p l e sources o f public funds, heavy emphasis o n ex ante controls and inadequate 
repo r t ing t o the legislature reduce transparency and weaken f inanc ia l management. 
Accoun t ing and procurement leg is la t ion have n o t kep t up with e v o l v i n g in te rna t iona l

On April 15, 2002, the Execu t ive B o a r d o f the In te rna t iona l Mone ta ry Fund (IMF) conc luded the 
A r t i c l e I V consu l ta t ion w i t h Tu rkey . ’ 

B a c kg round 

T u r k e y i s in the midst o f a determined campa ign t o turn around decades o f weak performance. N o t 
o n l y has g r ow t h been o n a downwa rd t rend since the 1970s (and i n f l a t i o n o n an u pw a r d one), i t has 
also become inc reas ing ly vo la t i le . This performance re f lec ts pervasive structural r ig id i t ies , weak 
p u b l i c finances, and l o w p o l i c y c r e d i b i l i t y . Desp i te many achievements since the economic

d is in f la t ion attempts have h a d l i t t l e success. 

The past coup le o f years have witnessed three ma jo r attempts at addressing u n d e r l y i n g weaknesses. 
T h e first was during 2000 unde r the three-year Standby Agreement i n i t i a t e d in Decembe r 1999. The 
p rog ram ins t i tu ted strong f isca l adjustment and a preannounced exchange rate c r aw l t o restore debt 
sus ta inab i l i ty and t o break entrenched i n f l a t i o n expectations. The p r o g r am also i n c l u d e d a w ide -

in bank ing , social security, p r iva t iza t ion , and 
agriculture-to

in structural re fo rms , in turning around the p u b l i c sector p r im a r y balance, and i n r e i n i n g in in f la t ion , 
a wo rsen ing cu r ren t account and a f rag i le b a n k i n g system l e d in la te 2000 t o a liquidity c r is is w h i c h 
tu rned i n t o a f u l l - b l ow n crisis, w i t h a la rge loss o f reserves. P romp ted by p o l i t i c a l tensions, this was 
f o l l ow e d b y another speculative attack in Feb rua ry 2001, f o r c i n g the gove rnmen t t o f loa t the 
cu r rency amidst high interest rates and a renewed acceleration in i n f l a t i o n . 

T h e second phase was the adop t ion in M a y 2001 o f a strengthened p r o g r am a imed at res to r ing 
inves to r confidence b y addressing the roo ts o f the crises, w i t h the he lp o f add i t iona l IMF support.

The au tho r i t ies ’ rev ised p rog ram featured a fundamental res t ruc tu r ing o f the bank ing sector (a k e y 
source o f v u l n e r a b i l i t y in the past), a comm i tmen t to a f l o a t i n g exchange rate ( reduc ing vu lne rab i l i ty 
t o shocks), con t inued d is in f la t ion , substantial f isca l adjustment to underpin debt sustainability, and an 
enhanced r o l e f o r the p r iva te sector. Just as the rev ised p rog ram was beg inn ing t o show results, the 
events o f September I 1 t r igge red a deterioration in ma rke t sentiment and a re-emergence o f serious 
f inanc ing p rob lems . Meanwh i le , Tu rkey con t inued t o suffer f r o m an ine f f ic ien t p u b l i c sector, barriers 
t o p r iva te sector development, a bank ing sector damaged b y the earlier crises, and a h i g h p u b l i c debt 
burden, f u e l l e d in pa r t b y pub l ic ly - funded bank recapitalization. 

I n response t o September 11, the Turkish government in i t ia ted a new in tens i f ied IMF - s u p p o r t e d 
program, b o t h t o p ro tec t the economy against fu tu re crises, and to con t inue Tu rkey ’s amb i t ious 
re fo rm agenda. Under the 2002-04 program, the con t inua t ion o f the f loa t w i l l limit the po ten t ia l f o r 
speculative attacks. Ongo ing f inanc ia l sector r e f o rm together w i t h corporate sector res t ruc tu r ing w i l l 
help strengthen the b a n k i n g and business sectors, and con t inued f isca l d isc ip l ine shou ld foster 
med ium - te rm debt sustainability. The p rog ram ’s strong structural r e f o rm agenda should, once 
mac roeconom ic s tab i l iza t ion i s achieved, f i n a l l y se t the stage f o r sustained economic g row th . 

Deve lopmen ts under the new p rog ram have been p rom is ing . F inanc ia l ma rke t cond i t ions have 
im p r o v e d m a r k e d l y f r o m the i r post-September 11 lows ; the benchmark b i l l rate has fa l len sharply, 
and the Turkish l i r a has appreciated b y mo re than 20 percent t o around T L 1 .3 m i l l i o n t o the U . S . 
do l la r . Aga ins t this background, the trend towa rd do l la r iza t ion has d im in ished , and even shown signs 
o f reversal in recent months, the stock ma rke t has r i s e n b y over 50 percent in l i r a terms since m i d - 
September, and the r o l l - o f f o f external in te rbank credits has ceased. Sho r t - te rm concerns about the 
p u b l i c debt r o l l o v e r have also la rge ly abated, a l l ow i n g a leng then ing o f ma tu r i ty o f domestic debt 
and strong demand f o r new Eu robond i s s u e s . I n f l a t i o n has started t o decline, helping t o reduce 
in f la t ion expectations and a l l ow i n g the Cen t ra l B a n k o f T u r k e y ( C B T ) t o reduce the ove rn igh t ra te by 
14 po in ts ( to 66 percent) in three steps over the past t w o mon ths . 

A large numbe r o f p o l i c y measures have been taken unde r the new p rog ram . I n January, the 
authorities m e t m o r e than ten p r i o r actions in the f isca l and structural areas needed f o r the app rova l o f 
the SBA. Subsequently, a l l quan t i ta t ive performance c r i te r ia re levan t f o r the first rev iew were me t . 
Base money came in b e l ow the end-February ce i l ing , w h i l e N e t In te rna t iona l Reserves and N e t 
Domes t ic Assets targets were me t com fo r tab ly . T h e p u b l i c sector p r im a r y surplus target o f 
5 .5 percent o f GNP f o r 2001 was exceeded b y an estimated 0.4 percent o f GNP, and in January the 
consolidated gove rnmen t sector exceeded i t s p r im a r y surplus target com fo r tab ly . S o l i d progress has 
also been made in meeting the p rog ram ’s s t ruc tu ra l cond i t iona l i ty . 

E x e c u t i v e Board Assessment 

Execu t ive D i rec to rs we lcomed the Turkish authorities’ decisive e f fo r ts t o address the p rob lems o f the 
past and imp lemen t an amb i t ious economic r e f o rm p r o g r am t o l a y the basis f o r sustainable g row th . In 
the past, f inanc ia l ind isc ip l ine and structural weaknesses h a d p reven ted Tu rkey f r o m r e a l i z i n g i t s

barriers t o p r i v a t e sector development and a b a n k i n g sector damaged by the t w o recent crises. 
D i rec to rs w e l c om e d the Turkish authorities’ progress in addressing these weaknesses and reduce the 
v u l n e r a b i l i t y o f the economy t o shocks th rough the i r b o l d three-year p rog ram . They no ted that the 
p rog ram represents a fu r the r decisive step away f r o m the in te rven t ion is t po l ic ies o f the past, and that 
i t w o u l d l a y the g roundwo rk f o r a stronger performance in the future. 

In this regard, D i rec to rs commended the authorities f o r ma in ta in ing the pos i t ive m om e n t um o f

1 I. Mac roeconom ic po l ic ies have rema ined prudent; and the government has con t inued t o press

redundancies and the adop t ion o f the leg is la t ive basis f o r im p r o v e d p u b l i c debt management. T h e 
au tho r i t ies ’ e f fo r ts have been rewa rded by a substantial decline in interest rates, a s t rong balance o f 
payments p o s i t i o n w i t h an associated appreciation o f the Turkish l i ra , and a d rop in i n f l a t i o n and in 
in f la t ion expectations. 

D i rec to rs no ted that, w h i l e these pos i t ive results shou ld he lp l a y the basis f o r sustainable g row th , 
there are downs ide risks. In particular, they emphasized that the strength and t i m i n g o f the recove ry 
in ou tpu t are uncertain, and that f inanc ia l markets have remained alert to the p o s s i b i l i t y o f fu r the r 
shocks. D i rec to rs expressed concern that p ro longed s low economic g r ow t h w o u l d have an adverse 
impac t o n Tu rkey ’s debt sustainability. T o boos t g row th , they emphasized the impo r tance o f 
s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms to raise p r iva te inves tmen t and p roduc t iv i ty and to l ow e r real interest rates. 
D i rec to rs stressed that successful p rog ram imp lemen ta t ion in the months ahead w i l l requ i re the

D i rec to rs stressed that, a l though f isca l developments rema in o n track, s t r ic t budge t imp lemen ta t ion

ready t o take fu r the r o f fse t t ing measures t o safeguard the p r im a r y surplus target and m a i n t a i n 
ex te rna l debt sustainability. 

D i rec to rs no ted that, t o be sustainable, the achievement o f the ove ra l l budge t targets w i l l need t o be 
unde rp inned by decisive re fo rms . They were encouraged b y the government’s e f fo r ts t o im p r o v e
