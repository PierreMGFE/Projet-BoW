EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

A r g e n t i n a con t inues i t s r a p i d recove ry f r o m the economic and social c r is is o f 2001-2002. 
. E f f e c t i v e mac roeconom ic management, focused o n the generation o f p r im a r y f isca l surpluses, 
has he lped t o establish three years o f fast and p ro -poo r g row th . Pove r ty and unemp loymen t , 
w h i l e s t i l l high, have fallen substantially f r o m the peaks during the crisis. Progress has been 
ev iden t th roughou t the economy. On the p o l i t i c a l front, President K i r c h n e r fu r the r consolidated 
his buoyan t p o p u l a r support in the leg is la t ive elections o f October 2005. 

T h e f o u r years since the depth o f the c r is is have seen the outlines o f a new development agenda 
emerge in A rgen t ina , and the substantial re jec t ion o f that w h i c h p redom ina ted in the 1990s. T h e 
past two Gove rnmen ts have reacted t o l o n g standing social and economic p rob lems that we re 
exacerbated, and b rough t t o the fore, by the crisis, such as structural poverty, i n e q u a l i t y and deep 
soc ia l exc lus ion . While progress has been made towa rd establishing a c lea r ly de f ined p o l i c y 
f ramewo rk in ce r ta in sectors (health and education), such progress has yet t o b e achieved in o the r 
impo r tan t sectors, mos t notably, p u b l i c services. 

T h e current env i ronmen t presents A rgen t ina with impo r tan t opportunities, but also r i s k s . T h e 
oppo r tun i ty i s t o translate the fast recove ry and current p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty i n t o sustainable 
econom ic and soc ia l development f o r the l o n g t e rm . This w o u l d represent a s ign i f ican t b reak 
w i th the country’s h is to ry o f s l ow growth, recurrent c r is is and inc reas ing soc ia l exclusion. 
Con t inued p ruden t macroeconomic management w i l l require, 
in te r a l i a , sustained f isca l 
d isc ip l ine at the federal and p r o v i n c i a l levels. E q u a l l y impo r tan t i s a comm i tmen t t o s t ruc tu ra l 
reform, i n c l u d i n g in investment climate, ins t i tu t iona l strengthening, the r u l e o f law , and p u b l i c 
services, A rgen t ina can con t inue t o build o n the progress achieved in k e y soc ia l areas o f p o v e r t y 
reduc t ion and soc ia l inc lus ion . The r isks o f n o t t a c k l i n g these challenges c o u l d weaken the 
recove ry and undermine Argentina’s soc ia l and econom ic development f o r the l o n g t e rm . 

T h e ob jec t ive o f the n ew I B R D - I F C Jo in t C A S i s t o seek oppo r tun i t ies t o build an inves tmen t 
partnership t o support Gove rnmen t e f fo r ts t o t rans i t ion f r o m c r is is recove ry t o sustained, p r iva te 
sector-led g r ow t h with im p r o v e d equ i ty and reduced s t ruc tu ra l pove r ty . A successh l t rans i t ion 
requ i res a long - te rm development strategy inco rpo ra t ing feasible po l ic ies t o reduce soc ia l 
exc lus ion and strengthen governance. The three p i l l a r s o f the 2004 CAS-sustained 
g r ow t h with 
equity, social i n c l u s i o n and im p r o v e d governance-remain 
v a l i d and p r o v i d e the founda t ion f o r 
the new CAS . The IFC i s prepared t o comp lemen t support f r o m IBRD by p r o v i d i n g long - te rm 
financing and structured finance p roduc ts t o companies and p ro jec ts in strategic sectors, with an 
emphasis o n groups expanding o n a South-South basis and expo r t -o r ien ted o r expo r t f a c i l i t a t i n g 
p ro jec ts . IFC’s a b i l i t y t o support p r iva te sector engagement in in f ras t ruc tu re and p u b l i c services 
p ro jec ts w i l l depend o n the adop t ion o f a clear and stable p o l i c y f ramewo rk res to r ing the 
cond i t ions f o r p r iva te sector pa r t ic ipa t ion in in f ras t ruc tu re b o t h in t e r m s o f ex is t ing and fu tu re 
investments in this area. 

Suppo r t ing med ium - te rm development goals w i l l con t inue t o challenge the Bank as l o n g as 
Argentina’s r e f o rm comm i tmen t remains uncertain. In 2004, the B a n k addressed this unce r ta in ty 
by, o n an exceptional basis, t runca t ing the C A S f r o m 5 years t o , 2 0 mon ths and conduc t ing a 
s t ruc tu ra l r e v i ew with the Gove rnmen t (on w h i c h s t a f f b r i e f e d the B o a r d in June 2004). T h e 
C A S incorporates the key lessons f r o m the 2004 C A S . F i rs t , the limited p o l i c y d ia logue with the 

i 

Gove rnmen t and t h e lack o f an ac t ive IMF p rog ram have made i t d i f f i c u l t t o sustain p o l i c y based 
lending and the reby the envisaged l e v e l o f resources. Second, the shift t o investment lending has 
increased the emphasis o n performance and underlined the challenge o f strengthening the 
Government’s p r o j e c t imp lemen ta t ion capacity. Third, while the basis f o r investment lend ing 
has been l a i d in several key areas, ach iev ing a h l l - f l e d g e d inves tmen t partnership requires a 
longe r time h o r i z o n than the truncated 2004 CAS. 

T h e assistance strategy reflects constructive consultations with the Government, and b u i l d s o n 
the extensive consu l ta t ion h e l d in preparation f o r the 2004 CAS. The 2004 CAS presented an 
approach whe reby the Bank w o u l d seek t o engage in active dialogue, and, where there was 
consensus, p roceed t o lend ing operations; where consensus was pending, the B a n k w o u l d seek t o 
m a i n t a i n engagement, i n c l u d i n g th rough ana ly t ica l wo rk . The CAS ma in ta ins this approach, 
with substantial n e w lending p lanned f o r roads, health, income support f o r the poor, and p u b l i c 
sector strengthening. D ia logue with c i v i l society and the p r iva te sector has been very productive, 
i n c l u d i n g a Deve lopmen t Ma rke tp lace o n Y o u t h and Values held in Buenos Aires in mid 2005 
and economic w o r k o n the dynam ic re la t ionsh ip between growth, p o v e r t y and equ i ty . 

T h e CAS covers three years (2006 t o 2008) and p resen ts a base case o f US$3 .3 b i l l i o n 
exc lus ive ly f o r inves tmen t operations. This scenario i s appropriate p r o v i d e d macroeconomic 
s t a b i l i t y continues. Shou ld the Gove rnmen t reques t p o l i c y based l e n d i n g and establish adequate 
cond i t ions ( inc lud ing a satisfactory mac ro framework), up to 25 percent o f the base-case 
envelope c o u l d b e reallocated t o p o l i c y based loans. A range o f l o w cases i s also possible i f 
mac roeconom ic po l ic ies we re t o deteriorate, g r ow t h falter, and p o r t f o l i o management weaken. 
A CAS progress repo r t w i l l b e prepared m i d -w a y th rough the CAS pe r iod . Mo reove r , 
management proposes t o p r o v i d e pe r iod ic b r ie f ings t o the B o a r d o n ongo ing economic 
developments and the medium t e r m ou t look . 

T h i s i s a pe r fo rmance based CAS that con f i rms the emphasis o n concrete government ac t ion 
established under the 2004 CAS. I t fo rma l izes the t rans i t ion by the B a n k f r o m the coordinated 
e f f o r t t o m a i n t a i n exposure o f the I F I s w h i l e A rgen t ina recove red f r o m the crisis. The sh i f t t o 
100 percent inves tmen t lending highlights the challenge f o r the Gove rnmen t to s ign i f ican t ly 
increase i t s imp lemen ta t ion capacity, w h i c h i s s t i l l being r e b u i l t after the crisis. This inves tmen t

Overview 

I. INTRODUCT ION 

1. 
A rgen t ina ’s recove ry f r o m the economic and social c r is is o f 2001-02, one o f the mos t 
severe losses o f i n c om e and down tu rns in l iv ing standards o n record, has been impressive. A f t e r 
three years o f fas t growth, GDP in 2005 reached the p re -c r is is peak o f 1998, w i th per capita 
ou tpu t expected t o recover t o peak l e v e l s in 2006. E x p o r t earnings are h ighe r , tax revenues have 
increased substantially, f isca l accounts are in surplus, and the Gove rnmen t has restructured three 
quarters o f i t s deb t in default. The recove ry has been pro-poor. Pove r ty has been cu t m a r k e d l y 
f r o m the depths o f the crisis, but s t i l l remains above the l e v e l p r i o r t o the onset o f the recession 
in 1998. U n em p l o ym e n t has also fallen. A l t h o u g h i n f o rm a l i t y rema ins widespread, f o rm a l 
emp loymen t i s rebounding, with j o b g r ow t h in the f o rm a l sector b e g i n n i n g t o outpace j o b s in the 
i n f o rm a l sector. 
Inequa l i ty , w h i c h has been o n a long - te rm u pw a r d t rend in Argentina, was 
exacerbated by the c r is is and has yet t o show a substantial response t o the recove ry . The social 
advances during the recove ry have been f r o m a l o w starting p o i n t and la rge segments o f the 
popu la t ion con t inue t o face great hardship. 

2. 
The challenge f o r A rgen t ina i s t o build o n the strong recove ry t o establish the founda t ion 
for sustainable, m o r e equ i tab ly shared p r iva te sector-led economic g r ow t h ove r the medium

g row th , recu r r ing pe r iods o f c r is is and increasing soc ia l exclusion. P ruden t macroeconomic 
po l ic ies have p l a y e d a cen t ra l r o l e in the recovery. A successful t rans i t ion t o sustained g r ow t h 
w i l l require, in add i t ion t o con t inued p ruden t macroeconomic management, a comb ina t ion o f 
longe r - te rm strategy and p ro -ac t ive po l ic ies t o p romo te p r iva te investment, expand social 
i n c l u s i o n t o tack le g r ow i n g p rob lems o f s t ruc tu ra l p o v e r t y and exc luded populations, and 
strengthen governance unde r a sound ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk . T h e w i n d o w f o r p o l i c y ac t ion i s 
n o t open-ended. After r em a i n i n g subdued in 2003-04, i n f l a t i o n accelerated t o doub le digits in 
2005. Many o f the factors that have con t r ibu ted t o the recovery-the 
n o rm a l and t rans i to ry 
effects o f a rebound f r o m crisis-are 
reach ing the i r na tu ra l limit. T h e l a r g e l y b e n i g n external 
env i ronmen t that has p reva i led in the in te rna t iona l economy ove r recen t years cannot be coun ted 
o n t o be sustained.

Argentina’s long - te rm interests w i l l be well served by the deve lopmen t o f a longe r te rm - 
strategy and p o l i c y f ramewo rk tha t i s supported by s t rong ins t i tu t ions . The ou t l ine o f a new 
development agenda has emerged in recent years in w h i c h the Gove rnmen t i s assuming a m o r e 
p roac t ive r o l e in addressing long -s tand ing issues o f p o v e r t y and soc ia l exclusion, p rob lems 
w h i c h are pe rce ived t o have been exacerbated by the p o l i c i e s o f the 1990s. Since the crisis, the 
Government has taken d i rec t ac t ion in two areas. First, emergency soc ia l transfer programs f o r 
the p o o r have been extended t o a s ign i f ican t p r o p o r t i o n o f the en t i re popu la t ion . Second, the 
state has become m u c h m o r e d i r e c t l y i n v o l v e d in decisions a f fec t ing the p r o v i s i o n o f 
infrastructure and p u b l i c services, i n c l u d i n g the c o n t r o l o f ta r i f fs and investments t o increase 
access. W h i l e progress has been made t ow a r d establishing a c red ib le p o l i c y f ramewo rk in 
ce r ta in sectors (health and education), such progress has ye t t o b e ach ieved in other impo r tan t 
sectors, mos t notably, p u b l i c services.

va l id , in fact 
even m o r e so as the coun t ry shifts f r om a focus o n c r is is response t o med ium - te rm g row th . In

Mac roeconom ic p o l i c y since 2003 has emphasized tight f isca l discipline, 
im p r o v e d 
external competitiveness and a rebuilding o f in te rna t iona l reserves (Tab le 1). The Fede ra l 
Government recorded a p r im a r y surplus o f 2.3 percent o f GDP in 2003, 3.9 percent in 2004, and 
an estimated 3.7 percent in 2005. At the p r o v i n c i a l level, a p r i m a r y surplus o f 0.7 percent o f 
GDP was achieved in 2003, inc reas ing to 0.9 percent in 2004, and i s estimated at 0.5 percent in 
2005. Inflation rema ined w e l l under c o n t r o l in 2003-04, despite the massive deva lua t ion during 
the crisis, a l though p r i c e pressures reemerged in 2005 with i n f l a t i o n reach ing 12.3 percent by the 
end o f the year. The exchange rate was ma in ta ined in a n a r r ow range a round AR$2 .9 t o the US 
do l la r th rough mos t o f 2005, and i s now t rad ing in a range o f abou t AR$3 .05 t o the U S do l la r . 
T h e deva lua t ion o f the Peso has he lped restore competitiveness, unde rp inned a sharp tu rna round 
in the trade balance, and supported a build up o f in te rna t iona l reserves. Ano the r impo r tan t factor 
in the reserve buildup was the suspension o f m o s t p u b l i c  debt service paymen ts be tween 
December 2001 when the sovereign de fau l t was announced and June 2005 when the debt

exchange c o v e r i n g about three-quarters o f this debt was completed. 
In ea r ly January 2006, 
A rgen t ina p r e p a i d 100 percent o f i t s obligations t o the IMF o f SDR 6.7 b i l l i o n (US$9.7 b i l l i o n ) 
w h i c h reduced in te rna t iona l reserves from app rox ima te ly US$28 b i l l i o n to US$18 .5 b i l l i o n . The

111. THE GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

17. When President K i r c h n e r took o f f i c e in M a y 2003 h e ou t l ined the p r i n c i p a l goals o f h i s 
adm in is t ra t ion in an address t o the N a t i o n a l Assembly. H e stressed the need f o r con t inued 
economic s t a b i l i t y with sustained g r ow t h in the order o f 4-5 percent such tha t w o u l d generate 
emp loymen t and enable rea l incomes t o double in the space o f f i f t e e n years. Mindful that the 
2001 gove rnmen t de fau l t o n p u b l i c debt was the result o f excessive b o r r ow i n g and f a u l t y 
economic management, he pledged t o f o l l ow prudent f isca l po l ic ies tha t w o u l d secure f isca l 
surplus o n a consistent basis. In that context, special men t ion was made o f the need f o r tax 
reforms that w o u l d b roaden the tax base, reduce special exemptions and increase tax co l lec t ion . 

18. 
At the same time, h e envisaged a strong government r o l e in guiding economic g r ow t h 
within a con tex t o f “na t iona l cap i ta l ism ”. Government w o u l d pa r t ic ipa te ac t ive ly in the 
p r o v i s i o n o f infrastructure, b r o a d l y defined t o inc lude hous ing as well as hea l th and education 
facilities. Soc ia l services w o u l d b e upgraded with the ob jec t ive o f inc reas ing b o t h coverage and 
qua l i ty . And measures w o u l d b e taken t o address the co r rup t ion o f the 1990s. Howeve r , while 
acknow ledg ing the need f o r a robus t social safety net, President K i r c h n e r was quite e x p l i c i t in 
stating that “ the p rob lems of pove r ty cannot be solved by soc ia l po l ic ies bu t ra the r by economic 
po l ic ies ”. The Gove rnmen t has been consistent in i t s pursuit o f these goals and articulate in the i r 
e labo ra t ion in successive o f f i c i a l documents and p u b l i c speeches, i n c l u d i n g in the authorities’ 
development v i s i o n described in A n n e x A o f this CAS . 

19. A l i t t l e m o r e than a year after tak ing o f f ice , in June 2004, the Gove rnmen t submitted t o 
the Bank (as pa r t o f the Econom ic Recove ry Support Loan2), the Adm in is t ra t ion ’s development 
agenda, After a leng thy and comprehensive c r i t i c i sm o f the po l ic ies pu rsued during the 1 9 9 0 ~ ~ 
the document, in a section ca l led “Guidelines o f the l o n g t e r m scenario”, describes a v i s i o n very 
m u c h in l i n e with that set ou t t o the N a t i o n a l Assemb ly . T h e A rgen t ine economy w o u l d be 
based o n f isca l d isc ip l ine and exchange rate competitiveness t o achieve broader based g row th . 
This growth, the documen t stated, w o u l d resu l t in a “new con f igu ra t ion o f re la t ive p r ices that 
w o u l d enable strengthening o f advances already observed.. .in the labo r market, and., .in other 
social indicators”. As has in fact happened, the A dm i n i s t r a t i o n an t ic ipa ted that this new scenario 
w o u l d con t r ibu te t o m o r e labo r in tens ive p roduc t ion and a b roade r d i s t r i b u t i o n o f income. 

20. 
Three mon ths later, the Gove rnmen t re i te ra ted these p r inc ip les in the prospectus f o r i t s 
debt res t ruc tu r ing o f fe r , w h i c h i t subm i t ted t o the U n i t e d States Securities and Exchange 
Comm iss ion in September 2004.3 I t stated that the m a i n goals o f the Adm in is t ra t ion ’s economic

21, 
The A dm i n i s t r a t i o n has in fact pursued m a n y o f these economic goals, a l though in a w a y 
consistent with i t s ove ra rch ing p r inc ip les o f an assertive r o l e f o r government and an emphasis o n 
social considerations. With respect to a t t rac t ing investment, f o r example, 
the President 
f requen t ly reiterates that A rgen t ina needs in f ras t ruc tu re investment, but that such investment 
must be different in nature and resu l t than the inves tmen t patterns o f the 1990s, and, as h e said 
recently, have a “clear Keynes ian and he te rodoxy4 v i s i o n that generates growth, employment, 
social i n c l u s i o n and equ i ty . 

22. 
T h e A dm i n i s t r a t i o n has been s im i l a r l y consistent in the area o f social p o l i c y , Beginning 
in M a y 30, 2005, in m a r k i n g i t s f i r s t t w o years in o f f ice , the K i r c h n e r adm in is t ra t ion began 
o u t l i n i n g p u b l i c l y a set o f amb i t ious goals, w i th clear and measurable targets, to b e reached at the 
end o f i t s f i r s t t e r m in 2007. C h i e f among these goals i s t o reduce unemp loymen t and p ~ v e r t y . ~ 
T o reach these goals, President K i rchne r has identified hous ing cons t ruc t ion and improving the 
q u a l i t y o f educa t ion as t w o key in i t ia t ives ; h e has also focused o n the challenges f o r youth, 
pa r t icu la r ly w i th respec t t o the high pove r ty rate among you th . T ow a r d this end, the President 
has p u b l i c l y ca l led fo r b road re fo rms and n ew funding f o r education and techn ica l t ra in ing . In 
October, h e submitted a p roposa l t o Congress tha t ca l led f o r lengthening the schoo l day,

governments t o education, science and techno logy t o r i s e f r o m 4.3 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 6

underscored the impo r tance o f addressing long -s tand ing p rob lems in soc ia l p ro tec t ion . First, the 
system, as in other coun t r ies in the reg ion , i s fragmented, with p rog rams a imed at d i f fe ren t

ch i ldhood and p r i m a r y education, especially in comparison t o the r e g i o n and other deve lop ing 
countries. H ow e v e r , repe t i t ion and drop-out rates rema in high at the secondary leve l . On

A. 

Rationale for Bank Support to Argentina 

5 9 . 

The ra t iona le f o r con t inued W o r l d B a n k support to A rgen t ina rema ins compe l l ing , and i s 
consistent with the Bank ’s strategy fo r assistance to middle income countries described in the 
B o a r d Report, Enhanc ing W o r l d B a n k Support to Middle Income Coun t r ies (SecM2004-0071). 
First, the B a n k has a key r o l e t o play in helping Argentina-to 
the extent i t s p o l i c y f ramewo rk 
can be supported-tackle 
a massive development agenda for sustaining g row th , reduc ing pove r ty 
and p r om o t i n g im p r o v e d governance. At nea r ly 34 percent o f the popu la t ion , pove r ty in 
A rgen t ina i s high, and, after successive periods o f fast g r ow t h and deep recession, i s becom ing 
inc reas ing ly structural. Mo reove r , this na t iona l average masks severe geographical and 
demographic inequa l i t ies . A v i s i t o r to Buenos Aires’ b road avenues w o u l d h a r d l y k n o w that 
soc ia l cond i t ions in some par ts o f the country-including 
just m i l e s f r o m the cap i ta l city-are 
v i r t u a l l y ind is t ingu ishab le f r o m the poorest parts o f any area in the deve lop ing w o r l d . T a c k l i n g 
these p rob lems w i l l requ i re substantial and sustained investments in many areas, and the long - 
t e r m resources available f r om the B a n k Group-including 
IFC-can be pa r t icu la r ly re levan t in a 
coun t ry that has suffered f r o m a high degree o f v o l a t i l i t y in i t s external f inanc ing . Second, the 
B a n k remains an impo r tan t g loba l in te r locu to r with the A rgen t ine authorities, and ma in ta ins 
extensive outreach to the p r iva te sector and c i v i l society. The d ia logue that has been ca r r ied ou t 
in re la t ion to the 2005 study o n sustained,growth and social equ i ty suggests the va lue o f the 
B a n k ’ s g loba l perspective t o A rgen t ina . As c l ien t research conducted fo r the C A S indicates, the 
p r iva te sector and c i v i l society be l ieve that the Bank can p l a y a r o l e as a neu t ra l vo ice in the 
na t iona l debate o n economic and social issues . F ina l ly , with some US $ 7 b i l l i o n in exposure t o 
Argentina, the B a n k has a la rge f inanc ia l stake in helping the coun t ry secure i t s future.

In add i t ion t o i t s regu la r contacts with NGOs , p r iva te sector and academia, in Novembe r 
2005, the W o r l d B a n k ca r r ied ou t f i v e CAS -spec i f ic consultations with c i v i c leaders at the

F o l l o w i n g are some o f the salient and common op in ions expressed during the 
consultations. T w o things stand ou t about the common themes that emerged f r o m these 
consultations. First, they a re b road ly consistent with the ideas and guidance expressed in 2003 
(see A n n e x E o f 2004 CAS). Second, they also complement the themes i d e n t i f i e d in the c l ien t 
research conduc ted f o r the present C A S (Annex I). 

87. 
One k e y sentiment expressed by m a n y o f the pa r t ic ipan ts was that the B a n k w o u l d be 
mos t e f fec t ive by suppo r t ing A rgen t ina ’s development agenda, rather than imp lemen t ing a rec ipe 
o f re fo rms deve loped in Washington. 
In the s am e context, while we lcom ing the Bank’s 
con t r ibu t ion t o the economic and social discourse in Argentina, m a n y pa r t ic ipan ts suggested that 
the B a n k exercise cau t ion in n o t dom ina t ing the discussion. Others ind ica ted that a mo re subtle 
r o l e w o u l d h e l p p reven t against knee-jerk resistance t o positions, so le ly because they are 
associated with the W o r l d Bank . T h i s discussion was l i n k e d to the Bank ’s operational role, with 
an o v e rw h e lm i n g numbe r o f participants a rgu ing that the B a n k shou ld limit support t o specific 
inves tmen t operations and less, i f at all, to development p o l i c y lend ing . 

88 . 
In terms o f where the B a n k shou ld p rov ide support, pa r t ic ipan ts f r o m across the coun t ry 
and among the different groups identified education and support f o r sma l l and medium 
e n t e r p r i s e s (SMEs ) as the tw o mos t impo r tan t p r io r i t ies f o r the Bank . Support t o education

O n m o r e spec i f ic issues that relate t o the Bank ’s po r t fo l io , the Bank ’s support f o r 
in f ras t ruc tu re deve lopmen t was widely welcomed, as w e l l as the assistance t o the income support 
programs; the la t te r was ex t reme ly highly regarded as a m a j o r con t r ibu t ion , especially in the 
poo re r p rov inces o f the no r the rn pa r t o f the coun t ry . M o v i n g fo rwa rd , m a n y participants asked 
the B a n k t o focus o n emp loymen t creation in order t o achieve rea l soc ia l inc lus ion f o r the 
beneficiaries o f cash transfer programs. 

90. 
Participants also we lcomed B a n k support f o r the environment, as w e l l as assistance t o 
ind igenous peop le and other ma rg ina l ized groups. One in te res t ing commen t that emerged 
th roughou t the consultations was the m u l t i c u l t u r a l nature o f A rgen t ina and h o w development . 
p o l i c y needs t o take this i n t o account t o prevent soc ia l exc lus ion and inequa l i ty . Re la ted t o this 
in the minds o f m a n y o f the pa r t ic ipan ts was the need t o address pens ion and social secu r i ty 
concerns. The Bank , i t was w i d e l y thought, was w e l l su i ted t o establish this concern o n the 
country’s agenda. 

91. 
I C S I D was men t ioned a numbe r o f t imes due t o the econom ic impac t that awards 
rendered against A rgen t ina might have f o r the coun t ry . The re i s also a l i m i t e d understanding o f

present in this forum12. 

92 . 
Ove ra l l , m a n y participants f e l t that the Government has fa i led t o articulate where the 
coun t ry i s head ing in the medium term, in contrast t o o p t im i sm regarding the short-term. One 
c omm o n theme was the sense that m a n y f e l t that a l though the coun t ry recovered well f r o m the 
c r is is o f 2001-02, i t was n o t clear wha t l i e ahead o r whether there was a strategic o r ien ta t ion f o r 
the deve lopmen t o f A rgen t ina . There was b road agreement o f the need f o r a highly federal

IBRD P o r t f o l i o P e r f o rm a n c e 

94. 
At the t i m e the B o a r d considered the 2004 CAS , the B a n k and the Government were we l l 
advanced in t a c k l i n g the serious p rob lems in p o r t f o l i o pe r fo rmance that arose f r om the crisis, 
mos t n o t a b l y a substantial d rop in disbursements and over h a l f o f pend ing comm i tmen ts b e i n g 
c lass i f ied as risky. T h i s requ i red intense co l labo ra t ion with the Gove rnmen t o n almost every 
area o f p o r t f o l i o management, i n c l u d i n g ensuring adequate budge ta ry allocations and reso lv ing 
numerous p ro jec t restructurings. 

95. 
The r e s u l t s have been in l i n e with the targets that we re set f o r the 2004 C A S with respect 
t o the inves tmen t p o r t i o n o f the p o r t f o l i o . Disbursements have f o l l ow e d the high case scenario, 
with the average disbursement ra t io f o r FY 2004-05 in the range o f 40 percent o f undisbursed 
comm i tmen ts p e r annum, Le., substantially above pre-crisis leve ls . The p o r t f o l i o i s also 
stronger. The percent o f p ro jec ts at risk by amount was reduced f r o m 84 percent in FY 2003 t o 
19.5 percent in FY 2005, and reached 25 percent in April 2006. S im i la r ly , the percentage o f 
p r o b l em p ro jec ts dec l ined f r o m 36 percent in 2003 t o 4 percent in FY 2005 be fo re turning up 
slightly t o 8 percent in April 2006. Progress in development p o l i c y l e n d i n g has been m u c h less 
strong, with some 6 2 percent o f p ro jec ts (by amount) c lass i f ied as unsa t is fac to ry in FY 2005. 
The Bank and the Gove rnmen t have, however, taken steps t o address t h i s p rob lem . In M a r c h 
2005, three P r o v i n c i a l R e f o rm Loans were closed and the r em a i n i n g tranches cancelled. These 
are scheduled t o b e rep laced with new investment operations in the same p rov inces . B o t h sides 
have agreed t o build o n this experience in dec id ing h o w t o address the rema in ing outstanding 
p o l i c y loans in the f ramewo rk o f the n ew CAS . 

96. 
The mos t impo r tan t challenge t o continue t o strengthen the inves tmen t p o r t f o l i o w i l l arise 
f rom the increased l e n d i n g vo lumes as the assistance strategy continues the ma rked shift towards 
inves tmen t lend ing . As men t ioned in the 2004 CAS , A rgen t ina has r e l i e d h e a v i l y o n p ro jec t 
imp lemen ta t ion units (PIUS). As the Bank expands p u b l i c inves tmen t and i t s r o l e in the 
p r o v i s i o n o f p u b l i c goods and services, a systematic and deliberate e f f o r t w i l l b e pursued in the 
c om i n g years t o assist the Gove rnmen t t o re in fo rce i t s capac i ty in the fo rmu la t ion and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f p u b l i c investments. A l t h o u g h l i m i t e d progress was made under the p rev ious 
C A S in ma ins t ream ing ins t i tu t iona l capacity and in reduc ing pa ra l le l p ro jec t management 
structures, the Gove rnmen t n o w supports th is process w i th the view t o m a i n t a i n ins t i tu t iona l 
m em o r y and t o ensure that the t rans fe r o f techno logy and know ledge i s in the hands o f the State 
and n o t independent consultants. 

97. 
As discussed in the f i d u c i a r y assessment section, recen t developments p o i n t towa rds 
increased concerns in the f i d u c i a r y env i ronmen t and i t s im p a c t o n B a n k operations. T h e C A S

In agriculture, IFC comm i t ted a US$ lOO m i l l i o n l o a n ( inc lud ing US $ 3 0 m i l l i o n f o r

I F C also made a U S $ 4 0 m i l l i o n equ i ty investment in a lead ing

101. F ina l ly , in the o i l and gas sector, I F C p r o v i d e d US$255 .5 m i l l i o n ( inc lud ing US$135

for an A rgen t ine bo r rowe r since the coun t ry ’s econom ic c r is is in 2001, was oversubscribed. 

102. 
IFC has made s ign i f ican t progress in res t ruc tu r ing i t s exposure t o A rgen t ine companies, 
with the excep t ion o f the p u b l i c service concession p ro jec ts where concerns con t inue that the

103. 
L o o k i n g forward, 
I F C w i l l support the Bank G roup assistance strategy, p r im a r i l y 
con t r ibu t ing t o the pillar o f “sustained g r ow t h with equity”, 
in the area where I F C has 
compa ra t ive advantage. C red i t access by the p r iva te sector has im p r o v e d over the last year,

a l leged ly v io la ted investors’ rights under the

In September 2005, A rgen t ina filed a request with I C S I D f o r annulment o f the

Country Financing Parameters 

128. The Gove rnmen t agreed to the new Coun t ry F inanc ing Parameters in ea r ly 2005 (Annex 
J), and has w e l c om e d the increased f l e x i b i l i t y that the n ew Bank p o l i c y p rov ides with rega rd t o 
e l ig ib le expenditures. Howeve r , the degree t o w h i c h the Government w o u l d l i k e t o use the 
increased f l e x i b i l i t y depends la rge ly o n i t s strategy f o r funding development needs. The degree 
t o w h i c h the B a n k w i l l use the increased f l e x i b i l i t y w i l l in turn depend o n the B a n k ’ ove ra l l 
exposure, as w e l l as the impac t o n the Bank’s a b i l i t y t o f i n d other p ro jec ts under the C A S and 
the po ten t ia l t o reduce transaction costs. 

129. 
In te rms o f cost sharing, the n ew parame ters propose f l e x i b i l i t y f o r the B a n k t o finance 
up t o 100 pe rcen t o f t o t a l p ro jec t costs, when this w o u l d resu l t in substantially reduced 
transaction costs and in a substantial impac t o n pove r ty a l lev ia t ion . In other cases, f l e x i b i l i t y in 
cost sharing w i l l depend u p o n the Bank ’s ove ra l l l e n d i n g envelope, and subject t o satisfactory 
owne rsh ip o f the ove ra l l p rog ram and at the sector leve l . T h e Bank ’s f inanc ing share o f 
i n d i v i d u a l p ro jec ts i s howeve r expected t o continue at current levels. 

130. With rega rd t o Bank financing o f recurrent costs, the new parameters propose n o coun t ry - 
l e v e l limit. F r o m an economic perspective, sound f isca l management and the fact that B a n k 
f inanc ing i s fully in teg ra ted in the budget and taken i n t o account in f isca l and debt targets 
ind ica te that 
f inanc ing o f recurrent costs w o u l d n o t jeopa rd ize ove ra l l f isca l o r debt 
sustainability. Therefore, n o coun t ry - leve l limit o n recu r ren t cost f inanc ing i s proposed. F r o m a 
p ro jec t perspective, f inanc ing o f recurrent costs unde r B a n k p ro jec ts i s l i k e l y t o con t inue t o take 
p lace o n l y in excep t iona l cases, a l though in the fu tu re increased f l e x i b i l i t y m a y b e app l ied w h e n 
there are special emergency and p r o j ect-related circumstances. 

131. 
In te rms o f 
l o c a l cost financing, 
the requirements 
f o r B a n k f inanc ing o f l o c a l 
expenditures are met, and the new parameters a l l ow f inanc ing o f l o c a l costs in the p r o p o r t i o n 
needed in i n d i v i d u a l p ro jec ts . The change in p o l i c y i s n o t expected t o represent a m a j o r 
dev ia t ion f r o m the p r e v a i l i n g practice in l o c a l cost f inanc ing in Argentina, since the B a n k has 
been f inanc ing substantial l o c a l costs in the past. With respect t o taxes and duties, the new 
f inanc ing parameters a l l ow the B a n k t o finance a l l taxes and duties associated with p ro jec t 
expenditures with the excep t ion o f im p o r t t a r i f f s above 28 percent, w h i c h i s the average o f the 
Me rcosu r c omm o n ex te rna l t a r i f f . At the p ro jec t level, the B a n k w o u l d also consider whe the r 
taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share o f p ro jec t costs.

Under the premise that fo re ign p o l i c y and in te rna t iona l economic re la t ions are

Sho r t a n d M e d i um T e rm Development Objectives 

After the successful conc lus ion o f the debt res t ruc tu r ing process, the current phase

p rese rv ing p r i c e s tab i l i ty , (b) sustaining the competitiveness o f domestic p roduc t ion and, 
based o n these two, (c) con t inu ing and accelerating the process o f recupe ra t ion o f the

In te rms o f the first objective, the Gove rnmen t i s ac t ing firmly t o preserve the

and (ii) those designed t o con f ron t mechanisms tha t c o u l d con t r ibu te t o a p r i c e 
acceleration in an open sm a l l economy, even in a con tex t o f f isca l and ex te rna l balance. 

A m o n g the fo rme r w e m a y m e n t i o n the r o l e o f the fiscal, mone ta ry and ex te rna l 
po l ic ies that have been imp lemen ted since the collapse o f the Conve r t ib i l i ty regime, 
designed t o disactivate the fundamental mechanisms o f the i n f l a t i o n phenomenon. The re

during the last decades h a d a preponderant r o l e in the deve lopmen t o f the high i n f l a t i o n 
regime that a f f l i c t e d the Repub l ic o f A rgen t ina f o r so long . In the n e w mac roeconom ic 
environment, n o t o n l y has there been a s ign i f ican t imp rovemen t in the cond i t ion o f the

substantial current account su rp luses , after h a v i n g su f fe red systematic de f ic i ts during the

Thirdly, after the sharp change in re la t ive p r ices that took p lace in 2002, the p r ices

In f isca l terms, revenues have g r ow n as a consequence o f the qu icke r pace o f

unsustainable increase in fo re ign debt, w h i c h in turn m a y create doub ts about the

These preconditions, comp lemen ted with spec i f ic sectoral p o l i c i e s that are b e i n g

As f o r the fiscal targets, i t shou ld be no ted that during the years 2003-2005 a 
sustained surplus was generated in the p u b l i c accounts, something unprecedented in the 
last 50 years. Th is surplus was the resu l t o f the sharp increase in f isca l revenues, while 
expenditures have f o l l ow e d a m o r e moderate path, i n i t i a l l y d r i v e n by p rog rams that were

Macroeconomic Policies and Reform Program to attain the Targets 

In order t o a v o i d repea t ing the b o o m and bus t patterns that are characteristic o f 
the past and achieve the targets se t ou t above, i t i s necessary t o preserve the basic 
macroeconomic balances, while s t imu la t ing the convergence o f the mac ro aggregates 
towards p ropo r t ions tha t ensure sustainable g r ow t h rates in a stable env i ronmen t . As 
opposed t o wha t occu r red in the past, the s o l i d surpluses in the f isca l and external 
accounts cu r ren t ly in place, the fo re ign exchange po l icy , and a we l l -ba lanced te r r i to r ia l 
g r ow t h open up oppo r tun i t ies to achieve las t ing economic g row th . 

One aspect that con t r ibu tes t o sus ta inab i l i ty i s the g r ow i n g share o f the tradable 
sectors in the economy: w h i l e in 1998 the tradable sectors accounted f o r o n l y 2 6 percent 
o f GDP at current prices, by the end o f 2004 these sectors represented m o r e than 40 
percent. A t the same time, to ta l trade, exports and imports, m o r e than doub led as a 
percentage o f GDP, w h i c h im p l i e s that the recove ry has taken p lace within the 
framework o f an e f f e c t i v e l y open economy. A l l this shou ld translate i n t o stable g r ow t h 
during the periods o f no rma l i ty , and i n t o an economy better p repa red t o dea l with adverse 
changes in the environment, avo id ing p r o f o u n d c r is is episodes with devastating social 
and p roduc t ion consequences. Ano the r element o f sus ta inab i l i ty i s the equitable

deve lopmen t o f the coun t ry ’s various regions. 
In that sense, a l though the new 
mac roeconom ic env i ronmen t has been ex t reme ly favorable f o r the recove ry o f p r im a r y 
p r o d u c t i o n a n d the reg iona l economies, the Government has pursued a series o f po l ic ies 
t o s t imu la te r e g i o h a l p roduc t ion . 

The econom ic authorities consider that today i t i s essential t o extend the re fo rms 
ca r r ied ou t s ince 2002, th rough a social and p o l i t i c a l comm i tmen t t o sustain the 
t rans fo rma t ions pursued, since, as already explained, these f o r m a consistent and coherent 
ensemble. In that sense, a l though there s t i l l rema in impo r tan t medium and l o n g t e rm 
challenges re la ted t o the necessary process o f im p r o v i n g the ins t i tu t ions that gove rn 
economic l i f e in Argentina, the re fo rms that have been imp lemen ted have made i t 
possible t o rea l ize a macroeconomic environment that i s suitable t o address such 
challenges. 

Thus, m o r e than a listing o f short te rm pending reforms, Argentina’s economy 
today faces a series o f p o l i c y challenges (detailed in the f i rs t part) different f r o m those 
that existed until n ow . In particular, the nature o f the p rob lems that need to b e addressed 
by econom ic p o l i c y in the current circumstances requ i res a renewed “ f ine tuning” in the 
management o f p o l i c y instruments, that w i l l c o n f i rm the current p a t h o f the e v o l u t i o n o f 
A rgen t ina ’s economy . 

The A rgen t ine Government, however, i s aware tha t a sustainable mac roeconom ic 
con tex t i s a necessary but n o t su f f ic ien t cond i t ion t o a t ta in a degree o f economic and 
soc ia l development h is to r ica l ly compa t ib le with the aspirations o f Argentine society. 
Tha t i s the reason why, while con t inu ing t o imp lemen t soc ia l safety po l ic ies , measures 
are b e i n g taken to im p r o v e the qua l i ty o f the labo r fac to r o f p roduc t ion , in order t o foster 
greater soc ia l m o b i l i t y . At the same time, a series o f po l ic ies have been developed t o 
extend and mode rn ize the infrastructure, and s t imu la te p r iva te investment. In that sense, 
and t a k i n g i n t o account that the evo lu t ion o f inves tmen t (bo th in phys ica l and h um a n 
cap i ta l t e rm s ) i s a p r i o r i t y o f the Federal Government, a s e r i e s o f po l ic ies t o strengthen 
investment have been pursued, as detailed in the f o l l o w i n g section.

an upside scenario has been prepared. With respect t o

the d is t r ibu t ion o f

Following the c r i s i s and during

f. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and 
other diseases 
Target: Have halted by 201 5-and begun 
to reverse-the spread of HZV/AIDS 

16. 
Since ma la r ia i s less o f a p r o b l em 
in Argentina, especially in u rban areas, the 
coun t ry has identified Tuberculosis and 
Chagas’, diseases to comba t by 2015 
a long with HIVIAIDS. A c c o r d i n g 
t o 
recent data, imp rovemen ts in these areas 
have been v e r y modest, and A rgen t ina 
w o u l d need significant efforts t o meet the 
MDG goals. 

17. 
The prevalence o f tuberculosis has 
been 
dec l in ing due 
t o 
successh l 
in te rven t ion programs. In 2003 there were 
about 5 5 peop le with tuberculosis over 
100,000 inhabitants. In contrast, m o r t a l i t y 
reductions have stagnated and n o fu r the r 
imp rovemen t has occurred since 2000. 
T h e same applies t o the rates o f de tec t ion 
and treatment o f cases, w h i c h dec l ined 
s ign i f ican t ly during the 1990s but have 
rema ined constant during recent years. 

18. 
Imp rovemen ts in the prevalence o f 
Chagas 
have 
been 
geog raph ica l ly 
heterogeneous. Ac tua l ly , in 2004 o n l y 2 6 
percent o f the endemic p rov inces h a d 
ce r t i f ied the in te r rup t ion o f the r i s k o f 
in fec t ion . This shows a meager advance 
in comparison t o the beg inn ing o f the 
decade. 

19. 
The incidence o f HIV/AIDS has 
been f a l l i n g in recent years, the same as 
the m o r t a l i t y rate a l though at a s lowe r 
pace.

vulnerable groups. 

g. Ensure Environmental Sustainability 

Target: Reduce by half the proportion 
of population without access to safe 
drinking water o r sanitation 

20. 
The ove ra l l l e v e l o f access t o clean 
water 
in A rgen t ina 
i s 94 percent. 
A c c o r d i n g t o urban data f o r 2003, the 
percentage o f peop le w i t h o u t access t o 
water i s about 1.6 percent, v e r y close t o 
the target o f 1.5 percent. In r u r a l areas the 
s i tua t ion i s less favorable, but there i s l i t t l e 
n ew data since 2001. Census data f o r 
2001 
ind ica te 
that app rox ima te ly 22 
percent o f the t o t a l p o p u l a t i o n h a d n o 
access 
to safe drinking wa te r (pub l ic 
n e tw o r k o r p um p e d water), w h i c h i s a 
no ted imp rovemen t f r o m 3 4 percent in 
1990. 

21. 
Access 
t o 
san i ta t ion services 
appears t o b e m o r e restricted, but the 
analysis i s l i m i t e d due t o l a c k o f data. 
A b o u t 40 percent o f the u r b a n popu la t ion 
has n o access t o secure san i ta t ion services. 
W h e n r u r a l areas are also 
taken i n t o 
account, the percentage rises t o 5 8 percent. 
Consequently, m o r e e f fo r ts are needed to 
mee t the MDG goal.

Argentina: CAS Completion Report 

Date o f CAS: 
Da te o f Supplemental No te 

January 29 ,2004 
April 5,2004 

Repor t N o . 27340-AR 
Re f : R2003-0207/2 

Summary 

T h i s document contains an evaluation o f CAS objectives in Argentina together with the respective 
contributions o f the Government and the Bank during the time segment o f the CAS (Ap r i l 2004 through 
December 2005) that was considered by the Board in Apr i l 2004. T h e 2004 CAS was written i n exceptional 
circumstances at a time when Argentina had recently emerged from the deepest economic c r i s i s in recent history 
and the Bank was s t i l l i n the process o f establishing an operational relationship with the newly elected 
Government o f President Kirchner who assumed office in May 2003. As a result o f the uncertain country 
situation, the Board date for the CAS was twice postponed and, after consultations with Executive Directors, 
management asked only for endorsement o f a 20 month operations program although the CAS had been drafted 
with a 4 % year horizon in mind. 
T h e truncated 20 month term o f the CAS makes i t difficult to identify and evaluate outcomes over so 
short a period. While the CAS was results based, i t did not distinguish clearly between overall country 
objectives and CAS-specific objectives which adds further to the difficulty o f evaluating outcomes. 
Broadly speaking, overall country outcomes have been very good. During the CAS period 2004-05 
Argentina further consolidated its economic recovery with GDP growth o f 9 percent in 2004 and an estimated 8 
percent in 2005. Fiscal policy has been well disciplined and inflation has been kept under control although i t 
began to increase again in 2005. The resolution o f structural issues left over from the c r i s i s proceeded at a slower 
pace. In June 2005 the Government completed a debt swap covering 76 percent o f bonds in default but that still 
le f t U S 2 4 billion o f defaulted debt outstanding and unresolved as well as US$4 b i l l ion o f arrears to the Paris 
Club. T h e renegotiation o f public u t i l i ty and infrastructure concessions i s lagging and has been complicated i n 
many cases by litigation pending before ICSID. 
From an operational viewpoint, the lending program proposed i n the 2004 CAS represented a radical 
break with the past. Whereas adjustment lending had previously been the principal vehicle for Bank assistance 
to Argentina, i t was to account fo r only one quarter o f the US$2 b i l l ion lending envelope envisaged for 2004-05. 
Consistent with the wishes o f the new Government, investment lending was to account for the remaining 75 
percent. 

T h e shift from adjustment to investment lending was a challenge for both the Government and the 
Bank because the economic c r is is , the preceding recession and a downsizing o f public sector investment in the 
nineties all had seriously impaired the performance o f the existing investment portfolio and weakened the project 
preparation and implementation capability o f the Government. Furthermore, the short period and limited lending 
authority constrained the medium-term strategic framework o f the CAS and led the Government to question the 
depth o f the Bank’s commitment to the program. 
Working within those constraints while, at the same time, pursuing a longer-term sector engagement, 
staff made use o f available instruments, including APLs to build-up a project pipeline that could be sequenced 
according to progress with the sector policy framework, implementation capacity and in the fiduciary 
environment. At the same time, a determined and successful effort was made to revitalize portfolio performance. 
As a result, by November 2005, significant progress has been made towards fu l f i l l ing CAS operational targets 
and objectives. T h e Bank has effectively established a partnership w i th the Government that w i l l serve as the 
centerpiece for an investment-based CAS going forward. 
T h e Bank in i t ia l ly found i t d i f f icu l t to engage the Federal Government in a policy dialogue except in a 
few sectors such as health and road transport. More recently the dialogue has opened up in areas relating to the 
linkages between growth, poverty and inequality and there has also been a good dialogue w i th some o f the 
provinces. However, an Economic Recovery Support SAL that was approved by the Board in June 2004 
remains unsigned because o f continued uncertainties in the macroeconomic framework including the indefinite 
postponement o f the I M F third review o f a stand-by arrangement. T h e d i f f icu l ty o f proceeding w i th adjustment 
lending the absence o f a sound policy dialogue vindicates the decision to shift the Bank program to investment 
lending where progress has been good.

Part A: Long-Term Strategic Goals 

The Government’s perspective 

1. 
In the pos t -c r is is environment o f Argentina, 
i t appears that a n ew p o l i c y 
f ramewo rk i s emerging. Whereas, throughout the nineties, the r o l e o f the state in the 
economy was steadily retrenched, that process i s n o w be ing reevaluated and, t o some 
extent, reversed. There appears t o b e a b road consensus that the Government shou ld 
exercise a m o r e p roac t ive r o l e in addressing the long -s tand ing social p rob lems that were 
exacerbated by the c r is is and that s t i l l beset A rgen t ina no tw i ths tand ing a strong recove ry 
and good outcomes in terms o f macroeconomic performance. Soc ia l transfer programs 
f o r the p o o r we re extended t o a s ign i f ican t p r o p o r t i o n o f the entire popu la t ion at the t im e 
o f the econom ic crisis. The Government has also become m u c h m o r e d i rec t ly i n v o l v e d 
in decisions a f fec t ing the p r o v i s i o n o f in f ras t ruc tu re and p u b l i c services, i n c l u d i n g the 
con t ro l o f ta r i f fs and investments t o increase access. Government p rac t ice has favo red 
d isc re t iona ry in te rven t ion w h i c h has n o t always been exercised within a rules-based 
f ramewo rk and the Gove rnmen t has yet t o develop a longe r te rm -v is ion that can b e 
sys tema t ica l ly imp lemen ted within a c red ib le ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk . The re in l ies the 
future challenge. 

2. 
When President K i r c h n e r t o o k o f f i c e in M a y 2003 h e ou t l ined the p r i n c i p a l goals 
o f h i s adm in is t ra t ion in an address t o the Congress. H i s first concern was t o consolidate 
the econom ic recove ry and prepare the g round f o r sustained g row th . Mindful that the 
2001 de fau l t o n p u b l i c debt was the r e s u l t o f excessive b o r r ow i n g and f a u l t y economic 
management, h e p ledged t o f o l l ow p ruden t f isca l po l ic ies that w o u l d secure f isca l surplus 
o n a consistent basis. 
In b road terms, the Gove rnmen t has been successful in that 
endeavor. A rgen t ina achieved strong g r ow t h o f 9 percent in 2004 and about 8 percent in 
2005. T h e p r im a r y fiscal surplus o f the consolidated p u b l i c sector has been in the range 
o f 3-5 percent o f GDP and pove r ty has been s i g n i f i c a n t l y reduced a l though i t remains 
above p re -c r is is levels. 

3. 
A second ob jec t ive o f the Gove rnmen t was t o spread the f r u i t s o f economic 
g r ow t h m o r e equitably. Soc ia l services we re t o b e upgraded t o increase b o t h coverage 
and qua l i ty . E f f o r t s w o u l d be made t o find p roduc t ive emp loymen t in the labo r ma rke t 
f o r those w h o h a d los t the i r source o f i n c om e as a resu l t o f the economic c r is is and, as 
pove r ty declined, emergency programs o f p o v e r t y r e l i e f we re t o b e restructured t o better 
serve the med ium - and long - te rm requirements f o r soc ia l p ro tec t ion in A rgen t ina . With 
assistance f r om the Bank, s ign i f ican t progress has been made towa rds those goals, a lbe i t 
at a s lowe r pace than anticipated. 

4. 
A third ob jec t ive o f the Gove rnmen t was t o tack le issues o f governance. 
Respond ing to a widespread pe rcep t ion that t h e management o f p u b l i c a f fa i rs h a d been 
co r rup t in the past, the n ew adm in is t ra t ion unde r took t o fight co r rup t ion . As part o f that 
e f fo r t there was t o be a r e f o rm o f the jud ic ia ry , with j u d i c i a l appointments b e i n g subject 
t o greater transparency. At the same time, the e f f i c i e n c y and effectiveness o f the p u b l i c

adm in is t ra t ion was t o be imp roved . Governance i s an area where q u i c k r e s u l t s cannot be 
expected but steady progress has been made in the last tw o years w i th assistance f r o m the 
Bank . 

The Bank’s program o f support 

5. 
T h e p rog ram proposed in the 2004 C A S was b road ly suppo r t ive o f the 
Gove rnmen t ’s p rog ram while recogn iz ing that progress w o u l d depend c r i t i c a l l y u p o n the 
effectiveness with w h i c h the authorities pursued structural and p o l i c y re fo rm . S t a f f 
unde r took t o prepare regu la r briefings f o r the B o a r d o n the status o f the Government’s 
r e f o rm p r o g r am so that the B o a r d c o u l d reassess the pace and l e v e l o f B a n k support i f 
necessary. 

6. 
T h e C A S envisaged three p i l l a r s o f B a n k support corresponding 
t o the 
ove ra rch ing objectives o f the Government. The B a n k strategy in each o f the three p i l la rs 
was s im i la r . Lending was t o be undertaken in areas where a consensus c o u l d b e reached 
with the Gove rnmen t o n an appropriate p o l i c y f ramewo rk . In other areas whe re the re 
was n o t ye t a consensus, the B a n k w o u l d undertake analytic w o r k t o h e l p m o v e the p o l i c y 
d ia logue fo rwa rd .

Sustained economic growth with greater equity was the f i r s t pillar o f B a n k 
support. 
I t was c lea r ly understood that the p o l i c y d ia logue in this area w o u l d present a 
challenge f o r the B a n k because o f a widespread p u b l i c pe rcep t ion in A rgen t ina that the 
2001-02 c r is is was due, in part, t o p o o r p o l i c y advice f r om abroad. Acco rd ing ly , a m a j o r

reduc t ion and inequa l i ty . The p o l i c y consensus has n o t been su f f ic ien t t o permit an 
Econom ic Recove ry Support SA L , approved by the B o a r d in June 2004, t o m o v e f o rw a r d 
and the l o a n remains unsigned. Howeve r , the Bank has been able t o reach a consensus 
b o t h at the federal l e v e l and at the p r o v i n c i a l l e v e l o n strategies in several areas o f 
in f ras t ruc tu re that are impo r tan t f o r sustained economic g r ow t h with equ i ty and, as a 
result, g o o d progress has been made w i th new inves tmen t lending, p a r t i c u l a r l y in r o a d

Strengthening social inclusion was the second p i l l a r o f B a n k support. Because

Government’s agenda and i t was recep t ive t o B a n k assistance. A l o a n t o h e l p finance a 
p rog ram o f emergency assistance t o unemp loyed heads o f households (Jefes de Hogares)

Promoting better governance was the third p i l l a r o f B a n k support. The 
Gove rnmen t h a d announced amb i t ious plans to imp rove p u b l i c administration, u p h o l d the

Shift toward Investment Lending 

10. 
The CAS envisaged an impo r tan t sh i f t in the compos i t ion o f B a n k lending as 
compared with the recent past when adjustment lending had dom ina ted the p rog ram . The 
view o f the new adm in is t ra t ion was that, in a post-crisis environment, inves tmen t lend ing 
was m o r e in keep ing with Argentina’s development requirements, and i t requested a 
p rog ram in w h i c h investment lend ing w o u l d amount t o 60-75 percent o f the to ta l . The 
shift f r o m adjustment t o inves tmen t lend ing re f lec ted the r e l a t i v e l y l o w p r i o r i t y a t t r ibu ted 
by the Gove rnmen t t o some o f the structural re fo rms w h i c h the B a n k considered 
impo r tan t in order f o r the on -go ing recove ry t o b e sustained. I t was also consistent with 
the views o f c i v i l soc ie ty expressed in C A S consultations that the s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms 
supported by the in te rna t iona l c omm u n i t y in the 1990s con t r ibu ted t o - o r at least did 
l i t t l e t o prevent - the c r is is o f 2001-02. 
11. 
B a n k s ta f f and management we re aware that a shift in the p r o g r am towards 
greater investment l e n d i n g w o u l d pose a challenge. The p ro jec t p repa ra t ion and 
imp lemen ta t ion capab i l i ty o f the A rgen t ine p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion h a d been seriously 
impa i red by, f i rs t , a substantial reduc t ion in p u b l i c inves tmen t during the 1990s and, 
second, the economic c r is is and the recession that preceded i t . Progress with the existing 
investment p o r t f o l i o h a d also been se r ious ly disrupted, and p r o j e c t pe r fo rmance w o u l d

In v i e w o f those concerns, B o a r d presentation o f the C A S was tw i c e postponed

P i l l a r I : Sus ta ined economic g row th w ith greater equity 

Overview 

18. 
Sus ta in ing the recove ry from crisis was at the fo re f ron t o f the Government’s 
p rog ram during 2004-05. 
I t was c lea r ly understood that the recove ry c o u l d o n l y b e 
sustained i f the re was concerted ac t ion o n many fronts. Hence, the f i rs t C A S pillar was 
mu l t i - face ted and the C A S objectives were s im i l a r l y diverse. T h e b r o a d outcomes are 
summarized b e l ow . De ta i ls a re t o be found in A t tachmen t K1. 

19. 
Country outcomes we re v e r y good during 2004-05. Econom ic performance 
exceeded expectations b o t h in terms o f g r ow t h and in t e r m s o f p o v e r t y reduction. A 
B a n k study o n G r o w t h and Equity concluded that f isca l po l ic ies we re indeed pro-poor.2 
Howeve r , economic management in other areas f e l l short o f targets. The re s t i l l rema in 
un reso lved issues conce rn ing the renego t ia t ion o f p u b l i c service concession contracts and 
unce r ta in ty about the regu la to ry f ramewo rk gove rn ing those services. As a resu l t , 
inves tmen t i s recove r ing o n l y s low ly . The f inanc ia l sector has l a r g e l y recovered but 
m a n y banks have c losed their doors and the system i s n o w dom ina ted by p u b l i c l y owned 
banks w h i c h have n o t ye t been restructured. A s far as ex te rna l debt i s concerned, the 
Government nego t ia ted a debt swap f o r 76 percent o f bonds in de fau l t but that s t i l l l e f t 
outstanding some U S $ 2 4 b i l l i o n o f bonds in de fau l t and w i t h o u t any agreement with 
creditors. In addition, some U S $ 4 b i l l i o n in Paris C l u b and other b i l a t e r a l debt remains 
in arrears. 

20. 
CAS outcomes during 2004-05 we re also p o s i t i v e in m a n y respects. P o r t f o l i o 
performance im p r o v e d s ign i f ican t ly and a pipeline o f new inves tmen t p ro jec ts was b u i l t - 
up in the in f ras t ruc tu re sectors. Progress was made towards rees tab l ish ing a dialogue with 
the Federal Gove rnmen t and the Cen t ra l B a n k o n selective issues o f economic 
management. The d ia logue with m a n y p rov inces has been good. 

Macroeconomic Performance 

21. When the C A S was prepared, the A rgen t ine economy was recove r ing s t rong ly 
f r om the 2002 crisis. T o a la rge extent the recove ry cons t i tu ted a rebound f r o m the 
massive decline in G D P that h a d taken p lace during the c r is is and tha t h a d l e f t the 
economy with excess p roduc t ive capac i ty and r e c o r d high unemp loymen t . A massive 
devaluation o f the peso together with a sharp dec l ine in r e a l wages g rea t ly increased the 
competitiveness o f A rgen t ine tradable goods and services. N e t expo r ts increased sharply 
in 2002 due to a m a j o r con t rac t ion o f impo r ts and a m o r e modes t expans ion o f exports.

In addition, merchandise exports bene f i ted f r o m high c omm o d i t y prices. The boost t o 
g r ow t h impa r ted by net exports in 2002 sparked the i n i t i a l rebound in GDP w h i c h 
even tua l ly led t o an expansion o f consump t ion w h i c h hrther fueled the recovery. 

22. 
T h e recove ry progressed even better than anticipated as evidenced by the 
mac roeconom ic ind ica to rs in Tab le 1 be low . Whereas, in the CAS, rea l g r ow t h h a d been 
estimated at 8 percent in 2003 and 6.5 percent in 2004, the actual outcomes tu rned ou t t o 
b e 8.8 pe rcen t and 9 percent respectively. Mac roeconom ic performance in 2005 
con t inued t o b e good. G r ow t h i s p ro jec ted t o be in the 8 percent range. Trade has also 
con t inued t o g row , with exports increasing by 17 percent in U S do l la r terms in 2004. In 
2005 the re was a further 12 percent increase in exports and a favorable balance o f trade 
estimated at some U S $ 9 b i l l i o n . 

23. Within the context o f a strong recovery, f isca l performance has also exceeded 
expectations. T h e r a t i o o f revenues t o GDP has been buoyan t in pa r t because o f s t rong 
g r ow t h and also because o f im p r o v e d tax co l lec t ion . The new taxes that h a d been 
in t roduced o n exports and o n f inanc ia l transactions after the c r is is n o w account f o r about 
18 percent o f federal revenue. As a result, the p r im a r y surplus o f the consolidated p u b l i c 
sector reached 5.1 percent o f GDP in 2004 and i t i s p ro jec ted at 4.5 percent in 2005. A 
d isc ip l ined f isca l and mone ta ry p o l i c y has kep t under con t ro l the in f la t iona ry impac t o f a 
massive deva lua t ion so that, after an i n i t i a l 4 1 percent surge in p r ices in 2002 
immed ia te ly f o l l o w i n g the devaluation, consumer p r ices rose by o n l y 3.7 percent in 2003 
and by 4.4 percent in 2004 (measured year-end). Howeve r , with the approach o f 
congressional elections, the pressure o n p r ices began t o increase again in 2005 and 
i n f l a t i o n i s expected t o reach doub le digits. 

24. 
The recove ry has n o t o n l y been strong, but p ro -poo r as w e l l . Pove r ty rates during 
2003 and 2004 fe l l b e l ow the rate spec i f ied in the CAS coun t ry pe r fo rmance ind ica to rs . 
Whereas the CAS p rog ram m a t r i x h a d targeted a reduc t ion in the l e v e l o f p o v e r t y f r o m 
5 5 percent in 2003 t o 48 percent in 2005, the p o v e r t y l e v e l h a d already been reduced t o 
38.5 percent by the third quarter o f 2005. S im i la r ly , extreme pove r ty was already 
reduced t o an estimated 14 percent in the third quarter o f 2005 - w e l l b e l ow the 2 1 
percent m a t r i x target. Unemp loymen t was reduced t o 17 percent in 2004 ( inc lud ing as 
unemp loyed those Jefes p rog ram bene f ic ia r ies tha t are pa r t ic ipa t ing in wo rk fa re and 
searching f o r employment) and t o a further 12.5 percent as o f the third quarter o f 2005. 

25. 
Yet despite the progress, p o v e r t y s t i l l rema ins a p r o b l em in A rgen t ina . T h e 38 
percent l e v e l estimated f o r 2005 was s t i l l h i g h e r t h a n the pre-recession l e v e l o f 3 0 percent 
in 1998. L ikew ise , the incidence o f extreme pove r ty , estimated at 13 percent in 2005, 
remains high. 
I n e q u a l i t y has increased, as documented by the B a n k study en t i t led 
“Seeking Sustained g r ow t h and Soc ia l Equity” (Report N o . 32553 -AR ) . 

26. 
There are o the r caveats t o the ove ra l l g o o d econom ic pe r fo rmance o f the past t w o 
years. Pa r t icu la r ly w o r r y i n g i s the reemergence o f i n f l a t i o n . M o s t observers expect a

A m a j o r ob jec t ive o f the Government in the p e r i o d 2004-05 was t o reach an 
agreement w i th bondho lde rs that w o u l d resolve outstanding i s s u e s s temm ing f r om the 
de fau l t o n p u b l i c debt. The process was protracted, beginning at the 2003 IM F - B a n k 
annual meetings in D u b a i when the Government ou t l ined an i n i t i a l debt exchange 
p roposa l that was p o o r l y rece ived by p r iva te bondholders. A somewhat m o r e favorable 
debt res t ruc tu r ing o f f e r was fo rma l ly launched by A rgen t ina in January 2005 and, in June 
2005, the Gove rnmen t announced that 76 percent o f a l l eligible debt h a d been exchanged, 
m a k i n g i t the largest debt wo rk -ou t o n record. In NPV terms, the exchanged debt h a d 
been reduced by 75 percent at a discount rate o f 10 percent. As a result, the to ta l p u b l i c 
debt was reduced f r o m US$191.3 b i l l i o n as o f end 2004 t o US$126 .6 b i l l i o n as o f April 
2005 (exc lud ing cap i ta l and interest in de fau l t h e l d by debt res t ruc tu r ing ho ldou ts o f 
about US $ 2 4 b i l l i o n ) . Measu red as a percentage o f GDP, p u b l i c debt dec l ined f r o m 125 
percent as o f end 2004 t o about 73 percent using the 2005 GDP estimate. The approach 
pursued by the Gove rnmen t t o debt res t ruc tu r ing was w i d e l y pe rce ived as con f ron ta t iona l 
by bondho lde rs and the settlement s t i l l l e f t outstanding some U S $ 2 4 b i l l i o n o f bonds in 
de fau l t and w i t h o u t any agreement with creditors. In addition, some U S $ 4 b i l l i o n in 
Paris C l u b and o the r b i la te ra l debt remains in arrears. Hence, the C A S performance 
ind ica to r that envisaged the conc lus ion o f p u b l i c debt res t ruc tu r ing in 2004 was l e s s than 
fully me t .

The economic c r is is o f 2001 -02 had pa r t icu la r ly serious consequences f o r the 
f inanc ia l sector. W h e n the C o n v e r t i b i l i t y P l a n was abandoned and the peso f e l l t o one 
third o f i t s p rev ious value, many f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions we re caught w i th a serious 
cu r rency m isma tch be tween assets and l iab i l i t ies . Their plight was exacerbated when, by 
government decree, do l la r -denom ina ted assets and l i a b i l i t i e s we re conve r ted t o pesos at 
different exchange rates ( k n ow n as “asymmetric pesification”). Further losses were 
incu r red as a resu l t o f asymmetric indexa t ion whe reby deposits we re indexed t o 
consumer prices while some loans we re indexed t o wages. Tempo ra ry p ro tec t ion was 
p rov ided to f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions w h e n the Gove rnmen t in t roduced measures t o res t r ic t 
the w i thd rawa l o f deposits ( k n ow n as the “co r ra l i to ” and the “corralon”) but that 
p ro tec t ion came at the cost o f further e rod ing p u b l i c con f idence in the f inanc ia l system 
and i t was n o t wa te r - t igh t . In some cases, depositors we re able t o secure cou r t orders 
(amparos) f o r the release o f f rozen deposits at the p r e v a i l i n g ma rke t exchange rate o f 3 
pesos to the dollar.

A c k n ow l e d g i n g the central importance o f a we l l - func t ion ing f inanc ia l sector f o r

the B a n k h a d occasion t o p a r t i a l l y reopen the dialogue when, o n the advice o f Execu t ive 
D i rec to rs , the Econom ic Recove ry Support SAL was renegotiated. That dialogue was n o t 
sustained because o f the delay in loan signing. Howeve r , m o r e recently, the Cen t ra l

G o o d progress i s being made with respect t o coun t ry performance ind ica to rs f o r 
the f inanc ia l sector. A short te rm ob jec t ive a r t icu la ted in the C A S was that full

asymme t r ic pes i f ica t ion o f domestic do l la r denominated l iab i l i t ies . A l s o as o f end-

P ruden t ia l regu la t ions are n o w b e i n g reinstated g radua l ly in accordance with the f inanc ia l

Infrastructure 

39. 
The B a n k has a long -s tand ing association w i th in f ras t ruc tu re development in 
A rgen t ina that continues today. The acute recession w h i c h began in 1998 and w h i c h 
cu lm ina ted in the economic c r is is o f 2001-02 h a d a serious impac t u p o n the sector. First, 
the squeeze o n budget resources resulted in a sharp reduc t ion o f inves tmen t and s lowe r

contracts that had been predicated u p o n the do l la r and the peso b e i n g interchangeable at

in the f o l l ow i n g section. This section i s concerned with issues o f inves tmen t and 
maintenance in phys ica l infrastructure. 

40. 
The C A S p rog ram m a t r i x spec i f ied a number o f coun t ry pe r fo rmance ind ica to rs 
as m e d i um te rm goals. As fa r as roads are concerned, the ob jec t ive was that 9 0 percent

be in good cond i t ion within a p e r i o d o f f i v e years. By 2004, some 9 2 percent o f na t iona l 
non-concessioned roads were 
found t o b e in “good o r fa i r ” c o n d i t i o n and the 
corresponding percentage f o r p r o v i n c i a l non-concessioned roads was 86 percent. A 
b reakdown be tween “good” and “ fa i r ” 
i s n o t cu r ren t ly available. M e d i um - t e rm goals 
were also specified f o r water supply, sewerage services, gas and e lec t r ic p ow e r whe re the 
emphasis was u p o n inc reas ing the a v a i l a b i l i t y o f service t o the poo r . Progress with those 
pe r fo rmance ind ica to rs has been s low . At the present junc tu re i t i s d i f f i c u l t t o compare

December 2004 f o r an in f ras t ruc tu re APL in the p rov ince o f Buenos Aires. I t inc luded

Ano the r endeavor i d e n t i f i e d in the C A S as being o f cen t ra l impo r tance f o r

51. 
There has been no tab le progress in the r e v i v a l o f the p r iva te sector since the

d i T e l l a are evidence that the C A S pe r fo rmance ind ica to rs have im p r o v e d greatly. T h e 
consumer confidence index stood at 49.9 in September 2005 compared w i th a l o w o f 28.4 
in September 2002. S im i la r ly , the index o f demand f o r labo r rose f r o m 48 in September

In 2004-05 the u pw a r d trend

52. 
Other coun t ry pe r fo rmance ind ica to rs have also shown progress. P r iva te sector

US$34 .6 b i l l i o n in 2004 and by a fu r the r estimated 17 percent in 2005 . . Furthermore, new 
markets were penetrated. Me rchand ise exports t o destinations other than M ERCO SUR , 
NAFTA and the EU have accounted f o r a s tead i ly inc reas ing share o f the to ta l . They

reduced t o 7 contracts f o r US$60 .9 m i l l i o n gross and US$35.5 ne t . 

60. 
Three factors accounted f o r the reduc t ion in MIGA’s coun t ry exposure. Some

As the recove ry gained s t e am and c r is is -d r iven pressures we re reduced, the Gove rnmen t 
was able t o focus once m o r e o n longe r t e r m issues o f educa t ion and health. The C A S 
sought t o support the Gove rnmen t in these endeavors. De ta i ls o f C A S objectives and

72. 
Country outcomes revea l good progress in 2004-05. Em p l o ym e n t has expanded 
so that fewer peop le need pa r t ic ipa te in wo rk fa re programs. In pa r t icu la r , there has been 
a reduc t ion in y o u t h unemp loymen t and a reduc t ion o f unemp loymen t f o r the lowes t 
income quintile. In the hea l th sector, the coverage o f vacc ina t ions has been ma in ta ined 
at 95 percent and a ma te rna l -ch i ld hea l th insurance scheme has been successfully 
introduced. 
In education, p r e l im i n a r y data f o r 2004 ind ica tes that secondary school 
en ro l lmen t has increased and repe t i t ion rates have been reduced.

In the medium-term the C A S l o o k e d t o an im p r o v e d p u b l i c pe rcep t ion o f integrity 
as ind ica ted by the ranking o f A rgen t ina within the index o f Transparency In te rna t iona l . 
Be tween 2003 and 2004 A rgen t ina re ta ined the same 2.5 score within the Co r rup t ion 
Perceptions I n d e x (published each October) but, because o f an increase in the numbe r o f 
coun t r ies considered and an imp rovemen t in the score o f some other countries, f e l l in 
r a n k f r o m 92 t o 108. The 2005 score was 2.8. Transparency In te rna t iona l characterizes a 
score o f l e s s than 3 po in ts ou t o f 10 as ind ica t ive o f “rampant co r rup t ion ” wh ich , in turn, 
i s de f ined as “the use o f p u b l i c o f f i c e f o r p r iva te benefit”. 

100. A repo r t by the A rgen t ine undersecretary o f p u b l i c management, also published in 
October 2004, cites the p o o r p ro fess iona l l e v e l o f m u c h o f the p u b l i c sector as an 
impediment t o e f fec t ive adm in is t ra t ion and economic development. In the m in is t r ies o f 
hea l th and soc ia l development, f o r example, the p r o p o r t i o n o f employees w i th l e s s than 
full secondary school education amount t o 46 and 40 percent respectively. T h e l o w l e v e l

101. O n the other hand, other surveys are less nega t ive in the i r results. A c c o r d i n g t o

Furthermore, o n l y 6 percent considered the present Government t o be m o r e co r rup t than 
others in the p rev ious 2 0 year pe r iod .

mode rn iza t ion i n v o l v i n g a limited number o f in i t ia t ives in selected agencies, in contrast 
to the m o r e sweeping, but sometimes unsuccessful r e f o rm in i t ia t ives o f the past. T h e

techn ica l assistance l o a n (TAL) f o r AN S E S , the soc ia l secu r i ty adm in is t ra t ion , was

103. P u b l i c expenditure management was another area o f focus f o r the CAS. With

agencies using the updated system o f integrated f inanc ia l management f o r in te rna l

s ign i f ican t progress. The number o f agencies using the system rose f r o m seven in 2002 
t o 4 1 in 2004 and h r t h e r t o 5 2 in 2005. The FOS IP p ro jec t also he lped develop a new 
system f o r the iden t i f ica t ion , preparation, management and eva lua t ion o f p u b l i c

system has been p rov ided for 752 p u b l i c employees and 800 p r iva te sector participants. 

104. F i d u c i a r y weaknesses in the management o f the FOSIP p ro jec t we re identified 
during ex-post supe rv is ion m iss ions in 2005 and the B a n k has engaged the Government 
t o address these. Strengthened f iduc ia ry measures are being inco rpo ra ted in the f o l l ow -

105. The comp le t ion o f an integrated reg is t ry o f government pe rsonne l was another

in the CAS. By end-2005, the Government expects t o have a l l the

Enhancing effective decentralization 

106. The federal structure o f A rgen t ina and the t rad i t iona l strength o f p r o v i n c i a l 
loya l t ies mean that decen t ra l iza t ion i s an issue o f cen t ra l impo r tance f o r e f fec t ive

In the absence o f na t ion -w ide standards, the B a n k p ro jec t has

107. The p r o v i n c i a l deve lopmen t p ro jec t has p l a y e d an impo r tan t r o l e in suppo r t ing

Im p r o v e d tax adm in is t ra t ion has l e d t o be t te r tax-payer

In the aftermath o f the 2001-02 crisis, i t was an t ic ipa ted that the Government 
w o u l d enact a new co -pa r t ic ipa t ion l a w gove rn ing the d is t r ibu t ion o f f isca l revenues

env i ronmen t in A rgen t ina . There was widespread p u b l i c pe rcep t ion that the 2001-02 
economic c r is is was due, in part, t o p o o r p o l i c y adv ice f r o m abroad. T h e h i g h - p r o f i l e 
presence o f the IMF together with a number o f la rge po l icy -based loans f r o m the B a n k 
h a d resulted in “po l icy - re fo rm fatigue”. There was oppos i t ion and even ou t r igh t re jec t ion

112. T h e C A S c lea r ly stated the in ten t ion o f the B a n k “ t o fo l low the understanding

m u l t i l a t e r a l lenders w o u l d ma in ta in the i r exposure constant th rough exp i ra t ion of 
the 
stand-by a r rangemen t in 2006” (para. 11 1). Tha t understanding f e l l i n t o abeyance w h e n 
the third IMF r e v i ew o f the stand-by arrangement was postponed indefinitely. Given the 
mac roeconom ic uncertainties created by the absence o f an active IMF program, the Bank 
was n o t able t o disburse po l icy -based lending such as the ERSAL. Inves tmen t lend ing 
alone was n o t sufficient t o ma in ta in the Bank ’s exposure, no tw i ths tand ing a successful 
e f f o r t t o im p r o v e p o r t f o l i o pe r fo rmance and build-up the p ro jec t p ipe l ine . As a result, the 
Bank ’s exposure in A rgen t ina (bo r rowe r ob l iga t ion ) f e l l f r o m US$7.5 b i l l i o n at end-2003 
t o US$7 .4 b i l l i o n at end-2004 and t o US$7 .0 b i l l i o n at end-September 2005. 

113. No tw i ths tand ing that l im i ta t ion , the B a n k was able t o engage in an ac t ive and 
fruithl d ia logue with a number o f sector m in is t r ies and with p r o v i n c i a l governments 
where the B a n k had an ac t ive operations p rog ram . As a resu l t o f that dialogue, the 
pe r fo rmance o f operations in the Bank p o r t f o l i o g rea t ly imp roved . Many p r o b l em

w h i c h shows a decisive reduc t ion in the numbe r o f p r o b l em projects in 2004-05.

and the subsequent economic crisis, w h i c h l e d t o fu r the r reductions in the cap i ta l budget. 
This has ra ised d i f f i c u l t i e s f o r the Bank , p a r t i c u l a r l y in the con tex t o f an inves tmen t l e d

Ministry o f E c o n om y and P roduc t ion as well as other core m in is t r ies o f the Fede ra l 
Gove rnmen t has been l im i ted . P roduc t ive engagement has been possible with some 
p r o v i n c i a l authorities and the p r iva te sector has been recep t ive t o a d ia logue with the 
Bank . As imp lemen ta t ion o f the CAS progressed, the B a n k responded t o a constrained 
p o l i c y d ia logue by focus ing i t s ana ly t ic w o r k o n issues where the Gove rnmen t h a d 
expressed in te res t and by unde r tak ing the ana ly t ic w o r k in coope ra t ion with the 
authorities. Within that f ramewo rk a study o n G r o w t h and Equity was designed with an

o p t im a l w i th respect t o the development o f the inves tmen t p ro jec t pipeline. In the p e r i o d 
2004-05, B a n k s t a f f was able t o develop n ew p ro jec ts in sectors where there we re 
ongo ing operations. The operational strategy was adapted to make u s e o f the APL as an 
ins t rumen t tha t enables the Bank t o w o r k within the limited resource envelope 
co r respond ing t o a short p e r i o d o f lending au tho r iza t ion and where the sector f ramewo rk

0 Lesson: F o r the B a n k t o build up a strong p ro jec t p ipe l ine i t needs t o adopt a

122. T h e Government’s p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion capac i ty remains limited. This raises 
d i f f i c u l t i e s f o r the Bank, pa r t icu la r ly in the con tex t o f an investment led strategy in w h i c h 
the p o r t f o l i o o f inves tmen t p ro jec ts i s being a lmos t comp le te ly rebuilt. I t c o u l d also lead

imp lemen ta t ion units (PIUs) i n t o regu la r l i n e units within the Gove rnmen t . The re 
has been some good progress in t h i s area. 

123. T h e CAS identified a numbe r o f “excep t iona l r i s k s ” at the coun t ry and ope ra t iona l 
level, including p o l i t i c a l and systemic r i s k s . I t conc luded that t h e fiduciary f ramewo rk

124. Ano the r source o f unce r ta in ty during 2004-05 has been the lack o f a clear medium-

perspective, i t i s unclear whether the strong economic performance o f the past two years can 
s e r v e as a guide to fb tu re growth. The experience o f 2004-05 vindicates the v iew expressed 
in the 2004 CAS (page iii o f Executive Summary) that “A l though the s i tua t ion i n A rgen t ina
