This Coun t ry Partnership Strategy has been prepared together with the Government and 
w i t h the European Commission’s 2007-2013 Country Strategy Paper. This j o i n t wo rk i s 
part o f the ha rmon iza t ion agenda, f o l l ow i n g the presentation o f the r e f o rm p rog ram o f the 
Government o f Mau r i t ius . I t includes a shared diagnostic and r e s u l t s m a t r i x . The 
European Comm iss ion and the W o r l d Bank have also agreed to undertake j o i n t 
implementation by supporting common programs and ca r ry ing ou t j o i n t evaluations and 
m id - te rm rev iew . 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

(i) 

Since independence in 1968, M a u r i t i u s has achieved remarkable economic and 
social success, based o n good governance, exceptional u s e o f p re fe ren t ia l trade agreements 
fo r i ts sugar and tex t i le exports, and the development o f strong t o u r i sm and f inanc ia l 
services industries. At independence, the coun t ry was poor, with a per capita income o f 
about US$260. Today, per capita income i s US$5,250, the second highest in the A f r i c a 
reg ion after Seychelles, with good social indicators. 

(ii) However, while economic performance remains good by in te rna t iona l standards, 
Mau r i t ius i s fac ing s ign i f ican t economic and social challenges as i t i s fo rced t o t rans i t ion 
f r om dependence o n trade preferences to open compe t i t ion in the g loba l economy. 
Average g r ow t h has s lowed f r om over 7.5 percent in the second h a l f o f the 1980s t o 3 .5 
percent du r ing the past five years. The f isca l de f ic i t i s estimated at 5.4 percent o f GDP fo r 
FYOY06 . And unemp loymen t (currently at 8-10 percent) i s o n the r ise due t o a m isma tch 
in labor s k i l l s and labor ma rke t r ig id i t ies . The country’s challenge i s n o w to boost 
economic g r ow t h th rough higher p roduc t iv i ty ; develop human capital th rough education 
re fo rm to raise s k i l l levels; p romo te n ew emerging sectors and move M a u r i t i u s t o a mo re 
knowledge based economy while preserving i t s l o n g standing comm i tmen t to social 
we1 far e, 

(iii) 

T o address these challenges, the Government o f M a u r i t i u s has l a i d out a p l a n to get 
Mau r i t ius back o n a high g r ow t h path, and p ro tec t Mau r i t ians who are be ing nega t ive ly 
affected by the transition. The r e f o rm p rog ram presented in the budget o n June 9 ,2006 
has fou r p i l la rs : (i) F isca l Conso l ida t ion and Im p r o v e d Pub l ic Sector E f f ic iency ; (ii) 
Im p r o v i n g Trade Competitiveness; (iii) Im p r o v i n g the Investment Climate; and (iv) 
Democ ra t iz ing the Economy th rough participation, social inc lus ion and sustainability. The 
new r e f o rm p rog ram lays out an impressive roadmap in addressing the challenges ahead by 
l ibe ra l iz ing the economy, im p r o v i n g the p u b l i c sector, re fo rm ing the tax base, p romo t ing 
investment, and establishing a new social program. The challenge i s t o n o w develop sector 
programs and implement re fo rm . 

(iv) Given the magnitude o f the country’s economic and social challenges, the 
Government has asked f o r increased support f r om the W o r l d Bank, especially in terms o f 
the p rov is ion o f knowledge, and f r om the European U n i o n (EU), with w h om the coun t ry 
has had longstanding trade ties and assistance th rough the European Development Fund. 

(v) 
This FY07- 13 Coun t ry Partnership Strategy (CPS) i s based o n t h r e e gu id ing 
p r inc ip les : (i) a l ignmen t with the Government Program; (ii) f l e x i b i l i t y ; and (iii) 
harmonization. I t has been developed in close co l labo ra t ion with the Government o f 
Mau r i t ius and the European U n i o n to ensure that i t responds to the country’s emerging 
needs, and reflects a coherent approach o f Mau r i t ius ’ ma jo r development partners. This 
CPS builds o n lessons learned f r om previous B a n k experience in M a u r i t i u s and o n the 
f lex ib le approaches developed e lsewhere in the Bank fo r M idd le - Income Countries. I t i s 
grounded in the Bank ’s recogn i t ion that i t needs t o adapt i t s business m o d e l to Mau r i t ius ’ 
development agenda, and the Government’s recogn i t ion that the Bank brings m u c h mo re 
than f inanc ia l resources to the table. 

i 

(vi) 
The CPS takes as a s ta r t ing p o i n t the fou r p i l la rs o f the Government’s strategy. 
Details o f the Bank G roup p rog ram in M a u r i t i u s w i l l be se t ou t each year in an A n n u a l 
Business P lan (ABP ) . The ABP w i l l be developed in pa ra l le l with the Government’s 
annual p lann ing and budget processes to ensu re that the Bank i s fu l ly in step with 
Mau r i t ius ’ development agenda, and w i t h other donors’ support. 

(v i i) The CPS ob jec t ive i s to help the Government deal with sho r t - te rm trade shocks and 
the t rans i t ion to a mo re compe t i t ive and sophisticated economy, while m i n im i z i n g negative 
social impacts. I t i s built a round a results f ramewo rk o u t l i n i n g a b road l i s t o f po ten t ia l 
outcomes agreed with the Government o f Mau r i t ius and the EU. Howeve r , because the 
CPS s e t s out a b road program, the elements o f w h i c h w i l l be determined every year 
through Annua l Business Plans, i t i s n o t expected that the Bank w i l l con t r ibu te t o a l l o f the 
p re - iden t i f ied outcomes, bu t o n l y to those in w h i c h i t w i l l be invo lved . 

(v i i i ) 
The Government has ind ica ted i t s i n t e r e s t in a range o f B a n k instruments to help i t 
implement i t s r e f o rm p rog ram and achieve i ts strategic objectives ove r the next seven 
years. F i rs t , the Gove rnmen t has requested a s e r i e s o f annual development p o l i c y loans 
(DPLs) to help implement k e y facets o f the r e f o rm program, f o r an expected IBRD amount 
o f U S $ 3 0 m i l l i o n each, starting f r om FY 0 7 . This budget support p r o g r am w i l l b e done 
j o i n t l y with other development partners, pa r t icu la r ly the EU, France, and the A f r i c a n 
Development Bank . Second, the Government has requested in f ras t ruc tu re investment 
loans, fo r w h i c h co f inanc ing w i l l also be sought, no tab ly with the EIB. Th i rd , the 
Government w o u l d like ana ly t ica l and advisory w o r k to continue and intensify. To 
support the Government’s research needs, the Bank i s pu t t ing in p lace a R a p i d Response 
Fac i l i ty and the EU a Techn ica l Coope ra t ion Fac i l i ty . The t w o ins t i tu t ions are exp lo r ing 
with Government the p o s s i b i l i t y o f a Joint AAA fund ing arrangement t o create a coherent 
EU /W o r l d Bank f ramewo rk f o r technical assistance and ana ly t ica l w o r k f o r the 
Government’s r e f o rm p rog ram . I t i s hoped that this arrangement w i l l catalyze add i t iona l 
resources fo r analytical wo rk , and be done j o i n t l y with Government. F i n a l l y , over the CPS 
period, the Government w i l l be seeking increased partnerships with the other parts o f the 
Bank G roup ( IFC ,and MIGA), t o assist in the m o b i l i z a t i o n o f p r iva te investment. 

( ix ) 
The strategy faces several key risks, the mos t impo r tan t o f w h i c h are as fo l lows . 
F i rs t , there may be erosion o f support fo r the r e f o rm p rog ram in light o f the d i f f i c u l t 
transition. The Bank w i l l m o n i t o r the s i tua t ion and adjust the p rog ram as necessary. 
Second, there i s a risk that the Government may n o t b o r r ow f r om the Bank . T o better 
manage the w o r k p rog ram and adjust i f the Government does o r does n o t bo r row , the Bank 
and Government have agreed t o p l a n and review the w o r k p rog ram o n an annual basis. 
F ina l ly , there i s a risk that the B a n k m a y n o t be able t o meet the expectations o f the client, 
especially as far as the ana ly t ica l and advisory w o r k i s concerned. The demand o f the 
M a u r i t i a n Government f o r the Bank ’s services cu r ren t ly exceeds wha t the B a n k can 
reasonably finance ou t o f i t s operational budget. Therefore, this strategy proposes the 
creation o f the j o i n t donor-government AAA fund tha t can finance ana ly t ica l w o r k and 
technical assistance t o m e e t the government’s research and capacity needs .

Average GDP growth fo r the same period was 6 percent. 
Mauritius has been a parliamentary democracy based on the Westminster system o f democracy model s ince 
independence i n 1968. National and l o c a l elections are held every five years under the supervision o f an 
independent Electoral Commission. The po l i t ica l landscape consists o f numerous po l i t ica l parties, both small 
and large. Mauritius has an independent judiciary based on a combination o f English Common Law and the 
Napoleonic Code. 
Mauritius ranks 5 1 out o f 158 country rankings in the 2005 Transparency International Corruption 
Perception Index, th ird in the A fr ica region a f t e r Botswana and South Africa.

4. 
So far, trade preference erosion has ma in ly affected the c lo th ing sector. M a u r i t i u s i s 
a re la t ive ly high-wage country, and with the end o f the Multi-fiber Ag reemen t (MFA) in 
January 2005 i t i s no longe r able to compete in t rad i t iona l ma rke t segments. As a resu l t , 
the export processing zones (EPZ) apparel sector has downsized by over a third in the past 
several years. A s im i la r fate l i k e l y awaits i t s sugar sector when the EU begins 
imp lemen t ing p r ice cuts in 2006, leading to a sugar p r ice reduc t ion by 36 percent by 2009. 
Meanwhile, the r i s e in o i l prices f r om $24/bbl in 2002 to m o r e than $70 /bb l in early 2006 
has added nearly 4 percent o f GDP t o the annual o i l im p o r t b i l l . F r o m 2003 t o 2005, i t s 
terms o f trade deteriorated by nea r ly 15 percent, equivalent to a massive 10 percent o f 
GDP . In addition, export g r ow t h has been depressed further by s lugg ish economic 
conditions and weak im p o r t demand f r om Europe, w h i c h i s M a u r i t i u s ’ m a i n t rad ing 
partner. 

5 . 

The combined effect o f these developments has been a s l ow d ow n o f g r ow t h f r om 
5 -6 percent in the late 1990s to 3-4 percent over the last five years. Expo r ts have stagnated 
in real terms, and p r o d u c t i v i t y g r ow t h has slowed sharply. In 2005, t h e g r ow t h rate slowed 
further t o just 2.5 percent, as a poo r sugar harvest co inc ided with a sharp con t rac t ion o f the 
EPZ. The creation o f new j o b s has n o t been fast enough to prevent an increase in 
unemployment. Domes t ic investment has fallen, the current account has deteriorated 
sharply and fo re ign exchange rese rves have fallen. Fixed investment slumped t o an 
average o f j u s t 22 percent o f GDP in 2001-2005 f r om as m u c h as 30 percent in the mid- 
1990s; b o t h pub l ic and p r iva te investment shared in the retrenchment, except fo r a br ie f 
spike in pub l ic investment in 2003 associated with the Government’s New Econom ic 
Agenda and construction o f a Cybe r Towe r and business pa rk i n c l u d i n g an I C T 
infrastructure p la t fo rm . 

6. 
Mau r i t ius ’ economic success has translated i n t o welfare improvements, but these 
achievements are under threat. The incidence o f absolute pove r ty i s re la t ive ly low , 
although pockets s t i l l p r e v a i l in some suburban and coastal regions in M a u r i t i u s and o n the 
Is land o f Rodrigues, and ce r ta in groups have remained ma rg ina l ized . Some 12 percent o f 
the popu la t ion i s estimated t o be poor, based o n a pove r ty benchma rk calculated at 50 
percent o f the med ian m o n t h l y household expenditure. Acco rd ing t o the Househo ld Survey 
(2001 -20024), 10.2 percent o f households were earning l e s s than Rs 5000 (about US$154) 
a month. S ign i f ican t gender and reg iona l differences exist. The inc idence o f pove r ty i s 
re la t ive ly higher among female-headed households (33 .8 percent) than among ma le headed 
households (8 percent). O n the is land o f Rodrigues, the pove r ty rate i s 30.2 percent. The 
incidence o f pove r ty in r u r a l areas i s mo re than three times that o f u rban areas.

13. 
Th i rd , c r i t ica l lapses in education and barriers t o hiring fo re ign wo rke rs have 
created shortages o f people w i th essential technical and managerial sk i l ls . M a u r i t i u s i s

compete e f fec t ive ly in tou r ism and ho te l management, o f f sho r ing and I C T businesses and 
other dynamic g loba l industries. At the heart o f the problems in education i s the fact that 
on ly two - th i rds o f ch i ld ren reach secondary school, o n l y 36 percent complete h i g h school 
and on ly 14 percent ob ta in tertiary qua l i f ica t ions compared with about 40 t o 60 percent fo r 
countries at s im i la r PPP income per capita. 

14. 
Fou r th , bureaucratic procedures, red tape and co r rup t ion h i g h l i g h t the need fo r 
pub l ic sector re fo rm . Greater e f f ic iency i s needed at a time when there are exceptional 
demands f o r social spending, t rans i t iona l support and investments in infrastructure, bu t 
pub l ic sector debt o f around 70 percent’ o f GDP i s constraining f isca l space. Poo r fiscal

costly tax expenditures and p o o r l y targeted subsidy programs a l l con t r ibu te to l o w ove ra l l 
public-sector e f f ic iency . 

15. 
Other challenges. Apa r t f r om the need fo r economic re fo rm , the coun t ry also 
faces social challenges. Mau r i t ius ’ developmental success i s built o n social cohesion. With 
the r i s e o f unemployment and educational inequalities the res t ruc tu r ing o f the economy 
may risk increasing the pove r ty among ce r ta in segments o f the population, un less 
appropriate and well targeted social safety n e t s are put in place. 

16. 
In the health sector, the ove ra l l indicators are good. But M a u r i t i u s has the second 
highest prevalence rate o f diabetes in the wo r ld , and H I V / A I D S incidence, though 
re la t ive ly low , has been rising, pa r t icu la r ly among drug use rs . I t i s estimated that the re are 
some 18,000 in jec t ing drug use rs in Mau r i t ius , and that some 13 percent o f these are 
infected with H I V / A I D S virus. W i t h o u t sustained and determined ac t ion n o w HIVIAIDS 
cou ld soar w i t h i n a decade as has been observed in other countries with s im i la r p ro f i les . 

17. 
Environmental challenges are also impo r tan t . Tou r ism has p roved t o be a re l iab le 
p i l l a r o f growth, but the country’s goals o f nea r ly t r i p l i n g arrivals t o t w o m i l l i o n over the

resources. The environmental imp l ica t ions o f w i thd raw ing s ign i f ican t amounts o f land

exposed to climate change, cyclones, and r i s i n g sea l e v e l s , requ i r ing disaster management 
and early wa rn ing systems. M a u r i t i u s also faces a risk o f o i l s p i l l s , w h i c h w o u l d threaten

Government’s Actions to Date 

22. 
Since the pub l ica t ion o f the long - te rm prospective study, V is ion 2020, in the mid-

depends o n m o v i n g away f r om low-wage, labor-intensive commod i t ies exports to more 
skilled, h i g h value-added, knowledge-based services. The coun t ry has taken many steps 
towards rea l iz ing this v is ion , inc lud ing restructuring the sugar and tex t i les sectors; 
establishing an o f fsho re f inanc ia l sector u t i l i z i n g a ne two rk o f double tax treaties;

A second phase o f the p rog ram w i l l tackle the h i g h cost o f services. The cost o f 
International Private Leased C i rcu i ts w i l l be reduced by 2 5 percent immediately, while 
increasing compe t i t ion and strengthening the telecommunications regulator ( ICTA ) w i l l 
promote more cost-effective supply in the future. Other measures c a l l f o r l ibe ra l iz ing a i r

In preparation o f this Coun t ry Partnership Strategy, the B a n k ca r r ied ou t a 
Comp le t ion Report o f the p rev ious FY02-04 C A S (Annex 2). Several impo r tan t lessons 
f r om this analysis have been factored i n t o the design o f this Strategy. In terms o f ove ra l l 
approach, the alignment o f the Bank ’s assistance to the Government’s p r o g r am wo rked 
well as the Bank’s ac t iv i t ies were strategically relevant and led to r e s u l t s . However, 
predetermining a mu l t iyea r p rog ram did n o t w o r k well, as the Bank ’s w o r k over the C A S 
pe r iod diverged f r om what was planned. In particular, the Government did n o t b o r r ow tw o 
out o f the t h r e e expected loans, and the ana ly t ica l w o r k that was ca r r ied ou t differed f r om 
what had been planned. 

Box 1: M a in Recommendations from the CAS Completion Report 

1 . The Bank should continue to align i t s program to the Government’s. 
2 . 
I t should use a more flexible approach in i t s work w i th Mauritius through a jo in t Annual 
Business Planning process, 
3 . The Results Framework should be realistic and linked to areas where the Bank can have 
impact. 
4. Additional resources fo r A A A work should be leveraged over and above the Bank’s budget. 
5 . Greater emphasis should be given on dissemination o f findings o f analytical work and 
collaboration w i th other donors. 
6 . A l l arms o f the World Bank group should support an integrated program. 
7. A one-person l ia ison o f f i c e in Port Louis should be established to maintain regular dialogue 
and outreach efforts.

The Government has signaled i t s strong interest in the Bank’s ana ly t ica l and 
advisory services and p o l i c y advice o n key strategic issues. The specific services designed 
to respond to Government’s know ledge needs w i l l be agreed u p o n as pa r t o f the annual 
business-planning process. The B a n k and the EU intend t o s e t a mechanism f o r j o i n t

This fund w i l l finance analytical and technical assistance w o r k i n v o l v i n g l o c a l research

also i s prepared to b o r r ow f o r investment operations, but i t w o u l d like these t o be

investment loans are l i k e l y t o be pa r t o f broader f inanc ing packages i n v o l v i n g the 
European Investment B a n k (EIB), AfDB and other financiers. The I F C i s expected t o be a

1 Bo x 2 : Development Policy Loans 

The Bank’s budget support consists o f a series o f Development Policy L o a n s (DPLs), starting with a 
US30 million Trade and Competitiveness DPL in FY07. The loans provide a framework among 
Government and major development partners (EU, France, and African Development Bank) to 
support the Government’s objective t o boost growth and remain competitive while protecting the 
vulnerable, by implementing structural reforms in public sector management, industrial regulation, 
labor relations and provision o f social safety nets. 

The first DPL w i l l support a broad array o f strategically important measures including: 
Fiscal consolidation including allocation o f budgets according to preset ceilings, reducing t a r i f f 
protection as a first step toward making Mauritius a duty-free island, and reconfiguring 
subsidies on rice and flour to take the form o f increased income support to the needy; 
Improving the investment climate by streamlining business regulations, including shifting from 
ex ante approval to ex post verification o f license requirements fo r starting a business; and 
Reforming the labor market by rationalizing the wage setting mechanism and easing restrictions 
on work and residency permits.

cooperation with the EU, AFD and other donors, w i l l support the government’s goal to

63. W i t h a v i ew to achieving sustainable economic development and full pa r t ic ipa t ion 
in the new international economy, Mauritius has been proactive in p r om o t i n g i t s in te res ts 
at various bilateral, reg iona l and mu l t i la te ra l levels. I t also has championed a number o f 
initiatives to support the cause o f developing states, inc lud ing Sma l l Is land Deve lop ing

supporting the regional agenda by p rov id ing funds at the reg iona l l e v e l t o promote 
economic integration, inc lud ing the sustainable management o f na tu ra l resources. The EU 
further intends to s ign Econom ic Partnership agreements with b o t h the Eastern and 
Southern A f r i c a and Southern A f r i c a Development Commun i ty (SADC ) regions by 2008. 

64. 
The Government o f Mau r i t ius i s pa r t icu la r ly interested in pa r t ic ipa t ing in regional 
initiatives. I t w o u l d like to be l i n k e d to the East A f r i c a Submarine System (EASSy) fiber

Guidelines f o r Bank Involvement 

6 6 . 

The f lex ib le nature o f the CPS crea tes a need fo r guidelines as to when and where 
the Bank should be engaged in Mau r i t ius . Based on Mau r i t ius ’ f inanc ia l circumstances and 
i t s defensible development agenda, the first basis fo r any engagement mus t be demand b y 
Mauritius, w h i c h w i l l also ensure that activities undertaken are a coun t ry p r i o r i t y . 
However, o n i t s side, the Bank must ensu re that i t s w o r k in Mau r i t ius se rves the 
institution’s broader goals and m e e t s ins t i tu t iona l standards. Fo r this purpose, management 
w i l l regularly mon i to r b o t h reforms and the environment in to which B a n k resources are 
placed. 

6 7 . 

The Bank w i l l ensure that the environment in to w h i c h B a n k resources are p laced i s 
adequate in terms o f p o l i c y d i rec t ion and governance. This w i l l requ i re regular mon i to r ing 
o f Mau r i t ius ’ ove ra l l r e f o rm efforts, pa r t icu la r ly progress in areas such as macroeconomic 
and fiscal management, and the various aspects that cou ld contribute t o greater 
competitiveness, as evidenced by actions in these areas as ou t l ined above. Outcomes in the 
four pillars o f the Government re fo rm program w i l l be mon i to red th rough the CPS results 
ma t r ix and the D P L as ou t l ined be low . 

6 8 . 

Under the unlikely scenario o f a ma jo r departure f r om sound macroeconomic 
policies, the B a n k w o u l d respond by reducing lend ing volumes, and D P L s w i l l no t be 
available in a context where the macroeconomic f ramewo rk i s unsatisfactory, inc lud ing , 
for example, were public debt to r i s e to a leve l approaching 80 percent o f GDP . A n y 
significant changes in the proposed strategy wou ld be reflected in the CPS Progress 
Report. 

Monitoring and Evaluation 

6 9 . 

The r e s u l t s m a t r i x presented in this CPS i s a j o i n t E U -W o r l d Bank mon i to r ing tool. 
I t includes outcome indicators fo r b o t h EU and W o r l d Bank programs. Because the CPS 
sets out a f lex ib le , broad program, the e lemen ts o f which w i l l be determined every year 
through Annua l Bus iness Plans, the CPS resu l ts framework includes a b road l i s t o f 
potential outcomes. I t i s no t expected that the Bank w i l l contribute t o a l l o f these 
outcomes, bu t o n l y t o those in w h i c h i t w i l l be invo lved . In addition, g iven that this i s a 
j o i n t E U -W o r l d B a n k ma t r ix , i t includes outcomes in areas o f EU invo lvemen t that may 
not be part o f the Bank program. I t also i s important t o note that the B a n k may contribute 
to outcomes that are no t reflected in the r e s u l t s ma t r ix , i f any are added to the program as a 
result o f the annual business p lann ing exercise. Therefore the r e s u l t s m a t r i x w i l l be further 
refined as the p rog ram i s developed as part o f the Annua l Bus iness P lann ing exercise. 

7 0 . 

In add i t ion t o the r e s u l t s ma t r ix , the CPS p rog ram w i l l be mon i to red and evaluated 
through tw o instruments, which have been harmonized w i t h other donors and the 
Government. F i r s t , the annual business plan discussions w i l l be used t o evaluate the 
r e s u l t s o f the Bank ’s p rog ram and assess whether i t i s mee t ing i ts b road development 
objectives under the fou r CPS p i l la rs . The Annua l B u s i n e s s Plans also w i l l p rov ide an 
opportunity to update and fine-tune the results f ramewo rk in l i n e with the agreed assistance 
program fo r each pa r t icu la r year. This exercise w i l l be carried out j o i n t l y with the EU. 
The changes w i l l be re f lec ted in the updated r e s u l t s ma t r ix as part o f the regular CPS 
progress reports (once in 2-3 years). This approach to mon i to r ing and evaluation differs 
f rom the t rad i t iona l approach o f a pre-determined p rog ram with pre-defined objectives. I t

Risks to the Bank program. There i s a risk that the Gove rnmen t may n o t bo r row 
f rom the Bank as happened during the imp lemen ta t ion o f the p rev ious Coun t ry Assistance 
Strategy. During the preparation o f this CPS, the Government has repeatedly indicated 
that i t intends to b o r r ow f r om the Bank over the medium term as i t needs : (i) f inanc ing fo r 
i t s new re fo rm program; and (ii) the Bank’s technical expertise and w o r l dw i d e experience 
to help see the coun t ry th rough the challenging time ahead and m i n im i z e the social impact 
o f transition. To address this risk, rather than pre-determining the w o r k p rog ram over the 
next several years, the B a n k and Government have agreed to p l a n and review their w o r k 
program o n an annual basis so that necessary adjustments can be made. There i s also a 
risk that the Bank m a y n o t be able to meet the expectations o f the client, especially as far 
as the analytical and adv iso ry w o r k i s concerned. The Bank’s operational budget fo r 
Mau r i t ius i s re la t ive ly sma l l and inadequate t o meet the c l ien t ’s expectations. Given the 
uncertainty concerning h o w m u c h the government w i l l b o r r ow f o r e i the r p o l i c y o r 
investment loans du r ing the CPS period, the operational budget m a y b e even smaller in the 
future. The strategy t r i e s to address this risk th rough the creation o f a proposed j o i n t 
donor-government AAA fund that can finance e f fo r ts to meet the Government’s analytical 
and technical assistance needs. 

Creditworthiness 

77. 
Mau r i t ius ’ fo re ign currency i s s u e r ratings are Baa2/P-2, and the r a t i n g f o r the 
government’s rupee-denominated debt i s A 2 . These ratings re f lec t the country’s modest 
external debt burden and i t s economic dynam ism within a stable p o l i t i c a l f ramewo rk . 
However, in December 2005, Moody ’s Investors Service lowe red the ou t look o n Mau r i t ius ’ 
debt ratings to negative f r om stable, “. . .in l i g h t o f the un favo rab le d i rec t ion o f government 
finances over recent years, i n c l u d i n g high l e v e l s o f government debt.”13 M a u r i t i u s debt 
stands currently at around 70 percent o f GDP, but most o f this i s b o r r ow e d in te rna l ly and 
poses l i t t l e exchange risk, especially with fo re ign reserves at a com fo r tab le l e v e l equal to 
around eight months o f imports, however the decline in EPZ expo r t earnings and the 
higher impo r t b i l l are p lac ing increasing pressure o n external liquidity. The s i tua t ion i s no t 
imm inen t ly unsustainable, but the coun t ry i s vulnerable to macroeconomic r i s k s arising 
f r om slower growth, fu r the r adverse movements in the terms o f trade and rising interest 
rates. Government bas recognized the need fo r strong f isca l conso l ida t ion w h i c h was 
announced in the 2006-2007 Budget Speech. The credit risks t o the B a n k are l o w but 
increasing. 

V I . CONCLUDING REMARKS 

78. 
This CPS i s designed to ensu re strong Government owne rsh ip o f the Bank ’s 
program, to a l l ow the Gove rnmen t and the Bank t o adjust that p r o g r am to changing 
Government p r io r i t ies and coun t ry circumstances, and thereby t o m a x im i z e the Bank’s 
con t r ibu t ion to M a u r i t i u s ’ development. As i s the case o f any new relationship, the strategy 
w i l l challenge b o t h the Bank and the Government, but i f i t i s successful, i t w i l l create a real 
partnership in service t o the people o f Mau r i t ius .

Recently, a sense o f urgency has been added because o f the phase-out o f trade 
preferences fo r sugar and t e x t i l e s apparel (which together account f o r 80 percent o f 
Mauritius' merchandise exports). In January 2005, M F A tex t i le quotas ended. A 36 percent 
decrease in sugar prices under the EU sugar p ro toco l beginning in 2007 w i l l cost Mau r i t ius 
around € 1 00 m i l l i o n per year. An t ic ipa t ion o f these developments has depressed p r iva te 
investment over the past several years, leading t o a s lowdown in g row th . Up to 40,000 jobs 
already have been los t in sugar and apparel, and the eventual to ta l i s likely t o reach 50,000 
o r more - or 10 pe rcen t o f the wo rk force. Meanwhile, the new h ighe r value-added, 
knowledge based economy has been s low to take o f f . P roduc t iv i ty g r ow t h has stagnated 
and unemployment has r i s e n to near 10 percent. 

4. 
Slower g row th and ma jo r public in i t ia t ives o n education and infrastructure have 
taken their t o l l on the public finances. Government deficits rose sharply beg inn ing in 2001 , 
and have remained h i g h in contrast to the government's medium-term f isca l strategy, which 
called f o r them to dec l ine t o 3 percent by FY 2004/05. Pub l ic sector debt stands at nearly 70 
percent' o f GDP. The current situation and near term prospects pose n o urgent threat to 
solvency, bu t increasingly there i s a need fo r modest corrective ac t ion t o reduce 
vu lne rab i l i ty t o external risks (terms o f trade, weather and w o r l d i n t e r e s t rate shocks) and 
internal ones (lower growth). No tab ly , Moody 's recently downgraded i t s ou t look o n 
Mauritius f r om s tab le to negative. 

5 . 

Economic performance has been respectable, i f be low long - te rm trends. A l o n g w i t h the 
structural challenges that Mau r i t ius has been facing, weather poses a constant threat and output 
was depressed b y Cyclone Dina in 2002, especially in the ag r icu l tu ra l sector. Nevertheless, 
g row th has remained pos i t ive . In FY04/05, GDP g row th at factor costs was 4.0 percent, as 
disappointing r e s u l t s in agriculture and a 9.5 percent contraction in the E P Z sector were offset 
b y strong g row th in tourism, fueled by a 5.9 percent increase in a r r iva ls t o 761,063. A 
resoundingly pessimistic ou t look - over 80 pe rcen t o f respondents p o l l e d about their 
expectations reported they were somewhat or very pessimistic about the economy at year-end 
2005 - has depressed investment and contributed t o weak p r iva te demand. But a l l things 
considered, this i s no t a bad performance.

The FY02 CAS Framework and Objectives 

6. 

The 2002 CAS underwent a broad consultation process with government, c i v i l 
society, labo r unions, vulnerable groups, and donors. The consultations p rov ided inpu t to 
the Strategy on the challenges facing the country. F o r example, one focus group was made 
up o f unemp loyed men and women in their 40s and 50s . The m a j o r i t y in this group were 
women d ivo rced o r abandoned b y their husbands w h o h a d been p rev ious ly employed at 
closed textiles factories, l e t go w i t h few o r no benefits and generally w i t h o u t other s k i l l s . 
Another group consisted o f labor unions t o discuss in particular, the proposed reforms in 
education. These i s s u e s surrounding the challenges o f ma in ta in ing M a u r i t i u s ’ 
competitiveness and o f the top p r i o r i t y o f education featured h e a v i l y in the Strategy. 

7 . 

The 2002 C A S sought to cover a w ide ground with limited resources. I t s e t out to 
support the Government’s ambitious r e f o rm program, the New Econom ic Agenda (NEA), 
the goals o f w h i c h were t o ma in ta in the country’s g r ow t h performance and imp rove the 
welfare o f i t s citizens. The NEA’s key components inc lude : (i) imp rovemen t in 
competitiveness o f M a u r i t i u s ’ p r iva te sector; (ii) investments in people; (iii) preserving and 
protecting Mau r i t ius ’ f rag i le environment; and ( iv ) imp rovemen t in economic management. 

8 . 

The Bank’s C A S h igh l igh ted the expansion o f education and imp rovemen t in 
quality as the mos t impo r tan t requirements fo r the success o f the NEA, and also p inpo in ted 
other development areas that deserved greater focus, i n c l u d i n g social programs, 
environmental i s s u e s , mass transit, and pub l ic resource management. 

9 . 

M o r e specific med ium - te rm outcomes w h i c h the B a n k se t ou t t o support during the

Over the C A S period, the Bank has been actively i n v o l v e d in the successful re fo rm 
and transformation o f the f inanc ia l sector in Mau r i t ius and the qua l i ty o f the Bank ’s input 
has been h i g h l y appreciated b y the authorities. A t the beg inn ing o f the C A S period, the 
Financial S tab i l i ty F o r um categorized the country’s offshore f inanc ia l center as a poo r ly 
regulated ju r isd ic t ion . The strengthening o f the regulatory and supervisory framework, and 
the complete overhaul o f f inanc ia l sector leg is la t ion resulted in a n im p r o v e d f inanc ia l 
reputation recognized by the international commun i ty and an im p r o v e d f ramewo rk fo r 
accounting, aud i t ing and corporate governance. In particular, the Bank ’s t w o projects in the 
financial sector, the F inanc ia l Sector Infrastructure Project ($4.75 m i l l i o n ) and the F inanc ia l 
Sector Supervisory A u t h o r i t y Project ($1 .8 1 m i l l i o n ) helped M a u r i t i u s establish a mode rn 
payments system and s e t up the F inanc ia l Services Comm iss ion as the regulator fo r the 
non-bank f inanc ia l services sector. As f o l l ow up to the FSAP, the B a n k w o r k e d with 
FIRST In i t ia t ive to p rov ide technical assistance to establish a code o f corporate governance, 
implement anti-money launde r ing measures, d ra f t a new Securities A c t and establish a 
Financial Repo r t ing Counc i l . The instruments the Bank used in this sector were Econom ic 
and Sector W o r k (ESW), p o l i c y advice, technical assistance, and IBRD investment loans. 
ESW included a comprehensive f inanc ia l Sector assessment (FSAP) in 2002-03, pension 
reform work, and assessments o n Corporate Governance, Accoun t ing and Aud i t ing , and 
Corporate Inso lvency .

Investing in people and society: Education and t ra in ing , poverty alleviation and pensions 

18 . 
D u r i n g the C A S period, the Government o f Mau r i t ius fully met i t s objective o f 
launching i ts landmark education reform. P r io r to the P ER L preparation, the government 
had already extended mandatory education f r om six to 11 years o f schooling. Subsequently, 
the government made good progress, as fo l lows : (i) a new exam system, w h i c h has 
effectively e l im ina ted national rank ing fo r entrance in to secondary schools in favor o f a 
regional structure, was introduced in December 2002; (ii) the secondary education system 
was decentralized; (iii) b o t h the p r ima ry and secondary school cu r r icu la have been largely 
revised; and ( iv ) a p rog ram has been formulated to address the problems o f low -pe r fo rm ing 
schools (Zones Education Prioritaires ZEPs), w h i c h i s be ing implemented in 27 schools 
mostly located in dep r ived regions and reaching 1 1,000 pupils. The enrollment rate o f the 
12-16 age group i s at around 80 percent in 2004, up f r om 76 percent in 2001. Access also 
has increased th rough the creation o f new secondary schools, f r om 34 in 2000 to 70 in 
2005. Desp i te the widespread reforms, however, the downwa rd trend o f Certificate o f 
Primary Educa t ion (CPE) pass rates has no t yet been reversed (63 pe rcen t in 2004 f r om 66 
percent in 2000), a l though the secondary and h ighe r secondary pass rates have imp roved 
from 76 pe rcen t in 2001 t o 77.5 percent in 2004 and f r om 72 percent in 2001 t o 76.2 
percent in 2004, respectively. A t the tertiary level, the to ta l number o f students has, 
inc reased f r om 16,759 in 2000/2001 to 25,715 in 2004/2005. 

19. 
The Bank’s value added in this re fo rm has been in: (i) mee t ing the urgent and 
c r i t i c a l need t o cost the e n t i r e education reform; (ii) o f fe r ing advice o n cu r r icu la 
development, and (iii) p rov id ing assistance in developing the M a u r i t i u s Qualifications 
Au tho r i ty as a regulatory agency fo r vocational training. The Bank’s Educa t ion and 
T ra in ing Sector N o t e b r ings together po l icy , ins t i tu t iona l management and re fo rm 
management i s s u e s , and provides lessons f r om Mau r i t ius ’ As ian competitors in the 
education sector. Once Bank support through the preparation o f the second PER L ended 
and the Educa t ion and T ra in ing Sector N o t e was finalized, the B a n k has v i r tua l ly stopped 
i t s sector support to education in Mau r i t ius , as n o lend ing o r AAA was requested, although 
the Bank has p rov ided p o l i c y advice through the recent C E M o n growth. Today, the new 
Government’s r e f o rm p rog ram includes reversing some o f the p o l i c y decisions taken by the 
previous Government, no tab ly b y reun i t ing the F o rm I -V and F o rm V I colleges, wh ich has 
become the sub jec t o f a ma jo r nationwide debate.

levels. Prior to the P E R L preparation, the government had enacted the Wastewater 
Management A u t h o r i t y ( W M A ) Act and published the revised wastewater ta r i f fs fo r 2002. 
Since then, the amendment t o the WMA A c t to p rov ide fo r compulsory house connections 
(both domestic and n o n domestic) was approved b y Government and enacted in August 
2004. The W M A has been established as a f inanc ia l ly sustainable, autonomous corporate 
body, and the progression and structure o f t a r i f f s are in place at agreed sector p o l i c y levels. 
A j o i n t b i l l i n g system was introduced in January 2004. The W M A has registered an 
improvement in the co l lec t ion performance o f the wastewater bills, with the rate o f t a r i f f 
collection averaging 8 5 percent du r ing 2003-2004, and 82 percent du r ing 2004-2005. As o f 
January 2005, 56,153 houses have been connected t o the W M A , and an add i t iona l 1,300 
houses have been connected and are be ing processed fo r b i l l i n g ne two rk . In sewerage, the 
Government also met i t s objective o f completing a l l sector and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms 
according to the agreed sector p o l i c y letter. This i s n o w be ing rev ised f o r the pe r iod 2005- 
20 10. F ina l ly , standards fo r indus t r ia l discharge have been implemented in compliance 
with environmental standards. No tw i ths tand ing t h e s e achievements, progress in the sector 
i s somewhat behind i n i t i a l plans due to poor management at the agency. 

2 1. 
The value added o f the Bank in the environment sector has been in: (i) supporting 
the development o f Na t iona l Env i ronmen ta l A c t i o n Plans (NEAPS); (ii) p r o v i d i n g advice 
on the financial sustainability o f the sewerage sector, which resulted in water and sanitation 
reforms and investment p rog ram and an in t roduc t ion o f a j o i n t b i l l i n g system f o r clean 
water and sewerage; (iii) a id ing the ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm o f the WMA; (iv) assisting in the 
implementation o f the household connection system; and (v) supporting b iod ive rs i ty 
conservation th rough GEF. With Bank support a na t iona l S o l i d Waste Master P lan and 
Strategy was pu t in place. The Bank introduced the Prototype Carbon Fund f o r the 
reduction o f emissions, and supported pa r t ic ipa t ion o f the p r iva te sector in developing so l id 
aste management systems. Achievements in the Environment, Sewerage, S o l i d Waste and 
Water Sectors are examples o f successful processes and partnerships between the 
Government and donors, w h i c h f i r s t developed sector strategies and p r io r i t ies , and then 
addressed p r i o r i t y areas th rough projects, with the donor commun i ty w o r k i n g together 
according to comparative advantage. Specifically, wh i le the Bank helped the Government 
develop the NEAPs , the A f r i c a n Development Bank helped Mau r i t ius develop a Na t iona l 
Sewerage Master Plan, w h i c h different donors supported th rough projects and regu la r ly 
held j o i n t Government donor meetings o n sewerage. 

22. 
The transport sector underwent a s im i la r process where the Bank supported a 
Na t iona l Strategy, fo l lowed b y ESW, w h i c h i s n o w leading t o lending, with a view to 
partnering with the p r iva te sector and donors. The Bank developed a Transport A c t i o n P lan 
in 2003, which included a f inanc ia l t o o l fo r government t o determine the phasing and 
sequencing o f a l l investments in the transport sector. Th rough i t s longstanding dialogue on 
transport throughout the CAS period, the Bank assisted in ma jo r road ne two rk upgrading, 
and i s currently f inanc ing a Project Preparation Fac i l i ty to examine different options fo r 
reducing t ra f f ic congestion in Po r t Lou is . In the wake o f the successful imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the Port Development and Env i ronmen t Protection Project, the Bank also continued to 
provide technical assistance in po r t and ma r i t ime transport, t o help the Au tho r i t ies cope 
w i t h higher-than-anticipated g row th in po r t transshipment t ra f f ic , w h i c h enhanced Port

Economic Management 

23 . 

The emergence o f sustained budget d e f i c i t s since 2000 indicates unde r ly ing 
problems w i t h f isca l management. L e s s evident bu t also a p rob lem i s a failure t o a l ign 
budget resources with na t iona l p r io r i t ies . To address these issues, the Bank supported the 
introduction o f a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). S ign i f ican t progress has 
been achieved, w i t h the establishment, staffing and t ra in ing o f a central M T E F unit in the 
M in is t ry o f Finance and Economic Development; development o f a th ree -yea r framework 
o f revenues and spending w h i c h i s published as an annex in the Budge t Estimates; and 
preparation o f s ix p i l o t MTEFs incorporating results-based formats. M o r e recently, in 
response to some loss o f momentum, the Bank reviewed the imp lemen ta t ion strategy, and 
recommended some changes to increase awareness and ownership o f b o t h M T E F and the 
Government’s f isca l f ramewo rk . A fully operational MTEF i s well within Mau r i t ius ’ grasp, 
and the recent Coun t ry Econom ic Memorandum has ou t l ined s teps t o rev i ta l ize the 
implementation process. 

24 . 

The stock o f know ledge has improved, and the Bank has contributed to po l icy 
reform, pa r t icu la r ly in t h e areas o f public-sector management, education and development 
o f the private sector, inc lud ing the investment c l ima te and labo r market. The Bank’s ESW 
o n Pension R e f o rm contributed to national dialogue, w h i c h led t o the in t roduc t ion o f means 
testing on the basic pension. This measure, however, was controversial, and has been 
reversed b y the current Government. E SW o n the labor market and unemployment led the 
Central Statistics O f f i c e to revise i t s procedures fo r comp i l ing data o n labor. 

Measuring Bank Performance 

25 . 

Overall, the Bank did well du r ing the CAS pe r iod in b o t h substance and quality, 
wh ich led to r e s u l t s . I t also aligned i t s e l f to Government objectives, and showed f l e x i b i l i t y 
in diverging f r om the p rog ram to respond to Government requests. Howeve r , the CAS did 
not evaluate risks properly, as i t did no t foresee the risk that the coun t ry w o u l d no t borrow, 
and i t pu t a l l i ts eggs in one basket b y centering the whole p rog ram o n the PERLs and 
underpinning AAA. Because the Bank’s lend ing program was t o be implemented through 
budget support, the C A S mon i to r ing ma t r ix was broad and too ambitious t o track the 
Bank’s r e s u l t s as d is t inc t f r om the Government’s o w n objectives and outcomes. Finally, 
the l a c k o f a loca l p resence hindered Bank effectiveness. 

26. 

The Bank’s lend ing and n o n lend ing program described in the last C A S aimed at 
supporting the New Econom ic Agenda, through a s e r i e s o f umb re l la Pub l ic Expenditure 
Re fo rm Loans (PERLs) and AAA . These adjustment operations were to be supported b y a 
heavy program o f ES W, designed and agreed upon w i t h the Government and selected 
donors. Wh i le the p r inc ip les unde r ly ing the last CAS, in terms o f a l ign ing t o the 
Government p rog ram and p r o v i d i n g international expertise and advice rema in valid, the 
actual wo rk p rog ram d ive rged f r om what was envisaged. The f i r s t P E R L was approved in 
2002, but the tw o subsequent PERLs to ta l ing U S $ S O m i l l i o n did n o t materialize. As on ly 

Annex 2 

Page 11 o f 16 

one PERL transpired, the impac t o f Bank assistance and the qua l i ty o f ove ra l l p o l i c y r e f o rm 
mon i to r ing and in f luence was l e s s than envisaged in the CAS . Th rough the ongoing 
po r t fo l io and a strong AAA p rog ram o f technical assistance and ES W, however, the Bank 
continued t o p rov ide p o l i c y advice and keep in fo rmed o f sector developments. 

27. 

A shortcoming o f the 2002 CAS was in iden t i fy ing the risk that the country wou ld 
not borrow, and the divergence f r om the planned AAA . As the tasks undertaken changed 
from the planned C A S to accommodate new Government p r io r i t ies , the B a n k considered 
preparing a progress report to revise the program. Since the C A S timeframe was on ly two 
years, however, the decision was taken t o prepare a new CAS instead, and t o focus the new 
Strategy o n emerging good practices f r om other Middle Income Countries. This 
undertaking was started but delayed upon the reques t o f the Government due to elections. 
In hindsight, despite the problems that occurred f r om the dev ia t ion f r om the planned 
program, this wo rked out well, as the Government changed, and with the new Government 
came completely new ideas f o r Bank support. 

Quality o f S e r v i c e s

Lending Services. The Bank’s decision to phase out multiple investment operations 
and focus on single tranche PERLs r e f l e c t e d b o t h i t s in ten t ion t o support Mau r i t ius ’ 
ambitious re fo rm p rog ram and i t s l im i t e d resources fo r ac t iv i t ies in Mau r i t ius . PERLs were 
planned t o be timed t o coincide with Mau r i t ius ’ budgetary cyc le so that proceeds o f W o r l d 
Bank loans w o u l d be available at the beginning o f Mauritius’ f isca l year. 

2 9 . 

In terms o f objectives, the f i rs t PER L aimed to assist the government set the 
foundation fo r attaining i t s med ium - te rm outcomes. The I C R f o r the first PER L rated Bank 
and Bo r rowe r performance as satisfactory. The B a n k was considered t o have supported 
Mau r i t ius adequately th rough the core advisory services that were rendered under 
supervision, and in he lp ing track the overall Government program. The second PER L 
wou ld have been aimed at he lp ing the Government imp lemen t i ts landmark education 
re fo rm . The preparation process f o r the second P ER L had a useful impac t s i n c e i t led the 
Bank t o p rov ide close technical assistance and advice as the government undertook i t s 
education re fo rm . Results f r om this wo rk and the education support p rov ided through the 
AAA a re documented in the previous section. Once the second P ER L was dropped and the 
ESW finalized, the Bank stopped actively supporting the government o n education re fo rm . 
Country elections took place thereafter, and some o f the p o l i c y decisions under the previous 
Government have since been reversed. 

30. 

The Bank has r e c e i v e d some m i x e d feedback as t o the unde r ly ing reasons fo r the 
discontinuation o f bo r row ing . O n the one hand, the Government indicated that i t did no t 
need further b o r r ow i n g f r om the Bank fo r budget support. Ano the r reason g iven was that 
the transaction costs, such as the Bank’s conditions and triggers t o move f r om the first to 
second PERL , f o r Bank f inanc ing were found to be re la t ive ly h i g h fo r what Government 
was getting in return. The bo r row ing was actually l i k e l y spurred by continued demand fo r 
Bank services, and access t o international expertise and advice rather than actual f inanc ia l 

need.

Analytical and Advisory Assistance Services: O n the ana ly t ica l and advisory 
services side, a Coun t ry Procurement Assessment Report, a Pub l ic Expend i tu re Rev iew to 
assess financing f o r the NEA, a Transport A c t i o n Plan, and a C E M were undertaken. A 
Financial Sector Assessment P lan (FSAP) also was completed in FY 0 3 . Some o f the AAA 
tasks indicated in the CAS, f o r example, Welfare Reform, Hea l th Sector re fo rm , Gender 
Assessment and ES W o n the I n f o rm a l Economy and Taxation, were no t undertaken. O n 
the other hand, several AAA activities no t inc luded in the CAS were ca r r ied out upon the 
request o f the Government; these included i n ES W o n Occupational Pension Funds, 
Insurance Industry, A n t i -M o n e y Launde r ing iCFT Assessment, Real-time Gross Settlement, 
Membership in S A C U and Corporate Governance. A i d fo r Trade TA and repo r t has 
recently p rov ided an impo r tan t unde rp inn ing fo r the new Government r e f o rm program. 
Also, as part o f non - lend ing se rv ices , the Bank established an IDF grant (US$494,000) to 
help with capacity b u i l d i n g f o r imp lemen ta t ion o f the MTEF. 

32. 
For several p ieces o f ESW, the Bank reacted q u i c k l y and e f f i c i e n t l y t o meet jus t - in - 
time knowledge needs o f the Government. The Strategic Relevance and In te rna l Qua l i ty of 
Bank AAA were rated h i g h l y . M o s t importantly, the c l ien t has greatly appreciated the 
Bank’s technical and analytical w o r k and continues to seek mo re than the B a n k can p rov ide 
w i t h i n i t s limited resource envelope. An internal Bank assessment by the Qua l i ty Assurance 
Group (QAG ) revealed areas f o r improvement in the AAA program, w h i c h the Bank has 
already begun to take in to account. I t p roved t o be too ambitious t o p re -p rog ram a three- 
year AAA program, as several activities were no t undertaken and replaced by others. 
Financing an ambitious AAA p rog ram also p roved to be d i f f i c u l t once the Government 
stopped bo r row ing f r om the Bank . 

3 3 . 

Q A G found that the B a n k should have moved more aggressively n o t on ly in the 
development o f h i g h qua l i ty ana ly t ica l work, but in i ts dissemination and f o l l o w up. The 
leve l o f dissemination and f o l l o w up were in part due t o l im i t e d resources f o r the Mau r i t ius 
program in the absence o f bo r row ing , and in some cases dissemination was kep t at a l o w 
leve l due to the preference o f the Government. Some counterexamples include AAA 
i n v o l v i n g pensions, FSAP and the Corporate Governance ROSC; these AAA p rov ide good 
examples o f where resu l ts were presented a t well-attended national workshops and 
conferences. For bo th the FSAP and Corporate Governance ROSC, grant fund ing was 
obtained f r om F IRST In i t ia t ive (a mu l t i -dono r agency that i s pa r t ia l ly funded by’the Bank 
and provides grants fo r financial-sector wo rk ) to help the Mau r i t ians implement some o f the 
recommendations. 

34. 
In the absence o f a regular lend ing program, the ma jo r constraint in the Bank / 
Mau r i t ius partnership i s the limited human and financial resources allocated t o the 
Mau r i t ius program, as h igh l igh ted in the QAG ’s AAA assessment. This, together with the 
absence o f structured j o i n t w o r k p lann ing sessions, hampered the effectiveness o f Bank 
support and Bank responsiveness to new needs of the Government.

Mix of 

instruments. E v e n though bo r row ing was l e s s than expected, the re was 
generally an appropriate mix o f instruments. Q A G has suggested a greater u s e o f technical 
assistance; and programmatic ESW i s be ing integrated in to the new Coun t ry Partnership 
Strategy.

Conclusion 

3 8 . W h i l e Mau r i t ius clearly has a l l the necessary ingredients fo r successful programs 
that have led to good outcomes f r om Bank support, the p rob lems in the Mau r i t ius -Bank 
partnership l i e no t in the tasks themselves, which are carried ou t successfully, b r ing ing to 
bear the Bank’s g loba l know ledge and resources , but rather in the process o f identifying, 
prioritizing, and fund ing tasks. The t rad i t iona l pre-determined three-year C A S i s no t well 
suited fo r the M a u r i t i a n context. Rather, a more regular dialogue o n the country program i s 

needed. 

111. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS 

3 9 . 

Recommendation 1: Continue to align the Bank’s p rog ram to the Government’s. 

A l ign ing the Bank’s p rog ram t o the Government wo rked well, a n d B a n k input was 
consistently h i g h l y rated in achieving strategic relevance. 

40. 

Recommendation 2: The Bank should use a more f lex ib le approach in its work 
with Mau r i t ius through a jo in t Annua l Business P lann ing process with Government. 

The Bank’s w o r k p rog ram over the CAS pe r iod diverged f r om what was planned. Wh i le 
this showed responsiveness o n the side o f the Bank, some d i f f icu l t ies emerged with staffing 
and financing tasks outside o f no rma l business planning. To avo id this problem, the Bank 
and the Government should agree upon a l i s t o f p r io r i t ized ac t iv i t ies f o r w h i c h the 
Government w o u l d l i k e the Bank’s support. A j o i n t l y agreed, strategic approach that 
involves pa r t ic ipa t ion f r om l i n e ministries prepared on an annual basis w o u l d increase 
c la r i ty on b o t h s ides about Bank support t o Mau r i t ius . A complementary approach wou ld 
be to define just one o r tw o flagship areas fo r in-depth assistance and to limit just-in-time 
advice to a few products on ly . While the 2002 CAS made best u s e o f available instruments 
at the time, this new approach r e f l e c t s emerging good practices in other M idd le - Income 
Countries. 

Recommendation 3: The output matrix should be realistic and linked to areas 

41. 
where the Bank can have an impact. The last CAS p o l i c y focused o n higher order goals o f 

the Government’s r e f o rm program, to w h i c h Bank assistance was a l igned but over w h i c h 
the Bank’s interventions w o u l d have o n l y an ind i rec t in f luence . The C A S m a t r i x therefore 
was ove r ly ambitious. 

Annex 2 
Page 14 o f 16 

42. 

Recommendation 4: A l low flexibility fo r adjustment o r investment lending by 
diversifying the portfolio, and have a fall-back position if no lending occurs. The 2002 

CAS planned to carry ou t umb re l la adjustment operations rather than multiple investment 
operations due t o b o t h substantive and budgetary reasons. The B a n k shou ld no t put a l l i t s 
eggs in one basket. Given that the Government chose n o t t o continue bo r row ing , this 
approach was n o t meeting the needs o f the Government at the time. 

43. 

Recommendation 5: Leverage additional resources fo r AAA work over and above 

the Bank’s budget. Given that f inanc ing an ambitious AAA p rog ram p roved t o be d i f f i c u l t 
once the Government stopped bo r row ing f r om the Bank, i t w i l l be impo r tan t t o leverage 
Bank f inanc ing o f AAA, fo r example, th rough a cost sharing arrangement w i t h the 
Government. Ano the r poss ib i l i ty w o u l d be f o r the Government t o u s e i t s o w n resources fo r 
p ro jec t preparation in cases o f lending, w h i c h w o u l d f r e e up bank budget f o r AAA. 

44. 

Recommendation 6: Answer the “how” rather than the “why” i n AAA. While the 

qua l i ty o f Bank w o r k i s appreciated, i t i s impo r tan t fo r this sophisticated c l ien t to focus 
more o n h o w to imp lemen t re fo rms than the unde r ly ing analysis. 

45. 

Recommendation 7: Give greater emphasis to dissemination offindings of 
analytical work and collaboration with other donors. Emphasis should continue to be put 

o n dissemination o f f ind ings o f analytical w o r k and co l labo ra t ion with other donors. Given 
i ts lack o f loca l presence, the Bank cou ld cooperate mo re with other donors in know ledge 
dissemination and sharing. Coo rd ina t ion with other donors was good in specific sectors, 
but, in l i n e with the weaknesses in j o i n t p rog ramm ing w i t h the Government, has been l e s s 
effective at a strategic l e v e l . The Bank also should leverage i t s assistance mo re against 
Government resources and those o f other donors. 

46. 

Recommendation 8: Leverage the’limited I B R D p rog ram through greater 
involvement of 
the other arms of the Bank Group, IFC, M I G A , GEF and W B I , fo r 

example, in p r iva te sector development and the f inanc ia l sector, and in pos i t ion ing 
Mau r i t ius as a g loba l know ledge hub. 

47. 

Recommendation 9: Establish a one-person liaison office i n Po r t Louis to 

enhance dissemination and f o l l ow - u p o f ana ly t ica l w o r k as well as outreach efforts.

Page 2 o f 4 

In t roduc t ion . This Annex p rov ides additional in fo rma t ion o n t h e coun t ry financing 
parameters for Mauritius established pursuant t o OP/BP 6.00, Bank F inanc ing . The 
Government has been consulted o n the country f inanc ing parameters, and has ind ica ted that i t 
welcomes the increased f l e x i b i l i t y in the W o r l d Bank ’s approach t o f inanc ing o f investment 
projects, and believes that this should facilitate implementation and achievement o f results’. 

Pub l ic Fincrncinl Mcrnagement. Overall, the Mau r i t ius P F M system i s satisfactory. The 
budget adequately r e f l e c t s p o l i c y p r io r i t ies b y the Government. An MTEF together with a 
results-based management f ramewo rk was introduced in 2003 and MTEFs were prepared f o r 
6 sec tor ministries in the last budget. The M T E F w i l l require further deepening and the 
government i s comm i t ted to this. Budget preparation i s undertaken in close consultation w i t h 
the spending ministries, but while mu l t i -yea r projections exist f o r mos t parts o f the 
administration, the p r io r i t iza t ion o f public expenditure has made l i t t l e progress. The budget 
classification system i s comprehensive and in l i n e with in te rna t iona l standards. N o 
significant funds are con t ro l led outside the budget, although large losses in the parastatal 
sector, largely stemming f r om subsidized o i l imports, are o f f balance shee t . Financial 
management and con t ro l system are comprehensive and effective; the M a u r i t i u s IFMIS i s 
considered a “model” case and covers a l l relevant stages o f the budget preparation and 
execution process. There i s no significant deviation between p lanned and actual budget. 
Payment arrears do no t exist. Reconc i l ia t ion between fiscal and central Bank accounts i s 
made regularly and comprehensively (at least weekly). The Accoun tan t General produces 
(h igh quality) budget execution reports o n a regularly (monthly) basis w h i c h f o rm the basis 
for discussions at the Cabinet l e v e l . Pub l ic accounts are prepared within a m o n t h after the 
fiscal year ends. The Government Audit O f f ice (external independent auditor repo r t ing to 
Parliament) reports w i t h i n a few months. Recommendations o f the Audit O f f ice are 
discussed w i t h adequate actions taken b y the Government. 

Cost Sharing. Government ownership o f projects i s strong. The p o l i t i c a l leadership has 
shown a firm commitment to i t s v is ion and re fo rm program, which i s entirely homegrown. 
As noted, the CPS i s based o n the fou r p i l la rs o f the Government’s strategy, and the Bank 
Group’s program w i l l be se t ou t each year in an Annual Bus iness P lan (ABP), which w i l l be 
developed in pa ra l le l w i t h the Government’s annual p lann ing and budget processes to ensure 
that the Bank i s f u l l y in step with Mau r i t ius ’ development agenda, and with other donors’ 
support. The Government’s new r e f o rm p rog ram i s currently estimated t o cost as much as Rs 
150 b i l l i o n (US$4.5 b i l l i o n ) over the nex t ten years, most o f i t f ron t loaded in the f i r s t 3 to 5 
years. O f this, the Government i s anticipating Rs 80 b i l l i o n (US$2.4 b i l l i o n ) f r om loca l 
private investment; Rs. 70 b i l l i o n (US$2.1 b i l l ion ) f r om fo re ign investment, and the 
remainder (US$300 m i l l i o n ) f r om pub l ic sector investment and fo re ign aid. The Government 
i s further costing and r e f i n i n g the program. Bank financing o f projects i s fully integrated in to 
the budget. As noted in the CPS, p o r t f o l i o performance has been satisfactory. Government 
has requested that the B a n k finance up t o 100 percent o f the costs o f i n d i v i d u a l operations,

Reflecting Mau r i t ius ’ past success and imp roved access to capital markets, o f f i c i a l donor 
assistance t o the country declined over the past few years, and has become mo re selective. 
The few donors that are active in Mau r i t ius are cooperating on specific programs, notably in 
wastewater, and stepping up ove ra l l coordination at the strategic leve l . Though donors have 
played a re la t ive ly sm a l l ro le in Mau r i t ius in the past few years, the Government i s stepping 
up its efforts t o win financial, technical and mo ra l support f r om the outside wo r ld . As 
described ea r l ie r , imp roved donor coordination in l i n e w i t h the ha rmon iza t ion agenda i s an 
unde r ly ing p r inc ip le o f this CPS. 

Donors to Mau r i t ius include the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the 
W o r l d Bank, Agence Francaise de Developpement, the Ind ian Government, the Chinese 
Government, the Kuwait Fund, the A f r i c a n Development Bank, and the A rab Bank f o r 
Economic Development. In addition, the I M F i s he lp ing the Government with f isca l po l icy . 

The IMF has n o lend ing p rog ram in Mau r i t ius g iven the country’s strong macroeconomic 
position, but i t conducts rou t ine macroeconomic surveillance. Co l labo ra t ion with the IMF 
w i l l continue; fo r example, the Bank i s w o r k i n g with IMF o n the A id f o r Trade work, and 
going on j o i n t missions on the f isca l impact o f transition. 

The EU i s present in M a u r i t i u s and has been active in the areas o f env i ronmen t (particularly 
the wastewater sector) and pove r ty reduc t ion fo r the most vulnerable, ma rg ina l ized groups 
who are not bene f i t ing f r om Mau r i t ius ’ development success . The European Comm iss ion i s 
currently preparing i t s Coun t ry Strategy Paper fo r Mau r i t ius in con junc t ion with the Bank’s

fo l lowed b y non targeted budget support together w i t h the W o r l d B a n k and the French 
government in 2007-2008 and beyond. Like the Bank’s Rapid Response TA Fac i l i ty , the 
European Commission w i l l set aside some resources in a technical cooperation fac i l i ty (TCF) 
for Government reques ts as they arise. The Bank and EU w i l l coordinate o n the analytical 
and advisory activities th rough these fac i l i t ies to better fill know ledge gaps o r other needed 
non lending support. The E C w i l l also continue direct support t o non-State actors. The 
European Investment B a n k w i l l continue to wo rk in Mau r i t ius , pa r t icu la r ly o n infrastructure 
investments. 

The Agence Francaise de Developpement has also con f i rmed i t s support to Mau r i t ius ’ 
transition as the country moves towa rd greater integration in the w o r l d economy, through 
better p roduc t iv i ty and competitiveness. The AFD has proposed t o support the investments in

regulation, and increase c la r i ty and transparency, t o open up the economy and that g r ow t h

the sense that the pub l ic sector was n o t m o v i n g fo rwa rd . There was a recogn i t ion that 
Mau r i t ius i s no t competitive: labo r costs and unemployment were increasing; g r ow t h was 
be ing strangled b y constraints in education and t ra in ing and there i s a need f o r skilled people. 
Other suggestions were to encourage clustering among sectors and sma l l companies; 
d ive rs i fy agriculture and find n iche markets. Other i s s u e s were raised such as land, h o w to 
operationalize Mau r i t ius as a know ledge hub, and a few participants s t ressed the importance
