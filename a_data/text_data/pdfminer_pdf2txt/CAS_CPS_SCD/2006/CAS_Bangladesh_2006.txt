COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR 
THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH 

EXECUTIVE SUMMAFtY 

i. 

Bangladesh has recorded impressive economic and social gains since t h e 1990s. The country 
has doubled per capita growth and taken large strides toward reaching some M i l l e n n i um 
Development Goals (MDGs). Values on key social indicators a re much better than wou ld be 
predicted fo r a country at i t s income leve l . These gains have occurred despite w ide ly he ld 
perceptions o f poor governance. Bangladesh scores l ow o n most global governance indicators, and 
investors rank corruption among the i r most serious concerns. 
ii. H o w h a s Bangladesh done so w e l l despite such poor governance? Exp la in ing t h i s 
conundrum requires unbundling governance, recognizing bo th successes and failures. Bangladesh 
has seen slow but steady gains in pub l ic accountability, w i t h successive f r e e elections, an 
increasingly assertive Supreme Court, a rap id ly growing and active c i v i l society, and a relatively free 
media. T h e state has encouraged the emergence o f a vigorous private sector through sound 
macroeconomic management and trade liberalization. Financial sector governance i s improving, and 
successive governments have allocated pub l ic resources wisely, emphasizing pro-poor expenditures. 
Governments have made room for and forged strong partnerships w i t h NGOs, wh ich have 
contributed to the impressive development gains. On the other s ide are the governance failures. T h e 
increasingly unhealthy competition and lack o f t r u s t between the two major po l i t ica l parties sours the 
po l i t ica l climate and i s a major governance weakness. The high cost o f elections feeds pub l ic 
corruption. An overly centralized state reduces pub l ic accountability in the delivery o f services. An 
inadequate revenue effort and weak pub l ic financial management undermine t h e effectiveness o f 
pro-poor spending policies and foster corruption. A weak c i v i l service and justice sector compromise 
the delivery o f essential services, including law and order. 

THE GOVERNMENT’S PRSP AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

iii. The Government’s recently completed Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), 
“Unlocking the Potential,” recognizes that despite past gains, a large unfinished agenda remains. 
Some 63 m i l l i o n people l i v e in deprivation, two-thirds o f these in extreme poverty. Inequality i s 
rising. Adult i l l i te racy i s persistent. Ma lnu t r i t ion leve ls and maternal mo r ta l i ty ratios are among the 
highest in the world. A t ta in ing t h e MDGs calls fo r accelerating economic growth t o 6-7 percent a 
year. This w i l l no t be easy. Garment exports, three-quarters o f a l l exports, are vulnerable to 
competition f r om low-cost producers now that the M u l t i f i b r e Arrangement (MFA) has come t o an 
end. The availability o f cultivable land i s declining. Accelerating g row th w i l l require h i g h e r 
investment levels-to 
aid diversification in to areas o f comparative advantage and to finance 
infrastructure-and 
h ighe r productivity. This in tum calls fo r a substantial improvement in the 
investment climate, harmed by perceived high levels o f corruption and lack o f transparency. 
Attaining the social development goals w i l l require accountable and responsive social service 
de l ive ry systems that reach the poor. Raising p roduc t iv i ty and reaching the more d i f f icu l t goals fo r 
maternal mo r ta l i ty and ma lnu t r i t ion w i l l require imp rov ing the quality o f education and health 
services. And t h i s w i l l require imp rov ing institutional accountability and incentive structures, s t i l l 
very weak as a result o f a poo r ly functioning and overly centralized bureaucracy operating within 
one o f t h e most centralized countries in the world. These gains in quality w i l l also depend on 
improvements in the quality o f loca l governance. Improvements in the investment climate and 
service delivery also require stronger core governance. The modest revenue effort needs to be 
enhanced, and pub l ic financial management, inc lud ing procurement, strengthened to reduce 
leakages. And greater pub l ic access t o in fo rma t ion w i l l be needed i f c i v i l society and the pub l ic are 

i 

to h o l d government accountable fo r service delivery. As the PRSP puts it, “a major t h r u s t o f the PRS 
has to be o n ensuring good governance”.’ 

THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

iv. 
This assistance strategy i s aligned w i t h the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy, w i t h 
governance as the core focus across that strategy’s two pillars: improv ing the investment climate and 
empowering the poo r . T h e Bank Group’s program w i l l address sector governance issues in bo th 
pillars, as w e l l as core governance issues. T h i s mainstreaming o f governance implies that a l l Bank 
Group interventions w i l l be as much about governance as they w i l l be about improving sector 
performance. W h i l e the focus o n governance w i l l be broad, the Bank w i l l selectively support 
m e a n i n g h l reforms in key high-priority areas, highlighted below, where progress i s bo th important 
and possible. 

P i l l a r 1: Im p r o v i n g the Inves tmen t C l ima te . The Government’s strategy as l a i d out in the PRSP 

h a s two primary aims: First, t o ensure a stable macroeconomy and enabling business environment by 
imp rov ing trade policies, enhancing the legal and regulatory environment fo r the private sector, 
developing an effective competition policy, establishing policies friendly to foreign direct 
investment, and deepening financial sector reforms. Second, t o strengthen sectors c r i t ica l to pro-poor 
growth, inc lud ing agriculture, infiastructure, water resource management, and information and 
communication technology. The Bank Group w i l l build o n Bangladesh’s s treng ths by continuing to 
help maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate i t s progress toward an open, market-based 
economy. At the same time i t w i l l help the Government address weaknesses in the investment 
climate by remov ing the significant po l icy and institutional constraints t o infrastructure p rov is ion 
and imp rov ing i t s weak regulatory quality. The p r inc ipa l focus w i l l be to improve governance and 
eJjciency 
in 
infrastructure by 
reducing opportunities fo r co rmp t ion and nontransparent 
procurement prac t ices . The Bank Group w i l l help improve the po l icy environment fo r energy 
development by strengthening the institutional framework, addressing distorted pricing, and 
encouraging accountable and transparent processes that reduce po l i t ica l interference in investment 
decisions. The Bank Group w i l l also help address governance and institutional constraints facing the 
transport sector wh i le i t helps remove bottlenecks in t h e primary road network and supports 
improvements in the ma in transport corridor. 
P i l l a r 2: Em p ow e r i n g the Poor . The PRSP calls fo r imp rov ing the quality o f services wh i le seeking 
to attain and improve o n the MDGs. The W o r l d Bank w i l l build o n Bangladesh’s impressive social 
gains by helping the Government meet the MDGs wh i le also enhancing t h e quality and efficiency o f 
social service p rov is ion to the poor by strengthening sector governance and accountability and 
enhancing voice and participation. A principal new thrust o f the Bank’s strategy w i l l be in loca l 
governance. The W o r l d Bank, wo rk ing w i t h i t s development partners, w i l l attempt to enhance 
accountability by helping citizens participate in decisionmaking and h o l d service providers to 
account. I t w i l l help c la r i fy the assignment o f roles, responsibilities, and resources t o loca l 
governments t o a l low them to respond t o community priorities, strengthen the capacity o f 
communities t o h o l d t h e i r governments to account, and support capacity development in core 
functions aimed at strengthening accountability and transparency. I t w i l l also enhance voice and 
participation through additional community-driven development (CDD) operations. 
C o r e Governance. The principal focus in core governance w i l l be t o increase transparency 
and accountability and reduce opportunities fo r corruption. P r io r i ty w i l l be g iven to imp rov ingpub l ic 
f inanc ia l management and procurement. The Bank w i l l support a strategic development plan aimed 
at modernizing and reengineering the Na t iona l Boa rd o f Revenue to reduce co rmp t ion and improve 
tax collection. The Bank i s also wo rk ing w i t h the Government t o develop and implement a 
comprehensive, time-bound pub l ic financial management plan, inc lud ing a deepening o f the

promising initial refonns o f pub l ic procurement. T h e Bank and i t s development partners w i l l support 
the strengthening o f key institutions o f accountability, helping to create a transparent, fair, and 
independent process for selecting the leadership and senior management o f these agencies, ensuring 
their independence, and ensuring adequate compensation commensurate w i t h their responsibilities 
and special status. Active engagement w i t h c i v i l society and strategic partnerships are planned to 
help strengthen t h i s focus on imp rov ing accountability. 
T h e Bank’s interventions in core governance reflect i t s comparative advantage and mandate. 
vi. 
But the roots o f the governance crisis in Bangladesh l i e ma in ly in i t s po l i t ica l institutions. Thus 
addressing t h i s crisis requ i res re fo rm ing election finance, strengthening po l i t ica l parties (including 
through intraparty democracy), imp rov ing the quality o f po l i t ica l competition, and increasing the 
effectiveness o f Parliament as a key institution. T h e Bank Group intends t o rely o n i t s bilateral 
development partners to help Bangladesh address these issues. 
Longer-Term Strateg ic Issues. T h e potential fa l low period as Bangladesh enters i t s 
election cycle creates an opportunity t o take an integrated view o f longer-term development 
challenges, including environmental issues, spatial development, urbanization, ins t i tu t ion building, 
and regional integration in Asia. The Bank w i l l wo rk w i t h think tanks , c i v i l society, and i t s 
development partners on these issues to help shape po l icy priorities in t h e next PRSP. 

vii. 

DELIVERING THE WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM 
viii. 

T h i s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has been prepared fo l low ing extensive internal 
reviews and external consultations. D raw ing o n the lessons learned, the Bank Group w i l l do many 
things differently in Bangladesh. I t w i l l pay more attention t o results. I t w i l l m a k e governance the 
central focus o f i t s wo rk and i t s guide in allocating resources. I t w i l l systematically invo lve 
beneficiaries and affected communities in i t s operations. I t w i l l build strong partnerships w i t h 
donors, academia, and c i v i l society in support o f i t s development agenda. I t w i l l operate in an open 
and transparent way and try t o be a reliable long-term development partner o f Bangladesh. And i t 
w i l l strengthen fiduciary safeguards and proactively manage i t s po r t fo l io . 
i x . World Bank Lending Instruments. Bangladesh’s allocation o f International Development 
Association (IDA) resources fo r FY 0 6 i s $750 m i l l ion , based o n i t s Country Po l icy and Institutional 
Assessment (CPIA) rating, i t s po r t fo l io performance, and the adjustment fo r the “governance factor” 
integral t o the performance-based allocation formula under t h e 14th replenishment o f IDA resources 
(IDA14). S i m i l a r lending levels are assumed fo r h t u r e years. T h i s leve l o f resources w i l l a l low t h e 
Bank to fo l low a strategy o f strong engagement, including through annual development po l icy loans. 
T h e Bank’s lending program w i l l be substantially influenced by the enhanced focus o n governance. 
Development Support Credits w i l l emphasize improvements in sector and core governance, and 
access to these credits w i l l be conditioned o n governance-related benchmarks. Investment projects in 
a particular sector w i l l focus o n the key governance constraints in that sector, wh i le others w i l l 
support improvements in loca l governance, financial management, and procurement. In addition, the 
Bank w i l l increasingly re ly o n C D D operations that directly empower the poor. The Bank ’s program 
o f analytical and advisory activities (AAA) w i l l also be managed more strategically to support 
governance reforms. 
x. 
I F C and M IGA Programs. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), w i t h a current 
po r t fo l io o f $132.5 m i l l i o n in n i n e projects, expects to continue to provide direct support t o the 
private sector, with a special emphasis o n infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing sector projects. 
I F C w i l l also support the development o f loca l capital markets and a competitive banking sector. The 
South As ia En te rp r ise Development Fac i l i ty (SEDF) w i l l continue to provide technical assistance to 
financial intermediaries, small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), and professional service f i r m s 
that support SMEs. The Mu l t i la te ra l Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), w i t h an exposure o f 
$112 m i l l i o n in f i v e contracts, plans t o support foreign investors in telecommunications,

Partnerships, Aid Coordination, and Harmonization. The Bank Group has prepared t h i s 

Managing the Bank’s Fiduciary Risk The Bank w i l l implement a r o l l i n g Operational Risk 

infrastructure, and natural resources and provide technical assistance to the Boa rd o f Investment and 
support to the Export Processing Zones Authority. 
xi. 
M i t iga t ion P lan now be ing developed for implementation. The plan w i l l comprise several key 
building blocks: carrying out, through AAA and in project preparation, a systematic analysis o f 
corruption risk in sectors o f potential engagement; designing s m a r t projects that reduce corruption 
r i s k s ; strengthening supervision efforts, including through a systematic annual review o f projects 
assessed t o be at high fiduciary r isk ; more rigorously pursuing the remedies open to the Bank when 
corruption i s found; and enhancing the disclosure o f information that wou ld facilitate oversight o f 
project implementation by c i v i l society and beneficiaries. 
x i i . 
CAS j o i n t l y w i t h three o f Bangladesh’s largest development partners, the Asian Development Bank 
(ADB), the United Kingdom’s Department fo r International Development (DFID), and Japan. This 
j o i n t CAS reflects agreement o n the country context, the outcomes the four partners wou ld 
collectively l i k e t o support, and the strategies needed to attain these, and ensures that the partners’ 
separate bus iness plans complement rather than compete w i t h one another. This partnership i s 
supportive o f current efforts t o harmonize donor activities around a Government-led development 
strategy and government systems. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Implementation Forum o f 
November 2005 was chaired by the Government and i s now part o f an annual process to monitor 
implementation o f the PRSP. The Government w i l l also undertake periodic progress reviews w i t h 
the Loca l Consultative Group. The Bank w i l l develop strong partnerships w i t h c i v i l society, 
academic institutions, and t h e private sector, wo rk ing w i t h them to help forge consensus o n d i f f icu l t 
issues relating to governance or other contentious po l icy matters and encouraging them to contribute 
to the Bank’s AAA and lending activities as appropriate. 
x i i i . 
Implementing the CAS. D o i n g business differently w i l l require changes in staffing, 
institutional processes, and culture. Staffing adjustments w i l l start w i t h strengthening the governance 
focus and credentials o f core members o f the country team. T o manage f iduc ia ry and implementation 
risks, the operations adviser in Dhaka w i l l chair an Operations R i s k M i t i g a t i o n Team that w i l l help 
implement the Operational Risk M i t iga t ion Plan. Cultural change w i l l prove the most d i f f icu l t . 
Implementing the CAS effectively w i l l require cross-sectoral work, stronger country team alignment 
o n acceptable r isks , and a common understanding o f expectations relating to governance w i t h i n 
projects and AAA. The process o f change w i l l require persistence and continuous effort, as we l l as 
management attention to t h e incentives facing country team members. 

RISKS AND MITIGATION 

xiv. Mee t ing the CAS objectives involves significant r i s k s that the Bank Group w i l l need to 
address. The most severe i s the risk o f a significant worsening in the po l i t ica l climate and in the law- 
and-order situation as the country enters i t s election cycle. The Bank Group w i l l proactively monitor 
t h e situation and use the m id te rm review o f the CAS t o adjust the assistance strategy. Moreover, 
there may be l i t t l e po l i t ica l appetite to address the reforms in governance that are central to the 
success o f t h i s strategy. The Bank Group w i l l need to wo rk with i t s partners to engage key reformers

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR 

THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH 

2. 

1. 
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r Bangladesh was discussed by the W o r l d 
B a n k ’ s Boa rd o f Executive Directors o n December 12, 2000, almost ten months before national 
elections and in a CAS Progress Report in June 2003, after the new government completed the 
country’s in te r im Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The new government, wh ich came to 
power in October 2001 after the third successive and largely peaceful elections since Bangladesh 
reemerged as a democracy, successfully res tar ted reforms o n critical fronts wh i le ensuring sound 
macroeconomic and fiscal management. This good performance enabled Bangladesh to move f r om 
the CAS’S l o w case to the base-case lending scenario in FY03, and the Bank Group initiated a 
strategic s h i f t , reengaging in c r i t ica l sectors and p rov id ing programmatic development po l icy lending 
t o support implementation o f the re fo rm program. Accordingly, t h e f i r s t Development Support 
Credit (DSC) was approved in June 2003. The three DSCs approved thus far have complemented a 
four-year Poverty Reduction and G row th Fac i l i ty (PRGF) arrangement by the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), also approved in June 2003. 
Deepen ing t h i s strategic s h i f t , the FY06-09 CAS aims to a l ign W o r l d Bank Group assistance 
w i t h t h e recently completed PRSP (discussed by the Board in January 2006 along with the Joint Staff 
Advisory Note). The PRSP reflects the country’s v is ion fo r “unlocking the development potential” o f 
Bangladesh, a potential amply demonstrated by the remarkable socioeconomic progress made in the 
past tw o decades despite serious governance challenges. T o accelerate poverty reduction, the PRSP 
i s strategically built on a po l icy triangle o f pro-poor growth, human development, and governance. In 
l ine w i t h t h e goals and priorities o f the PRSP, t h i s CAS aims t o help Bangladesh improve i t s 
investment climate and empower the poor wh i le placing governance at center stage, simultaneously 
addressing key sector governance issues in bo th CAS pillars and cross-cutting core governance 
issues and institutions. 
3. 
To promote the coordination and harmonization o f a id and increase development 
effectiveness, the W o r l d Bank Group has prepared t h i s CAS j o i n t l y w i t h the Asian Development 
Bank (ADB), the United Kingdom’s Department fo r International Development (DFID), and Japan. 
T h e j o i n t effort has been framed by a common understanding o f the PRSP and by agreement o n b o t h 
a common set o f broad outcomes and the strategies needed to help Bangladesh achieve these 
outcomes. Because o f institutional requirements, each partner has developed i t s ow n assistance 
strategy document, including complementary country programs fo r analytical and advisory services, 
technical assistance, and lending. 
4. 
Ths CAS puts a greater emphasis o n results, and a common results framework has been 
developed as part o f the j o i n t effort, inc lud ing indicators and milestones fo r outcomes consistent w i t h 
the PRSP. Implementation o f the PRSP faces several challenges, and the “ jo in t results matrix” 
recognizes these. G iven the d i f f icu l t po l i t ica l environment in Bangladesh, the Government has had to 
pu rsue reforms opportunistically. The CAS takes in to account the national elections expected t o take 
place in early 2007, recognizing that as t h i s date approaches, implementation o f the re fo rm agenda, 
and o f development programs and projects, w i l l become increasingly d i f f icu l t , with a new window 
fo r intensified re fo rm emerging on ly after a new government takes office. 

I. THE COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 

5 . 

T h e pe r iod since the last C o u n t r y Assistance Strategy has been an even t fu l one. A four- 
party alliance l e d by t h e Bangladesh Na t iona l Party (BNP) has been in o f f ice since October 2001. 
A f te r elections considered by international observers t o be free and fair, the BNP-led alliance 
replaced the incumbent government, com ing to power w i t h a two-thirds ma jo r i ty in a 300-seat 

Parliament. BN P had a popular mandate to tackle corruption, improve law and order, and reenergize 
the re fo rm agenda. I t s tern1 in office, however, h a s been characterized by a further worsening in i t s 
relations w i t h the ma in opposition party, the Aw am i League, leading to prolonged opposition 
boycotts o f Parliament, fi-equent hartals (work stoppages), and, more recently, po l i t ica l violence. A l l 
this has contributed to the increased turbulence o f po l i t ics in this young democracy. Moreover, in 
recent months a number o f ominous terrorist incidents have occurred, purportedly inspired by a 
banned organization in support o f the imposition o f shariah (Islamic law) in secular Bangladesh. 
6 . 
The po l i t ica l environment may become more d i f f icu l t as the country approaches i t s fourth 
consecutive democratic elections, wh ich should take place in early 2007. The current govemment 
completes i t s term in o f f ice in October 2006 and, as required by the Constitution, a caretaker 
government should be appointed w i t h i n 15 days o f the dissolution o f Parliament. The caretaker 
government, headed by a ch ie f adviser w i t h a l l the powers o f the p r ime minister: should, together 
w i t h the Election Commission, ensure that the elections are f ree and fair. 

B. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS 

7 . 
I n the context o f such tu rbu len t politics, a long w i t h poo r i n i t i a l conditions and 
vu lne rab i l i ty to n a t u r a l disasters, Bangladesh’s achievements in economic and social 

deve lopment have been rema rkab le . The c o u n t q h a s achieved steady economic g row th o f 4-5 
percent annually, relatively l ow inflation, and fairly stable domestic debt, interest, and exchange 
rates. This g row th pedomance, coupled w i t h an impressive decline in the population g row th r a t e 
f r om 2.5 percent in the 1980s to 1.7 percent in 1990-2004, h a s l e d to a doubling o f annual per capita 
GDP growth, f rom 1.6 percent in the 1980s to 3.3 percent in 1990-2004 (t.able 1). In per capita GDP 
g row th Bangladesh outperformed bo th IDA-only countries (1.8 percent) and low-income countries 
(3.0 percent) in t h e later period. This g row th record was accompanied by lower vo la t i l i ty due in part 
to the diminishing severity o f t h e impact o f natural d i ~ a s t e r s . ~

M o r e impo r tan t , Bang ladesh has taken la rge strides t ow a r d achieving the M i l l e n n i um 

Deve lopment Goals (MDGs). The country has outperformed most low-income countries o n a range 
o f social indicators. I t increased gross primary enrollment f rom 72 percent in 1980 to 98 percent in 
2001 and has already attained the MDG o f eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary 
enrollment. W i t h the sharp decline in infant mo r ta l i ty f r om 145 per 1,000 l ive births in 1970 to 46 in 
2003, and in c h i l d mo r ta l i ty f r om 239 per 1,000 t o 69, Bangladesh i s set t o achieve the targeted two - 
thirds reduction f rom 1990 levels by 2015. Food security has improved markedly, even fo r the very 
poor. There have also been steady gains in income poverty; the share o f the population in poverty 
declined f rom 59 percent in 1990 t o 50 percent in 2000, w i t h the m a l sector accounting fo r nearly 
four-fifchs o f t h i s decline. Bangladesh’s actual values fo r fertility, infant and ch i ld mortality, 
contraceptive prevalence, and crude birth and death rates are much better than wou ld be predicted for 
a country at i t s income leve l (table 2).

H o w has Bang ladesh done so we l l despite such poo r governance? Recent analysis 

11. 

Bang ladesh has seen some impressive successes in governance since the 1980s: 

The state has increased its accountability to citizens. The conduct o f three successive, relatively 
peaceful elections w i t h high tumouts and w i t h t h e incumbents los ing powe r tw ice in succession 
i s evidence of the g row ing ma tu r i ty o f the electorate. The rap id g row th o f c i v i l society and o f an 
increasingly mature and c r i t ica l media has amplified t h e voices o f the poor and o f citizens more

n fonna t ion . 

b e W o r l d Bank Ins t i tu te has developed a set o f indicators aimed at capturing these broad dimensions o f 
;ovemance. These perceptions-based indicators, which cover some 209 countries, have been used since 1998 
o measure performance in six m a i n dimensions o f governance: voice and accountability, po l i t ica l stability, 

:oveJnment efectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption.

The state has increasingly created space fo r the development of 
the p r iva te sector, through 
strong macroeconomic management’ and progress on trade liberalization. Trade in goods nearly 
doubled as a share o f GDP between 1990 and 2004, to 30.8 percent, reflecting bo th a rap id 
expansion in garment exports and a significant liberalization o f imports.6 Mo re recently, t h e 
Government has privatized or shut down some 5 5 state-owned manufacturing en te rp r ises ( f rom a 
total o f around 121 in FYO1) and reduced employment levels in these enterprises, visibly 
imp rov ing their fmances. The Government has also re l ied on the private sector to deliver 
essential public services such as secondary education. 
0 Sound macroeconomic policies and greater openness combined w i th the migration of 
Bangladeshi labor abroad have led to a surge in overseas remittances, which reached about 5 
percent o f GDP by the end o f the 1990s. Such remittances, together w i t h the earnings f rom 
peacekeeping operations, amount to $5-6 b i l l i o n a year. These funds directly benefit ru ra l 
families, includmg the poor, by helping to finance land purchases, agricultural inputs, and 
business start-ups as w e l l as improvements in education and health. M u c h o f Bangladesh’s 
g row th has come f r om a booming private ru ra l economy and private-enterprise-led industrial and 
export growth. 
Recent eforts 
to improve governance in the f inanc ia l sector have had a noticeable impact in 
improving the sector’s pe fomance . Measures to enhance the capacity o f the Bangladesh Bank 
(the central bank), one o f the key institutions o f accountability in the country, and changes in the 
regulatory framework have led t o improvements in the performance o f private commercial 
banks. These banks have met the Basle capital adequacy ratios, seen a sharp decline in 
nonperforming loans ( f rom 16 percent in 1998 to 3 percent in 2004 o n a net basis), and begun to 
strengthen the i r corporate governance. Although the performance o f nationalized commercial 
banks (NCBs) remains problematic, their nonperforming loans have also been reduced, f rom 27 
percent in 1998 t o 18 percent in 2004. N ew lending by NCBs has been capped, a ban o n new 
loans to defaulters has been strictly enforced, some 100 bank branches have been closed, and the 
NCBs ’ share o f loans has fallen f r om 70 percent in 2000 to 40 percent today. One o f the NCBs, 
the Rupa l i Bank, i s being brought to the po in t o f sale, and management o f the others i s being 
strengthened p r io r to their possible sale. 
Sustained allocations of pub l ic resources .for pro-poor activities have played a c ruc ia l ro le in 
ensuring wise allocation of pub l ic expenditures and thus in contributing to the strong poverty- 
reducing outcomes, such as by: 
Containing m i l i t a v spending at 1.1 percent o f GDP, much less than half the average fo r 
the region, leaving fiscal space fo r pro-poor spending. 
Financing r u r a l inj?astructure, particularly roads connecting about 1,400 o f 2,100 
growth centers and markets, and thus contributing to the significant increase in nonfarm 
activity, employment, and income. 
P rov id ing a sustained injection of pub l ic f i n d s for health and education combined w i t h 
progressive policies t o ensure participation, inclusion, and empowerment and strong 
partnerships w i t h the private sector and NGOs, a l l o f wh ich have contributed to 
Bangladesh’s strong progress in social outcomes. 
The state has made space for and forged partnerships w i t h NGOs to deliver pub l ic services. 
Unlike in many developing countries, where c i v i l society i s either crowded out or co-opted by 
the state, in Bangladesh successive governments have recognized the state’s inab i l i ty t o meet the

The fiscal deficit, contained at less than 5 percent o f GDP, was steadily reduced to around 4 percent in FY05 despite large flood-related 
expenditures. In f la t ion averaged around 5 percent in 1990-2003. 
The unweighted mean t a r i f f was reduced from 106.5 percent in 1989 to 16.6 percent in 2004, and many non- tar i f f barriers have been 
removed.

high pub l ic expectations fo r service delivery and chosen to carve out strategic par tnersh ips w i t h 
NGOs t o deliver such services as microfinance, health, education, drinking water, and sanitation. 
M ic ro f inance reaches around 65 percent o f the c o k t r y ’ s poor people. And NGOs account fo r 9 
percent o f health care expenditures and 8 percent o f p r ima ry enrollment. W h i l e the state 
continues to p lay the predominant role in health and education, these f i g u r e s show that NGOs 
provide a g row ing share. The leading Bangladeshi NGOs have evolved in to social enterprises 
w i t h considerable capacity for nationwide service delivery, creating a sound foundation fo r 
fu tu re social development and poverty reduction. 
The state has greatly improved its capacity fo r managing natural disasters. T h e macroeconomic 
and social impact o f natural disasters has been greatly reduced, and the resilience o f the poor has 
increased. The factors contributing to t h i s improvement include greater nonfarm incomes, 
policies that have reduced leakages in food distribution and allowed private sector imports, the 
highly effective and well-targeted Voluntary Group Feeding system, the construction o f cyclone 
shelters, and the establishment o f early w a n i n g ~ y s t e r n s . ~ The response capability o f c i v i l 
administrations has markedly improved, and government campaigns t o educate households o n 
food and water safety precautions during floods and cyclones have proved effective. NGOs p lay 
a major ro le in disaster prevention, recovery, and relief, and vigorous domestic opposition and a 
free press have motivated governments to respond promptly t o disasters. 

12. 

These successes are partially offset by some ma rked failures in governance: 

The state of po l i t ica l competition is unhealthy. Po l i t ica l power i s concentrated in two major 
parties, l e d by r i v a l families that have dominated Bangladesh’s po l i t ics since i t s independence. 
T h i s h a s discouraged the emergence o f intraparty democracy. A first-past-the-post system o f 
elections results in large stable majorities fo r governments, reducing the effectiveness o f 
Parliament by lessening the importance o f the opposition. The lack o f competition i s accentuated 
by a highly centralized state. In the absence o f elected regional g o v e m e n t s that exercise real 
po l i t ica l power, a change in power at the center leaves v i r tua l ly no th ing fo r the losers. The 
patron-client nature o f po l i t ics feeds the bitter relations and lack o f t r u s t between the tw o 
dominant po l i t ica l parties. Parliament has been ineffective in i t s ro le as a check o n the executive, 
and opposition parties o f different hues prefer t o mob i l ize pub l ic support fo r their cause o n t h e 
streets and through hartals. The dependence o f po l i t ica l pa r t ies o n muscle power leads to the 
criminalization o f po l i t ics and increasing po l i t ica l violence. M o r e recently, extremist religious 
movements have taken advantage o f the discord in the secular po l i t ica l leadership through a 
series o f violent incidents. Fractious po l i t ics are not unique t o Bangladesh; there are many 
s i m i l a r examples elsewhere in bo th the developing and the industrial world. B u t the fractiousness 
i s p rov ing costly by contributing t o po l i t ica l uncertainty and the poor investment climate. 
The formal legal mechanisms that regulate campaign f inanc ing activities are ineffective. As in 
many other democracies, developing and industrial alike, elections in Bangladesh cost far more 
to contest than candidates are allowed t o spend. Each candidate fo r Parliament i s permitted to 
spend up to Tk 500,000 in contesting constituencies that represent around 250,000 voters. W h i l e 
t h i s amount is no t particularly l o w in relative terms (16 U S cents o n a PPP basis per voter)., i t i s 
on ly a fraction o f the true cost o f fighting an election. The need to finance campaigns i s 
reportedly a major source o f the high levels o f c o m p t i o n in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the 
region. Moreover, the i l lega l i ty o f such funds reduces transparency and blurs the l ine between a 
parliamentarian’s pub l ic and p r iva te funds. In the absence o f efforts t o reduce the cost o f 
contesting elections, curb campaign spending, o r properly enforce rules relating t o t h e 
declaration o f a candidate’s assets and l iab i l i t ies and make such declarations public, the r i s k s o f 
state capture by those who bank ro l l candidates become significant.

Revenue mobilization is handicapped by p o o r governance. Bangladesh’s budgetary revenue 
effort has been abysmally low : tax revenue amounts to less than 10 percent o f GDP and comes 
f r om a ve ry small share o f the population. T h i s situation reflects the serious governance 
challenges facing the National Board o f Revenue (see paras. 103-05). The small tax base in turn 
creates huge incentives for corruption as w e l l as opportunities for rent seeking by forcing the 
Government to pay abysmally l ow salaries to c i v i l servants, reduce operations and maintenance 
expenditures, and force a rationing o f essential pub l ic services. 
Despite recent progress, pub l ic f inanc ia l management needs further strengthening to become an 
effective policymaking and accountability instrument for 
the Government. W h i l e pub l ic 
expenditure po l icy has many positive aspects (see para. ll), financial management systems 
remain weak, undermining the effectiveness o f the policy. The budget planning process lacks a 
medium-term strategic orientation, a l low ing discretionary behavior in budget planning and 
implementation. Wh i le efforts to introduce information technology in budget accounting and 
reporting are under way, manual systems are s t i l l used fo r a11 budgetary transactions, reducing 
the effectiveness and transparency o f expenditure management. Public financial accountability 
systems ins ide and outside the executive are at a nascent stage, and consolidating these systems 
w i l l require long, sustained efforts. Until recently procurement has been a major source o f 
corruption. A modern and effective legal framework fo r procurement has been developed and 
now needs to be implemented and i t s outcomes monitored. 
Budgetary constraints and failure to create transparent and accountable processes fo r p r iva te 
sector participation in infrastructure have contributed to the sector’s low levels of 
investment. 
Inadequate revenues and weak financial management contribute to the Government’s inab i l i ty t o 
fund infrastructure f r om the budget, while private p rov is ion has lacked transparency. There has 
been progress in some areas, such as telecommunications, where cellular operators have qu ick ly 
overtaken land l ines . But power shortages are cited by bus iness enterprises as their most 
important constraint, and po r t facilities are inefficient, corrupt, and failing to keep up w i t h 
demand, raising shipping costs and reducing competitiveness. Failure to create transparent and 
accountable processes fo r private participation in infrastructure and t o address p r ic ing issues h a s 
been a major constraint on investment in electricity, and powe r fu l interests tend to resist reforms 
in Chittagong port, the country’s largest. 
As in many developing countries, politicization, 
low salaries, and poo r human resource 
management have contributed to a steady deterioration in the quality of 
the c iv i l sewice as w e l l 
as other government services, such as the po l ice and t h e judiciary. T h e c i v i l service today, w i t h 
some important exceptions, i s increasingly poo r ly trained, highly hierarchical and secretive, and 
open to po l i t ica l pressures. Moreover, the c i v i l service sees i tse l f as accountable to i t s higher- 
leveI masters rather than to Bangladeshi citizens, whom i t i s supposed to serve. T h i s situation 
has eroded the quality o f pub l ic service delivery and regulation while undermining 
accountability and increasing the fiduciary r i s k s t o pub l ic funds. Wh i le the wise decision to 
develop strategic partnerships w i t h the private sector and NGOs has mitigated the costs to the 
country, c i v i l service management and performance issues cloud prospects fo r t h e country’s 

fu ture . 

T h e jus t ice sector is dys@nctional. Despite an activist and vigilant Supreme Court, the justice 
sector faces serious challenges o f inefficiency and corruption. L aw and order i s weak, and crime 
i s underreported and poo r ly investigated. The police, the citizens’ first po in t o f contact w i t h t h e 
formal justice system, are he ld in l i t t l e confidence. Bangladesh has the lowest ra t io o f po l ice t o 
citizens o n the subcontinent. About 70 percent o f i t s police officers (around 80,000) are 
constables, poo r ly trained and equipped and w i t h l im i ted authority, education, and skills. And 
on ly 1.2 percent o f the po l ice force i s female. The focus o f the c r im ina l justice system appears to 
be o n maintaining pub l ic order and protecting t h e wealthy and powe r fu l rather than preventing, 
detecting, and investigating crime. The lowe r courts are particularly ine f f ic ien t and corrupt. As 

7 

the PRSP notes, “ a n inherited colonial system of c r im ina l and c iv i l jus t ice which ensures 
‘certainty of expense but zmceytainty of 
results’ poses major barriers t o the poor in terms o f 
accessibility and affordability.”’ Moreover, enforcing a contract through a court costs three times 
as much in Bangladesh as i t does in China and requ i res half as many days o n average. Similarly, 
banks find i t nearly impossible to collect collateral o n defaulting loans. T h i s situation i s a major 
impediment to attracting foreign direct investment. A credible justice system that enforces clear 
laws in a just, transparent, and efficient manner i s essential to create the stable, predictable, and 
secure environment necessary fo r investment and to ensure the human security that i s integral to 
sustainable development and poverty reduction.

H o w has Bangladesh’s re la t ive ly strong economic a n d social pe r fo rmance coexisted 

with poo r governance? Tw o factors need to be recognized. First, judgments about the quality o f 
governance in Bangladesh need t o take a sufficiently nuanced view. T h e analysis above shows that 
governments o f d i f fe r ing po l i t ica l persuasions have pursued fa i r ly sound economic p o l i c y stances 
w i t h respect to a commitment to nlacroeconomic stability and economic openness, adopted a private- 
sector-led development strategy, created space for NGOs to operate and complement government 
efforts, and allocated pub l ic resources sensibly, particularly in terms o f pro-poor spending. 
Second, policymakers creating space fo r the private sector and NGOs wou ld not be 
remarkable in i t s e l f but fo r the fact that the private sector and NGOs have taken advantage o f t h i s 
space to deliver g row th and services. By creating a duty-free environment through bonded 
warehouses, fo r example, the Government enabled the ready-made garment sector to get around the 
constraints o f a corrupt tax administration. Similarly, by encouraging p rov is ion o f social services by 
the private sector and NGOs, the Government compensated fo r weak governance and poor public 
service delivery and allowed i tse l f to concentrate o n i t s proper ro le as a regulator and provider o f 
pub l ic health services. 
These steady but largely untnunpeted and insu f f ic ien t ly recognized gains are often 
overshadowed by the much noisier failures o f t h e country’s po l i t ica l governance and the corrupt 
elements in i t s elite. I t i s these f a i l u r e s that tend to be captured in the perceptions-based data on 
governance, wh ich have no t yet been extended to broader dimensions o f govemance. Ana lys ts 
outside the country therefore seem to o f ten overlook i t s strong economic and social outcomes and the 
good po l icy governance that underpins these outcomes. The above and other reforms (attachment 
10) taken by various governments have been instrumental in delivering the good social and 
economic outcomes Bangladesh registers at present. 
16. 
But the price that Bangladesh pays fo r poor governance may be r is ing to the po in t where i t 
begins to seriously undermine the effectiveness o f the country’s development efforts. The 
increasingly fractious po l i t ics and the po l i t ica l uncertainty they breed are a major factor in the poor 
investment climate, particularly fo r foreign direct investment, offsetting the Government’s pro- 
private-sector stance. Foreign investors t h a t might have been attracted by the Government’s ‘open 
economy’ policies are put o f f by poor infrastructure, the inab i l i ty o f the justice sector t o enforce 
contracts, the deteriorating l aw and order, and the high l e v e l o f corruption in regulatory agencies. 
Moreover, wh i le govemment policies have been sound, implementation has always been weak and i s 
steadily deteriorating, reflecting the failure to address institutioiial weaknesses and re fo rm the c i v i l 
service. The fa i lu re t o control corruption and the deteriorating l aw and order are symptoms o f a 
larger failuse o f governance, re f lec t ing t h e perverse incentives arising fi-om the high cost o f 
contesting elections, the po l i t ic iza t ion o f the c i v i l service, and the steady, long-term erosion in i t s 
quality and in t h e qua l i ty o f law enforcement. In addition, govemment responses t o weaknesses in 
implementation, often compelled by pressure f r om the pub l ic due t o the relatively free media a d 
active c i v i l society, have tended t o be ad hoc. Experience in other countries shows that such 
responses typ ica l ly fail t o systematically address institutional weaknesses. Innovations and

improvements often have proved unsustainable and rarely su rv ive t h e departure o f inspired leaders- 
and may even become problems themselves, as w i t h the excesses committed by the Rapid Ac t ion 
Battalion. 
N o r can the sustainability o f past social achievements be taken fo r granted. The early gains 
took up t h e slack in the system. Further progress toward the ambitious MDGs w i l l prove d i f f icu l t i f 
the Government fails to address underlying institutional weaknesses. Giving p r io r i ty to pro-poor 
resource allocations w i l l not be enough. Doctors and other health care providers must reach mothers 
needing pre- and postnatal care. And teachers need to attend schools. Similarly, a pro-private-sector 
stance w i l l no t be enough to address the massive underinvestment in infrastructure-particularly 
the 
underinvestment in energy, wh ich accounts fo r the current energy crisis in Bangladesh. The solution 
also requ i res tackling the growing lack o f transparency in deals reIating t o private provision o f 
infrastructure . 

11. UNLOCKING BANGLADESH'S P O T E N T L A STRATEGY FOR 
ACCELERATED POVERTY REDUCTION 

A. BANGLADESH'S DEVELOPMENT VISION AND THE POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY 

18. 

Recognizing these challenges, the Government has outlined i t s v is ion in the 1 1 1 PRSP, 
"Unlocking t h e Potential," released in October 2005. T h e PRSP appropriately stresses the l i n k s 
be tween investment, growth, j o b creation, and poverty reduction. I t identifies key areas where 
reforms are needed, pub l ic investments are required, and pub l ic policies me r i t improvement. I t does 
no t shy away f r om tackling d i f f icu l t issues, according a prominent place t o combating corruption, 
restoring r u l e o f law, and mak ing governance wo rk fo r the poor. I t builds o n past achievements, aims 
to prevent slippages in areas where progress has been made, and addresses weaknesses in 
implementation, emphasizes t h e centrality o f employment creation, and strengthens the focus on 
women's empowerment. 
As the Joint Staff Adv iso ry No te (JSAN)" observes the PRSP v is ion appropriately builds o n 
the po l icy triangle o f growth, human development, and governance and argues fo r special attention 
to goals and outcomes in the fo l low ing areas: 

19 . 

0 Employment generation. 
0 Nu t r i t ion . 
0 Maternal health. 
0 Qua l i ty o f education. 
Sanitation and safe water. 
C r im ina l justice system. 
0 Loca l governance. 
T h e PRSP emphasizes that progress toward these goals requires creating an open, 
competitive environment conducive to private investment, with particular importance given t o 
exports and the rural sector, where 85 percent o f Bangladesh's poor people live." 
imp rov ing t h e 
ab i l i ty o f poo r people t o participate more fully in the g row th process, through access t o better-quality 
education, health, water, and nutrition; and, most important, ensuring that the Government addresses 
b o t h sector governance concerns and core governance issues, such as by imp rov ing government 
capacity, promoting loca l governance, tackling corruption, enhancing access to justice fo r the poor,

T h i s would be the case, for example, in t h e appointment o f unusually effective individuals to head key institutions, such as the 
Bangladesh Bank, or the creation o f t h e Rapid Action Battalion to bolster a weak police force.

on ensuring good governance ”. l2 
21. 
The JSAN, however, notes that t h e PRSP lacks a well-thought-out process o f growth 
acceleration to justify t h e high g row th projections, and that despite the focus o n a private-sector- 
driven g row th agenda, there i s too much reliance on pub l ic rather than private investments. 
Moreover, a more comprehensive review should have been done o f the trade po l icy regime, wh ich 
impinges o n growth. The omission o f a strategic vision for t h e development o f the fmancial sector 
also weakens the pro-poor g row th agenda presented in the PRSP. Wh i le the PRSP recognizes 
infrastructure as an important impediment to growth and poverty reduction, i t needs a greater focus 
on imp rov ing governance in these sectors, especially power. The lack o f specificity o n sectoral 
governance reforms, despite the very welcome strong focus on overall governance, suggests a need 
to broaden the ownership o f governance reforms w i t h i n the Government. Finally, to b e a credible 
instrument, the PRSP requires a clear plan fo r implementation and monitoring--mainstreamed in the 
Government’s processes fo r po l icy formulation, implementation, and monitoring-that wou ld 
facilitate p r io r i t iza t ion and achievement o f i t s goals. 

B. DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

1. T h e Pove r ty Cha l lenge 

22. 
T h e P R S P recognizes that Bangladesh’s progress in social and economic development 
and the w a y f o rw a r d should b e seen in re la t ion to the magn i tude o f the pove r ty ~ h a 1 l e n g e . l ~ 
Wh i le income poverty in bo th urban and ru ra l areas declined by one percentage po in t a year in the 
1990s-an 
impressive 9 percentage points over t h e decade-the absolute number o f people below 
the poverty l ine has no t changed. Some 63 m i l l i o n people l i v e in deprivation, two-thirds o f them 
caught in extreme poverty. Poverty has fallen unevenly across regions, w i t h most o f the gains in the 
Dhaka d iv is ion and large pockets o f poverty remaining in Rajshahi, Chittagong, and Khulna. 
Moreover, inequality i s rising, making the task o f reducing poverty even more d i f f icu l t . A t ta in ing the 
key income poverty goals w i l l requ i re accelerating the rate o f income poverty reduction substantially 
beyond the 1.5 percent a year achieved in 1990-2002. Adult i l l i te racy i s persistent and falling on ly 
slowly, particularly among women. With ma lnu t r i t ion l e v e l s in South As ia s t i l l among the highest in 
the world, Bangladesh’s relatively good perfonnance compared w i t h India’s and Pakistan’s i s l i t t l e 
solace. M o r e than half the children ages one to three are underweight, and more than 40 percent o f 
women are severely malnourished. Maternal mo r ta l i ty i s high as a result o f inadequate access to 
health services during pregnancy and ch i ldb i r th and t h e poor nu t r i t iona l status o f pregnant women.

23. 
These challenges a r e re f lec ted in Bangladesh’s progress a n d prospects on a t ta in ing 
MDGs, whe re the p ic tu re i s m ixed . As noted, the country has made remarkable progress toward 
several MDGs. Several others are within reach, though attaining them w i l l require special attention 
and concerted effort. And some w i l l challenge the country fo r some t ime (see attachment 2). A 
m ixed picture i s thus emerging, as tw o recent MDG assessments ~ u g g e s t : ’ ~ 
0 Bangladesh has already attained the MDGs relating to gender pa r i ty i n schooling opportunities 
and universal p r ima ry education. I t is the only country in South As ia other than S r i Lanka to 
have achieved parity in male and female enrollment at not j u s t the primary but also the

secondary leve l . A t ta in ing two other MDGs-reduction o f consumption poverty and under-five 
mortality--is also feasible, through a m i x o f sector-specific interventions (such as expanding 
immunization coverage and reducing pupil-teacher ratios), economic growth, improved coverage 
o f infrastnicture, and social safety ne t programs. A t ta in ing the MDG relating to ch i ld 
ma lnu t r i t ion and those in education relating t o un iversa l net p r ima ry enrollment and primary 
completion remains challenging but w i t h i n reach. Fo r ch i ld malnutrition, t h e projections suggest 
that Bangladesh could come ve ry close-within 5 percentage points-to 
the MDG o f having no 
more than 34 percent o f i t s children underweight by 2015. Whether Bangladesh i s l i k e l y to 
achieve net primary enrollment and primary completion rates exceeding 83-86 percent by 2015 
rema ins unclear. 
Attaining t h e ma terna l mor ta l i ty goal w i l l be challenging fo r Bangladesh. The country has the 
lowest maternal mo r ta l i ty ratio in South Asia, but the region’s indicators are among the worst in 
the world. In 2001 Bangladesh’s ratio was in the range o f 320-400 maternal deaths per 100,000 
live births. T o meet the target Bangladesh must reduce t h i s figure to 143 per 100,000 l i v e births, 
wh ich w i l l requ i re inducing m j o r behavioral changes in mothers, vastly expanding access to 
quality reproductive health services, and broadly imp rov ing the socioeconomic situation. 
Bangladesh had nearly achieved the safe water goal, w i t h 97 percent o f i t s population having 
access t o pathogen-free water. But arsenic contamination posed a new round o f challenges, and 
the population share w i t h access to pathogen- and arsenic-free water i s now roughly 80 percent 
in urban areas and 70 percent in ru ra l areas. The Government’s “total sanitation” program has 
been a real success in ru ra l areas, achieving broad coverage. But new challenges to attaining the 
MDG fo r sanitation are emerging, driven in part by urbanization: on ly 14 percent o f s l u m 
dwellers in urban areas have access to sealed latrines, and the urban population i s projected to 
nearly double-to 50 m i l l i o n people-by 20 1 5. 
Reversing the trend o f deforestation and increasing energy efficiency weigh heavily o n the MDG 
agenda o f ensuring environmental sus ta inab i l i ty . The financial and institutional resources needed 
to accomplish these objectives pose significant challenges to attainment o f t h i s MDG. 

3. Mac roeconom ic Pe r fo rmance a n d Prospects 

24. 

I n the face o f these challenges, achieving the PRSP’s pove r ty reduc t ion objectives a n d 
re la ted MDGs will r e q u i r e that Bang ladesh no t on ly maintain i t s cu r ren t achievements in 
good, stable growth-but, m o r e impo r tan t , move to a h ighe r and m o r e equ itab le g row th path 

o f 6-7 percent a yea r (see attachment ). The country’s GDP g row th performance h a s been good fo r 
almost two decades, averaging 5.4 percent a year in FYO1-05, the highest five-year average since 
independence. This g row th was underpinned by a resurgence o f domestic private investment, wh ich 
grew at an average annual rate o f 10 percent, increasing i t s share in GDP f r om 16 percent in FYOl to 
18.5 percent in FY05.15 W h i l e benefiting f r om continued strong export g row th (about 8 percent a 
year), w i t h garment exports the mainstay, growth has also been relatively broad based. Construction 
and services sectors have seen particularly strong growth, fueled by large in f lows o f remittances. 
25. 
Strong g row th in exports and remittances has also benefited the external sector. Exports 
increased by 40 percent and remittances doubled in FY00-05, wh i le imports rose by 50 percent. T h e 
current account recorded small surpluses in FYO2-04 before slipping in to a deficit equaling 0.9 
percent o f GDP in FY05 . T h e sharply rising cost o f o i l and other commodity imports added t o the 
current account deficit in the latest year. Benefiting f r om a pick-up in concessional and other long- 
term capital inflows, foreign exchange reserves increased f r om their precarious leve l o f $1 b i l l i o n 
(one mon th o f impo r t cover) at the end o f 2001 to a more comfortable $3 b i l l i o n by the end o f FY05. 

l5 Meanwhile, the share of public investment f e l l fmm 7 percent o f GDP to 6 percent 

11 

26. 
T h e Government 's med ium - te rm macroeconomic f r am ew o r k in the PRSP commits to 
acce lerat ing GDP g row th f r o m 5.4 percent in FY05 to 6.0 percent in FY 0 6 a n d 6.5 percent in 

F Y O S . Such an acceleration o f g row th wou ld requ i re a substantial increase in investment and 
productivity levels. Productivity g row th in turn w i l l depend o n improvements in infrastructure 
p rov is ion and labor quality, wh ich as t h e JSAN notes w i l l take t im e t o b r ing about. Tw o major 
sources o f g row th are highly vulnerable, however, po in t ing t o the need fo r diversification o f the 
economy. Garment exports, three-quarters o f the country's total exports o f goods, face greater 
competition f r om low-cost producers such as China w i t h the dismantling o f the Agreement on 
Textiles and C lo th ing since January 2005. The availability o f cultivable land, an important source o f 
past agricultural growth, has been declining, in part because o f urbanization and iilfrastructure 
development. W h i l e these potential threats ca l l fo r efforts to enhance the competitiveness o f exports 
and p roduc t iv i ty o f agriculture, there i s also l i t t l e alternative to policies encouraging the 
diversification o f the economy beyond these sectors. Key to meeting the h ighe r g row th target w i l l be 
attracting foreign investment - a p r io r i ty whose urgency, the JSAN argues, i s no t sufficiently 
reflected in the PRSP. Attracting such investments w i l l require substantially imp rov ing t h e 
investment climate. This in turn w i l l require addressing the ma in constraints confronting private 
investors, such as infrastructure shortages (particularly power and ports), poor law and order, high 
levels o f corruption, and the weak regulatory environment. And removing the infrastructure 
constraints w i l l require better governance and more transparent private provision o f infrastructure. 

27. 
Acce lerated g row th a n d cont inued fiscal prudence a r e expected to im p r o v e prospects 
f o r fiscal and debt sustainability, although, as the JSAN emphasizes, poo r revenue efforts and 
g row ing l iab i l it ies o f State O w n e d Enterpr ises (SOEs) r em a i n a concern. The Government 

lowered the fiscal deficit f r om around 5 percent o f GDP in FYOl to 3.5 percent in FYOS and 
adopted more prudent financing patterns, w i t h greater emphasis o n concessional external financing. 
As a resu l t , pub l ic sector debt has been contained at l e s s than 50 percent o f GDP and appears to be 
o n a sustainable path. Over the med ium te rm the Government's p rog ram i n the PRSP commits to 
maintainingJiscaZ de$cits at or below 4 percent o f GDP and limiting domestic financing t o about 2 
percent o f GDP. This reflects an expected improvement in total revenue collection, projected t o 
reach 12 percent o f GDP by FY09 as a result o f modernizing the National Boa rd o f Revenue and 
containing expenditures at 15.5 percent o f GDP. F isca l sustainability w i l l also depend, however, o n 
the Government's ab i l i ty t o contain the g row ing l iab i l i t ies o f the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation 
stemming f r om the recent increases in global o i l prices, wh ich have not yet been fully passed through 
t o consuniers-leading 
to losses equal to 0.7 percent o f GDP in FYO5." Continued monetary 
prudence w i l l be necessary to contain in f la t ion at the targeted rates o f 7 percent in FY06 and less 
than 5 percent by FY08. A l though external debt is relatively low, at about 33 percent o f GDP and 
mostly o n concessional tans, the country faces some medium-term liquidity risks because o f 
modest export levels (14 percent o f GDP in FY05).17 T h e JSAN, therefore, encourages the 
authorities t o further improve the wo rk ing o f the foreign exchange market and t o a l low the exchange 
rate to operate f lex ib ly in response to changes in economic fundamentals.

the emphasis o n a prioritized, selective approach. A key p r i o r i t y w i l l be pub l ic financial 
management. The rather modest revenue effort w i l l need to be eihanced, and pub l ic financial 
management, inc lud ing pub l ic procurement, w i l l need to be strengthened to ensure that scarce public 
funds reach their intended beneficiaries. This in turn calls fo r improvements in c i v i l service 
management. Access o f the poor t o justice w i l l be a high p r io r i ty , as w i l l broader improvements in 
t h e justice sector to ensure the r u l e o f law and reduce investor uncertainty about enforcement o f 
contracts. Public access to in fo rma t ion w i l l be key to such improvements in governance and t o the

A. THE STRATEGIC FOCUS-GOVERNANCE AT CENTER STAGE 
T h e W o r l d Bank G r o u p w i l l a l ign i t s C o u n t r y Assistance Strategy w i t h the 

30. 
Government’s Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy. I t w i l l make governance the core focus, cutting across 
the two pillars o f the Government’s strategy-improving 
the investment c l ima te and empowering the 
poor-while 
also addressing the core governance issues common t o these tw o pillars ( f igu re 1). 
Under pillar 1, imp rov ing the investment climate, the Bank Group w i l l build o n Bangladesh’s 
strengths by continuing to help maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate i t s progress toward 
an open, market-based economy. At the same time i t w i l l help the Government address weaknesses 
in t h e investment climate by remov ing po l icy and institutional constraints t o infiastructure provision 
and improving i t s weak regulatory quality. Under pillar 2, empowering the poo r , the Bank Group 
w i l l attempt to build o n Bangladesh’s impressive social gains by he lp ing the Government meet the 
MDGs relating t o human development wh i le also enhancing the quality and efficiency o f service 
provision to the poo r by strengthening sector governance and accountability and enhancing voice and 
participation. T h e Bank Group w i l l also respond to the po l icy opening in loca l governance by 
launching i t s f i r s t direct efforts to strengthen service delivery by loca l governments and enhance 
their accountability t o loca l communities. 
31. 
Progress under bo th pillars w i l l depend o n successful reforms in Bangladesh’s core 
governance. The Bank Group w i l l therefore assist in strengthening pub l ic financial management to 
help increase budgetary revenues and ensure better use o f pub l ic funds, and in revitalizing 
institutions that enhance pub l ic accountability. The Bank Group w i l l also j o i n i t s partners in helping 
to strengthen c i v i l society and provide access to information, bo th c r i t ica l i f citizens are to h o l d their 
government t o account. 
T h i s approach o f mainstreaming governance in the Bank Group’s program w i l l mean that i t s 
32. 
operations, whether in infrastructure, health, education, financial services, or any other sector, w i l l be 
as much about imp rov ing governance as they are about imp rov ing sector performance and service 
delivery. A special focus o n invo lv ing communities in program delivery and monitoring, through 
support fo r loca l governance and community-driven development (CDD) approaches, aims t o ensure 
that the onus o f enforcing accountability fo r results and management o f resources increasingly s h i f t s 
f iom the Bank Group and i t s development pa r tne rs t o beneficiaries, imp rov ing chances fo r success 
and sustainability. 

13 

33. 

Recognizing the interdependence o f the governance challenges facing Bangladesh, the Bank 
Group strategy covers a broad spectrum o f issues . However, heeding the sensible advice in the 
Government’s PRSP t o avoid dissipating donor resources fo r governance across too w ide a front, the 
Bank Group w i l l pragmatically focus i t s energies and resources o n four key areas that are sufficiently 
important t o use i t s po l i t ica l capital w i t h the Government to pursue r e s u l t s and where it i s believed 
that r e s u l t s can be achieved: imp rov ing governance and efficiency in infrastructure, especially 
power; supporting loca l governance and community-driven development initiatives that empower the 
poor by bringing governments closer to the people or invo lve beneficiaries in the design and 
implementation o f programs; imp rov ing the Government’s pub l ic financial management, inc lud ing 
mak ing procurement more competitive and transparent; and strengthening the Government’s tax and 
revenue effort. These areas w i l l be important avenues fo r delivering results in the Bank Group’s 
program (see attachment 1). At the same time the Bank Group w i l l maintain a modest leve l o f po l icy 
dialogue and lending engagement across a broader front, enabling i t t o respond qu ick ly to 
opportunities fo r re fo rm that may a r i s e in other areas and to support the w o r k o f i t s development 
partners. The fo l low ing sections outline t h e proposed program in more detail.

B. PILLAR 1: IMPROVING THE INVESTMENT CL IMATE 

34. 

A healthy investment climate i s essential t o generate the higher levels o f investment and 
p roduc t iv i ty needed t o sustain h ighe r g row th and absorb the new entrants t o Bangladesh’s g row ing 
labor force. I t i s especidly needed t o attract foreign direct investment (FDI), w i t h i t s technology 
t rans fe r and other productivity-enhancing spillover effects. A l though Bangladesh has, o n paper, the 
most l ibe ra l FDI regime in South Asia, FDI remains l o w (estinmted at 1 percent o f GDP in FY05). 
Investors clearly are deterred by perceptions o f high. po l i t ica l risk and by weaknesses in the 
implementation o f the l ibe ra l FDI regime, inc lud ing nontransparent tendering and contracting 
processes fo r private infrastructure investors, severe infrastructure shortages, high levels o f 
corruption that raise the cost o f do ing business, and other investment climate problems iden t i f ied in 
the 2003 Investment Climate Assessment. Wh i le t h e recent investor interest in natural-resource- 
based projects i s promising, these projects have not yet materialized, and the investment climate 

14 

36. 

35 . 

remains problematic for large and s m a l l investors a l i k e . Moreover, the investment climate in ru ra l 
areas-where most o f Bangladesh’s poor live-undermines 
the development o f agribusiness 
activities that could be the m a i n driver o f broad-based employment. 
The Government’s strategy as l a i d out in the PRSP has two primary aims: First, to ensure a 
stable macroeconomy and enabling business environment by imp rov ing trade policies, imp rov ing the 
legal and regulatory environment fo r the private sector, developing a n effective competition policy, 
establishing FD I - f r iend ly policies, and deepening financial sector reforms. Second, t o strengthen 
sectors c r i t ica l t o pro-poor growth, inc lud ing agriculture, infrastructure, water resource management, 
and information and communication technology (ICT). 
The Bank Group together w i t h several development partners w i l l focus onfour investment 
climate p r io r i t ies : maintaining macroeconomic stability; imp rov ing governance and efficiency in 
infi-astructure, especially power and ports; reducing trade restrictions and administrative barriers; and 
p rov id ing private-sector-friendly finance, land, and labor markets (table 3). Weak governance 
remains the ma in challenge in each o f these areas. As a n in teg ra l part o f i t s strategy the Bank Group 
w i l l therefore seek t o address the underlying institutional incentives that create opportunities fo r poor 
governance and corrupt behavior, undermining sector performance and better development 
outcomes. T o support private sector g row th and boost the competitiveness o f industry, the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) w i l l focus o n technical assistance and investments in 
financial institutions to support the development o f small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs); 
investments to support financial market development and growth o f the telecommunications and 
manufacturing sectors; and energy sector and infrastructure investments, subject t o progress o n 
governance and sector reforms and appropriate environmental and social safeguards. IFC w i l l focus 
in particular on supporting competitive manufacturing and services. Special emphasis w i l l be given 
t o encouraging FDI and regional integration through IFC inves tmen ts and technical assistance f r om 
the South As ia Enterprise Development Fac i l i ty (SEDF) and Foreign Investment Adv iso ry Service 
( F IA S ) . The Mu l t i la te ra l Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) w i l l provide support to foreign 
investors through po l i t ica l risk insurance, and support to the wider efforts to improve the investment 
climate through technical assistance t o build the capacity o f key government agencies focusing o n 
private sector development. In addition, IFC’s SEDF w i l l continue t o partner with FIAS o n a 
program to reduce administrative barriers, promote special economic zones, and build government 
capacity t o promote private investment.

1. Maintain Mac roeconom ic Stab i l ity 

37. 
Bangladesh has a good record o f maintaining macroeconomic stability. But recent changes 
in the external environment have revealed possible fiscal and balance o f payment vulnerabilities (see 
attachment 3). The budget has recently come under pressure because o f stagnating revenues, growing 
losses o f the state-owned energy enterprises (totaling about 0.8 percent o f GDP in FY05), pub l ic 
sector wage increases, and higher explicit and imp l ic i t budgetary subsidies. Meanwhile, the capacity 
to absorb concessional ex te rna l financing remains weak as a result o f weak implementation capacity. 
Improving Jiscal sustainability is therefore essential, w i th the p r i o r i t y being to reduce the losses of 
state-owned energy entelyrises and strengthen revenue administration (see paras. 103-05). 
38. 
The Bank w i l l continue to support fiscal adjustment through i t s po l icy dialogue and 
development p o l i c y lending, inc lud ing progressive alignment o f energy prices to international levels 
t o lower the losses o f the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, loss reduction programs and rollback 
o f state ownership in remaining state-owned enterprises (where the Bank i s supporting voluntary 
retirement schemes and retrenchment costs fo r closed or privatized enterprises), and modernization 
and strengthening o f tax administration to improve revenue performance (see paras. 103-05). T o help 
address quasi-fiscal deficits and contingent liabilities, the Bank w i l l support lending caps o n the 
nationalized commercial banks to contain their losses and improve their performance and assist t h e 
Government w i t h the i r restructuring and privatization.

Ine f fec t ive and poo r ly managed in f ras t ruc tu re , pa r t icu la r ly powe r a n d ports, has been 
repo r ted as the main constra int to businesses a n d households in Bangladesh. The ma in causes o f 

the poor performance are the institutional and governance structures fo r organizing, managing, and 
financing infrastructure sectors; a distorted p r ic ing framework; and the excessive po l i t ica l 
interference in investment decisions. A l l these limit the much-needed private sector participation in 
these crucial sectors and consequently the resources available t o upgrade them. The W o r l d Bank 
Group and i t s development partners w i l l focus o n imp rov ing sector governance and supporting 
reforms fo r the efficient p rov is ion o f infrastructure services in the pub l ic axid private sectors. P r io r i ty 
w i l l be given t o appropriate and transparent processes fo r identifying, procuring, and managing 
infrastructure projects, essential to attract private sector participation. Specific areas fo r W o r l d Bank

In addition, t h e sector suffers f rom major inefficiencies, and the losses accumulated by state-

Cross-border infrastructure i s not yet firmly planned, but the Bank expects to support t h i s as and 
when i t emerges. O n the po l icy side the Bank’s main objective in the sector i s to improve i t s 
governance and commercial viability; satisfactory implementation o f an appropriate energy p r ic ing 
formula, 
the strengthening o f the Energy Regulatory Commission, and completion and 
implementation o f a financial restructuring plan for the power sector w i l l be pursued in parallel.

In the gas sector further po l icy and regulatory re fo rm i s required for private investment to

and D is t r ibu t ion Company, wh ich controls more than 60 percent o f the gas market, suffers f r om ve ry 
high system losses and poor b i l l collection. The Bank w i l l support the development o f an enabling 
environment fo r the domestic gas sector through po l icy dialogue and policy-based lending. The Bank 
w i l l consider key gas transport investments (pipelines) fo r financing, in coordination w i t h the ADB,

Box 2. Issues in the Power Sector 

In 2005 Bangladesh’s power sector generated 160 lulowatt-hours o f e lec tr ic i ty per capita, among t h e lowest 
levels in t h e wor ld . W h i l e i n s t a l l e d generating capacity i s 5,025 megawatts (MW), secure capacity i s o n l y 
about 3,950 MW. In 2005 load-shedding o f up to 800 M W was necessary o n 287 days, f o r a to ta l o f 1,433 
hours (equivalent to 60 full days). M a j o r industries have responded by sharply expanding captive power 
generation. But the load-shedding bad ly affects growth, especially fo r sma l l and medium-scale indus tr ies 
and others that cannot a f fo rd captive generation. W i t h electricity consumption g row ing an average 8.2 
percent a year in 1994-2005, Bangladesh faces a n expected shor t fa l l o f about 2,500 M W o f generating 
capacity over the nex t five years. The reasons behind t h e shor t fa l l are complex, but one i s apparent 
government interference in procur ing power generation plants. Contracts are subject to frequen t 
retenderings w i thou t bids being awarded, substantially delaying pro jec t implementation. 
Besides the l im i t s in phys ica l infrastructure, the power sector faces c r i t ica l f inanc ia l challenges. M a j o r 
power sector entities are f inanc ia l ly insolvent. The Bangladesh Power Development Boa rd (BPDB) owes 
t h e Government Tk 56 b i l l i o n in debt service l iab i l i t ies . The power sector has poo r accounting practices, 
resu l t ing in delays in finalizing accounts and completing audits, overvaluation o f assets, underestimation o f 
expenses, and inadequate p rov is ion f o r bad debts. Poor governance, reflected in l o w b i l l co l lec t ion rates and 
high system losses (technical and nontechnical), continue to hamper the sector’s development and f inanc ia l 
sustainability . 
In add i t ion to support f o r capacity expansion, development partners have been p rov id ing support to B PD B 
and the Dhaka Electsic Supply Au tho r i ty (DESA) to improve their f inanc ia l management capacity and 
upgrade t h e i r f inanc ia l management systems. T h e Asian Development B a n k has p rov ided support fo r 
corporatizing Ashuganj Power Station, several d is tr ibu t ion companies, and u l t ima te ly B P D B itself. 

47. 

46. 
Imp rov ing national transport and communication systems. The private sector has taken on a 
g row ing ro le in transport, bringing improvements in sector performance. Today state-owned 
transport companies carry less than 5 percent o f passenger t ra f f ic and about 1 percent o f fkeight. T h e 
private sector i s also engaged in road construction and maintenance. Competition i s similarly strong 
in inland water transport, where services are provided ma in ly by small private operators. But 
Bangladesh Railways faces strong competition on ly from the road sector, not f r om private r a i l 
operators. And in the po r t sector private participation i s l im i ted t o cargo services. 
Despite progress in the sector, several issues remain. There are c r i t ica l physical and po l icy 
barriers to passenger and freight flows, and the continuing l ow p roduc t iv i ty o f t h e remaining state- 
mn activities strains the national budget. The Chittagong port, wh ich handles 85 percent o f the 
coun t ry ’s trade, s u f f e r s f r om labor problems, poor management, and lack o f equipment, a l l o f wh ich 
create opportunities fo r c o r r ~ p t i o n . ’ ~ Domestic financing o f road maintenance i s inadequate, and 
regulatory procedures remain complex. A l l t h i s l i m i t s the ab i l i ty o f the nation’s transport system to 
respond to user needs. 
48. 
The W o r l d Bank Group w i l l support the Government’s transport sector strategy, aimed at 
gradually establishing an integrated mu l t imoda l transport system and p romo t ing subregional 
cooperation by developing t rans i t 
links and cross-border facilities. This strategy requires 
strengthening policies and institutions that govern road, rail, inland water, and po r t services to 
improve efficiency and quality. The ultimate objective i s to facilitate private sector participation in 
financing large infrastructure projects and particularly in securing appropriate financing fo r 
maintenance, wh ich has emerged as a serious p rob lem fo r the & m e v iab i l i ty o f the transport sector. 
Through po l icy dialogue and investment projects, t h e W o r l d Bank Group, in cooperation with

sustainability and commercial orientation; and supporting regional cooperation in railways and 
harmonization o f policies, technical standards, and operating procedures t o encourage international 
f re igh t and passenger r a i l traffic. 
Supporting investments in community and small-scale infrastructure 
49. 
T h e Bank, together w i t h Japan and other development partners, w i l l support small-scale 
infrastructure projects that give the poor in rural areas access t o such services as p iped water, farm- 
to-market roads, ru ra l transport, and power. In addition, the Bank w i l l continue to support ru ra l grid 
electrification through the Ru ra l Electrification Board, focusing also on transforming the ru ra l 
electrification cooperative sector, w i t h corporatization o r consolidation as possibilities. Such projects 
w i l l provide power fo r m a l development until the national grid reaches these areas. Special attention 
w i l l be given t o imp rov ing ru ra l livelihoods through small-scale investments supported by a fo l low - 
o n project, the second Social Investment Program Project w i t h the Social Development Fund. Small- 
scale infrastructure projects also w i l l be supported through the program to strengthen loca l 
governance (see paras. 85 -92 ) . 
Leveraging information and communication technology for growth and governance 
50. 
A l though Bangladesh has no t yet seized the opportunity 
to use information and 
communication technology fo r development and governance, the Government’s PRSP recognizes i t s 
ro le in socioeconomic development. With around four phones fo r every hundred people in 
Bangladesh, reliable access to telecommunications and t h e Internet remains limited. G row th in the 
sector has been driven ma in ly by private investments in the mob i le market. Delays in restructuring 
the govexmnent-owned Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Boa rd (BTTB) have continued to 
hamper sector growth. Attracting further investments in the sector w i l l require a stronger regulator 
and a predictable and transparent regulatory framework. 
The W o r l d Bank i s using technical assistance and po l icy dialogue t o support the 
Government’s re fo rm agenda. Policy-based lending (DSCs) w i l l p lay a ro le in the future, most 
immediately to support the corporatization o f the BTTB. A key objective i s t o improve I C T sector 
performance by fully separating t h e po l icy and operational functions in telecommunications, 
imp rov ing the regulatory environment fo r telecommunications, and encouraging development o f 
nationwide broadband infrastructure through public-private partnerships. A second a im i s to use I C T 
in government t o improve service delivery and governance, inc lud ing through e-procurement and 
through e-government initiatives fo r p rov id ing c i t izen services. IFC h a s supported the rap id g row th 
o f mob i le capacity in Bangladesh and w i l l continue to look fo r opportunities to invest in private 
telecommunications and other I C T service providers. MIGA w i l l support foreign investors interested 
in the I C T sector through the p rov is ion o f po l i t ica l risk insurance.

Enhanc ing f inanc ia l in te rmed ia t ion i s essential to support economic g row th and the 

p r iva te sector. The financial sector rema ins shallow, w i t h bank credit t o the private sector j u s t 29 
percent o f GDP and very limited fmancial market penetration. Deep-rooted institutional weaknesses 
hamper the intermediary ro le o f the banking sector: weak management, po l i t ica l interference, and 
directed lending have resulted in a state-owned banking sector w i t h serious performance problems. 
Recent government measures have significantly strengthened the Bangladesh Bank (the central bank) 
and reduced the nonperforming loans o f the four nationalized commercial banks f r om 34 percent to 
25 percent. A relatively free licensing po l icy has permitted the emergence o f 30 private banks and 
reduced t h e NCBs ’ share o f banking assets to 40 percent. And one o f the NCBs, Rupa l i Bank, i s 
being brought to the po in t o f sale. But the financial system i s far f r om meeting the demands o f the 
market. Microfmance institutions serve an estimated 14 m i l l i o n households, w i t h a total asset base o f 
1.4 percent o f GDP. These provide a welcome alternative t o moneylenders, p rov id ing credit to poor 
households and the poss ib i l i ty o f exit f rom poverty. Fo r established enterprises, however, the 
underdeveloped capital market l i m i t s the availability o f longer-term finance. And between these tw o

financed external management teams. Partial or full divestment over t h e medium te rm i s the goal, 
and the Bank may p lay a further ro le in assisting the restructuring and privatization, in cooperation 
w i t h the IMF, through investment projects and policy-based lending. The W o r l d Bank I n s t i t u t e w i l l

w e l l as i t s capacity fo r combating money laundering. As the need and opportunity arise, IFC ando r 
the ADB may p lay a ro le as an investor in some o f t h e privatized NCBs. To support trade promotion 
in Bangladesh, I FC w i l l provide loca l banks w i t h risk coverage that extends and complements the i r 
capacity t o deliver trade fmance t o their clients. In addition, I FC w i l l provide fmancing and technical 
assistance to strengthen private banks and nonbank financial institutions, and w i l l continue to wo rk 
to increase access t o fmance, particularly fo r SMEs, through SEDF’s technical assistance program, 
wh ich includes training fo r partner financial institutions and the Bangladesh Bank. I t has been

Strengthening policies for rural growth 
Strengthen ing policies f o r rural g row th i s k e y in Bangladesh’s land-constra ined 

env ironment . With nearly a l l available agricultural land already under cultivation, future income

people live, w i l l depend almost entirely o n diversification in to high-value agriculture and g row th in 
the rural non fa rm sector. Greater backward and forward linkages and a denser rural-urban continuum 
appear c r i t ica l for creating more and higher-paid employment; contract farming fo r high-value 
agriculture (given land fragmentation and very small farm size), processing o f agricultural 
commodities in to sem i f in ished and finished products, and packaging, storage, and transport t o urban 
and export markets wou ld a l l be part o f the picture. With land a scarce commodity and land

c. PILLAR 2: EMPOWERING THE POOR 
F o r a l l groups in Bang ladesh to benef it f r om h ighe r g row th requ i res empower ing poo r 

people, especially women, through be t te r education, health, and nu t r i t ion and through safe water 
and sanitation and clean living environments. M o r e important, i t requires poor people’s effective 
participation in the country7s governing process through social inclusion and transparent and 
accountable government, inc lud ing at the loca l leve l . 
66. 
Despite Bangladesh’s progress in delivering basic pub l ic services t o the poor, often through 
innovative partnerships w i t h NGOs and loca l communities, the unfinished agenda i s more 
challenging as the country seeks t o improve the quality o f these services wh i le attaining the 
ambitious M i l lenn ium Development Goals i t h a s set i t s e l f . Imp rov ing qua l i ty requires imp rov ing 
institutional accountability and incentive structures, s t i l l very weak in Bangladesh. 

67. 
A k e y reason f o r weak accountab i l ity i s the country’s poo r ly functioning, over ly 
centra l ized bureaucracy , ope ra t ing within a ve ry centra l ized state structure, wh ich 
underm ines the accountab i l ity o f service prov iders to service users. Bangladesh i s regarded as 

one o f the world’s most centralized countries in te rms o f functional and fiscal assignments, po l i t ica l 
decisionmaking, and the l im i ted discretion granted to lower-level organs o f g o v em i e n t in service 
delivery. This centralized structure l i m i t s the ab i l i ty o f citizens to participate in decisions o n loca l 
service priorities, prevents citizens f rom ho ld ing service providers accountable fo r their performance, 
and leads t o higher operational costs fo r delivering basic services to communities. 

68. 
A second reason f o r weak accountab i l ity i s that systematic mechanisms to ensure some 
degree o f commun ity voice and pa r t ic ipa t ion and b r i n g service users closer to service prov iders 

a re la rge ly missing. NGOs and community-based providers, however, have been effective in 
amplifymg the voice o f the poo r and creating parallel channels o f service delivery. 
Strengthening accountability fo r better services i s made even more d i f f icu l t by the 
deteriorating quality o f the c i v i l service and t h e inab i l i ty o f the existing deconcentrated system to 
formulate policy, fo l low up o n implementation, and monitor outputs and performance. 

69 . 

70. 
F u r t h e r improvements in the qua l i ty o f service de l ivery will n o t b e possible w i thou t 
improvements in loca l governance structures. The recent move t o strengthen lower-level loca l 

governments deserves attention as a promising avenue-not 
on ly fo r imp rov ing t h e accountability 
framework fo r service delivery but ultimately fo r a potential d i f fus ion o f po l i t ica l power that may 
build effective checks and balances in Bangladesh’s governing process.

Improving service delivery in health 
72. 
Desp ite Bangladesh’s progress t ow a r d hea lth-re lated MDGs, challenges in the hea l th 

sector r em a i n enormous. In c h i l d malnutrition and maternal mo r ta l i ty Bangladesh i s a “good 
performer” compared w i t h India o r Pakistan, but the region as a whole ranks among the weakest in 
the world. Wh i le po l io has been eradicated in Bangladesh, tuberculosis remains problematic. T h e 
gap in health conditions between r i c h and poor r em a i n s large, w i t h children in the poorest 
households, fo r example, tw ice as likely t o be moderately malnourished and four times as likely to 
be severely malnourished as children in the richest households. Finding cost-effective ways o f 
delivering essential health services to the poor i s critical. 

73. 

T h e Gove rnmen t i s on ly pa r t ia l ly p repa red to respond to these c r i t ica l challenges. 

Public health service providers depend entirely on a centralized m i n i s t r y in Dhaka fo r their career 
development, and there i s no accountability t o service users. Absenteeism i s rampant (almost 45 
percent according to a W o r l d Bank study, s im i l a r to rates found in Ind ia and Pakistan). Fac i l i ty 
managers lack professionalism and independence in decision-making. Support services such as drug 
supply are managed by a centralized bureaucracy that has l i t t l e interface w i t h service users . And 
overlapping h c t i o n s and lack o f coordination in the health administration result in the deterioration 
o f services.

Improving sewice delivery in primary and secondary education 
76. 
W h i l e Bang ladesh has made impressive gains in access to education, especially 
p r i m a r y education, quality rema ins a d i f f icu l t challenge. T h e gross enrollment ra t io i s about 97 

percent at the primary level, but on ly 43.7 percent at the secondary leve l and even lower at the 
college and university leve l . T h e quality h a s deteriorated at a l l levels, leading to a substantial waste 
o f resources through l ow pass rates. I t i s estimated that on ly about 5 percent o f primary school 
entrants pass the primary school examination at grade 5, the end o f the primary school cycle. 
Several factors account fo r the problems in quality, inc lud ing poor teaching quality, high 
student-teacher ratios, high teacher absenteeism, 
lack o f adequate learning materials, and 
overcrowded classrooms, often operating in two s h i f t s . Above all, weak management and 
supervision impede efforts t o improve quality. The primary education system remains highly 
centralized, and school management committees and parent-teacher associations have no t yet 
become effective. Management also remains weak at the secondary level, particularly in the 
nongovernment institutions that make up the ma jo r i ty o f secondary schools. 

77 . 

78 . 

T h e PRSP emphasizes the impo r tance o f education a n d lea rn ing f o r pove r ty reduction. 

I t also emphasizes t h e significant improvements needed in quality and in access by the very poor. 
Among i t s objectives are to make available early childhood development and preschool, no t 
currently part o f pub l ic ly provided education; ensure 100 percent completion in primary education; 
extend education coverage; support modernization o f and quality improvements in madrassah 
curricula and effectively implement quality standards; and expand secondary education by imp rov ing 
access and increasing i t s relevance t o the needs o f society. T h e PRSP also proposes actions t o 
improve t h e effectiveness and reduce t h e po l i t ic iza t ion o f technical and vocational education and 
higher education. 

79. 

T h e W o r l d Bank’s support f o r educat ion r e f o rm i s strongly focused on imp rov ing 

sector governance a n d accountability. In primary education t h e W o r l d Bank i s part o f an ADB - led 
donor group that, through the Primary Education Development Project 11, supports the Ministry o f 
Primary and Mass Education’s six-year program t o expand access to education and strengthen i t s 
quality and effectiveness. In secondary education the Bank i s supporting improvements championed 
by the M in is t ry o f Education through dialogue and a series o f policy-based loans. The objectives are 
to increase the accountability o f secondary schools to government and to the c o m u n i t y by linking 
school subsidies to objective criteria and measures o f school performance; build capacity in t h e 
m in is t ry to monitor performance through expenditure tracking surveys and program evaluation and 
mon i to r ing so as to gu ide policy; improve teacher quality by establishing an independent teacher 
accreditation authority t o ce r t i fy eligible applicants; and enhance transparency in textbook 
production through privatization. The Bank plans t o fo l low up in these areas w i t h a sectorwide 
program o n secondary education, which, as noted, w i l l include support fo r the vocational education 
and training programs. In addition, IFC w i l l explore opportunities to support inves tmen ts in 
education projects sponsored by the private sector, including universities. 
Improving water and sanitation 
80. 
Bangladesh has made good progress in imp rov ing access to safe wa te r , mov ing t ow a r d 

the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopment Goals. T h e country s tands out in the developing w o r l d fo r having 
access to pathogen-free drinking water sources in some 97 percent o f i t s villages, thanks t o earlier 

25 

govemment programs partnering w i t h NGOs. But the recent discovery o f arsenic contamination in 
some aquifers indicates that t h i s impressive achievement i s at risk. Arsenic contamination o f 
groundwater has affected an estimated 25 percent o f the shallow tube-wells in ru ra l areas, reducing 
safe water coverage to around 76 percent o f the ru ra l population. In urban areas deterioration in so l id 
waste management similarly poses a serious problem fo r water quality. Lack o f access to safe 
drinking water in bo th ru ra l and urban areas, particularly fo r the poor, has thus become a major 
emerging i s s u e in water and sanitation services. Others are institutional inefficiency due to lack o f 
clarity o n the roles and responsibilities o f government and the service p rov id ing agencies; 
inequitable service distribution; financing and cost recovery; and poor sector coordination. 

81. 

The W o r l d Bank will continue to help address r u r a l water supply delivery through the 

Bangladesh Wa te r Supply Program Project. T h i s project focuses no t on ly o n increasing access to 
safe water but also o n developing an innovative service delivery mechanism by invo lv ing NGOs and 
p r i v a t i entities in ru ra l piped water supply schemes. In addition, the project i s p i lo t ing a new 
approach t o pourashava water supply. On ly about half o f a l l pourashavas have p iped water supply 
systems, leaving the rest to supply their urban population through private hand pumps. Other 
development partners also are developing municipal water supply projects. E f fo r ts by the W o r l d 
Bank and i t s development partners in water supply and sanitation are geared toward supporting the 
Government’s agenda o f strengthening decentralized service delivery and empowering lower-tier 
levels o f govenunent. By putting service delivery in the hands o f communities, un ion parishads, and 
pourashavas, 
the Government 
i s effectively shifting decisionmaking, 
responsibility, and 
accountability fo r investments to these levels, increasing transparency and incentives to improve 
service delivery and expanding options f o r scaling up. 

82. 
The ma jo r emerging issues in u rban water and sanitation will be addressed during the 
CAS period through a variety of approaches. These w i l l include p r o g r a m to increase the quality 
and quantity o f water resources around Dhaka; improve the water supply, sanitation, and drainage 
systems in Dhaka and Chittagong; improve so l id waste collection in selected towns; develop a model 
to provide carbon finance support fo r urban solid waste management; and support conditions fo r 
private sector investment in so l id waste management in selected towns.

Improve the Effectiveness o f Safety Ne ts 

83. 
The large number of poor people and the depth o f poverty in Bangladesh call for 
exploring how to mitigate poverty and vulnerability through safety ne t systems. Bangladesh h a s 

a range o f formal and in fo rma l instruments to mitigate and cope w i t h poverty, but on ly about 8 
percent (4-5 m i l l ion ) o f i t s 63 m i l l i o n poor people receive some f o rm o f social assistance. The 
country’s patchwork of sa fe ty net p rog ram , a l l w i t h large administrative ove rheads -cash transfers 
and food and in-kind safety nets-target 
different r isk groups, from the disadvantaged t o t h e elderly 
poor. Consistent w i t h Bangladesh’s l o w income level, however, these programs are l im i ted in scale 
and coverage. Coupled w i t h inefficiencies, their l im i ted size means that these programs are no t 
adequate f o r addressing poverty or m i t iga t ing vulnerability t o poverty. Moreover, the programs are 
administered by a number o f ministries, w i t h gaps, overlaps, and inadequate coordination. And the 
country’s pension system i s l i k e l y t o face fiscal constraints as the base pay and the average age o f the 
workforce rise.21 
84. 
There i s a need fo r short- and long-term safety nets, and community-based approaches o f fe r 
special attractions. These w i l l require an integrated approach, rationalizing programs and developing 
un i fo rm targeting mechanisms. One such mechanism i s p roxy means testing, wh ich scores

ownership o f durable goods, and the education and l ive l ihood o f household members-to de tem ine 

In recent years t h e Government h a s introduced a pay-as-you-go, means-tested old age payment scheme that supports more than a million 
beneficiaries. T h e scheme seems t o be well targeted but because o f limits on the number o f beneficiaries, many who qualify a re excluded.

E f fo r ts to build accountab i l ity and imp rove service de l ivery a re un l ike ly to succeed 
w i thou t significant 
improvements in loca l governance. These wou ld en ta i l c la r i fy ing 

intergovernmental relationships wh i le strengthening the institutions o f community accountability to 
a l low citizen voice and participation in development decisions and building the capacity o f loca l 
government structures to ensure the p rov is ion o f basic loca l services. 
Rather than a formal t ie r o f government, Bangladesh’s loca l government structures at the 
district leve l (upazilas) are l i t t l e more than the s u m o f ind iv idua l central l i n e ministries and other 
service delivery structures. The lowe r elected leve ls o f government (union parishads and 
pourashavas) have l im i ted resources and l i t t l e authority to raise revenues and are dominated by 
h i g h e r t ie rs . M o r e important, there i s a continued lack o f clarity in the assignment o f po l i t ica l and 
administrative accountability in loca l governance and service provision. Loca l governments also 
have no meaningful financial accountability: they have very limited financial and budget authority 
and are no t audited regularly or comprehensively. 
The centralized arrangements o f governance restrict the formal avenues fo r community 
participation in loca l decisionmaking and fo r citizen oversight o f loca l service delivery systems. 
There are also l im i ted opportunities fo r participation in and oversight o f loca l government activities. 
Seats are reserved fo r women in loca l government bodies, but female members are elected f r om a 
larger constituency than male members and do no t have a clear mandate and role. Wh i le the mere 
election o f women may not in i t s e l f improve governance, i t does allow fo r enhanced voice and 
participation o f a group formerly l e f t out o f decision-making structures. 
Operational accountability fo r loca l service delivery i s undermined no t on ly by unclear 
allocation o f responsibility between leve ls o f government. I t i s also unde-ed 
by unclear d iv is ion 
o f roles between elected loca l policymakers and service providers. T h i s leads to extensive po l i t ica l 
interference and the fragmentation o f responsibilities fo r actual delivery o f services across agencies 
outside a clear contracting framework. Loca l government structures have l i t t l e strategic and technical 
capacity to ensure the delivery o f basic loca l infrastructure and services, further undermining their 
accountability to communities. 
T h e Government’s PRSP focuses o n expanding the scope fo r pro-poor economic g row th by 
expanding income and employment opportunities fo r the poor and supporting participatory 
governance by strengthening accountable and inclusive institutions o f loca l governance. T h e 
Government and development partners agreed at 
the recent Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Implementation Forum to take concrete steps t o strengthen loca l governance, inc lud ing by ensuring 
that reasonable untied resources are available at the loca l l e v e l to respond to community priorities.

T h e W o r l d Bank’s strategy w i l l focus on strengthening the accountab i l ity o f the lowest 
t iers o f government to the citizens who elect t h em by inst itut iona l iz ing the in te r face between

so that they can ho ld loca l governments accountable fo r their performance, and enhancing the 
techn ica l capacity bo th o f loca l governments t o ensure the delivery o f basic loca l services and o f

On the basis o f t h i s strategy, the W o r l d Bank w i l l w o r k w i t h development partners to

partners are w e l l placed to assist the Government in taking practical steps t o redefine the assignment 
o f accountabilities for service delivery, to strengthen t h e technical capacity o f loca l governments and 
service delivery agencies to provide services, and to support communities in engaging loca l 
government structures t o enhance the i r accountability. The potential fo r using fu tu re initiatives in 
different sectors to support the strengthening o f local governance also w i l l be explored.

communities in making fo rma l structures o f loca l government more accountable (as described in the 
previous section) but also initiatives t o support communities directly. The design o f selected projects 
throughout the po r t fo l io w i l l also reflect t h i s approach o f using community participation t o s h i f t and 
institutionalize the responsibility fo r delivering and monitoring services f rom an external party such 
as the Bank t o the beneficiaries (examples include community fisheries, ru ra l water and sanitation, 
and education, health, and social protection).

Bangladesh i s w e l l k n ow n fo r i t s success in using NGOs and other forms o f community

leve l n&es 
i t d i f f icu l t fo r citizens at the grassroots to ensure that their development priorities are 
reflected in national policies and plans. Poverty and social assessment studies show that many 
nationally implemented poverty reduction programs (for example, microcredit and safety net 
programs such as food fo r w o r k and development programs fo r vulnerable groups) have achieved 
l i t t l e sustained success in reducing poverty among the poorest and most vulnerable. The Social 
Development Foundation, established by the Government as a nonp ro f i t organization in 200 1, i s 
designed to promote and institutionalize community-driven development initiatives.22

Social Investment Program Project w i l l therefore use the C D D approach more comprehensively, 
focusing o n strengthening village institutions, imp rov ing the livelihoods o f marginalized and 
vulnerable people, and building t r u s t and accountability between community groups and loca l

give voice t o poor women and the most marginalized. These initiatives, along w i t h the direct funding 
to communities, w i l l ensure decentralized management o f development programs at the village leve l 
and enable poor people to expand the i r role in loca l governance. 

D. CORE GOVERNANCE 

97 . 

M u c h o f the agenda addressed in the two pillars i s about imp rov ing sector governance. 
Imp rov ing t h e investment climate involves, fo r example, strengthening the regulatory environment 
fo r industry and finance and removing governance impediments to inves tmen ts in infrastructure. 
Similarly, empowering the poor involves making government more accountable fo r service delivery 
o r infrastructure provision and strengthening loca l governance to bring government closer to the 
people. The Bank, through i t s various i n s t r um e n t s and in collaboration w i t h development partners, 
w i l l attempt t o strengthen key institutions responsible fo r ensuring good governance under these two 
pillars. I t w i l l also attempt to strengthen demand fo r good governance by encouraging pub l ic 
participation in policymaking and po l icy and program mon i to r ing across different leve ls o f 
government. This agenda w i l l be advanced through a l l Bank activities in Bangladesh, inc lud ing 
analytical and advisory activities (AAA), projects, and strategic partnerships w i t h the private sector, 
academia, and c i v i l society. This mainstreamed approach means that Bank operations, whatever the 
sector, w i l l b e as much about governance as they w i l l be about infi-astructure provision o r service 
delivery. 

98 . 

But the re a r e c lear l i m i t s to the gains f r o m imp roved sector governance w i thou t 
correspond ing imp rovemen t in k e y core governance functions. Development outcomes depend as 
much o n addressing a set of governance issues that cut across a l l sectors as they do o n imp rov ing 
governance at the sector leve l . U n l e s s revenue administration i s improved, the Government’s 
revenues w i l l no t increase as projected in i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy to fund pro-poor 
expenditures. As noted, the l o w revenue effort also prevents the Government f r om pay ing c i v i l 
servants a living wage and allocating adequate resources fo r operations and maintenance, creating 
huge incentives for corruption and poor service delivery. Similarly, a failure t o address weaknesses 
in pub l ic financial management sys tems erodes the effectiveness o f the rather modest resources 
Bangladesh deploys through pub l ic expenditures (some 13.3 percent o f 2004 GDP) t o fight poverty, 
by encouraging waste and corruption. Equally important i s the need fo r be t te r oversight and 
transparency and improvements in the way pub l ic administration i s managed so as to ensure an 
efficient, clean, and accountable c i v i l service. 

99 . 
Strengthen ing k e y institutions o f accountability-including 
the lega l a n d j u d i c i a l 
sector, wh ich prov ides a check on the execut ive-w i l l also he lp res t ra in abuse o f office and 

reduce the risk o f corrupt ion . Re fo rm o f the justice sector-the 
courts, pub l ic prosecutors, and the 
police-will 
be crucial in imp rov ing the investment climate, by p rov id ing predictability in the 
enforcement o f contracts, supplying the means to se t t le disputes in an orderly and t ime ly fashion, and 
maintaining l aw and order. Such re fo rm i s equally important to ensure access to justice fo r t h e poo r 
and t o protect the poor, especially women, and the weak f r om human r i g h t s abuse and other 
violations o f their personal dignity. Finally, success in imp rov ing the investment climate and 
imp rov ing service delivery w i l l depend o n whether citizens and investors can h o l d government

accountable fo r t h e services i t provides. As stated in the PRSP, “freeing up in fo rma t ion i tse l f can act 
as a p o w e r l l driver for building accountability pressures and imp rov ing the governance 
The Bank, together w i th i t s development partners, w i l l help the Government o f Bangladesh 
address these core governance issues. Reforms in these areas w i l l take considerable time to have an 
impact. But t h e Bank w i l l support some clear, measurable steps, explicit and im p l i c i t in the PRSP, 
that w i l l send a strong signal o n the direction o f change and create a momentum for further 
governance reforms in pub l ic financial management and procurement and the legal and jud ic ia l 
sector (table 5) . 

1. Imp rove Pub l ic F inanc ia l Management and Procurement 

101. Bangladesh has developed a reasonable t rack record in managing i t s fiscal balances. 

The overall fiscal deficit has been steadily reduced, w i t h the FY04 leve l o f 3.2 percent o f GDP 
representing a b i g improvement o n the peak o f 5 percent in FYOO and FYOl . With revenue efforts at 
a l o w 10 percent o f GDP, the decline in the fiscal deficit p r ima r i ly reflects a s u c c e s s l l containment 
o f pub l ic expenditures, particularly o n the annual development plan. The decline in the fiscal deficit 
has been accompanied by a secular decline in concessional foreign financing over the years, f rom 4.8 
percent o f GDP in FY90 to 1.1 percent in FY04; i t has also permitted a substantial reduction in net 
domestic financing, particularly bank financing, wh ich f e l l f rom 1.6 percent o f GDP t o 0.4 percent in 

FY04. 

102. Without a strategic budget planning process, however, t h i s strong performance in 
maintaining aggregate fiscal discipline h a s come at the cost o f undermining the effectiveness and 
efficiency o f pub l ic expenditure. Expenditure reductions have often been ad hoc and arbitrary, driven 
by unforeseen revenue shortages and by the poor ab i l i ty o f the pub l ic expenditure management 
systems t o properly manage such adjustments. Heav i ly populated countries tend to have less 
government spending as a share o f GDP, reflecting economies o f scale in lowe r per capita costs o f 
p rov id ing services. But coverage o f pub l ic services in Bangladesh i s l ow in many areas, and despite 
the relatively modest size o f the c i v i l service, the wage b i l l (broadly defined to include subventions) 
tends to c rowd out other expenditures, such as operations and maintenance and other nonwage pub l ic 
spending. 
Modernizing the National Board of Revenue 
103. 
The revenue effort o f Bangladesh has been weak and, for the past several years, 
stagnating. With a population o f 140 m i l l ion , t h e country has on ly 1.4 m i l l ion registered income tax 
payers and 300,000 businesses registered fo r the value added tax (VAT). To ta l tax revenue amounts 
to 7.4 percent o f GDP. T h i s l o w leve l reflects in part the l ow elasticity o f revenues w i t h respect to 
income growth due t o a heavy dependence o n impo r t taxes (27 percent of to ta l tax collections) and 
numerous exemptions, tax holidays, and preferences. I t i s also due in part to poor tax administration. 
The revenue authority and customs have a reputation fo r corruption, re f lec t ing the lack o f 
accountability and weak incentives characterizing the rest o f the c i v i l service (see para. 113). Wh i le 
some progress was made in customs, taxpayers s t i l l face cumbersome processes, such as a large 
number o f approvals required fo r customs clearance, and n ~ y
opportunities fo r face-to-face contact 
with revenue officials, wh ich lead to the extraction of rents.24 The management structure i s weak, 
reflecting a lack o f clear organizational direction and leadership. I t also reflects an organizational 
structure based on type o f tax, wh ich tends to duplicate functions (such as audits and collection) and 
undermine the exchange o f information. M o r e important, t h i s structure i s inconvenient and 
burdensome fo r taxpayers, who must deal w i t h different u n i t s o n s i m i l a r issues.

Government has taken measures to improve tax collection in the short term by establishing Large 
Taxpayer U n i t s fo r Income Tax and VAT . I t has recently approved a strategic development plan 
aimed at increasing revenue collection, developing a more effective organizational structure along 
functional lines, developing legal and regulatory systems to facilitate rather than hamper trade flows, 
fostering a culture o f taxpayer service, and ensuring that a l l businesses are treated un i fo rm ly and 
equitably. The initial stages o f the plan have been supported by a DFID grant and IDA, through t h e 
Economic Management Technical Assistance Project. The plan w i l l also be supported through 
policy-based lending (DSCs) and IMF programs. A fully fledged tax administration modernization 
project i s also be ing planned.

Strengthening public financial management and accountability 
106. 
The Wo r ld Bank’s recent Review of 
Institutional Arrangements for Public Expenditure, 
Financial Management and Procurement revealed that Bangladesh’s public expenditure 
institutions need to be significantly strengthened Key links in the chain o f pub l ic financial 

accountability are weak. One o f the most serious weaknesses i s the lack o f a strategic planning 
process, reflected in the overprogramming o f the annual development plan. T h i s lack facilitates 
discretionary behavior, creates opportunities fo r rent seeking, and leads to too many underfunded 
projects, delays in implementation, and chronic underexpenditure. Budget planning i s fiagmented 
between revenue (recurrent) and development (investment) budgets and preoccupied w i t h the inputs 
rather than outputs and outcomes, undermining any performance orientation. Moreover, weaknesses 
in budget execution related to accounting, reconciliation w i t h the Bank, and reporting delays hinder 
transparency and create opportunities 
fo r mismanagement o f pub l ic funds. Failure to use 
international accounting standards in state-owned enterprises conceals the real value o f contingent 
l iab i l i t ies in t h e budget. Internal and external controls remain weak, as reflected in the lack o f 
accounting information in l i n e ministries, delays in the publication o f audited reports, unsatisfactory 
quality o f the external audits function, and ineffective parliamentary oversight o f the entire budget 
process. 
107. 
The Government has begun to address these weaknesses systematically as p a r t o f a 
p rog ram o f reforms supported by the DFID, W o r l d Bank, and IMF. The PRSP calls fo r 

strengthening planning processes to avoid overprogramming, inc lud ing through better project 
preparation and approval processes. The Government h a s taken so l id s teps toward introducing a 
Med ium -Te rm Budgetary Framework, p i l o t i n g i t in four ministries in FY 0 6 and planning t o extend i t 
to six additional m i n i s t r i e s in FY07. Expenditure tracking surveys are being carried out in three 
ministries to study the extent to wh ich the amounts allocated in budgets reach the spending 
authorities and beneficiaries. The Government has also ro l led out a custom computerized accounting 
system to 20 o f 5 8 district accounts offices and 7 o f 49 ch ie f accounts offices. Wh i le the introduction 
o f t h i s system was no t preceded by a redesign o f business processes, i t has considerably increased 
the speed with wh ich accounts are generated and allowed the Government to produce mon th ly fiscal 
reports. In addition, the Government has eliminated a ma jo r conflict o f interest by separating the 
external audit and internal accounting functions. I t now needs to make the Comptroller and Aud i to r 
General a truly independent body, w i t h n o reliance on the Government fo r i t s budgetary allocations 
and administrative decisions. The Public Accounts Committee o f Parliament, reestablished w i t h IDA 
support in DSC II, has begun t o reduce t h e backlog o f audited accounts fo r discussion, and i t s 
deliberations are beginning to be fo l lowed by the press in Dhaka. 

108. Progress in improv ing the qua l ity o f public financial management and accountability 
w i l l be crucial fo r Bangladesh to meet the goals set out in i t s PRSP. The PRSP sees such progress 

as a c r i t ica l element in i t s anticorruption agenda. The Bank i s wo rk ing w i t h the Government to 
develop a detailed action plan fo r raising many o f the C ratings i t has received on Pub l ic Financial 
Management (PFM) indicators to B ratings by the end o f the CAS period (see attachment 4). The 
focus w i l l be especially on imp rov ing performance o n the indicators w i t h a direct bearing o n 
transparency, financial accountability, and performance. These include indicators relating t o 
comprehensiveness and transparency o f the budget, such as p rov is ion o f in fo rma t ion o n budgetary 
allocations and p e r f o m c e standards t o enable project and program beneficiaries t o mon i to r the 
delivery o f resources and services; the effectiveness o f internal control and audit functions; pay ro l l 
controls; improvement in the qua l i ty and relevance o f external audit reports; systematic fo l low -up o f 
key audit fmdings; and enforcement o f pub l ic sector ethics codes and asset declarations.

aimed at imp rov ing P F M ratings w i l l be a key ind ica tor i n j u d g i n g the appropriateness of 
the use of 
Development Policy Cred i ts as an instrument in the Bank’s program. The Bank w i l l wo rk with i t s 
development partners to assist the Government in meeting the P F M standards. A Public Expenditure

PRSP in to the budget through the Medium-Term Budgetary Framework and fo r f ina l iz ing the system 
requirements o f an Integrated Financial Management In fo rma t ion System. And potential project 
investments in Treasury computerization are being explored. Finally, the W o r l d Bank I n s t i t u t e w i l l 
provide targeted training interventions o n fiscal sustainability analysis and debt management fo r the 
Ministry o f Finance and support t o the Ministry o f Planning in poverty data analysis and MDG 
monitoring to better align with the PRSP goals and indicators. 
Achieving transparent and competitive procurement 
110. 
Pub l ic p rocu remen t i s a k e y source o f co r rup t ion in many countries, and Bangladesh 
has been no exception. Before reforms in recent years, procurement was subject t o considerable 
delays, lacked transparency, was poo r ly managed, and was seen as t h e s ing le most important source 
o f leakage o f pub l ic funds. But the Government h a s made good progress through these in i t ia l 
reforms. Fo r t h e f i r s t t ime i t issued un i fo rm procurement regulations that apply to a l l public sector 
entities across the country, consistent w i t h international procurement practices. I t has introduced new 
standard bidding documents and significantly reduced the layers in the procurement approval 
processes. I t has put in to place a unique procurement tracking and mon i to r ing system through an 
integrated management in fo rma t ion system (MIS) now being p i lo ted in a few agencies. The 
Government i s committed t o p lac ing soon before Parliament fo r enactment a new procurement law 
satisfactory t o IDA, wh ich covers infrastructure concessions and build-operate-transfer arrangements 
(BOTS). This progress has enabled Bangladesh t o secure B ratings in three o f the four P F M 
indicators o n procurement. Further progress cannot be taken fo r ganted, however, since there i s 
considerable resistance to these reforms f r om powe r fu l vested interests. 

11 1. 

T h e B a n k will, therefore, support a deepening o f these i n i t i a l p rocu remen t reforms, 

including through policy-based lending @SCs) and a second Procurement Re fo rm Project that w i l l 
support implementation o f the new law once i t has been passed by Parliament. T h e project w i l l also 
support an e-procurement system aimed at enhancing transparency and efficiency fo r bo th 
government and bidders. An e-procurement readiness survey w i l l be launched shortly to help prepare 
an implementation program. 
112. K e y to successful implementation o f a satisfactory new procurement law and full realization 
o f i ts intent w i l l be strong compliance monitoring, not just by the Central Procurement Technical 
Unit but also by c i v i l society and NGOs through procurement watch activities. T h e approach to

mechanisms to better manage complaints f rom bidders, c i v i l society, o r beneficiaries; extension o f 
the MIS beyond t h e p i l o t agencies t o the entire government; and systematic publication and tracking

contractors, suppliers, and consultants, w i l l be crucial to explain the new regulations and encourage

training in managing government procurement and encouraging behavioral change and social

Reforming pub l ic administration 
113. An unde rpe r fo rm ing , ineff ic ient , a n d weak c iv i l service rema ins a constra int on service 
de l ivery a n d imp lemen ta t ion o f reforms. Numerous commissions and reviews have been 

undertaken, and a fa i r ly comprehensive agenda awaits implementation. Yet progress has been slow. 
As a 1996 W o r l d Bank report states, 

33 

E v e n so, a numbe r o f pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion re fo rms have been imp lemen ted in recent 

there are many individuals in the C i v i l Service who are highly competent, but cannot 
render their best because o f the Government’s compensation policies, wo rk ing 
environment, restrictive cadre practices and i t s practice o f deploying the available 
personnel without trying to match t h e i r s k i l l s t o the requirements o f the job . The pay 
i s too flat, w i t h severe below ma rke t salaries at the top and above market salaries at 
the bottom, scarcity o f s k i l l s at the top, and redundant staff at the bottom. Any 
re fo rm o f the c i v i l service h a s to address these anomalies?6 
114. Several factors explain the lack o f po l i t ica l w i l l to address these issues. The unhealthy 
competition between the major po l i t ica l pa r t ies leads to a highly po l i t ic ized c i v i l service and means 
that reforms are unsustainable when power s h i f t s from one party to the other. T h e systemic 
corruption i s self-reinforcing, even to the po in t where po l i t ica l parties become partly dependent on 
fiinding f r om routine corruption in the c i v i l service. Moreover, there are p o w e f i l internal vested 
interests: t h e cadre system creates vertical stovepipes o f competing interests that distort departmental 
and ministerial structures and restrict staff movements. Class 4 employees, at the bo t tom o f the rung, 
are a powe r fu l po l i t ica l lobby strongly res is tan t to more ambitious reforms.

years. The size o f t h e pub l ic service and the g row th o f the wage b i l l have been successfully 
contained. A Career Planning Wing was created in the Ministry o f Establishment t o focus o n career 
planning and effective deployment o f class 1 officers. A training po l icy h a s been issued, and t ra in ing 
i s now one o f t h e criteria fo r promotion o f officers. There i s greater emphasis o n me r i t in p romo t ion 
and career development. And the Government i s considering the reestablishment o f a senior c i v i l 
service o r management pool?’ These gains are laudable, though much more needs t o be done t o 
improve the c i v i l service. I t wou ld nevertheless be unwise to expect much in the way o f c i v i l service 
re fo rm until the forthcoming elections are over.

im p o r t a n t steps. The PRSP calls fo r imp rov ing incentives, motivation, and capacity within the 
administration, particularly through a strengthened process o f recruitment (including f r om outside 
the administration fo r senior-level positions), a stronger system o f rewards and punishment, and 
oversight and mon i to r ing mechanisms. Through i t s analytical and advisory services, the Bank w i l l 
wo rk w i t h the Government to improve the caliber, effectiveness, and efficiency o f the c i v i l service. 
The Bank w i l l help establish a senior c i v i l service.” W h i l e developing such a senior service may 
take time, in the in te r im the Bank w i l l undertake preparatory wo rk w i t h the Government and i t s 
partners and help strengthen the Government’s personnel management system, inc lud ing through 
merit- and performance-based promotions, improved postings and trans fers , revised compensation, 
and enhanced training. In addition, the Bank w i l l help the Government manage i t s wage b i l l through 
analytical w o r k to review c i v i l service pay and compensation po l icy .

3. Support L e g a l a n d Jud ic ia l R e f o rm 

11 8. An effective lega l a n d jud ic ia l system i s c r i t ica l no t on ly to create effective checks and 
balances but also to he lp enforce contracts a n d settle disputes. Bangladesh’s justice sector suffers 

f r om many o f the weaknesses common in developing countries. W h i l e the Constitution and laws are 
generally sound, the justice system i s seen as corrupt and subject t o excessive delays. There i s no 
code o f conduct governing the judiciary, and court staff allegedly indulge actively in rent seeking. 
The h ighe r courts pe r fo rm better, however, and the Supreme Court has remained a relative island o f 
integrity, showing i t s willingness t o stand up to governments. The delays in the justice system 
seriously compromise i t s ab i l i ty t o enforce contracts and property r i g h t s : resolving a c i v i l case takes 
five years o n average, f r om filing to the decision o f a district court. These delays lead to a huge 
backlog o f pending cases. Among other things, t h e delays reflect a lack o f modem case management, 
weak court administration, and deliberate delays by litigants, tolerated by cooperative judges, t o 
avoid resolution when their cases are weak. The system often lacks transparency and accountability 
and encourages impunity. Access t o justice fo r women i s particularly weak and there i s a growing 
perception that violence against women i s on the r i s e . 
119. The police are also at the hear t o f the poor administration o f justice. They have been 
described as a reactive force w i t h a philosophy o f public control rather than community service. T h e 
police are seen by average Bangladeshis as corrupt and brutal and are a source o f internal and 
external concern about human rights abuses. They are also one reason fo r the deterioration in law 
and order that has contributed t o the weak investment climate. 

120. 

T h e Gove rnmen t has made f o rm a l commitments to r e f o rm i t s lega l a n d jud ic ia l 

system. In 2000 the Government developed a long-term strategy fo r legal and jud ic ia l capacity 
building that has guided the Bank’s i n i t i a l support to the justice sector. The PRSP identifies criminal 
justice re fo rm and affordable justice fo r the poor as high priorities. In addition, the Government 
commits i t s e l f in t h e PRSP t o “meaningful progress o n the separation o f the jud ic ia ry f r om the 
executive” to implement a Supreme Court judgment o f 200 1, wh ich calls fo r such a separation in l i n e 
w i t h the Constitution o f Bangladesh. T h i s separation requires removing the jud ic ia l functions o f 
loca l magistrates, who now cany out b o t h executive and jud ic ia l functions, and developing a cadre 
o f judges to take o n these jud ic ia l functions.29 With support f r om the Bank, the Government has 
initiated a p i lo t program t o increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability o f the c i v i l 
justice system and to increase access t o justice fo r the poor.30 Elements o f the re fo rm include 

29 Separation o f t h e executive and judiciary i s not an issue for t h e higher courts or lower courts, both o f which are administratively under 
the Supreme Court, not t h e executive branch. By contrast, t h e local magistrates, who carry judicial as well as executive responsibilities, 
report to t h e executive branch. I t i s estimated that some 600 judges need to be identified, hired, and trained to replace t h e current 
magistracy, a task that w i l l t a k e some time. A jud ic ia l service commission was recently established as a first step. 
30 A $30.6 m i l l i o n Legal and Judicial Capacity Building Project financed by I D A was approved by the Board on March 29, 2001. 
Amendments to t h e C iv i l Procedure Code relating to court-facilitated mediation and others aimed at reducing delays in case processing by 
imposing sanctions for dilatory tactics and modernizing and expediting se rv ice o f summons have done much to help reduce the number of 
cases going to trial and shorten case processing times. A limited computer management system intmduced in t h e pilot courts has helped to 
increase transparency and improve court administration. T h e project also supported implementation o f t h e New Money Loan Court Act 
2003, which has vastly improved loan recovery mechanism by providing for summaty procedures, empowering banks to sell the co l la ted 
o f defaulters in public auctions, and e m p o w e g courts to enforce judgments. T h e Canadian International Development Agency i s

strengthening court administration and reducing delays by imp rov ing case management through an 
automated management information system, strengthening jud ic ia l training, and upgrading facilities 
and other human resource needs in five p i lo t districts and the Supreme Court. The Government also 
aims t o improve access to justice through a new ly institutionalized alternative dispute resolution 
mechanism, wh ich allows quicker resolution o f cases outside the courts by imp rov ing access to legal 
a i d and p romo t ing legal literacy and public awareness at t h e grassroots level. A m id te rm review o f 
t h i s project i s under way and w i l l be used to help evaluate ways o f making faster progress in jud ic ia l 
reform. 
121. G iven the lack o f public demand fo r reforms, however, progress o n t h i s front w i l l prove 
d i f f icu l t . W h i l e p i l o t re fo rm programs t o improve jud ic ia l administration a r e important i n i t i a l steps, 
they are no t enough t o address the weak incentive structure at the roo t o f many d y s h c t i o n a l i t i e s o f 
the justice system. The ru le o f law i s not in the interests o f clientelist politics because i t reduces the 
need fo r clients t o seek the help o f patrons in resolving disputes o r enforcing contracts. The Bank, 
w i t h i t s development partners-particularly 
the Canadian International Development Agency, 
Danida, and the European Community-will wo rk on ways t o strengthen the demand fo r legal and 
jud ic ia l reforms and help build a broad national consensus o n the need for such reforms and o n 
priorities fo r justice sector reforms. This effort w i l l center on encouraging and facilitating a dialogue 
w i t h i n the justice sector and between the j u s t i c e sector and c i v i l society, academia, and politicians. 
One o f i t s aims w i l l be t o develop a road map o f concrete technical s teps required to extract the 
executive branch at the loca l leve l f rom i t s jud ic ia l responsibilities. This exercise w i l l complement 
the wo rk o f development partners in the broader c r im ina l justice sector. T h i s includes w o r k by the 
Un i ted Nations Development Programme (UNDP), DFID and Japan t o improve the effectiveness and 
efficiency o f the Bangladesh police by supporting key areas o f access t o justice, human resource 
management and training, and prevention, investigation, and prosecution o f crime.

122. Expe r ience in other countries suggests t h a t governance re fo rms best succeed when 
society demands them , no t when the re fo rms a r e imposed by ex te rna l actors. A central focus o f 

the Bank’s energies (and those o f i t s development partners) w i l l be to help further strengthen voice, 
empowerment, and participation in a country where c i v i l society has made huge strides in a ve ry 
short time. The Bank w i l l increasingly wo rk w i t h c i v i l society, academia, and think tanks t o help 
build consensus around governance reforms and t o monitor progress in governance. I t w i l l 
increasingly partner w i t h c i v i l society and academia in analytical w o r k o n issues o f governance and 
in the production and dissemination o f high-quality in fo rma t ion on the extent, incidence, and 
consequences o f corruption. Over t i m e t h i s engagement w i l l help strengthen the public’s perception 
o f the need fo r governance reforms and increase the pressure o n g o v e m e n t s to undertake such 
reforms. 
Fo r c i v i l society to engage w i t h government on the qua l i ty and efficiency o f pub l ic 
institutions, i t w i l l be important t o address t h e relatively l im i ted fo rma l access to in fo rma t ion held by 
pub l ic authorities in what i s otherwise a very open society. This access remains l im i ted because there 
are few institutional mechanisms through wh ich citizens can obtain such information. The PRSP sees 
addressing t h i s issue as 
“ the most impor tan t entry p o i n t ” 
fo r enhancing accountability and 
transparency. I t sees a freedom o f d o r m a t i o n law as an important long-term goal. Such a law wou ld 
provide citizens w i t h a lega l ly enforceable right to obtain, through clearly defined procedures, 
information he ld by government o n matters o f pub l ic concern. I t wou ld also encourage government 
to publish in fo rma t ion about i t s activities. As in other jurisdictions, a freedom o f in fo rma t ion law

T h e Bank ’s ana lyt ica l w o r k w i l l exp lore how the public’s access to in fo rma t ion can b e 
enhanced and how greater transparency can b e b rough t to the budget, pub l ic procurement , 

and the pub l ic po l icymak ing process as a means o f stimulating demand fo r reforms in governance, 
inc lud ing through watchdog NGOs. The Bank w i l l support g o v e m e n t efforts to strengthen I C T and 
apply e-governance initiatives in key sectors. The Bank w i l l also wo rk w i t h i t s partners t o help bring 
about attitudinal changes among c i v i l servants so that they see themselves as “servan ts o f the people” 
and are encouraged to be open and transparent in the i r work. Participatory analytical wo rk in t h i s 
area, undertaken w i t h development partners, w i l l feed a national debate o n the ro le o f in fo rma t ion in 
development, contribute to a national in fo rma t ion policy, and potentially lead t o a freedom o f

Program, seeks t o build the capacity o f Bangladesh’s Public In fo rma t ion Department t o manage and 
disseminate information and the capacity o f the media to access government information, with a 
focus o n excluded groups such as ru ra l women, indigenous populations and char-land dwellers. This 
work, in conjunction w i t h t h e wo rk o f development partners active in governance and transparency,

said to be among the highest, in the w o r l d relative to income, and campaign fmancing i s thus thought 
to be a major source o f corruption. One contributing factor i s the limited enforcement o f laws and 
regulations relating to the declaration o f assets and liabilities o f high pub l ic officials and the f a i l u r e 
to make such declarations public. Recognizing th is , the G o v e m e n t has agreed to rev iew the 
implementation o f the relevant legislation and policies, recommend necessary actions, and make the 
review public. The re are also ma jo r issues o f intraparty democracy, wh ich l i e at the roo t o f t h e 
present confkontational politics. U n l e s s and until these issues are addressed, other reforms cannot 
fully succeed. I t i s in these areas o f po l i t ica l governance reform, including strengthening po l i t ica l 
competition and ensuring f r e e and fair elections that the Bank intends t o re ly o n i t s bilateral 
development partners to engage the Government in dialogue and provide support. With t h i s in mind, 
the Bank i s in active dialogue with these partners on strengthening their efforts to support such 
governance reforms. 

E. LONGER-TERM STRATEGIC ISSUES 

126. The CAS touches o n a number o f longer-term issues. Upgrading agricultural research, 
evaluating fu tu re directions fo r higher education, strengthening loca l governance, and strengthening 
institutions o f accountability are among the issues w i t h long-term implications f o r Bangladesh’s 
development. As Bangladesh enters i t s election cycle, there i s a significant r i s k that many such 
important po l icy issues now at the top o f the development agenda w i l l take a back seat. 
127. This potential fa l low pe r iod fo r the Bank’s po l icy dialogue also creates an opportunity to 
take a n integrated v iew o f some o f the development challenges that Bangladesh’s economy w i l l face 
over the next several decades. High among these w i l l be environmental issues . Na tu ra l resources 
have provided the p la t fo rm fo r much o f Bangladesh’s economic development and growth. The 
wetlands sustain abundant fisheries that provide 60 percent o f the country’s p ro te in consumption, 
wh i le forests and natural vegetation remain the primary source o f cooking fue l fo r the bulk o f the 
country’s population. But there are g row ing s i g n s o f declining natural resource and ecosystem 

37 

productivity, threatening the country’s poverty reduction efforts and longer-term g row th prospects. 
In addition, rap id urbanization-including 
the high population concentration in Dhaka, l i k e l y t o 
become one o f the world’s most populous cities-has generated a litany o f environmental problems 
that accentuate poverty through environmental health r i s k s associated w i t h deteriorating air and 
water quality and sanitation problems. Indiscriminate discharge o f industrial effluents to ground and 
surface water and weak enforcement o f environmental regulations pose a significant threat to 
ecological balance as w e l l as serious health r isks , particularly among the vulnerable and the urban 
poor. Developing a strategy t o deal w i t h environmental problems (including the eastern r ivers) and 
an understanding o f the drivers o f urban growth wou ld enable Bangladesh t o better cope w i t h i t s 
projected population o f 250 m i l l i o n in 2050. 
128. D ive rs i f ica t ion o f Bangladesh’s economy f r om i t s current export dependence o n garments 
w i l l also be a major issue and i s t h e subject o f an ongoing Bank study o n constraints to long-term 
growth. O n t h e social side maintaining progress toward the MDGs and look ing beyond 2015 to 
progress over the next 25 years w i l l determine the po l icy priorities over the next decade. And above 
all, building the institutions that w i l l guide and shape t h e po l i t ics and economy o f Bangladesh in the 
21 s t century w i l l be at the heart o f any long-term development perspective. 
129. 
The Bank w i l l w o r k w i t h i t s development partners and w i t h leading academic and po l icy 
research institutions in Bangladesh to revisit t h e challenges o f longer-term development in the 
country. I t w i l l use t h e inevitable interregnum imposed by the po l i t ica l calendar to encourage a 
debate in Bangladesh society on key long-term development issues and help shape directions fo r 
fu tu re wo rk that wou ld influence the po l icy and development directions in future PRSPs. The Bank 
also plans t o prepare po l icy notes fo r the incoming government-an agenda fo r i t s future support. 

IV. DELIVERY OF THE WORLD BANK PROGRAM: LEARNING FROM RECENT 
EXPERIENCE 

A. LESSONS LEARNED31 

T h e strategy d u r i n g the last C A S (F‘YO1-03) was one o f a g radua ted response to 

130. 
Bangladesh’s deve lopment challenges, operating ma in ly in a l ow case and shifting in to the base 
case as the pace o f reforms accelerated w i t h the new government that came t o power in 2001. A 
strategic shift began in FY03, when the f i r s t development p o l i c y loan-after 
several years o f l ow - 
level engagement-was approved by the Boa rd o f Executive Directors fo l low ing significant progress 
o n pub l ic expenditure, financial management and procurement, banking, and state-owned enterprise 
reforms. Good p o l i c y performance has continued and h a s been supported through follow-up 
Development Support Credits. The Bank has pursued a more strategic, po l icy - leve l engagement 
since then, and i t s relations and leve l o f dialogue w i t h the country have imp roved as a result. 

131. On the outcomes out l ined in the F Y O l CAS, the Bank effect ive ly supported human 
development and economic g row th but was less successful in he lp ing t o p romo te governance 
improvements and r u r a l development. De l ive ry o f the Bank’s assistance was affected by i t s 
limited engagement in several key sectors, including infrastructure. Moreover, poor understanding o f 
country conditions and the po l i t ica l economy o f refonns constrained the Bank in developing a 
responsive country program, w i t h the result that a disconnect emerged between the lend ing program 
and analytical work. T h e Qua l i ty Assurance Group viewed the lend ing program as no t sufficiently 
broad based, wh i le at the project leve l t h e Operations Evaluation Department found that outcomes 
had been mostly satisfactory. 
132. 

Indeed , disengaging f r o m such c r i t ica l sectors as bank ing , powe r , a n d wa te r h inde red

o n governance, the Bank was unable t o support the country in key areas o f pub l ic administration 
reform, decentralization, and anticorruption. T h e Bank’s strategy might have appeared appropriate at 
the time, given governance challenges and the po l icy stance in some sectors. In retrospect, however, 
the extent o f disengagement envisaged during the last CAS appears excessive considering 
Bangladesh’s overall economic and social performance. 
133. 
found the quality o f ind iv idua l tasks to be consistently good, a conclusion confirmed by the 2004 
Client Survey, whose respondents said that the Bank was effective in producing knowledge. 
Respondents were less positive about t h e Bank’s ab i l i ty to adapt i t s knowledge to Bangladesh’s 
needs, however. O n t h i s aspect the Quality Assurance Group found that the AAA program lacked 
client input o n i t s scope and that preparation o f reports lacked client participation. I t also faulted the 
AAA program f o r poor dissemination. 
134. 
S im i l a r messages consistently emerged f r om the Bank’s extensive CAS consultations w i t h 
different segments o f Bangladesh society, the Government, the private sector, academia, c i v i l 
society, and the donor community (see attachment 5). A l l emphasized the need to pay attention t o the 
po l i t ica l economy o f reforms and country-specific circumstances to support the design o f more 
effective interventions.‘ They also strongly expressed the need fo r the Bank to strengthen i t s ow n 
fiduciary requirements and t o m in im ize possibilities fo r corruption in i t s ow n projects. 

135. Going fo rwa rd , the country strategy w i l l inco rpo ra te the lessons lea rned from the last 

CAS and m o r e recent experience (box 4). The Bank Group w i l l need to operate differently in the 
face o f the challenges i t confronts. First, i t w i l l need to pay better attention t o loca l conditions and 
realities, avoiding routine solutions to country-specific challenges and helping to promote a common 
v iew and approach around critical po l icy issues, especially o n goveniance. Second, a particularly 
d i f f icu l t challenge in Bangladesh, the Bank Group w i l l need to recognize the fiduciary r i s k 
environment in wh ich i t operates and take adequate measures to mitigate the risk. 

Box 4. Lessons f r om the Las t CAS and Recent Experience 

To enhance the development impact, i t is important to remain engaged and able to respond as opportunities arise 
even when the re foms appear dzficult to achieve. A more positive and constructive level o f engagement has 
proved more effective in pushing reforms. Moreover, reengaging in a sector after years without dialogue and 
lending i s usually more d i f f icu l t and costly. 
Development po l icy lending has effectively supported the Government’s rejopm agenda and helped to deepen 
p o Iicy dialogue across several c r i t i c a l sectors. 

There is a need to pay close attention to the p o l i t i c a l economy of reforms and develop rea l is t ic expectations about 
the ir scope and pace. CAS implementation showed that, given country conditions, reforms cannot always be 
advanced comprehensively and at an even pace. Nevertheless, the Government’s commitment t o reform resulted in 
measurable progress in key areas even though the reform agenda could not be pursued equally across a l l sectors. 
Governance is an area where a pos i t ive and constructive approach-moving 
from rhe tor ic to concrete, p rac t ica l 
support-would 
likely y ie ld better results. In practical te rms , this means unbundling governance issues to 
implementable levels, gaining more in-depth understanding o f these issues, and going beyond traditional areas o f 
past engagement. 
The country p rog ram supporting CAS outcomes shou ld be especially responsive to c l ien t capab i l i t ies and 
ins t i tu t iona l capacities. Simultaneously, t h e program needs to b e selective while maximizing partnerships with 
development partners. “Good local fit” based on a thorough institutional analysis should be particularly 
emphasized. 
The Bank needs to develop a more strategic and, when relevant, progpammatic view of ana ly t ica l and advisory 
activities (M A ) , l ink ing the AAA p rog ram c lear ly to the CAS outcomes and focusing on governance i n everything 
i t does. Sector work should be better aligned w i th lending development, while analytical work should be developed 
in parallel to support the reform agenda, focusing particularly on how to implement specific, d i f f icu l t reforms. 
Involvement o f the client should be enhanced, and opportunities for partnerships with other donors actively sought.

B. WHAT THE WORLD BANK WILL DO DIFFERENTLY AND BOW 

136. 

T h e k e y lessons f r o m recent experience and the results o f the CAS consultations ca l l f o r 
the B a n k G r o u p to do a n um b e r o f things d ifferent ly: 

First, the Bank w i l l ensure that the results focus o f the CAS i s reflected in everything i t does 
in Bangladesh, f r om lending and AAA to the way i t manages fiduciary risks. 
Second, the Bank w i l l make governance a central focus o f i t s work, influencing decisions 
about sectoral priorities, the composition o f Bank lending and AAA, and the type o f 
instruments deployed. 
Third, the Bank w i l l attempt t o systematically invo lve beneficiaries and affected 
communities in the design and implementation o f a l l i t s activities. 
Fourth, the Bank w i l l seek t o build strong partnerships w i t h academia, c i v i l society, and t h e 
international donor community. 
Fifth, the Bank w i l l become increasingly open and transparent in the way i t does business, 
enhancing disclosure and reaching out to a l l sections o f Bangladesh society and thus 
positioning i tse l f t o become a reliable long-term development partner o f Bangladesh. 
Finally, the Bank w i l l step up i t s efforts to strengthen fiduciary safeguards in the projects 
and programs i t funds and reduce fiduciary risk even as i t continues t o proactively manage 
the po r t fo l io and improve implementation (see section IV.E). 

A governance-oriented CAS w i l l requ i re new ways o f do ing business to ensure effective 

imp lementat ion , with s h i f t s in staffing, institutional processes, and culture (see fo l low ing sections). 
Staffing adjustments w i l l s ta r t w i t h key members o f the Bangladesh country team. A governance 
adviser w i l l be h i red in FY06; a Dhaka-based legal and jud ic ia l re fo rm adviser h a s been hired; and 
Dhaka-based positions fo r an operations adviser and lead economist w i t h a strong focus on 
governance w i l l be advertised in FY06/07. N ew sector team members w i t h strong governance 
experience w i l l also be sought. 

13 8 . 

Ins t i tu t iona l processes w i l l b e reo r ien ted to ensure a governance dialogue throughout 

p ro jec t and AAA p repa ra t ion . Fo l low ing good practice in other Bank Regions, an operations risk 
management team i s be ing established to provide peer advisory services o n core and sector 
governance issues, a l low greater knowledge sharing across teams, and institute early warning 
systems fo r high-risk projects (see section IV.E). Country-specific policies already in place require 
early inception notes fo r a l l projects and AAA before formal allocation o f budgets. T h e inception 
notes require teams t o outline governance risk issues early in the concept stage. A ser ies o f sector- 
specific po l i t ica l economy and govemance studies have been initiated, such as the one fo r the 
Chittagong po r t and an upcoming study o f the power sector. 
139. 

Feedback f r o m clients a n d f r o m o the r donors po ints t o the need f o r m o r e t ranspa ren t 
business practices in Bang ladesh to ensure effective partnersh ips , reduce perceptions o f 
corrupt ion , and encourage voice and pa r t ic ipa t ion . The Bank’s program has recently benefited 

fiom a more strategic external affairs engagement. A new external affairs manager has been hired, 
and outreach efforts are be ing scaled up. A new “Bangladesh Development Series” capturing a l l 
Bangladesh-related analytical w o r k i s be ing provided to a broad d is t r ibu t ion l i s t o f donors, 
government, and c i v i l society. Similarly, the Bank i s expanding i t s program-specific dialogue w i t h 
c i v i l society, academia, parliamentary bodies, and the private sector through an enhanced W o r l d 
Bank Ins t i tu te program. And t o ensure maximum voice and participation, many o f the Bank’s new 
programs have a strong focus o n community involvement. These include loca l governance, urban 
development, and social protection.

140. The most difficult change w i l l be cultural. The country team w i l l ho ld a retreat soon after 
approval o f t h e CAS to internalize the priorities and governance orientation. T h i s CAS w i l l require 
greater cross-sectoral work, stronger country t e am alignment o n acceptable r i s k s , and a clear 
understanding o f expectations relating to governance w i t h i n projects and AAA. The process o f 
cultural change w i l l be continuous, w i t h fo l low -on activities including workshops w i t h other 
development partners and the Government. The country team w i l l discuss incentives fo r promoting 
good governance in project design and best-practice mon i to r ing during supervision. Similarly, an 
effort i s be ing undertaken to forge team syne rg ies among key governance sectors, such as between 
urban development and loca l governance or between legal and jud ic ia l re fo rm and wo rk o n growth 
and economic management. 

e. LENDING AND WORLD BANK GROUP INSTRUMENTS-A 
1. World Bank Lending and Analytical and Advisory Activities 

STRATEGY OF ENGAGEMENT 

141. Under the 14 th rep len ishmen t o f IDA resources (DA14 ) Bangladesh’s performance-based 
allocation fo r FY 0 6 i s $750 m i l l ion . A s i m i l a r annual average has been assumed fo r the CAS 
period.32 This volume o f lending takes in to account the governance ratings fo r Bangladesh built in to 
the Country Po l icy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) as w e l l as po r t fo l io performance. I t also 
reflects the “governance factor” integral t o the performance-based allocation formula, so that 
governance factors weigh heavily in Bangladesh’s IDA allocation. This l e v e l o f lending w i l l a l low 
the Bank Group sufficient resources to fo l low a strategy o f strong engagement t o address 
Bangladesh’s key development constraints through a range o f instruments. These w i l l include 
development po l icy lending, investment lending, and interventions that t rans fe r resources directly to 
the poor, inc lud ing CDD-based or loca l government capacity building operations, positioning the 
Bank as a long-term partner in supporting Bangladesh’s poverty reduction agenda. 
142. 
The strong governance filter o n the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy w i l l have significant 
implications fo r the lending program (see attachment 9 and Annex B3). T h e Bank w i l l continue to 
engage the Government o n po l icy and institutional reforms supported by Development Support 
Credits and Poverty Reduction Support Credits, planned to comprise around 30-40 percent o f total 
lending. These i n s t r um e n t s have proved highly effective in supporting strategic reforms across a 
range o f sectors and institutions and have given the Bank access to the highest levels o f decision 
mak ing (attachment 10). But i t w i l l increasingly focus these budgetary support operations on 
imp rov ing sector and core governance. Moreover, access t o these credits and to any sector po l icy 
operation w i l l be conditioned o n four economic management and governance-related benchmarks 
that are key t o creating a n enabling environment fo r more effective use o f the Government’s 
budgetary resources and B a n k - f i a n c e d budgetary support: 
Ma in ta in ing macroeconomic stability, inc lud ing adhering t o the targets established under 
the agreed macroeconomic framework supported under IMF programs. 
Mee t ing the revenue targets established under the PRSP’s macroeconomic framework, 
as revised under t h e Government’s agreements with the IMF. 
Ach iev ing satisfactory progress o n t h e annual benchmarks to be established under the 
agreed Pub l ic Expenditure and F inanc ia l Accountability (PEFA) framework, wh ich 
wou ld be aimed at imp rov ing Bangladesh’s P F M ratings over the medium term? 
Enacting a new procurement act satisfactory to IDA and satisfactorily implementing 
procurement reforms as agreed in the PEFA framework and past development po l icy 
lending operations. 
The Bank’s support fo r Bangladesh’s investment operations w i l l also have a strong governance filter. 
A l l support t o investments in a sector w i l l address the key governance and institutional constraints to

that sector. In particular, infrastructure operations w i l l attempt to enhance the transparency and 
accountability o f private provision o f infrastructure. 
143. A l l new projects and programs w i l l attempt to systematically invo lve beneficiaries and loca l 
communities in the i r design and implementation. Beneficiary mon i to r ing o f outcomes w i l l be key in 
ensuring a strong focus on results in the Bank’s program. In addition, as noted, the Bank w i l l 
increasingly re ly o n CDD-type operations or projects w i t h C D D components t o deliver rural 
infrastructure and social services, re ly ing o n communities to prioritize needs. T o reduce t h e r i s k s o f 
leakage o f funds, Bank-funded programs w i l l institutionalize a s h i f t in the responsibility fo r ho ld ing 
pub l ic officials accountable f r om external third parties such as the Bank t o loca l communities, wh ich 
stand to lose the most f rom a failure t o deliver o n program and project objectives. 
144. 
I f a deterioration in po l icy performance or governance failures should make i t d i f f icu l t t o 
reach agreement on the po l icy program underlying Development Support Credits or, th roug l i lower 
CP IA ratings, lead to a reduction in resources available to Bangladesh, the Bank w i l l rely 
increasingly on CDD-type projects t o reach poo r communities in Bangladesh t o ensure that lower 
resource transfers do no t adversely affect i t s poor. 

145. The Bank’s analytical and advisory activities w i l l also be managed more strategically, 

t o support and i n f o rm po l icy and governance reforms, feed in to Bank lending operations, and reach 
out to key constituencies in Bangladesh by w ide ly disseminating major analytical products translated 
in to Bengali. In i t s AAA the Bank w i l l attempt to focus systematically o n the po l i t ica l economy o f 
reforms, address governance constraints in the sectors and thematic areas covered, carry out 
governance assessments o f key institutions that i t may w ish to support, pos i t ion i tse l f o n key 
development and governance issues, and help build consensus fo r reforms. The Bank w i l l also use 
AAA t o provide technical and advisory support through focused po l icy notes, particularly t o the new 
government. In addition, the Bank w i l l increasingly use AAA to wo rk w i t h loca l p o l i c y think tanks 
and academic institutions t o foster debate and dialogue in Bangladesh, particularly o n sensitive 
governance issues, and t o build loca l capacity fo r po l icy analysis. Given the cross-cutting nature o f 
the development agenda, the Bangladesh country team w i l l establish cross-sectoral thematic groups 
that collectively p r io r i t ize and manage AAA wo rk and take accountability for delivering genuinely 
cross-sectoral wo rk (see annex B4). 
146. 
T h e Bank’s AAA i s expected t o p lay an especially important ro le in FY07 , when the po l icy 
dialogue with the Government cou ld slow as the country heads toward an election and the related 
po l i t ica l uncertainty and po l icy vacuum. The Bank intends to use t h i s period t o under take j o i n t 
studies w i t h loca l institutions aimed at developing a better understanding o f longer-term issues in 
danger o f being neglected by policymakers-issues 
in such areas as the environment (including the 
impact o f global warming), governance, higher education, urbanization, and cross-border regional 
integration (see section III.E). 

2. 

IFC Program 

147. O n December 31, 2005, IFC’s held po r t fo l io in Bangladesh stood at $132.5 m i l l i o n in nine 
projects. O f t h i s , $102.9 m i l l i o n i s fo r IFC’s ow n account and $29.6 m i l l i o n fo r B - loan participants. 
The projects span a range o f sectors, inc lud ing power, telecommunications, cement, and financial 
markets. I FC w i l l continue to provide equity, long-term debt, and guarantees in support o f loca l and 
foreign private investment. IFC w i l l also continue substantial programs o f technical assistance 
through SEDF and FIAS, focusing o n developing SMEs, imp rov ing the investment climate, and 
promoting foreign direct investment.

3. M I G A P r o g r am 

148. MIGA’s outstanding po r t fo l io in Bangladesh consists o f f ive contracts o f guarantee in the 
manufacturing and telecommunications sectors w i t h a gross exposure o f $1 12.1 m i l l i o n (around 2.3 
percent o f MIGA’s total exposure). MIGA recently underwrote an investment by an Egyptian 
investor in the telecommunications sector totaling $79.2 m i l l ion . During the CAS period MIGA 
plans to support foreign investors in the telecommunications, infrastructure (power), and natural 
resources sectors. I t w i l l focus i t s technical assistance program o n he lp ing t o build the capacity o f t h e 
main government institutions focusing on private sector development, p r inc ipa l ly the Board o f 
Investment. MIGA w i l l deliver a range o f technical assistance services designed t o enhance the 
board’s capacity t o promote Bangladesh as a location fo r foreign direct investment, to address 
investors’ needs during the investment process, and to develop effective investor aftercare and po l icy 
advocacy functions. MIGA w i l l also wo rk w i t h the W o r l d Bank and IFC t o build the capacity o f t h e 
Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority. 

4. Expend i tu re E l ig ib i l i ty unde r the C o u n t r y Assistance Strategy 

149. Country Financing Parameters (CFPs) fo r Bangladesh were approved o n M a y 13,2005 (see 
attachment 8). Under the CFPs IDA may finance up to 100 percent o f the costs o f individual 
operations, but counterpart funds w i l l be encouraged. Cost sharing arrangements w i l l be determined 
case by case, taking in to account several factors. These include the Government’s program and 
budget fo r the relevant sector, alignment with PRSP and CAS priorities, project context and impact 
o f the cost sharing arrangements on project implementation and achievement o f development 
objectives, implications fo r the CAS envelope, and other potential sources o f financing. The 
application o f the CFPs i s based o n the grounds that the Government has fo l lowed prudent fiscal and 
debt management policies and has shown i t s commitment to implementing the country’s PRSP. 
Nevertheless, t h e increased f lex ib i l i ty i s expected to be used in well-justified cases and w i t h careful 
consideration o f sustainability r i s k s . Moreover, in applying the proposed financing parameters, the 
Bank w i l l continue to ensure that a l l Bank-supported projects include adequate fiduciary 
management and oversight arrangements consistent w i t h the governance strategy o f the CAS. 

D. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 
AND PERFORMANCE 

150. Bangladesh’s po r t fo l io performance , m u c h weake r in the recent past, i s now b road ly in 
l ine with the average f o r Sou th Asia a n d f o r a l l IDA - o n l y countries. In FY05 the disbursement 
ratio for Bangladesh’s portfolio, at 23 percent, was s i m i l a r t o the IDA average and substantially 
h ighe r than the 10 percent disbursement ratio fo r the ADB ’s broadly s i m i l a r po r t fo l io . T h e share o f 
projects at r isk i s lowe r than the IDA average, and project outcomes are broadly satisfactory (table 6; 
fo r recent trends, see annex B2). 
151. Despite recent progress, however, project implementation continues to be slow, and t h e 
country po r t fo l io continues t o have a large undisbursed amount, totaling $1.5 b i l l i o n at the end o f 
FY05. T h e average project implementation period has continued t o increase, g row ing from 2.8 years 
in FY02 t o 3.6 in FY05.33 This increase i s to some extent a result o f the g row ing number o f project 
extensions. In FY05, fo r example, Bangladesh had 10 project extensions, out o f a to ta l o f 35 in South 
Asia. 

3 3 The average implementation period i s measured by the Bank as the average age o f projects in the country portfolio (see annex B2).

153. 

The main factors influencing po r t fo l io performance, as noted in the CAS Completion Report 
(see attachment 6), have been inadequate government ownership o f and commitment to project 
objectives and project design, wh ich have o f ten been overambitious and thus d i f f icu l t to achieve; 
delays in project start-up due to, among other things, weak preparatory work, particularly o n t h e 
recruitment o f project consultants and government approval o f projects; weak implementation 
capacity; poor procurement management and inadequate pub l ic sector accountability; insufficient 
attention to the po l i t ica l and institutional context o f projects; lack o f realism and weak qua l i ty o f 
reporting in supervision; and poor mon i to r ing and evaluation systems. 
Po r t fo l io performance has also been affected by decisions to extend several at-risk projects 
(some o f them actual problem projects), or to postpone partial credit cancellations, in order t o 
support program development objectives. Fo r example, $200 m i l l i o n in emergency financing f o r 
2004 post-flood rehabilitation was reallocated f r om three at-risk o r problem projects whose 
remaining balances wou ld otherwise have been canceled. 
154. O n the Bank’s human resource side, the departure o f key staff f r om the Dhaka office, and 
the consequent loss o f mentoring and senior expertise, may have weakened t h e ab i l i ty o f the Country 
O f f ice to p lay i t s expected role in project implementation and supervision. Reconstituting the 
staffing pattern, inc lud ing posting to the Country O f f ice senior international staff w i t h responsibility 
fo r k e y sectors o f engagement, w i l l be an important human resource feature o f the strategy. 
The Government and the Bank have responded to these issues, achieving some i n i t i a l 
positive results, Besides the overall efforts to improve procurement and financial management, as 
agreed aRer the FY04 Joint Country Po r t fo l io Performance Review, the Government, supported by 
development partners including the Bank, has taken several initiatives to improve project 
iniplementation. These include establishing a more streamlined project approval process, inc lud ing 
the new “Development Project Proposal”; ensuring better recruitment o f consultants by introducing a 
consultant recruitment monitoring system, adopting an action plan to expedite recruitment o f 
consultants in two key l i n e ministries, and requiring early preparation o f complete consultant 
inv i ta t ion documents; and strengthening mon i to r ing and evaluation, w i t h a special focus o n the 
Internal Mon i to r ing and Evaluation Department, the agency responsible fo r implementing 
mon i to r ing and evaluation o f development projects. W h i l e progress has been made o n each o f these 

155. 

44 

F iduc ia ry issues have also been p rom inen t concerns across the portfo l io . Indeed, w i t h 

fronts, critical issues remain, largely due to the limited delegation o f authority t o l i n e ministries and 
implementing agencies that s t i l l prevails.34 
156. At the same t im e the W o r l d Bank has been wo rk ing w i t h l i n e ministries and implementing 
agencies in developing and maintaining systems fo r monitoring and evaluation o f project 
performance and in using the available data to iden t i fy areas o f lagging performance. In addition, the 
Bank has been closely mon i to r ing project and po r t fo l io progress and regularly p rov id ing the 
Government w i t h a consolidated l i s t o f upcoming due dates and deadlines. 
157. 
governance weak and corruption levels high, there are considerable r i s k s to the Bank’s portfolio in 
Bangladesh. Delays occur in implementation as documents and decisions are reviewed and re- 
reviewed at various levels w i t h i n government, since government budget and human resource 
management systems include layers o f formal sign-offs and other types of protection against 
malfeasance but relatively few incentives to achieve real resu l ts . Tracking studies suggest evidence 
o f leakage, generally, f r om the social sector programs financed by the Bank and other donors. 
Procurement post-reviews, a recently completed independent procurement review o f selected 
projects and INT investigations have indicated irregularities under some Bank operations. In 
addition, the Bank has undertaken assessments o f the country’s 
financial management and 
procurement systems through various studies (see para 159) and pa id particular attention during the 
last CAS period to strengthening the Government’s own systems. 
158. 
Learning f r om these efforts and cognizant o f recent cases under investigation or scrutiny, the 
Bank w i l l again give t h i s area particular attention during the upcoming CAS, as described in the 
fo l low ing section. 

E. MANAGING THE WORLD BANK’S FIDUCIARY AND IMPLEMENTATION RISK 

159. 
T h e Bank’s efforts during the last CAS period to help strengthen the Government’s fiduciary 
r i s k management began w i t h a Country Financial Accountability Assessment c*ed 
a Country Procurement Assessment in 2002. These led to Bank support fo r government procurement 
and financial management reforms, resulting in considerable progress o n procurement and modest 
but systematic progress o n financial management. As discussed (see section III.D), the CAS w i l l 
further strengthen the Bank’s support fo r these reforms. These ins t i tu t ion building efforts w i l l take 
t i m e to have an impact, however, and in the meantime the Bank needs to significantly deepen i t s own 
fiduciary risk management. 

out in 2001 and 

160. Recognizing t h i s , the Bank recently completed a retrospective review o f independent audits 
o f procurement under eight projects undertaken for the Bank by external consulting fums over t h e 
past four years and a samp le o f external audit reports o f Bank-financed projects. T h e review revealed 
frequent instances o f probable collusion in bidding, made possible by poor procurement practices- 
including insufficient time allowed fo r bidding, delays in tender evaluation, lack o f transparency in 
bidding, inadequate bid securities, and the l ike . Other findings included poor record keeping and 
documentation by project entities, inc lud ing inadequate documentation to support variation f rom the 
contract amount during implementation or to support claims against statements o f expenditures. T h e 
Bank responded by declaring misprocurement in some cases and by taking other actions that were 
ma in ly project specific. 

161. W h i l e t h e Government h a s a set o f sound regulations that w i l l soon be reflected in 
procurement law, implementation o f the in ten t o f the new law w i l l be key. T h e Bank, through i t s 
lending and dialogue, w i l l support such implementation, but achieving progress o n t h i s and o n

financial management i s l i k e l y to remain a challenge for some time. Under the new CAS the Bank i s 
developing and w i l l beg in t h e implementation o f a r o l l i n g Operational R i s k M i t iga t ion P lan that w i l l 
strengthen i t s capacity t o manage risk systematically throughout i t s portfolio, including through 
re t ro f i t t ing ongoing operations as feasible. T h i s strategy w i l l comprise the fo l low ing key building 
blocks: . Systematic analysis of c o m p t i o n risk through AAA and in p ro jec t preparation. The Bank 
w i l l integrate a corruption focus in assessing the capacity o f the country and project 
authorities to manage procurement and financial management, including agency in fo rma t ion 
and documentation management practices; the quality o f governance in key institutions in 
t h e sector or program being supported; the Bank’s past experience w i t h these agencies; and 
the incentives and disincentives fo r corrupt behavior among the key stakeholders. This 
enhanced knowledge should assist the Bank in better addressing corruption r i s k s (see 
below). I t w i l l also result in the Bank staying away f r om institutions u nw i l l i n g to address the 
issues raised in such diagnostic work. Diagnostics in other countries suggest that 
community-driven programs bolstered by social accountability measures may be less 
susceptible to corruption. T h e Bank accordingly plans t o direct an increasing share o f new 
lending t o such programs, where the onus o f responsibility fo r ho ld ing pub l ic o f f ic ia ls 
accountable i s institutionalized in loca l communities and the beneficiaries o f such programs, 
facilitated by Bangladesh’s strong N G O sector. 
Smart p ro jec t design. I f the corruption risk assessment shows that the m i n i s t r y or agency 
managing a project would, w i t h some help in addressing i t s weaknesses, be an appropriate 
partner fo r the Bank, the next s tep wou ld be to des ign the Bank-supported intervention so as 
to reduce corruption r i s k s . Supply-side measures that address institutional weaknesses and 
ensure implementation o f t h e Government’s new procurement policies-including making 
systematic use o f e-procurement, imp rov ing procurement planning, and ensuring that the 
outside members o n bid evaluation committees h o l d the process t o appropriate standards o f 
integrity-will 
need to accompany demand-side measures that a l low adequate oversight o f 
procurement, financial management, and project outcomes by beneficiaries, NGOs, and c i v i l 
society in general. The Bank w i l l wo rk to systematically improve procurement practices by 
p romo t ing the u s e o f e-procurement and improved procurement planning. And whenever 
appropriate, i t w i l l use the dynamic Procurement R i s k M o d e l in project preparation. 
Stronger supervision. Beyond the regular project supervision that addresses p o l i c y and 
institutional issues, the Bank w i l l undertake each year, beginning in FY06, an integrated, in- 
depth technical, procurement, and financial management review o f projects w i t h high 
fiduciary risk. This review can include sampling contracts, visually inspecting the actual 
delivery o f work, fo l low ing up o n audit findings and recommendations, and rev iew ing 
in te r im financial management reviews. The Country Po r t fo l io Performance Review w i l l 
sharpen i t s focus o n c o m p t i o n issues. The country team w i l l w o r k w i t h the Department o f 
Institutional Integrity to develop a procedure fo r more effectively addressing complaints 
relating to corruption. 
M o r e systematicpursuit of remedies. The Bank w i l l be more rigorous in identifying r e d flags 
indicating corruption and pursue misprocuremerit and other remedies when appropriate. I t 
w i l l agree w i t h the Government that the Government w i l l take firm action against o f f ic ia ls 
who should be he ld accountable and w i l l build greater awareness o f the consequences o f 
corruption among government staff. The Bank w i l l enhance the follow-up o n audit 
objections, inc lud ing remedies in the case o f material, systemic issues. 
Enhanced information disclosure. The Bank w i l l agree w i t h the Government to the release 
o f certain documents that w i l l help enhance the transparency and accountability o f Bank- 
financed projects. These wou ld include aide-memoire o f implementation review missions,

audit reports and the Government’s formal responses to these reports, procurement plans and 
schedules, bidding documents and requests fo r proposals, shortlists o f consultants, and 
summaries o f bid evaluations that do no t reveal confidential commercial information 
provided by bidders. The Bank w i l l wo rk w i t h c i v i l society t o help monitor project 
implementation. 
162. Managing a risk m i t iga t ion program o f t h i s intensity w i l l requ i re that the Bank organizes 
i tse l f better to do so. T h e operations adviser in Dhaka w i l l be empowered to guide the en t i re process

Subsector Th em a t i c L e ad e r s 

To maximize the effectiveness o f i t s programs, the Bank Group i s developing a strong 
partnership w i t h key development partners in Bangladesh. As a f i r s t step the Bank Group prepared 
this CAS j o i n t l y w i t h the Asian Development 
the U.K. Department fo r International I Box 5. Jo in t Strategy: Ma in Sector and 
Development, 
and 
Japan. 
These 
four 
development partners together deliver $1-1.5 
b i l l i o n a year in a id to Bangladesh and w e l l over 
80 percent o f a l l i t s development assistance. An 
effort has been made t o ensure that the j o i n t 
CAS process i s fully transparent and open and 
that the j o i n t strategy has the full support o f 
development partners in the Dhaka-based Loca l 
Consultative Group.36 The process has used an 
inclusive approach to bring other development 
partners in to t h e discussions o n different sectors, 
consistent w i t h mutual interests. T h e Loca l 
Consultative Group has also been invo lved in 
the ongoing consultations o n the j o i n t CAS (see 
attachment 7 ) . 
164. The objectives in having a j o i n t CAS 
include ensuring better coordination and greater 
complementarity across the project pipelines o f I 
the four donors, giving consistent messages t o the Government, and re in fo rc ing one another’s efforts 
in supporting specific sector reforms. The j o i n t CAS i s thus expected t o also facilitate the 
development o f sectorwide approaches beyond those in health and education, fo r example, in one or

165. The j o i n t CAS implies a common assessment o f t h e PRSP, agreement o n a common set o f 
broad outcomes, and a common understanding o f the strategies needed to deliver these outcomes.

The ADB’s Country Assistance Program was approved in October 2005. 
36 Thirty-two countries, bilateral agencies, and multilateral organizations are members o f the Loca l Consultative Group. In addition, there 
are 24 technical subgroups on sectors ranging f rom agriculture to governance t o HN IA IDs . Mos t subpups serve as a channel for 
coordination and dialogue among donors, to forge common understandings and integration o f policies, approaches, and efforts. The 
subgroups are generally chaired by the agency w i th a primary progratn in the sector.

investments (box 5). Under t h e j o i n t approach each institution maintains i t s ow n business plans and 
project and AAA pipelines, and each has i t s ow n documentation, consistent w i t h i t s requirements. 
However, a j o i n t r e s u l t s ma t r ix shows outcomes and benchmarks fo r the CAS period, together w i t h 
a l l the interventions by the four CAS partners supporting a g iven outcome (see attachment 1). 
Implementing a j o i n t approach implies higher transaction costs fo r a l l parties, and the need to 
achieve the desired complementarity or collective approach may impose additional constraints on t h e 
composition and delivery o f a partner’s program. 
166. Partnerships w i t h other donors w i l l continue. The Bank i s invo lved in sectonvide approaches 
in health and education. I t has initiated sector-specific consultations in t h e context o f the CAS w i t h 
the aim o f bringing in the larger donor community, and j o i n t w o r k and cofmancing are expected in 
sectors o f mutual interest. 
167. 
In other partnerships the Bank’s program w i l l build on Bangladesh’s strengths o f a vibrant 
c i v i l society, strong intellectual and research tradition, and dynamic private sector to maximize 
impact. Partnerships with loca l communities, fo r example, can help shift the onus o f enforcing 
accountability f r om the Bank t o the beneficiaries. They can also strengthen checks and balances and 
encourage d i f fbs ion and decentralization o f power and decisionmaking. The Bank w i l l also build 
strong partnerships w i t h c i v i l society, academic institutions, and the private sector, inviting them, as 
appropriate, t o contribute to and participate in project design, implementation, and mon i to r ing as 
w e l l as the Bank’s analytical wo rk and consensus building o n po l icy reforms. 
168. A l l four CAS partners are committed to supporting harmonization around government 
systems in their interventions to the extent possible. Through the Loca l Consultative Group, donors 
are wo rk ing o n a Harmonization Ac t ion Plan, wh ich fo l lows o n the Paris Declaration o n Aid 
Effectiveness, where governments and development institutions committed t o far-reaching and 
monitorable actions t o increase a id effectiveness. 
169. An important f i r s t step in t h e Bangladesh Harmonization Ac t ion Plan took place recently, as 
the Government took the lead in coordinating the a n n u a l donor forum. The Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Implementation Forum in November 2005, chaired by the Government, i s now part o f an 
annual high-level process to mon i to r implementation o f the PRSP. At the fo rum the Government 
announced i t s intention to also chair sector-level a id coordination wo rk ing groups invo lv ing L o c a l 
Consultative Group donors and to chair a midterm review o f progress o n implementation w i t h such 
donors. The W o r l d Bank w i l l support t h e transition t o a Government-led a id coordination process 
consistent w i t h the Paris Harmonization principles, as w e l l as implementation o f the Government’s 
Harmonization Ac t ion Plan. Actions t o do so w i l l include strengthening the Government’s leadership 
o f the aid coordination process; ensuring that harmonization principles and Government leadership 
are incorporated in to key activities supported by the Bank and development partners, such as 
sectonvide approaches and j o i n t M, and participating in the Government-led donor wo rk ing 
groups to track implementation o f the PRSP.

R I S K S AND M IT IGAT ION 

1. R i s k s Fac ing Imp lemen ta t ion o f the Government ’s Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy 

170. 
The last CAS, completed on the eve o f the 2001 elections, iden t i f ied three potential r i s k s to 
the Government’s development goals: the election cou ld r e s u l t in a weak coa l i t ion o r in a new 
government u nw i l l i n g to reform, there could be macroeconomic slippages, and the country’s 
vulnerability t o natural disasters cou ld divert attention and resources f r om development. None o f 
these r i s k s materialized in any significant way. Elections produced a Iandslide v ic to ry fo r the BNP 
and i t s allies, wh ich initiated a number o f reforms. Macroeconomic r i s k s were managed well, and 
Bangladesh continued t o en. o y economic g row th and macroeconomic stability despite intense 

48 

T h e po l i t ica l risks appea r the most severe, with inev itab le consequences f o r the 

confrontational politics and violent incidents. And as demonstrated in the serious floods o f 2004, the 
country’s ab i l i ty to manage disasters has greatly improved, reducing loss o f l i f e and economic 
disruption. A l l t h i s suggests that Bangladesh’s resilience to po l i t ica l and economic shocks should no t 
be underestimated. Even so, a l o o k ahead t o the remaining years o f t h e decade reveals severe risks 
that w i l l require managing. 
171. 
economy. The past two years have seen a significant worsening in the po l i t ica l climate and a marked 
deterioration in law and order. Increased po l i t ica l violence, including po l i t ica l assassinations, has 
further intensified the confrontational po l i t ics and fed t h e deepening d i s t r u s t between the two major 
po l i t ica l parties. With elections approaching, in January 2007, there i s a distinct risk that violence 
may increase and that the key institutions charged by the Constitution w i t h ensuring fa i r and peaceful 
elections-the Election Commission and the neutral caretaker government, wh ich w i l l assume power 
three months before elections-will 
come under severe pressure in Bangladesh’s confi-ontational 
po l i t ica l environment. An election result no t accepted by one po l i t ica l party or the other cou ld lead to 
a prolonged po l i t ica l crisis, distracting attention f r om Bangladesh’s poverty reduction agenda. T h u s 
less than a year in to t h i s CAS, a deepening po l i t ica l crisis may greatly hamper i t s implementation. 
There i s l i t t l e that the W o r l d Bank can do to mitigate such a po l i t ica l risk. The W o r l d Bank’s 
bilateral CAS partners are actively engaged in a dialogue w i t h the Government and opposition 
parties aimed at mitigating t h i s r i s k . The W o r l d Bank i tse l f w i l l , together w i t h i t s partners, try to 
engage Bangladesh’s po l i t ica l elite and c i v i l society w i t h a v iew to developing a consensus o n the 
development agenda across the po l i t ica l divide and enhancing awareness o f the serious economic 
costs o f confrontational politics. The W o r l d Bank w i l l also monitor the situation and use the m id te rm 
review o f the CAS to adjust the assistance strategy as appropriate. 
172. A related risk i s that in a period o f intense po l i t ica l ac t iv i ty there w i l l be l i t t le po l i t ica l 
appetite to address the r e f o m i n governance that are central to successful implementation o f t h e 
Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. Vested interests may also continue t o hamper attempts to 
implement reforms. The W o r l d Bank w i l l w o r k with i t s partners to engage key reformers in a close 
dialogue to try t o mitigate t h i s risk. I f these expectations materialize, t h e W o r l d Bank w i l l focus i t s 
energies o n progress in one o r two key areas where reforms appear bo th feasible and highly 
beneficial. I t w i l l also support donor-led efforts t o strengthen the demand fo r reforms f r om c i v i l 
society and the private sector. 
173. Another related r i s k i s weak implementation capacity. Even if the po l i t ica l w i l l fo r re fo rm 
exists, the steady deterioration in t h e quality o f the c i v i l service and weak incentives due t o l ow 
pub l ic sector salaries and poor management o f the c i v i l service could contribute to slow progress in 
implementing the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. The W o r l d Bank w i l l attempt to 
mitigate t h i s r isk through strategic interventions in support o f improved capacity building in key 
areas and support fo r a merit-based p romo t ion and recruitment system, inc lud ing a senior service 
p o o l p rov id ing strong leadership to the c i v i l service. 
174. 
R i s k s to the g row th assumptions underlying the CAS come f rom the increased competition 
that Bangladesh’s garment and textile exporters are facing fo l low ing the end of 
the Mu l t iJb re 
Arrangement after January 1, 2005. Wh i le there h a s been no serious disruption o f exports in the 
i n i t i a l year since the MFA ended, the W o r l d Bank w i l l , as described above, support efforts t o re fo rm 
the tax administration and regulatory environment and improve infrastructure provision w i t h a v iew 
t o reducing the high cost o f doing business in Bangladesh. These efforts w i l l help restore 
competitiveness, remove impediments to foreign and domestic investment, and thus facilitate greater 
diversification o f the sources o f growth. T h e W o r l d Bank Group w i l l also provide po l icy advice and 
dialogue o n competitiveness issues relating t o the garment and textile sector in the pos t -MFA era. In 
addition, SEDF w i l l continue t o help the ready-made garment industry adjust to the changing ma rke t 
that i t i s facing. 

49 

175. 
Finally, Bangladesh’s economy remains highly vulnerable t o the risk o f natural disasters. 
The W o r l d Bank w i l l continue to support t h e improvements Bangladesh has made in disaster 
mitigation, wh ich have greatly reduced the size o f the shocks imposed by natural disasters on the 
economy. Wo rk ing with i t s partners, the W o r l d Bank w i l l support efforts to mainstream disaster 
management in relevant government institutions. 

2. R i s k s Facing Implementation o f the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy 

176. 
Pervasive corruption in Bangladesh exposes t h e W o r l d Bank’s po r t fo l io to high risk. Failure 
t o address t h i s risk carries high development effectiveness, fiduciary, and reputational r i s k s fo r the 
Bank. As noted, the W o r l d Bank w i l l mitigate t h i s risk by wo rk ing w i t h the Government to 
strengthen i t s fiduciary controls and engaging w i t h the Government in efforts to prevent reversal o f 
i t s recent reforms in procurement policy. Recognizing that progress in t h i s area may take time, 
however, the W o r l d Bank also w i l l take measures to strengthen i t s ow n fiduciary controls in 
operations that i t finances (see section IV.E). W h i l e these measures are un l ike ly to eliminate t h e r i s k s 
o f corruption in Bank-financed operations, they should, i f properly implemented, significantly 
reduce those r i s k s over time. They w i l l also greatly mitigate the associated reputational r i s k s as the 
Bank i s increasingly seen to be mov ing decisively to curb corruption in i t s operations. 
The upcoming elections may slow the FY07 lending portfolio, n ow planned to proceed at a 
regular pace because o f Bangladesh’s development needs, as a result o f a pe r iod o f potential 
inac t iv i ty associated w i t h t h e caretaker government and the subsequent formation o f a new 
government. To mitigate t h i s risk, the FY07 po r t fo l io i s planned to include projects that are at an 
advanced stage o f preparation and wou ld likely be processed before the caretaker government takes 
power.

Progress toward Achieving the Millennium Development Goals 

Attachment 2 

1. 
A mixed p ic tu re emerges fo r Bangladesh fi-om two recent MDG studies, conducted by the 
W o r l d Bank and t h e UN /GoB . O n the one hand, there has been remarkable progress o n several 
MDGs , such as gender parity, consumption pove r ty and c h i l d mo ra l i ty . There are also several 
MDGs within reach, but that w i l l require special attention and concerted e f fo r t . Finally, there are 
a group o f MDGs that w i l l challenge the coun t ry f o r some t ime . 

2. 
Bangladesh has already attained (or nea r ly so) the goa l re la t ing to e l im ina t ion o f gender 
disparity in schoo l ing opportunities. Bangladesh i s the o n l y coun t ry in South A s i a other than S r i 
Lanka t o have achieved parity in ma le and female enrollments n o t just at the primary l e v e l but 
also at the secondary level. T h i s i s an impressive achievement fo r a coun t ry that i s one o f the 
poorest countries in the world, with a per capita gross na t iona l income o f o n l y US$1,770 (in PPP 
terms) in 2002. 
3. 
The analysis in the repo r t further suggests that attainment o f two other MDGs - in 
particular, the reduc t ion o f consumption-poverty and unde r - f ive m o r t a l i t y - i s also feasible w i th 
a comb ina t ion o f interventions, inc lud ing sector-specific interventions (such as expanding 
immun iza t ion coverage and reduc ing pupil-teacher ratios), economic growth, imp roved coverage 
o f infrastsucture, and social safety-net programs (such as the Educa t ion Stipends P rog ram and 
the Vu lne rab le G roup Development programs). 

4. 
However, i t w i l l be challenging f o r Bangladesh t o attain t h e c h i l d ma lnu t r i t ion - re la ted 
MDG as w e l l as the education M D G s re la t ing t o un ive rsa l ne t primary enrollment and primary 
completion. In the case o f c h i l d ma lnu t r i t ion , the p ro jec t ions suggest that Bangladesh cou ld 
come very close t o - witlxn 5 percentage po in ts o f - the MD goa l o f h a v i n g n o mo re than 34% o f 
i t s ch i ld ren underweight. However, i t w i l l be very cha l leng ing fo r the coun t ry to attain rates o f 
net primary en ro l lmen t and primary comp le t ion exceeding 8 3 4 6 % by 2015. T h i s assessment i s 
based o n household survey data. Other studies (UN/GOB) u s i n g administrative data show that 
primary net enrolment target w i l l b e met. 

5. 

Acco rd ing t o t h e UN /G o B MDG assessment, another goal that w i l l b e d i f f i c u l t t o achieve 
i s that related to im p r o v i n g maternal health, indicators o f which, such as the maternal m o r t a l i t y 
ratio, remain among the wo rs t in the wo r ld . The MMR, f o r example, f a l l s in the range o f 320 t o 
400 in 2001. In order f o r Bangladesh to meet the target f o r ma te rna l mo r ta l i ty , t h i s f igu re m u s t 
b e reduced t o 143 per thousand live births, w h i c h w i l l requ i re the inducement o f m a j o r 
behavioral changes in mothers, far greater access t o qua l i ty reproductive hea l th services, and a 
generally imp roved socio-economic situation. 

6. 
With respect t o water, the UN /G o B assessment observes that arsenic contamination has 
reduced the percentage o f people with access to safe water f r om nea r ly 100 percent d o w n to 
r o u g h l y 80 percent in urban areas and 70 percent in r u r a l areas. T h i s presents a ma jo r challenge 
t o imp rove outcomes by changing ing ra ined behaviors lead ing t o the use o f contaminated water 
f r om g round tube we l ls and/or by p r o v i d i n g safer technologies t o affected villages. In the case 
o f sanitation, an emerging set o f challenges t o MDG attainment i s d r iven partly by urbanization, 

69 

as o n l y 14 percent o f slum dwellers in me t ropo l i tan areas have access t o sealed latrines. G i v e n 
that the urban popu la t ion i s projected to nea r ly double t o 50 m i l l i o n people by 2015, adequate 
p rov is ion o f water and sanitation t o urban dwellers w i l l b e c ruc ia l f o r reaching these MDGs. 

7 . 

B e i n g located o n a flood p l a i n with very limited natural resources, Bangladesh 
experiences acutely the effects o f environmental degradation. De t r imen ta l environmental 
conditions are also exacerbated by poverty, with many m i l l i o n s o f poo r people turning t o the 
extremely l im i t e d forest products (Bangladesh has one o f the lowes t amount o f forest cover per 
capita o f any nation) f o r the i r b io - fue l and energy needs. Reversing the trend o f deforestation 
and increasing energy efficiency, therefore, w e i g h h e a v i l y o n the MDG agenda o f ensuring 
environmental sustainability. T h e f inanc ia l and ins t i tu t iona l resources necessary t o accomplish 
these objectives, however, pose s ign i f ican t challenges t o attainment o f this MDG. 

8. 
Wha t accounts f o r t h e extraordinary progress in im p r o v i n g social indicators in 
Bangladesh? Some have commented that Bangladesh’s better performance m a y have t o do with 
the fact that pub l ic expenditure o n hea l th as a p ropo r t ion o f GDP i s almost tw i c e as high in 
Bangladesh (1.5%) as in, say, I n d i a (0.9%). T h i s was n o t always so. In 1990, Bangladesh spent 
o n l y 0.7% o f i t s GDP o n hea l th - less than what I n d i a spent (0.9%) 
(UNDP 2004). Thus, 
Bangladesh saw pub l ic spending o n hea l th increase v e r y sharply during the 1990s, w h d e I n d i a 
experienced stagnation in p u b l i c spending o n hea l th (in re la t ion to GDP growth). 

9. 
I t i s instructive t o l o o k at p u b l i c educational expenditures in Bangladesh and I n d i a as 
we l l . In 1999-2001 , India’s p u b l i c spending o n education was 4.1 % o f i t s GDP - considerably 
greater than p u b l i c spending o n education in Bangladesh, w h i c h was o n l y 2.3% o f GDP (UNDP 
2004). However, as in the case o f health, p u b l i c expenditure o n education in Bangladesh 
increased f r om 1.5% o f GDP in 1990 t o 2.3% o f GDP in 1999-2001 - an increase o f mo re than 
50%. In contrast, pub l ic spending o n education as a share o f GDP increased by me re ly 5% over 
the same pe r iod in I n d i a - fi-om 3.9% t o 4.1% o f GDP. Add i t iona l ly , there i s an impo r tan t 
difference between Bangladesh and I n d i a in the compos i t ion o f p u b l i c spending o n education. 
W h i l e Bangladesh spends 45.1 % o f i t s to ta l p u b l i c expenditure o n education at the p re -p r ima ry 
and primary level, the relevant f i g u r e f o r I n d i a i s 38.4%. At t h e other extreme, I n d i a spends 
20.3% o f i t s to ta l pub l ic spending o n education at the tertiary level, in contrast t o Bangladesh’s 
1 1.1 % (UNDP 2004). Thus , the r a p i d g r ow t h o f p u b l i c spending o n education and hea l th in 
Bangladesh, combined with i t s better balance o f educational spending across the p r im a r y and 
te r t ia ry sectors (relative t o India), are l i k e l y t o b e impo r tan t factors in exp la in ing the s ign i f ican t 
progress the coun t ry has made in i t s social indicators during t h e 1990s. 

10. 
Ano the r factor that i s l i k e l y t o b e impo r tan t in exp la in ing Bangladesh’s re la t ive success 
in attaining pos i t ive social outcomes i s the w o r k o f i t s NGOs. Bangladesh m a y w e l l b e the 
wo r ld ’s leader in using NGOs as vehicles o f development. NGOs are i n v o l v e d in virtually every 
ac t iv i ty in t h e coun t ry - r e l i e f and rehabilitation, pove r ty alleviation, health, education, social 
protection, and environmental protection, t o name a few. A v i l lage r in Bangladesh can send h s 
o r he r c h l d t o an N G O school, have family planning and basic hea l th services de l ive red by an 
NGO hea l th worker, ob ta in m ic ro -c red i t f inanc ing fi-om a choice o f several NGO banks, sell 
milk and other da i ry products to an NGO da i ry cooperative, and make a telephone c a l l o n an 
NGO telephone. Secondary education in Bangladesh i s almost en t i re ly p rov ided by the non- 

70 

government sector - viz., 
t h e NGOs, for-profit schools, and re l ig ious schools (madrasas). 
L ikew ise , many o f the family planning programs o f the 1970s and 1980s, w l u c h set the stage f o r 
the subsequent decline in c h i l d mo r ta l i ty , were primarily delivered th rough NGOs . And several 
studies suggest that m ic ro -c red i t programs, w l u c h were pioneered by one o f the best-known 
NGO s in the world-the Grameen Bank-have had a s ign i f ican t effect o n reduc ing poverty, 
especially among females. 

11. 
Y e t another factor in exp la in ing Bangladesh’s success, especially i t s a b i l i t y to eliminate 
gender d ispa r i ty in en ro l lmen t even at the secondary level, i s the use o f targeted pub l ic 
interventions, such as the Female Secondary School Stipend P rog ram (FSSS). The FSSS 
p rog ram i s essentially a Cond i t iona l Cash Transfer (CCT) o r a demand-side in te rven t ion fo r rural 
g i r l s (the m a j o r i t y o f w h om are poor) to attend secondary school. By a l l indications, the FSSS 
p rog ram has been h u g e l y successful in increasing female secondary school enrollments, 
especially since secondary schoo l ing in Bangladesh i s n o t free and parents are o f ten unwilling t o 
invest in the secondary schoo l ing o f their daughters. 

12. 
However, Bangladesh’s progress o n the MD indicators during the 1990s does n o t mean 
that there are n o problems go ing forward. Indeed, there are several areas o f rema in ing concern. 
First, there are very la rge reg iona l disparities in virtually a l l o f the MD indicators in Bangladesh. 
D is t r ic ts such as Noakhali, Pathuakali, Chittagong, Rajshahi, and Sylhet have generally n o t 
pe r fo rmed w e l l o n several o f the MD indicators. E v e n i f Bangladesh as a who le attains some o f 
the MDGs , the re w i l l b e several areas o f the coun t ry that w i l l r em a i n d is tan t ly behind. The 
ana lys is in the W o r l d Bank report suggests that p o o r performances o n many o f the MD 
indicators a re geographically concentrated in a few regions. %s 
in turn means that targeting 
interventions, central government resources, and economic g r ow t h opportunities t o the lagg ing 
d iv is ions and districts w i l l speed up attainment o f t h e MDGs. 

13. 
Second, the p r o b l em o f governance - in particular, poo r service delivery - i s widespread 
in t h e social sectors in Bangladesh. Doctors, hea l th workers and teachers a re t y p i c a l l y absent 
f r om the i r assigned posts at government hea l th centers and schools. Membe rsh ip o f school 
management committees i s highly po l i t ic ized , and teacher rec ru i tmen t i s o f ten subject t o 
personal influence. Procurement o f textbooks and essential drugs i s r i f e with corruption. The 
qua l i ty o f hea l th and education services o f fe red at mos t government hea l th fac i l i t ies i s generally 
very poo r , Y e t the evidence presented in t h i s repo r t indicates the tremendous importance o f 
service de l ive ry in i n f l u e n c i n g MD outcomes. Infant and unde r - f ive m o r t a l i t y rates have fa l len 
mos t in areas where e f fec t ive family planning and M C W F P programs are delivered t o r u r a l 
women with l o w schooling; female school enrollments have increased t h a n k s to a well-designed 
and we l l -de l ive red secondary stipend p rog ram that reaches i t s in tended beneficiaries; and p u b l i c 
transfer programs that de l ive r f o o d supplies to the vulnerable in m a l areas, such as Food - fo r - 
Work, Vu lne rab le G roup Feed ing and Vu lne rab le G roup Development, are associated with large 
reductions in c h i l d m a l n u t r i t i o n among t h e poorest children. This suggests that better 
governance, and im p r o v e d de l ive ry o f social services in particular, w o u l d b e v e r y impo r tan t t o 
attaining the MDGs. 

14. 
Better de l ive ry o f p u b l i c services - whether in health, schooling, nu t r i t ion , o r 
infrastructure - i s a comp lex and d i f f i c u l t task that entails creation o f the right ins t i tu t ions and 

71 

incentives, inc lud ing devo lv ing respons ib i l i ty f o r service de l ive ry to loca l governments and 
communities, contracting ou t certain types o f service de l ive ry t o t h e non-government sector, 
empowering consumers t o demand better services &om government health facilities, in t roduc ing 
compe t i t ion among p u b l i c providers, and ensuring the mo t iva t ion o f f ron t - l ine workers (W o r l d 
Bank 2003). 

15. 
There are some other findings fkom t h e W o r l d Bank report that are use fu l t o reiterate. The 
report notes the re i s evidence o f s ign i f ican t synergies among the d i f fe ren t MDGs. F o r instance, a 
reduc t ion in the p ropo r t ion o f underweight ch i ld ren i s strongly associated with a reduc t ion o f 
c h i l d mo r ta l i ty . A l t h o u g h maternal m o r t a l i t y i s an MD ind ica to r that has n o t been analyzed in 
t h s report, i t i s clear that interventions that reduce maternal mo r ta l i ty , such as tetanus 
immun iza t ion , expansion o f antenatal care coverage, and an increase in the ra t io o f 
professionally-attended deliveries, w i l l also bring about large reductions in infant (especially 
neonatal) mo r ta l i ty . L ikew ise , reduc ing c h i l d m a l n u t r i t i o n i s l i k e l y to result in b o t h schooling 
quantity and quality, as better nourished ch i ld ren are mo re l i k e l y to attend school and p e r f o rm 
better in school. Thus there a re synergies amongst the MDGs that w i l l he lp in the i r attainment, 
w h i c h imp l ies that proceeding with simultaneous action o n a l l these measures w i l l have the 
greatest impac t o n attainment o f the MDGs. 

16. 
The simulations carried out in the W o r l d Bank’s MDG assessment also suggest that 
economic g r ow t h that b r ings about an imp rovemen t in household living standards i s s t rong ly 
associated with v i r t u a l l y every MD indicator. F o r example, rea l per capita GDP g r ow t h o f 4% 
per annum in Bangladesh cou ld alone bring d ow n the unde r - f ive m o r t a l i t y rate by about 8 deaths 
per 1,000 l i v e births and the incidence o f pove r ty by 21 percentage po in ts between n o w and 
2015. In addition, t h i s g r ow t h cou ld bring about an increase in the net primary enrollment rate o f 
5 percentage po in ts by 2015. In other words, r a p i d economic g r ow t h cou ld make s ign i f ican t 
contributions t o a n improvement in a l l the MD indicators between n o w and 201 5.

MEDIUM TERM MACRO FRAMEWORK 

I. Mac roeconom ic Pe r fo rmance During the Last CAS 

1. GDP growth performance has been good. GDP growth averaged 5.4% per annum over the FYO 1-05 
period, the highest 5-year average since independence. Growth has been underpinned by a resurgence o f 
private investment; wh ich grew at an annual average rate o f lo% , increasing i t s share in GDP f r om 16% 
in FYOl to 18.5% in FY05 . The share o f pub l ic investment in the meanwhile f e l l f r om 7% to 6%. Wh i le 
benefiting f r om continued strong export g row th (about 8% p.a.), w i t h garment exports being the mainstay, 
g row th has also been fa i r ly broad-based. Construction and services sectors in particular have grown 
strongly fueled by large remittance in f lows . Agriculture sector g row th has been rather anemic, averaging 
j u s t 2% over t h e period. 
the fiscal deficit at around 3.5% of GDP, partly through curbs o n w a s t e l l 
2. Containment of 
expenditures, has improved the prospects for fiscal sustainability. Fiscal de f ic i t has been lowered f rom 
around 6% in FYOO to 3.5% in FY05 and i t s financing patterns made more prudent, w i t h increased 
emphasis o n concessional external fmancing. Benefiting f r om good g row th and fiscal prudence, public 
sector debt has been contained at under 50% o f GDP and appears o n a sustainable pa th although there are 
potential risks. A particular concern i s the growing liabilities o f the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation 
(BPC) due to the recent increases in global o i l prices that have no t been fully passed-through to 
consumers; resulting BPC losses equaled 0.7% o f GDP in FY05 . 
3. Monetary policy has broadly supported growth while doing a good job of containing inflation. 
In f la t ion remained below 5% over t h e FYO1-03 period, r is ing to 6% in F Y 0 4 and further to 6.5% in 
FY05 . Bangladesh Bank was slow to respond t o the exogenous pressures on in f la t ion a r i s i n g f rom global 
commodity price increases and the 2004 floods, but has tightened monetary p o l i c y considerably since 
Ma rch 2005. 
4. The external sector has benefited from strong growth in exports and remittances, which supported 
equally robust growth of imports, including of capitalgoods. Exports increased by 40% and remittances 
doubled over the FY00-05 pe r iod wh i le imports increased by 50%. The current account recorded s m a l l 
su rp luses in fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004 before slipping in to a de f ic i t equaling 0.9% o f GDP in 
FY05 . Sharply rising cost o f o i l and other commodity imports contributed t o the current account deficit 
in the latest year. Benefiting also f r om a pick-up in concessional and other long-term capital inflows, 
foreign exchange reserves increased f r om their precarious leve l o f US$ 1 b i l l i o n (or 1 mon th o f impo r t 
cover) in end-2001 t o a more comfortable U S $ 3 b i l l i o n by end-FYO5. 
5. Authoritiesfloated the exchange rate in May 2003. The exchange rate has been relatively stable 
since, w i t h taka losing about 15% o f i t s value against t h e dollar, although exceptionally strong import 
g row th has put i t under some stress since the beginning o f 2005. Impo r t g row th has been fueled by a 
sha rp r i s e in o i l imports ( o i l imports exceeded forecast levels by about US$500 m i l l i o n in FY05), 
increases in demand for intermediate goods and capital machinery due to increased domestic activity, and 
higher r ice and wheat imports to cover shortages caused by floods. Early on in 2005, Bangladesh Bank 
used i t s reserves to support the taka almost to the limit specified in the macroframework agreed w i t h the 
IMF, but has subsequently allowed the taka t o depreciate and tightened monetary conditions to s tem 
further pressures. 
6. Although external debt is relatively low - at about 33% o f GDP and that too mos t ly o n concessional 
terms - because o f modest export levels (14% o f GDP in FY05), the country faces some medium-term 
liquidity risks: the ratio o f ne t present value o f fu tu re debt servicing obligations to goods and non-factor 
services exports stands at about 150%. A good record on macro stability has l e d t o renewed interest by 
foreign investors. Bangladesh i s close to completing an agreement w i t h the Tata Group o f Ind ia wh ich 

73 

wou ld bring in FDI wo r th US$2.5 b i l l i o n in production plants f o r energy, steel, coal, and fertilizers. I f i t 
does goes through, i t wou ld be the s ing le larges t foreign investment deal fo r Bangladesh. Further, t h e 
Abu Dhab i Group recently announced a decision to inves t U S $ I b i l l i o n in telecommunications, 
pharmaceuticals, and hotels. 

II. Macroeconom ic Prospects over the N e x t CAS 

7 . The Government’s medium-term macroeconomic framework commits to f isca l and monetary 
prudence and deepening structural reforms. The framework envisages acceleration in GDP g row th 
f rom 5.4% in FY05 to 6.0% in FY06 and 6.5% in FY08 . Such faster g row th wou ld require a significantly 
h ighe r leve l o f investment and more efficient investment decisions than in the past. Achievement o f 
these, in turn, assumes acceleration in the pace o f structural reforms to tackle supply-side bottlenecks. As 
suggested by a recent W o r l d Bank report,’ g row th rates o f around 7% wou ld be feasible i f the 
Government scales up i t s efforts to improve economic governance and reduce regulatory costs, address 
infrastructure constraints (especially ports and power), deepen and improve the efficiency o f the financial 
sector, improve labor quality, and fu r the r lower trade barriers. 
Investment rates wou ld need t o r i s e 
substantially to a l e v e l un l ike ly to be covered by higher private savings alone: t h i s w i l l require fiscal 
prudence (cutting budget deficits, lowe r ing SOE losses etc.), continued donor support, and significant 
increases in foreign capital in f lows . 
8 . The Government’s f isca l policy aims to f inance social development and key public investment 
while containing the deficit and maintaining debt sustainability. The l e v e l o f pub l ic expendituxe, at 
nearly 14% o f GDP, i s l ow by global standards, reflecting weak revenues and l ow implementation 
capacity. Total tax and revenue collection rates remain among the lowest in the wo r ld at 8 and 10% o f 
GDP. T h e medium-term framework envisions improvements in these. Revenue to GDP ratio i s projected 
to increase to 12% by FY 0 9 as a result o f modernization o f t h e National Board o f Revenue, and the 
expenditure to GDP ratio t o 15.5%. Fiscal deficits wou ld be contained at or under 4% o f GDP and 
domestic financing o f these wou ld be limited to under 2% o f GDP, t o ensure continued fiscal 
sustainability. Fiscal sustainability w i l l further depend o n t h e Government’s ab i l i ty t o contain the 
emerging contingent l iab i l i t ies being generated as a result o f the g row ing losses o f the BPC. Pass-through 
o f international price increases to domestic consumers wou ld be important to contain that r isk . Continued 
monetary prudence wou ld be necessary to contain in f la t ion at the targeted rates o f 7% in FY 0 6 wh ich 
wou ld be lowered down to under 5% by FYO 8 , especially in the face o f rising commodity prices. 
9 . Export pegormance faces considerable risks and some opportunities from the dismantling of 
the 
Agreement on Textiles & Clothing (ATC) from January 2005, wh ich exposes Bangladesh t o 
competition f rom garment exporters previously restricted by quotas. This poses a considerable challenge 
fo r the economy, because t h e garment sector accounts fo r over three-quarter o f total exports, and directly 
employs about 2 m i l l i o n workers, o f whom 90% are women. Woven garment exports seem t o have 
already been adversely affected by the removal o f the quota system, recording -4% g row th over the 
January-June period: knitwear exports grew at 26% over t h e same period, keeping overall garment export 
growth at 7%. I t may s t i l l be too early to assess the long-run impact o f the quota removals. A hopeful 
s i g n i s that new investment and market orders continue to f low . A lso , Bangladesh i s competitive in the 
high-volume, low -ma rg in segment o f the wo r ld market and retains p re fe ren t ia l access t o the EU and 
Canadian markets due t o i t s L D C status. At the same time, the post A T C wo r ld offers some opportunities 
for Bangladesh, as exemplified in the more-than-doubling o f knitwear exports to t h e U S over the January- 
June 2005 period; knitwear exports to the U S were previously constrained by quotas. T h e invok ing o f 
WTO safeguards o n China by the EU and the U S should also bene f i t Bangladesh over the next two years.

Summa ry o f CAS Consultations 

1. 

The Country Assistance Strategy o f Bangladesh that i s be ing presented to the board has benefited 
f r om extensive consultations w i t h various segments o f the Bangladeshi society. These consultations have 
taken place in three stages beginning in early 2004 and the latest taking place in October 2005, in 
partnership w i t h the four j o i n t strategy partners ADB, DFID and Japan. The objectives o f t h i s extensive 
process were to: (i) solicit views o f the Bangladeshis o n issues and development challenges facing them 
in their daily lives, before the conceptualization o f the CAS; and (ii) receive feedback o n the strategy, 
priorities and development programs that the WB and development partners aimed to support. 
First Stage o f Consultations 
2. 
The first stage that took place in February 2004, included t e n rounds o f consultations w i t h 
various stakeholder groups, w i t h three o f these consultations organized in two divisional towns, Rajshahi 
and Khu lna and the others in the capital, Dhaka. Cross-sectional, m ixed and theme-based stakeholder 
groups were inv i ted fo r these three-to-four hour consultations. In December 2004, a consultation meeting 
with indigenous people’s representatives was organized j o i n t l y w i t h the Asian Development Bank at 
Rangamati (Chittagong Hill Tracts) (Box 1). 

Box 1: Reg iona l consultations 

The f i rs t CAS consultations, held at Rajshahi on February 14, 2004 inc luded a m i x e d group o f 42 participants 
comprising academics and researchers, loca l leaders, pr iva te sector representatives, activists and s t a f f f r om 
NGOs and organizations wor lung on human r igh ts and gender issues. This was fo l lowed by a discussion with 2 4 
ru ra l participants in a v i l lage in Charghat upaz i l la o f Rajshahi. Then four meetings were organized in Dhaka 
with various stakeholder groups -- NGO representatives, urban poor, academia and th ink - tanks , and t h e pr iva te 
sector representatives. T h e nex t pub l ic consultation f o r the CAS was h e l d in K h u l n a on M a r c h 18 with a m i x e d 
group drawn f rom cross-sections o f t h i s c i ty . Another consultation with t h e small-medium enterprises (SME) 
and business commun i ty was organized j o i n t l y with the Sma l l Enterprise Development F a c i l i t y (SEDF) and I F C 
in Dhaka. A f t e r a gap o f f i v e months, the nex t series o f consultations was he ld in August with four meetings in 
Dhaka with d i f feren t thematic groups - &sadvantaged youth, retrenched garments workers, representatives f r om 
organizations f o r disabled persons, and un ivers i ty students. 

3. 

Given the i n i t i a l goal o f the CAS team to l is ten to the various viewpoints in the society, the 
process was designed t o be simple, participatory, and interactive. A f te r t h e in i t ia l welcome and 
introductions, the Bank team provided a b r i e f presentation o n the background and the CAS process; the 
participants were then asked to reflect on the successes and achievements o f Bangladesh fo l lowed by their 
views o n i t s problems and failures. The discussion t h e n focused o n ‘what’ could be done and ‘how’ to 
address these issues in the context o f g row th and development and the ro le o f the W o r l d Bank as a 
development partner. 
4. 
Within t h e wide spectrum o f views expressed at the consultations, the achievements and 
successes o f the country were overshadowed by the participants’ negative perceptions o n the current state 
o f affairs in Bangladesh. These included the deteriorating law and order situation, poor governance, 
increase in corruption and po l i t ic iza t ion at a l l levels o f t h e executive and judiciary, the prevalence o f 
confrontational po l i t ica l culture, and lack o f access t o basic services (such as t ime ly and adequate 
healthcare, quality education, arsenic-free sa fe d r ink ing water, and proper sanitation facilities). Problems 
mentioned during most consultations also covered the want o f income-generating activities and 
employment opportunities, 
lack o f 
investment opportunities and 
lack o f security 
fo r 
investmentslinvestors, and bottlenecks in infrastructure (transportation, ports, power, and in fo rma t ion 
technology) as w e l l as the adverse effects o f inadequate po l icy directions and absence o f t ime ly decisions 
national issues (such o n the issues o f gas exports, ports, finance and stock markets).

5 . 

G iven the post-conflict situation in t h e Chittagong Hill Tracts, in t h e Rangamati consultations, 
loca l participants underscored the need fo r implementing the 1997 Peace Acco rd fully, w i t h the 
streamlining o f various legal problems and ensuring that a l l development activities in the region take in to 
account the preferences o f the indigenous peoples. 
Among achievements and successes o f Bangladesh, participants mentioned the increase o f 
enrolment in primary and girls’ education, more awareness o n health, immunization and family planning, 
significant development in transports and communication, ro le o f NGOs (such as schooling fo r urban 
s l u m dwellers), more press freedom, increased coverage o f sanitation and water supply, and micro-credit 
helping income generation. 
7. 
The recommendations f i om these consultations were generally aimed at changing the existing 
scenario o f more negative aspects, where the Bank was to be a facilitator rather than p rov id ing 
prescriptions and could contribute much more to the development process. The areas fo r wh ich 
suggestions were made included: (i) facilitating the improvement o f Government-NGO relations, (ii) 
helping decentralization in different spheres, (iii) exploring the export markets fo r Bangladeshi products 
in a post-MFA world, and (iv) emphasis o n gender and social protection issues . Also, most participants 
indicated the important ro le o f the Bank in human resource development and capacity building, 
improvement o f infrastructure, exploration and u t i l iza t ion o f natural resources, and p romo t ion o f reforms 
and improved governance in the country. 
In addition, a couple o f CAS-related b ra ins to rn ing sessions were also organized fo r the Bank’s 
Dhaka o f f ice staff. O n t h e other side, the CAS team maintained regu la r l ia ison w i t h the Government’s 
team wh ich was then in the i n i t i a l stages o f preparing the full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). 
As the CAS wou ld cover the same pe r iod as the PRSP, i t was envisaged that t h e ma in t h r u s t o f bo th these 
documents w i l l be synchronized -- bo th the CAS and the PRSP a im to address the same basic problems 
and build on the common goal o f sustainable improvement in prosperity fo r the ma jo r i ty o f Bangladeshis. 

Second Stage o f Consultations 

9 . 
T h e second stage took place in July 2005 after the Bank and the development partners were at a 
more advanced stage o f their preparations. T h i s stage included consultations o n the j o i n t strategy o f the 
four CAS partners (in addition to the Bank’s specific) and evolved around the j o i n t outcome ma t r ix that 
summarized, country’s development goals, issues and challenges to achieve them, outcomes that the 
development partners can influence and their programs o f support. This stage o f consultations included 
b o t h small focus discussion groups as w e l l as broader audiences, such as a f o n u n o f Government 
Secretaries, private sector representatives, NGOs and c i v i l society, academics and th ink - tanks , the media, 
and the broader donor community represented by the Loca l Consultative Group (LCG) o f donors, 
10. 
At these consultations, the Joint Strategy was introduced by the head o f one o f the agencies as 
be ing prepared t o have a common approach that wou ld reduce the transactions cost and increase 
coherence o f engagement. A f te r the presentation o n the Strategy, wh ich was aligned w i t h the longer-term 
development agenda as outlined in the draft PRSP, participants were invited to provide their comments o n 
the Joint Results Framework (Outcome Ma t r ix ) and responses were provided by the representatives o f t h e 
four partner agencies. 
11. 
Participants endorsed the strategy and the p r io r i ty areas identified fo r support by the Bank and 
other development partners in connection w i t h the PRSP. Governance and related reforms were 
consistently highlighted as an area o f major concern w i t h participants suggesting the need fo r a concrete 
program to address governance issues. Tack l ing corruption i s an important issue but concrete ideas wh ich 
go beyond stating ‘government failure’ are needed. I t was suggested that the j o i n t strategy cou ld focus 
more o n the developments in the po l i t ica l system, wh ich are important fo r accelerating the country’s 

84 

12. 

economic development. A related question was how the strategy cou ld help in imp rov ing the negative 
perception o f Bangladesh to outsiders. 
Decentralization was repeatedly stressed upon as the way to address development issues in 
Bangladesh, w i t h a consensus on the need for an increased ro le o f loca l governments. T h e development 
partners were asked t o “speak out in one voice’ to push decentralization. 
O n issues o f economy and poverty alleviation, participants mentioned that ‘pro-poor growth’ was 
13. 
no t adequately defined and questions were raised as t o how the strategy intended to achieve i t . I t was also 
pointed that there was insufficient mention o f how the strategy wou ld support the achievement o f MDG 
targets. 
14. 
There were queries as to how the CAS proposed to ensure ‘voice to the people’ and to ensure 
‘round-the-year employment’ fo r the poor, and how i t aimed to reach the hardcore poor and ensure that 
development extends t o the remote and vulnerable areas. 
15. 
Participants suggested t h e identification o f an agricultural po l icy that looked into the issues o f 
small farmers and wage labor. Rather than simple ru ra l development, ru ra l planning and management 
need to be emphasized. Simultaneously, the issue o f rap id urbanization and related urban poverty should 
be highlighted in the CAS. 
16. 
O n human development issues, population g row th and adolescent healthcare were emphasized. 
A r r e s t i n g the deteriorating quality o f education as w e l l as the accountability o f teachers was required 
along w i t h ‘non-partisan’ educational management. Some suggested that the CAS should stress upon 
human security and speak out strongly against human r i g h t s infringements in Bangladesh. 
17. 
Private sector representatives mentioned that the cost o f doing bus iness in Bangladesh was 
becoming high, and the private sector cannot access resources at market cost wh i le there i s not much PPP 
on the ground. The ro le o f private sector and i t s development in the then draft PRSP was no t adequately 
highlighted. The PSD problems highlighted in the coiisultations include bottlenecks in infrastructure, 
high-cost economy, access to finance and credit, and the criminalization o f the economy. The need fo r 
decentralized growth centers and t o have the ru ra l economy grow there by fostering private sector and 
SMEs was underscored. 

18. 
T h e team plans t o fo l low up o n these consultations o n a regu la r basis during the implementation 
o f the program. I t also plans to undertake a m id - te rm review t o assess progress towards the outcomes 
iden t i f ied in the results matrix.

Overview 

2. 
Building o n i t s remarkable achievements, Bangladesh continued t o make good social and 
economic progress during the CAS period despite governance and other structural constraints. T h i s 
progress indicates the country’s potential but also the need to remove these obstacles t o achieve even 
be t ter development resu l ts . As the report shows, wh i le the CAS was relevant to t h i s challenge, t h e overall 
impact o f Bank assistance was modest. By responding in a timely fashion t o the re fo rm commitment 
demonstrated by the new government that took o f f ice in October 2002, the Bank played a catalytic ro le in 
the de f in i t ion o f t h e re fo rm agenda and completion o f Bangladesh’s I-PRSP. In l i n e w i t h the previous 
Bank strategy, the CAS put governance improvement and institutional development at the center o f Bank 
assistance. Translating t h i s broad goal in to measurable r e s u l t s proved difficult, except in a few relevant 
areas such as pub l ic procurement and financial management. In the meantime, governance issues, 
particularly corruption and law and order, continued to hinder CAS implementation and achievement o f 
outcomes. 

3. 
In general, the Bank could no t contribute t o the country’s progress at the levels initially 
envisioned in the CAS. Bangladesh was no t able t o access a l l o f i t s IDA allocation as i t faced d i f f icu l ty 
in meeting the CAS triggers fo r base-case lending levels, wh ich were directly linked to implementation o f 

In addition to country team inputs, the assessment i s based on Bank data and reports related to the country program’s quality, 
responsiveness, and effectiveness. These include t h e 2004 Country Program Assessment b y QAG; t h e 2004 Country Portfolio 
Performance Review (CPPR) conducted jo in t ly by the Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan Bank for 
International Cooperation (JBIC); project documents and Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs); and assessments by 
OED and QAG. 
T h e last CAS was discussed b y the Board on December 12,2000, and the CAS Progress Report on June 19,2003, along with 
the Joint Staff Assessment o f the I-PRSP.

comprehensive po l icy and sector reforms. The CAS requirement - reflecting the dominant perception o f 
Bangladesh as a “poor reformer” - o f upfront reforms before p rov id ing assistance to c r i t ica l sectors such 
as power, banking, and water, restricted Bank engagement, wh i le making p o l i c y dialogue and country 
program development, as w e l l as contribution to some o f t h e CAS outcomes, an increasing challenge. 
Consequently, most o f FYO1-03 IDA lending was made in the last quarter o f FY03. This pattern was also 
repeated in FY04, when most lending was approved in June, and severa l key operations actually slipped 
to the f i r s t quarter o f FY05.3 

4. 

Simultaneously, delivery o f Bank assistance was hindered by poor po r t fo l io performance, Project 
implementation and disbursements slowed down, and in FY04, the latter f e l l to very l o w leve ls . This 
situation was reflected in the deterioration o f the Bangladesh portfolio, wh ich culminated in FY03 w i t h 
one o f the worse performances o f recent years. 

5. 

The above circumstances notwithstanding, the Bank was effective in helping Bangladesh make 
&her human development gains, t h u s contributing pos i t ive ly towards the country’s achievement o f the 
M i l l e n n i um Development Goals (MDGs). Bank assistance also helped maintain good economic growth, 
but overall impact was affected by the Bank’s limited support t o infrastructure and power development. 
A l though the Bank contributed successfully t o the expansion o f ru ra l infrastructure and microfinance, i t 
played a smaller ro le in p romo t ing agricultural growth. Significantly, results from ins t i tu t ion building 
efforts were s t i l l modest, despite constant attention over several CAS periods. 

6. 

H o w t o best help Bangladesh address governance constraints remains among the ma in strategic 
issues fo r Bank Group assistance. To a great extent, the risk-averse behavior o f disengagement f r om 
d i f f icu l t sectors promoted by the prevailing Bank culture and the negative perception o f t h e country was 
imp l ic i t in the CAS design, and became evident during i t s implementation. M o v i n g forward, concrete 
approaches that deal w i t h governance at the program and project level, wh i le attempting t o support 
change f rom w i t h i n those sectors w i t h willingness to refonn, could help achieve better outcomes. As t h e 
country’s experience indicates, reforms can be implemented even under d i f f icu l t po l i t ica l and institutional 
circumstances, although often through an incremental, opportunistic and no t always predictable path. To 
achieve c r i t ica l mass, however, reforms need to be implemented consistently across key sectors and 
po l i t ica l cycles. 

7 . 

Under the above conditions, Bank strategy requ i res increased f lex ib i l i ty in i t s perfonnance-based 
design, no t only in i t s lending triggers, but also in i t s strategic approach t o sectors c r i t ica l t o accelerating 
g row th and poverty reduction. T h i s flexibility should also be reflected in the country program through 
programmatic, increasingly multi-sectoral budgetary support that allows lending t o be attuned to a 
changing and difficult-to-predict re fo rm process, wh i le ensuring that progress i s sustained. At the project 
level, better attention i s also needed t o the po l i t ica l and institutional contexts as w e l l as to cross-sectoral 
constraints that have p roven c r i t ica l t o project implementation, and by extension, project impact and 
sustainability. The focus on results in the new CAS demands, at the same t ime , improved measurement 
and evaluation o f project impact, more strategic design o f analytical and advisory services, and more 
realistic de f in i t ion o f what can be accomplished during the CAS pe r iod given country conditions and 
Bank Group resource constraints.

The context fo r strategy development in 2000 was Bangladesh’s remarkab le social and 
human development achievements and i t s many immediate challenges. Throughout the 1990s, in 

These operations included two adjustment credits totaling US$300 m i l l ion . 

87 

particular, per capita income grew three t im e s faster than the average fo r l ow income countries, as real 
GDP g row th reached about 5 percent per year and the population growth rate was further reduced to 1.5 
percent. At the same t ime , poverty declined after virtual stagnation in the 1980s , as corroborated by a 
decrease in the poverty rate f rom 5 9 in 1991 to 50 percent o f total population by 2000. Moreover, 
Bangladesh continued t o achieve comparatively be t te r progress ih social indicators than countries at 
s i m i l a r income levels. O n the other hand, poverty numbers remained high, inequality increased, and 
economic g row th needed to be accelerated fo r faster poverty reduction. The country’s good g row th 
performance appeared d i f f icu l t to sustain, le t alone t o accelerate, unless the re fo rm agenda was 
reenergized and macroeconomic management put back o n track. Importantly, progress in some human 
development indicators had slowed down; differences in health, nu t r i t ion and population indicators 
remained large across income groups and between genders; and quality o f education and health services 
needed substantial improvement. Environmental management remained weak, and better management o f 
the country’s water resources was urgently needed. N ew challenges emerged, inc lud ing preventing an 
HIV/AIDS epidemic and p rov id ing an effective response to arsenic groundwater contamination. That the 
impressive gains made by Bangladesh had taken place despite governance and other structural problems 
underscored bo th the country’s potential and some o f i t s major constraints. 

9 . 
Bang ladesh made good progress in the past f o u r years, but weak institutions, co r rup t ion 
and de te r io ra t ing l a w and o rde r h inde red achievement o f C A S outcomes and development 

effectiveness. One o f the ma in challenges faced by the Bank in Bangladesh has been finding effective 
ways to assist a country w i t h substantial development needs, but also w i t h entrenched governance 
problems. Opposition t o re fo rm by powe r fu l vested interests remained strong during t h e CAS period, and 
p rogess at the microeconomic and sector leve ls could no t match the success in achieving macro-stability. 
Corruption and the law and order situation discouraged loca l and foreign private investment, wh i le 
Bangladesh’s achievements were obscured by the persistent negative image o f the c o ~ n t r y . ~ A l though a id 
flows slightly increased recently, bo th development assistance and private investment remain 
During CAS implementation, a id effectiveness continued t o be hindered by the country’s lack o f 
institutional capacity, the government’s lack o f ownership o f development p rog ram , and the weak 
project implementation capacity o f the l ine agencies. 

10. 

At the same t ime , the na tu re o f politics in the coun t ry affected b o t h C A S fo rmu la t ion and 

imp lemen ta t ion . The CAS was prepared more than a year before the 2001 general elections, and the 
CAS pe r iod ended w i t h a new government in office.6 Confrontational politics continued t o impede the 
emergence o f a broadly-shared national development strategy, challenging CAS formulation. The absence 
o f consensus o n key policies also affected t h e consistent implementation o f development policies and 
programs across the po l i t ica l cycles, challenging CAS implementation. Under these circumstances, PRSP 
preparation could no t advance as expected, and the Bank’s plan o f preparing a new CAS in FY03 did no t 
materialize. M o r e specifically, t h e CAS suffered f r om the intensification o f confrontational politics, 
characterized by frequent hartah (strikes) and deterioration in human security. Dono r members o f the 
Loca l Consultative Group (LCG), inc lud ing the Bank, fe l t compelled in Ma rch 1999 to voice their 
concerns about the damage being done to the country by confrontational politics, ca l l ing o n government 
and opposition parties t o wo rk together fo r Bangladesh’s future. By 2000, when CAS consultations 
began, the po l i t ica l environment had become highly contentious - and Bank-government relations 
strained - making i t even more d i f f icu l t to build across-the-board po l i t ica l consensus o n country priorities 

In 2003 Bangladesh was ranked in Transparency International’s Perceptions Index as the country perceived as most corrupt in 
the wor ld for the th ird consecutive year, which helped reinforce t h i s image. 
In addition to institutional and political performance, aids flows to Bangladesh had been declining in the period preceding CAS 
preparation because o f lower availability o f donor assistance worldwide. FY99 was an exception to t h i s trend in Bangladesh 
due to the additional aid provided b y development partners, including the Bank, to help with the 1998 flood emergency. 
At the t ime o f CAS preparation, tw o elections and three transitions o f government had taken place since t h e restoration o f 
democracy in 199 1, with the two main parties alternating in power.

prematurely t o the next electoral cycle prevailed at the end o f the CAS period, as corroborated by LCG 
statements during the Development Fonun in M a y 2004. 

11. 
W h e n the C A S was p repa red , the re we re tw o m a j o r uncertainties: first, whe the r a m o r e 
re fo rm is t stance wou ld emerge after the elections; a n d second, wh ich opportun it ies wou ld b e 
ava i lab le to the new government to imp lemen t reforms . The new government - a four-party coalition 

l e d by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) - demonstrated i t s commitment to reforms, although these 
could no t be advanced at t h e pace and levels expected in t h e CAS. Reforms started to gain momentum in 
2002, however, and the CAS Progress Report prepared in 2003 reflects a s h i f t in Bank engagement in l i n e 
w i t h these new circumstances. G iven the d i f f icu l t country conditions, i t i s commendable that the 
economy continued t o pe r fo rm relatively w e l l during the CAS period, and that some d i f f icu l t reforms 
were successfully advanced in c r i t ica l areas such as economic governance, fiscal management, State 
Owned En terpr ises (SOEs), banking, telecommunications and energy. A stronger e f fo r t i s nevertheless 
needed to accelerate administrative, legal, and po l i t ica l reforms.

documents * However, recognizing that the national strategy required more de f in i t ion and broader 
consensus, extensive consultations were carried out during CAS preparation in 2000. In 2003, t h e Bank’s 
strategy was adjusted - through a CAS Progress Report - to respond to the new Na t iona l Strategy fo r 
Economic Growth, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development, wh ich i s the country’s I-PRSP. The 
latter was prepared fo l low ing nationwide consultations, and represents an i n i t i a l statement o f the 
country’s v is ion and goals.’

Specifically, the C A S a imed a t he lp ing Bang ladesh achieve i t s ove ra rch ing goa l - con f i rmed 
in the I-PRSP - o f reduc ing pove r ty substantially within the shortest possible t ime . Bangladesh has 

recognized that faster poverty reduction cannot be accomplished without accelerating and broadening 
economic growth. The strategic objectives o f the CAS, discussed in Section C, were thus selected to 
support the various areas emphasized in the national plan, and later o n in the I-PRSP, t o reach an annual 
g row th rate o f 6 to 7 percent and a poverty reduction rate o f 2 t o 3 percent. These areas include giving 
the private sector a greater ro le in the economy; increasing the pace o f agricultural and non-farm ru ra l 
growth; emphasizing investments in education, nutrition, health, and water and sanitation; and imp rov ing 
the targeting o f social expenditures and safety net programs.

W h i l e the MDGs w e r e no t yet part o f the development agenda, m a n y o f the country 
development results to wh ich the C A S was f i r s t a l igned an t ic ipa ted them , o f ten with m o r e 

amb it ious targets. As shown in Table A, Bangladesh has focused consistently o n social and human 
development results. In addition t o con t ro l l ing population g row th effectively w i thou t resorting t o coercive 
measures, the country has endeavored t o reduce infant mortality, c h i l d malnutrition, and maternal 
mortality; expand access to education; and increase income-generation opportunities fo r women. During 

Among other issues, the Government had expressed disappointment with the expected level o f IDA lending under the low-case 
scenario, and the pressure to accelerate governance reforms. 
In addition to the Fifth F iveyear Development Plan (1997-2002), the CAS considered other o f f ic ia l documents that further 
described the country’s development strategy, including the Partnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction (PAPR) s i g n e d 
between the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on April 2000, and t h e Government’s Memorandum for 
the 2000 Bangladesh Development Forum. 
T h e Interim PRSP was completed in March 2003, and i t s implementation s ta r ted on July 1,2003 - t h e beginning o f the o f f ic ia l 
fiscal year in Bangladesh.

the CAS period, despite a global economic slowdown, the country maintained i t s good economic 
performance, and according to the latest projections, i t could achieve 5 . 5 percent GDP g row th in FY04. 
Given t h i s performance, i t i s likely that the positive trend in poverty reduction achieved in the 1990s 
continued in to 2004. In some areas such as ch i ld malnutrition, maternal mortality, and net primary 
enrollment, the country surpassed in 2001 the figures projected in the CAS fo r 2003. Progress toward the 
MDGs was significant, and fo r most indicators, Bangladesh i s o n target o r better w i t h regard t o achieving 
the goals. In fact, Bangladesh has already met the MDG target o f eliminating gender disparity in basic 
education wh i le making good progress towards the MDG o f p rov id ing un ive rsa l education.” 

15. 

As ref lected in the C A S Progress Repo r t , the I - PR S P fu r the r specifies the country 
development results sought by Bangladesh, wh ich have been exp l ic it ly l i n k e d to the MDGs but 

adap ted t o re f lec t country-specific aspirations. In the I-PRSP, Bangladesh continued to set challenging 
targets fo r itself, especially since the base year used was 2000 instead o f 1990 - the established 
benchmark o f the MDGs - wh i le 201 5 was maintained as t h e end year. T o accelerate progress and meet 
country targets, the I-PRSP was built upon five pillars, including imp rov ing governance, accelerating 
broad-based growth, investing in human development, promoting women’s advancement, and ensuring 
social protection.

C A S Outcomes 

T h e C A S was built a round th ree strategic objectives re levan t to country p r io r i t ies and 

16. 
development results. Specifically, the CAS aimed at helping Bangladesh to (i) accelerate broad-based 
growth; (ii) consolidate human development gains and address emerging challenges inc lud ing HIVIAIDS 
and arsenicosis; and (iii) implement an integrated approach t o ru ra l development. Linking these objectives 
was the CAS emphasis o n assisting the country in building stronger institutions and imp rov ing 
governance, and dealing w i t h crosscutting issues such as environmental management and gender. These 
objectives were c o n f i i e d in the FY03 CAS Progress Report, adjusted in light o f the renewed attention t o 
c r i t ica l areas fo r g row th such as infrastructure, power and ports. 

C A S Des ign and Imp lemen ta t ion Issues 

17. 

T h e F Y O l C A S made remov ing governance a n d o the r s t ruc tu ra l constraints affect ing 
g row th and pove r ty reduc t ion c r i t ica l to B a n k assistance. During CAS consultations in 2000, 

stakeholders repeatedly voiced as one o f their major concerns the very high cost imposed o n Bangladesh 
by poo r governance, especially by corruption, deteriorating law and order, and weak institutions.” The 
CAS recognized that tackling these issues i s a long-term endeavor that requires fundamental changes in 
the te rms o f po l i t ica l engagement and the power o f vested interests in the country. The CAS aimed at 
creating “a powe r fu l nexus fo r positive movement toward stronger, accountable institutions, improved 
governance and a greater voice fo r the people.” Translating t h i s broad goal in to specific results remains a 
challenge. 

18. 
Adap t ing t o Bangladesh’s po l i t ica l cycle, C A S objectives we re pu rsued th rough a 
performance-based assistance strategy unde rp inned by a two-phased approach . First, during the pre- 

election period and the settling in o f the new government, non-lending activities were given a prominent 
role wh i le lending continued under the l o w case. Second, once the country met the CAS performance 
triggers set fo r macroeconomic management, governance, reforms in key sectors, and po r t fo l io 
performance, lending moved in to the base case and was extended beyond projects with direct poverty

impact. Simultaneously, IFC took in to account the existing regulatory obstacles, uncertain economic 
prospects, and weak business environment prevalent in Bangladesh. As such, IFC focused on investment 
opportunities w i t h strong, reputable domestic or international sponsors, particularly in manufacturing and 
infrastructure. 

19. 

T h e gene ra l strategic app roach p roduced several positive results. By i n t e n s i f lm g analytical 

w o r k and responding in a t ime ly manner to o f f ic ia l requests fo r advice, the country team engaged the new 
government ve ry early on, establishing better Bank-government relations and imp rov ing p o l i c y dialogue, 
except in a few l ine ministries, most notably health. Specifically, the Bank prepared a series o f briefs 
covering macro-issues and sectoral priorities, and consolidated and expanded i t s analytical wo rk o n 
governance. At the government’s request, the Bank also prepared several unscheduled po l icy notes. In 
addition, analytical efforts p rov ided u s e f b l inputs fo r the preparation o f the national poverty reduction 
strategy - an in te r im version o f wh ich was completed during the CAS period - and fo r the de f in i t ion o f 
the new government’s re fo rm agenda. 

20. 
T h e lend ing strategy was cha rac te r ized by a two - t rack app roach distinguishing between k e y 
economic a n d in f ras t ruc tu re sectors a n d social sectors. Assistance t o the former required clear 

demonstration o f commitment t o reform, wh i le in the case o f t h e latter reforms were expected to go hand- 
in-hand w i t h Bank support. In l i n e w i t h the dominant institutional thinking and t h e prevalent perception 
o f Bangladesh as a “poor performer,” Bank involvement in sectors such as banking, power and water - 
whose progress was l inked t o the CAS triggers - required an acceptable roadmap fo r reform, credible 
leadership, and demonstrated commitment through progress on reforms related t o governance and 
structural issues. In social sectors such as health and education, on the other hand, assistance was 
provided without wa i t ing fo r reforms, due to t h e Bank’s commitment t o help Bangladesh protect and 
consolidate human development achievements and meet c r i t ica l poverty reduction needs. 

Severa l mechanisms f o r de l ive ry o f Bank assistance supported the lend ing strategy: 

21. 
p romo t ing private sector participation in key sectors and N G O service delivery in social sectors; 
supporting “islands o f excellence” in ru ra l infi-astructure and microcredit; and strengthening partnerships 
w i t h development partners.’* Accordingly, rather than lending in the financial sector, or in infrastructure 
development and gas production, the CAS emphasized IDA’S ro le in supporting policy, institutional and 
structural reforms to promote private participation. The objective was fo r IDA t o he lp remove po l icy and 
institutional constraints and fo r MIGA and IFC to facilitate investments t o increase private sector 
presence in these sectors. Moreover, IDA was no t expected to get invo lved in areas where the private 
sector or other donors had been engaged fo r long and/or had a comparative advantage. Siniultaneously, 
through several poverty-focused interventions, IDA lending was to be extended, as in the past, to several 
“islands o f excellence.” These included the Rural Electrification Boa rd and the successful ru ra l 
electricity cooperatives (Palli Bidyut S am i t i o r PBSs), PKSF (Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation) - an apex 
financing organization fo r microfinance, and the Loca l Government Engineering Department (LGED). 

22. 

A l though the ove ra l l app roach was sound, i t s imp lemen ta t ion was h inde red by the d i f f icu l t 

r e f o r m agenda unde r ly ing the CAS. The CAS triggers reflected the m ixed track record o f reforms in 
Bangladesh, the sequencing o f re fo rm actions that had worked in other developing countries, and the need 
t o deepen the re fo rm agenda. However, given the po l i t ica l economy and institutional constraints o f the 
country, making progress o n such a challenging agenda proved d i f f icu l t . The CAS expected that a new 
government, if committed to reforms, could manage to build consensus and overcome entrenched vested 
interests to initiate comprehensive reforms soon after coming in to office, and t o ma in ta in steady progress 
afterwards. In practice, the government succeeded in giving momentum to t h e re fo rm program in 2003 by

taking advantage o f opportunities fo r reform, but these varied across sectors. As should have been 
expected, re fo rm progress has thus been incremental and uneven. 

23. 

I n addition, the lend ing app roach to k e y economic a n d in f ras t ruc tu re sectors made it 
pa r t icu la r ly d i f f icu l t f o r the Bank to develop the country p r o g r am and to contr ibute to several C A S 

outcomes. N o t on ly Bank financial assistance, but also sector composition o f the lending program 
remained l im i ted fo r most o f the CAS period due t o t h e d i f f icu l ty faced by the government in meeting t h e 
key reforms required by the Bank. The lending approach also increased t h e challenge fo r Bank 
engagement, wh ich was constrained by the Bank’s withdrawal f r om supporting pub l ic investments in 
infrastructure sub-sectors where the private sector was expected to p lay a greater role. Moreover, during 
FY02 and FY03, governance concerns, especially corruption, and lack o f progress o n decentralization and 
municipal reform, further constrained lending assistance to sectors such as water and urban infrastructure. 
The resu l t was a d i f f icu l t and at times tense dialogue that translated in to repeatedly unsuccessful attempts 
to provide lending assistance as made ev iden t by the many projects in banking, power and water that were 
dropped between FYOO and FY03 . Many o f these projects had been in and out o f the pipeline several 
t im e s (see Section D and Table E fo r M e r details on the evolution o f the country program). As the 
CAS period advanced, the Country Team found i t s e l f increasingly constrained in i t s endeavor to be 
selective and to maximize the Bank’s comparative advantage wh i le developing a lending program 
relevant to CAS objectives and outcomes. 

24. 

I n the meant ime , Bank lend ing to hea l th a n d education cont inued a lthough r e f o rm progress 
in these sectors was re la t ive ly slow until recently, and several surveys inc luded these sectors among 

the most co r rup t in the coun t ry . Poor country ownership and lack o f good loca l fit resulted in slow 
implementation o f the reforms proposed fo r the health sector. By FY03, after about f ive years o f 
implementation o f the Hea l th and Population Sector Program w i t h support f rom a donor consortium l e d 
by the Bank, none o f the agreed reforms had been fully implemented, and people, including the poor, 
were increasingly purchasing health services f rom the largely unregulated, non-public sector. In 
education, according to Q A G and OED assessments, the Bank had m issed crucial opportunities to 
promote reforms to improve quality, especially through the two operations supporting increased access to 
g i r l s ’ education. 

25. 

T h e strategic app roach was reconsidered in the FY03 C A S Progress R e p o r t in light o f 
Bangladesh’s I -PRSP , a n d the emerg ing lessons f r o m C A S imp lemen ta t ion . Supported by the 

improvement in country performance and i t s mov ing in to the base-case scenario, t h e Bank initiated a s h i f t 
toward bo th increased engagement in c r i t ica l sectors and broad-based programmatic support. T h i s 
strategic shift was marked at the general leve l by emphasizing the opportunistic nature o f reforms in 
Bangladesh; and specifically by p rov id ing adjustment lending fo r t h e f i r s t t ime since the mid-l990s, 
complemented by a three-year Poverty Reduction and G row th Fac i l i ty (PRGF) arrangement f rom the 
IMF. As a result, F Y 0 4 became a transitional year characterized by intensified efforts to increase the 
levels o f Bank engagement in infrastructure in general and power in particular, and to support reforms in 
a more f l e x i b l e manner.

objective has been de r ived f o r t h i s repo r t . As generally happened across the Bank, monitoring progress 
was not sufficiently emphasized during CAS implementation. Keeping t h i s factor in mind, the progress 

92 

made in CAS outcomes and the Bank’s contribution are described below and detailed in Table A.I3 
W h i l e progress across most outcomes was generally good, i t ma in ly took place towards the end o f the 
CAS period. 

CAS Objective 1 : Accelerating Broad-based Economic G row th

U n d e r this objective, the B a n k p lanned to support efforts to imp rove the env ironment f o r 
p r i v a t e investment, and th rough I FC a n d MIGA, p romo te p r iva te investment in energy, 
in f ras t ruc tu re , manufactur ing , a n d services. Accordingly, the areas emphasized in the CAS included 
imp rov ing macroeconomic management; establishing an efficient fnanc ia l sector; furthering trade 
liberalization, export growth, and diversification; and removing infrastructure constraints. During the 
CAS period, the f i r s t three areas showed encouraging progress, although external factors affected export 
g row th in FYOl and FY02, including a global economic slowdown and deteriorating terms o f trade. 
Reducing infi-astructure constraints was the most challenging outcome partially because o f the scarcity o f 
pub l ic resources and t h e l ow response by private sector. T h e business environment deterred investors and 
kept their confidence low, wh ich in turn also affected t h e ab i l i ty o f IFC to make investments. In the 
meantime, however, IFC started t o address t h e needs o f smaller businesses through investments in t h e 
financial sector and technical assistance through the South Asia Enterprise Development Fac i l i ty (SEDF). 
Overall, the Bank contributed to t h i s CAS objective w i t h analytical wo rk and, fo r the f i r s t time since the

Mac roeconom ic management imp roved d u r i n g the C A S pe r iod . Macroeconomic stability was 
restored and sustained, and w i t h Bank and Fund assistance, a sound medium-term macroeconomic 
framework was developed. Good progress was achieved in the CAS outcomes relevant t o t h i s objective, 
inc lud ing imp rov ing quality o f pub l ic expenditure, increasing domestic resource mobilization, and 
alleviating the fiscal burden o f State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Several indicators help make t h i s 
progress clear: f rom 5.1 percent o f GDP in FYO1, the central government overall fiscal de f ic i t f e l l t o 3.5 
percent in FY03, reflecting improved revenue collection. Modernization o f the Na t iona l Boa rd o f 
Revenue (NBR) was initiated, wh ich w i l l help in the med ium t e r m t o deal w i t h administrative 
inefficiencies that currently hinder efforts to improve the poor tax-GDP ra t io o f the country. A new 
Privatization Po l icy was approved in 2002, but the ro le o f the Privatization Commission was no t properly 
defined. Nevertheless, net losses o f SOEs f e l l by more than h a l f between FYOl and FY03, and 
employment in SOE manufacturing was reduced by over 25 percent.I4 In FY04, increased po l i t ica l 
pressure and opposition to retrenchment in some areas led to the Government’s decision t o put o n h o l d 
the closure o r privatization o f manufacturing SOEs until after the 2006 elections. Partial retrenchment 
coupled with a freeze o n new recruitment fo r SOEs w i l l be implemented in the meantime. In addition t o 
the assistance provided through the Development Support Credit in FY03 and a second DSC (FY05), the 
Bank agreed to finance retroactively in F Y 0 4 and regularly through FY 0 6 a good po r t ion o f the voluntary 
retirement schemes ( VR S ) needed t o implement SOE restructuring. 

29. 
At the same time, Bang ladesh m a d e encourag ing progress towa rds establishing an eff ic ient 
f inanc ia l sector. This progress was reflected in tw o CAS outcomes, namely increasing the autonomy and 
regulatory capacity o f the Bangladesh Bank and imp rov ing the management o f Nationalized Commercial 
Banks (NCBs). The government, w i t h assistance f r om the Bank and the IMF, evaluated the strengths, 
potential vulnerabilities and key development opportunities o f the financial sector. Implementation o f the 
reforms identified as c r i t ica l to imp rov ing the sector gained momentum in FY03, and were supported 

l3 Measuring progress was l im i ted b y the lack o f baseline and recent data, and the d i f f icu l ty in observing significant changes in 
some o f the outcomes due to the shortness o f the CAS period. Establishing with confidence direct cause and effect between 
the Bank’s contribution and a specific outcome was also challenging given the relative size o f the country program v is -a -v is 
Bangladesh’s development needs, the presence o f many other actors, and the influence o f exogenous factors.

through the DSC and linked t o t h e Fund’s PRGF arrangement. Fo l low ing legal amendments that brought 
NCBs under the Bangladesh Bank’s supervision, institutional capacity building fo r the latter was started 
in FY 0 4 w i t h IDA financing and WB I support. A comprehensive strategy t o define resolution options for 
NCBs and address the existing stock o f non-performing loans was adopted in FY04 , along w i t h actions t o 
improve N C B management. I FC also contributed to financial sector outcomes though a guarantee for 
loca l currency financing to the leasing sector, wh i le continuing to support the largest private sector 
housing lender in the country. Furthermore, I FC and SEDF continued to promote the development o f 
loca l capital markets and a competitive banking sector in Bangladesh, w i t h specific emphasis o n 
increasing financing opportunities fo r small and medium enterprises. 

M a k i n g progress in t rade l ibe ra l iza t ion as we l l as export p romo t ion and d ivers if icat ion was 

30. 
d i f f icu l t . Among the relevant CAS outcomes, reducing anti-export bias in the trade regime advanced 
slowly, wh i le establishing a clear pos t -MFA strategy did no t receive sufficient attention. Although the 
Bank supported the modest progress made in overall tariff and customs reforms, Bank contribution to 
these outcomes was less than in i t ia l ly envisaged. Whereas average protection decreased f rom 27 percent 
to 22 percent in FY03, some reversal in trade liberalization actually took place in FY04 as non - ta r i f f 
measures tended to offset the effect o f lower custom duties. Bangladesh was considered then the most 
protected economy in South Asia, and the challenge was to continue trade liberalization wh i le reducing 
the country’s dependence o n impo r t taxes as a revenue source. A pos t -MFA strategy was prepared w i t h 
Bank assistance, but t h i s e f fo r t did not lead to concrete results. T h e IFC, however, established a trade 
enhancement fac i l i ty that operated as a risk sharing fac i l i ty between Standard Chartered Bangladesh, the 
Netherlands Development Corporation (FMO), and IFC . Despite some delays in u t i l iza t ion o f the fac i l i ty 
by the six participating private sector banks, the facility’s overall performance compared favorably w i t h 
IFC’s experience in other countries in terms o f bo th average u t i l iza t ion rate and return. 

Reduc ing in f ras t ruc tu re constraints continued to b e one o f the most c r i t ica l issues f o r 

31. 
accelerating Bangladesh’s development. Among the expected CAS outcomes, quality and coverage o f 
the transport sector increased and conditions in the telecommunications sector improved. With IDA- 
financed technical assistance, 
the capacity o f the Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory 
Commission (BTRC) was strengthened. Overall performance and competition o f the sector improved, 
although implementation o f a transparent inter-connection framework was s t i l l pending in FY04. With 
support f rom IFC, the country’s cellular network continued to expand. Telecommunication services in 
mal areas were specifically targeted through investments in GrameeriPhone that helped to expand the 
network and the successful V i l lage Phone Program. 

32. 

Progress was l im i t e d in t w o k e y CAS outcomes re la ted to in f ras t ruc tu re constraints, name ly 
enhancing ava i lab i l i ty a n d efficiency o f the energy sector and im p r o v i n g p o r t facilities. Between 

FYOl and FY04, the re l iab i l i ty o f t h e country’s electricity supply improved, systems losses experienced a 
sustained reduction f r om 35 t o 30 percent ( o f total generation), and revenue generation collection 
increased from 60 to 70 percent ( o f generated electricity). Bangladesh also made progress in rationalizing ‘ 
the distribution system as a good po r t ion o f the mal service areas were transferred, w i t h Bank assistance, 
f r om the Bangladesh Power Development Boa rd (BPDB) to the adjoining ru ra l electricity cooperatives 
(PBSs). Moreover, private sector participation in gas and electricity increased: in mid-2004, the private 
sector was responsible fo r over a fifth o f gas production and a third o f electricity generation. 
Nevertheless, power shortages and outages continued to impose substantial costs o n the economy, along 
w i t h inadequate access, poor quality, and high transaction cost o f services. O n l y 31 percent o f the 
population had access to electricity, wh i le inadequacy o f power supply continued t o be one o f the ma in 
obstacles to private investment in the country. Critically, inefficiencies in po r t operations remained 
unchanged due to d i f f icu l ty in in i t ia t ing reforms. 

94 

33 . 

R e f o r m in the energy sector advanced modestly. An Energy Regulatory Commission was 

established, based o n the 2003 ERC Act. T h e same year, an in te r im p r ic ing framework fo r electricity, gas 
and petroleum products was adopted in the country. However, energy price adjustments did no t advance 
beyond an i n i t i a l increase in residential urban t a r i f f s in September 2003, and an increase o f kerosene 
prices to parity w i t h diesel prices in M a y 2004. Due to specific concerns w i t h in f la t ion and i t s impact on 
the poor, the Government found i t d i f f icu l t to adjust national prices for gas and petroleum products. In 
turn, i t faced substantial financial costs because o f the national prices did not reflect rising global 
petroleum prices. 

34. 

Bank assistance f o r the public sector investments needed in powe r was low . B o t h a Power 

Sector Re fo rm APL and a Power Sector Technical Assistance Project - listed in the CAS as reserve 
operations - were dropped in FY02 after several years in the p ipe l ine without the country making the 
upfront reforms required fo r IDA assistance. In the interim, the Bank supported m a l electrification wh i le 
continuing t o help promote private sector participation. Specifically, the Bank contributed to the 
establishment o f Haripur (360 MW) and Meghnaghat (450 M Y ) independent power producers through an 
IDA pa r t ia l r i s k guarantee fo r the former and the on-lending o f IDA funds v i a I D C O L (a f i i a n c i a l 
intermediary) f o r t h e latter. At the same time, I F C supported the f i r s t independent power producer in 
Bangladesh through a B loan syndication (US$19 million), the largest to date in the country. 

CAS Obiective 2: Consolidating Human Developnient Gains 

35. 
T h e Bank expected to contr ibute d u r i n g FYO1-FY04 to strengthen the health, nu t r i t ion , a n d 
popu la t ion sector; and imp rove access and quality o f the education system in Bangladesh, wh i le 
he lp ing t o dea l w i t h emerg ing challenges such as H I V / A I D S and arsenicosis. During the CAS period, 

the country continued to m a k e gains in health indicators, wh ich compare favorably w i t h other countries o f 
similar income levels. In FYOl and FY02, consistent w i t h the low-case scenario, the Bank focused on 
health and education - despite governance concerns - in addition to ru ra l infi-astructure and microfinance, 
supporting sector reforms simultaneously w i t h the p rov is ion o f IDA h a n c i n g . Slow progress o n reforms 
dealing w i t h systemic problems such as quality o f service delivery and equity o f access affected overall 
sectoral impact o f Bank assistance. E f fo r ts to promote the ro le o f NGOs in health service delivery also 
faced bottlenecks and delayed implementation o f several c r i t ica l programs. 

36. 

Desp ite the shortcomings o f the sectorwide p rog ram , Bangladesh’s hea l th sector imp roved 

during the C A S pe r iod . Wh i le suffering f r om teething pains as a f i r s t generation sector-wide approach 
(SWAP) prepared in 1998, the Hea l th and Population Sector Program, supported by a donor consortium 
l e d by the Bank, helped imp rove coordination and development assistance t o the sector. M o r e concretely, 
the Program contributed to the related CAS outcomes, inc lud ing imp rov ing the capacity o f the Ministry 
o f Hea l th and Family Welfare; and increasing t h e leve l o f service quality and u t i l iza t ion at district and 
sub-district (thana) levels. I t also helped p r io r i t ize sector and targeted expenditures, especially o n 
programs that benefited children, women, and the poor. Over the med ium term, the Program helped 
improve several health indicators l inked to the MDGs, thus contributing t o better development impact o f 
health investments. Implementation o f the re fo rm agenda and program activities, however, advanced 
s low ly due to the devastating 1998 floods and the change o f government. M o r e directly related to 
program design and scale, there were i n i t i a l implementation demands that overwhelmed government and 
Bank capacity to deal w i t h financial management and procurement r n a t t e r ~ . ’ ~ 

37. 

Commun ity-based n u t r i t i o n p rog rams we re successfully piloted, but the i r scaling up f e l l 

short o f expectations. Implementation o f the IDA - f inanced Integrated N u t r i t i o n Program was successful, 
as corroborated by OED and an independent evaluation study. Bank contribution t o he lp ing the country 

T h e Program’s mid-term review identified procurement as the single most critical operational issue. 

95 

improve nu t r i t ion status by scaling up t h i s effort was affected by various factors. First, disagreements 
between the Bank and the Government delayed approval by the latter o f the national program, wh ich 
could no t take o f f until late FY03 - almost two years after Bank approval. Second, scaling up was decided 
before the lessons f rom the previous effort had been clearly assimilated. Results w i l l not be at t h e leve l 
i n i t i a l l y expected given that the program was scaled down, resulting in the cancellation o f about 25 
percent ( U S 2 5 m i l l ion ) o f IDA credit funds. 

38. 

Slow progress was made in establishing the capacity to p reven t H IV IA IDS and to respond 
to the arsenic crisis, a lthough the two IDA - f inanced pro jects dea l ing with these issues had been 
processed qu ick ly to p rov ide assistance in a t ime ly manne r . In bo th cases, t h i s lackluster record was 

due in part to project design issues and unsuitable implementation arrangements. The HIV/AIDS 
Prevention Project was approved in FYOl to take advantage o f the w indow o f opportunity provided by 
the l ow incidence o f HIV infections prevalent in Bangladesh. M e r a substantial delay, 
the project’s 
activities were scaled down in FY03 and about 55 percent o f IDA credit funds (US$22 m i l l ion ) cancelled. 
As a result, the expected impact o f the project has been substantially reduced. 

39 . 

Support to the country’s efforts t o deal w i t h the arsenic problem started in FY99 through 
analytical wo rk and the IDA - f inanced Arsenic M i t iga t ion Water Supply Project. The project’s design was 
particularly constrained by the fact that the size and extent o f the health problem was - and s t i l l i s - no t 
exactly known, wh i le n o credible treatment to deal w i t h arsenicosis was available. Progress was 
eventually made under the project in carrying out the emergency measures (i.e., screening tubewells, 
preparing community plans, etc.), but p rov id ing safe drinking water options proved more difficult. 
Implementation o f innovative p i lo ts t o establish piped-water schemes cou ld on ly be started in FY03, 
complemented by s i m i l a r efforts under the IDA-financed Social Investment Program. Planned Bank 
lending assistance to help address the pub l ic health aspects o f arsenicosis, o n the other hand, could not 
materialize due to different views between the Bank and the Government regarding the proposed project’s 
design and implementation arrangements. 

40. 
Bangladesh cont inued to m a k e progress in increas ing access to educat ion d u r i n g the F Y O 1 - 
04 per iod , but qua l i ty rema ins a m a j o r concern. With respect to CAS outcomes, steady progress was 
made in imp rov ing primary and secondary educational outcomes; imp rov ing qua l i ty o f teachers, 
curriculum, and textbooks; and in imp rov ing equity in education. This progress was achieved through the 
i n i t i a l implementation o f a medium-term sector re fo rm program, wh ich the Bank planned to support w i t h 
adjustment lending (FY05), and the extension o f the sectonvide approach to primary education 
development. Overall impact o f t h e Primary Education Development Project was affected by the fact that 
what was originally designed as a sector program became a set o f 25 discrete projects supported by 
different development partners, inc lud ing the Bank. Due to the lack o f implementation capacity, project 
coordination was not adequate, leading to disjointed interventions under many sub-components such as 
teacher training, curriculum development, and mon i to r ing and evaluation (M&E). Based o n the lessons 
learned, the second Primary Education Development Program was prepared in F Y 0 4 as a multi-donor 
assisted SWAP that helped advance harmonization efforts in the country. Add i t iona l progress in 
education-related CAS outcomes was achieved through the implementation o f the stipend and tu i t ion 
program to increase g i r l s ’ access to secondary education. During the f i r s t IDA - f inanced phase o f the 
program, completed in mid-2001, enrollment o f g i r l s in project schools more than doubled, g row ing f rom 
462,000 to 948,000. Although less than a third o f the g i r l s entering grade 10 passed the school leaving 
examination, t h e i r being enrolled l i k e l y resulted in delayed marriage, wh ich in time cou ld contribute t o 
lowe r ing the f e r t i l i t y rate.16 The second phase, also financed by IDA, aims at p rov id ing stipends to 1.45 

* 6 Although OED considered that project outcome as moderately satisfactory, both OED and QAG questioned some o f the project 
achievements due to inadequate attention to quality issues, l ow achievement levels in the Secondary School Certification 
(SCC) exams, and failure to target the stipends to the poorest segments o f the population. 

96 

m i l l i o n g i r l s . Contrastingly, projects to expand the p rov is ion o f post-literacy and continuing education 
had l im i ted results, despite assistance f rom the Bank and other development partners. The future o f these 
efforts became uncertain in F Y 0 4 w i t h the elimination o f the Directorate o f Non - fo rma l Education

CAS Obiective 3 : Implementing an Integrated Approach to Rural Develonment 

41. 

D u r i n g the CAS per iod , the B a n k p lanned to support Bangladesh's efforts to p romo te

and imp rove access to r u r a l in f ras t ruc tu re and social services. Ru ra l and agricultural g row th was not 

as impressive dwing the CAS pe r iod as i t was in the late 1990s. ARer a rap id g row th rate o f 5 percent per 
year throughout the second h a l f o f the 1990s, the agricultural sector suffered a deceleration that resulted 
in an annual average g row th o f around 2 percent during 2001-2003. Moreover, wage rates in the sector 
continued t o stagnate despite relatively healthy GDP growth. 

Bank con t r ibu t ion to r u r a l g row th did n o t have the impac t expected in the CAS. Ana ly t ica l 

42. 
wo rk o n the agriculture sector was completed in FY03, but was no t sufficiently disseminated, wh i le w o r k 
o n ru ra l non-faxm g row th was on ly completed in FY04. A l though a ru ra l development strategy was 
finalized in 2000, t h i s effort cou ld not be made operational through specific projects t o help promote rural 
growth. Bank support directed to agricultural diversification, at the same time, had m in ima l impact. As 
part o f Bank support to the latter, a small effort to promote horticulture exports was implemented, wh ich 
by de f in i t ion cou ld on ly provide modest results. A study o n agribusiness sponsored j o i n t l y by IDA and 
DFID did no t help iden t i fy any concrete interventions. T h e plan t o help finance an Agribusiness 
Development Project was subsequently abandoned. 

Progress towa rds im p r o v i n g ag r icu l tu ra l research and extension and wa te r management 

43. 
capacity was slow. IDA - f inanced efforts to improve research and extension and strengthen their links did 
no t have t h e expected impact. Modest progress was made in rationalizing extension services throughout 
the cowitry. In addition, some progress was made in imp rov ing the operation o f ind iv idua l agricultural 
research institutes in terms o f program prioritization, adoption o f a fanning systems approach, and 
fo l low ing up a research g r a n t s scheme. O n the other hand, the institutional weaknesses o f the Bangladesh 
Ag r icu l tu ra l Research Counc i l (BARC) - particularly in areas such as research p o l i c y development, and 
research financing and budgeting - were no t adequately addressed, and as a r e s u l t the overall efficiency 
o f the national research system remained low . The plan to continue imp rov ing water resource 
management capacity suffered delays, as Bank financial support t o the water sector was put o n h o l d in 
FY 0 2 by regional management due to governance concerns. Nevertheless, progress was made in building 
capacity in the Water Resource Planning Organization (WARPO) and in restructuring the Bangladesh 
Water Development Boa rd (BWDB), two key sector agencies. In addition, the Na t iona l Water 
Management Plan, completed w i t h Bank assistance, was approved in M a r c h 2004 - a major 
accomplishment considering that two past attempts to develop t h i s plan had failed due to entrenched 
opposition. l8 

E f fo r ts to m a k e opportun it ies and assets ava i lab le to the poo r p roduced good results. 

44. 
Progress was made in most o f the expected outcomes, although in different degrees: increasing access to 
nlicrocredit continued successfully, positive steps t o improve t h e efficiency and effectiveness o f social 
safety nets were implemented, and assessing whether these p rov ide a be t te r alternative i s ongoing. In 
contrast, increasing access to safe drinking water proved t o be a more d i f f icu l t task, although rap id 

l7 T h e Government, NGOs, and development partners have since started to work together to develop a National Framework for 
Non-formal Education. 
'' Bu i ld ing on these achievements, IDA assistance w i l l be provided in FY05 to improve water management capacity. 

97 

progress was made starting in late FY03 (see above). The f i s t IDA-fmanced microfinance project, 
completed during the CAS period, exceeded i t s target o f total borrowers by 75 percent, reaching 2.1 
m i l l i o n people (90 percent o f wh ich were women), wh i le strengthening the institutional capacity o f 
PKSF, the apex agency fo r the sector. Scaling up efforts continued through a second IDA - f inanced 
microfinance operation, and through a Lend ing and Innovation Credit to tes t alternative delivery models 
to extend microfmance services to the poorest, hardest-to-reach households. E f fo r ts to increase income 
opportunities fo r the poor through f isher ies , s i l k development and high-value horticulture produce - a l l o f 
wh ich were actively supported by the Bank and other donors - were no t as successful. 

Access to r u r a l in f ras t ruc tu re cont inued to expand du r ing the C A S pe r iod . This expansion 

45. 
was achieved through investments, consistently financed by the Bank, in ru ra l roads, rural markets, and 
electrification; and by p i lo t ing community-driven approaches to deliver social services and infrastructure 
assets to the poor. Disaster vulnerability was further reduced through the expansion and rehabilitation o f 
riverbank protection works and coastal embankments, as we l l as through implementation o f cyclone 
m i t iga t ion measures. Rehabilitation o f polders, at the same t ime , helped increase agricultural production 
in the targeted areas. Independent evaluations show that IDA-financed ru ra l roads and markets projects 
helped increase the marketing o f agricultural products and the revenues o f fa rme rs w i t h improved access, 
wh i le also helping to diversify the non-agricultural employment opportunities o f land-poor households 
and to generate employment fo r destitute women. 

General CAS Objective: Imp rov ing Governance and Strengthening Institutions 

46. 
Governance imp rovemen t was a t the core o f the B a n k strategy, but progress on t h i s b r o a d 
objective was slow and the impac t o f B a n k efforts modest. As mentioned earlier, at the sector leve l the 

Bank promoted the establishment o f regulatory entities in energy and telecommunications, wh i le 
p romo t ing institutional reforms in banking and the water sector. A t the general leve l , the Bank expected 
t o promote anti-corruption measures and legal and jud ic ia l reform; and t o help initiate public 
administration re fo rm as w e l l as decentralization and loca l capacity building. 

Severa l ant i-corrupt ion measures we re in it iated , but the i r impac t will on ly become evident 

47. 
in the m e d i um to long te rm . Legislation to establish the Anti-Corruption Commission was approved by 
Parliament in February 2004. The Commission, however, was not operative and the Anti-Corruption 
Strategy was incomplete at t h e end o f the CAS period. The process o f separation o f the jud ic ia ry and 
executive advanced s low ly due to the complexity o f t h e task at hand.Ig 

48. 

As w i t h the previous CAS , pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion re fo rms we re among the most challenging 
to imp lemen t as these did no t f igu re p rom inen t ly in the government’s agenda. m e r several years in 

preparation, a public sector modernization program to be financed by the Bank - considered a key 
element o f the CAS program - was dropped f r om the pipeline in FY02. In FY03, modest steps included 
in the Development Support Credit to change staff p romo t ion r u l e s were implemented, along w i t h a hiring 
freeze fo r t h e lower levels o f the c i v i l service. These actions notwithstanding, at the end o f the CAS 
period pub l ic administration remained rigid and no t very efficient, representing one o f the m a i n obstacles 
t o smooth implementation o f development programs and projects. In consequence, delivery o f Bank 
assistance continued to be constrained by c i v i l service d e s , po l i t ic iza t ion o f t h e bureaucracy, and the 
short tenures o f senior bureaucrats. 

In contrast, pub l ic f inanc ia l managemen t and p rocu remen t capac ity imp roved in recent 

49. 
years. With additional support f r om development partners, several o f the recommendations o f the 

l 9 The Judicial Services Commission was formed. However, the status o f magistrates remained unresolved, as they wou ld prefer 
to remain under the c i v i l service administration. 

98 

Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) were implemented, including, among others, the 
separation o f the audit and accounting functions, and the establishment o f in tema l audit committees in 
selected ministries and autonomous agencies. At the same time, fo l low ing the recommendations o f the 
Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), a Central Procurement Technical Unit was 
established, a Procurement L a w was drafted, and public procurement regulations issued t o change the o l d 
sys tem completely. In addition to the analytical work, IDA - f inanced technical assistance was instrumental 
in achieving t h i s progress. 

50. 
Modes t steps we re m a d e to imp rove the c i v i l jud ic ia l system and increase access to justice. 
Implementation o f the jud ic ia l re fo rm program supported by IDA and other donors helped initiate reforms 
in t h e Supreme Court and selected district courts. During the CAS period, Money Loan Courts fo r 
financial disputes and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanism (ADR) were established. 

51. 
On the o the r hand, in FY04 the structure a n d plan f o r decentra l izat ion rema ined unc lear . 
Bank efforts t o promote decentralization issues did no t produce any concrete results, despite the 
Government’s professed intention o f establishing strong loca l government at various levels. In the end, 
the p i lo t effort t o test models o f decentralization listed as a reserve project in the CAS could no t 
materialize. 

Crosscutting; Issues: Addressing Social and Environmental Issues 

52. 
Env i ronmen ta l management capacity did no t imp rove d u r i n g the CAS pe r iod . To help build 
t h i s capacity, the Bank planned to support alleviation o f air po l lu t ion in Dhaka, execute the po l icy 
coniponent o f the UNDP-assisted Sustainable Environmental Management Program (SEMP), and 
promote better environmental assessment procedures across a l l Government l ine agencies. Bangladesh 
made progress in imp rov ing the forest management system w i t h Bank assistance, wh ich also helped 
expand mangrove plantations w i t h community participation. A l lev ia t ion o f urban a i r po l lu t ion in Dhaka 
was an area o f relative success t o wh ich the Bank also contributed directly. A f te r the removal o f the two - 
stroke three wheelers, the next challenge to address i s the influx o f diesel commercial vehicles. In 2002, 
however, the Bank had t o withdraw f r om SEW due to disagreement between the Ministry o f 
Environment and Forestry (MOED) and UNDP, and t h e Bank’s concerns w i t h governance in t h e sector. 
M o r e positively, a Country Environmental Analysis was initiated in FY 0 4 w i t h Bank and other 
development partners’ support t o help strengthen the environmental foundation o f t h e PRSP. 

53. 
T h e gender equ ity agenda rema ins substantial, even though Bang ladesh made f u r t h e r 
progress in girls’ education, m icrof inance , and expansion o f income generat ion opportun it ies f o r 
women . Partially due t o achievements in these areas, the country met the MDG in gender equality in 
primary and secondary enrolment. Health and nu t r i t ion p r o g r a m implemented w i t h IDA financing 
effectively targeted women and their children. The Government recognized the importance o f p romo t ing 
women’s advancement by making this one o f the f i v e pillars o f the I-PRSP. Currently, gender inequalities 
persist in accessing and con t ro l l ing resources and in taking advantage o f economic opportunities. 
A l though tougher laws were recently enacted against th row ing ac id o n women, Bangladesh s t i l l has a 
high incidence o f violence against women. 

54. 
CAS imp lemen ta t ion did no t generate any substantial negat ive social and env i ronmen ta l

Overall Assessment o f CAS Performance 

5 5 . 
Based o n the analysis o f outcome progress, C A S pe r fo rmance i s considered ma rg ina l ly 
satisfactory, wh i le the ove ra l l impac t o f Bank assistance rema ined modest. In general, Bank 

assistance contributed to development progress in Bangladesh during t h e CAS period, but no t at t h e 
expected levels. The Bank supported more effectively the objective o f consolidating human development 
gains, fo l lowed by accelerating broad-based growth. Assistance t o improve governance was less 
successful, but the Bank helped to initiate important s teps toward imp rov ing the regulatory framework in 
telecommunications and energy, in i t ia t ing institutional change in the water sector, strengthening fiduciary 
systems, and developing anti-corruption measures.

o f Bank support was no t fully evident yet, since the re fo rm program was in t h e early stages o f 
implementation in FY04.

As shown in Section D, the lend ing p r o g r am evolved w i thou t a complete understand ing o f 
the impac t o f p r o g r am changes o n C A S outcomes. Some o f these outcomes seem ambitious in 

retrospective, particularly i f the prevalent country and institutional conditions are taken in to 
consideration. Consequently, the Bank’s contribution to several CAS outcomes was lower than expected, 
particularly in outcomes related t o p romo t ing agricultural g row th and diversification, reducing 
infrastnxcture constraints, 
imp rov ing pub l ic administration, and supporting 
loca l government 
strengthening. 

58 . 
In addition, C A S pe r fo rmance was affected by the Bank ’s d i f f icu l ty in engaging the 
government in c r i t ica l areas such as pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion r e f o rm a n d decentra l izat ion . B o t h o f 

these areas were prominently discussed in the FYOl CAS document, but lacked country ownership and 
better understanding o f re fo rm constraints.

De l ive ry - Bank Assistance d u r i n g the C A S Pe r iod 

61. 
T h e lend ing p r o g r am inc luded in the FYOl C A S p roved to b e ve ry tentative, wh i le l im i ted 
to investment and techn ica l assistance credits (see Table B fo r details). The l i s t o f dropped projects 
presented in Table D shows the difficulties faced b y the Country Team in in i t ia t ing o r maintaining Bank 
involvement in sectors such as urban infrastructure, ports, banking, energy, water, and especially 
agriculture.21 In FYOO, during CAS preparation, n i n e projects were dropped f rom the po r t fo l io . Eight 
projects were dropped in each o f t h e two subsequent fiscal years. By FY03, the pipeline had become thin 
and identification o f viable projects increasingly challenging. The program continued to change during 
FY 0 4 as the Bank attempted to respond to I-PRSP priorities and to IDA 13 resource constraints. Despite 
these efforts, the array o f i n s t r um e n t s available to deliver Bank financial support remained quite limited. 
The intention noted in t h e CAS o f using sector wide approaches beyond the health sector on ly became 
possible in FY 0 4 through the second phase o f the primary education development program. Adjustment 
lending cou ld on ly be provided in FY03, when Bangladesh f ina l ly moved in to the base case. 

62. 
A disconnect can b e observed between the lend ing and non lend ing p rog rams . Ana ly t ica l and 
advisory activities (AAA) were fo r the most part delivered as listed in the CAS. In FY04, however, AAA 
delivery slowed down significantly (see Table C). In general, AAA delivery was advanced without 
adjusting to the changes in the lending program. This situation stemmed, t o some extent, f rom t h e 
strategic decision to focus the nonlending program o n overall governance, poverty and re fo rm issues, 
rather than on supporting lending development through formal sector work. With the exception o f the 
agricultural and non-farm ru ra l sectors, health, and to a lesser degree education, formal sector wo rk was 
minimal during the CAS period. 

63. 
Desp ite the w ide a r r a y o f C A S outcomes, most o f the comm itments made between FYO1-04 
we re concentrated on a few sectors, resu l t ing in an active po r t fo l io dom ina ted b y transportat ion , 
health, energy a n d education. Among the 19 investment and technical assistance projects approved 
during the CAS period, ru ra l infrastructure, represented in ru ra l roads and electrification projects, 
received the largest amount o f new IDA commitments (US$381 m i l l ion ) . This type o f projects was 
fo l lowed closely by education projects, wh ich received US$375 m i l l ion . Together, these two set o f 
projects received 45 percent o f FY01-04 IDA commitments. SOE and banking re fo rm received the third 
largest amount (US$287 m i l l ion , or close t o 17 percent o f total), wh i le support t o scaling-up microfinance 
was next (US$156 m i l l i o n or 9 percent o f total)?2 This pattern, combined with the fact that 16 projects 
closed and six projects were extended, contributed to t h e concentration o f the po r t fo l io in transportation, 
health, energy - including ru ra l electrification and support to increasing private sector provision,23 and the 
education sector. 

64. 
De l ive ry o f Bank assistance was h inde red by the l im i t e d access to I D A resources 
experienced by Bangladesh. T h e country cou ld on ly access about 80 percent (US$1.15 b i l l ion ) o f i t s 
FY1-03 IDA allocation as i t continued in the low-case scenario fo r the f i r s t two years o f the CAS period. 
In addition, recent analysis indicates that the country performance rating, and by extension the IDA 
allocation fo r Bangladesh, may have been further reduced due to the formula, and particularly the 
governance factor, applied t o estimate t h i s rating. Significantly, when the country moved to t h e base case 
in FY03, the lending target o f US$715 m i l l i o n set in the CAS could no t be met, pa r t ia l ly because o f the 

21 Financial support to the water sector, for example, was supposed to reach over 30 percent o f the i n i t i a l FYOI-03 lending 
program, but never materialized due to the factors previously mentioned. Public power sector investment credits (Le., Power 
Sector Technical Assistance and Power Sector I 1 - Dispatch and Transmission) included in t h e “reserve l i s t ” could not come 
to fru i t ion either, pending actual reforms. 
22 Commitments for health projects only reached US$40 m i l l ion ( for H IV /A IDS prevention) due t o the delay in preparing the 
second phase o f the SWAP and the decision to drop the Arsenic Public Health Project

thin pipeline. Despite these problems, Bangladesh remained among the t e n largest recipients o f IDA 
resources during the CAS period, and in FY03 was in fact the larges t IDA - o n l y recipient and second 
overall afier India. 

65. 
I n add it ion , most I D A resources were comm i t ted la te in the C A S pe r iod . Almost half o f total 
FY01-03 commitments were approved in the last quarter o f FY03, and most o f the FY 0 4 commitments 
were scheduled fo r June. In fact, the adjustment lending provided in FY03 i s equivalent to over 50 
percent o f that year’s commitments and over 17 percent o f total FYO1-04 commitments. T h e adjustment 
support (US$300 m i l l ion ) planned fo r FY 0 4 slipped in to the f i r s t quarter o f FY05. As shown earlier, 
however, t h e re fo rm measures supported by these adjustment credits helped advance CAS outcomes in 
FY04 . 

66. 
Simultaneously, disbursements experienced a serious slowdown, ref lect ing slow p ro jec t 
imp lemen ta t ion . Over 50 percent o f FY01-03 to ta l disbursements took place in FY03 t h a n k s to the 
provision o f one-tranche adjustment support. That year, at the same time, disbursements related to 
investment and TA projects were down by almost 20 percent w i t h respect to the average fo r the two 
previous fiscal years. T h i s trend is also evident in the country’s disbursement ratio (net o f adjustment 
lending), which, after reaching l e v e l s o f 20 percent or more in FYO1 and FY02, decreased to 16.4 percent 
in FY03 and stayed at almost t h e same l e v e l in FY04. At the end o f the latter, total gross and net 
disbursements (US$228 m i l l i o n and US$98 m i l l ion , respectively) fo r the year had reached unprecedented 
l o w levels, reflecting a larger pattern o f very l ow u t i l iza t ion o f project a id by B a n g l a d e ~ h . ~ ~ 

67, 
C r e d i t fund cancellations also increased, m a i n l y because o f the need to res t ruc tu re p rob lem 
pro jects . In total, about US$220.0 m i l l i o n in IDA funds, equivalent to 19 percent o f FY01-03 
commitments, were cancelled during the same peri0d.2~ Mos t o f the cancellations (US$152.9 m i l l i o n or 
almost 70 percent o f total fo r the period) took place in FY03, and affected several projects that were 
c r i t ica l to achieving CAS outcomes. These included H IV /A IDS Prevention (50 percent o f credit 
cancelled); S i l k Development P i lo t Project (45 percent); Dhaka Urban Transport (37 percent); 26 Primary 
Education Development (30 percent); Fou r th Fisheries (30 percent); Fourth Dhaka Water Supply (30 
percent); and Na t iona l N u t r i t i o n (25 percent). 

Po r t fo l io Assessment 

68. 
IDA Po r t fo l io pe r fo rmance was unsatisfactory d u r i n g most o f the C A S pe r iod . I FC 
po r t fo l io pe r fo rmance was satisfactory, with non -pe r fo rm ing loans be low the I FC no rm . The FYO1 
CAS recognized that po r t fo l io performance had been below the Bank’s average. Between FYOl and 
FY04, despite temporary improvements in some indicators, the po r t fo l io continued to deteriorate. In 
FY03, Bangladesh experienced the worst po r t fo l io conditions o f recent years as the share o f projects at 
risk climbed t o 24 percent and commitments at risk t o 33 percent.27 During F Y 0 4 the po r t fo l io improved 
slightly, and in June 2004 the percentage o f projects at risk was 17 and the percent o f commitments at risk 

24 Between FYOl and FY04, total gross disbursements in Bangladesh reached US$1.4 b i l l ion and net disbursements US$972.6 
m i l l ion ( o f which 69 percent corresponded to investment and TA credits.) 
25 About 84 percent o f cancellations were due to project restructuring and cost savings, 14 percent due to undisbursed balances at 
credit closing, and 2 percent due to misprocurement. 
26 W i th cancellations amounting to US$64.8 million, Dhaka Urban Transport, a problem project fo r over two years due to over- 
ambitious design and poor institutional knowledge, was the project with the largest share o f total cancelled funds in FY03 
(42.4 percent) and overall during t h e period (29.4 percent). 
27 In comparison, FY03 Bank average for both projects at r i s k and commitments at r i s k was 15 percent, while the regional figures 
were 17 and 14 percent, respectively.

T h e above t r e n d p a r t i a l l y ref lected the strategic decision to extend several pro jects a t r i s k , 
most o f t h em ac tua l p rob lem projects, a n d o r to postpone p a r t i a l cred it cancellations o n the basis o f 
the expected development im p a c t a n d con t r ibu t ion to CAS outcomes. W h i l e the actual imp l ica t ion fo r 

Bank development effectiveness has no t been fully evaluated yet, the l i s t o f extensions during the CAS 
pe r iod includes, in addition t o PSIDP, other key projects such as Arsenic M i t iga t ion Water Supply, Dhaka 
Urban Transport, and the Hea l th and Population Sector Program. Before be ing upgraded during FY04, 
m y of these projects were considered p rob lem projects fo r a considerable pe r iod o f time (Arsenic 
M i t iga t ion fo r almost two years and Dhaka Urban transport fo r over two years), thus affecting po r t fo l io 
indicators substantially during the CAS period. Mos t o f these projects suffered f r om the general design 
and related implementation problems discussed below. 

70. 

In add i t ion to design issues, po r t fo l io conditions also ref lected slow p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion 
due to d i f f icu l t adm in is t ra t ive procedures and processes. Some o f the most serious issues relate to 

delays in appointing key staff, protracted consultant recruitment, inc lud ing NGO contracting, and weak 
procurement and financial management capacity. Although i t i s expected that implementation o f the 
procurement re fo rm program w i l l help improve t h i s situation, during the CAS pe r iod recruitment o f 
consultants and awarding o f contracts continued to be affected by undue delays in the evaluation and 
procurement approval process, unrealistic procurement schedules, tendency among implementation u n i t s 
to re-bid, and the lack o f standardized bidding documents. Protracted government approval o f the Project 
Concept Paper (PCP) and Project Proforma (PP) further delayed projects.

economy. Q A G  assessment^^^ consistently iden t i fy lack o f c la r i ty and realism o f project development 
objectives as one o f the weakest areas in project design, wh ich i s , at the same time, found t o be generally 
weak. Several projects considered to be “best practice” faced serious problems because institutional and 
po l i t ica l challenges were not w e l l understood, and implementation arrangements a n d o r capacity did not 
correspond to country conditions. As a result, proposed p o l i c y and institutional reforms were often 
integrated in to projects w i thou t sufficient client ownership ando r understanding o f implementation 
constraints. 

72. 
Bank p ro jec t supervision was affected by the qua l i ty and rea l ism o f repo r t ing , a n d 
insuff ic ient focus on deve lopment effectiveness. O n the one hand, over-ambitious mon i to r ing and 

evaluation (M&E) systems were proposed w i thou t a realistic implementation plan and l i t t l e o r no fo l low 
up during implementation. On the other hand, an overemphasis o n project inputs and disbursements, 
rather than o n outputs and outcomes, resulted in an inadequate measurement o f development impact. 
According t o QAG, supervision ratings tend t o be generous in the case o f Bangladesh, wh ich would 
imply that po r t fo l io quality i s worse than reported. 

” In addition to PSIDP, the l i s t o f problem projects in June 2004 included Mun ic ipa l Services, Microfinance 11, Post-Literacy and 
Continuing Education, and Fourth Fisheries. 
29 Q AG data at the country level should be analyzed cautiously given the small size o f some o f the samples. Dur ing the CAS 
period, QAG assessed quality at entry (QAE) o f f ive projects and quality o f supervision (QSA) of 1 1 projects in Bangladesh. 
The QSA in FYOl focused on “risky projects” and i s not comparable with the other years. Both QAE and QSA were found to 
be generally satisfactory, although in the latter case Bangladesh did not perform as we l l as t h e region or the Bank as a whole. 
To identify trends better, we also considered for t h i s report a longer period, starting in FY97. T h i s brings the sample up to 12 
projects assessed for QAE and 22 for QSA (although three projects are included twice in t h i s sample).

73. 

As a result, the effectiveness a n d impac t o f B a n k lend ing has been mixed: wh i le 
achievement o f p ro jec t outcomes was mostly satisfactory, sustainability fe l l beh ind B a n k averages 

du r ing the C A S pe r iod . Ou t o f 18 projects evaluated between FYOO and FY04, OED agreed that 14 
(about 78 percent) had satisfactory outcomes. Sustainability o f project benefits was considered likely, 
however, in on ly 10 o f these projects (about 63 percent). Bangladesh’s share o f satisfactory project 
outcomes compares we l l w i t h the region (81 percent) and the Bank as a whole (76 percent). In contrast, in 
t e r n o f sustainability, Bangladesh performed below the region (81 percent) and Bank levels (73 percent). 
See Table D(a) fo r details o f OED ratings by closed project. 

Ins t i tu t iona l development impac t - a n ove r r id ing concern o f the C A S - was modest. 

74. 
According to OED, on ly a third o f the evaluated projects in Bangladesh had substantial institutional 
development impact. T h i s f i g u r e i s substantially below the region (46.2 percent) and Bank (49 .9 percent) 
levels, wh ich were generally l o w in the f i r s t place. Overall, excepting the “ is lands o f excellence” in 
microfinance (PKSF), ru ra l infrastructure (LGED) and ru ra l electrification (REB), the Bank’s efforts t o 
help build good sector institutions in the country continued to be largely disappointing during the CAS 
period.30 I t should be noted that in the case o f PKSF, LGED, and REB, Bank support for capacity 
building built o n the successful efforts o f other development partners.

infrastructure has provided clear benefits, and that over time the Bank has built a beneficial development 
partnership w i t h government in the rural electricity and transport sectors. Contrastingly, support to 
agricultural research and extension services did not resu l t in sustainable, v is ib le impacts: sustainability o f 
the Ag r icu l tu ra l Research Management Project was rated as unlikely by OED, while that of the 
Agricultural Support Services Project could no t be evaluated due to “significant uncertainties about the

sectors. In the case o f the gas sector, overall institutional capacity o f Petrobangla remained poor and i t s

wh ich closed in FYOO w i t h unsatisfactory ratings, was the fourth and last IDA credit to t h e sector. T h e 
Fourth Dhaka Water Supply, the last in a succession o f Bank-supported efforts was unsatisfactory at most 
levels, and considered by Q A G a “no-win project f rom entry.” These tw o projects failed largely because 
o f lack o f po l i t ica l w i l l to undertake deep systemic reforms needed in the sector, but also because o f poor 
country ownership and unrealistic expectations. In the case o f Dhaka Water, additional factors were 
unrealistic development objectives and poor des ign and appraisal that ignored the lessons o f the three 

previous  operation^.^'

31 QAG recommended, however, that fu tu re support to the urban water supply sector should be given only i f the Bank can obtain 
up-front sector reform and municipal reform addressing the systemic issues that hinder the provision o f water and other public 
services in the country. 
32 OED concluded that the sustainability o f the program included in the DSC was non-evaluable due to similar reasons.

and the Bank participated actively in i t s completion, wh i le key stakeholders had no t been consulted. Q A G 
thus concluded that the three-year re fo rm program proposed in the DSC did no t reflect a realistic analysis 
o f institutional constraints and implementation capacity, wh ich made i t un l ike ly that the program could be 
fo l lowed through completely.

O v e r a l l qua l i ty o f ana ly t ica l a n d adv isory activities d u r i n g the C A S pe r iod was satisfactory 
accord ing to QAG, but the i r effectiveness, a lthough encouraging, was somewhat l im i ted?3 In 

general, Q A G commended the Bank approach o f coordinated analytical wo rk and po l icy advocacy on 
govemance pursued especially in FYOl and FY02.34 In addition, Q A G considered the strong poverty 
focus o f AAA very productive. Specifically, the C F A A was rated by Q A G as highly satisfactory wh i le 
the Poverty Assessment was rated as fully satisfactory. The decision to prepare the Public Expenditure 
Review (PER) in parallel to the Poverty Assessment allowed the Bank and the Government to take 
advantage o f the complementarities between these efforts, wh ich provided u s e f u l inputs t o the I-PRSP 
and helped i n f o rm the dialogue on poverty reduction in Bangladesh. Additionally, thanks t o the close 
collaboration with the Bangladesh Bureau o f Statistics (BBS), the methodology used in the country to 
measure poverty improved substantially. M o r e generally, however, analytical wo rk did no t help enhance 
the impact o f Bank-financed projects, to a great extent because o f the disconnect that developed between 
the lending and non-lending programs. The overall impact o f governance-related w o r k was l im i ted by the 
d i f f icu l ty in translating the knowledge gained in to concrete ways t o deal w i t h deep systemic issues, 
particularly at t h e project and sector levels. T h i s d i f f icu l ty was related, t o some extent, to the need to 
address better the po l i t ica l economy o f reforms.

T h e C A S was p repa red fo l low ing consultations w i t h a w ide a r r a y o f stakeholders across the

nevertheless constrained by the po l i t ica l situation, wh ich made i t d i f f icu l t t o get attention f r om opposition 
parties, and by strained relations with the government. Due t o t i n i e constraints, t h e CAS Progress Report 
did no t benefit f r om consultation w i t h stakeholders, although i t s draft was shared w i t h government and 
several development partners. A s planned in the CAS, during the pre-election and government transition 
periods, the Bank used donor meetings, interactions w i t h c i v i l society, and occasionally the media to

maintained at the expected levels afterwards.

Pa r tne rsh ip with government imp roved a f te r the elections, but a negat ive pe rcep t ion o f the 

Bank l inge red throughout the CAS pe r iod . According to the G loba l P o l l conducted in FY03, t h e Bank 
in Bangladesh was perceived as arrogant, o f ten acting bo th “irresponsibly” by proposing utlsustainable 
advice, and inconsistently by no t always fo l low ing 
T h i s perception was corroborated t o some

the increased emphasis g iven t o governance since the mid 1990s, starting with “Government that Works.” 
Wh i le many Bangladeshis have welcomed t h i s focus, others remain ambivalent or resent the “rhetoric” o f

in rea l i ty often dogmatic solutions 
indiscriminately and without sufficient understanding o f the Bangladeshi context. Such tendencies on the 
part o f the Bank were reinforced by the generalized perception o f the country as a “poor performer.”

T h e effectiveness o f the L o c a l Consu ltat ive G r o u p (LCG), cha i red b y the Bank , increased 

du r ing the C A S pe r iod . When the CAS was being prepared, government’s involvement in t h e activities 
o f t h e L C G remained limited. Moreover, the Bank and other major donors had on ly recently started their 
efforts to bring development assistance under a common development framework and t o focus on 
results.36 During CAS implementation, ownership o f the L C G was expanded through the establishment 
o f an Executive Committee w i t h rotating membership, wh i le t h e government’s participation in L C G 
activities increased. Presently, senior officials meet periodically with the full LCG, wh i le officials f rom 
the l i n e m i n i s t r i e s mee t regularly w i t h their counterparts in L C G sub-groups. In Jan~m ry 2003 the 
government and L C G started the Aid Governance In i t ia t ive to strengthen the quality o f administrative and 
implementing processes o f externally-funded development activities in Bangladesh. Donors and 
government officials worked together o n four groups dealing w i t h audits, procurement, training, and 
simplification o f project documents. 

82. 
Increased co l laborat ion with development pa r tne rs in lending, especially th rough SWAPS , 
and ana ly t ica l wo rk , enhanced development effectiveness. W h i l e coordination in some sectors 

remained weak, partnerships in health and primary education were particularly strengthened through 
sector-wide approaches. In health, bo th the Government and the donor consortium led by the Bank 
learned to wo rk better together through the challenging implementation process o f the f i r s t sector wide 
approach. T h e Primary Education Program, wh ich closed in FY04, suffered f rom lack o f binding donor 
coordination and borrower commitment. In contrast, i t s new phase represents a good example o f donor 
harmonization and partnership w i t h the government. Based o n past experience, a Code o f Conduct was 
also agreed upon among participant donors to ensure decision making by consensus and a common voice. 

83. 
T h e need f o r a c lear lega l f r am ew o r k emerged d u r i n g C A S imp lemen ta t ion as a cen t ra l 
issue to ensure NGO independence a n d accountability. Government and development partners, such as 

the Bank, continued t o support NGO efforts to expand access to microfinance. NGOs also played a ro le in 
non-formal education, inc lud ing literacy work, and in delivering health services. However, delays in 
engaging NGOs affected several c r i t ica l projects such as Na t iona l Nu t r i t ion and H IV /A IDS Prevention. 
In FY04, the Government introduced in the Parliament, but qu ick ly withdrew after donor urging, a N G O 
Bill restricting N G O autonomy and operational flexibility in response t o alleged po l i t ica l partisanship o f 
several NGOs and concerns w i t h money laundering.37 W h i l e there i s a broad consensus among NGOs and 
donors that an enabling lega l li-amework should be put in place to improve internal governance and 
accountability o f the N G O sector, i t i s also agreed that t h i s should b e done through consultations w i t h a l l 
stakeholders.

M a i n Lessons f o r n ew C A S Des ign and Imp lemen ta t ion 

84. 
At the genera l level, the nex t C A S will need to p romo te the emergence o f a na t iona l 
consensus o n reforms , support PRSP pr ior it ies , and he lp ensure cont inu ity o f re levan t policies and 

p rog rams . T h e PRSP process offers an excellent opportunity fo r Bangladesh to build a national 
consensus on p r io r i ty reforms and development programs. But more than identifying the po l icy measures, 
the challenge for the PRSP, and by extension the new CAS, l i e s in ensu r ing that t h e agreed measures are 
consistently implemented across the coming electoral cycle, and that progress o n macroeconomic po l icy 

36 Dur ing the 1999 Bangladesh Development Forum the discussion emphasized development outcomes over level-of-aid inputs 
for the first time in t h i s type o f meeting.

i s fo l lowed closely by sector reforms and legal and administrative changes. Specific lessons f r om the 
recent CAS experience are discussed below and in Table A. 

Strateg ic App roach 

85 . 

As emphasized in the CAS , Bangladesh u rgen t ly needs across-theboard po l i t ica l and 
economic governance changes to achieve faster development results a n d meet the MDGs. CAS 

implementation showed that governance reforms are d i f f icu l t and costly, especially given entrenched 
vested interests and the polarized nature o f Bangladeshi politics. Thus far, however, the CAS approach t o 
governance reforms has been more o f a constraint than a means t o enhance Bank development 

effectiveness. A f t e r the modest results obta ined so far, the Bank faces the challenge o f developing a 
m o r e positive a n d constructive strategic app roach to governance by mov ing f r o m rhe to r ic to 

concrete support . In practical terms, t h i s means unbundling governance issues t o implementable levels, 
gaining more in-depth understanding o f these issues, and going beyond the traditional areas o f past 
support t o governance reform. 

86. 

T h e experience during t h i s C A S p e r i o d shows that re fo rms cannot b e advanced 

comprehensively a n d a t a n even pace. T h e Government’s commitment t o re fo rm contributed pos i t ive ly 
to CAS outcomes, demonstrating that progress can be made even under d i f f icu l t conditions. However, 
after a relatively short-lived window o f opportunity, implementation o f reforms became increasingly 
harder in some sectors w i t h t h e premature s t a r t o f the electoral cycle and the related intensification o f 
confrontational politics. The situation w i l l become even more d i f f icu l t as the 2006 elections draw closer. 

This experience also indicates t h a t increased f lex ib i l i ty in the r e f o rm agenda unde r ly ing the lend ing 

pe r fo rmance tr iggers i s requ i red . CAS triggers should deal practically w i t h a re fo rm pa th that i s no t 
easily predictable. The urgency w i t h wh ich reforms should take place needs to reflect more closely the 
rea l i ty o n the ground, as w e l l as the related government’s understanding o f the feasible speed fo r 
implementing reforms. 

87. 
I n add it ion , the B a n k should b e endeavor ing to w o r k f rom within c r i t ica l sectors r a t h e r 
than disengaging f r o m t h em wh i le wa i t ing f o r re fo rms to occur. CAS implementation showed that 

requiring upfront, o f ten d i f f icu l t reforms before supporting sectoral investments cannot always deliver t h e 
desired outcomes. W h i l e i t i s correct to assume that, in some extreme cases, investment w i thou t reforms 
w i l l no t provide sustainable outcomes, investments along w i t h reforms may often lead to better 
achievement o f sectoral outcomes and overall sector development. T o adop t t h i s approach, the Bank 

should establish a c lear set o f minimum “rules o f engagement” in each sector, instead o f a long l i s t 
o f conditions that cannot b e m e t even if some po l i t ica l w i l l exists. T h e CAS should take in to 

consideration that the macroeconomic situation and po l i t ica l economy o f re fo rm have a s i g n i f i c a n t 
influence in a sector’s performance as w e l l as in the government’s ab i l i ty t o implement changes within 
such sector. As such, i t i s unrealistic t o attempt t o “force” actions beyond the po in t that i s feasible at a 
particular time g iven constraining factors, many o f wh ich are exogenous t o the sector. 

C o u n t r y P r o g r am Issues 

8 8 . 

C A S objectives and outcomes should re f lec t what can b e rea l ist ica l ly achieved within the 

C A S pe r iod . Accordingly, the Bank should s t r ive to keep i t s assistance strategy focused o n the r e s u l t s 
that are feasible g iven country conditions and IDA resource constraints. In t h i s respect, the coun t ry 

p r o g r am support ing C A S outcomes needs to b e especially responsive t o c l ient capabilities and 
ins t i tu t iona l and po l i t ica l context, wh i le re f lec t ing selectivity and max im iz ing partnersh ips with 
development pa r tne rs . 

107 

CAS f lex ib i l i ty should also be reflected in the m ix o f i n s t r um e n t s used to deliver Bank assistance. 

89. 
I n the case o f Bangladesh, a n im p o r t a n t lend ing ins t rumen t could b e p rog ramma t ic , increasingly 
mu lt i-sectora l budge ta ry support t h a t can a l low f o r ad justment the leve l o f assistance to the pace o f 

re fo rms . T h i s approach, however, wou ld demand stepped-up efforts to strengthen fiduciary systems and, 
in general, better results at building institutional capacity beyond the limited number o f “ is lands o f 

excellence.” “Good loca l fit” based o n a tho rough inst itut iona l analysis should thus b e emphasized 
in the nea r fu tu re . 

90. 

T h e above app roach should trans late a t the p ro jec t leve l in to g rea te r rea l ism in p ro jec t 
design, completion schedules, and de f in i t ion o f objectives a n d outcomes, as w e l l as m o r e strategic 

th ink ing about supervision. Increased coordination across sectors i s needed fo r project design and 
supervision since many long-standing factors affecting project preparation and implementation invo lve 
political, legal, and institutional issues that cannot be fully understood no r solved o n a project-by-project 
basis. 

9 1. 
T h e non-lending p r o g r am should be p lanned and imp lemen ted m o r e strateg ica l ly by l i n k i n g 
it be t te r to the lend ing p rog ram , and in genera l to the CAS outcomes. The CAS should consider, at 

the same time, timing and linking analytical wo rk to po l icy formulation processes o f the Government. 
Finally, the Bank should try out other effective ways o f communication besides regular reports and 
dissemination workshops.

J o i n t CAS Process - P rog ress t o d a t e 

1. 
Fou r development partners namely WB, DFID, ADB and Japan initiated a dialogue o n the 
preparation o f a j o i n t Country Assistance Strategy. They gathered in a two day retreat f rom Ma rch 20- 
21st, wh ich took place in the W o r l d Bank offices in Dhaka (program attached). Over 40 staff f rom the 
four organizations participated. T h e ma in objectives o f the retreat were to: 
(i) agree o n t h e m a i n partnership principles and teamwork among the four development partners 
(Box. 1) 
(ii) understand each institution's processes, requirements, and timetables fo r the preparation o f 
their country assistance strategies 
(iii) construct a consistent view o f Bangladesh's achievements and challenges on g row th and 
poverty as identified by t h e analytical wo rk and the resu l ts o f the consultations w i t h the c i v i l 
society and other focus groups 
(iv) agree o n the emerging themes/pillars fo r the strategy 
(v) initiate the preparation o f a j o i n t outcome ma t r ix on t h e basis o f the agreed pillars. 

3. 

2. 
Dr. Kama l Siddique, the Principal Secretary to the PM, addressed the f i r s t dinner o f the retreat 
and spoke about the Government priorities as outlined in their recently prepared National Strategy fo r 
Accelerated Poverty Reduction. Secretary ERD, Mr. Isma i l Zabihullah, was also inv i ted to attend. 
The retreat was successful in achieving i t s objectives and was w e l l received by the participants 
who were actively engaged throughout. The four development par tners agreed o n the pa r tne rsh ip 
gu id ing pr inc ip les (Box 1). There was also broad agreement o n t h e ma in issues and challenges facing 
Bangladesh's efforts t o achieve higher g row th and reduce poverty. 
4. 
Participants agreed o n the m a i n p i l la rs o f the strategy as being: (i) Improvements in t h e 
Inves tmen t C l ima te fo r generating g row th and employment, and: ( i i ) Empowe r ing the Poor through 
be t te r s k i l l s , health, nu t r i t ion and transparent government, w i t h Governance being a key constraint and 
t h e foundation fo r success in bo th pillars . Gender also emerged as an important cross-cutting theme. 
These were consistent with the CAS approach and story-line developed by t h e Bank in February 05 at the 
concept stage. Participants engaged in the preparation o f a j o i n t outcome ma t r ix based on t h e three 
themes, wh ich w i l l guide their wo rk and the discussions w i t h the Government on how the development 
partners w i l l measure progress in the implementation o f the i r programs towards supporting the 
Government's PRSP. W o r k on the outcomes continued throughout the preparation o f t h e CAS. The 
results ma t r ix presented in Attachment 1 to t h i s document i s the result o f such consultations and wo rk 
among the Bank and other development partners. 
A second retreat w i t h the donors took place in July 2005, to focus o n sector specific issues as w e l l 
as instruments t o deliver the strategy. The output o f these processes was the preparation o f a set o f sector 
specific strategy notes covering the m a i n p r io r i ty areas, including, c i v i l service reform, pub l ic financial 
management and procurement, loca l governance, ru ra l infrastructure, transport, Power, Lega l and 
Judicial, Agriculture, and Education. The ma in objective o f the second stage was to agree o n a clearer 
d iv is ion o f responsibilities among donors and especially u s e t h i s p la t fo rm t o invo lve and consult with the 
res t o f the donor community. Therefore, in several o f the sectors mentioned above consultations were 
he ld w i t h the L C G sub-groups interested in the sector. As a fo l low up to these meetings development 
partners w i l l continue to cooperate and coordinate closely with the Government to ensure full support of 
the PRSP. 
6 . 
A newsletter o n the j o i n t CAS was prepared o n behalf o f the four development partners.

RemarkdExp lanat ion 

The Bank may finance up to 100 percent o f the costs o f 
ind iv idua l operations. Counterpart funding w i l l be 
encouraged. Cost sharing arrangements w i l l be determined 
o n a case-by-case basis, taking in to account t h e 
Government’s development program and budget allocated 
f o r t h e concerned sector(s), link to PRSP/CAS priorities, 
the pro jec t context and impact o f the cost sharing 
arrangement on pro jec t implementation and achievement o f 
project outcomes, imp l ica t ions f o r the CAS envelope, and 
other po ten t ia l sources o f co-financing. I t i s expected that 
the Bank’s f m n c i n g share cou ld be higher, inter a l ia , in 
community-based projects; prov is ion o f services at t h e 
loca l level, inc lud ing loca l infrastructure; and social and 
human development investments. T h e Bank’s financing 
share may be lower in general infrastructure investments. 

The Bank w i l l continue to mon i to r the medium-term f isca l 
pos i t ion and prospects and i ts imp l ica t ions f o r recurrent 
cost financing. In determining Bank financing o f recurrent 
costs in individual projects, the Bank w i l l care fu l ly 
consider sustainability issues at t h e sector and pro jec t 
levels, inc lud ing arrangements c r i t ica l to operation and 
maintenance (O&M) and im p l i e d future budgetary outlays. 
Simultaneously, the Bank w i l l continue to promote the 
consolidation o f development and revenue budgets and 
improvements in O&M allocation. 

Local Costfinancing. A r e the 

requirements fo r Bank f inanc ing 
o f l o c a l expenditures met, 
namely that: (i) financing 
requirements f o r the country’s 
development program w o u l d 
exceed the pub l ic sector’s own 
resources (e.g., from taxa t ion 
and other revenues) and 
expected domestic borrowing; 
and (ii) the financing o f fore ign 
cxpenditures alone w o u l d no t 
enable the Bank to assist in the 
h a n c i n g o f individual projects. 

Taxes and duties. A r e there any 

taxes and duties that the bank 
would n o t finance? 

Yes 

The two requirements are met. The Bank may finance 
local costs in the proportions needed in ind iv idua l projects. 

Vone 

Faxes and duties are considered reasonable and non- 
i iscr im ina tory . Subject to ongoing mon i to r ing o f t h e 
:ountry’s tax po l icy , t h e Bank m a y finance taxes and duties 
issociated with pro jec t expenditures. At the pro jec t- 
i p e c f i c level, the Bank w i l l consider whether taxes and 
lu t ies constitute an excessively high share o f pro jec t costs.

Summary Background Note 

A. 

Cost Sharing 

1. 

Presently, IDA accounts on average fo r about 80 percent o f total financing o f t h e projects in 
wh ich i t i s involved. Greater flexibility in project cost financing wou ld a l low the Bank and GOB t o 
determine the cost-sharing ratios that best support project implementation and achievement o f project 

outcomes. Accordingly, B an k financing fo r ind iv idua l projects in Bangladesh may be up to 100 

percent o f project costs. T o exercise the added f lex ib i l i ty in cost sharing, the fo l low ing factors w i l l b e 
taken in to consideration: 

e 

e 

A t the general level, IDA’S overall resource envelope fo r Bangladesh and availability o f other 
sources o f financing. I f other sources o f financing are no t readily available fo r co-financing, the 
Bank may finance 100 percent o f a l l program / project costs, depending o f course, o n sector 
and project leve l considerations. 

A t the sector and p rog ram / p r o j e c t level, information o n the borrower’s use o f ow n resources 
t o fund i t s development program fo r the sector(s) concerned. Funding f rom government or from 
other sources w i l l be encouraged t o leverage IDA resources and promote partnerships. 

2. 

Accordingly, the Bank w i l l apply the fo l low ing approach to cost sharing i n Bangladesh: On a 
yearly basis, i t w i l l discuss w i t h the Government the upcoming projects in the p ipe l ine and agree o n 
tentative financing share o f p ro j ect costs, wh ich wou ld subsequently be reflected in the Project Concept 
No te (PCN) o f t h e specific project fo r further consideration. As noted above, any decision on cost 
sharing w i l l consider the overall IDA allocation fo r Bangladesh, and the understanding that 100 percent 
financing o f a given project may have an impact o n the s ize o f fu tu re IDA credits, a n d o r o n the number 
o f projects to be financed by the Bank. Importantly, at the specific project level, financing ( f rom other 
than IDA) may come f rom GOB, beneficiaries, third party international donors and financiers, or when 
feasible, f rom loca l governments. These contributions do no t need to be provided o n a matching 
payment-by-payment basis. T h e Bank w i l l be able to finance t h e full amount o f specific expenditures, 
rather than a pro-rata share o f all (or nearly all) project expenditures. These measures w i l l help 
streamline project budget releases and payment procedures and enable to focus better o n actual project 
implementation and achievement o f p ro j ect outcomes. 

3. 

The f ina l decision on cost sharing arrangements w i l l be done on a case-by-case basis, after 

careful analysis o f the Government’s development program and budget allocated fo r the concerned 
sector or sectors, link to PRSP priorities, and impact o f the cost sharing arrangement o n project 
implementation and achievement o f project outcomes. However, considering the above approach and 
criteria, i t i s expected that the Bank’s financing share could be higher, inter a l ia , in community-based 
projects; provision o f services at the loca l leve l , inc lud ing loca l infrastructure; and social and human 
development investments. The Bank’s financing share may be lower in general infrastructure 
investments, particularly in cases when sustainability issues are critical (see section o n recurring costs). 

4. 

Current operations may be reviewed and retrofitted to the proposed CFPs o n a case-by-case 
basis. Nevertheless, t h i s exercise, and especially changes in cost sharing arrangements, w i l l on ly be 
considered fo r projects that mee t the fo l low ing criteria: (i) t h e ongoing project i s in the early stages o f 
implementation, and the effort to apply the proposed CFPs retroactively w i l l have a demonstrable 
impact o n project implementation and achievement o f project outcomes; (ii) t h e project ratings are 

131 

satisfactory; and (iii) country ownership i s considered to be strong, as demonstrated through 
commitment and dedication to project monitoring and implementation. 

B. 

R e c u r r e n t Costs 

5 . 

O f ten starting f r om 100 percent, the Bank has been financing recurrent costs on a declining 
scale in most projects in Bangladesh, and particularly in sectors such as education, health and 
agriculture. In fact, in some projects, 100 percent o f recurrent costs, wh ich usually include incremental 
operational costs and project management, have been financed fo r several years. O n the other hand, the 
Bank has no t financed t h i s t y p e o f expenditures under infrastructure projects, w i t h the exception o f 
ru ra l roads projects where financial support has been extended to up t o 60 percent o f eligible 
rehabilitation and maintenance expenditures. 

6. 

Bangladesh’s overall fiscal and debt situation and prospects are considered reasonable, and 
financing recurrent costs o n a steady basis w i l l no t likely affect t h i s situation. Moreover, according to 
OED reports, most Bank-financed projects in Bangladesh have had between modest to reasonable 
sustainability prospects, although the country’s performance in t h i s respect has recently been below the 
regional and Bankwide averages’. Some o f the main factors affecting sustainability have been lack o f 
medium te rm perspective in budget formulation and the fragmentation o f recurrent and capital budget 
planning processes. These issues, however, are being addressed through the ongoing effort t o 
strengthen budget preparation and implementation, and to develop the MTBF. 

7 . 

Sustainability has also been affected by the fact that pub l ic expenditures o n operations and 
maintenance (O&M) have tended to be inadequate. Partly because donor assistance i s concentrated on 
the ADP, the government has leaned towards new investments w i thou t fully understanding the 
implications fo r recurrent expenditures.* T h e ongoing support t o improve pub l ic expenditure 
management i s thus focusing o n iden t i fymg mechanisms to secure adequate resource allocation o f non- 
wage O & M expenditures in c r i t ica l sectors such as education, health, and infrastructure. In addition to 
inadequate funding, t h i s e f fo r t i s look ing at options fo r addressing chronic problems w i t h O&M, such 
as overextension o f infkastructure and service networks in re la t ion t o financial and institutional 
capacity, weak bureaucratic incentives t o budget and spend o n t h i s c r i t ica l item, inappropriate mix 
between the wage b i l l and non-wage O&M, and weak cost recovery. 

8. 

Within the framework o f the current efforts t o improve pub l ic expenditure management, n o 

specific limit i s proposed f o r the f inanc ing o f recu r ren t costs in ind iv idua l operations. 

Accordingly, the leve l o f recurrent cost financing w i l l be decided by carefully considering sustainability 
issues at the sector and project levels, inc lud ing imp l ied future budgetary outlays and progress made in 
addressing O & M issues. When deciding, the Bank w i l l also seek to exploit opportunities to encourage 
early transfer o f recurrent costs t o the Revenue Budget. The t y p e o f recurrent costs to be financed 
wou ld cover areas such as operational costs and project management, in addition to other areas 
consistent w i t h sustainability o f investments, and in the long te rm , o f project outcomes. In addition to 
close attention to progress made o n budget consolidation and O&M resource allocation, the Bank w i l l 
continue to mon i to r the aggregate fiscal pos i t ion and prospects and i ts implications fo r recurrent cost 
financing. 

In the case o f Bangladesh, sus ta inab i l i ty o f p r o j e c t bene f i ts was cons idered l i k e l y f o r 63 percen t o f the 18 
pro jec ts evaluated by OED be tween FYOO and FY04. T h e reg ion ’s and Bank’s shares we re 8 1 percen t and 7 3 
percent, respec t ive ly . 

Operations and maintenance (O&M) expenditures represented a comparatively l ow 0.5 percent o f GDP in FY04.

Local Cost Financing 

9. 

The Bank may finance loca l expenditure fo r projects when i t i s satisfied that: (a) financing 
requirements fo r the development program o f the country where t h e project i s located wou ld exceed the 
pub l ic sector’s own resources and expected domestic borrowing; and (b) the financing o f foreign 
expenditures alone wou ld no t enable the Bank to assist in the financing o f such projects. 

10. 

In Bangladesh, the Bank h a s been financing shares o f total loca l project cost ranging f r om 50 
percent in the ru ra l roads sub-sector t o 80 percent in the social sectors. Overall, loca l expenses comprise 
a significant proportion o f project expenses in the country, and Bank financial support fo r these loca l 
costs i s c r i t ica l to the v iab i l i ty o f many projects. Specifically, about 69 percent o f to ta l disbursements 
between FY 9 9 and FY04, and 8 1 percent between F Y 0 2 and FY04, were fo r loca l expenditures. T h i s 
trend i s expected to continue in fu tu re for projects in t h e po r t fo l io and p ipe l ine . Moreover, the financing 
requirements fo r Bangladesh’s development program substantially exceed t h e pub l ic sector’s own 
resources, and l i k e l y more so when implementation o f the PRSP reaches full steam. Presently, 
Bangladesh faces a financing gap w i t h respect t o development programs o f about 2.5 percent o f GDP, 
within the constraints o f t h e macro-framework agreed with the Fund and the Bank. Despite renewed 
efforts, Government revenues f rom tax and non-tax sources remain comparatively low, wh ich further 
l i m i t s the pub l ic sector’s capacity to meet development needs.3 

11. 

The two criteria fo r Bank financing o f loca l costs are met, and i t i s proposed that foreign and 
loca l expenditures be treated in t h e same way w i t h regard to Bank financing. Therefore, the Bank m a y 

f inance loca l (and foreign) costs in any p ropo r t ion needed in individual projects. T h i s approach 

should provide greater f lex ib i l i ty and reduce administrative burden in IDA-financed projects. 

D. 

Financing Taxes and Duties 

12. 

Bangladesh has a w e l l defined tax po l icy and parameters w i t h a broad-based VAT, 
supplemented by luxury taxes and an income tax. The Na t iona l Board o f Revenue (NBR) i s the apex 
tax authority in the country, collecting over 90 percent o f total taxes. The NBR po r t ion o f total taxes 
includes customs duty, Value Added Tax (VAT), supplementary duty (SD), income tax, foreign travel 
tax, electricity duty, wealth tax, advertisement tax, gift tax and miscellaneous insignificant taxes. The 
‘non-NBR portion’ o f taxes includes narcotics duty, land revenue, non-judicial stamp, registration fee 
and mo to r vehicle tax. D i rec t taxes represent a l ow share o f total taxes, wh ich makes the tax structure 
heav i ly dependent o n indirect taxes. T h e major taxes are customs duty, VAT, SD and income tax. 

13. 

Overall rates o f the taxes w i t h implications fo r Bank financing are relatively m ~ d e r a t e . ~ VAT i s 
15 percent. Income tax rates range f rom 10 to 25 p e r ~ e n t . ~ The corporate tax rate ranges between 35 and 
40 percent, depending o n whether the company has publicly-traded shares or not. Incomes f r om small 
and cottage indus tr ies are given a 5 to 10 percent tax rebate depending o n the production volume. Tax 
holidays fo r a period o f 5 to 7 years, depending o n t h e location, are given t o new ly established business 
enterprises. Some strategic investment goods are exempt f r om VAT and impo r t duties. 

At about 9 percent, the Revenue to GDP ra t io remains qu i te l o w by in terna t iona l standards. 
Up-to-date and detailed in forma t ion on taxes and duties in Bangladesh can be found at ~ ~ ~ l
website o f the Na t iona l Boa rd o f Revenue). 
The specific slabs o f income tax rate are: O n the f i r s t Tk. 120,000 o f to ta l income, 0 percent; on the nex t Tk. 250,000, 10 
percent; on the nex t 300,000, 15 percent; on the nex t Tk. 350,000,20 percent, and o n the balance o f to ta l income, 25 percent.

Trade liberalization has been advanced w i t h a reduction in and rationalization o f customs 
duties. Accordingly, the average rate o f customs duty was lowered f r om 21 percent in FYOl to 15.4 
percent in the FY 0 6 budget, wh i le the top rate was lowered f r om 37.5 percent to 25 percent. The 
number o f non-zero custom tariff rates was reduced f rom four t o three. Custom duties range f r om 7.5 to 
30 percent, and the average custom duty rate i s about 14 percent. Supplementary Du t ies (SDs) are 
ma in ly levied o n only-imported products (e.g., imports o f textiles), w i t h rates ranging from 15 to 35 
percent. A few f i s h products have SD rates o f 40 percent, and rates o f certain products that are 
considered as hav ing potential harmful effects o n t h e environment or health have been kept relatively 
high.6 In general, however, the SD rate on imports averages 30 percent. In contrast, duties and other 
charges o n mo to r vehicles imports can, in certain cases, reach high  level^.^ Nonetheless, t h i s i s no t 
expected to have a substantial impact o n Bank financing, since Bank-supported projects do not 
no rma l ly include procurement o f a considerable number o f vehicles. Importantly, close attention w i l l be 
pa id to t h i s issue when deciding cost sharing percentages. 

15. 

Overall, there i s n o differential tax treatment in the tax structure that cou ld impact Bank- 
financed projects. Currently, the tax and duty incidence on goods and works fnanced by the Bank in 
Bangladesh i s about 20 percent. The Bank has been financing 100 percent o f foreign expenditures on 
equipment goods and materials, as w e l l as 100 percent o f loca l expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 70-80 
percent o f other items procured locally. 

16. 

In brief, the re are no taxes o r duties t h a t have been iden t i f ied as unreasonable or discriminatory. 

Under these circumstances, the Bank m a y f inance taxes and duties associated with p ro jec t 

expenditures. The application o f t h i s general approach w i l l be subject t o ongoing mon i to r ing o f 
Bangladesh’s tax po l icy and i t s implementation in Bank projects. At the project-level, the Bank wou ld 
consider whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share o f projects costs. 

Products with h igh SDs include, inter alia, cigars and cigarettes (90 percent); cocoa and chocolate (60 percent); beer (250 
percent); and hard liquor and food containing alcohol exceeding 0.5 percent b y volume (350 percent). These SDs, however, 
have no incidence on Bank-financed projects. 
OveraIl tax and duties w i l l vary depending on the type o f motor vehicle and i t s cylinder capacity.
