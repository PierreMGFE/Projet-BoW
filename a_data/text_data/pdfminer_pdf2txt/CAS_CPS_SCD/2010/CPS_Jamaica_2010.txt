EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
Despite the advantages of political stability, location, language, time zone and natural 
resource endowments, Jamaica’s development gains remain low. Notably, during 1973-2007, 
Jamaica recorded annual output growth of 0.8 percent, and a decline in average labor 
productivity by 1.5 percent per annum.  In comparison, output increased by 4.2 percent in 
comparable middle-income countries with concurrent productivity growth. 

2. 
Nevertheless, Jamaica has recorded a number of positive achievements. First, the 
country consolidated economic liberalization efforts and gradually recovered from a major 
financial crisis in 1995-97. The country now has a relatively stable and well-capitalized financial 
sector, albeit not free of systemic risk. Second, Jamaica significantly reduced the incidence of 
poverty, in part because of poverty reduction interventions and growth in remittances. The 
national poverty rate fell from 28.4 percent in 1989 to 9.9 percent in 2007. Third, the country 
was among the pioneers in initiating surveys for evidence-based policy decisions.  

3. 
Jamaica is vulnerable to climate change and this is compounded by the global 
economic crisis and longstanding structural issues. Jamaica is one of the countries that show 
the highest exposure to risk in not only the Caribbean but also globally. This exposure to risk 
underscores the need to support Jamaica in integrating climate change adaptation measures into 
core development programs across sectors, and targeting specific hazards, particularly hazardous 
or vulnerable places and people within the coastal zones, and the urban and rural poor. 

4. 
The current global crisis has seriously affected Jamaica, and its impacts are likely to 
persist over the medium term. Output is projected to decline for the second year, by another 
3.5 percent in FY09/10, largely due to the collapse of the bauxite industry and reductions in 
remittances and tourism receipts. As a result, government revenue collections fell and the fiscal 
deficit is projected to be twice the budgeted level for FY09/10. Significant support is needed 
from the multilateral institutions to avert serious economic consequences. 

5. 
Longstanding structural issues include: (i) high debt ratio that hinders government 
ability to provide quality services and foster development; (ii) low level of trust in society; (iii) 
low level of formal training among the labor force; (iv) excessive cost of electricity that affects 
the economy’s competitiveness and the welfare of the population; (v) significantly higher 
unemployment rates among the youth and females; (vi) high incidence of crime and violence; 
and (vii) vulnerability of infrastructure and housing stocks to windstorms and earthquakes. 

6. 
An important gender issue in Jamaica is that boys tend to underperform girls in 
school and engage in risky behaviors from early on. These behaviors are linked to crime and 
violence and other structural gender issues such as teenage pregnancy and gender based violence. 
Jamaica has registered significant progress in women’s economic and political empowerment as 
well as reproductive health. Although there is still a long way to go in terms of empowering 
women, it is hard to make progress without directly addressing the issue of boys at risk.  

7. 
Jamaica is working towards addressing short-term crisis and long-term development 
challenges with support from a 27-month IMF program and budgetary support from the World 
Bank and other development partners. The longer-term strategy is based on a Vision 2030 

i 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
National Development Plan document with six national outcomes and five supporting national 
outcomes.  

8. 
The Jamaica-World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (FY10-13) focuses 
on three development pillars (see Annex 2).  The three pillars are anchored to: (i) the country’s 
own medium-term framework (MTF); (ii) opportunities for deeper partnerships with other 
international development partners to pull resources for a meaningful impact on selected national 
outcomes; (iii) the recommendations of the CAS Completion Report; and (iv) the lessons from 
the ongoing projects; .  Overall, Bank support is expected to include two or three DPLs, six 
investment loans and seven analytical activities, reflecting a deeper engagement sought by the 
government elected in September 2007. The Bank will seek to extend collaboration with other 
development partners to multiply and complement the impacts of its own funded activities. The 
IFC will focus on investment climate, financial market development, and access to finance, 
infrastructure, tourism and emerging sectors in health, education and information technology.  

9. 
The first pillar is to support economic stability through fiscal and debt sustainability that 
entail two policy-based loans in the current CPS period.  The budgetary support will be 
complemented with analytical and advisory services, including Trust Fund grants, and, 
potentially, an associated TA loan to support reform implementation in an expeditious manner.  

10. 
The second pillar is to promote inclusive growth through three result areas: (i) 
strengthening human capital. This is an area for Bank and IFC synergies which includes Public-
Private Partnerships in the context of projects to support a bipartisan education strategy for 
education transformation and skills for inclusive growth. These projects will be complemented 
with a poverty assessment, and regional studies on labor markets (nurse migration) and non-
communicable diseases; (ii) crime and violence prevention with a project informed by lessons of 
the ongoing inner cities project and the accompanying JSDF Grant on crime and violence.  A 
country social assessment will also be undertaken; (iii) promotion of rural development with a 
recently approved rural economic development initiative, technical assistance with agricultural 
risk management and a disaster risk reduction JSDF grant.  IFC will emphasize private sector 
investments improving economic conditions for Base of the Pyramid segments of the population. 

11. 
The third pillar is to promote sustained growth through: (i) strengthening non-labor 
competitiveness with IFC and Bank collaboration on an energy program, investment climate, 
regional communications, transport and logistics. An infrastructure study will help to better 
understand the linkages between public capital and private investments for development; and (ii) 
climate resilience and vulnerability reduction through a JSDF landslide risk reduction grant, a 
Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (with IDB) and a country environment assessment.   

12. 
The cross-cutting theme of governance will seek to achieve more efficient financial 
management and allocation of budget expenditures to achieve results. 

13. 
There are substantial risks from (i) current economic crisis; (ii) natural disasters; (iii) 
political environment of a two seats Parliamentary majority; (iv) country fiduciary systems; (v) 
governance and crime; and (vi) institutional weaknesses for reforms. The risks are mitigated by 
the government or concerted effort by international development partners, including the Bank. In 
addition, following the extraordinary level of budgetary support to Jamaica proposed in this CPS, 
there is a risk that the Bank would not be in a position to provide support in the future if Jamaica 
ii 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were to face acute and large financing needs either because of lack of sufficient follow through 
in implementing critical reforms or because of external shocks. 

14. 

In its discussion, the Board may wish to consider the following: 

(i) Given the Bank’s available financing in Jamaica, does the proposed strategy represent 
the most appropriate role the Bank can perform to support the government’s strategy? 
(ii) Does the Country Partnership Strategy adequately identify the risks to the successful 
implementation of the Bank program?

JAMAICA-WORLD BANK GROUP 
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY, FY10-13 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
Jamaica, the largest English-speaking Caribbean country, enjoys natural 
beauty that attracts more tourists every year than its population of 2.7 million and is 
in close proximity to large trading partners.  It has the seventh largest natural harbor in 
the world and is only one hour and twenty minutes by air from Miami. 
2. 
Despite advantages of location, language, time zone and natural resource 
endowments, Jamaica’s development progress has been low.  During 1973-2007, 
annual average growth was 0.8 percent while labor productivity declined by 1.5 percent.  
The country consolidated economic liberalization efforts and gradually recovered from a 
major financial crisis in 1995-97. However, public investment has been constrained by 
the need to service a large debt stock, and public trust has eroded in public institutions 
because of the high levels of youth unemployment, violent crime, and corruption.   
3. 
Achieving a higher path of development, reduced economic volatility, and 
greater social stability is urgent and has become more complex.  The 2009 financial 
crisis has negatively impacted tourism receipts, remittances and the bauxite industry.  
Together with a high debt overhang, the country is severely constrained as it seeks to 
undertake needed policies to overcome the crisis and protect past social gains. 
4. 
In addition, Jamaica remains vulnerable to natural disasters.  The country 
lies at the edge of the hurricane track and experiences direct hits and indirect storm 
damages.  Damages from the three major recent storms, for example, exceeded US$1 
billion, resulting in a heavy fiscal burden, increased indebtedness, and redirection of 
resources from medium-term development plans. The country also lies in an earthquake 
zone. 
5. 
Jamaica, like other Caribbean nations, is highly vulnerable to global climate 
change. While the severities of the impacts vary from sector to sector, there is a suite of 
priority concerns directly linked to climate change that is virtually ubiquitous across the 
country. The key impacts that are already manifesting in Jamaica with negative 
consequences for critical sectors of the economy include: increased droughts and floods; 
sea level rise leading to accelerated coastal erosion; increased flood risk and loss of land; 
saline intrusion into coastal aquifers; increased destructiveness of tropical storms; loss of 
protective coastal systems, such as coral reefs partly due to higher ocean surface 
temperatures; and loss of livelihoods, especially those dependent on tourism and 
fisheries. 
6. 
Also, like other English-speaking Caribbean countries, an important gender 
issue in Jamaica is that boys tend to underperform girls in school and engage in 
risky behaviors from early on. These behaviors are linked to crime and violence, and 
other structural gender issues such as teenage pregnancy and gender based violence. 
Jamaica has registered significant progress in women’s economic and political 
empowerment as well as reproductive health. Although there is still a long way to go in 

1 

 
 
 
terms of empowering women, it is hard to make progress without directly addressing the 
issue of boys at risk and masculinity.  
7. 
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY10-13 aims to contribute to 
government efforts to set the country on a path of greater economic and social 
stability, and inclusive and sustained growth within a stronger governance 
framework. The CPS, a joint strategy of the Bank Group, is aligned with the 
government’s outcome-oriented, medium-term framework (MTF), which remains 
broadly valid in the current global crisis (See Table 2, Annexes 2 and 6).   

II. 

COUNTRY CONTEXT, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK 

A. 
Political Context 
8. 
Jamaica is a Westminster-style parliamentary democracy.  Politics have 
historically been dominated by two main parties – the People’s National Party (PNP) and 
the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). Democratic participation and elections have increasingly 
been more free and fair.  Jamaicans have long enjoyed a high degree of personal freedom, 
freedom of expression, and a vibrant free press.   
9. 
The general elections held in September 2007 resulted in a change in the 
ruling party after 18 years. The governing JLP has 32 seats compared with the 
opposition’s 28.  The general election victory was predicated, inter alia, on a platform of: 
reduction in crime and violence, economic growth, poverty reduction, and strengthening 
of the governance framework, particularly in relation to combating corruption. These 
goals remain evasive but are high priorities for the government.  

B. 

Governance and Corruption 

10. 
The Transparency International Corruption Perception Index declined 
steadily in the last decade, signifying worsening perceptions of corruption.  In 2008, 
Jamaica was ranked 96 out of 180 countries, with only the Dominican Republic, Guyana 
and Haiti ranking lower among Caribbean countries.  In July 2008, public opinion polls, 
for the first time, listed corruption (21%) as the second most serious problem facing the 
country behind crime and violence (57%). Improvements in the public financial 
management and procurement systems are needed to drastically reduce the scope for 
corruption. The procurement policy has improved but scope remains for further 
improvement (see Section III below).  
11. 
The government is committed to tackling corruption.  The National Integrity 
Action Forum was launched by the Prime Minister in 2008 and meets quarterly. The 
government has been able to attract a number of energetic new reformers in key positions 
and retain champions of national integrity in key agencies.  

C. 

Crime and Violence 

12. 
Jamaica’s homicide rate is among the highest in the world, with adverse 
consequences for investment and development.  Preliminary data for 2009 estimate 
that 6.2 persons out of every 10,000 were murdered.  Guns were used in 77 percent of the 
homicides. These crimes, many of them linked to armed gangs, are often characterized by 

2 

 
 
male on male, poor on poor, and youth on youth in the impoverished communities. The 
cost of interpersonal violence in 2006 was estimated to be about 5 percent of GDP1. A 
World Bank study (2007) estimated that if the homicide rate was reduced to the level of 
Costa Rica – that is, a quarter of its then level – the country would see a 5.4 percentage 
point increase in the annual per capita GDP growth rate2.   
13. High levels of crime are associated with a pattern of politically motivated 
violence in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of Jamaica as a significant point 
for the trans-shipment of drugs from South America to the US and Europe in the 
1990s.  This development coincided with further erosion of social capital from high 
unemployment and the consequent emigration of many professional and qualified 
Jamaicans. A complex relationship evolved between organized crime and inner-city 
communities, as major criminal gangs – generally involved in illegal narcotics and 
extortion – control many neighborhoods and often provide key services to residents. The 
major gangs have weakened in recent years, at least partly due to international initiatives 
to curb drug trans-shipment.  However, smaller local groups have since been vying to fill 
the void and the conflict between them has kept rates of homicides at high levels.  

D. 

Poverty and Human Development 

14. 
Poverty remains relatively high in rural areas.  The poverty incidence fell from 
28.4 percent in 1990 to 9.9 percent in 2007. Poverty declined sharply in the Kingston 
metropolitan area, from 13.3 percent to 6.2 percent over the same period. By contrast, 
poverty in rural areas declined from 37.5 percent to 15.3 percent.  Poverty reduction is 
attributable, in part, to: (i) a rise in remittances from increased emigration following the 
financial meltdown in 1995-97; (ii) a decline in the relative prices of food in the 1996-
2004 period, which benefited poor households disproportionately; and, (iii) a sharp 
reduction in inflation, which also benefitted the poor.  Although the effects of the sharp 
increases in energy and food prices in mid-20083 and the recent economic crises have not 
been fully measured, it is likely that the poor have been adversely impacted.  Against this 
background, the government in 2008 increased the amount and widened the coverage of 
the conditional cash transfer for the poor and the most vulnerable. While addressing the 
fiscal and debt sustainability issues, the government plans to expand the conditional cash 
transfer program to ease any adverse impact on the poor. 
15. 
Poverty reduction, however, does not square with other facts. For example, 
surveys show that the share of the consumption of the lowest quintile since 1990 remains 
at 6-7 percent and that for the wealthiest quintile at 45-46 percent. Data for 2008 show 
that 20 percent of the population lived in informal settlements with 60 percent in urban 
areas. An estimated 37 percent of the population are squatters and, therefore, without land

Jamaica”  in Manual for Estimating the Economic Costs of Injuries Due to Interpersonal and Self-Directed 
Violence. Geneva: World Health Organization and personal correspondence with Dr. Ward. 
2  During 1996-2000, Costa Rica’s homicide rate averaged 8.1 per 100,000 compared with 33.8 for 
Jamaica.  
3 The end of trade preferences could also have negatively affected poverty rates in rural areas, especially in 
parishes where significant proportions of households were engaged in the sugar and/or banana industry.

titles and access to capital.  The government is rolling out land titling in parts of the 
country but needs to expand it to ease accessing financing and getting jobs.   
16. 
 Human capital development is of concern as about 35 percent of potential 
workers remain outside the labor force and two-thirds of those have never passed a 
Grade 9 level test, which is a requirement to attain vocational certification.  The 
prevalence of the increasingly prominent informal labor market4 and the fact that one out 
of two households receives remittances for sustenance, could mean that the reservation 
wage is high. A better understanding of the causes is needed to devise appropriate policy 
tools to adequately address the human development issues. 
17. 
In terms of social indicators, Jamaica will achieve most of its Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs).  Life expectancy is comparable to high income countries 
(72 years in 2007), enrollment in primary and junior secondary school is near universal, 
and access to water and sanitation services has improved considerably with coverage at 
93 percent and 80 percent, respectively.  Based on national estimates, it is expected that 
Jamaica will comfortably meet targets for poverty reduction, infant and child nutrition, 
primary education and access to safe drinking water.  The country is on track to halt and 
reverse the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis and possibly HIV/AIDS; however, it 
will not meet targets for infant and maternal mortality5.  With respect to education, the 
problem is not access but education quality and boys’ under-performance and attendance, 
which are in part connected to poverty. 

E. 

Gender Dimensions and Unemployment 

18. 
Females out-perform boys in education, 
but this is not reflected in most spheres of life.  
Female students account for 70 percent of 
students at the tertiary level of education and they 
begin to out-perform boys at an early age.  
However, the labor market is characterized by 
disproportionately high unemployment among 
youth and females.  The unemployment rate for 
young females, for example, is more than twice 
that of young males (see Table 1). This makes 
female youth vulnerable to sexual exploitation 
and 
adolescent 
pregnancy. Male 
youth 
unemployment is also high and puts them in a 
vulnerable position vis-à-vis criminal gangs.

4 The informal sector increased from 28 percent in 1989 to 43 percent in 2001 according to IDB (2006): 
The Informal Sector in Jamaica.  Informality is likely to have increased in the current economic crisis.

19. 
There is a worrisome trend among boys who are out of school in Jamaica. 
The flip side of high female participation and 
superior performance in education is that boys’ 
are opting out. Boys become more susceptible 
to choosing alternative lives, including crime 
and violence. This condition has implications 
for personal 
and 
societal development, 
including the levels of functional socialization, 
of trust, and crime and violence in the country.  

F. 

Debt Stock and Dynamics 

Box 1: Recent Tax Measures 
Progress on expanding 
the 
tax base 
continues despite the impact of the ongoing 
global crisis. Major personal income tax and 
corporate 
income 
tax simplifications were 
postponed due to the impact of the global crisis 
on Jamaica. Nevertheless, the government has 
taken measures to broaden the tax base and 
improve efficiency. This included reducing tax 
exemptions and 
the 
introduction of four 
packages of tax measures over the past year.  
The first two tax measures were introduced as 
part of the FY09/10 budget. The government 
raised the excise tax on gasoline by J$8.75 per 
liter, and broadened the General Consumption 
Tax (GCT) base by eliminating exemptions on 
several 
items. The 
third package was 
introduced on October 1, 2009 and included 
increasing the GCT rate on telephone services 
from 20 percent to 25 percent and increasing 
the departure tax from J$1,000 to J$1,800.  
The fourth package, introduced on January 1, 
2010, included the following measures: (i) The 
GCT rate was raised from 16½ percent to 17½ 
percent. In addition, GCT of 10 percent was 
levied on residential electricity consumption 
above 200 kwh and commercial/industrial 
electricity consumption; 
the rate of GCT 
applicable to the tourism sector has been 
increased from 8.25 percent to 10 percent; and 
commercial importers are now required to pay 
a 5 percent advanced GCT payment on all 
taxable imported goods; (ii) tax rates for 
income over J$5 million but below J$10 
million and for income over J$10 million have 
been adjusted from 25 percent to 27.5 percent 
and 35 percent, respectively, until March 31, 
2011; and, (iii) an ad valorem fuel tax of 15 
percent was applied. These measures are 
expected to generate revenue equivalent to 2 
percent of GDP on a full-year basis. 

20. 
Jamaica has the third highest public 
debt-to-GDP ratio 
in the world. Total 
domestic and external public debt increased 
from 84 percent of GDP in 1997 to a peak of 
134.1 percent of GDP in FY99/00, following 
the financial crisis of the mid-1990s. Public 
debt-to-GDP decreased to 113.5 percent in 
FY07/08, before rising again to 124.0 percent 
in FY08/09. Reflecting the worsening global 
economic crisis and declining domestic 
economic activity, the debt ratio is estimated to 
have reached 139.7 percent of GDP or 
US$6,212 per Jamaican (see Annex B6).  
21. 
The government has embarked on an 
ambitious reform program to reduce debt 
and achieve fiscal sustainability. The reform 
program is centered on containing and reducing 
debt, enhancing government revenues, and 
increasing 
the efficiency of public sector 
spending and investment.  In support of this 
program, 
the 
government 
has 
sought 
unprecedented level of resources, exceeding 20 
percent of GDP, 
from 
its 
international 
development partners (IDPs) in order to restore 
macroeconomic stability, provide liquidity back-stopping, and ensure resources are 
available to support the longer run fiscal and institutional reform program. 
22. 
Towards reducing the fiscal gap and the debt ratio, the authorities 
introduced new tax measures (see Box 1), and announced a debt exchange offer on 
January 14, 2010 with the objective of reducing the interest rate on, and extending 
the maturity profile of a portion of outstanding domestic debt. The government 
estimates that fiscal savings from the debt exchange will be 3 percent of GDP during 
FY10/11. The offer does not envisage any cut in principal. Impacts on the domestic 
financial sector are estimated to be small.  Following the announcement of the debt 
exchange, Jamaica’s credit ratings were downgraded by rating agencies. However, the 

5 

 
 
same rating agencies also highlighted that upon successful completion of the debt 
exchange, Jamaica’s ratings would be upgraded as the debt exchange would reduce the 
debt service burden and improve the prospects for sustainability. Nonetheless, the 
downgrading presents short-term challenges and the debt exchange itself may reduce the 
liquidity in domestic markets — making it harder for the government to secure financing 
in the short term.  
23. 
Among structural measures, 
the 
government 
is 
formulating 
a Fiscal 
Responsibility Framework to control debt 
accumulated by public bodies — their debt 
is about 19 percent of GDP (see Box 2). 
Despite high primary surpluses of the central 
government in past years, debt levels hardly 
fell, partially because of contingent liabilities 
of some public bodies6. Notwithstanding the 
risk of having to service the public bodies’ 
non-guaranteed debt, owed mostly to the 
domestic private sector, 
the government’s 
current debt management strategy focuses on 
direct and central government guaranteed debt 
only. With the expected consolidation of 
public bodies into the central budget under a 
reform program, 
the non-guaranteed debt 
portfolio will be 
integrated 
into 
the 
government’s Debt Management Unit’s 
mandate.   

Box 2: Government Reform Program 
The government has embarked on an 
ambitious reform program for reducing debt 
and achieving fiscal sustainability. At the 
core of 
this 
reform 
is 
the new Fiscal 
Responsibility Framework (FRF) which will be 
implemented over the course of the next two 
years. It specifies responsibilities, processes, 
and targets for achieving the government’s 
objective of improved fiscal sustainability, 
including the specific target of bringing public 
debt to below 100 percent of GDP by 2015/16. 
This reform program is supported by the Bank 
through a proposed programmatic series of 
DPLs. 
Fiscal sustainability requires containing and 
reducing debt, 
enhancing 
government 
revenues, and increasing the efficiency of 
public sector spending and investment. The 
government’s program in this context consists 
of three policy priorities within the structure 
provided 
by 
the Fiscal Responsibility 
Framework and the strategic plan to rationalize 
public 
bodies: 
(i) 
contain 
government 
expenditures through greater control of public 
sector balances 
and debt; 
(ii) 
address 
constraints in the efficiency of the central 
government financial management and budget 
processes; and (iii) improve tax policy and tax 
administration to reduce tax distortions and 
enhance equity. See Annex 4 for details.  
Key reforms supported by the Bank and other 
development partners are through analysis, 
budgetary support and technical assistance to 
consolidating 
the budget of 
the central 
government and public bodies; rationalizing the 
functions of public bodies and divesting loss 
making commercial entities; containing the 
growth of 
the public sector wage bill; 
enhancing 
the monitoring, evaluation and 
performance of public spending; procurement 
and 
improving accounting and 
financial 
reporting; and improving the prioritization of 
public sector investments. 

G. 

Economic Development and Outlook 

24. 
Past favorable conditions, creative 
entrepreneurship in the tourism sector, and 
a relatively trainer-friendly workforce have 
enabled dynamic expansion in the tourism, 
financial services, telecommunications, and 
entertainment and distribution sectors.  The 
economy is now heavily dominated by services 
(70% of GDP in 2008), of which tourism 
accounts for 6.9 percent.  Other sectors are: 
manufacturing 
(9%); 
construction 
(8%); 
agriculture (6%); and, mining (bauxite, 2% – 
down from 4% due to the global economic 
crisis).  Despite increased competition for the 
two main export crops of sugar and bananas, 

6Public bodies’ fiscal accounts are not consolidated with the central government’s accounts; therefore, debt 
assumed by the central government is referred to as other debt accumulating flows. 

6 

 
 
                                                 
agriculture remains an important source of livelihood for the rural population, albeit 
shrinking.  
25. Macroeconomic resilience to adverse natural events remains weak.  Jamaica’s 
emergency response to disaster events has improved but the fiscal vulnerability to 
adverse natural events remains high. The country would not be able to generate enough 
internal and external financing to replace infrastructure and goods if struck by a category 
4 or 5 hurricane.

26. Overall, Jamaica’s 
growth performance in the 
past 
decade 
has 
consistently lagged behind 
that of key comparators, 
despite favorable conditions 
and 
high 
levels 
of 
investment at 30 percent of 
GDP per year. The country 
has also been adversely 
affected by 
the ongoing 
global crises.  Remittances 
received in 2009 declined by 
11.2 
percent, 
following 
increases every year in the 
past decade. The number of 
tourist arrivals increased by 3.4 percent on an annual basis, while many other Caribbean 
countries experienced significant declines.7  Nevertheless, tourism receipts are down and 
a number of large hotels have been closed. The bauxite industry has collapsed, with three 
of the four alumina factories closed.  By end-2009, a total of 40,000 persons, or 4 percent 
of the 2007 employment level, had been laid off in the formal sector.  Inflation pressures 
are easing, and the annual inflation went down from a peak of 26.5 percent in August 
2008 to 10.2 percent in December 2009. The Jamaican dollar depreciated against the US 
dollar by 23 percent in the eleven months to August 2009, and by 10.2 percent for 
calendar year 2009. The full impact of the crisis has not been documented yet, but its 
social implications look worrisome based on reported increase in property crimes.  In 
this context, the economy contracted by 1.2 percent in calendar year 2008 and is 
estimated to have declined by a further 3.8 percent in 2009 (see Figure 1). 
27. 
A gradual recovery from the current crisis (see Annex B6) and the 
government's program (see Box 2) to put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a clear 
downward path would require a significant multilateral financing package in 
support of a debt reduction policy framework. The government has been 
implementing a major tax reform which includes tax measures and institutional changes 
to increase the tax base, enforce compliance, increase efficiency and effectiveness of the

exchange earnings.

Tax Administration and Customs Department, and thereby boost government fiscal 
revenues. Improvements in debt management and implementation of business reforms 
would also contribute 
to achieving government objectives of fiscal and debt 
sustainability.  
28. 
The economic outlook for the medium-term is of gradual recovery depending 
on global market conditions and the continued commitment to macroeconomic 
stabilization and fiscal reforms.  Under these circumstances, foreign exchange reserves 
are expected to remain steady due to declines in imports, US$330 million SDR grant 
allocation and an IMF Standby Arrangement for US$1.25 billion approved on February 
4, 2010. A multilateral financing package equivalent to 20 percent of GDP is needed to 
reduce interest costs and refinancing risk, which will provide time for government to 
implement necessary reforms to bring the debt ratio into a downward path. The IMF 
program addresses the fiscal imbalance and protection of the social gains by increasing 
and expanding coverage of the country’s flagship conditional cash transfer program.  

H. 

Finance Sector Issues 

29. 
The financial sector is relatively stable and well-capitalized, albeit not free of 
systemic risk. As of June 2009, the solvency indicator was adequate as reflected by the 
capital asset ratio of the banking system, which was 15.4 percent, similar to that observed 
in June 2008 (15.6 percent), and higher than that observed in December 2008 (13.9 
percent). In the twelve months to June 2009, the rate of credit growth was 20 percent, 
which was funded partially by deposits, borrowings (including repos), and a shift in bank 
portfolios away from investments. The return on assets remained largely unchanged over 
the same period. However, there are signs that the Jamaican financial sector has suffered 
from the effects of the international financial crisis. The non-performing loan ratio (NPLs 
over total loans) for commercial banks has increased from 2.2 percent in June 2008 to 3.6 
percent in June 2009. Over the same period, the ratio of provisions for loan losses over 
NPLs declined from 120 percent in June 2008 to 91 percent. Credit to the private sector is 
expected to increase from J$33 billion to J$49 billion between FY08/09 and FY09/10. In 
addition, the central bank has provided an emergency credit line to financial firms that 
were suffering dollar liquidity constraints due to a drop in the value of collateral, from 
which US$168 million was drawn. The government has also accessed the IDB’s Growth 
Stability Fund for US$200 million for on-lending to commercial financial institutions to 
support credit to firms that suffer financial constraints from the loss of suppliers’ credits. 
30. 
In past years, burgeoning pyramid schemes constituted a threat to financial 
sector stability, but the collapse of some of these schemes has substantially 
decreased their attractiveness to the public. Perhaps the most relevant systemic risk 
today is the high dependency of the domestic financial system on government debt, 
which accounts for almost 80 percent of their liquid assets. Careful monitoring is required 
because of the financial sector sensitivity to government performance and vice versa.  
Furthermore, risks related to conglomerates could lead to real sector contagion, and 
hidden risks could jeopardize the stability of the financial system.  In other words, while 
banks may appear solid, their real sector operations may not be.  This issue suggests the 
need to intensify oversight of the financial sector for related party transactions of 
conglomerates and non-bank financial institutions. 

8 

 
 
I. 

Telecommunication Sector Issues 

31. 
The telecommunications sector growth momentum is limited by relatively 
low broadband access in the country.  Inclusion of new mobile operators in 2000 has 
increased mobile penetration from 14.2 per 100 persons in December 2000 to 101.3 in 
2008, in part, reflecting the prevalence of more than one cell phone per person because of 
high intra-network connection charges.  However, broadband penetration remains low at 
3.6 subscribers per 100 inhabitants. Some potential causes of this relatively low 
penetration could include: (i) high international connectivity prices due to lack of 
capacity and competition; (ii) unavailability of nationwide backbone networks; and (iii) 
artificial barriers through inefficient regulation. 

J. 

Environment and Disaster Management 

32. 
Jamaica is vulnerable to climate change and its environment has suffered 
from years of resource constraints. The country continues to make progress in 
integrating sustainable development principles in policies and programs, raising public 
awareness of these principles, and working to address environmental threats.  However, 
overall weak coordination, a lack of clarity in key institutional roles and responsibilities, 
and poor enforcement of legislation and regulation are slowing progress in the 
implementation of environmental policies. Private ownership of large parts of the country 
constrains biodiversity management; 
inadequate funding; and 
lack of political 
commitment and limited human resource capacity impede forest management. Solid 
waste management issues are emerging in cities like Kingston and in urban towns. Issues 
relating to disaster risks and potential climate change impacts require further scrutiny.   
33. 
Potential exists to build on, and extend, the Use of Country Systems for 
environmental and social safeguards.  The Bank is piloting the Use of Country Systems 
with the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF), which adopted policies equivalent to the 
Bank’s environmental and involuntary resettlement safeguards.  The diagnostic work and 
institutional strengthening measures undertaken with JSIF were pivotal in JSIF becoming 
the only public entity in the region to receive an ISO 14001 certification for 
environmental management systems in January 2009. The Bank can capitalize on the 
positive experience to scale up this initiative to other agencies. The government has 
expressed interest in getting support to strengthen institutional capacity to coordinate and 
oversee environmental management processes.   
34. 
The cost of natural disasters is high and disaster management is becoming a 
priority for the government.  Hurricanes thus far have been costly and the damages 
they cause are sometimes permanent, usually resulting from coastal storm surge and flash 
floods. Seismic risk is also particularly significant in the Kingston metropolitan area, 
which was previously devastated by an earthquake in 1907. The Kingston metropolitan 
area now holds a large concentration of critical infrastructure, including the harbor and 
airport, built on reclaimed land prone to liquefaction. Recent studies have shown the need 
to revise seismic hazard maps and building policies -- new building codes were recently 
completed.

III. DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND GOVERNMENT VISION  

35. 
The three critical development challenges for the government are to: (i) 
mitigate the medium-term effects of the global economic crisis; (ii) protect social 
gains while moving towards fiscal and debt sustainability; and, (iii) lay a foundation 
for inclusive and sustained growth over the medium term.  To these ends, the 
government has articulated an ambitious long-term strategy, Vision 2030, and an 
associated Medium-Term Socioeconomic Policy Framework (MTF, FY09-12) with 
intermediate steps that will support the longer term vision. The economic environment is 
fundamentally different from when the process began four years ago, but the broad 
thrusts of the articulated strategy remain valid. Vision 2030 aims at shifting the economy 
from one based exclusively on exploiting “basic factors” – sun and sand tourism, mineral 
deposits and basic agricultural commodities – to one that is increasingly based on higher 
forms of capital including cultural, human, knowledge and institutional to take the 
country to OECD standards of living.  The medium-term strategy identifies six national 
outcomes, five supporting national outcomes,8 and one hundred and fifty-two goals.  The 
national outcomes and goals are linked to the proposed CPS sub-pillars, and current 
identified sources of support by the IDPs are highlighted in Table 2.   

A. 

Achieving Economic Stability 

36. 
Improving fiscal and debt sustainability in order to reduce debt overhang and 
reverse the weak growth trajectory is high priority in Jamaica, and addressing 
governance and corruption issues are integral to achieving this objective. For 
example, 3 percent of income tax payers account for over 80 percent of income tax 
revenues while significant revenue is lost at important public institutions. Overall, the 
public institutions are relatively strong, but the perception of corruption is increasing.   
Improvements in the public financial management and procurement systems not 
only improve the efficiency of public spending but also drastically reduce the scope 
for corruption.  According to the 2006 CFAA/CPAR, the principal weaknesses in public 
financial management include: (i) lack of forward looking budget and prioritization of 
expenditures; (ii) lack of hard budget constraints for public bodies; (iii) significant 
divergence between the original approved budget estimates and what is actually 
implemented; (iv) delays in reporting of the accounting, auditing and publication of 
results; and, (v) while accounting, recording and reporting standards exist, these are not 
in line with international standards.  The government is aware of these limitations and is 
carrying out activities with technical assistance to address some of them. Additional 
assistance is required, however. 

8 The supporting national outcomes the government wishes to achieve are: (i) an enabling business 
environment; (ii) internationally competitive industry structures; (iii) hazard risk reduction and adaptation 
to climate change; (iv) effective social protection; and, (v) authentic and transformational culture.

Public procurement policy has improved but scope remains for further 
improvement.  The 2006 CFAA/CPAR noted that significant improvement is needed for 
increased transparency, particularly on procurement performance and monitoring.9 A 
large number of public bodies are involved in the approval process, causing expensive 
contracts in the process and a longer period to complete a project. The CPAR 
recommendations, still valid, are: (i) enhancing public procurement performance and 
monitoring; (ii) improving supplier registration; (iii) developing reliable and consistent 
statistics on procurement; and, (iv) intensifying efforts to create a cadre of qualified 
procurement officers. Any reforms must be accompanied by capacity building on broader 
procurement issues and contract management, particularly in the implementing agencies.  
38. 
National outcome I on a stable macro-economy is critical in Jamaica’s longer-
term development and a central objective is to begin to turn around some of the main 
macro issues that have plagued the country since the 1970s.  To protect macroeconomic 
stability and confidence in markets, the government is implementing a 27-month IMF 
Standby Arrangement, which includes provision to expand social spending. Ongoing 
Bank operations such as the social protection, inner cities basic services and the 
emergency recovery projects will help to protect social gains and provide much needed 
employment.  Other donors, such as the CDB, IDB and EU are also providing budget and 
additional programs to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and protect social gains.  
39. 
In addition, the government is moving towards bringing Parliamentary 
oversight over the consolidated public sector account and working towards adopting a 
fiscal responsibility framework.  Also, IDB, USAID, US Treasury and the Internal 
Revenue Service have provided technical assistance on revenue collections and 
management while the Bank has provided non-lending technical assistance on 
strengthening debt management.  

B. 

Promoting Inclusive Growth 

40. 
Strengthening human capital would address the issue of relatively low level of 
education and skill gaps, a major impediment to growth.  The 2008 Labour Force 
Survey confirms that 68 percent of the work force has passed no examination10 and 72 
percent received no training.  In addition, the social capital is weak, which reflects the 
family structure and the low trust environment in the Jamaican society. Personal 
depression level is also high – for example, 26 percent of women and 15 percent of men 
suffer from depression,11 which may contribute to lower productivity. These longstanding 
social deficits contributed to the decline in labor productivity over the period 1973-
2007.12 

9 In early 2008, the Bank was advised during the Results Based CPPR discussion that such a system is 
being put in place for JSIF projects. 
10 The introduction of the Caribbean Certificate of Secondary Level Competency allows students to leave 
secondary schools with a certificate that demonstrates learning of minimum skills and information.  In the 
2008 CXC examinations only 16.7% of boys and 30.1% of girls passed five subjects or more, including 
English language and math, an indication of low levels of basic skills when students leave secondary 
school.

41. 
The challenge the government faces is to prioritize between pre- and tertiary 
level education for funding with its limited resources, and it has chosen the former.  
The government is funding early childhood development, where the country is a pioneer 
in the region, and is embarking on a complete overhaul of the pre-tertiary system. The 
objective is to move away from centralized decision making, without sufficient attention 
to quality, to one of increased accountability throughout the system, by devolving 
decision-making authority to the regional level, increasing the capacity of the teachers 
and administrators, and providing more targeted support to schools.  Bipartisan support 
exists for this strategic focus as the current, two-shift education system needs to be 
urgently replaced by one where children learn and develop social skills. The Ministry of 
Education is launching a National Parenting Commission to assist parents to be more 
actively involved in the education of their children. 
42. 
The shift in education priority implies that tertiary institutions need to find 
creative ways to educate the future workforce in a competitive environment.  While 
primary and secondary education is free in Jamaica and early childhood mostly paid for 
privately, tertiary education has been subsidized. A government student loan facility is 
available for tertiary education. Given the fiscal pressure, the government is redirecting 
its resources to pre-tertiary education. Under these circumstances, public-private 
partnership is critical to design and implement policies and programs to strengthen skills 
for school leavers and for those already in the labor market.  The Bank, CDB, IDB, IFC, 
UNICEF and USAID are supporting these education transformations, with IFC focusing 
on public-private partnership potential.  
43. 
Jamaica has a good network of primary health care facilities but faces 
increased challenge in terms of human and financial resources.  The primary health 
care infrastructure reaches deep into rural areas; however, resource constraints and 
shortages of local medical professionals, due to emigration, are straining the health care 
system’s ability to provide timely and quality care.  Shortages in the country are filled by 
Asian medical professionals as the domestic training system is not geared to train 
increased numbers of medical professionals.  The abolishment of user fees at public 
health facilities in 2008, in keeping with an election pledge, has significantly increased 
demand for health services and the government is facing fiscal challenges to sustain this 
service.   
44. 
Jamaica’s incidence of HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases is 
relatively high.  HIV/AIDS remains a major threat in Jamaica, with an unchanged 
prevalence rate of 1.6 percent among the 15-49 age group.  Early initiation of sexual 
activity and high multiple partners contribute to this prevalence even though condom use 
in the same age group is quite high at 66.3 percent for women and 83.5 percent for men. 
At the same time, non-communicable diseases such as heart attacks, stroke, diabetes and 
hypertension contribute to over 60 percent of the burden of disease.  Only 19 percent of 
Jamaicans between 15 and 74 years old have private health insurance.  The Bank, 
UNAIDS and the Global Fund are all supporting the government on HIV/AIDS. 
Additionally, the Bank is analyzing non-communicable diseases that could lead to future 
support for the health sector. 
45. 
To address human capital issues, the government has identified national 
outcome II: World class education and training. This outcome aims to expand and 

13 

 
 
improve the quality of education by way of the Education Transformation Program (ETP) 
and the Early Childhood Development Project. These programs aim to improve the 
quality and relevance of the country’s education system. Re-training, skill development 
and certifying the labor force is a key success factor for economic stability and growth. 
The early childhood development program is support by CDB, OAS, UNICEF and the 
World Bank.  The wide-ranging education reform is being initiated with support from the 
IDB, USAID, UNICEF and the World Bank.  
46. 
Crime and violence prevention is one of the most fundamental development 
challenges that faces Jamaica today and the government is vigorously seeking effective 
ways to reduce crime and strengthen the rule of law.  The high incidence of crime and 
violence is a reflection of social fragmentation, and it has hindered economic and civic 
activities in inner city communities. The occupational profile of persons arrested for 
major crimes confirm disproportionate representation of elementary occupations – i.e., 
the least skilled, least educated and, therefore, the most vulnerable section of the labor 
force.  This situation reinforces the need for quality education and crime and violence 
prevention measures. 
47. 
The national outcome III on greater security and safety aims to restore a sense 
of safety and cohesion to Jamaican society through a significant reduction in the crime, 
violence and civil disturbances, which have led to social fragmentation, increased poverty 
and reduced economic activities especially in the inner cities.  A number of projects and 
programs are supported in these areas by DFID, EU, IDB, UNDP, USAID and the World 
Bank. Resources needed are significant and there is a need for an integrated approach. 
48. 
The national outcome IV on effective governance aims to strengthen public 
sector effectiveness overall, but also includes a special focus on strengthening the justice 
system.  The government recognizes that a key component in achieving more effective 
governance is a reduction in the incidence and perception of corruption.  To this end, a 
national integrity action forum has been established with bipartisan and civil society 
support and the government is implementing wide-ranging reform of the justice system 
with support from CIDA, EU, IDB, and UNDP. To make any significant progress on 
governance it is important to disrupt the relationship between organized crime on the one 
hand and inner-city communities, the police, the political and public procurement system 
on the other. It would also be important to raise the levels of social trust to enhance the 
stock of social capital and secure effective social partnership.13  Sectoral strategies need 
to be developed and are expected with support from IDPs including the World Bank.   
49. 
Promoting rural development is high priority for the government as the 
agriculture sector is not contributing its potential and urban crime is increasingly 
moving to rural areas.  Agriculture has historically been centered on large scale sugar 
and banana exports under European trade preferences, which have now ceased. 
Alternatives are needed to resuscitate rural economy and incomes, to prevent further 
movement of people to the over-crowded urban areas.  Small scale agriculture does 

13 Jamaica ranks among the lowest trusting societies globally: 83 percent of Jamaicans in a recent survey 
disagree that most people in society are trustworthy (Political Culture of Democracy in Jamaica, 
University of the West Indies Press, 2008) compared with an average of 52 percent in a Pew survey of 47 
countries around the world.   

14 

 
 
                                                 
exhibit significant potential for growth, particularly in the domestic market where it could 
displace high cost imports. Additionally, a shift in agriculture would also facilitate 
alternative crop substitution to more effectively displace marijuana cultivation, which has 
been long prevalent in some rural parishes. The agriculture sector will, however, need to 
be strengthened through technology transfer and infrastructure improvements to become 
competitive. 
50. Key challenges that need to be addressed for further agricultural growth and 
development are: (i) improving productivity by replacing inefficient production 
practices and outdated technology; (ii) improving market infrastructure to lower post-
harvest and logistical costs; (iii) addressing the problem of praedial larceny;14 (iv) 
improving the public and private financial management of weather-related agriculture 
risks; (v) improving the targeting and efficiency of public expenditures in the agriculture 
sector to promote competitiveness; and (vi) diversification of agriculture and rural 
economy that would include: (a) promotion of climate resilient agriculture such as 
hurricane-resistant crops, salt and drought tolerant crops, and (b) promotion and capture 
of the value-added agro-processing opportunities. These challenges will be addressed 
mainly through the ongoing rural economic development project and the technical 
assistance work on agricultural risk management. Praedial larceny will be considered 
through the proposed crime and violence project. 
51. 
The supporting national outcome I focuses on internationally competitive 
industry structures including development of the agriculture sector. The goals include 
promotion of national food security and strengthening of efforts to reduce praedial 
larceny. 

C. 

Promoting Sustained Growth 

52. 
Strengthening non-labor competitiveness would be important to achieve 
sustained growth. In the financial sector, there exists: (i) inadequate regulations to 
monitor the strength and performance of the large regional financial institutions that 
dominate Jamaica and 
the Caribbean 
including possible contagion from other 
jurisdictions and via related parties; (ii) inadequate private sector participation in micro-, 
small- and mid-sized enterprise (MSME) lending, partly because of insufficient product 
knowledge, but also because the government’s debt and monetary policy may undermine 
commercial bank lending; (iii) the continued absence of a Jamaican or Caribbean credit 
bureau to help improve access to credit; and, (iv) the absence of unsecured risk taking 
instruments (equity and quasi-equity) to support the needs of the SME sector. The 
government has made progress toward preparing credit bureau legislation, with support 
from the IFC and IDB.  Some of the broader financial sector regulations, stemming from 
the 2005 FSAP report, are the subject of an IMF Financial Sector Program. 
53. 
The high cost of electricity is a significant impediment to Jamaica’s 
competitiveness.  At 34 US cents per kWh in Jamaica (compared to 3 cents in Trinidad 
and Tobago, its main competitor in the region for light manufacturing), the cost of energy 
adversely affects the welfare of the population and the country’s competitiveness.  High 

14 Praedial larceny is theft of agricultural produce and livestock; estimated to cost about US$60 million 
annually. 

15 

 
 
                                                 
energy costs are due to a combination of the choice of imported fuel, inefficient 
generation and distribution infrastructure, electricity theft, and weakness in sector 
regulation that does not provide incentive for the operator to minimize costs. Tourism and 
hotels (45%) and the bauxite and alumina (40%) account for the bulk of the electricity 
demand.  It is estimated that Jamaica will need to commission 200-300MW of additional 
generation capacity in the next 3-5 years to meet demand and also to replace costly 
generating installations, on the assumption that the bauxite industry will recover.  The 
government has recently decided to promote LNG as the choice for future energy 
generation and has sought Bank and IFC support in energy risk management, reducing 
the cost of electricity and increasing overall supply under economic terms. The IDB will 
also support energy conservation. 
54. 
Jamaica’s competitiveness is impacted by low broadband penetration in the 
telecommunication sector. The two submarine cables that currently serve Jamaica are 
reaching their maximum capacity. Proposed projects to expand or install new submarine 
cables are at a strong risk of being delayed or cancelled with their long-term economic 
viability threatened. Yet, broadband access is important to leverage opportunities for 
trade and competitiveness, economic diversification and social development.  
55. 
The high cost associated with the administration of tax is also a major 
constraint to doing business in Jamaica. The government is implementing a tax 
administration reform, which would, for example, reduce the need to retain a full-time 
staff one day a week for a full year to make various tax payments. The IMF, IDB and 
USAID are in support of the simplification of the tax payment procedures, which should 
improve the business climate. The Bank also provided a reform memorandum and will 
support this initiative with technical assistance as needed. 
56. 
National outcome V on strong economic infrastructure aims to foster the 
development of an integrative role for transport, telecommunications and water 
infrastructure in economic development. This outcome is being supported by Belgium, 
CDB, EU, IDB, Japan, USAID, Venezuela and World Bank. Despite the heavy 
concentration of IDPs, several important areas remain unsupported. For example, the 
strategy for expanding domestic and international air transport infrastructure and services 
is being supported by CDB but only for financing the Norman Manley Airport terminal; 
CDB’s financing of the Palisades approach road to the airport is being replaced by 
resources from China. This situation reinforces the difficulty with which the government 
will have to achieve its medium-term objectives with its limited fiscal resources and the 
need to explore Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in a broad range of sectors.   
57. 
National outcome VI on energy security and efficiency aims to foster energy 
diversification, and promote energy efficiency and conservation with support from IDB, 
IFC, PetroCaribe, and the World Bank.  The IFC and the Bank are exploring PPP options 
in energy.  Facilitating growth with equity, particularly in uplifting and empowering the 
lowest quintiles through strengthened MSMEs, is essential to the national goal of a safe, 
cohesive, and just society. 
58. 
Climate change and vulnerability are major challenges for Jamaica. Climate 
variability will exacerbate existing disaster risk, especially in coastal areas some of 
which are among the most vulnerable and are characterized by high levels of poverty, 

16 

 
 
environmental degradation and indiscriminate land use practices.  Higher sea levels will 
compound the storm surge risk, which may also rise with the potential for stronger or 
more frequent storms.  Sea-level rise will also be associated with saline intrusion into 
coastal aquifers, affecting the availability of freshwater and increasing water stress. Coral 
bleaching will also impact ecosystems, and livelihoods from tourism and fisheries. The 
latest Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections indicates a 
reduction in precipitation in Jamaica throughout the year, with the largest reductions 
occurring in the summer. The expected reductions in precipitation along with an increase 
in the intensity of rains will affect slope stability, landslide and flood risks, and cause 
water availability, storage and delivery problems. 
59. 
Systematic weather risks, especially hurricanes and associated wind damages 
set back the income and capitalization gains achieved by farmers, making it harder 
for farmers 
to sustain 
income growth 
in 
the medium- 
to 
long-term, 
losing 
competitiveness and affecting households’ consumption, as well as, widespread 
destruction of rural infrastructure.  However, the challenge of the financial management 
and transfer of weather risks in the agriculture sector is compounded by the prevalence of 
micro-climates in areas, such as the Blue Mountains.   
60. 
Vulnerability of public infrastructure and housing to hurricanes and 
earthquakes is growing. The economic losses associated with earthquakes and 
hurricanes in Jamaica are well documented and show a rising trend, primarily due to an 
increase in vulnerable structures because of physical deficiency and their location.  In 

addition, a high percentage of the population and much critical infrastructure are located along 

the coast implying that crucial economic assets are highly exposed to tropical storms and 
hurricanes. Hurricane Dean is estimated to have resulted in losses of more than US$300 
million in 2007, including damages to more than 500 schools and public educational 
institutions. Similar strength hurricanes will on average make landfall in Jamaica once 
every decade. Jamaica can reduce the economic impact and social disruption of future 
hurricanes and earthquakes by: (i) investing in the reduction of existing vulnerability of 
its public infrastructure; and, (ii) ensuring stricter enforcement of its physical planning 
laws and regulations, including identification of “No Build Zones,” in order to minimize 
life and property damage from both inland and coastal flooding and flood events.  The 
Bank is supporting development of a regional risk atlas for hazard risk management, a 
pilot program for risk reduction and, with IDB, a Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. 
61. 
Sustained growth also requires addressing the underperformance of boys in 
school and their engagement in risky behaviors at early age. The Bank’s program 
addresses the issue of youth at risk with an emphasis on boys through the following 
actions: (i) knowledge exchange and identifying best practices as part of a Caribbean 
regional initiative to keep boys out of risk; (ii) engaging with policy makers in Jamaica 
including representatives from the Youth Ministry, Education Ministry, and academia, to 
follow up on dissemination of best practices. These are also specific follow up actions for 
Jamaica agreed upon at a regional workshop in 2009 in a Common Platform for Action to 
keep Boys out of Risk. The Bank team is working in partnership with other donors and 
the Commonwealth Secretariat to organize conferences and events; (iii) including a youth 
at risk perspective and a special focus on boys in World Bank education projects, school 
to work transition, and skills development projects or technical assistance.   

17 

 
 
D. 

Strengthening Governance 

62. 
Despite a national integrity forum, there is no well-articulated national or 
agency-specific strategy in Jamaica. There is need to: (i) strengthen the legislative 
framework (e.g., the whistle-blower and conflict of interest rules in public bodies’ 
legislation); (ii) establish public trust in the justice and the police systems; and, (iii) 
ensure timelier, successful detection, investigation, prosecution and punishment for 
corruption practices. An IDF grant has been earmarked to assist the government in 
developing a bipartisan governance and anti-corruption strategy for selected public 
institutions. 

IV. 

JAMAICA-WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP  

A. 

The Program under CAS, FY05-09 

63. 
The FY05-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) program was designed 
around three Pillars and two cross-cutting themes (see Annex 5). These were: (i) 
Pillar 
I: Accelerating 
Inclusive Economic Growth supported achievement of 
macroeconomic stability, and reduction of poverty and increased social inclusion for the 
poor; (ii) Pillar II: Improving Human Development and Opportunity supported improved 
access to and quality of education, and HIV/AIDS prevention and care; and (iii) Pillar III: 
Crime Prevention and Reduction supported an effective community crime prevention 
system. The Governance theme included enhanced public sector efficiency, expansion of 
participatory 
framework and 
improved accountability and 
transparency. The 
environmental sustainability theme supported enhancing government’s capacity to 
respond to natural catastrophes and mainstreaming environmental consideration in 
investment planning.  
64. 
During this period, the World Bank approved five investment loans and one DPL 
for a total of US$204.3 million. Jamaica also benefited from four national and seven 
regional AAAs, as well as, a number of trust fund grants. IFC actively engaged in 
transactions in the financial sector (including SME financing) and infrastructure (energy 
and airport) with six projects for a total financing of US$192 million, including US$70 
million from participating banks. MIGA also approved two guarantee insurance cover. 

B. 

Summary Findings of the CAS Completion Report 

65. 
The Bank’s program in CAS FY05-09 was aligned with the government’s 
MTF, FY04-09, and it sought to contribute to eight strategic objectives based on the 
MTF.  The CAS Progress Report of July 2007 presented a Results Matrix with 12 
outcomes. These outcomes were intended to be achieved through 10 lending operations 
and 12 studies, of which 6 had a country-focus and 6 had a regional scope. Later, in 
response to government requests, the Bank: (i) approved the Hurricane Dean Emergency 
Recovery Program (ERP), a follow-on HIV/AIDS project, and several Trust Funds; (ii) 
produced an electricity policy note; and, (iii) undertook studies for parametric risk 
insurance for coffee and agriculture in general.  The country also benefited from the 
ongoing regional work on risk atlas for hazard risk management. 

18 

 
 
66. 
The CAS Completion Report concludes that the performance over the CAS 
period was mixed at best when judged against the goals outlined in MTF, FY04-09.  
While some modest gains were made in streamlining and better targeting Jamaica’s social 
programs, 
there was virtually no progress 
toward 
the objective of achieving 
macroeconomic stability. Of particular concern in that regard are the adverse trends in 
indicators concerning national debt, fiscal balances, growth and inflation.  The outcomes 
are described fully in the CAS Completion Report (Annex 5). 
67. 
Portfolio assessments, in terms of outcomes, delivery targets, budget 
performance and disbursements are considered fully satisfactory.  Without exception, 
both government officials and other stakeholders were appreciative of the recent 
strengthening of the Bank office in Jamaica and felt that it had greatly helped in 
improving the country dialogue as well as interaction among external partners.   
68. 
The performance under FY05-09 CAS suggests six lessons for the future: (i) 
realistic outcomes target setting in the partnership strategy, paying due attention to the 
financial and institutional constraints as well as to Jamaica’s high vulnerability to natural 
hazards; (ii) projects dimensioned bearing in mind Jamaica’s fiscal constraints; a 
successful project can always be scaled up as a repeater project or through additional 
financing; (iii) revisit sectoral priorities to ensure that focus on social sectors is 
complemented by due attention to growth issues together with issues of governance and 
corruption; (iv) strengthen supervision of fiduciary aspects especially procurement, if 
possible, through further decentralization through a mini-hub with the Caribbean 
countries; (v) ensure adequate dissemination and outreach for analytical and advisory 
work; and, (vi) further strengthen aid coordination, especially vis-à-vis IDB and EU, and 
explore the possibility of a joint CAS by the key partners.

 The World Bank Group active in Jamaica includes the IBRD, IFC and 
MIGA. The World Bank portfolio in Jamaica includes 
seven IBRD projects totaling US$135.3 million, focused 
on strategic interventions with innovative features. The 
lending portfolio is relatively new with a disbursement 
ratio of 22 percent or US$30 million. In addition, five 
grants for US$6 million, and an additional two regional 
grants for which Jamaica is also a beneficiary for a total of 
US$1.45 million. The IBRD 
investment 
lending 
is 
highlighted in Table 3.

All project and grants under implementation 
are making satisfactory progress.  All operations are 
rated “Satisfactory” or “Moderately Satisfactory” for 
overall implementation and progress toward achieving 
development objectives.  The Trust Fund activities are 
important but get least attention from a weak institutional 
structure in the country and do not attract the same level of supervision. Hence, it is 
important to seek partners as is being explored with the UNDP and USAID for the IDF

“Moderately Satisfactory” ratings for both Procurement and Financial Management.  
These ratings reflect increased in-country trainings provided and networking among 
implementing agencies facilitated since upgrading of the Bank office in 2008.

Jamaica is currently IFC’s second largest country exposure in the English-
Speaking Caribbean, closely behind Trinidad and Tobago. At the end of December 
2009, IFC's disbursed and held portfolios totaled US$109 million and US$137 million, 
respectively. Syndicated loans (B loans), for which IFC is lender of record, amounted to 
US$72 million also at the end of December 2009. In FY08, IFC committed US$17.5 
million new financing into First Jamaica’s residential and commercial real estate 
development projects. In FY09, IFC signed US$25 million in new commitments in 
Jamaica.   
72. 
Demand for IFC’s support has been particularly strong in infrastructure and 
the financial sector. In infrastructure, IFC committed US$46 million in investment 
(including US$20 million from syndicating banks) for the three-phase upgrade and 
expansion of the Sangster Airport in Montego Bay, the first privatized airport in the 
English-Speaking Caribbean. The project is expected to help increase the airport’s 
capacity to nine million passengers per year, sufficient to accommodate Jamaica’s 
expected growth in tourism traffic for the foreseeable future. Additionally, IFC 
committed US$123 million (of which US$50 million is from syndicating banks) in two 
projects to support the expansion and restructuring of independent power production and 
distribution. This represents a total financing of US$169 million in FY03-FY09.15 
73. 
IFC committed US$30 million to National Commercial Bank of Jamaica (NCBJ), 
a leading local bank, to support its diversification of funding sources and strengthen its 
balance sheet.  In addition, US$20 million – a preferred share subscription of $10 million 
and a US$10 million loan – was committed to First Global Bank.  With IFC’s financial 
and advisory support, the bank will augment the level of credit made available to 
MSMEs, enhancing the still modest 21 percent of Jamaica’s banking penetration. First 
Global expects to generate 240 SME loans for a total of US$55.5 million. 
74. 
IFC’s advisory portfolio focuses on the Air Jamaica Privatization Project as well 
as increasing the access to finance.  IFC is mandated by the government to design and 
implement the privatization strategy for the national airline, Air Jamaica. The 
privatization of the airline is one of the government’s key objectives.  Air Jamaica plays a 
significant role in Jamaica's aviation sector with over 45 percent market share (1.7 
million annual passengers).  However, the company represents a significant burden on the 
government's fiscal account (on average, US$15 million per month). As part of its 
regional credit bureau program, IFC advised government on a proposed credit bureau 
legislation. When enacted, this legislation should facilitate the availability of credit to 
currently underserved segments of society. IFC recently signed an advisory agreement 
with one of Jamaica’s largest microfinance institutions to provide diagnostics and 
strategic advice to increase its reach.  

15 While committed in Trinidad & Tobago, the IFC’s US$37 million to the cement company TCL was used 
to upgrade and double the clinker capacity of its Jamaican plant.

75. MIGA has provided cumulative guarantees of US$275 million in Jamaica 
since 1992.  The portfolio fell from US$169 million at end-FY07 to a total guarantee 
exposure of US$72 million at end-2008 as a result of guarantees expiring as debt were 
amortized for underwritten power projects.  The outstanding projects are guarantees for 
the financing for the expansion of two stages of Kingston Port Container Terminal.  

D. 

International Development Partners 

76. 
A total of seventeen IDPs16 are active in twelve sectors with most support 
directed to the social sector (39%), followed by budgetary support (30%) with 
strong support for growth and competitiveness.  In 2008, ongoing development 
partner support amounted to US$2.1 billion, of which 18.6 percent was grant.  As of end-
2008, the largest development partner was IDB with US$673 million, followed by 
Venezuela17 with US$410 million, CDB with US$314 million, the EU with US$257 
million and the World Bank with US$120 million. In addition, Japan provided significant 
amount of PHRD and JSDF grants through the World Bank. 
77. 
Two bilateral IDPs (CIDA and DFID) have regional strategies while USAID, 
IDB and the World Bank have country strategies.  All strategies and sectoral support 
are provided in line with government priorities articulated through the PIOJ and in the 
MTF.   
78. 
The depth of coordination among IDPs has increased, particularly since the 
2008 upgrading and strengthening of the Bank country office. The Bank participates in 
the annual retreat with the government and development partners, and it chairs the 
thematic group on Debt and Growth.  The IFC co-located with the World Bank in August 
2009. In doing so, the World Bank Group will strengthen coordination and increase 
access to its advisory services, public-private partnerships work, and foster deeper private 
sector development.   

E. 

CPS Consultations 

79. World Bank Group held extensive stakeholder consultations in July 2009 
with key stakeholders. A total of 116 people were consulted including thirty-one 
members of Parliament in a joint session. The other stakeholders were representatives of: 
government (29), private sector (17), civil society (13), trade unions (12), youth (8), and 
other international development partners (6).   
80. 
Stakeholders identified six top priority areas for support: (i) debt and fiscal 
sustainability to achieve economic stability and the fiscal space needed to undertake 
critical public sector investment in support of higher level of development; (ii) crime and 
violence, which deter productive investment and growth; (iii) environment and disaster 
management, which impact directly the well being of citizens and fiscal stability through 
higher costs of rehabilitation and recovery programs after major disasters; (iv) rural

incidence of poverty in the rural areas; (v) human capital development, which is critical 
to improving Jamaica’s competitiveness; and (vi) cost of energy, which is critical to 
improving citizens’ welfare and competitiveness18.

The indicative Bank Group support for FY10-13 is based on: (i) the government’s 
own priorities articulated in its MTF, (ii) consideration of opportunities for deeper 
partnerships 
with 
other IDPs, (iii) the 
recommendations of 
the CAS Completion 
Report, 
and 
(iv) 
lessons from ongoing 
projects. The Bank is 
also mindful that it is 
small in terms of the 
financial resources it 
provides to Jamaica, 
accounting 
for 
5 
percent of on-going 
IDP 
supported 
projects 
and 
programs 
in 
the 
public sector. The 
CPS, 
therefore, 
seeks to continue to 
pay attention to Bank comparative knowledge and technical support, which has 
been highly valued by Jamaicans in the past.   
82. World Bank support will: (i) remain focused on programs to maintain social 
stability and strengthen human capital in an environment of tight fiscal space and 
(ii) broaden to address fiscal and debt sustainability issues, the growth agenda and 
deepen efforts in crime and violence prevention. Jamaica’s fiscal space remains 
limited and the interventions identified in the Partnership Strategy have been carefully 
chosen to help the government achieve its objectives while mindful of its limited human 
and financial resources, as well as limited Bank budget. The size and focus of the support 
will be predicated on the country’s debt and fiscal situation, as further deterioration could 
adversely impact the level of private sector investment and thereby the level of IFC 
investment activities.  The Bank’s Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability Series (DPL1 and 
2, and possibly DPL 3), which supports the government’s medium-term fiscal and debt 
sustainability reform program, will be a cornerstone for optimizing Bank Group synergies 
in Jamaica.

83. 
The World Bank country envelope for Jamaica is known for only the first 
year. The lending plans over the partnership period are indicative as it has always been. 
The Bank’s capacity to lend can change over time and there is a higher degree of 
certainty that lending plans indicated for the earlier years of the CPS period can be 
delivered than those for the later years. The proposed pipeline is a careful balance 
between DPL, investment lending and TA support (see Table 4). 
84. 
Through this CPS, the World Bank Group aims at (i) supporting economic 
stability and (ii) promoting inclusive and sustained growth, with a particular focus on 
strengthening governance. While this strategy will continue or scale up successful 
support from the previous strategy, it has more focus on the growth agenda, compared to 
the previous strategy, and deeper human capital development and competitiveness focus 
(see Annex 2: CPS Results Chain).   
Pillar I: Supporting Economic Stability, Results Area 1: Fiscal and Debt Sustainability 
85. 
The CPS seeks to contribute to achieve the following outcomes: 
 Medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability enhanced through fiscal consolidation 
and enhanced fiscal reporting and accountability. Bank support will seek the 
establishment of an institutional framework for the consolidation of all public body 
accounts into central government budget process, and will support the government to 
publish a consolidated public sector budget for presentation in Parliament. Approval 
of a Fiscal Responsibility Framework (FRF) in this context will improve fiscal 
discipline and budgetary process. Currently, the public bodies’ expenditures exceed 
that of the central government and their significant deficits contribute to government 
contingent liabilities. 
 Improved fiscal and debt sustainability over the medium-term through decline in 
total public debt-to-GDP ratio and reducing debt service and debt burden through 
debt management activities. The Bank will continue to support the government with 
debt management and tax administration to achieve improvements in its overall fiscal 
deficit from 12.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.5 percent in 2013, and the debt-to-GDP 
ratio from 139.7 percent to 124.2 percent over the same period. To these ends, the 
Bank will continue to support the government with its fiscal and debt sustainability 
reform program with two or three additional DPLs, and possibly an associated TA to 
support expeditious implementation of the government’s reform agenda. The TA will 
finance, among other areas to be agreed with the government, debt management, tax 
administration and aspects of doing business. The Bank has already submitted reform 
memoranda for debt management and doing business, and the USAID has submitted 
reform agenda in tax administration.  Bank Group support in these areas will be in 
close collaboration with CDB, DFID, IDB, UNDP and USAID.  In addition, a 
Country Economic Memorandum in FY10 will focus on debt sustainability and 
growth agenda, and inform support under the next DPL. The Bank will also seek IDF 
funding for debt and tax management. The governance IDF will also contribute to the 

19 In addition, Jamaica could be included in the Caribbean Advanced Regional Communications 
Infrastructure Program. 
20 The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience is financed through a mixture of both grants and concessional 
funding on IDA-like terms.

economic stability pillar. The Bank may also provide additional non-lending technical 
assistance, including monitoring and evaluation of debt through the DeMPA program. 
 Abolition of deferred financing for government expenditures. The Bank will seek 
the enactment of the legislation abolishing the authority to permit deferred financing. 
Pillar II: Promoting Inclusive Growth, Results Area 2: Strengthening Human Capital 
86. 
The CPS seeks to contribute to achieve the following outcomes:   
 Enhanced resource management and quality of education to be improved through 
decentralized decision-making in the education system. This is one of the examples 
where Bank and IFC programs are fully integrated in this CPS.  The Bank will 
support establishment of the necessary infrastructure for a more decentralized 
education system in Jamaica, while the IFC is discussing public-private partnership 
(PPP) advisory services for schools with a view to improving the quality and access 
of secondary education.  The main purpose of this effort would be to construct new 
schools under the PPP schemes to eliminate the shift system. The cooperation 
agreement recently signed with CIDA offers an opportunity for expanded advisory 
services. IFC will also focus on the emerging information technology sector. 
 Quality of services by the early childhood institutions enhanced through 
compliance of minimum standards required for registered institutions. To achieve 
this outcome, the Bank is building on its experience with the Results-Based 
disbursement approach, used in Jamaica as the first pilot in the Caribbean.  With the 
early childhood development project, it is expected that the number of early 
childhood institutions that are registered and meet the minimum standards would be 
increased. Overall, Bank Group support is being closely coordinated with the other 
IDPs, particularly the CDB, IDB, OAS, UNICEF and USAID. 
 Enhanced health and education services through the conditional cash transfer 
(CCT) mechanism.  The Bank will contribute to achieve this outcome through its 
continued support to PATH, Jamaica’s CCT mechanism, and building on its previous 
successes (about 80 percent of benefits reached the poorest 40 percent of the 
population; a 38 percent increase in health care visits for children younger than 6 
years for CCT beneficiaries; and, it has effectively encouraged households to send 
their children to school more regularly, resulting in CCT students’ school attendance 
rate being three percent higher than that of similar students not in the program).  
 Other instruments used to contribute to achieve the above outcomes are the ongoing 
HIV/AIDS project and the planned Skills for Inclusive Growth Project (FY12), which 
will contribute to address the shortage of skills and education of the workforce.   
In addition, a number of analytical underpinnings will be completed: The Education 
PER (FY10) is being financed by the UNDP, with in-kind support from the Bank.  
The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, FY10), which will examine the various 
labor market anomalies discussed earlier and will inform projects in human 
development and crime and violence prevention.  The PER (FY11), Regional Nurse 
Migration II (FY10) and Poverty Assessment (FY12) will also inform projects on 
human development as well as in other areas in support of promoting inclusive and 
sustained growth.

Results Area 3: Crime and Violence Prevention 
87. 
The CPS seeks to contribute to reduced crime and violence in the twelve inner 
cities basic services project beneficiary communities. In seeking to achieving a reduction 
in crime and violence in Jamaica, the Bank is adopting a new approach, which is a 
departure from numerous crime prevention programs common in Jamaica and in developing 
countries where single-discipline approaches (e.g., mentoring, dispute mitigation, youth at 
risk programs) are implemented without evidence-based rationale, and only in the best 
cases subject to rigorous process monitoring and ex-post evaluation.  The Bank will be 
linking the monitoring of crime patterns to programming, which will be facilitated by the 
development of a cutting-edge crime and violence information platform and early warning 
system for crime prevention planning and interventions across multiple disciplines.  
Through its support, the Bank seeks to improve the quality of life in the targeted areas 
and poor urban informal settlements through improved access to basic urban 
infrastructure, financial services, land tenure regularization, enhanced community 
capacity, and improvements in public safety. Towards achieving the above outcome, the 
Bank is implementing the Inner Cities Basic Services Project and the recently approved 
Crime and Violence JSDF grant.  A comprehensive and integrated Crime and Violence 
Project (FY12) will be informed by a Country Social Assessment (FY11) and lessons 
from the existing projects. 
Results Area 4: Promoting Rural Development 
88. 
The CPS seeks to contribute to improved market penetration by small scale 
producers and tourism service providers. The Bank aims to achieve this outcome 
through its support to community and business groups in medium-sized farming and eco-
tourism to move up the supply chain. IFC efforts in support of the tourism sector will 
develop linkages with the local enterprises (e.g., agribusiness), notably via advisory 
services and managerial skills building. 
Pillar III: Promoting Sustained Growth, Results Area 5: Strengthening non-labor 
competitiveness  
89. 
The CPS seeks to contribute to the following outcomes: medium-sized farmers 
moved up the supply chain and small scale agricultural producers received capacity 
training. The ongoing rural development initiative will support medium-sized farmers to 
move up the supply chain and also work with small scale agricultural producers and 
tourism product providers on capacity training so that they are better integrated with the 
tourism sector, rest of the economy, and the export markets.  
90. 
In addition, the Bank and the IFC will collaborate closely to optimize synergies in 
supporting the reduction in distortions and the enhancement of the efficiency of the tax 
system. The focus will be on public-private partnership, energy diversification, 
conservation, efficiency and institutional training for policy analysis and regulation. 
Achieving results in energy efficiency and diversification will depend on: (i) reducing the 
electricity utility’s energy losses to yield significant benefits for Jamaica’s energy 
security and efficiency, and (ii) strengthening the process for setting tariffs to avoid 
passing utility costs to consumers, as is currently practiced, to lower energy prices and 
bolster Jamaica’s competitiveness. The proposed energy program may be supplemented 
with GEF grants.  

25 

 
 
91. 
The Bank and IFC will also explore including Jamaica in the Caribbean Advanced 
Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (CARCIP) using grant resources.  This 
program will follow a public-private partnership model to promote the deployment of the 
required submarine regional communications infrastructure, while at the same time 
ensuring that: (i) it is complemented with terrestrial broadband links; and (ii) the content 
and applications are developed to increase value-added use of the infrastructure. The 
program will be rolled out to the CARIFORUM countries in phases, depending on their 
readiness and interest in joining the program.   
92. 
In investment climate, the Doing Business Reform Unit of the Bank and IFC, 
included Jamaica in the Caribbean Business Enabling Environment analytical work and 
separately submitted a reform memorandum around the areas covered by the Doing 
Business indicators. Group support in these areas will be in close collaboration with 
CDB, DFID, IDB, UNDP and USAID.  Jointly with the Bank, IFC action will include 
developing a better business environment for special economic zones, investment and 
trade promotion. In addition, to contribute to support the government in addressing the 
energy challenges, the Bank and the IFC will collaborate to optimize synergies through a 
new Energy Project (FY11). The project will focus on public-private partnership, energy 
diversification, conservation, efficiency and institutional training for policy analysis and 
regulation, and will be informed by the two ongoing regional studies: the “Energy Study” 
and the “Impact of the Financial Crisis on the Energy.” 
93. 
Financial markets development and access to finance – IFC will cover several 
areas 
including supporting entrepreneurs via better access 
to finance 
through 
M/SME/trade finance, and advisory services to help banks reach MSMEs market 
segments. Concerning capital markets development, IFC will focus on a more regional 
approach, a likely area will be the insurance market. IFC is working with the Bank in 
Jamaica on credit bureau legislation, part of a Caribbean-wide initiative, which has been 
presented to the Parliament for discussion, and aims at achieving sharing of credit 
information between specified bodies and licensing of credit bureaus. Work done by the 
Bank under fiscal and debt sustainability could eventually result in creating greater 
financial market investment opportunities, which IFC could support. 
94. 
Infrastructure – IFC’s main areas will include energy, transport (air and road) 
and logistics (supporting SEZ).  Work done in energy, and to a lesser extent transport and 
logistics, will be mainly driven by two cross cutting themes:  climate change challenges, 
and reaching the poor. IFC will be involved in supporting PPP both via its advisory 
services and investments. The recently signed cooperation agreement with CIDA offers 
an opportunity for expanded advisory services support by IFC to the English Speaking 
Caribbean, including Jamaica. In energy, both the Bank and IFC will be advising the 
government on potential investment in natural gas. IFC’s other activities may include 
investments in growth sectors such as tourism and manufacturing. 
Results Area 6: Climate Resilience and Vulnerability Reduction 
95. 
The CPS seeks to contribute to achieve the following outcomes: 
 Climate resilience and vulnerability reduction measures strengthened, particularly 
through reduced landslide risks in an initiative in four communities. Jamaican and 
Bank systems for safeguards management will be harmonized while integrating the 

26 

 
 
lessons learned from the JSIF Use of Country Systems pilot, and scaling-up this 
initiative to other agencies. A regional GDDRR project is also supporting with 
climate change issues. In addition, Jamaica will benefit from the Pilot Program for 
Climate Resilience (PPCR)21 in 2010, under which  country-led activities will 
include: (i) pilot and demonstrate approaches for integration of climate risk and 
resilience into development policies and planning; (ii) strengthen capacities at the 
national levels to integrate climate resilience into development planning; (iii) scale-up 
and leverage climate resilient investment, building upon other ongoing initiatives; and 
(iv) enable learning-by-doing and sharing of lessons at various levels. The ongoing 
JSDF grant for landslide risk reduction will strengthen the capacity of the national 
disaster management agency on risk reduction and reduce landslide risks in four 
vulnerable communities across the country. IFC will address climate change issues 
such as raising benchmark in environmental standards and a cleaner energy mix. 
 Agriculture weather risk coverage introduced. The Bank will focus on the public 
investment needed to design and implement public and private financial risk 
management mechanisms and instruments, through the Agriculture Risk Management 
Support (FY13) with potential complementary operation from IDB’s MIF to support 
the private sector insurance sector. An agricultural review will examine prospects for 
using agriculture to anchor development, identify cropping patterns to minimize 
windstorm damage, and examine the extent and challenges of praedial larceny. 
Cross-Cutting Outcome, Result Area 7: Strengthen Governance 
96. 
The CPS seeks to contribute to achieving more efficient financial management 
and allocation of budget expenditures to achieve results. Through the DPLs, the Bank 
will support the government to improve its PEFA indicators related to fiscal planning, 
expenditure policy and budgeting, and to the scope, nature, and follow-up of external 
audits.  In addition, the Bank will support the government to implement its Auditor-
General’s operational plan and develop internal audit plans within the ministries to 
enhance availability and timeliness of information for public financial management, and 
better accountability in the use of public resources. The Bank will collaborate closely 
with the IDB and the EU which are also active in this area.  
97. MIGA will continue to provide political risk coverage for commercial lending to 
Jamaica, consistent with this Partnership Strategy. 

V. 

RESULTS-BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

98. 
Country-level systems for poverty, economic, and human development 
monitoring are being strengthened through government efforts and IDPs’ support.  The 
government has established a national M&E coordinating unit within the PIOJ, and is 

21 The PPCR is one of the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs), which are  interim funds developed by 
Multilateral Development Banks, participating countries and other stakeholders to bridge the financing gap 
prior to agreement on the next climate change regime. The PPCR was designed to enhance collaboration 
between MDBs and across Development Partners in assisting countries to address climate change 
adaptation. Therefore, the Jamaica PPCR would be jointly implemented, with the IDB. 

27 

 
 
                                                 
 
establishing Ministerial Focal Points that would monitor the MTF implementation and its 
related social outcomes. Building M&E capacity within the Ministries. The Bank recently 
approved a statistics trust fund to support the national statistics strategy and will work 
with the government to monitor CPS outcomes particularly in education, where capacity 
building efforts are ongoing in the context of the Bank’s support for the Education 
Transformation Program. The Bank is also soliciting bilateral support to deepen M&E 
efforts in Jamaica. The CPS will be monitored quarterly internally and once a year with 
the client along the line of a Results-Based Portfolio Review initiated in 2008.  

VI. MANAGING RISKS 

99. 
External and internal risks could impact significantly Bank Group support.  
The most important risk in the current global crisis is economic.  The global financial 
crisis and resulting economic downturn has reduced demand for Jamaica’s key exports – 
tourism, bauxite/alumina, and light manufacture – and reduced remittances from North 
America and Europe.  The crisis has also increased the government’s cost of servicing its 
variable rate and US dollar-denominated debt as well as the cost of rolling over existing 
debt.  These developments are projected to further reduce economic growth, increase 
unemployment, strain government finances, and pressure the currency. A comprehensive 
fiscal and debt sustainability package is under implementation  under an IMF Standby 
Agreement, which also provides for increased support for the poor and the vulnerable 
through the flagship conditional cash transfer program. 
100. While the current economic risks are substantial, there are several mitigating 
factors including ongoing macro-monitoring and country dialogue by the World Bank.  
Declining oil and food prices in 2008 reduced external financing requirements. Declining 
inflation also helped limit the negative impact of slower growth on the poor. In addition, 
a recent DPL supported actions to improve fiscal balances and address the debt 
generating process, and, thus, reduce financing vulnerabilities.  Funding from the CDB, 
IDB, and the World Bank mitigated a sizable portion of the external roll-over risk in 
FY09/10.  In FY10/11, the roll-over risk is for domestic debt. The government has also 
negotiated an IMF program. A concerted effort by the CDB, IDB and World Bank over 
the medium-term will also mitigate economic risks. 
101. Natural disasters are a continual risk.  Jamaica is highly vulnerable to multiple 
natural disaster risks—particularly floods and hurricanes.  The fiscal cost from past 
events has been high and natural disasters have the potential to derail economic growth 
and poverty reduction. They also pose a heavy fiscal burden, increasing indebtedness and 
redirecting public resources away from long-run development plans. The government has 
insurance against catastrophic natural disasters, is exploring the expansion of the scope 
of insurance. Major private sector enterprises would be partly covered by their own 
insurance.  The Jamaican government participates in The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk 
Insurance Facility (CCRIF), which helps to offset financing costs in the case of a 
significant, 1-in-15 year disaster.  The Bank is also assisting Jamaica through: (i) 
investments in natural disaster risk mitigation; (ii) development of a risk atlas; (iii) a 
community-based risk reduction pilot; and (iv) exploration of weather-related risk 
insurance for agriculture.

102. The political risk remains significant.  The government was elected in 2007 
with a two seats majority. Three of its sitting members of Parliament were challenged on 
dual citizenship and eligibility issue and a fourth one added later. Rather than dealing 
with the issue head-on and risk a re-election, the cases were heard in the courts. The 
foreign citizenships were given up and by-elections won with increased majority. The 
opposition did not participate in the third court-mandated by-election. Under the 
circumstances, the government’s program remains vulnerable to special interests. While 
the growth slowdown and pressing financial needs may exacerbate political concerns, it 
is just as likely that they may also spur consensus on the need for short-term actions.  The 
political risk is reduced by the government’s consultative approach to reform 
implementation and the dialogue among country stakeholders on the fiscal and economic 
costs of inaction. The government has been meeting with its social partners and has 
discussed with the Opposition Party the limited options it has in the current environment. 
There does not appear to be any short-term risk of a social unrest as demonstrated by the 
recent opposition-led demonstration against increased tax measures on food. 
103. Fiduciary risk is high.  Financial management and procurement take on special 
importance because of governance and corruption issues.  The Bank mitigates this risk by 
having the same fiduciary staff cover all Bank projects in the country; undertake 
“sweeping” missions to cover all projects; and, since 2009, arranges regular training 
and networking for implementing agencies during the “sweeping” missions. 
104. Governance and crime issues could give rise to reputational risks.  It is 
generally believed that many persons benefit from public sub-contracts in inner-city 
infrastructure rehabilitation projects, often in return for providing enforcement services to 
politicians.  The Bank will mitigate against this risk by careful ring fencing of projects 
under supervision, including regular supervision and examination of procurement 
transactions.  
105. Weakness 
in 
institutional capacity 
in 
the country could hamper 
implementation of the Partnership Strategy.  This risk becomes more important as the 
Bank broadens its areas of support and into the growth agenda.  Years of fiscal constraint 
has meant that many of the ministries and agencies have staff but not resources to provide 
services or that the staff do not have the right skills and motivation. This situation had 
been compounded by a new government with limited previous managerial experience; 
the new government has to learn the skills on the job.  In this environment, the Bank will 
enhance dialogue and continue its existing practice of supporting a project management 
team, funded by the investment project, with adequate number of staff and provision for 
training to ensure efficient and effective project implementation and monitoring. 
106. Following the extraordinary level of budgetary support to Jamaica proposed 
in this CPS, thereis a risk that the Bank would not be in a position to provide 
similar support in the future if Jamaica were to face acute and large financing needs 
either because of lack of sufficient follow through in implementing critical reforms 
or because of external shocks. These risks will be mitigated to some extent through 
continued policy dialogue, accompanied by technical assistance as needed, and a number 
of activities to mitigate and manage natural disasters, such as the CCRIF and landslide 
risk reduction efforts.

1. 
Jamaica has a high burden of public sector debt (139.7 percent of GDP estimated at 
the end of FY09/10) that is about J$554,143 or US$6,212 per person. Total public debt 
including domestic and external debt steadily increased from 84 percent of GDP in 1997 to a peak 
of 134.1 percent of GDP in FY99/00 following the financial crisis of the mid-1990s. Since 2003, 
gross public debt to GDP decreased to 113.5 percent in FY07/08, mostly due to high primary 
surpluses and decreasing interest rates and is estimated to be 139.7 percent at the end of FY09/10. 
In terms of its composition, domestic public debt as a share of total public debt increased from 10 
percent in 1991 to 55.3 percent by end FY09/10, while the share of external debt fell from 90 
percent to 44.7 percent over the same period (see Figure 1).

2. 
After the initial rise in FY09/10, and FY10/11, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to 
decrease in the medium-term to 115.6 percent in FY13/14.  The increase in debt ratios during 
FY08/09 and FY09/10 are expected to be temporary reflecting the worsening global environment 
and declining domestic economic activity. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline after the 
next fiscal year. In particular, government debt excluding guarantees is projected to decline 
substantially, reflecting the tight fiscal stance at the central government level. Regarding the 
increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio in FY08/10, main contributing factors are:  (i) a large increase 
in the amount of external debt in local currency terms due to a 23 percent exchange rate 
depreciation in FY08/09; and (ii) decline in primary budget surplus by 3.0 percent in FY08/09 
(only partially covered by the following increase in FY09/10) due to the impact of the global 
economic crisis and the underperformance of fiscal revenues. This unfavorable performance 
resulted primarily from fiscal revenues undershooting the budget targets by 9.8 percent. Budget 
expenditures were only 0.7 percent higher than the budget target in FY08/09. 
3. 
The composition of Jamaica’s gross public debt indicates significant exposure to 
currency, interest and roll-over risks. Roughly 50 percent of the total public debt including 
government guaranteed debt and PetroCaribe debt is indexed or denominated in foreign 
exchange. This indicates a high exposure of Jamaican debt to fluctuations in foreign exchange 
rate. The exposure of public debt to changes in interest rates is also significant, as variable-rate 
instruments account for about 55 percent of the domestic and 18 percent of the external debt. By 
increasing the amount of variable-rate instruments, the country has been able to extend the 
maturity of domestic public debt, but it has increased the exposure of public debt to interest rate 
movements.  With a share above 60 percent, Jamaica has markedly relied on credit from the 
private sector in its external borrowing.  Only 36.7 percent is from multilateral or bilateral 

45 

 
 
                    
 
creditors. A large portion of the domestic debt has a maturity of five year or below while 79.6 
percent of the external debt has a maturity longer than 5 year.

*Note: Total public debt in this table includes central government total debt, government-
guaranteed debt and Petrocaribe debt.  It excludes non-guaranteed Public Bodies debt. 

4. 
Stronger control of public bodies is critical for reducing the net public debt. The 
primary surplus, seignorage, and real GDP growth have had a significant impact lowering debt-
to-GDP between FY03/04 to FY06/07. Central government primary surplus peaked at 14.3 
percent of GDP in FY03/04 and remained at nearly the same level in FY04/05. Despite this high 
primary surplus, debt levels hardly fell as other debt accumulating flows contributed substantially 
to debt23. Other debt accumulating flows are primarily attributable to the assumption of liabilities 
from public bodies. This contributed to debt growth considerably in the past seven years (14.2 
percentage points of GDP in 2007/08), highlighting the importance of reforms to increase control 
over the Public bodies’ debt generating process.  
5. 

The rest of this annex a summary of a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) 
conducted using Monte Carlo simulations. A baseline scenario is constructed using the 
latest projections for the Jamaican economy. Several alternative scenarios are constructed 
to analyze the impact of different shocks on the path of debt to GDP ratio and to 

23. Public Bodies’ fiscal accounts are not consolidated with the Central Government’s accounts, which is 
why debt assumed by the Central Government is referred to as other debt accumulating flows.

6. 

The baseline scenario assumes fiscal consolidation. In the baseline, Jamaica is 
expected to post a 6.2 percent primary surplus in FY09/10 and to further consolidate the 
fiscal position in the following four years (8.0 percent primary surplus on average). The 
key variables are then kept constant, with primary surplus of 9.1 percent of GDP through 
FY19/2020. In the baseline, the debt to GDP ratio is estimated to be 139.7 percent of 
GDP in FY09/2010 and peak the following year at 140.2 percent of GDP before 
decreasing and eventually reaching 115.5 percent of GDP by FY13/14 and 65.4 percent 
of GDP by FY19/20 The evolution of the debt to GDP ratio is driven by the assumptions 
embedded in the baseline scenario. First, a large fiscal consolidation that generates an 
improvement in the primary balance starting with the base year (FY09/10). Second, GDP 
growth is projected to be higher than its average of 1.5 percent between 2003 and 2008. 
Third, the real interest rate remains below its level in FY09/10 throughout the period. 

7. 
The results of the alternative scenarios, which are generated by adjusting selected 
variables, are presented in the table below. The analysis indicates that, given the global 

external environment and even with the successful implementation of the government 
reform plans, net debt to GDP is unlikely to fall below 100 percent of GDP by FY11/12 
as originally anticipated by the government. Even under the most favorable scenario, total 
debt is not expected to fall below 110 percent of GDP in FY13/14. At the same time, 
however, under the most extreme scenario of no reform, debt is expected to increase from 
140 percent to 143 percent of GDP over the same period.

1. The new programmatic DPL series envisaged under this CPS is to support the 
government’s medium term reform program, which includes as a core component policy 
actions aimed at fiscal sustainability.  
2. The government’s fiscal sustainability reform program is part of its medium-
term socio-economic policy framework.  The framework sets out the broad package of 
policies, strategies and programs proposed by the Government for implementation over 
the period 2009-2012, and is focused on fiscal and debt sustainability, establishment of 
an efficient and equitable tax system, financial system stability and price stability. It 
supports the overall vision, goals and outcomes of Jamaica’s long term development plan, 
Vision 2030, and is the vehicle that transforms these long term goals and outcomes into 
medium-run priorities, strategies, programs and measures. The new Fiscal Responsibility 
Framework (FRF) is at the core of the Government’s reform program and will be 
submitted to Parliament and implemented over the course of the next two years. It 
specifies responsibilities, processes, and targets for achieving the Government’s objective 
of reducing public debt to below 100 percent of GDP by 2015/16. 
3. The FRF is designed to strengthen the budget process by enhancing the mechanisms 
for transparency and establishing clearer goals, targets, and limits for public spending, 
deficits, and debt. The government authorized the Ministry of Finance and the Public 
Service in November 2008 to initiate a consultative process with stakeholders and legal 
experts in order to prepare a draft FRF for Cabinet submission and then for submission to 
Parliament. The FRF would introduce the principles of responsible fiscal management 
through amendments to the Financial Accountability Act (FAA) and the Public Bodies 
Management Act (PBMA) and also improve fiscal transparency through detailed 
reporting requirements and greater parliamentary oversight over the expenditures of all 
public bodies. In addition, the government has reviewed and proposed amendments to all 
financial legislation to make it more manageable and to combine the various pieces into a 
comprehensive public financial management act. 
4. The FRF specifies that the Minister of Finance will be responsible for the 
development and implementation of a fiscal policy framework, supervision and 
monitoring of public financing, and coordination of international and intergovernmental 
fiscal relations. Each year the Ministry of Finance will table in Parliament a fiscal policy 
paper, including the Fiscal Responsibility Statement (FRS) and the Fiscal Management 
Strategy (FMS). The FRS specifies an acceptable overall fiscal balance and level of total 
public debt and sets out the fiscal policy measures necessary to achieve these targets. The 
FMS assesses current and projected financing needs and presents a three year plan for the 
development of the economy, including the level of public expenditure as percentage of 
GDP. In addition, the FMS will establish targets over a set of fiscal indicators, e.g., 
annual public borrowing, the overall balance, and the primary balance. The MOF will 
also provide an explanation to Parliament in the event of any deviation from these targets 
and the Minister will have to inform Parliament of any changes in policy.

5. The objective of the FRF is to achieve explicit targets for public debt, public sector 
wage bill, and the overall fiscal balance. A central feature of the FRF is the emphasis on 
greater transparency in the preparation of annual estimates of revenue and expenditure 
and any changes in policies or practices. The Auditor General will review the fiscal 
policy paper to ensure that it complies with the principles of prudent fiscal management. 
These principles are specified in the FRF as prudent management of contingent liabilities, 
maintenance of debt at sustainable level, gearing of borrowing towards productive 
purposes, and management of expenditures at levels consistent with revenues.  
6. Public bodies’ rationalization is being facilitated by the new Public Sector 
Transformation Unit in the Cabinet office. A strategic action plan has been submitted 
to Cabinet with a view to facilitating the establishment of an efficient, responsive and 
cost effective framework of operations for the Public Sector, consistent with good 
governance, and in line with the government’s development objectives. This action plan 
was developed by the Public Sector Transformation Unit (PSTU), launched by the Prime 
Minister and has been fully operational since November 2009. The PSTU’s 
recommendations are to be implemented through transition teams in each Ministry. The 
scope of work of the PSTU includes: (i) prior reviews of all Ministries, Departments and 
Agencies, including Public Bodies, to determine what functions should be retained, 
privatized, contracted out, abolished or be merged with other sector entities; (ii) the 
development of a master rationalization plan with milestones and cost estimates; (iii) the 
implementation of a Government Wide Network (GovNet) including establishment of 
integrated IT systems; and (iv) the implementation a Strategic Human Resource 
Management Structure/System. The government expects the PSTU to complete its work 
during a period of 18 months (by May 2011).  Implementation of reforms by transition 
teams are expected to take place during and after this period. The PSTU is working with 
a Consultative Monitoring Group, fully functional since December 2009, including 
representatives from the private sector, universities and trade unions, to ensure extensive 
consultations and engagement in social dialogue with stakeholders at all levels. 
7. The FRF also includes measures aimed at improving the governance of public 
entities. Critical amendments to the PBMA have been submitted for Parliamentary 
approval as part of the FRF. The key features of these amendments include: (a) 
prohibiting Public Bodies from entering into negotiations to issue debt without prior 
approval by the Minister of Finance; (b) requiring Public Bodies to submit corporate 
plans and any modifications to the Minister of Finance for endorsement and the 
Parliament for approval; (c) requiring the Minister of Finance to prepare an annual report 
to Parliament of estimates of revenue and expenditure for all Public Bodies; and (d) 
requiring Public Bodies to submit information on their financial operations to the 
Financial Secretary. These amendments also include regulations to strengthen the 
Financial Distribution Policy, Acquisition of Shares, Code of Conduct for Directors, and 
Code of Audit Practices. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance is providing training in 
corporate governance to the leadership of Public Bodies.  
8. In an unprecedented departure, the FRF includes a provision for submission of public 
bodies’ accounts to Parliament for approval; this will directly support the PSTU’s 
strategy to improve public sector governance. The annual Budget Memorandum in 
FY2010/11 will include a discussion of the movements of the consolidated public sector 

50 

 
 
Annex 4  
Page 3 of 3 

with a summary table showing at least the main aggregates for the consolidated public 
sector. The inevitable data gaps and discrepancies would be acknowledged and addressed 
over time, but such consolidated budgeting and reporting should help to support the 
measures proposed under the FRF. Clear targets would also be set for expanding the 
coverage and quality of reporting in the annual Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure 
report for public entities. The government is aiming to increase the coverage of entities 
complying with “Statement A” reporting. Milestones in producing consolidated fiscal 
accounts (consistent with international Government Financial Statistics standards) will 
also be established.  The winding-up of inactive public bodies would be completed within 
a reasonable timeframe (e.g. end-2010). The costs and benefits of the program should be 
evaluated, including any fiscal savings, and published on the Ministry’s webpage.  
9. Progress has been achieved in improving Tax Administration and further 
improvements are being sought. The government has been implementing a major Tax 
Administration reform to increase the tax base, enforce compliance, increase efficiency 
and effectiveness of the Tax Administration and Customs Department, and thereby boost 
government revenues. In FY09/10, the government's tax reform efforts focus on: 
improving compliance, improving information and communication technology, and 
improving enforcement. The authorities have received support from the World Bank, US 
Treasury, IRS, CARTAC and USAID. 
10. In the context of tax administration reform, a number of important steps have been 
undertaken: i) a large taxpayer office was established on April 15, 2009 with two offices 
in Kingston and Montego Bay. As of end-December 2009, the 205 largest taxpayers were 
covered and the authorities are aiming at taking 200 more companies into the scope of the 
Office by end FY2009/10; ii) a Customer Care center was established on April 1, 2009 
with the objective of improving customer service, standardizing the response to tax 
related inquiries by tax payers, and keeping tax payers current with their taxes. The 
Center covers the entire country and all types of taxes; iii) a Forensic Data Mining Unit 
was established in June 2009. The Unit is increasing tax compliance and enforcement by 
making use of forensic techniques to gather information about the tax obligations of tax 
payers and check this against the actual filing of taxes so as to prevent tax evasion; iv) a 
High Intensity Team was established in June 2009. The team is comprised of auditors and 
collectors and put forward a combined effort to improve collections. The Team will act as 
a field extension of the Forensic Data Mining Unit; v) a Special Enforcement Team was 
established in July 2009. The Team is comprised of 6 people and focuses on enforcing 
compliance after other efforts have failed. 
11. The Government’s reform agenda is part of a well-specified, medium-term program 
designed to support macroeconomic stability and the achievement of fiscal and debt 
sustainability to further longer-run development objectives. The reform program is 
ambitious and substantive, and is expected to be completed over a period of two years 
due to the perception within the country that the need for fiscal and debt management 
reform is urgent. Therefore, the Bank’s support to the Government’s program is proposed 
as a series of two programmatic development policy operations. The policy actions and 
outcome indicators supported by the proposed programmatic DPL series are sequenced to 
match the government’s phased approach to reforms, which is necessary in the context of 
the specific conditions and procedures that prevail in Jamaica.

INTRODUCTION 

1. This completion report reviews the implementation of the Country Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) covering Bank assistance to Jamaica during FY06-09. The CAS was 
approved by the Board in April 2005 and a progress report on its implementation was 
presented to the Board on July 19, 2007. The report assesses the alignment of the Bank 
strategy with Jamaica’s long-term strategic goals, the extent to which intended outcomes 
are being achieved, and the Bank performance in contributing to those achievements. 
Drawing from the experience in implementing this CAS, the report concludes with 
lessons for designing future Bank assistance to Jamaica. 

2. In addition to discussions with the country team, the assessment is based on reviews 
of relevant program documents such as the CAS, the CAS Progress Report, Project 
Appraisal Documents, Project Implementation Status and Results Reports, Reports on 
Analytical and Advisory Activities, Implementation Completion Reports and IEG/QAG 
evaluations and assessments. A one week country visit to Jamaica provided the 
opportunity to solicit feedback from key government counterparts, other development 
partners in Jamaica, selected stakeholders from the Jamaican civil society as well as some 
of the potential beneficiaries under the Bank-supported projects. Lists of the key Bank 
and non-Bank individuals consulted in preparing this completion report as well as the 
project sites visited during the country visit are shown in Annex 5A. 

II. 

JAMAICA’S LONGER-TERM STRATEGIC GOALS 

3. The 2005 CAS was guided by Jamaica’s Medium-Term Socioeconomic Policy 
Framework (MTF) for 2004-07. The Framework noted the numerous economic reforms 
Jamaica had undertaken since the early 1980s to reduce poverty by increasing the role of 
market forces in allocating resources, fostering private sector activity, overhauling the 
trade policy and trade regime, restructuring of the financial sector, enhancing human 
capital, and improving social protection.  While lauding Jamaica’s relatively good social 
indicators, the Framework lamented, however, the disappointing performance overall 
with low economic growth, large public debt, weak export performance, low 
productivity, weak institutions, poor educational performance, environmental degradation 
and, above all, an exceptionally high incidence of violent crime. 

4. Going forward the MTF outlined the following key macro- and social policy 
objectives for the medium-term: 
 Maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework (keeping inflation in single digit 
range, accelerating GDP growth to above 3%, eliminating budget deficit by 2005/06, 

52 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       Annex 5  
   Page 2 of 15 

 

maintaining competitive exchange rate, and reducing debt to GDP ratio to less than 
100%); 
 Eradication of poverty and increased social inclusion for the poor (reducing 
vulnerability of the poor, increased access to housing and sanitation, and use of 
participatory approaches in developing policies and programs); 
Improved education and health status for the population (improved access and quality 
for both primary and secondary education, prevention and control of morbidity and 
mortality, prevention and treatment HIV/AIDS); 
 Creation of a safe and secure Jamaica (reduction in violent crimes,  reform of  the 
Justice sector to provide improved access to justice); 
Improved governance (enhanced public sector efficiency, increased openness in 
public management); and 
 Environmental sustainability 
resources). 

(sustainable management of Jamaica’s natural 

 

5. Judged against the expectations articulated in the MTF, Jamaica’s progress towards 
the above goals over the CAS period (FY06-09) must be considered mixed at best. While 
some modest gains were made in reducing poverty and in better-targeting of Jamaica’s 
social programs, there was virtually no progress towards achieving macroeconomic 
stability. The governance indicators also deteriorated; as per Transparency International 
rankings, Jamaica slipped from 57 in 2003 to 84 (out of 132 countries) in 2007. Jamaica 
scored particularly poorly on public security – in turn, a reflection of persistently high 
violent 
crime 
rate. 
Environmental 
sustainability 
also suffered with forests and 
watersheds 
increasingly 
degraded, and beaches, coral 
reefs and harbors threatened by 
pollution24.

(Table 1). After some hopeful

the GDP growth over the four

1.1%, far below the 3.3% target 
under 
the MTF 
and 
indistinguishable from the longer-term trend (annual GDP growth of 1% since 1991). 
Achieving price stability also proved to be an elusive goal with annual inflation 
averaging over 14% compared to the less than 6% foreseen under the MTF. Central 
Government’s primary surplus was also no where close to the targeted 14% and as a 
result little progress was made in bringing the national debt to a more manageable level.

       Page 3 of 15 

7.  Reinforcing the worrisome macro-economic performance is the perception of 
broader weakening of the rule of law, exemplified by Jamaica’s high murder rate – over 
1,600 people (or 64 per 100,000 population) were murdered in 2008, making Jamaica one 
of the most violent places in the world.  

8. The main bright spots in this generally dismal picture are the continuing reduction in 
absolute poverty with the country well-positioned to reach most of the MDGs25 (Annex 
5B). However, sustainability of these gains on the social front also remains a question 
mark given the fragile macro-economic situation as well as the likely fall out from the 
current global financial crisis. 

9. Although in part the disappointing performance over the past few years is due to 
external shocks (2007 Hurricane Dean, sharp increase in food and fuel prices during 
2006/07, and the recent global financial turmoil), it also reflects design weaknesses in the 
MTF itself. Specifically, the MTF 
 was more a statement of good intentions rather than a coherent program of priority 
actions consistent with the country’s financial and institutional capacities; would have 
benefited from a critical analysis of the reasons behind Jamaica’s lagging macro-
economic performance over the previous two decades and the lessons from the failed 
reform efforts of the past; 
 suffered from inadequate attention to sources of growth and to the role of primary 
sectors such as agriculture; 
 did not focus adequately on the efficiency and sustainability of public expenditures in 
social sectors (e.g., financing of tertiary education, attention to broader health sector 
issues beyond HIV/AIDS); 
 did not address adequately the issues of corruption and the rapid growth of the 
underground economy; and 
 did not take into account adequately the natural disasters that impact Jamaica on a 
regular basis. 

10. Thus, while the goals and aspirations articulated in the MTF were unexceptionable, 
and still remain valid, the Framework provided little guidance on how they were to be 
achieved, especially considering the financial, institutional, environmental, and socio-
political constraints facing Jamaica. 

III. CAS OUTCOMES 

11. 
The World Bank Group Strategy for 2006-09 was designed around three mutually 
reinforcing pillars (accelerating inclusive economic growth; improving human 
development and opportunity; and crime prevention and reduction) and two cross-
cutting themes (governance and environmental sustainability). The strategy was based 
on a close collaboration with the government and was consistent with the goals outlined 
in the MTF. Not surprisingly, the CAS suffered from some of the same weaknesses as the 

25 Two notable exceptions being performance vis-à-vis child mortality and maternal mortality goals. 

54

Page 4 of 15 

MTF. Despite that, the Bank was able to make a positive contribution to Jamaica’s 
longer-term goals although not as much as it could have had its strategy been 
underpinned by a more critical assessment of the realism and implementability of the 
MTF. In particular, many of the risks noted in the CAS (natural disasters, external 
economic shocks, policy slippage/slow implementation and limited fiscal space) did 
materialize and should have gotten more attention in designing of the CAS program. 
12. 
Since the Jamaica CAS design did not incorporate a results framework with 
monitorable CAS outcomes, this evaluation has to be based on intended outcomes and 
results chains inferred from discussions in the CAS text and from elaborations in the CAS 
Progress Report. A retrofitted results summary matrix building on the work done under 
the CAS Progress Report is shown in Annex 5B. The CAS implementation also suffered 
from a lack of systematic monitoring and reporting of intended outcomes, leading to 
weak empirical underpinning for the CAS evaluation. Unavoidably, therefore, this 
evaluation includes an added layer of subjective judgments, over and above what is 
normal for such evaluations. Also, in the absence of data on specific CAS outcomes, 
country outcomes that this CAS was intended to support take on added importance.  
13. 
As discussed below, the performance along each of the three CAS pillars as well 
as for the Environmental Sustainability theme is rated as moderately satisfactory. In 
contrast, the performance under the Governance theme is rated as moderately 
unsatisfactory. The performance for the CAS as a whole is rated as moderately 
satisfactory. The summary ratings reflects scope for improving upon the CAS program 
through better focus and greater realism in defining the CAS objectives coupled with 
generally satisfactory outcomes at the individual product level.   

Pillar I: Accelerating Inclusive Economic Growth (Moderately Satisfactory) 

14. 
Pillar I was intended to promote two main objectives: achievement of 
macroeconomic stability; and reduction of poverty and increased social inclusion for the 
poor. The Bank CAS was to contribute to the first objective by providing access to 
broader information base for informed policy making through analytical and advisory 
work. In parallel, the Bank’s lending program was to support the “inclusion” objective 
through streamlining and better targeting of the education and health services under the 
PATH26 program.  

15. 
Going by Jamaica’s macroeconomic trends over the past few years (Para. 6), the 
performance on the first objective was clearly unsatisfactory. Considering that the Bank’s 
contribution in this area was to be primarily through analytical work, surprisingly little 
effort was devoted to analytical work and economic monitoring during the CAS period; 
AAA expenditures during the CAS period amounted to less than 10% of the country 
services budget compared to 25-30% share in most other countries (Para. 43). The CAS 
should have also been more forthright in assessing the realism of MTF’s macroeconomic 
targets and in recognizing the limitations of the CAS approach in influencing actual 

26  Jamaica’s National Program for Advancement through Health and Education.

government policies and programs. More proactive follow-up and dissemination of the 
findings of the pre-CAS analytical work would have also been helpful.  
16. 
An encouraging development in this respect is the recent approval of a US$100 
million Development Policy Loan (DPL) to support fiscal and debt sustainability 
following more intensive engagement on macro-economic issues between the Bank and 
the newly elected government in Jamaica. The DPL is focused on: (i) aligning the budget 
to medium-term expenditure priorities; (ii) improving efficiency of public sector 
spending through public sector reform; and (iii) lowering public debt to reduce 
macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The DPL complements parallel support from IDB and the 
EU, the other two major development partners in Jamaica. It is a step in the right 
direction in addressing Jamaica’s chronic macro imbalances; however, it is coming too 
late in the current CAS cycle to affect outcomes for this CAS. Also, given the severity of 
Jamaica’s macroeconomic difficulties, the reform program will need sustained efforts and 
support over several years if it is to move Jamaica away from the economic stagnation of 
the past two decades. It is too early to tell whether the GOJ and its development partners 
will have the will and the staying power to sustain these efforts over the long term. Some 
of the stakeholders, especially IDB, wondered whether the single tranche design of the 
DPL implied less than total commitment by the World Bank to the reform program 
adopted by the GOJ. 
17. 
As to the second objective under this pillar, the CAS appears to have made a 
significant contribution to provide better and more cost-effective social assistance to the 
poor under the Social Safety Net Project.  Through support for the PATH program, the 
Project had as of September 2008, reached about 300,000 beneficiaries, almost half of 
whom were from the poorest quintile (and 80% from the two poorest quintiles). The 
project contributed to the consolidation of the major cash assistance programs into the 
PATH program and also supported desirable behavioral changes to encourage human 
capital development of the poor children.  
18. 
Also commendable was the Bank support channeled through the Jamaica Social 
Investment Fund (JSIF) for demand-driven, community infrastructure (especially for 
education, health and roads) under the National Community Development Program 
(NCDP). Performance indicators monitored as part of the NCDP completion report show 
significantly improved student performance and increased usage of health care facilities 
in communities served under that Project. The JSIF itself is a good example of successful 
institution building in Jamaica through sustained support by the Bank. These gains 
however need to be tempered by the fact that the related CAS milestones—adoption of 
legislation to mainstream PATH as a conditional cash transfer mechanism; and 
introduction of special bonuses for secondary school students to minimize drop-outs—are 
still pending suggesting need for further consensus building within Jamaica around those 
programs. 
19. 
The Bank assistance for macro-economic stabilization and inclusive growth was 
complemented by support from IFC and MIGA to the private sector for addressing the 
infrastructural constraints and supporting financial markets development. IFC’s activities 
in Jamaica were part of its broader effort to support growth and competitiveness in the 
English Speaking Caribbean. IFC mobilized two loans totaling US$46 million (including 
$20 million from syndicating banks) for development and expansion of the Montego Bay 

56

Page 6 of 15 

Airport, the main gateway for tourist arrivals to Jamaica. As a result of these investments, 
the Airport’s annual handling capacity has been boosted to 9 million passengers a year, 
eliminating capacity constraints for the foreseeable future. IFC also provided a $123 
million (of which $50 million through syndication) to Jamaica Energy Partners, an 
independent power producer to help finance the expansion of its power plant from 74.2 
MW to 123.6 MW. Finally, IFC provided US$68 million of assistance to support lending 
to Micro, Small and Medium sized enterprises as well as to promote insurance services 
and real estate development27. IFC is also advising then Government in designing and 
implementing the strategy for privatization of the national airline, Air Jamaica. MIGA’s 
contribution included two guarantees for a total of $79.2 million to help double the 
capacity of the Kingston Port Container Terminal to over 3 million 20-foot containers 
(equivalent units) per year.  

Pillar II: Improving Human Development and Opportunity (Moderately 
Satisfactory) 

20. 
Pillar II also supported two main objectives: Improved access to and quality of 
education; and HIV/AIDS prevention and care. Support under the first objective was to 
be focused on secondary education (through the ongoing ROSE II project) and on early 
childhood development (through preparation and implementation of a sector-wide 
strategy to bring congruence to the programs of several donors active in the sub-sector). 
The ROSE II project, nearing completion, appears to have positively influenced learning 
outcomes through improved teaching methodologies and through locally determined 
school improvement sub-projects in 99 targeted schools. The project also supported 
construction of two new secondary schools (creation of 800 additional places) in under-
served areas. To address the needs of children from poor households, the project included 
a scholarship program to support placement of 450 poor children in private schools. 
However, for reasons not fully understood, the scholarship program experienced 
significant drop-outs and the number of students successfully completing the three-year 
program is likely to miss the target.  
21. 
In early childhood development, a sector-wide strategy was prepared with 
financing by a PHRD grant from Japan and the strategy is now being financed by a $15 
million loan from the Bank. The project aims to: (i) improve the monitoring of children’s 
development, the screening of household level risks, and the risk mitigation and early 
intervention systems; (ii) enhance the quality of early childhood schools and care 
facilities; and (iii) strengthen Early Childhood organizations and institutions. After 
several delays, the project became effective on February 9, 2009 and project mobilization 
is under way; nonetheless, due to capacity constraints in the Early Childhood 
Commission, the main GOJ counterpart, successful project implementation will require 
continuing intensive support from the Bank. Feedback from other partners active in the 
sub-sector (especially, the UNICEF) during the CASCR mission also suggests the need 
for further efforts at building consensus around the project approach and strategy. In 
particular, questions remain about whether the ECD Commission should only have policy 

27 US$20 million to First Global Bank for on-lending to MSMEs, US$30 million to National Commercial 
Bank of Jamaica to support its diversification of funding sources and strengthen its balance sheet, and 
US$18 million to First Jamaica Investment Limited to support its real  estate development projects.

making and regulatory functions or whether it should also have direct implementation 
responsibilities as stipulated under the project. 
22. 
Both the ROSE II project and the ECD project appear well-targeted to the sectoral 
needs and priorities.  However, both would have benefited from greater realism during 
the design/appraisal stage. The Rose II project was clearly over dimensioned in relation 
to the fiscal space, necessitating painful restructuring and cancellations. The ECD project, 
on the other hand, appears to have underestimated the institutional constraints in 
launching a new initiative such as that—leading to delayed effectiveness and a slow take-
off. 
23. 
From the Education sector perspective, a key missed opportunity concerned 
engaging the government on the overall financing for the sector, especially the issue of 
financing and cost recovery for tertiary education. Considering the unusually high unit 
costs for the tertiary education28 and considering that the tertiary education mostly 
benefits the better-off segments of the population29, both efficiency and equity 
considerations would suggest revisiting of the current financing patterns, keeping in mind 
of course the political sensitivity of the issue. An Education Sector Transformation 
project is currently under preparation for approval in FY10 and is expected to address this 
gap. 
24. 
CAS support under the second objective of this pillar was aimed at assisting the 
government in curbing the spread of HIV through: (a) the expansion of preventive 
programs; (b) the strengthening of treatment, care and support for people living with 
HIV/AIDS; and (c) and strengthening of Jamaica’s multi-sectoral capacity to respond to 
the epidemic. The two Bank-supported HIV/AIDS projects appear to have played 
important catalytic role in leveraging resources from various donors in successfully 
addressing the issues. The projects have made significant contribution to the expansion of 
preventive services for the at-risk population; and for treatment, care and support for 
people infected and/or affected by HIV/AIDS. The projects helped in the development 
and adoption of the National HIV/AIDS policy, development of HIV policies in various 
sectors as well as preparation of the new National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (2007-12). 
The projects also helped foster an environment that reduces stigma and discrimination by 
sensitizing and mobilizing community leaders and opinion makers in support of the HIV 
programs. A particularly noteworthy achievement of the program is the reduction in 
mother to child transmission rate from 25% in 2002 to 5% in 2008. The main unfinished 
agenda in this regard concerns delay in amending the Public Health Act due to the slow 
legislative processes.  
25. 
As in case of the Education sector, the Bank missed an opportunity to be even 
more effective by not focusing adequately on the broader Health sector issues, including 
the deterioration in quality of health care, financial sustainability of the sectoral 
expenditures, and the lack of progress on MDGs related to infant mortality and maternal 
mortality.  Given the progress made on the HIV/AIDS issue, any future support in the

sector should take a more comprehensive perspective of the sectoral constraints and 
priorities including the shifting morbidity and mortality profiles towards the non-
communicable diseases.  

Pillar III: Crime Prevention and Reduction (Moderately Satisfactory) 

26. 
The key outcome under Pillar III was to develop an effective community crime 
prevention system. The CAS support to that end included both AAA and lending. The 
study on Caribbean Crime, Violence and Development, prepared jointly with the UN 
Office on Drugs and Crime, was a high quality product, well received all around. The 
study analyzed the implications of crime for growth, highlighting crime as a 
developmental issue, and promoting new methodologies to address crime prevention and 
reduction. Going by the numerous favorable references made to the study by various 
stakeholders during the CASCR mission, the Bank also did a good job of disseminating 
its findings and the study is playing an important role in shaping stakeholder views on the 
crime problem in Jamaica.  
27. 
The Inner City Basic Services Project is the other major intervention under this 
Pillar of the CAS. The project supports demand-driven infrastructural investments to help 
improve quality of life in 12 crime-prone inner city areas. Specifically, the project aims 
to: (a)increase access and improve the quality of water, sanitation, solid waste collection 
systems, electricity, roads, drainage and related community infrastructure for over 60,000 
residents of poor urban settlements; (b) facilitate access to microfinance for enterprise 
development and home improvements; (c) increase security of tenure for households in 
the project areas; and (d) enhance public safety through mediation services, community 
capacity building, skills training and related social services. It is an innovative project 
with potentially high rewards. However, the project design and appraisal were not as 
thorough as they could have been. Notwithstanding the large expenditures on project 
preparation (financed through a PHRD grant), the project suffered from poor quality 
technical designs suggesting inadequate oversight of the survey and design work. The 
implementation has also suffered delays due to difficulties in attracting qualified 
contractors to work on infrastructural sub-projects located in high crime areas. Also of 
concerns are the delays in the process for regularization of land tenure for the urban poor. 
With the first batch of project-funded facilities coming on stream in the near future, the 
project supervision also needs to give greater attention to the O&M aspects of the 
completed facilities. Given the multi-dimensional nature of the crime problem in 
Jamaica, and the need to show visible results to change the mindsets in the affected 
communities, it will be unreasonable to expect quick results. 

Cross-Cutting Theme I: Governance. (Moderately Unsatisfactory) 

28. 
Although good governance was considered “fundamental to the strategic 
objectives of the Government” and governance was a cross-cutting theme under the CAS, 
the CAS included little substantive analysis of the underlying issues or of the Bank 
strategy for addressing the problem. Most explicit of the governance-related CAS 
objectives were expansion of participatory framework to promote active community 
involvement in development projects and strengthening of the country financial 
management and procurement systems to improve accountability and transparency in the 

59 

 
 
                                                           
 
                                                              Annex 5 

 Page 9 of 15 

use of public resources. Other objectives mentioned in the CAS included to enhance 
public sector efficiency by strengthening link between policy, planning and budget 
allocation and strengthening of the regulatory framework to promote fair competition and 
encourage private investment. The CAS paid little explicit attention to the issues related 
to corruption and growth of the underground economy. 
29. 
The overall performance appears decidedly mixed. Good progress has been made 
in promoting community involvement in the selection and implementation of community 
infrastructure through NCDP and ICBS projects – leading to better sub-project selection, 
and improved sustainability of the facilities due to greater ownership by the 
beneficiaries30. The Country Fiduciary Assessment, done jointly with the IDB, helped 
identify important issues for strengthening Jamaica’s procurement and financial 
management systems and the follow-up is being supported through an IDF grant. The 
feedback from many implementing agencies indicated, however, continuing delays and 
difficulties related to GOJ’s procurement procedures and practices, suggesting the need 
for a more concerted follow-up in this regard.  
30. 
Not unexpectedly, nothing much happened on the other two objectives given that 
the CAS had no concrete plans for pursuing those objectives. The CAS Progress Report 
attempted to concretize the public sector reform objective by narrowing it down to 
improving the planning, budgeting and monitoring systems in the Ministry of Education 
through the ROSE II project. However, even that narrower objective got derailed due to a 
questionable dropping of the governance component following restructuring of the ROSE 
II project31. 
31. 
The recently approved DPL brings much needed attention to the governance 
theme—a theme crucial to the longer-term prospects for Jamaica. Among other things, 
the DPL supports actions aimed at rationalization of public bodies, improving efficiency 
and effectiveness of public sector compensation and incentives, improving the accounting 
and financial reporting system, improving internal and external control systems, reducing 
distortions in the tax systems, and enhancing the tax administration32. This is a large 
agenda and significant progress will require sustained efforts over several years. 
32. Were it not for the actions initiated under the DPL, the CAS performance under 
the governance theme would have merited an unsatisfactory rating. 

Cross-cutting Theme II: Environmental Sustainability (Moderately 
Satisfactory) 

33. 
In the absence of a comprehensive assessment of the environmental challenges 
and options facing Jamaica, the agenda under the environmental sustainability theme 

30  Based on the beneficiary feedback the community-based contracting under these projects also 
contributed to skills development in the community including development of management skills, 
bookkeeping skills, conflict resolution and communication skills, and construction skills 

31 This is likely to be taken up as part of the Educational Transformation Project, currently under 
preparation (Para. 23). 
32 This would be complemented by parallel support from IDB for improving the incentive framework and 
the business environment for the private sector.

Page 10 of 15 

focused on two outcomes: enhancing GOJ’s capacity to respond to natural catastrophes 
and mainstreaming environmental consideration in investment planning. The Bank did a 
commendable job in helping Jamaica participate in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk 
Insurance Facility (CCRIF) against natural hazards. The Bank also showed commendable 
flexibility and speed both in modifying NCDP following the Hurricane Ivan and in 
approving an Emergency Recovery Loan to help Jamaica deal with the aftermath of 
Hurricane Dean. The Emergency Loan, being implemented through the JSIF, aims to 
restore basic community infrastructure in education, health and transport damaged by the 
Hurricane Dean and also to increase the GOJ’s ability to respond to natural hazards. After 
a somewhat slow start, the project now appears to be progressing satisfactorily. As 
regards mainstreaming of environmental considerations, certification of JSIF for ISO 
14000 is a major achievement allowing the Bank to rely on country’s own environmental 
management systems. 
34. Considering the frequency with which natural catastrophes impact Jamaica, the CAS 
was remiss in not recognizing and addressing such threats more proactively (e.g., through 
greater realism in target-setting as well as contingency planning). The CAS would have 
also benefited from a comprehensive Country Environmental Assessment to help define 
the priority agenda for future support by the Bank under this theme.  

IV. 

 BANK PERFORMANCE 

34. 
The overall Bank performance for the CAS period is rated moderately 
satisfactory based on missed opportunities as well as scope for improvement in terms of 
Quality of Products and Services, in portfolio management, and in Country Dialogue and 
Aid Coordination. 
A. Quality of Products and Services (Moderately Satisfactory) 

35.      Program delivery: Lending. The planned and actual lending deliveries over the 
CAS period are summarized in Annex E.3. The CAS proposed a base case lending 
program of $75 million for four investment projects during FY06-09. The high case 
scenario included an additional $75 million for policy-based lending subject to 
satisfactory portfolio performance as well as satisfactory macroeconomic performance in 
line with the GOJ’s MTF. Based on the encouraging macroeconomic trends during 
2006/07, Jamaica was shifted to the high case as part of the CAS Progress Report to the 
Board in July, 2007. Although the improvements in macro-economic trends reported in 
the CAS PR turned out to be short-lived, the change in government following the October 
2007 elections led to a more intensive dialogue between GOJ and the Bank, and stepped-
up lending by the Bank going beyond the confines of the original CAS.  
36.     Actual deliveries during the CAS period comprised six operations for a total of 
$204.3 million substantially above the level envisaged under the base case scenario. In 
part, the enlarged program reflected emergency response to Hurricane Dean. More 
importantly, however, it reflected recalibration of the assistance strategy in light of the 
new government’s resolve to address the long standing economic problems of Jamaica. 
Most important manifestation of this new relationship was a $100 million Development 
Policy Loan (DPL) by the Bank approved in January 2009 to help initiate policy and 

61 

 
 
                                                          
 
                                                              Annex 5 

Page 11 of 15 

institutional reforms to put Jamaica on a sustainable development path (Para. 16). A 
follow-up operation to continue the reforms initiated under DPL I is also under 
preparation. 
37.      Of the four projects envisaged under the CAS, two –the Inner City Basic Services 
Project (ICBS) and the Early Childhood Development (ECD) Project—have already been 
approved, the latter, one year behind schedule due to delays in preparation. The third 
project (Youth at Risk), expanded and refocused on continuation of support for the PATH 
program, has also been approved through a $40 million loan in FY08. The fourth project 
(Rural Development) is under preparation and is expected to be delivered in FY10. The 
project will build on the successful experience under NCDP I but unlike that project will 
focus on support for productive investments to stimulate growth of the rural economy by 
enabling farmers to better access markets and by encouraging pro-poor tourism. A 
commendable feature of both the ECD project and the Social Protection project is the 
move made towards the SWAp modality, thereby bringing added focus on outputs and 
outcomes as well as greater reliance on GOJ’s own budgetary and fiduciary mechanisms.  
38.      Besides the two unplanned operations noted in para. 36 (Emergency Recovery 
Loan for Hurricane Dean and the DPL), the actual program also included one other 
project not foreseen under the CAS—A US$10 million loan to help sustain past Bank 
support for combating HIV/AIDS. Given the multiplicity of donors active in the 
HIV/AIDS area, as well as emerging health sector priorities, there is some question as to 
whether the overall impact could have been increased through shifting the focus of this 
operation on broader health sector issues accompanied, if necessary, by some support for 
sustaining the gains of the previous project through Additional Financing. A constraining 
factor in that respect appears to have been the lack of sound diagnostic analysis of the 
health sector to underpin the design of a broader health sector project.   
39.      Excepting a few isolated cases, the lending program during the CAS period 
appears well targeted to the country priorities and was suitably adjusted to take account 
of the emerging opportunities and needs. None of the six projects approved during the 
CAS period has been subject to a Quality at Entry assessment by QAG and hence there is 
no independent feedback available on the design quality of these projects. However, 
summary reviews for the CASCR suggest that generally the projects were well-designed 
with due attention to fiduciary and safeguard aspects as well as to lessons from the past. 
An area for improvement would have been the results frameworks underpinning these 
projects as well as the M&E arrangements for tracking progress during implementation. 
Missing base line data also appeared to be a common problem. Ensuring better readiness 
for implementation before approval should be another priority to help minimize 
subsequent delays in project effectiveness and extension of closing dates. 
40.     In some cases, the project designs could have also been improved through more 
careful attention to the contextual factors. Thus, for example a better recognition of the 
fiscal constraints bearing upon the ROSE II project would have avoided the painful 
restructuring that the project had to go through subsequently. Similarly, greater attention 
to the social setting bearing on the ICBS project would have avoided some of the 
contracting problems being experienced now. The recently approved ECD project would 
have also benefited from greater recognition of the difficulties in launching a new 
initiative such as that.  

62 

 
 
                                                          
 
                                                              Annex 5 

Page 12 of 15 

41.    Overall, the lending program delivery appears to have been managed efficiently 
with delivery costs and elapsed times well below the Bank norms. The elapsed time 
between Board approval and PCN issuance averaged 7.6 months compared to the Bank-
wide average of 14.3 months. The average delivery cost for the six Jamaica operations 
($326,000) also compares favorably with the Bank-wide average ($341,000). Also 
indicative of the efficient management of the lending pipeline is the negligible amount 
spent on “dropped” projects. 
42.     Program delivery: AAA (Moderately Unsatisfactory). Based on the country 
service budget data for Jamaica during FY06-0933, out of a total expenditure of $4.35 
million, only about $350,000 was spent on AAA—less than 9% of the total budget and 
far below the 25-30% range found in most Bank country programs. Altogether, there 
were just four AAA tasks undertaken by the Bank during the CAS period: Poverty 
Analysis, FSAP, Energy Sector Policy and TA for Addressing Debt Problems. 
43.     The sparse AAA expenditure for Jamaica during the CAS period needs to be seen, 
of course, in the context of an extensive program of studies undertaken by the Bank 
focusing on the Caribbean Region as a whole. Over the four-year CAS period,  seven  
regional studies were completed including Caribbean Growth and Competitiveness 
(FY06), Caribbean Social Protection Strategy Review (FY06), Caribbean Infrastructure 
Assessment (FY06), Caribbean Skills Enhancement FY07), Caribbean Pensions (FY07), 
Caribbean Crime and Violence  (FY07), Caribbean Air Transport (FY07), and The 
Canada-Caribbean Remittance Corridor (FY09) with a total delivered cost of $1.6 
million. Many of these regional studies were indeed of relevance to Jamaica and helped 
in the Bank country dialogue. However, for Jamaica to match the Bank wide norms on 
AAA spending, an improbably high two-thirds of the total budget for the regional studies 
would have to be allocated to Jamaica. Thus, the Bank resources devoted to AAA were 
rather low, suggesting significant under-investment by the Bank in building its 
knowledge base to underpin effective country dialogue. Some of the issues/areas that 
would have benefited from additional analytical work included:  
 better understanding of Jamaica’s dismal record with past reform efforts and lessons 
for the future from that experience;  
robustness of the statistical base underpinning Jamaica’s national accounts and its 
possible impact on assessing Jamaica’s  economic growth trends; 
the priority agenda for controlling the underground economy in Jamaica; 
issues and priorities for putting Jamaica’s social sector (especially health and 
education) on a sustainable path for the medium to long–term; 
 
issues and priorities in managing Jamaica’s natural resources and environment; and 
 
Issues and priorities in stimulating growth of the rural economy34. 
44.     Feedback from the stakeholders during the CASCR mission suggests that the Bank 
AAA is well-regarded all around for its analytical quality. The Bank needs to do however 



 

33 Only partial data for FY09; the overall picture is however unlikely to change even with complete data for 
FY09. 
34 Apparently, a study of the Jamaica Rural Economy was initiated but dropped in FY07 before completion. 

63 

 
 
                                                          
 
                                                 
                                                              Annex 5 

 Page 13 of 15 

a better job of disseminating the findings and recommendations of its AAA, especially to 
stakeholders outside of GOJ and especially for the regional studies relevant to Jamaica. 
Many stakeholders were unaware of the Bank’s regional studies, thus reducing their 
potential impact. (The report on Crime Violence and Development was a notable 
exception in this respect). Other areas for greater attention included more systematic 
economic monitoring and non-lending technical assistance to support capacity building 
for implementation of complex institutional reforms. 
45.    Considering that the country budget is being used rather efficiently with little scope 
for reallocations away from lending and supervision work, it would appear that 
addressing the AAA gaps will require some augmentation of the country budget; that 
should not be unreasonable given shift of the Jamaica program to the High case scenario. 

B.  Portfolio Management (Moderately Satisfactory) 

46.     To-date four projects35 have closed during the CAS period and another one (ROSE 
II) is expected to close on June 30, 2009. Although none of the closed projects has yet 
been evaluated by the IEG, staff ratings of project status in the respective ICRs/ISRs 
suggest that all five are expected to achieve their developmental objectives. If confirmed 
by the IEG evaluations, this will represent a significant break from the past track record 
as 38% of the Jamaican projects closed since FY90 have failed to achieve their 
developmental objectives.  
47.    With six new approvals and five exits during the CAS period, the active portfolio at 
end FY09 will comprise five projects. The ISR ratings suggest satisfactory outlook for all 
five projects. However, discussions with some of the implementing agencies during the 
CASCR mission indicate that in some cases, the ISR ratings may be on the generous side 
and may underestimate the challenges in bringing those projects to satisfactory 
completion. In particular, it appears that the ICBP and the ECD projects will need 
intensive supervision given their implementation experience so far and the innovative 
designs of the two projects.  
48.     None of the projects under supervision during the CAS period has been subject to 
independent QAG assessment; review of  project documents and discussions with TTLs 
suggest, however, good performance overall by the Bank in assisting the clients in timely 
identification of problems and in providing sound professional advice to help address 
those problems. The supervision efforts seem to be adequately resourced with supervision 
coefficient similar to Bank wide norms. The supervision also appears to be getting 
reasonable managerial oversight from the country and the sector units.  
49.    The main area for improvement during supervision is the quality and timeliness of 
advice and assistance to clients in resolving procurement issues. Several implementing 
agencies noted, besides slow response, lack of continuity in staffing of procurement 
related supervision as well as inconsistencies in advice provided by the different missions 
in some cases. The supervision reporting will also benefit from more carefully chosen 
performance indicators as well as timely data reporting on the selected indicators. The 
recent joint GOJ/Bank CPPR also rightly highlight the need for better management of 

35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, NCDP I, Social Safety Net Project, and DPL I. 

64 

 
 
                                                         
 
                                                 
                                                              Annex 5 

Page 14 of 15 

effectiveness delays and frequent extension of closing dates leading to delayed project 
benefits. The feedback from GOJ also suggested need for further decentralization of the 
Bank supervision support, especially for the fiduciary functions. 

C.  Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination (Moderately Satisfactory) 
50.    All through the CAS period the Bank enjoyed cordial relations with GOJ, 
successfully overcoming the past perceptions about the Bank being an advocate of 
structural adjustment 
through conditionality. The election of a reform-minded 
government in 2007 further strengthened the Bank country dialogue leading to upgrading 
of the CAS program to the high case scenario. The government counterparts appeared 
generally appreciative of the advice and assistance provided by the Bank during the CAS 
implementation. Also commended were the Bank’s speed and flexibility in helping 
Jamaica cope with the natural disasters.   
51.    The Bank also did a good job during the CAS preparation in consulting a wide 
spectrum of stakeholders including NGOs, Chambers of Commerce, trade unions and 
academic institutions. However, the Bank was not as successful in sustaining this dialog 
during the CAS implementation. For much of the CAS period, the Bank had only a 
skeleton presence on the ground (single, locally recruited professional staff) and outreach 
to various stakeholders was left mainly to visiting Bank missions. The situation appears 
to have improved considerably following upgrading of the Bank office in March 2008. 
Nevertheless, there is scope for the Bank to further intensify its engagement with these 
non-governmental constituencies both to understand better their view point and 
perspectives and to explain to them the logic behind the policies and programs supported 
by the Bank. Worth special mention in this regard is the need to assure adequate 
dissemination of the findings from the Bank’s AAA. Maintenance of a user-friendly, up-
to-date website should be another priority. 
52.    Jamaica has been a pilot country for reducing the transactions costs of development 
assistance through harmonization of donor policies, programs and procedures. During the 
CAS period, the Bank work proactively to harmonize its assistance with those of others, 
especially IDB and EU who together with the World Bank are the three major 
development partners for Jamaica. Some of the specific steps in that regard included: (a) 
joint consultations with non-governmental stakeholders by IDB, DFID, CDB and WB to 
inform their respective country strategies; (b) joint country fiduciary assessment by IDB 
and WB to support country procurement and financial management systems agreeable to 
both Banks; (c) preparation of PEFA jointly by EU and the WB to underpin a common 
donor approach under the DPL; and (d) preparation of FSAP jointly by IMF and WB. 
IDB and WB also designed their assistance strategies to complement each others with the 
World Bank focusing on social sectors and the IDB on private sector development. The 
Bank also worked closely with the IMF in analyzing and advising on the macro-
economic issues. 
53.    Notwithstanding the progress made to-date, there is scope for doing better 
particularly through timely information sharing among donors; apparently, many donor 
staff located in Jamaica would like to do that but are prevented by confidentiality rules 
established by the respective HQs. Donor feedback during the CASCR mission also 

65 

 
 
                                                          
 
 
                                                              Annex 5 

Page 15 of 15 

suggested that during processing of the recent DPL, the cooperation among IDB, EU and 
the WB was not as good as it could have been with the three co-financiers unduly focused 
on establishing the primacy of their individual contributions. The Bank should also make 
efforts to strengthen its dialog and cooperation with the UN agencies in Jamaica, 
especially UNICEF and FAO. To reduce aid management costs to Jamaica and to 
promote greater coherence in the advice and assistance to Jamaica, the three main 
partners, EU, IDB and WB may consider adopting a joint assistance strategy for Jamaica. 
Shifting to the SWAp modality using country fiduciary and safeguard systems would be 
another area for improving donor harmonization and aid effectiveness.  
54.    Without exception, both GOJ and other stakeholders were appreciative of the recent 
posting by the Bank of a senior staff in Jamaica and felt that it had greatly helped in 
improving the country dialogue as well as interaction among external partners.  

V. 

 LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE 

55.    The performance under the current CAS suggests six lessons for the future: 
 Be more realistic in setting targets for CAS outcomes paying due attention to the 
financial and institutional constraints as well as to Jamaica’s high vulnerability to 
natural hazards; 
 Ensure that projects are dimensioned with due regards for Jamaica’s fiscal 
constraints—a successful project can always be scaled up as a repeater project or 
through additional financing; 
 Revisit sectoral priorities to ensure that focus on social sectors is complemented by 
adequate attention to growth issues. Issues of governance and corruption should be 
another focal area for the future; 
 Strengthen supervision of procurement aspects, if possible, through decentralization 
(perhaps through a mini-hub dealing with the Caribbean countries); 
 Ensure adequate funding for analytical and advisory work including its dissemination 
and outreach; and 
 Further strengthen aid coordination, especially vis-à-vis IDB and EU. Consider 
possibility of a joint CAS by the key partners.
