EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: A COUNTRY AT THE CROSSROADS 

1. 
This Joint Assistance Strategy for Sierra Leone (“JAS”), prepared by the African 
Development Bank Group (AfDB) the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation  
(“the JAS partners”), sets out planned lending and non-lending support, and possible 
investments, for the period FY2010 to 2013. 

2. 
Seven years out of brutal conflict, Sierra Leone is now peaceful and stable. Sierra Leone 
has already had two full-fledged, peaceful, and credible elections for President, Parliament, and 
local councils. The 2007 elections saw a peaceful and orderly transition of power from the 
government to the opposition party. While the daily economic and social hardships experienced 
by large parts of the population make peace and stability quite fragile, flashes of violence and 
potential relapses of stability have been few. A recent Joint Communiqué that outlined a concord 
of political behavior among the political parties exemplifies the growing maturity of the national 
dialogue.  

3. 
Improved governance remains a sine-qua non for the preservation of social peace in the 
future.  Corruption and poor governance are major challenges in this fragile state, with its legacy 
of civil war preceded by decades of mismanagement, its culture of patronage politics, and its 
susceptibility to negative influences associated with the diamond wealth. Nevertheless, in recent 
years notable steps have been taken, including strengthening the Anti-Corruption Commission 
(ACC) by giving it prosecutorial powers. The president, ministers, members of Parliament, and 
senior officials now must declare their assets to the ACC. A Freedom of Information Act, drafted 
primarily by civil society organizations is being finalized for submission to Parliament. In a 
frank acknowledgment of weaknesses, and recognizing the potential to use international ratings 
as guide, Government has explicitly stated its intention to achieve improvements in the country’s 
Transparency International ratings, Doing Business ratings, and World Bank/AfDB Country 
Policy and Institutional Assessment ratings. 

4. 
Regional challenges and integration. Sierra Leone remains challenged politically and 
economically by the vulnerability of the sub-region (the Mano River Union countries). 
Regional cooperation must be high on the national agenda, to take advantage of more effective 
regional infrastructure, reap economic benefits from trade and investment, and also to contain a 
history of instability in one country spilling over into its neighbors. Being on the shortest route 
between Latin America and Europe has positioned West Africa as a transit point for drug 
trafficking; this emerging threat requires regional cooperation. Sierra Leone is also active in the 
African Union, assuming a championship role for the common approach to agricultural 
development, and in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for regional 
integration. 

5. 
Since the end of the civil war the economy has grown at nearly 10 percent a year on 
average, led by agriculture, construction, services, and mining. The current global economic 
crisis has hit the economy, lowering remittances, and causing the price of diamonds, the main 
export item, to fall by close to 40 percent. Other minerals too have been hard hit. Nevertheless, 
economic growth seems likely to have settled at around 4 percent in 2009, with higher growth 
1 

 
 
 
predicted for 2010, led by a recovery of agriculture and robust performance in construction and 
services. Underpinning the recovery thus far has been fairly stable economic and fiscal 
management, implemented under the difficult circumstances of significant reconstruction needs.  

6. 
As could be expected in the early years after conflict, foreign investment into Sierra 
Leone has been limited except for core mining operations. Encouragingly, signs of greater 
interest can be seen,  in agriculture, mining, and tourism. Lack of infrastructure, a weak 
regulatory environment, and a weak financial sector have all contributed to the lack of 
investment. However, significant public investments in energy and roads are close to coming 
onstream, and substantive improvements in the regulatory framework have helped Sierra Leone 
climb in the Doing Business ratings. The banking sector has improved significantly, with more 
improvement expected under a new financial sector strategy. A recent Trade and Investment 
Conference in London indicated growing confidence in Sierra Leone as an investment 
destination, with significant agreements being discussed. 

7. 
Youth unemployment (underemployment and employment without secure remuneration) 
is difficult to quantify but remains a social, economic, and security challenge. As a result of 
the civil war, a generation of young people received little if any schooling. Many were uprooted 
from rural areas and sought refuge in cities, notably Freetown. Creating jobs, primarily through 
private sector growth and skills improvement (especially vocational training) supplemented by 
works programs, will be a key challenge. Because much of the economic growth is expected to 
be in agriculture, job creation may depend upon young people’s willingness to relocate from 
cities to villages and towns. As the 2012 elections draw nearer, youth unemployment may 
increasingly become an issue of peace and stability that needs to be managed. 

8. 
Sierra Leone is still a country of very high poverty, with an absolute poverty headcount 
in 2007 of more than 60 percent. Even this figure represents a significant fall of between 6 and 
8 percent since the end of the conflict. Given the current global crisis, there are risks that poverty 
rates may start rising again.  

9. Despite the fall in poverty rates, Sierra Leone still remains close to the bottom of the UN 
Human Development Index. Health outcomes, notably the world’s highest child and maternal 
mortality rates, are a significant explanation for this ranking. Since the war, the availability of 
services has improved significantly, in line with the decentralization and devolution of authority 
to local authorities. The proportion of population with access to a health clinic within 30 minutes 
has risen from 29 percent to 49 percent. And, through support from a variety of health initiatives, 
there may be early signs of a fall in mortality, particularly among children under five.1 The 
government has announced plans to ensure free access to healthcare for mothers and children by 
2010, and this has created a significant organizational and financial challenge. In education, 
enrollment rates have risen significantly. Sierra Leone will probably have poor human 
development indicators (HDI) for years to come, but a move out of the bottom positions is 
feasible in the relatively near future.. 

10. The very unsatisfactory human development outcomes underscore important gender 
issues. Women are particularly vulnerable, with higher poverty rates and lower secondary school 

1 The provisional results of the Sierra Leone 2008 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) indicate that the infant 
and under-five child mortality rates have significantly improved to 89 and 140 per 1,000 live births, respectively. 

2 

 
                                                 
enrolment rates, in addition to high maternal mortality rates. Women are more than half the 
nation’s farmers, and with women’s economic empowerment emerging as a priority, a gender 
strategy encompassing both social improvement and economic opportunity is required. Lack of 
capacity is a major constraint and a cause of governance weaknesses. To strengthen capacity 
calls for significant and concerted efforts by the government, supported by development partners, 
including efforts to mobilize latent capacity in civil society and the diaspora. 

11. Encouraged by the progress made in the post-conflict years, the government is 
addressing the significant challenges in human development, youth employment, and 
infrastructure. A new national strategy—the second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-
II), under the name “Agenda for Change”—has been prepared to address these challenges. The 
strategy emphasizes broadly based, equitable growth and human development. Government will 
support the growth agenda through investment focused on three priority areas: (a) agriculture, (b) 
energy, and (c) transport infrastructure, all of which have significant potential to unleash growth. 
The human development agenda will focus on improved basic services in education, health, and 
water/sanitation, including an initiative to provide free healthcare for children and nursing 
mothers, starting in 2010. As underlying principles for these priorities, the strategy emphasizes 
private sector development, good governance, prudent management of natural resources, and 
macroeconomic stability. Key risk areas identified by the government include governance and 
corruption, youth employment, and illicit drugs (particularly transit activities). 

12. Financing the Agenda for Change. Government revenues have remained at about 11 
percent of GDP since 2003—a level too low to maintain even the basic public sector 
requirements of a low-income country. As such, the government continues to rely on 
development assistance for recurrent expenditures (which are equivalent to 14.5 percent of 
GDP). It has taken steps to increase the revenue, and more are underway, including the January 
2010 introduction of a value added tax—the Goods and Services Tax—which replaces seven 
existing taxes. For much of the period since the civil war, the use of aid funds and the modalities 
for delivering these funds have been governed by the demands of early post-conflict recovery, 
which has meant that a significant part of the funding was used for security and peace-building 
activities, often through ad hoc delivery modalities. There is now a growing demand from 
government, accepted by the country’s development partners, to adjust the profile of spending 
and the modalities of aid delivery to reflect the agreements of Paris and Accra. Sierra Leone 
already receives significant external aid per capita (approximately US$65 per capita) and a 
recent Consultative Group meeting confirmed expectations of such a level being maintained, 
with possible increases from new partners. 

13. A new aid policy has been prepared to guide partners’ support for the Agenda for 
Change. The policy focuses on country ownership of the process, consolidation of programs, 
alignment with sector priorities, increased use of sectorwide approaches (SWAps), and a much 
higher percentage of programs staying “on budget.” Development partners have committed to 
working with the government on full implementation of the new Aid Policy, including through 
an Aid Effectiveness Forum in 2010. 

14. Joint Assistance Strategy. The World Bank Group (IDA, IFC, MIGA) and African 
Development Bank Group operations, analytical work, and policy dialogue will support all the 
key elements of the Agenda for Change. The JAS complements other partners’ strategies for 
assisting Sierra Leone, notably an existing DfID/EC strategy and a new joint UN family strategy 
3 

 
called the Joint Vision. The JAS partners consulted widely in preparing the JAS, through 
meetings in all parts of the country, and through consultations with government, development 
partners (notably Germany plus the budget support partners), civil society, and the private sector. 
The JAS is fully aligned with the Agenda for Change/PRSP. 

15. Like the Agenda for Change, the JAS is organized around two pillars: growth and 
human development. The Growth pillar provides financing for investments in agriculture, 
fisheries, energy, transport, and the financial sector. The Human Development pillar focuses on 
investments to support decentralized delivery in health, education, and water supply, as well as 
dedicated support to primary education (EFA-FTI) and reproductive and child health, to address 
child and maternal mortality.  

16. 
 The JAS also features two cross-cutting themes: governance and private sector 
development. The JAS has a focus to help strengthen governance and address governance issues 
in operations, including proposals for a governance advisory group, a governance dialogue with 
the government, and guidance to JAS partner staff. Opportunities for private-sector-led growth 
are being sought in all sectors, including those dealing with human development. As gender 
disparities are a strong factor in Sierra Leone society, the JAS partners will address gender issues 
across their portfolio. 

17. JAS resources. Jointly, over the three-year period, the JAS partners (AfDB, IDA, and 
IFC) expect to mobilize nearly US$300 million in support to Sierra Leone’s development 
agenda. As IDA’s envelope for Sierra Leone is currently limited by the country’s low CPIA 
ratings (averaging some US$30 million a year), leveraging resources will play a significant role 
and will enable a broader engagement. It is expected that the resource envelope could more than 
double through operational leverage from regional IDA, trust funds, and vertical funds. The 
AfDB expects to have a resource envelope under African Development Fund (ADF)12 of UA 70 
million, which translates to $35 million annually over the three-year funding cycle, including 
resources from the Fragile States Facility (FSF). Financing of private sector operations, such as 
the Addax Bio-energy Project that the AfDB intends to co-finance, would provide additional 
resources beyond this envelope.  

18. At the end of the JAS period, the JAS partners expect to see specific results in improved 
delivery of basic services (health, education, and water). Other expected growth outcomes are 
increases in agricultural production, coverage of feeder roads, access to electricity, access to 
finance, and an improved business environment. Improvements in governance, with expected 
higher CPIA ratings as the proxy, are a central part of the results framework. 

19. 
 Coordination between the JAS partners is now well developed. During the JAS period 
AfDB will focus new resources on major investments in the road network and on investments in 
water and sanitation, while IDA will focus on human development improvements, notably 
through decentralized service delivery; on youth employment and skills; on public sector reform; 
and on energy sector investments. IFC will focus on financial intermediation, agriculture, and 
tourism as likely areas for investments. More broadly, the World Bank Group and the AfDB, 
DfID, and the EC cooperate closely not only as the providers of budget support to government 
but also as key partners in a policy dialogue not least related to governance and gender issues. In 
addition, IDA has developed close working relationships with the German Development 
Cooperation agency in the field of private and financial sector development and with the Japan 
4 

 
International Cooperation Agency in the energy sector. Both AfDB and the World Bank also 
work closely with the UN agencies, both individually and through coordinating the activities of 
the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL). The World Bank 
and UNIPSIL jointly co-chair partner meetings, under government chairmanship.  

20. Organization of the JAS. Section I below sets forth a preliminary assessment of the 
country context and prospects, including Sierra Leone’s major challenges and opportunities and 
the responses of the government and international community. Section II discusses the country’s 
development program and Section III examines challenges and opportunities. Section IV reviews 
the implementation of the last CAS (FY06–09) and the last AfDB country support program 
(2005–09). Section V discusses the proposed joint AfDB/IDA/IFC strategy and its constituent 
pillars. Finally, Section VI analyzes the risks to the successful implementation of the JAS and the 
approaches by which these risks will be managed and mitigated.

I. 

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

A. Political Economy and Developments  

1. 
Following the 2002 end of a decade-long civil war, peace has been consolidated in 
Sierra Leone. Among the countries designated as “post-conflict” by IDA and “fragile state” by 
AfDB, Sierra Leone is one of the few to have achieved a democratic transition of government. 
International observers broadly agreed that the 2007 elections—the second Presidential and 
Parliamentary elections to be held since the end of the civil war—were free, fair, and credible. 
Recent political events indicate that a sustainable pluralistic, democratic system is gradually 
being established. A peace and reconciliation process, including a special court, has largely 
completed the task of bringing closure to the atrocities of the conflict period. Nevertheless, a 
history of complicated political economy and clientelism, the corrosive long-standing influence 
of the alluvial diamond industry, pervasive youth unemployment, and regional instability all 
mean that the situation remains fragile, as demonstrated by occasional clashes in urban centers 
between supporters of the government and main opposition parties. 

2. Despite progress, particularly with economic growth and a fall in poverty, Sierra Leone’s 
economic recovery remains fragile, and the country continues to rank among the least 
advantaged countries on various measures. Sierra Leone was ranked 180 of 182 countries in the 
2008–09 UNDP Human Development Index rankings, despite its seven years of high economic 
growth. Much remains to be done to tackle high levels of unemployment; infant, child, and 
maternal death rates that are among the world’s worst; and a very high youth dependency ratio. 
Gender disparities and the high vulnerability of women are yet to be addressed. Weaknesses in 
infrastructure (energy, water, ports, and roads) and in access to quality finance (notably rural 
finance) hold back development across all sectors. Inequality remains a concern. Young people 
of both sexes are more likely to be socially excluded. Sierra Leone is also vulnerable to external 
shocks. Most recently, global economic volatility (sharp increases in food prices in 2008 
followed by steep declines in commodity demand and prices in 2009) has exacerbated poverty, 
particularly among the young urban and peri-urban populations. Unless economic growth can be 
sustained and employment opportunities increased, accompanied by a sustained improvement in 
governance, there is a real risk that the progress made thus far will be undermined.  

B. Recent Economic Developments  

3. 
Sierra Leone’s economic performance post-conflict was initially robust, but it has slowed 
recently as a result of global instability. The growth rate slowed to 5.5 percent in 2008 and an 
estimated 4.0 percent in 2009 (see 1 below), as a result of the food and fuel price escalations of 
2008 and of the global recession that followed and sharply reduced world demand for Sierra 
Leone’s mineral exports. These adverse developments have highlighted the need for Sierra 
Leone to reduce its dependence on imported food and fuel and to develop new engines of growth 
to diversify away from reliance on mineral exports. The economy is on the right track in this 
regard: exports have been gradually diversifying into cash crops, notably cocoa but also palm oil 
and other products, while the completion of the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Project in late 2009 will 
6 

 
 
 
 
have reduced the need for imported fuel (and save foreign exchange). There is also a need to 
maintain productivity growth, which has been high but constrained by lack of access to finance 
and by the informal nature of the economy, with formal sector activity confined primarily to 
large-scale mining, construction, retail services, tourism, and government employment.  

Figure 1: Primary sources of GDP growth and economic sector composition 2002-08 

4. 
The global recession has challenged the economy. The share of exports of goods and non-
factor services in GDP fell from 20.8 percent in 2007 to 16.3 percent in 2008 and an estimated 
15.7 percent in 2009 (see 1), as the result of the global slowdown and the collapse of operations 
in two mines.2 Sierra Leone’s external current account balance (including official transfers) 
worsened to -11.2 percent of GDP in 2008 from -3.4 percent of GDP in 2007, on account of a 
rise in food and fuel prices during the first half of the year and lower diamond prices in the 
second half. The estimated balance for 2009 has improved slightly to - 9.4 percent of GDP, as 
the share of imports in GDP has fallen from 29.4 percent in 2008 to 28.5 percent in 2009. The 
current account balance has been financed mainly by concessional external assistance and debt 
relief. Official reserves in 2009 are estimated to have increased to US$333 million (6.5 percent 
of imports), following a new SDR allocation made in response to the global crisis.  

5. 
The financial sector, still developing from a low base, has remained relatively immune 
from the global financial crisis.  The number of banks has continued to grow, from 13 in 2008 
to 14 in 2009 while the branch network expanded from 57 in 2008 to 73 in 2009. Private sector 
credit increased by Le 172 billion (approximately 50 percent) in the 12 months to October 2009. 
The most direct exposure to upheaval in the overseas financial sector has been to Nigeria, where 
the central bank was required to step in to support several banks, a small number of which are 
represented in Sierra Leone. To address these issues a Memorandum of Understanding was 
signed with the Central Bank of Nigeria for sharing supervisory information and enhancing 
cooperation in banking supervision. In addition, a draft Credit Reference Bill, that will create an 
improvement in the banks’ credit portfolio was approved by Cabinet in 2009 and will soon be 
transmitted to Parliament. Banking supervision is being changed from compliance-based to risk-
based supervision.  

2 The Koidu kimberlite diamond operation was halted due to structural problems in the main mine shaft. The 
planned expansion of rutile operations was halted when the second dredge capsized shortly after commissioning.

6. 
Inflation has slowed but exchange rate depreciation has accelerated. The sharp increases 
in the international prices of food and fuel in the first half of 2008 pushed up the rate of inflation 
to a period average of 14.8 percent in 2008, from 11.7 percent in 2007 (see Table 1). The 
recession-induced decline in many world prices that began in the second half of 2008 and 
continued into the first half of 2009 helped to slow inflation to an estimated 9.5 percent in 2009. 
But reductions in foreign exchange receipts from exports and remittances put substantial pressure 
on the exchange rate, which depreciated by almost 30 percent against the US dollar between 
January and December of 2009. The nominal end-of-period Treasury bill rate fell from 21 
percent in 2007 to 9 percent in 2008, largely due to increased depth in the Sierra Leone’s 
financial sector, but rose to around 15 percent in 2009. 

7. After seven years of continuous improvement, the fiscal balance deteriorated modestly in 
2008. The overall balance (after grants) had improved from -10.6 percent of GDP in 2001 to -
8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.0 percent of GDP by 2007.3 But in 2008 it worsened to -4.8 percent of GDP (see Table 1). 
This was largely because grants fell substantially below the budgeted level and expenditures 
were not adjusted enough to compensate. The 2009 outcome was slightly better, with a deficit 
of 4.4 percent of GDP made possible mainly by stronger external grants. Domestic revenues 
have remained stuck at around 11 percent of GDP, necessitating a strong reliance on donor 
support. 

C. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability 

8. 
The global economic prospects for traded goods, and continued domestic investment, 
will allow Sierra Leone to regain a high rate of growth. Real GDP growth is forecast to 
gradually return to its pre-recession levels: projections are for 4.7 percent in 2010 and 6.0 
percent by 2012. Exports are projected to rebound to 18 percent of GDP by 2010 and to 19 
percent in 2011 and 2012. Imports of fuel should be substantially reduced by the low-cost 
hydroelectric power now available from Bumbuna. The current account deficit is expected to 
resume its original trend towards balance, improving to -8.7 percent of GDP in 2010 and -7.2 
percent by 2012. Gross official reserves are expected to stabilize at 5.5 months of import cover 
by 2012. 

9. 
Sierra Leone’s fiscal policy in the medium term will be geared to raising investments 
while reducing the domestic primary fiscal deficit to -2.7 percent of GDP by 2012. This is 
expected to be achieved through increased revenue mobilization, because the government aims 
to maintain macroeconomic stability while also reducing the share of recurrent expenses in the 
budget. New and planned tax measures include the Goods and Services Tax, a value-added tax 
introduced in January 2010, and a major modernization plan  that the National Revenue 
Authority is implementing with support from  DfID and FIAS (customs; income tax; a Gold and 
Diamond Office;  non-tax revenues; taxpayer identification number; and  integrated revenue 
information system ). Domestic credit made available by the central bank will be restricted to 
reduce domestic interest rates and provide scope for expanding credit to the private sector.  

10. The scenario above carries some risks, the main risk being that the global recession will 
be longer  than expected. A number of factors could mitigate this risk. Output growth should 
benefit from the improvement in the supply of electricity from the Bumbuna Hydroelectric 
Project, while demand for foreign exchange for fuel imports is reduced. This should help to spur 
job creation and, as a secondary effect, increase urban demand for rural products. In the medium 
term, the poverty reduction strategy is intended to help diversify exports, particularly with regard 
to agricultural products. Mining sector prospects could be facilitated through the new legal 
framework for the mining sector. Medium-term fiscal policies combined with prudent monetary 
policies should reduce the end-of-period inflation rate from 9.5 percent in 2009 to 8.0 percent in 
2010 and 6.0 percent by 2012. 

11. Offshore oil discoveries, while not yet confirmed to be commercially viable, and possibly 
larger than previously expected iron ore deposits may change the country’s economic 
prospects and dialogue. The commercial viability of the oil reserve discovery will probably not 

3 For compatibility with the government’s own fiscal tables, the data omit credits for MDRI debt reduction. The 
fiscal balances are strongly positive in 2007 when MDRI credits are included.

be determined until 2011, and oil revenues will certainly not become a factor during the current 
JAS and PRSP. Nonetheless, the prospect of future revenue may change expectations and 
behavior. There are also indications that the availability of Iron Ore may be much larger than 
current proven reserves. Sierra Leone was a relative latecomer to EITI, but has recently engaged 
more fully. As it  nears the completion of its first report to the Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative (EITI) Secretariat, followed by EITI validation, there will be international and domestic 
interest in seeing the oil prospects addressed within the context of the EITI from the outset, as 
resource management may be a key governance challenge in the JAS period.

12. A December 2009 debt sustainability analysis (DSA) concluded that Sierra Leone’s risk 
of debt distress is moderate. Debt sustainability will depend on sustained export growth and 
prudent debt management. Barring large unexpected shocks, external debt indicators will remain 
below the HIPC Initiative thresholds throughout the projection period (see Table 2). Public 
sector debt dynamics are projected to remain on a stable path under the baseline scenario. Full 
delivery of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI has significantly reduced Sierra 
Leone’s external public debt. In net present value terms, the stock of debt was reduced from 
US$1,197.6 million at end-2005 to US$483.0 million at end-2006 after HIPC relief, and would 
be further reduced to US$110.0 million after MDRI. This assistance is estimated at some US$1.6 
billion in nominal terms. In the event of large shocks to exports and shortfalls in grant financing, 
debt stock indicators are expected to move towards or breach some HIPC thresholds.  

13. The debt sustainability analysis highlights the continued need for growth-boosting and 
export-enhancing policies and programs, improved domestic revenue mobilization, and the 
containment of low-priority current expenditures. Moreover, Sierra Leone should continue to 
contract new external financing only in the form of grants and highly concessional loans and to 
promote the development of a domestic debt market. 

D. Social Developments and Poverty Profile  

14. Poverty remains high, at around 60 percent, though the poverty rate has fallen since the 
civil war. The 2003–04 Sierra Leone Integrated Household Survey established the poverty 
profile for the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Based on the established poverty line 
thresholds, two out of three people were living below the absolute poverty line at that time (see 

10 

 
 
 
  
Table 3). Additional analysis showed that poverty was more a rural phenomenon, and that urban 
poverty was more prevalent outside Freetown.

15. More recent studies, based on the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire, suggest that 
the national asset-based headcount of poverty decreased from 67.5 percent in 2003 to 61.6 
percent in 2007. The decrease seems to have been much larger in urban than in rural areas, 
probably because post-conflict growth since 2003 has benefited urban areas most. The estimated 
impact of GDP per capita growth on poverty suggests a 9.8 percentage point decrease in poverty 
since 2003—a very large reduction in only four years. Nevertheless, the proportion of the 
population in poverty remains very high, particularly in rural areas (see Figure 2). While 
Freetown has a much lower incidence of poverty than the countryside, it also has pockets of 
severe deprivation, notably among unemployed people who fled the countryside in the war and 
now live in particularly bad slums. Freetown’s population is believed to have almost doubled in 
the past decade, and the urban infrastructure has not been upgraded in decades. The lack of 
economic opportunities for unemployed youth is a significant welfare issue, and also a threat to 
peace and stability.4  

4 Politically motivated rioting in March 2009 in Freetown illustrates the risk that the large number of underemployed 
youth may be mobilized for political purposes.

II. 

COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM: “THE AGENDA FOR CHANGE” 

16. The government has completed the second-generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
(PRSP-II), which covers 2008–12, under the title “Agenda for Change.” As Government 
acknowledges, now that the early gains of the peace dividend are exhausted, future economic and 
social progress will depend largely on the quality of policy decisions and their implementation. 
The Agenda for Change focuses on reducing poverty through economic growth, with emphasis 
on the private sector (see Error! Reference source not found.).  

17. Members of Parliament took part in the consultative process and the Agenda for Change 
17. Members of Parliament took part in the consultative process and the Agenda for Change 
was itself approved by Parliament. The Agenda for Change was launched in June 2009 and 
endorsed by the Boards of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 
October 2009. The strategy was also presented to a Consultative Group meeting held in London 
in November 2009. As a sign of the emphasis on private sector growth, a Trade and Investment 
Conference was held alongside the CG meeting. In addition to this JAS, the UN strategy, the 
Joint Vision, is already fully aligned with the Agenda for Change. Other partners have 
committed to follow suit. A Monitoring and Evaluation plan for the Agenda for Change exists in 
draft and is being further developed.

Box 1: Key priorities in PRSP-II/Agenda for Change 

Human development through the delivery of Basic Services for All 
• 
Improve access, use, and quality of services using government’s decentralized institutional structures. 
Free access to primary health care for priority groups. 
• Ensure that all local councils receive timely and adequate financial resources and capacity development 
support to implement programs that are aligned with national priorities in the basic service sectors such as 
education, health, water, and social protection. 
Agriculture 
• 
Self-sufficiency in rice production through improved technologies, extension, and organization of 
farmers. Meaningful increase in employment in agriculture; food security enhanced. 
• Commercialization of agriculture taking off in cocoa, palm oil, sugar cane, and other crops in which 
Sierra Leone has competitive advantage. Agricultural exports to become significant. 
• 
Sustainable utilization regime for fisheries put in place; government revenues to grow significantly; and 
formal export of higher value fish starting. Job creation in fisheries growing.  
Energy 
• Moving toward lower carbon energy, with Freetown, Bo, and Kenema able to fully utilize hydropower 
energy from Bumbuna and Dodo, through investments in distribution, transmission, reservoir capacity, dam 
safety, and improved operation and maintenance of facilities. 
• 
Provision of grid-based electricity, primarily hydropower and low-carbon-based thermal generation, to 
provincial headquarter towns and key district towns. Embark on rural electrification. 
• 
Improve operations and maintenance of the national utility to incorporate good practices in transmission 
and distribution system planning, new service initiation, demand forecasting, meter reading, billing and 
collection, and staffing. 
• 
Improve sector efficiency through legal and regulatory changes, including long-term energy strategy to 
enable private participation in the sector. Establish link to the West Africa Power Pool.  
Transport 
• Over 2,000 km of feeder roads connecting agriculture to markets rehabilitated.  
• All district headquarters towns connected to national network through class A or B roads. 
• The international link from Guinea through Sierra Leone to Liberia fully reconstructed. 

18. The Agenda for Change is highly selective in its focus and represents the priorities for 
which the government wishes to be held accountable to the people of Sierra Leone. The 
strategy puts forward a target of achieving 10 percent annual GDP growth and its primary 
emphasis is on those sectors—energy, agriculture and transport—that will be key to achieving 
this ambition. Recognizing the slow rate of progress in attaining the MDG indicators, the 
government also addresses the need for renewed emphasis on human development, in building 
the Agenda for Change around four key priorities:  

 Ensuring sustainable human development through expanding access to the basic social 
services and improving coverage of the social protection needs of the poor and 
vulnerable. 

13 

 
 
 
 
 Providing a reliable power supply to the country, and transiting toward a low carbon 
energy economy through use of the country’s significant hydropower potential. 
 Raising quantity and value-added productivity in agriculture and fisheries, emphasizing 
the productive capacities of the poor and vulnerable. 
 Developing a national transport network for goods and people, thereby facilitating 
increased investment and economic activity. 

The Agenda for Change places emphasis on addressing gender issues as part of human 
development, including through extending women’s access to health care, education, and 
economic opportunities, as well as enhancing women’s voice in public affairs.  

19. The government has identified four preconditions for growth and development that will 
underpin the implementation of the Agenda for Change: 

 Good governance, peace, and security are explicitly acknowledged as necessary political 
underpinnings for development. Without good governance and the absence of corruption 
on one hand, and the consolidation of peace and security on the other, economic growth 
and human development will stay below potential. 
 Macroeconomic stability is acknowledged as a prerequisite for economic growth and 
private sector development as well as for poverty reduction. 
 Private sector development—including the financial sector—is seen as the engine for 
growth. Government will seek to encourage private investment in all the PRSP priority 
sectors.  
 Managing natural resources is an important priority for a nation that has seen its natural 
resources depleted (forests, minerals, fish stocks) with limited benefit to the economy or 
the people. Further prospects in extractive industries (notably oil) enhance the importance 
of this precondition for sustainable growth. 

20. Government has also identified and communicated three major risks to a successful 
development process:  

 

 Corruption, which is pervasive and drags on Sierra Leone’s development and causes poor 
external perceptions of the country. 
Illicit drugs, which are becoming a major threat to development and peace in most 
coastal states in West Africa. 
 Youth unemployment, which is acknowledged as a major development challenge as well 
as possibly the most significant risk to peace and stability. 

21. The Agenda for Change also encompasses strategies for developing the business 
environment. It focuses particularly on encouraging private sector development—through the 
removal of administrative barriers—and financial sector development—through a focus on 
access to finance and an enhanced regulatory framework. Initiatives for legal and regulatory 
reform include land reform, improvements in access to justice, and measures to attack 
corruption. The importance of capacity building is recognized in an ambitious public sector 
reform program that includes planned improvements in pay and incentives, training, and human 
resource management.  

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
22. The Agenda for Change promotes decentralization as a means to make service delivery 
more effective. Local councils are to be empowered to manage human resources, and greater 
community participation will be sought, to foster transparency and accountability.  

23. The importance of the rule of law is a theme that cuts across the Agenda for Change, 
covering business regulation, land reform, and property rights. Human rights issues are 
addressed by placing emphasis on gender parity across sectors as well as by focusing particularly 
on education for girls and on reproductive health.  

24. The Agenda for Change identifies the need to strengthen domestic revenue collection 
and limit domestic public borrowing through strengthened fiscal policy and public financial 
management—especially in the areas of domestic revenue mobilization, with the planned 
implementation of a tax reform and the implementation of a set of fiscal measures geared to 
maximize compliance and the collection efficiency of existing taxes and to broaden the tax base.  

25. The Joint IDA/IMF Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) prepared in 2009 for the Boards 
of those two organizations endorsed the government’s emphasis on good governance and 
macroeconomic stability as prerequisites for broadly based growth. The staffs of the two 
organizations commended the government’s efforts in incorporating some of the lessons learnt in 
the implementation of the PRSP-I. Nonetheless they noted that the Agenda for Change, like 
PRSP-I, appears overly ambitious, and recommended that the government further prioritize 
interventions during implementation. The JSAN concurred that the sustained distribution of 
affordable electricity, reduction of post-harvest agricultural losses, and improved road 
maintenance will make significant contributions to growth and poverty reduction. It expressed 
support for the government’s endeavors in human development, noting that the continued 
provision of health and education services on an increasingly decentralized basis will help 
improve outcomes through increased local access and accountability. The JSAN noted that 
quality in service delivery remains a challenge, notably in education where much effort is 
required to increase the number of qualified teachers, especially in deprived areas. This need for 
greater capacity was noted for other sectors also. Government’s proposals for public sector 
reform and for gradually extending performance and merit-based promotions were seen as a 
positive step. 

26. The JSAN expressed some caution about the need to maintain fiscal space to finance 
programs such as free health care for infants and lactating mothers. Regarding the critical 
need to improve domestic revenue collection to support the provision of services, the JSAN saw 
the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax as critical for improving domestic revenue 
collection. The JSAN expressed support for the adoption of the Integrated Public Financial 
Management Program to ensure the sustainability and consolidation of public financial 
management reforms. It highlighted the need for better results monitoring through planned 
improvement in statistical data collection and the development of the national M&E system.

III. 

SIERRA LEONE’S MAIN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND 
OPPORTUNITIES 

27. The Agenda for Change puts priority on human development and three growth areas 
(agriculture, energy, and transport infrastructure), along with governance, capacity development, 
private sector growth, and management of natural resources as the key underpinnings. Each of 
these areas offers opportunities but also poses challenges, which need to be taken into account if 
the Agenda is to be successfully implemented.  

A. Human Development  

28. Since the civil war, Sierra Leone has made rapid progress in human development, 
especially in education and more recently in health. Support from civil society organizations, as 
well as from the donor community, has played an important role in achieving these gains.  

29. But despite recent improvements, Sierra Leone is falling significantly short of all the 
MDGs (see Figure 3). This only partly reflects the effects of ten years of civil war—the 
country’s ratings already fell at the bottom of the HDI at the start of the war.5 Though Sierra 
Leone made efforts to protect and increase its pro-poor spending in 2001-08, primarily on health, 
education, social assistance, and safe water supply, constraints common across basic service 
sectors remain, including (a) inadequate (and undertrained) staff, equipment, and materials at the 
local service delivery points; (b) inadequate supervision of services and weak monitoring and 
evaluation of programs; and (c) low capacity to plan, budget, and respond effectively to local 
needs. The health services are particularly weak with notable governance issues in areas such as 
drug delivery.6 

5 As far back as 1988, life expectancy at birth was 42 years, the lowest rate recorded in the World Development 
Report. 
6 The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has recently produced a critical report on the Ministry of Health (leading 
to the criminal prosecution of the Minister of Health) and a somewhat less critical report on the Ministry of 
Education. Partners are paying close attention to these reports to guide their support.

* Or latest available data 

30. Health. Sierra Leone has long had the highest child and maternal mortality rates in the 
world. While there are indications that these rates are falling significantly (see Table 4), they 
remain unacceptably high. Lack of facilities within reasonable distance, lack of trained staff, and 
lack of medicines and equipment are cited as key reasons, as well as lack of affordability; 
patients are frequently charged for access to service even when the law provides for free access. 
As part of its new National Health Sector Strategic Plan the government has announced a 
program to ensure free access to health care for pregnant and lactating mothers and children 
under five. The Plan focuses on the delivery of a basic package of health services within 
reasonable distance for the whole population. Fulfilling this program, which finances drugs and 
medical consumables including insecticide-treated bed nets, medical equipment, civil works, and 
outreach campaigns, will be an administrative and financial challenge. It calls for significant 
resources as well as changes in staff incentives.

31. Malnutrition is frequent and has not declined in recent years, despite an increase in food 
production. According to the 2005 MICS-III household survey, 31 percent of Sierra Leone’s 
children less than five years old are underweight, 40 percent are stunted, and 9 percent are 
wasted. Nutrition remains an area where very little progress has been made. Similarly, access to 
clean water and acceptable sanitation remains critically low, with only 22 percent of the 
population having access to safe water supply, in spite of Sierra Leone’s favorable climate and 
high rainfall. A Water and Sanitation Policy has been developed to improve the provision of 
water supply and sanitation.  

32. Education. Rebuilding an education system after ten years of civil war has been a major 
task, including achieving the re-entry into education of a substantial part of a generation that lost 
out on schooling during the war. Government has made important strides in rebuilding its school 
system, while the backlog of students has resulted in gross enrollment rates of more than 100 
percent. Good progress has been made in raising both enrollment and completion rates at the 
primary level, with completion rates now exceeding 80 percent. The quality of education remains 
a problem, however, with limited teacher skills and frequent absenteeism, calling for efforts in 
training, capacity building, and incentives for teachers, particularly in remote areas.  

33. The number of teachers has risen significantly at all levels, with total teacher numbers 
reaching 40,262 in 2007, almost double the 2001 figure of 20,715. Primary school teacher 
numbers have not kept pace with the increase in enrollment, so the pupil/teacher ratio in primary 
schools has risen from 27 in 2001 to 44 in 2007. This rise in the ratio has been accompanied by a 
marked fall in the percentage of primary teachers who are qualified: from 79 percent to 49 
percent.7 Restoring the ratio of primary pupils to qualified teachers to its 2001 level would 
require training around 14,000 teachers, basically doubling the number already trained. 

34. Gender. To make meaningful progress towards the human development MDGs, special 
attention needs to be given to addressing the gender dimension of development, given the very 
real disparities between the sexes in health outcomes, access to education and economic 

7 The figures for secondary school teachers are much better, with pupil to teacher ratios falling from 27 to 24 while 
the percentage of qualified teachers has held up (82 percent in 2007).  

18 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
opportunities, and empowerment. Progress has been made in increasing girls’ education, with 
girls making up 47 percent of pupils enrolled in primary school.8  

35. Decentralized service delivery. An ambitious decentralization strategy has enhanced the 
delivery of basic services in health, education, and provision of clean water and sanitation, and 
remains the best means to improve on human development. Government has enacted key 
legislation to support the gradual devolution to district councils of responsibility for delivering 
basic services. The reformed intergovernmental fiscal transfer arrangements constitute an 
established system of equitable distribution of sectoral, administrative, and development grants 
allocated through transparent and objective formulas. Increasingly, the district councils directly 
influence development planning and the delivery of services, and they are continuing to broaden 
the engagement of their communities in planning and monitoring.  

36. Development outcomes have improved with decentralization, according to interviews and 
data findings from national household surveys conducted in 2005 and 2007, along with the 
annual health facility surveys conducted in connection with the IDA Institutional Reform and 
Capacity Building decentralization project. Access to, and citizens’ satisfaction with, primary 
education and health services improved between 2005 and 2007, significantly in some cases, and 
gender disparities in access to education have started to decrease, as noted above. The greatest 
improvements generally have been in the areas farthest from major towns and having the highest 
poverty ratios. The annual health facility surveys show a steady improvement in quality of 
services across health, education, and rural infrastructure. The household surveys show that 
access to schools, clinics, shared storage space, drying floors, drivable roads, market, and water 
sources has improved. Only access to agricultural extension workers has declined. Public 
satisfaction with health clinics and primary schools has also improved. In addition, studies 
suggest that areas with initially low levels of service have caught up in some sectors.  

37. More needs to be done. While the Local Government Act specifies that central 
government transfers for devolved functions are to be sufficient to enable service delivery at an 
acceptable standard, in practice the transfers have often fallen short of the budgeted amounts and 
have been late and insufficient. The roles of various levels of administration are not well defined. 
Some ministries and agencies, most notably those responsible for education and roads, have not 
devolved functions as and when required. Strengthening the capacity of the local councils to 
plan, manage, and deliver services will be crucial for improving human development outcomes.  

38. Capacity constraints are found in all aspects of Sierra Leone’s public sector 
management and service delivery. The health sector suffers from a shortage of personnel and a 
lack of sufficient qualifications and motivation among staff. Similarly, lack of qualifications and 
absenteeism are recurrent problems in education. Key accountability institutions such as 
Parliament and the Anti-Corruption Commission lack enough resources and qualified staff to do 
their jobs well. The civil service lacks qualified staff in technical mid-level positions, while 
being burdened by under-qualified staff in large numbers. Levels of compensation are low at all 
levels. A Public Sector Reform Program for 2009-13 has been published. This provides for a 
recalibration of the civil service, measures to hire and retain qualified personnel in health and 
education, a pay reform, and a retrenchment in certain functions. Development partners, which 
have relied heavily on their own mechanisms for delivery of support, including nongovernmental 

8 At the secondary level, girls account for 41 percent of the students enrolled.  

19 

 
                                                 
organizations and project implementation units, need to take bold steps toward strengthening the 
country’s own ability to deliver.  

B. Inclusive Growth 

39. The robust growth since the end of the civil war partly reflects the resumption of 
peacetime conditions as normal economic activity was reinitiated and displaced persons 
returned. As these catch-up gains have been consolidated, the pace of growth, while still robust, 
has started to taper off. To reach the 10 percent annual growth rates that are envisaged in the 
Agenda for Change, with the associated fall in poverty rates, major investments are needed in 
agriculture, roads, and energy in particular. Realizing new investment opportunities in the 
mining sector (iron, bauxite, rutile) and possibilities for establishing growth poles around those 
investments, is also key, as is improving the working conditions in the fishing industry. Private-
sector working conditions must continue to build on the gains that Sierra Leone has recently 
made in the Doing Business ratings, moving up more than 20 places in three years. In particular, 
governance—including public sector effectiveness and battling corruption—must significantly 
improve and be seen to improve. In that light, Sierra Leone’s recent improved ratings in the Mo 
Ibrahim Index of African Governance and the Transparency International Index of Corruption 
Perceptions are encouraging. 

40. Agriculture and fisheries. Sierra Leone has very strong comparative advantage in its vast 
natural resources and favorable climate (see Figure 5). The ecosystem comprises forests, savanna 
woodlands, freshwater and wetlands, and marine resources. Agriculture (including fishing, 
livestock, processing, and logistical support) accounts for about 55 percent of GDP and employs 
two-thirds of the population. Sierra Leone has substantial potential for sustainable production of 
cash crops (natural rubber, oil palm, cocoa), food crops (cassava, rice, grains), and fishing. 
Cassava and rice constitute the main crops. Agriculture supplies a rising share of total export 
revenues, mainly from cocoa (Figure 4).

41. Most of Sierra Leone’s agriculture is at the subsistence level. Opportunities in 
commercial agriculture have not been fully realized, due to multiple constraints: low levels of 
investment; land access issues; the inefficient small size of land holdings; regional and seasonal 
labor shortages; lack of effective institutional arrangements for agricultural credit; inadequate 
support for research, technology generation, and extension services; the poor transport network 
and facilities; inadequate agroprocessing capacity and high post-harvest losses; and uncontrolled 
fishing and logging. The capacity of ministries, departments, and agencies responsible for 
developing supportive policies and programs is weak. 

42. To attain objectives in food security calls for a multi-faceted approach. Interventions are 
needed to promote greater private sector participation in the provision of agricultural inputs, 
equipment, and extension services; transformation of the land tenure system; support for tree 
crops and diversification of food sources outside of rice; and a stronger role for rural credit and 
micro-credit programs in improving agricultural productivity. Sierra Leone has been active in the 
Africa Union Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Plan (CAADP) approach, and is 
own National Sustainable Agriculture Development Plan is fully aligned with the CAADP. 
Government has committed to fulfill the Maputo Pledge of allocating at least 10 percent of the 
budget to the agricultural sector and to seek to achieve an annual growth rate of 6 percent in 
agriculture, from the 2 to 3 percent of recent years. It is hoped that agriculture may play a 
significant role in helping solve the youth unemployment problem. Efforts are being piloted to 
help relocate young families from Freetown and other cities and from mining back to villages 
and agriculture. Significant training, financial help, and guidance will be needed to make these 
efforts work.  

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5: Sierra Leone has abundant potential for agriculture 

43. The fisheries sector provides significant food for the nation and a livelihood for up to 
500,000 people. It has significant potential as an export industry, given the good ocean resources 
of high value species. Removing barriers for fish exports to Europe, through improved quality 
measures and ability to certify origin, remains key. To realize this potential on a sustainable 
basis, major investments are needed in processing facilities, quality control, and resource 
management, including better surveillance and sustainable, transparent, allocation of access.  

44. Energy. A fundamental constraint on job creation and poverty reduction in Sierra Leone 
is the country’s limited supply of electric power. Production by the National Power Authority 
(NPA) declined from 14 MW in 2002 to 3.7 MW in 2006 and collapsed completely in 2007, 
before a return to 15 MW was achieved through an expensive emergency program. Deep-rooted 
problems at NPA include inadequate maintenance, technical and nontechnical losses9, under-
investment, vandalism, overstaffing, and a tariff structure that does not automatically adjust for 
changes in fuel costs. In late 2009 power from the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Plant became 
available. The 50MW of hydroelectric power together with new and existing heavy fuel oil 
generation capacity will bring Sierra Leone’s total generation capacity to 74MW in early 2010. 
Distribution capacity will remain below the generation capacity at first, but investments already 
under way will increase availability in Freetown and some towns along the Bumbuna 
transmission route. 

45. Government has launched a new energy sector strategy based on public and private 
investments, regional integration, and policy reforms. Based mainly on hydropower, including 
mini-hydro, a significant increase in electricity access both urban and rural is planned. 

9 As much as 40 percent of the energy generated in recent years was not paid for. 

22 

 
 
 
                                                 
Institutional and policy reforms will include a systemic effort to strengthen the financial viability 
of the NPA through reducing its operational costs, adjusting tariffs, and unbundling the sector so 
as to separate generation, transmission, and distribution. In the longer term, the government 
plans to further develop hydroelectric generation, which together with an augmentation of 
capacity at Bumbuna could contribute more than 200MW of power. It also plans to join the West 
African Power Pool (WAPP) (see Box 2). Government estimates that Sierra Leone’s current 
demand is 400MW. Only a small proportion of this is connected to the current distribution 
system. The scale of the government’s investment plans calls for very significant financial 
resources10, most of which may need to come from private investors for whom the link to the 
WAPP and/or secure sales to major customers, such as mining companies, may be a prerequisite.  

46. A good transport network is critical for growth in key sectors of the economy and for 
meeting the MDGs. Maintenance of the existing network of roads, air, and sea transport has been 
essentially neglected since the war. Poorly maintained rural and feeder roads connecting villages 
and farm areas to market centers, and the lack of regular transport services, pose serious 
challenges to the country’s development. The rehabilitation of approximately 160 km of roads in 
the major provincial towns and 2,055 km of feeder roads, as well as the construction of highways 
between the urban centers, is a priority of government, particularly to develop agribusiness. The 
core network of more than 4,000 km (which includes A and B roads) is being rehabilitated with 
support from donors. Procurement issues and poor contract management in civil works have 
slowed the rehabilitation of the road sector. Road maintenance will be undertaken by government 
through the Road Maintenance Fund, an institution that has been until recently plagued by 
governance problems which are now expected to improve afterGovernment  recently approved 
enhancements in its independence. . Steps are being initiated to provide greater opportunities for 
small local firms to participate in maintenance contracts, so as to increase the labor intensity of 
this work and provide job opportunities. 

47. Beyond the road sector, improvements are needed in the facilities at the international 
airport and, notably, the connection between the airport and Freetown, calling for road 
construction and much improved marine connections. Governance issues also affect airport and 
seaport agencies, where gaps in senior management persist. Opportunities for private 
participation in transport will likely be limited to areas with defined demand, such as the airport 
transfer and key roads.  

10 Approximately US$ 1 billion would be required to complete the connections to the WAPP, build the proposed 
Bumbuna II hydroelectric facility, and carry out programmed improvements in distribution and thermal generation.

Box 2: Regional integration 

Sierra Leone is located in the volatile Mano River Union region (Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone). 
Regional stability is an important challenge for Sierra Leone, as unrest has frequently spilled across borders in the 
sub-region.  

Underpinning growth in agriculture, energy, and transport. Sierra Leone is a member of the African Union and of 
ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), which was established in 1975 and is an increasingly 
important forum for discussion of common sub-regional issues. However, sub-regional cooperation has not 
developed to its full potential. Member states of the ECOWAS commission including Sierra Leone are working to 
strengthen macroeconomic surveillance and harmonize the statistical and reporting systems in the sub-region as well 
as to adopt the same currency.  

Potential benefits from regional integrations are seen to include: 

Market size and access. Regional economic integration may help overcome the constraints associated with the small 
size of the domestic market, in particular for the export of agricultural products. 

Competitive infrastructure services: Sierra Leone has potential for significant hydroelectric generation (estimated at 
1.2GW). Through joining the West Africa Power Pool, Sierra Leone may be both an importer and exporter of 
electricity to smooth the development of its national capacity and compensate for seasonal variations in 
hydroelectric generation. At present Sierra Leone’s sole broadband connection is to the SAT-3 fiber-optic cable via 
a microwave link to Guinea. It is anticipated that additional regional broadband connections may soon become 
available.  

Provision of public goods. Collaboration with neighboring countries in managing regional commons can unlock 
growth opportunities (shared resources such as the Mano River, fisheries, mining, knowledge sharing and 
dissemination of best practice for agriculture and vocational training and industry platforms) and reduce 
vulnerability (diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS and common challenges from climate change).  

The JAS will support Sierra Leone’s participation in regional initiatives that can leverage its national efforts to 
tackle sectoral constraints on economic growth. In so doing, special attention will be paid to the alignment between 
regional interventions and national actions.  

C. Good Governance and Capacity Building 

48. The quality of governance—both real and perceived—remains a key challenge for 
Sierra Leone. Given the country’s political history of clientelism and patronage, governance 
improvements including effective anti-corruption measures are essential for achieving the better 
services and economic growth that are envisaged in the Agenda for Change and for preserving 
social peace. Comparison of Sierra Leone’s governance indicators with those of other African 
countries reveals a mixed picture (see Figure 6). Sierra Leone does well on political stability and 
on voice and accountability, in itself a major achievement for a post-conflict country. But it lags 
well behind on other indicators, and most of all on government effectiveness and on control of 
corruption. This mixture of attributes suggests that the government is right to emphasize private 
sector development and decentralization as pillars for development, making good use of the 
political stability and strong demand for accountability while limiting the demands on limited 
government capacity.

49. The low government effectiveness ratings reflect a civil service that suffers from weak 
administrative and technical capacity, with a missing professional middle and large numbers 
of unskilled workers. The low ratings also reflect a legacy of politicization, which links 
effectiveness to control of corruption. Improvements have taken place in recent years, notably in 
public financial management, with the introduction of financial management systems and the 
rollout of procurement legislation and procedures; these are recognized by public expenditure 
and financial accountability (PEFA) and public expenditure review (PER) assessments that show 
Sierra Leone leapfrogging many countries. But weaknesses are pervasive and improvements in 
government effectiveness will depend on significant capacity building, public sector reform 
including re-calibration of the civil service, and stronger measures to control corruption.  

50. Government has embarked energetically on initiatives to address governance, including 
strengthening the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in law and staff. The ACC has already 
made some notable decisions, including indictments of ministers for corruption, and has 
published critical governance reviews of key ministries. The President, ministers, members of 
Parliament, and senior civil servants are now required to declare their assets to the ACC. The 
audited public accounts are now up to date and have been made public. The government has 
endorsed a bill to increase the independence of the road maintenance fund, which should result in 
more transparency and checks and balances in road sector spending. And a Freedom of 
Information bill has been tabled in Parliament, to significantly improve access to information and 
to remove limitations on freedom of expression, notably in the press. Reflecting this progress, 
the 2009 Transparency International tables on corruption perception placed Sierra Leone 146th 
of 180 countries surveyed—an improvement of twelve places over 2008. As noted above, the 
broader Mo Ibrahim Index shows a similar improvement. There is still a need for deeper reforms 
to sustain and improve on these gains (see Box 3).  

51. An opportunity exists to build upon Sierra Leone’s political openness and stability to 
make better use of Parliamentary oversight for greater transparency in governance. The recent 
25 

 
 
 
 
trend, reflected in the country’s 1991 Constitution, is for increased concentration of power and 
resources within the executive branch of government. And Parliament’s ability to contribute 
actively to the legislative process is further impaired by parliamentarians’ shortages of resources 
and training. But even within the existing constitutional framework, there may be an opportunity 
to increase Parliament’s effectiveness by providing resources for research and for committees, as 
well as training programs for members. Development partners have begun a series of workshops 
to inform parliamentarians about reform initiatives that are at early stages of preparation, and this 
has proved effective in raising awareness and understanding of proposed legislation. 

52. Sierra Leone’s articulate civil society has been active in drafting the Freedom of 
Information Bill and is vocal in publicizing identified abuses of office. To build upon this 
strong demand for good governance and service delivery, it is expected that all development 
projects will be subject to the publication of all information consistent with the Freedom of 
Information Bill, along with oversight by civil society/non-state actors. This was the process 
followed in the new Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project and the 
Decentralized Service Delivery Project, and also in the development of a network of community 
paralegals as part of the Justice for the Poor program (supported with World Bank-funded 
technical assistance). As noted earlier, Sierra Leone is a candidate for validation under the 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which will support greater transparency in 
natural resource management, including civil society participation. More efforts are needed to 
support civil society in its efforts to develop accountability mechanisms in other spheres of 
economic activity. 

26 

 
 
 
Box 3: Governance indicators and CPIA as guide for governance improvements 

Sierra Leone’s governance weaknesses seriously influence the implementation of government services and 
investment projects, and the country’s ability to attract sorely needed external and domestic investments. While 
progress on a broad front in recent years is beginning to be reflected in various international ratings, including the 
Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, the Index of African Governance, and the World Bank 
Doing Business ratings, governance and corruption perceptions ratings remain low.  

The low governance ratings also have a big impact on the level of ADF and IDA funding. The country has leveled 
off in CPIA ratings at just above 3 against a maximum of 6 and slightly below the average for IDA countries in Sub-
Saharan Africa. The governance ratings make up the lowest part of these ratings. Given the high weight of 
governance in the allocation formulas, Sierra Leone's low governance score translates into low ADF and IDA 
allocations. 

GoSL has acknowledged the importance of improving its CPIA ratings and has engaged the World Bank to help 
achieve this, based on the assumption that these ratings are a good proxy for key improvements in policy. Four 
notably weak areas depress the overall ratings: (1) policies and institutions for environmental sustainability; (2) 
property rights and rule-based governance; (3) efficiency of revenue mobilization; and (4) transparency, 
accountability, and corruption in the public sector. Areas that need improvement and certain activities that, if 
implemented, would lead to better policies and public sector management, and subsequently to higher CPIA ratings, 
have been identified. Government has taken steps to improve performance in each of these areas. The relatively 
good ratings in other areas such as macroeconomic management, fiscal policy, debt policy, and trade show the levels 
attainable even under the current capacity constraints. While the ratings are still moderate, recent improvements in 
the business regulatory environment show that progress can be achieved in a relatively short period.  

53. 
Increasing effectiveness. Key elements of a program for improved government 
effectiveness and good governance include (a) public service reform aimed at achieving better 
service delivery 
through 
improving personnel management and 
remuneration; 
(b) 
decentralization of services delivery; (c) improvements in public financial management; (d) 
strengthening the anti-corruption agenda; (e) civil society monitoring and accountability 
mobilization; (f) an enhanced capacity for Parliament for the consideration of legislation; and (g) 
better statistics for monitoring outcomes. In making governance an overarching theme for all of 
the JAS, the JAS partners are encouraging staff and development partners to carry out analyses 
of vulnerability in all sectors as well as in all projects. Among the focus areas for improved 
governance and effectiveness are: 

 Decentralization. Although devolution is still in its early stages, with the spending 
autonomy of local councils still very constrained by central government and with 
government staff largely on the central government payroll, there are already clear 
indications that services are improving and that the public is happier with a local delivery 
mode. For example, the 2008 Decentralization Survey points to better development 
results in districts where services have been decentralized. Devolution of power and 
influence to the local level, including local councils and chiefdoms, is one way to 
counteract a history of alienation and patronage that is widely seen to have contributed to 
the conditions that led to the civil war. Wherever possible, programs should make 
resources available to local councils in a way that strengthens and supports the existing 
grant system and the capacity of local councils to deliver services. 

27 

 
 
 
 Public sector reform. Salary reform is a necessary further step in improving the 
efficiency of the civil service, which is skewed toward unskilled staff, who provide little 
value added, and very short on technical staff. Salary levels are too low to attract people 
with other options and they contribute to lack of efficiency and unwanted behavior 
among civil servants. A census of staff in certain positions has also helped provide better 
control of costs. The government’s recently published Public Sector Reform Program 
2009-13 aims to change the composition of the civil service, link pay to performance, 
attract qualified persons to key positions, and increase transparency and accountability.  

 Public financial management. Limited budget credibility and predictability, weaknesses 
in expenditure control (including payroll), and low levels of transparency have 
undermined the reform process in Sierra Leone. Government has begun a comprehensive 
program for public financial management reform. Modern budgeting and accounting 
systems have been introduced and new and better budgeting legislation and regulations 
are in place. Most ministries and agencies now prepare annual procurement plans. 
Government has adopted a new Chart of Accounts and requires donors to use it for 
regular reporting. Other program initiatives include auditable verification of payroll 
management, resulting in a validated personnel record for all teachers; reconciliation of 
bank balances against payments and transfers to and from ministries, departments, and 
agencies (MDAs); introduction of procurement plans for public entities; and an increased 
portion of procurements to be allocated through open competition. Government is to seek 
to ensure that the composition of spending becomes more stable and that the financial 
flows to key sectors such as local councils become more predictable. Government will 
also ensure that the number of internal audit units in MDAs is increased. 

 Capacity building. To deliver on the Agenda for Change, the government and partners 
will pursue a comprehensive and sustained approach to building capacity, through a 
national capacity building program. This will need to address salary structures and results 
links, return programs for the diaspora, training and skills enhancement, and incentives 
for work in rural areas. JAS partners are already engaged through public financial 
management support and, recently, through initiatives to phase out their reliance on 
project implementation units (PIUs) and to integrate staff hired on special terms into the 
civil service. Their ongoing development policy lending has played a key role in 
advancing policy reforms in this area. During the JAS period specific capacity building 
programs, offered by WBI and others, will also be called on. 

 

 The importance of donor harmonization. Development partners have made extensive 
use of PIUs and provided capacity building support only in piecemeal fashion. Recent 
agreements reached between the government and development partners, confirmed at the 
recent CG meeting, commit the partners to significantly scale up their capacity building 
efforts and to harmonize the delivery of their assistance, in line with the Paris and Accra 
commitments. 

 Effective management of natural resources and the environment. Sierra Leone has 
significant natural resources both renewable and nonrenewable, many of which are 
attractive to private sector utilization. The nonrenewable are mainly minerals, of which 
diamonds are the best known. Mining has already created significant environmental and 

28 

 
social challenges. The prospect of oil offshore creates optimism but also fears of 
economic, environmental, and social risks. Sierra Leone’s forest cover has been largely 
lost, but a few key areas remain. The Gola Forest near the Liberian border is a high-
quality rain forest being preserved as a national park. Similarly, with IDA/GEF support, a 
new national park, Loma Mountains, is being created, with West Africa’s highest 
mountain, Bintumani, and the country’s largest chimpanzee population. Fish resources 
are significant but under threat. While Government has taken positive steps, including 
embarking upon the process for EITI validation and establishing a secretariat, formally 
assigning responsibility for environmental governance to the Sierra Leone Environmental 
Protection Agencies and, more recently, establishing an Office of Fisheries Management 
at the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources, staffing and empowering these bodies 
will be a prerequisite for effectiveness.  

D. Job Creation and Private Sector Development 

54. Youth unemployment is a daunting challenge, which ultimately must be solved mainly 
through private sector growth, supported by a number of public activities. Young people in 
Sierra Leone face numerous difficulties in finding remunerative work.11 Up to 800,000 people 
between 15 and 35 are unemployed, employed without secure wages, or seriously 
underemployed. The overall skill level of young people is low. Thirty-five percent of 15-to-24-
year olds and 63 percent of 25-to-35-year olds have never attended school. Among both age 
groups, only 20 percent have finished primary school. Inactivity rates in the labor market are 
high, especially in urban areas. Many young people are not in school, not working, and not 
looking for employment. (See Box 4.)  

55. To address these challenges, the government has created a Youth Commission reporting 
to the Office of the President. Four areas of focus have been identified. The most important of 
these is to promote private sector growth to create demand for labor; the emphasis on private 
sector growth in the Agenda for Change reflects this priority. The second focus is on skills 
development, not least through vocational training activities and various forms of apprenticeship. 
The third is to provide relief through public works programs. The final one is to encourage and 
support the voluntary relocation of youth from urban to rural areas and their reintroduction to 
agriculture. The JAS partners, in cooperation with UNDP and Germany, are preparing a program 
and will be seeking support from other partners. In doing so, measures to encourage job creation 
by the private sector will be key. Indeed, the Agenda for Change reflects the government’s 
recognition that economic transformation requires vibrant private sector enterprise. Foreign 
investment will be required, to bring in the technologies and market connections that will be 
needed to realize the potential of Sierra Leone’s natural endowment. In a major Trade and 
Investment Conference held in London in November 2009, the government presented its private 
sector program and reached out to prospective international investors, notably in agriculture, 
fisheries, energy, tourism, and mineral resources. 

56. 
In recent years Sierra Leone has substantially reformed its policies affecting the private 
sector, as evidenced by significant improvements in the international “Doing Business”

Opportunities in a Post-Conflict Setting (Washington, DC: World Bank), 2009, based on data from the Sierra Leone 
Integrated Household Survey 2003 and the Statistics Sierra Leone Census 2004.

ratings. It has implemented a number of policy measures, largely guided by the “Doing 
Business” program, to provide a conducive business environment, including coordination of 
trade policy formulation and implementation, legislation to simplify business procedures, a 
restructuring and strengthening of the export development and investment promotion agency, 
and the development of a privatization strategy by the National Commission for Privatization 
(NCP). The government has also commissioned a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS), 
now under way; an Administrative Barriers to Trade and Investments Study, also ongoing, to 
address all administrative impediments to investment in Sierra Leone; and a Financial Sector 
Assessment Program, which shaped the Financial Sector Development Plan that the Cabinet 
endorsed in June 2009.  

57. Formalization of the local private sector must be a focus to grow the economy and 
increase government revenues from taxes. Most of the country’s locally owned businesses are 
in the informal sector. Efforts to strengthen them still face particular challenges in the area of 
land rights; without formal rights to land it is difficult to use land property as collateral to raise 
funds, or for the commercialization of agriculture and manufacturing industries. In the Agenda 
for Change, Government has indicated its intention to enact a Law on Commercial Use of Land, 

carry out cadastral mapping, strengthen titling systems, and foster formalizing property rights.  

58. 
 Various recent studies12 have identified access to finance as the binding constraint on 
growth in Sierra Leone. The financial sector remains nascent and dominated by the banking 
sector, with 13 banks. Private sector credit at 5.5 percent of GDP is well below the Sub-Saharan 
average of 17 percent. The system has been growing rapidly, reflecting the entry of new 
participants but also reduced competition from treasury bills. During 2008, loans and advances 
grew by 62 percent and deposits by 37 percent. Access to finance remains the largest challenge, 
with fewer than 5 percent of the population having a bank account and far fewer having loans.

Box 4: Mining and youth employment 

Youth employment is particularly vulnerable to current declines in commodity prices. Despite these recent 
declines, mining remains Sierra Leone’s second most important sector in employment, after agriculture, 
providing low skills employment, mostly for young men. Mining also is the largest source of export income, 
although the historic dominance of diamonds is being partly supplanted by rutile, bauxite and, prospectively, 
iron ore and gold. While the number is difficult to assess, mining and quarrying may employ as much as 14 
percent of the total labor force, directly or indirectly.  

With the drop in mining activity and drop in diamond prices due to the global crisis, the associated downward 
pressure on youth employment has become more apparent. The resulting increase in poverty in mining areas 
and the subsequent risks of unrest are of significant concern to GoSL. IDA is engaged in mitigating these risks 
through the cash for work and community-driven development aspects of the National Social Action Project, 
which include investments in turning old diamond pits into agricultural land again, and through the matching 
grants scheme under the Rural Private Sector Development Project, which helps small investors to leverage 
savings toward investments through the agricultural value chain. 

Public revenues from mining remain modest at approximately US$10.5 million a year and are comprised 
primarily of license fees. It is estimated that, with comprehensive reforms, mining exports could rise to US$1.2 
billion by 2020. If the extraction of the oil discoveries that were confirmed in late 2009 turns out to be feasible, 
natural resource incomes may get an additional boost, if reasonably handled. Government has applied for 
validation under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) which seeks to promote good practices 
in the management of mining revenues. Once this is achieved, Government wishes to extend this engagement to 
EITI++ which also covers the allocation of mining licenses and the utilization of mining royalty revenue.  

Despite the abundant resources, without new investment Sierra Leone’s revenues from mining may decline by 
up to 70 percent within ten years. Problems in the mining sector include (a) weak mineral development 
agreements that do not yield revenues commensurate with potential; (b) poor regulatory enforcement impeding 
sector growth; (c) very limited impact of mining activities on economic development in the country, (d) 
inadequate environmental protection, and (e) inadequate arrangements to ensure that mining operations are 
accountable to local communities. IDA is providing technical assistance to help improve the governance of the 
mining sector. This includes a major Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment of the mining sector and 
mining communities and a new TA project–Mining Sector Technical Assistance–to improve capacity in the 
Mining Directorate and legal and regulatory reform. 

IV. 

RESULTS AND LESSONS FROM PAST IDA/IFC/AFDB ASSISTANCE 

A. World Bank Client Survey  

59. The 2009 national client survey13 conducted by the World Bank in Sierra Leone indicates 
that governance and government effectiveness are identified by a huge plurality as the top 
development priority. This marks a shift in views since the previous such survey was conducted 
in FY05when stakeholders focused on infrastructure, agriculture, and education as their key 
priorities.; A plurality of stakeholders believes now that the Bank’s emphasis should be in 
governance and government effectiveness, followed by agriculture and only 10 percent said the 
World Bank should emphasize infrastructure––approximately the same percentage who said that 
it should emphasize foreign direct investment. This shift is noteworthy, particularly in an 
environment in which governance is a top focus of the World Bank. Implementation Lessons 
from World Bank Group CAS and CSP, 2005-09  

13 A questionnaire was sent to 700 individuals, of whom 365 responded. See Appendix 15. 

31 

 
 
                                                 
60. During the implementation of the World Bank Group’s last country assistance strategy 
(FY06–09) ) and the country strategy paper (2005–09), Sierra Leone made substantial 
achievements 
in decentralization, capacity building, and 
improving public financial 
management that provided a foundation for improving service delivery. The country made 
moderate progress in improving the regulatory framework to improve the business environment 
and enable growth in the private sector. IDA support to basic services in health, education, and 
HIV/AIDs achieved moderate results, including universal access to education and rehabilitation 
of health facilities. In addition, IDA support helped achieve good progress in integrating 
vulnerable populations through community development initiatives and income-generating 
activities. On the other hand, progress was slow in (a) improving infrastructure services, 
particularly access to electricity and usability of road networks; (b) improving agricultural 
capacity; and (c) managing the mining sector.  

61. The last CAS provides the following key lessons learned for the implementation of the 
JAS: 

What worked well: 

 The World Bank’s support to the public financial management system has been effective. 
The support provided a solid platform in the system that supports fiscal discipline, 
effective allocation of money, and improved predictability.  

 The World Bank’s contribution improved decentralization and capacity building within 
local governments and provided a foundation for service delivery. Decentralization 
stimulated reforms in public financial management. 

 Community-based approaches to integrate vulnerable populations into income-generating 
activities have been effective.  

What worked less well: 

 Less progress was made in improving governance issues in infrastructure, particularly in 
energy, transport, and water. Lack of progress remains a key impediment to a better 
investment climate and to delivery of basic social services. Entrenched vested interests 
made governance reforms in these sectors complicated. 

 The election period and change of government during the CAS period delayed CAS 
implementation more than had been envisaged.  

 Complex, unrealistic project designs and low institutional capacity led to poor 
performance and delays in implementation. Sierra Leone’s state setting is still limited and 
fragile and this needs to be taken into account. 

32 

 
 
 
B. IDA Portfolio Performance 

62. The quality of the IDA portfolio has been mixed. During the CAS period, Sierra Leone’s 
IDA portfolio grew and matured. However, its quality deteriorated, and the proportion of 
projects at risk includes four of the eleven IDA projects. The four projects rated as problem 
projects are the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Environmental and Social Management Specific 
Investment Loan (SIL), the Infrastructure Development Project, the Power and Water SIL, and 
the Rural and Private Sector Development SIL. Problems include lack of counterpart funding, 
weak monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems, procurement issues, and slow disbursement. 
The Bumbuna Hydroelectric Environmental and Social Management SIL and the Power and 
Water SIL both suffered from weak capacity within the designated ministries and agencies. This 
lack of capacity resulted in a lack of coordination in implementation of project components. The 
Rural Private Sector Development SIL only became effective more than one year after its 
approval, and has now been restructured. Overall, nearly 55% of the portfolio has been disbursed 
and over the past three years, disbursement ratios in Sierra Leone have ranged between 20 and 
26 percent, slightly above regional averages.  

63. Based on consultation with the World Bank task team and government, a review of 
Sierra Leone’s Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) for FY08 identified six factors 
that affected implementation and results: (a) ambitious and complex project design, (b) lack of 
leadership and ownership within the implementing agencies, (c) low institutional capacity in 
PIUs and line ministries, (d) inadequate monitoring and evaluation, (e) lack of timely availability 
of counterpart funds, and (f) excessive use of highly paid international consultants. Although 
various projects appear to be well designed and their resources well aligned to areas of need, 
their sustainability remains questionable given the country’s shortages of human and capital 
resources. Implementation constraints (mainly in financial management, with delays in 
procurement and submission of withdrawal applications) have created substantial delays in 
disbursement. The World Bank actively addressed the key CPPR findings with Sierra Leone’s 
new government and administration staff in 2008.  

64. QAG assessments of the portfolio during FY06–09. The World Bank’s Quality Assurance 
Group (QAG) assessed two projects for quality at entry; one of these was rated satisfactory and 
the other marginally satisfactory. One project was reviewed in a quality of supervision 
assessment and found to be highly satisfactory, while of two projects assessed for the quality of 
the lending portfolio, the Power and Water Project was rated moderately unsatisfactory. Where 
QAG found the projects less than fully satisfactory, the identified shortcomings were largely that 
the projects were too complex or that insufficient staffing had been provided for a post-conflict 
environment.  

65. 
IEG evaluations of ICRs. During the CAS period, four IDA projects were closed. 
Implementation completion reports (ICRs) were prepared for all four and were reviewed by the 
World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). Appendix 3 presents the results of the 
completed ICRs and the IEG ratings. Overall, the project ratings were mixed, with one 
satisfactory, two moderately satisfactory, and one moderately unsatisfactory rating. IEG 
indicated that (a) project design needs to be tailored to country context, and (b) when a project is 
restructured in a post-conflict country, the project objectives need to be redefined to reflect what 
33 

 
 
can be achieved. Moreover, a realistic timetable to implement sector reforms needs to be 
developed, taking into account the current country situation and local capacity constraints.  

66. The measures IDA has adopted to address the identified shortcomings include: 

 Restructuring projects (the Rural PSD, the Power and Water, and the Bumbuna 
Hydroelectric projects have all been identified for restructuring). 

 Designing new projects to be less complex and simpler to implement. 

 

Increasingly decentralizing IDA’s project staff to Freetown (or sometimes to Accra). 

 Financing 100 percent of project expenditures. 

 Taking steps to enhance the project dialogue with Government to ensure greater 
understanding and ownership. 

 Providing training programs in procurement and financial management. 

 Taking steps to integrate project implementation units in government agencies. 

C. Areas of Existing Intermediation by IFC 

67. 
IFC’s support has centered on providing advisory services to strengthen the enabling 
environment and business promotion. The advice supports the removal of administrative 
barriers to investment, in partnership with DfID, and specific reforms of the business-enabling 
environment. The latter include reforms to facilitate starting new businesses and registering 
property, as well as capacity building for exporters through the Sierra Leone Investment and 
Export Promotion Agency (SLIEPA) program. 

68. 
IFC has supported the broadening of access to microfinance through a committed equity 
investment in ProCredit Sierra Leone, and initial steps to develop a leasing framework along 
with financial institutions to implement it. Agriculture players of all sizes would benefit from 
access to leasing. IFC has provided trade credit lines to three banks (Sierra Leone Commercial 
Bank, Rokel Commercial Bank, and Guaranty Trust Bank). The credit lines are being used, in 
part, to import goods and equipment for agribusiness. IFC is looking to expand and diversify its 
trade finance lines. 

D. AfDB Country Strategy Paper 2005–09: Implementation Results  

69. The overriding objective of AfDB’s 2005-09 Country Strategy Paper (CSP) was to assist 
Government to maintain sound macroeconomic stability and implement the governance 
measures. The AfDB strategy has been relevant and consistent with the country’s objectives and 
post-conflict agenda. Overall, progress and achievements have been realized since the Bank 
established its field office in Sierra Leone in 2007. The mid-term review completed in 2008 cited 

34 

 
 
moderate progress under both pillar 1 and pillar 2 of the strategy, pillar 1 being to enhance 
economic growth through improved governance and pillar 2 being to develop human resources.  

70. Some aspects of AfDB’s support succeeded better than others. Support to public financial 
management through the Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Program III was relatively 
effective, as it provided a good framework for fiscal discipline and effective budget execution. 
Support for strengthening district health services succeeded relatively well, as did the regional 
Mano River HIV/AIDS Project l. Progress in governance arrangements in the energy sector 
(Bumbuna) has been slow, however, and efforts to help the government boost agricultural 
productivity have not succeeded.  

71. At the end of the third quarter of 2009 there were eleven ongoing projects in the AfDB 
portfolio. These are at different stages of implementation with a total approved amount of UA 
95.78 million. Out of the approved amount, a total of UA 43.568 million has been disbursed. The 
social sector accounts for UA 45.0m, Agriculture UA 24.85m, Infrastructure UA 13.14m, and 
Multi-sector UA 12.79m. Within the social sector,  Health accounts for 37.7 percent, Education 
35.5 percent, and Community Social Services Support 26.7 percent. Within Infrastructure, the 
Power sub-sector contributes a significant amount of 78.4 percent, followed by Transport with 
15.1 percent, and Water and Sanitation with 6.5 percent.  

72. The average size of projects in the AfDB portfolio is UA 8.58m. This compares with 
IDA’s average project size of UA 16.9 million, on average, in 2007, up from about UA 15 
million in 2006. 

73. Portfolio performance. Portfolio implementation has been affected by long time lags 
between project design and implementation, the bureaucratic processing procedures of line 
ministries, the limited capacity and skills of PIU staff, lack of implementation oversight and 
project monitoring by government, delays in releasing government counterpart funding, delays in 
conducting project audits and submission of progress reports, long delays in granting “No 
Objections,” inadequate project supervision, and turnover of task managers. 

74. The low disbursement rate of only 45.5 percent is a serious impediment to project 
effectiveness and is indicative of poor portfolio performance.14 Overall, 54 percent of AfDB’s 
Sierra Leone portfolio is at risk.15 This is a high proportion, but it represents an improvement 
over 2007 and 2008 (with 83.3 percent and 75 percent respectively at risk). The 54 percent of 
projects at risk as of 1st October 2009 was composed 18 percent of problem projects and 36 
percent of potential problematic projects, not including regional projects.  

75. 
 The establishment of the AfDB office in Sierra Leone has helped to improve the overall 
management of the portfolio, as well as the visibility of AfDB, by facilitating workshops, 
consultations, dialogue, monitoring and follow-up of activities and programs. Access to the 
enhanced resources of the Fragile States Facility, and the flexibility embodied in this facility, 
have helped in addressing some of the delays in project implementation mentioned earlier. 
Another lesson is the importance of enhancing government monitoring and evaluation 

14 The 45.5 percent disbursement for AfDB projects represents cumulative disbursement while the 20 to 26 percent 
disbursement cited above for IDA projects represents the annual disbursement.  
15 PAR is measured as the ratio of the number of projects at risk to the total number of rated operations. 

35 

 
                                                 
mechanisms to ensure effective and efficient use of resources. It is only through recent dialogue 
that the government has put in place mechanisms for project monitoring and evaluation.  

76. Based on some lessons learnt, AfDB is taking measures to further improve portfolio 
performance. These include: 

 Facilitating project coordination activities with the government/PIUs on a regular 
quarterly basis. 

 Providing technical and management support to PIUs in dealing with implementation 
challenges. 

 Developing a detailed country portfolio improvement plan with Government to form an 
action plan. 

 Working through the targeted support of the Fragile States Facility to address capacity 
constraints in Sierra Leone, and continuing the dialogue with Government and other 
development partners to support capacity building. 

 

Improving projects’ design and quality at entry. 

V. 

WORLD BANK GROUP AND AFDB GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY TO 
SUPPORT THE AGENDA FOR CHANGE 

77. The implementation of the Agenda for Change will determine whether Sierra Leone can 
achieve a high-returns trajectory of economic and social investments. Peace, stability, prudent 
economic management, and natural potential in key sectors such as agriculture, mining, and 
tourism, provide reasons for optimism, while weaknesses in governance, lack of capacity, low 
human development indicators, and risks of regional turmoil exemplify hurdles to be overcome. 
The JAS aims to support progress in achieving the priorities of the Agenda for Change, help 
reinforce its underlying principles, and actively work to mitigate the risks.  

36 

 
 
 
 
Box 5: Strengthening governance for better development outcomes 

The JAS partners will support the strengthening of country systems and help build the demand for good governance. 
A framework and principles of engagement will emerge from an ongoing governance and political economy analysis 
that will inform the design of new interventions and the implementation of ongoing ones where relevant. A country 
management-led oversight and advisory group will guide the process.  
Strengthening country systems. The JAS partners will provide support for improving public sector management and 
fiduciary systems though ongoing and new operations. In addition, all operations will, where possible and relevant, 
help to build the demand for good governance by promoting transparency, participation, and accountability and 
supporting capacity development of civil society and the media. This approach will also seek to build national 
systems for good governance through support to the Anti-Corruption Commission, through stakeholder consultation 
as to the practical consequences of corruption, and developing the demand for good governance through a focus on 
improved service delivery as a consequence of improved governance. 
Framework and principles. A Governance Framework to be agreed with Government will guide the JAS partners in 
addressing governance-related issues across their portfolios in Sierra Leone. The framework—based on principles of 
accountability, transparency, equity, community consultation and participation, sustainable capacity development, 
and decentralized service delivery—will be applied across all projects and aspects of the project cycle as relevant, to 
provide the information needed to build a mitigation plan for projects in implementation. Project implementation 
during the JAS period will be informed by continuing analytical work on governance constraints and opportunities 
for improvement and complemented by project-level diagnostics to analyze key governance issues and risks 
surrounding a project and propose a mitigation action plan. Adjustments to the framework and principles will be 
made in consultation with Government.  
Development Partners’ Governance Advisory Group. To better address issues of governance in operations, the JAS 
partners will establish an advisory group on governance within the country management teams. The advisory group 
will guide and oversee the integration of agreed principles into the operations and consistency with the framework; 
lead the analytical work and dialogue on governance; and advise project teams during implementation. The advisory 
group will be chaired by the partners’ country managers and coordinated by a country-based governance specialist 
who will also serve as a focal point for development partners and the government.  

78. JAS instruments. In line with Sierra Leone’s consistent performance in macroeconomic 
management, AfDB and IDA will continue their program of development-policy-based lending 
in support of Sierra Leone’s transition from post-conflict recovery to sustainable development. 
The policy-based lending operations support reform measures consistent with the PRSP. They 
will closely complement the investment lending program by supporting the policy reforms 
needed to create enabling environments for effective implementation of the JAS through: (a) 
preserving the fiscal space needed for poverty reduction; (b) promoting efficiency, transparency, 
and accountability in the use of public resources through enhanced public financial management 
and governance (see Box 6); and (c) improving the investment climate by ensuring the provision 
of infrastructure services in a fiscally sustainable manner. 

A. Current and Planned Operations in Support of the PRSP 

79. AfDB/IDA/IFC activities. Much of the partners’ support to the Agenda for Change will 
stem from the implementation of already agreed projects and programs. The project portfolio of 
the JAS partners at the start of the JAS period is shown in Table 5.

Notes:  
a Amounts refer to the proportion of country IDA allocations for regional project financing only. 
Only the FY10 allocation is firm. Estimates for FY11-13 are indicative only and may change. Actual allocations in 
these years will depend on: (a) total IDA resources available; (b) the country’s performance rating; (c) the 
performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; (d) the terms of IDA's assistance to [country] (grants or 
credits); and (e) the number of IDA-eligible countries. The FY12 and FY13 indicative allocations assume a similar 
level of replenishment in IDA16 as in IDA15. IDA allocations are made in SDRs based on performance, and the US 
dollar equivalent is dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate. Finally, the terms of the assistance (i.e. grants, 
credits, or a mix of the two) will depend on Sierra Leone’s debt sustainability position in the corresponding year. In 
addition to the IDA allocations, resources will be mobilized from other sources to augment the resources available 
(cf. Table 8)

81. Trust funds and special funds such as the Food Crisis Response Facility have played a 
significant role in the World Bank’s operations and are anticipated to do so in the JAS period 
(see examples in Table 6 and Table 8). During the 2005-09 CAS period, Sierra Leone received 
US$ 117 million from IDA resources, and it graduated from the exceptional post-conflict 
allocation window in FY07. In recent years the total portfolio has been roughly doubled through 
the utilization of trust and special funds. During the JAS period it is envisaged that trust funds, 
including a proposed MDTF for Growth, will play an equally important role. Similarly, Sierra 
Leone is expected to access additional resources from the regional IDA allocations (fisheries, 
agriculture, mining etc.) and from a temporary IDA Crisis Response Window approved by the 
IDA Board in December 2009). 

82. Leveraging resources. Given the limited economic circumstances of much of the 
population, the limited infrastructure, poor health facilities, and often basic living conditions, 
Sierra Leone remains vulnerable to humanitarian crises as a consequence of pandemics, 
economic shocks, and natural disasters. To respond to these prospective challenges, and to help 
maintain social stability throughout the JAS period, including the sensitive 2012 election year, 
the JAS partners will continue to work with bilateral donors and, increasingly, with important 
private foundations, to seek to mobilize resources to improve human development indicators and 
40 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
address the consequences of all types of shocks. Private investment is another means for 
mobilizing resources; it lends itself to clusters of activity (for example in tourism) that increase 
government revenues, which in turn can facilitate greater investment in infrastructure and skills 
development. To leverage this opportunity for transformative investments, the JAS seeks to 
facilitate private investment as a core component of the development strategy. AfDB’s 
participation in the Addax Bio-energy Project, the largest greenfield investment in Sierra Leone 
since the war, is one example of the catalytic role the JAS partners can play. The World Bank 
Group is also considering participating in this transaction and others of a similar nature in sectors 
such as tourism and agriculture where Sierra Leone has a clear competitive advantage.

83. Knowledge agenda and advisory services. The JAS partners’ program of analytical and 
advisory services will concentrate on thematic areas that are consistent with the JAS objectives, 
in particular: (a) macro/fiscal stability; (b) private sector development; (c) better service delivery 
for the poor; (d) reducing vulnerabilities; and (e) governance (see Table 9). In advisory services, 
IFC is active in investment climate work; during the JAS period, already approved programs will 
provide more than US$2 million of donor trust funds toward the removal of administrative 
barriers, the development of the tourist sector, and the promotion of Sierra Leone as an 
investment destination. IDA’s knowledge agenda will focus on addressing root causes of Sierra 
Leone’s weak development outcomes. A comprehensive study of the political economy of 
governance will lay the basis for a full Institutional and Governance report, including analysis of 
governance in the decentralization process and in the transport and energy sectors, will inform 
the design and implementation of development projects and the governance framework to be 
agreed with government and development partners. A public expenditure review and country 
procurement assessment review will complement these activities and help to ensure that the 
outcomes of analytical studies are appropriately grounded in operations. AfDB will join with 
IDA in the public expenditure review as well as in a gender profile, which will be coordinated 
with a gender diagnostic and audit to be carried out by IDA and other development partners. The 
41 

 
 
 
AfDB non-lending program will also include an agriculture sector review and studies in the 
energy sector, especially renewable energy. Just in time knowledge events will be organized by 
WBI, on operational best practice of relevance to civil society and Government officials. 

84. A country economic memorandum will identify the key development issues facing Sierra 
Leone. , Together with a recently completed Poverty Assessment, these studies will deepen 
understanding of the underlying causes of poverty in Sierra Leone and serve to identify priorities 
in addressing immediate needs. The sector analyses conducted for the country economic 
memorandum will help the JAS partners better assist the government in addressing the 
bottlenecks to reaching a higher level of economic development as well as determining 
opportunities for private sector investment for growth and employment creation.

B. Program Delivery and Outcomes 

85. The structure of the JAS follows the approach of the Agenda for Change. The Agenda 
for Change establishes four strategic priorities—human development, energy, transport, and 
agriculture—whose attainment is seen to require four core preconditions: good governance, 
macroeconomic stability, private sector development, and sustainable natural resource 
management. The JAS concentrates its activities on two pillars, Human Development 
(encompassing the activities in health, education, water supply and sanitation, and social 
protection) and Inclusive Growth (which captures the government’s focus on infrastructure and 
42 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agriculture). The need for good governance and capacity building, and the core role that it is 
hoped the private sector will play in achieving sustainable growth, underscore the need to 
approach these themes at the national and project level in every sector, rather than as stand-alone 
activities. 

JAS Pillar 1: Human Development  

PRSP Goal 
Ensure sustainable human development through the provision of improved 
social services 

Results Area and Outcomes 
Improved access and quality of basic social services  

Outcome 1: Improved capacity to effectively and efficiently deliver education  
Outcome 2: Improved access to basic health services 
Outcome 3: Increased household access to safe drinking water and sanitation 
Outcome 4: Improved capacity to manage social risks 
Outcome 5: Improved predictability, expenditure controls, and transparency in public 
resource management and decentralization

Outcome 1: Improved capacity to effectively and efficiently deliver education  

86. The Government of Sierra Leone has taken steps to ensure access to primary education 
for all children, and these have yielded primary gross enrollment rates in excess of 100 
percent. However, important challenges remain, including low human resource capacity, 
shortages of teaching and learning material, high pupil ratios in schools, poor accountability, low 
primary school completion rates, and high repetition and drop-out rates. AfDB and IDA both 
provide ongoing support for education. AfDB is assisting through its ongoing Education III 
Project, of Support to Basic Education and Rehabilitation of Basic and Non-formal Education 
and Vocational Training, while IDA is assisting through the new multi-donor trust funded 
Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) and the recent Rehabilitation of Basic 
Education Project (closed in December 2009). IFC’s interventions in the education sector will 
focus on private sector opportunities and will initially focus on advisory services through the 
Africa Schools Facility.16  

Outcome 2: Improved access to basic health services 

87. Government has prioritized interventions focusing on the reduction of child and 
maternal mortality rates, with focus on community participation and coordination to ensure 
sustainability and uptake, and on preventative services such as insecticide- treated nets and 
intermittent preventative 
treatment. The JAS partners are assisting 
through AfDB’s 
Strengthening of District Health Services Project and IDA’s ongoing Health Sector 

16 The IFC Africa Schools Facility has begun a scoping study into opportunities for private education.

Reconstruction Project and Reproductive and Child Health Project.17 IFC’s interventions in the 
health sector will focus on exploring private sector investment opportunities via IFC’s Health in 
Africa initiative. AfDB is now considering a request from the Mano River Secretariat for a 
second phase of its Mano River HIV/AIDs project.  

Outcome 3: Increased household access to safe drinking water and sanitation 

88. 
In February 2009 Cabinet approved a National Water and Sanitation Policy whose 
overarching aim is to make available potable water, preferably piped water, to as many people 
as possible. The policy targets high population density areas, including large villages. The 
Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project planned by AfDB for 2010 will improve access to 
drinking water for urban populations while the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project 
planned for 2011 will improve rural access to water supply and sanitation services. IDA will 
support these AfDB initiatives through the ongoing Power and Water Project and through the 
new Decentralized Service Delivery project. In addition, a new Freetown Water Supply and 
Rehabilitation project, funded by DfID and administered by the World Bank, is helping the 
upgrade and repair of key water supply transmission lines.  

Outcome 4: Improved capacity to manage social risks 

89. Sierra Leone sits close to the bottom of the UN HDI. Extreme poverty is driven by high 
unemployment and underemployment, particularly among the young, with related high 
economic and social vulnerability and risk to peace. The AfDB Social Action Support Project 
seeks to restore social infrastructure in war-affected communities. In support of the 
government’s new Youth Strategy, being developed under the new Youth Commission in the 
office of the President, IDA is providing support to reduce vulnerabilities and promote 
employment through the National Social Action Project. Within this project, additional financing 
has recently been targeted to cash-for-work programs that augment the project’s original 
community-driven approaches. The planned Youth Employment and Skills project (prepared in 
cooperation with UNDP and GTZ) will take a more comprehensive approach, for example, 
agricultural employment,  smallholder activities and reforestation in rural areas; waste 
management, road maintenance, vocational training and apprenticeships in urban areas; as well 
as basic skills enhancement and youth empowerment. It will enhance the sustainability aspects, 
changing the focus from an immediate safety-net-related works program to skills enhancement 
and job creation. Smaller trust-funded activities such as Promoting Sustainable Youth 
Employment (through the Youth Entrepreneurship Trust Fund) will push in the same direction, 
seeking to improve the skills of young people out of school and to enhance their job 
opportunities. Given the particularly vulnerable position of women among the marginalized, 
these interventions will include specific efforts to support the economic empowerment of women 
(see Box 6).  

17 Financed through the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF) and led by IDA. This will be supplemented by a 
follow-on project (RCHP2) during the JAS period. 

44 

 
 
                                                 
Box 6: Mainstreaming the gender dialogue 

While the 2009 Client Survey carried out by the World Bank would suggest that gender disparities are not 
considered a development priority in Sierra Leone, the country consultations indicated this interpretation may be 
simplistic. Rather it is suggested that economic empowerment for women is seen as being the key to addressing 
gender issues at the current stage, perhaps reflecting the low levels of trust in a society where self reliance is the 
norm and financial means are a prerequisite for protection under the law and in society.  
Recognizing this preference, the JAS partners have sought to mainstream gender considerations into their 
projects:  
• 
Cash for works and CDD projects require that 40 percent of those employed are women; 
• 
The Reproductive and Child Health Project focuses largely on women’s health issues; 
• 
The education projects have targets for girls’ enrollment and have shown good results in this respect. 
AfDB and IDA are planning, with key partners DfID and the EC, to conduct a Country Gender Assessment and 
Gender Profile to include a gender audit of their operations and approaches. AfDB is planning a gender profile 
for 2010.  

Outcome 5: Improved Governance, Capacity and Transparency 

90. Capacity building stands out as a key challenge in all reforms. Though Sierra Leone has 
made significant progress in rebuilding state institutions and safeguarding public resource 
management, enhancement in capacity at all levels is required to enable government to convert 
policies into actionable administrative processes.  IDA is helping to address this need across its 
portfolio. In addition to two public sector capacity building projects, (IPFMP) and the 
Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP), two new projects for the Education 
and Health sectors both include training and education components for sector staff. The Rural 
and Private Sector Development project includes capacity building for agricultural staff and for 
SLIEPA. The Mining TA project will strengthen capacity in the Ministry of Minerals. The 
planned Financial Sector Development Project will strengthen capacity in the central bank and in 
the banking sector. A grant for the Anti Corruption Commission will help augment the 
Commission’s capacity.  

91. Capacity building for central government. IDA’s Integrated Public Financial Management 
Project (IPFMP), focuses on building capacity in central government, and the IRCBP t addresses 
needs of both central government and local authorities.  These two projects provide support for 
the rollout of the Integrated Financial Management Information System to remaining ministries, 
departments, and agencies; the verification of government payroll; the extension and deepening 
of internal audit; strengthening local government financial management; and legal and regulatory 
reform. The IRCBP also includes specific capacity support to Parliament and support to non-
state actors, including enhanced capacity to provide accountability checks on government 
operations and service delivery. The AfDB and support for the public sector reform program is 
channeled through policy lending, which supports better budget execution, public/civil service 
reform, procurement reform, and decentralization 

. 

92. At the local council level, the JAS partners are helping the government to build capacity 
and devolve service delivery functions through the IDA Decentralized Service Delivery Project, 
45 

 
 
 
 
 
which supports delivery of basic health, education, and clean water services, with a follow-on 
project later in the JAS period. The planned Reproductive Health Project (from the Africa 
Growth Catalytic Fund),  the existing Education for All project and the  Global Fund for AIDS, 
TB, and Malaria will all provide capacity building to enhance the provision of basic services to 
the poor.  

93. 
 IDA projects include activities to strengthen transparency and accountability, notably 
through engaging civil society in providing pressures for oversight and accountability. The 
IDA programs for basic service delivery all make use of civil society engagement to enhance 
transparency and accountability. To support good governance in decentralization, a Justice for 
the Poor team will provide expertise on local-level dynamics of justice and communities’ 
capacity to hold local councils accountable. IDA and AfDB will provide support for finalizing a 
Freedom of Information Bill, which is now in preparation and scheduled for Parliamentary 
approval in 2010; the new law is expected to strengthen accountability and transparency in the 
delivery of public services. AfDB’s ongoing Institutional Support Project will help the 
government develop efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the use of public resources. 
Dedicated programs on key capacity issues will be offered by WBI and the African Capacity 
Building Foundation, through a variety of delivery approaches. 

Box 7: The capacity challenge exemplified by the public financial management 
reform in Sierra Leone 

The government has made steady progress in strengthening its public financial management framework and 
systems, and has implemented most of the recommendations made in the Country Financial Accountability 
Assessment conducted in 2002. This process has been supported by IDA through IRCBP and technical assistance 
from AfDB along with DfID and the EC. Major achievements include establishment of the legal and regulatory 
framework for budgeting, accountability, and procurement; implementation of a financial management 
information system (FMIS); removal of the backlog of annual financial statements; and establishment of basic 
budgeting, procurement, and accounting procedures in the local councils.  

As a result, the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment for Sierra Leone carried out 
in early 2007 found Sierra Leone’s performance to be similar to the average for other countries in the region. 
Since then, the timeliness of financial statements and audit reports has improved further. Analyses such as the  
June 2008 IMF red cover report Sierra Leone: Implementing Public Financial Management Reforms indicate 
that areas of major weakness remain. The analyses identify lack of budget credibility and predictability, fiscal 
management challenges, weaknesses in expenditure control (including payroll), and low levels of transparency; 
and note that much remains to be done to move the system from one that is functioning at a rudimentary level to 
one that is able to direct resources to priority areas and support high quality expenditure outcomes. 

To build on the progress to date and to tackle these challenges, the government has prepared a comprehensive 
program of PFM reforms. IDA along with DfID and the EC are supporting this through the US $ 20.9 million 
Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project which will support the government in sustainably 
improving the credibility, control, and transparency of fiscal and budget management through a pooled financing 
arrangement.

JAS Pillar 2: Promoting Inclusive Growth  

PRSP Goal 
Achieve an annual growth rate of 10 percent or more through investment in 
infrastructure, public sector service delivery, and private sector development 

Results Area and Outcomes 

Outcome 6: Enhanced productivity in agriculture and fisheries 
Outcome 7: Build and sustain a better investment climate 
Outcome 8: Broaden electricity supply throughout the country 
Outcome 9: Maintain and extend key transport infrastructure

Outcome 6: Enhanced productivity in agriculture and fisheries 
94. The JAS partners’ support to agriculture focuses on empowering private producers 
through improvements in infrastructure and access to technology and credit.  IDA will 
concentrate on the development of the agricultural value chain of input supply, production, 
agroprocessing, and exports through the Rural Private Sector Development project and in 
coordination with the enhanced integrated framework provided by the Diagnostic Trade 
Integration Study. The rural feeder roads projects of both banks are seen as crucial to link farms 
to markets. AfDB is also assisting through the NERICA Rice Dissemination Project. IFC will 
explore supporting agribusiness through two approaches. First, to promote flows of finance into 
agriculture, the Corporation will explore the development of innovative financing strategies 
through local commercial banks to increase their capabilities to invest in agriculture and to 
finance trade. Second, IFC’s new SME Ventures Fund will seek to provide direct financing and 
advisory services to small and medium enterprises. AfDB’s private sector operations will seek to 
provide long-term capital for the Addax Bio-energy Project, which will produce ethanol for 
export and electricity as a byproduct. IFC will also seek prospective investments in commercial 
agribusiness, and will explore opportunities for value chain development in sub-sectors where 
Sierra Leone may have a comparative advantage versus regional and global competitors.18 IFC 
advisory services will target improving the business environment for agriculture; they will 
explore opportunities to support the development of innovative structures and frameworks that 
increase land utilization for commercial agriculture and the development of small-holder and 
out-grower schemes, as well as to support improvements in processes and institutions for cross-
border trade. Since women make up 52 percent of the country’s farmers, the JAS partners’ 
programs in agriculture constitute a mechanism for the economic empowerment of women.  

95. A new IDA regional fisheries project will help Sierra Leone, along with neighboring 
countries, to govern and manage targeted fisheries, reduce illegal fishing, and increase local 
value added to fish products. It will: (a) build up the capacity for sustained management of this 
resource and (b) strengthen the national fishing industry, which employs, directly and indirectly, 
400,000–500,000 people. 

18 Sub-sectors could include tree crops with an active outgrower component (oil palm, rubber, cocoa); fishing; grains 
and staples (cassava, rice, corn); processing (vegetable oils); milling (flour and animal feed); and some beverages. 

47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
Outcome 7: Job creation and a better investment climate 

96. AfDB and IDA will develop investment projects and technical assistance for job 
creation. IDA will build upon its ongoing “Cash for Work” program with a new Youth 
Employment and Skills project for skills and capacity development (with particular attention to 
employability in agriculture and agroprocessing, where the lack of a skilled workforce is proving 
to be a bottleneck to commercialization). IDA will also support commercial agriculture and 
improvements 
in related processes and 
institutions 
through 
the Rural Private Sector 
Development Project and through growth poles built around major investments. Assistance to the 
Sierra Leone Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SLIEPA) will improve the Agency’s 
ability to attract private sector investment, including supporting the development of appropriate 
laws and regulations.  IDA’s engagement in the mining sector—through technical assistance to 
the government as well as through trust-funded activities in support of EITI—seeks to enhance 
governance in this sector. The AfDB is exploring the possibility of supporting key components 
of the EITI. The AfDB private sector arm will support equity funds for Cellcom in the area of 
ICT infrastructure and for Ecobank in financial services. Together with IFC, the AfDB private 
sector arm is considering joint activities under the Conflict Affected States in Africa (CASA) 
Initiative.  

97. Advisory services, led by IFC, will target improvements in the investment climate, and 
emphasize privatization and public-private partnerships for infrastructure. in line with the 
government’s Agenda for Change. IFC will support advisory and investment services in Sierra 
Leone and will continue to benchmark Sierra Leone’s overall investment climate through the 
Doing Business indicators. Outcomes supported will include indicators of the time and cost of 
establishing a business and trading across borders. In addition, IFC is currently supporting the 
government’s efforts to streamline the tax administration. These include the introduction of a tax 
regime for small and medium enterprises that will reduce the cost to them of tax compliance. IFC 
is also supporting the National Social Security and Insurance Trust to identify an international 
investor/operator to renovate and operate the Cape Sierra Hotel; this should lead to the creation 
of the first business hotel in Sierra Leone. IFC’s support to the Sierra Leone Business Forum 
includes enhancing the private sector’s capacity to advocate for the implementation of reforms to 
the business environment.  

98. Since limited access to finance holds back economic development, the Agenda for 
Change places strong emphasis on the need for a well functioning financial system. To assist 
in this endeavor, IDA, along with German Development Cooperation, has helped the government 
to prepare a Financial Sector Development Plan. The Plan outlines a series of actions and reform 
measures 
intended 
to strengthen 
the commercial banking system and 
improve 
its 
competitiveness, enhance rural financial access, and strengthen the regulatory and policy 
framework. Accompanied by appropriate legislative changes, these reforms should result in 
deeper financial intermediation, the creation of new instruments to facilitate investment, and the 
establishment of new financial institutions to increase outreach. IFC will focus on investment 
and advisory services to establish the legal framework for leasing and will continue to support 
commercial banks through trade finance facilities, including capacity building for effective use 
of letters of credit. IFC will also explore opportunities to develop innovative financing strategies 
with local commercial banks, so as to increase their ability to provide credit to different sectors 

48 

 
of the economy (agriculture, SMEs, etc). Also, as noted above, IFC will deploy its new SME 
Ventures Fund in Sierra Leone.  

Outcome 8: Broaden electricity supply throughout the country  

99. Both AfDB and IDA continue to work closely with the government in connection with 
the Bumbuna hydroelectric facility. The facility formally commenced operations in November 
2009, but support from IDA for environmental and social safeguards, for distribution of power 
within Freetown, and for enhanced financial management at NPA is ongoing. Both banks will 
support the government in its plans to extend access to electricity. IDA, together with DfID, will 
focus on extending electrification into the provinces and on the development of the energy 
sector, including through public-private partnership. AfDB will seek to support initiatives in 
renewable power generation, notably a private proposal to develop bio-energy (the Addax 
project). The World Bank Group will also explore the possibility of providing support to this 
proposal, most likely through MIGA. IDA will support the government in its plans to extend 
hydroelectric generation. Sierra Leone may be able to benefit from a West African Power Pool 
program to connect Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea and rehabilitate and 
upgrade hydropower plants in the region (possibly including support for expanding Bumbuna’s 
generation capacity by 160 MW or more). 

Outcome 9: Maintain and extend key transport infrastructure 

100. Working in close coordination with other development partners, both AfDB and IDA 
will support the government in the expansion, rehabilitation, and maintenance of the road 
network. During the JAS period both banks will assist in rehabilitating the main trunk road 
system covering some 300km. AfDB will also finance the construction of the approved Lungi-
Port Loko Road and the planned Mototoka to Sefadu Road. IDA will support the government in 
ensuring that the airport remains within International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
standards, as well as in improving the ferry service to the airport and rehabilitating the Freetown 
port (and developing a public-private partnership framework for a landlord port). Through the 
ongoing Rural Private Sector Development project as well as the Infrastructure Development 
Project, IDA will support the rehabilitation of some 900km of rural feeder roads, with an 
additional 500km of feeder roads to be financed by AfDB under three projects. To more 
effectively allocate resources and limit demands on the government’s capacity, AfDB will take 
the lead in the trunk road sector, while IDA will lead for feeder roads. 

101. Through the implementation of the sector strategies for the transport, water, and energy 
sectors and the development of a public-private partnership framework, IDA will help the 
government create an environment conducive to a greater role for the private sector in 
financing and operating infrastructure projects and services. IFC’s financing and advisory 
services will be based on establishing appropriate PPP strategies particularly in the energy and 
port sectors. Where appropriate, IFC will explore opportunities to provide long-term financing to 
investors, particularly for infrastructure serving the country’s strategic sectors, namely 
agriculture and mining.

C. Development Partner Coordination and Aid Effectiveness 

102. AfDB, IDA, and IFC will pursue development policy lending, joint investments, joint 
missions, and shared analytical work. Their engagement and dialogue with stakeholders will 
continue. AfDB and IDA will coordinate along the basis of existing programs and dialogue with 
Government. Most sectors require engagement by both banks, and cooperation takes the form of 
a joint approach and division of labor (as for example in Bumbuna, where AfDB financed the 
completion of construction and IDA addressed the environmental and social aspects). IFC and 
IDA will coordinate their contributions on the basis of respective comparative advantage. For 
advisory services, IFC will focus on issues related to the business-enabling environment and 
privatization, with emphasis on public-private dialogue and reducing administrative barriers. 
IDA will focus on policy advice, including on regulation. IFC investment activities will respond 
to the opportunities and circumstances to be anticipated in a fragile state. Access to finance will 
continue to be an important area for IFC investment, particularly for the small and medium 
enterprise sector. MIGA will continue its program of support to foreign direct investment, with 
agribusiness and trade infrastructure important areas of engagement.  

103. The JAS partners consulted closely with development partners including DfID, the EC, 
German Development Cooperation, and the United Nations agencies, in the preparation of the 
JAS, and work closely with these organizations and others such as the Government of Italy, 
Irish Aid, and JICA, to implement development assistance. DfID and the EC have a joint 
strategy while the various United Nations agencies have a Joint Vision which sets out a 
framework for coordination around a multi-donor trust fund arrangement.19 While DfID and the 
EC are the largest providers of assistance to Sierra Leone, other countries and institutions that 
provide assistance include China, Germany, India, Iran, Ireland, Japan, Kuwait, Libya, and the 
United States of America as well as the Islamic Development Bank, the OPEC Fund for 
International Development, and various development funds, notably from the Middle East.  

104. Sierra Leone is a signatory to the Paris Declaration and its new Aid Policy provides the 
framework for aid alignment and harmonization. Under a Multi-Donor Budget Support 
(MDBS) Framework involving the AfDB, IDA, EU, and DfID, coordination among members 
and with Government has improved. Harmonization allowed the number of triggers used by the 
partners to be reduced successively from 42 in 2006 to 29 in 2007, 27 in 2008, and 14 in 2009. 
An integrated program in public financial management is being implemented by the four MDBS 
partners. Government and development partners have signaled an interest in establishing a multi-
donor trust fund for infrastructure, which will be administered by the World Bank. However, 
much remains to be done to coordinate donors effectively around coherent sector plans in health, 
education, and agriculture. 

105.  Overall, Sierra Leone is making progress on the Paris Declaration benchmarks. The 
2008 OECD Survey monitoring the Paris Declaration shows moderate results on ownership, 
alignment, and harmonization but weak results on managing for results and mutual 
accountability. The reliability of Sierra Leone’s procurement systems was assessed for the first 
time in 2008, using the methodology for self-assessment developed by the Joint Venture on 

19 The DfID and EC joint strategy and the UN Joint Vision are described in more detail in Appendix 16.

Procurement; Sierra Leone received a rating of B. In aggregate, 54 percent of the aid disbursed 
by donors to the government sector was accurately estimated in the government’s budget. A 
summary of the indicators for the 2007 survey, and targets for 2010, are shown in Table 10.

D. Results Monitoring and Evaluation 

106. The JAS will be guided by results and outcomes, and monitoring and evaluation by 
AfDB, IDA, and IFC will be harmonized, including in areas such as development policy 
lending.20 The Results Matrix in Appendix 2 summarizes the PRSP-II objectives that the JAS 
seeks to support, the results that the JAS partners hope to achieve during the JAS period through 
their interventions, and the instruments that all three institutions will use to implement the 
program. Should changes occur during JAS implementation, either in resource availability or due 
to performance issues, activities and investments and advisory services will be adjusted. Annual 
country program reviews, undertaken jointly with the government, will assess the progress of the 
portfolio and the alignment of the banks’ assistance with JAS and PRSP objectives. These 
reviews will serve as inputs to the JAS progress report, which will assess whether the intended 
outcomes are actually being achieved. A completion report will be prepared at the end of the 
four-year JAS cycle to assess the overall progress in achieving the objectives of the JAS. 

107. Monitoring of JAS and portfolio outcomes will be coordinated with the M&E framework 
that the government is developing for the PRSP. IDA has been providing technical assistance 
for capacity building at Statistics Sierra Leone, funded by the Japan Social Development Fund. 
The JAS partners continue to work closely with Statistics Sierra Leone and the Development Aid 
Coordination Office of MoFED in the design and implementation of the monitoring and 
evaluation system.

MANAGING RISKS 

108. As the government moves to implement its Agenda for Change, supported by the JAS 
partners and other donors, a series of significant risk have been identified. Through the Joint 
Assistance Strategy agreed with Government, the JAS partners have identified a series of 
interventions which will help to mitigate these risks.  

A. Weak Governance and Accountability Structures and Traditions  

109. Poor governance and corruption are far from being eliminated in Sierra Leone. Despite 
Sierra Leone’s recently improved ratings in the Transparency International Corruption 
Perceptions Index and the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance, much remains to be done. 
Promoting good governance has been adopted as an overarching theme for the JAS, together 
with measures to operationalize good governance through a coordinated initiative among 
development partners to apply a governance and accountability framework to the development 
operations they support. The JAS partners will seek to establish a forum for dialogue with 
Government to preempt prospective governance hotspots from developing. All projects will be 
required to include a governance strategy and to specify monitorable outcomes that improve 
governance in the relevant sector. The JAS partners will continue to provide support to the Anti-
Corruption Commission and will support other initiatives to promote the demand for good 
governance, including the Freedom of Information Act. They will place special emphasis on 
ensuring that the initiatives for good governance focus on improvements in service delivery that 
can be provided through greater probity and accountability 

B. Limited Capacity to Deliver Services and Manage Public Resources 

110. Limited capacity in the civil service has been a major impediment to development in 
Sierra Leone for some time. The civil service has only a limited capacity to convert government 
policies into actionable administrative processes. Policy implementation is driven by a 
constellation of parallel arrangements, from project implementation units to special units and 
positions heavily subsidized by donors. The short-term solutions of using local and international 
consultants and various mechanisms for increasing the compensation of senior officials have 
militated against the longer-term goal of growing a competent public service through training 
and internal promotion. Sharp salary disparities between mainstream civil servants and those in 
parallel arrangements corrode morale and motivation. Furthermore, past elections have 
exacerbated the challenge of weak institutional capacity through prompting a turnover in civil 
servant and parastatal appointments in the immediate post-election period.  

111. The JAS seeks to mitigate these risks through developing a professional civil service 
cadre, supporting government’s decentralization strategy, and mainstreaming capacity 
building. The experience of 2007—in which the consultants appointed for development projects 
were among the first to be changed by the new administration—highlights the importance of 
mainstreaming project implementation into the government system. Going forward, project 
implementation through government systems will be the norm and deviations from this practice 
will require specific justification. Also, the JAS initiatives for decentralizing basic service 
delivery should help to ensure more predictable government spending, regardless of the election 
cycle, because they provide for transfers to local councils to be based on predetermined formulae 
52 

 
 
that allow limited discretion. The JAS partners’ promotion of the use of the medium-term 
expenditure framework for budget planning, and robust systems of public financial management, 
should also serve to insulate the fiscal from the election cycle.  

C. Youth Employment and Social Instability 

112. Given the issues of youth unemployment and the vestiges of clientelism that are still 
present in Sierra Leone, the risks of serious disruption to economic development and public 
order remain. The JAS period will encompass the election year of 2012. The 2007 election was 
closely contested and it is likely that the 2012 election will put pressure on the government to 
show results, particularly in community development, employment creation, and infrastructure. 
To address the important issue of youth unemployment, the JAS partners, together with other 
development partners such as GTZ and UNDP, will join together in support of the government’s 
new Youth Strategy. While programs such as Cash for Work have enjoyed short-term success in 
avoiding the food riots seen in neighboring countries, through the new Youth Employment and 
Skills Project, IDA proposes to supplement this type of public works scheme with longer-term 
employment generation, supported with skills training guided by ESW for needs assessment. It is 
envisaged that the creation of meaningful employment for the young will help to reduce both the 
cause and the opportunity for social unrest. 

D. Economic Shocks, Including Reduced External Support  

Macroeconomic stability in Sierra Leone may be vulnerable to a worsening global economic 
situation. Deteriorating global economic prospects, along with the country’s graduation from 
post-conflict status, may cause some donors of post-conflict-related assistance to reduce their 
levels of support. To date, however, the amounts provided through development assistance have 
held up well, and donors at the November 2009 CG meeting committed to maintain external 
support at least at current levels. Though the country has managed to weather the storm of 
volatile prices in fuel and food, with the support of development partners, it has limited 
preparedness to deal with further such shocks. Under the JAS, AfDB and the World Bank will 
work closely with other partners, including the United Nations Peace Building Fund and the 
IMF, to promote safety nets  and to mobilize the resources needed to help Sierra Leone limit 
adverse consequences for the most vulnerable people The focus on agricultural development 
under the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program will help Sierra Leone to 
move toward self sufficiency in food staples and to develop export capacity in cash crops, so that 
it is better placed to benefit from higher agricultural prices.  

E. Regional Volatility, Including International Drug Trafficking 

The regional interconnectedness among Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Cote d’Ivoire is 
strong. The UN, ECOWAS, and the Mano River Union are making strong efforts to promote 
stable development and regional integration, but major sub-regional security concerns 
remain. Progress in Liberia, accompanied by the extension of the mandate of the United 
Nations Military in Liberia (UNMIL), has helped to maintain a stable post-conflict 
environment in Sierra Leone. The constantly evolving situation in Guinea will continue to be a 
major concern; Sierra Leone has close ethnic links and an extended border with Guinea, and a 
tradition of cross-border involvement in times of political upheaval, compounded by an ongoing 
low-level border dispute around the town of Yenga. The JAS intends to address the root causes 
53 

 
of conflict in Sierra Leone, but further developmental engagement at a sub-regional level is 
seen to be needed for conflict prevention. The World Bank, AfDB, and other development 
partners are seeking to establish regional solutions for sectors such as fisheries, mining, and 
payment systems. Sierra Leone is perceived to be vulnerable to becoming a conduit for money 
laundering, drug trafficking, and financing terrorism. Together with the IMF, the World Bank is 
seeking to establish a Financial Intelligence Unit at the Bank of Sierra Leone to expose 
malfeasance in the financial system, particularly potential activity related to money laundering 
and financing terrorism or drug trafficking.  

F. Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management 

113. Natural risks and disasters are not new to Sierra Leone, but might be exacerbated by 
effects of climate change in the country, including more frequent severe weather events such 
as heavy rain and associated effects such as flooding and landslides in areas denuded by poor 
land management. It is estimated that 13 percent of the country’s land area and as much as 35.7 
percent of its population are at risk from two or more natural hazards.21 Between 1996 and 
2007, an estimated 220,000 people were affected by three major floods.22 In line with the IDA 
Africa Region’s strategy of Making Development Climate Resilient, the JAS will seek to initiate 
efforts in favor of climate change adaptation and mitigation The JAS partners will seek to ensure 
that large planned infrastructure such as bridges and culverts, as well as maintenance schemes 
for feeder roads, apply the best available know-how. As climate scenario analyses improve for 
Sierra Leone during the JAS period, the JAS partners envisage further in-depth work in this area. 
They will help the government to access current and future financing mechanisms as these 
become available. Subject to future donor funding, such mechanisms may include financing for 
climate change adaptation; reduction of emissions from deforestation and degradation; and 
disaster management through the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. The JAS 
partners will work with others towards a harmonized and strategic approach to natural disaster 
management and climate change. 

Appendix 1: Human Development and Progress towards the Millennium Development 
Goals 

The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide an important reference point for 
achieving Sierra Leone’s objectives with regard to human development outcomes. Halfway 
through the 2015 target of achieving the MDGs, limited progress has been achieved in attaining 
some goals, notably in primary education, combating AIDS and in some aspects of gender 
equality. However, Sierra Leone continues to fall short in achieving goals in the key areas of 
health, education, and water and sanitation. Maternal and child health indicators rank close to the 
bottom in the world. As to be anticipated in a country emerging from conflict, the accuracy and 
reliability of statistics has presented a material challenge in terms of determining progress, and 
support for capacity building in data collection and analysis will be an important tool.  

Data on trends in human development available from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 
(MICS) conducted in 2000 and 2005 suggested limited improvements over the period which still

includes several years of the conflict. The under-five mortality rate was estimated at 286 deaths 
per 1,000 live births, which is far above the average for West and Central Africa. The 
methodology used to calculate this indicator implies that the estimates are retrospective (the 
2000 MICS2 is based on data for 1997 and the 2005 MICS3 estimate applies to 2002, which was 
the year when the conflict ended). The infant mortality rate is also very high and has not 
decreased between the 2000 and 2005 surveys.23 Malnutrition affects a little under one third of 
children, recovery figure which has remained little changed in recent years.24 

There are clear signs of progress in terms of immunization rates. While vaccination rates are now 
better in Sierra Leone than in West and Central Africa, they remain short of the UNICEF goal of 
90 percent or the Millennium Development Goal for measles vaccination of 100 percent. Access 
to improved water sources do not appear to have increased much, but school enrolment has 
dramatically increased, and the gap between vulnerable children such as orphans and other 
children has been reduced. Progress has also been achieved in terms of knowledge about 
HIV/AIDS. On the other hand, a comparison of selected indicators from the 2003 SLIHS and the 
2007 CWIQ suggests progress for both school enrolment and health status. There are large 
differences between net and gross enrolment rates due to the fact that many older children have 
returned to school since the end of the conflict. This also explains why at the primary level, 
between 2003 and 2007, net enrolment rates have increased while gross rates have not. But 
overall, both at the primary and secondary levels, there have been substantial gains in enrolment 
between 2003 and 2007. Also, there seems to have been an important reduction in the share of 
individuals suffering from an illness or an injury between 2003 and 2007, as well as an increase 
in the share of injured or sick individuals seeking care. While part of the gain may represent 
measurement error, the data still points to an improvement in the health status of the population, 
or at least into the subjective perceptions of health status and the demand for, or ability to seek, 
care. 

23 The provisional results of the 2008 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) indicate that the infant and under-five 
child mortality rates have significantly improved to 89 and 140 per 1000 live-births, respectively. 
24 The 2009 World Hunger Index shows under-five malnutrition rising slightly to 28.3 percent.

Country: Sierra Leone 
Date of CAS: May 5, 2005 
Date of CAS Progress Report: November 5, 2008  
Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: FY06-09 
CAS Completion Report Prepared by: Alema Siddiky (Consultant, AFCGH) 

I. 

Introduction 

1. 
This report presents an assessment of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the 
Republic of Sierra Leone for FY06-09. The CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) is a self-assessment. Its 
objective is to assess the World Bank’s contribution to key development results in Sierra Leone. In 
addition, the CAS CR will evaluate the Bank’s portfolio performance, provide lessons learned, and 
highlight the issues that will be addressed by the next CAS. The report evaluates the Bank’s strategy 
against the modified CAS outcomes established in the CAS Progress Report (CAS PR) of November 
2008. Furthermore, the report draws from the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)’s and the Quality 
Assurance Group (QAG)’s evaluations of the Bank’s performance as well as feedback from clients, 
stakeholders, and partners. The report is based on various reference documents29 and discussions with the 
Country team.  
2. 
Overall progress during the CAS period (FY06-09) is rated as moderately satisfactory. This 
rating is based on the sub-ratings for each CAS pillar (section III):  
 Pillar 1: Governance Decentralization and Public Financial Management (Moderately 
satisfactory) 
 Pillar 2: Sustainable Growth, Food Security, and Job Creation (Moderately unsatisfactory) 
 Pillar 3: Human Development (Moderately satisfactory). 

II.  Government’s Strategic Goals and CAS Objective 

3. 
Sierra Leone’s first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (SLPRSP) was published in 
February 2005. SLPRSP focuses on three strategic objectives: (1) good governance, security, and peace; 
(2) pro-poor sustainable economic growth for food security and jobs creation; and (3) human 
development. These objectives were based on several factors such as the emergence of the country from 
civil strife, improving good governance, and the need to reinvest in the productive sector to promote 
growth to support the overarching commitment to reduce the high level of poverty in the country. The 
document had strong ownership within the government and was the subject of extensive frank and open 
discussions throughout the country with key stakeholders. The participatory methodologies included the 
Strategic Planning and Action Process, focus group discussion, and Participatory Poverty Assessment. In 
June 2009, the government launched its second PRSP: “An Agenda for Change” for 2008–12. PRSP II 
focuses on four key strategic priority areas: (1) energy; (2) infrastructure (transport); (3) agriculture; and 
(4) human development, including cross-cutting themes such as good governance, macroeconomic 
stability, private sector development, and natural resource management. The four strategic priorities will 
be underpinned by these cross-cutting themes to achieve sustained growth.  
4. 
The PRS Annual Progress Reports (PRS-APRs) were prepared by the government in 
November 2006 and June 2008. The PRS-APRs provided an assessment of SL-PRS implementation

from June 2005 through December 2007, and, particularly, progress made in macroeconomic stability, 
protection of poverty 
reducing expenditures, public 
financial management 
(PFM) 
reforms, 
decentralization of public services, revitalization of key infrastructure services, and improvement in social 
indicators. The Joint Staff Advisory Notes (JSANs) prepared by the Bank and IMF staff commended the 
government on its overall progress in implementing the strategies and rated the achievements as 
satisfactory.  
The FY06-09 CAS was aligned with the three strategic pillars of SLPRSP (see paragraph 3). 
It focused on governance, decentralization, and public financial management; sustainable growth, food 
security and job creation; and human development. To facilitate effective partnership with the 
government, the Bank aligned its strategy with other development partners and concentrated on the 
overriding challenge of extreme poverty, accentuated by high unemployment, food insecurity, and poor 
social indicators. The CAS also drew on the government’s “Sierra Leone Vision 2025: Strategies for 
National Transformation.”  
6. 
The CAS was results based. Lack of clarity in the CAS monitoring framework has hampered the 
objective assessment of progress. The CAS strategy was developed approximately 26 outcomes with a 
large number of indicators and milestones established to measure these. It is now apparent that the CAS 
results framework was too complex, and contains some inconsistencies in the results terminology as well 
as a number of indicators that are not easily measurable. In addition, Sierra Leone was still a post-conflict 
country with limited or no baseline available to define concrete results. Therefore, the results framework 
of the CAS was too complex and overly ambitious. The CAS PR revised the results matrix, and it reduced 
the number of CAS outcomes from 26 to 9. It was agreed that the overall progress and results of the 
FY06–09 CAS will be evaluated based on the revised results matrix, which was discussed by the Board 
on December 2, 2008.  

III. CAS Progress and Outcomes 

7. 
The following section evaluates outcomes achieved under each pillar during the review 
period and the Bank’s contribution to these outcomes. The criteria used to assess results of the CAS 
were (1) relevance of CAS objectives in the context of Sierra Leone’s development agenda, (2) 
development outcomes supported by the Bank’s program and to what extent these outcomes and 
milestones have been achieved, (3) impact of Bank instruments (lending and analytical), and (4) overall 
Bank’s performance.  

Pillar 1: Governance, Decentralization, and Public Financial Management  

8. 
During the CAS period, the Bank’s support for this pillar focused on government reforms in two 
key areas: (1) fiscal decentralization and empowering local government and (2) improving transparency, 
promoting accountability, and effective public financial management by the central government.  
9. 
Progress under the first pillar is rated as moderately satisfactory. Substantial achievements 
made in the area of decentralization and capacity building and improving public financial management 
provide a foundation for improving service delivery. The Bank’s contribution to Pillar 1 was primarily 
through the Institutional Reform and Capacity Building (IRCBP) project and policy dialogue through two 
development policy operations (GRGG-1 and GRGC-2). 30 Despite Sierra Leone’s weak institutional 
capacity, the reform planned under the CAS period has been largely implemented. In particular, the Bank- 
supported operations helped to improve budget planning and execution and strengthened the PFM system. 
The devolution of key public services to the local councils was generally effective in bringing services 
closer to the people. However, despite this progress, administrative capacity within the local councils is 

30 Governance Reform and Growth Grant/Credit, respectively.  

66

 
 
 
 
                                                 
still weak. The central government requires additional support to provide adequate assistance and training 
to local councils, especially concerning PFM. The preparatory process for budget planning needs to be 
strengthened, and IFMIS needs to be installed and operationalized in all ministries, departments, and 
agencies (MDAs).  
Outcome 1: Local governments able to effectively leverage and manage resources to deliver key 
basic services. 

10. 
This outcome focused on the empowerment of local governments and communities to identify 
local development priorities, leverage resources, and undertake their own development initiatives.  
11. 
Satisfactory progress has been made in implementing decentralization agenda. The Bank 
played an instrumental role in implementing the decentralization and capacity building program, further 
developing legal and regulatory instruments and supporting several statutory bodies to perform their 
policy roles.31 Through the Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP), the Bank 
provided intensive training, technical assistance, and investment to help local councils build basic 
management capacity and a transparent and accountable governance culture. Since the election of local 
councils in 2004, local government systems have been implemented and administrative capacity 
developed in basic budgeting, procurement, and accounting procedures. Local councils have delivered a 
number of devolved basic services functions. Since 2005, the following services have been devolved: fire 
prevention, education, youth and sports, solid waste management, health care, social welfare, gender and 
children affairs, agriculture and food security, and fisheries and marine resources. All 19 local councils 
are functioning and have three-year rolling development plans. Councils have established various 
committees and have annual work plans.  
12. 
The Bank’s support through capacity building has helped local councils learn how to 
manage public resources responsibly with increased citizens’ participation and to deliver improved 
services. Through participatory planning and implementation, local councils identified local development 
priorities and prepared three-year rolling development plans. Financial management capacity at the local 
council level developed quickly. All 19 LCs prepared FY08 budgets that complied with the content 
requirements of section 67 of Local Government Act of 2004. The National Public Survey (NPS) shows 
that, on average, across the country, access and customer satisfaction regarding primary health and 
education improved between 2005 and 2007, and so did access to markets, roads, and water and 
sanitation.  

Outcome 2: Improved transparency and accountability of public resource management at central 
government 

13. 
This outcome focused on strengthening the central government’s PFM system through 
transparent budget formulation, execution, and reporting; establishing a transparent and efficient 
procurement system; and supporting human resource management.  
14. 
The public financial management framework and systems have been strengthened as part 
of a general effort to improve transparency and accountability. The Bank made an effort to 
strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Finance Economic Development (MoFED) to manage the 
budget and lead the PFM reform. The legal framework for financial management was upgraded through 
the Budgeting and Accountability Act (2005) and the accompanying Financial Management Regulations 
(2007). The old Financial Management and Accounting Systems in the Accountant General’s Department 
were replaced with the new Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) in 2005.  

31 Local Government Service Commission, Local Government Finance Committee, and Inter-ministerial Committee 
on Decentralization.  

67

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
15. 
The IFMIS had been expected to facilitate better expenditure control and accounting, including 
donor financing. While a significant number of projects are captured in the development budget, not all of 
them are recorded in the IFMIS and included in financial reports. By 2008, in addition to MoF, the IFMIS 
had been installed in 6 key MDAs responsible for education, health, agriculture, public works, external 
audit, and policing. The Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) have been instrumental in reducing 
budgetary leakages and improving the management of resources in the health and education sectors.32 For 
example, the distribution of drugs to hospitals and health centers and the payment of school fees subsidies 
to primary schools have improved in recent years. In addition, FM capacity at the local council level 
developed quickly where 14 out of 19 LC’s are preparing monthly and annual accounts of budgets and 15 
have displayed development plan on the LC and ward notice boards.  
16. 
Progress has been made in strengthening the Accountant General’s Department by 
recruiting a qualified Accountant General and two deputies. These hires have cleared the backlogged 
public accounts for 2002–06, and have prepared and submitted the 2007 public accounts to the Auditor 
General. Internal audit capacities in 13 key MDAs have been established, but at the moment only 7 of 
them are fully staffed and functional.  
17. 
Budget process and planning has improved. Through the IRCBP, the Bank provided technical 
support to prepare 3-year medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEF) covering 2006–08 with 
monitorable indicators for the key ministries. This achievement has strengthened the budget process. As a 
result, all MDAs now prepare strategic plans that are aligned with the PRSP objectives. However, these 
plans would benefit from more TA in their preparation.  
18. 
Slow progress in implementing the procurement reform agenda. IRCBP supported reforms to 
strengthen the public procurement system through passing new procurement regulations, establishing the 
National Public Procurement Authority (NPPA), and developing procurement plans at the central and 
local government levels. Consistent with the 2004 Procurement Act, NPPA published procurement 
regulations in 2006. These reforms are expected to reduce waste and fraud and will help inform the 
budget process. Nine MDAs prepared procurement plans in 2006, 18 MDAs in 2007, and 23 MDAs in 
2008 for MoFED approval. However, implementation of a number of procurement reform areas has been 
slower than expected. These include inadequate career development and capacity building of procurement 
specialists, inadequate functioning of the NPAA website, absence of procurement audits, and continued 
delay in undertaking the Annual Procurement Forum. While all the LCs now have procurement officers 
with basic procurement training, the councils still are understaffed, ill-equipped, and lack adequate skills. 
NPPA is collaborating with the Institute of Public Administration (IPAM) to train 150 graduates to 
manage procurement in various MDAs.  
19. 
The Bank prepared a range of timely and relevant analytic work that supported several key 
reforms under the development policy lending (GRGC 1 and 2) and IRCBP. The 2006 Report on the 
Observance of Standards and Codes for Accounting and Auditing (ROSC) identified a strong need for 
training in accounting skills in both the private and public sectors. A procurement audit completed in June 
2007 concluded that the initial impact of procurement reform had been positive despite its early stage and 
noted that lessons learned are being applied by the National Public Procurement Authority and MoFED. 
A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Progress Report (PEFA-PR) also was completed in 
2007, on which Sierra Leone scored similarly to the average of other countries of the region despite its 
low starting point at the end of the civil war. In addition, the IRCBP benefited from the TA, advice, and 
recommendations provided 
through 
the World Bank study Decentralization, Democracy, and 
Development: Recent Experience from Sierra Leone.” 

32 PETS have been supported by the Bank’s IRCBP, DfID, and UNDP.

Pillar 2: Sustainable Growth, Food Security, and Jobs Creation 

20. 
Bank support under this pillar concentrated on improving the climate for private sector 
development, investing in supportive infrastructure services, and promoting food security and job creation 
through growth in agriculture and mining. Therefore, four key outcomes have been identified through a 
combination of investment lending, development policy lending operations, and policy dialogue through 
analytical work.  
21. 
The performance under this CAS pillar is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Most of the 
outcomes have not been accomplished, which reflects weak institutional capacity and dependence on 
coordinated policy formulation and implementation. Moderate progress has been made in improving the 
regulatory framework for enabling the business environment and growth in the private sector. Some of the 
important outcomes related to improving financial sustainability and transparency in the utility sector––
particularly in the power sector––have been disappointing. It may be useful to note that more might have 
been achieved had the Bank and DfID, its development partner, been better coordinated to support the 
National Commission for Privatization, which has oversight over the public utilities. The Bank’s 
assistance was relevant in transitioning from post-conflict status to a mainstream development program 
for social stabilization and economic growth. However, change of leadership within the government, 
uneven commitment, and weak capacity also contributed to not achieving these outcomes. While there is 
tremendous need for power sector development, future assistance in this sector depends on the success of 
governance reforms and capacity building within the power utility. Progress in the road sector also has 
been slow. Access to safe water and sanitation improved in both urban and rural areas, and achievements 
have been made in the road network in ensuring connectivity of feeder roads to main roads. The Bank’s 
policy dialogue through analytical work did not make much progress in the agriculture sector, and only 
limited progress was made toward mining sector reforms.  
Outcome 3: Improved investment climate and access to long-term finance 

22. 
This outcome concentrated on simplifying and reducing the cost of investment procedures and 
regulations, and strengthening the financial sector to make it more efficient.  
23. 
The business registration process has been streamlined, but implementation has been slow. 
The Bank supported this reform through the Governance Reform and Growth Credit (GRGG1 and 
GRGC-2) in collaboration with FIAS and DfID. The government made progress in simplifying 
administrative procedures and reducing the cost of doing business through initiating various legislative 
reforms. In 2007 two laws, the General Act on Business Start-ups and the Business Registration Act, have 
been enacted. This simplified process led to a reduction in time and financial cost of establishing 
businesses. This will help to increase private investment and encourage firms to join the formal sector. It 
also increased work permit validity from 1 year to 5 years. In November 2006, with assistance from 
FIAS, the government also completed a study of marginal effective rates of taxation to determine the 
optimal approach to reform business taxation. While the government has done much to accomplish 
legislative reform, its accomplishments have yet to be fully implemented or appreciated by the business 
community.  
24. Modest improvement in the Doing Business indicators. In the 2009 Doing Business Survey, 
Sierra Leone ranked 156 of 178 countries surveyed–– a modest improvement over its 2008 rank of 163 
that places Sierra Leone ahead of neighboring countries.33 For 2 of the indicators “starting a business” and 
“registering property,” Sierra Leone ranked 53 and 163, respectively, of 178 countries––a slight 
improvement over 2008. Sierra Leone performed poorly in labor laws, closing a business, protecting 
investors, and enforcing contracts. When faced with these obstacles, firms often chose to remain in the 

33 Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Liberia.  

69

 
 
 
                                                 
informal sector. In addition, the private sector has emphasized the need to ensure property rights and 
streamline the taxation of small business. The government has set up a Law Reform Commission, which 
is reviewing the scope of important laws critical for furthering the reform agenda and proposing 
amendments based on good practices. In particular, to encourage private investment, the government is 
working on the development of a new Companies Act, Bankruptcy Act, Securities Act, and Payment 
System Act. Work to date has benefitted from Bank input as well as consultancies from The Financial 
Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative and United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization (UNIDO).  
25. 
In addition, private sector credit as a share of GDP increased slightly from 4.5 percent in 
2005 to 6.0 percent in 2008. This strong demand for credit from the private sector came primarily from 
the construction, import trade, and communication sectors. The government has taken steps to recapitalize 
the Bank of Sierra Leone and to create instruments for open market operations. The number of bank 
accounts also increased from 160,000 in 2005 to 200,00034 during the CAS period. To operate a modern 
efficient payment system, the government drafted a Payment System Act, which was approved by the 
Cabinet in February 20, 2008, thus satisfying conditionality for GRGC-2.  
26. 
The government has launched a program to draft a Financial Sector Development Plan 
(FSDP) and is adopting recommendations from the joint Bank-Fund supported “Financial Sector 
Assessment Program (FSAP) study.” This will further strengthen financial sector legislation. However, 
privatization of state-controlled financial institutions has stalled during the CAS period. It had been 
expected that at least 1 of the 2 major government-owned commercial banks could be privatized within 
the CAS period. The result of the divestiture schedule is yet to materialize. Lack of funding and staff 
initially hampered following up on FSAP recommendations. However, the last years of CAS period 
support from the FIRST Initiative enabled the Bank to assist government in the development of the 
Financial Sector Strategy. The latter was a structural performance criterion for the Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Facility (PRGF). The Financial Sector Strategy, a roadmap for the FSDP, was approved by 
Cabinet in June 2008; and a series of analytical studies was carried out covering access to finance, 
commercial banking, insurance and capital markets, AML/CFT, and the development of a credit reference 
bureau. The FSDP was completed by government with assistance from the Bank and German 
Development Corporation in June 2009 and is to be implemented in FY2010.  
27. 
Two important pieces of AAA work were initiated during the CAS period. To facilitate the 
government’s private sector development plan, the Bank prepared a Diagnostic Trade Integrated Study 
(DTIS) in June 2006. An Action Matrix was developed to implement the recommendations that had 
emerged from the study. The Action Matrix was approved by the government in 2006. Its 
recommendations included promoting exports, especially for cocoa, fisheries, and marine products. In 
addition, a major World Bank study “Youth and Employment” proposed labor market reform to improve 
job creation for youth and the unemployed.  
Outcome 4: Improved access to key infrastructure services 

28. 
The Bank’s support in this outcome focused on improving the efficiency of energy and water 
services and rehabilitating road and transport network.  
29. 
 The production of power by the Sierra Leone National Power Authority (NPA) declined to 
3.7 megawatts.35 Furthermore, access to electricity supply was limited during the first part of the 
CAS period to less than 1 percent of the population until November 2007, when the Bank was 
instrumental in supporting the rental of emergency power generators for 12 months. The emergency 
power project provided 15 MW of continuous power through diesel generation in 2008. The project was 

34 Estimate as of 2008. 
35 Compare to already very low 14 megawatts in 2002. 

70

 
 
                                                 
intended to bridge the delayed arrival of continuous power from the Bumbuna hydroelectric dam, which 
was expected in January 2009. However, Bumbuna power has been further delayed.36  
30. 
Throughout this period, the Bank’s timely responses covered (1) facilitating funding from the UN 
Peace Building Fund, mobilized with IDA advocacy; (2) financing capacity and energy charges for the 
rental generators through a reallocation of credit proceeds of the Power and Water Project; and (3) 
through TA, improving the financial performance of the NPA as a result of the revenue inflow from 
emergency power sales. As a result, the sector registered an historic doubling of energy sales. In addition, 
reductions in technical losses and improvements in collections have doubled energy sales, which, 
combined with increased tariffs, trebled revenues for NPA on the same power generation.  
31. 
Commissioning of Bumbuna Hydropower is scheduled for mid-October 2009, using an interim 
operator arrangement initially funded by AfDB. The Bank’s contribution to the power sector came from 
the Power and Water Project, the Bumbuna Hydropower Safeguard Project (BHP), and conditionalities in 
two Development Policy Lending Development Policy Operations (DPOs) (GRGG1 and GRGC2). IDA’s 
Board approved a partial risk guarantee (PRG) of US$38 million to mobilize commercial funding to 
complete civil works, as well as a grant of US$12.5 million to assist with safeguards compliance.37 
However, the PRG was never used and is now proposed to be restructured. IDA’s funding of Bumbuna to 
June 2009 consisted solely of the Safeguards grant of $12.5 million. However, by ensuring that the BHP 
is environmentally and socially sustainable, the Bank has leveraged additional funding from AfDB and 
DfID to support additional environmental and social activities. In addition, the quality of RAP 
implementation, including ongoing livelihood restoration and food support, community development, and 
benefit sharing was rated highly satisfactory by the Environment and Social Advisory Panel (ESAP) in 
June 2008 and February 2009.  
32. 
The power component of the Bank’s Power and Water Project was meant to upgrade the 
distribution network to allow consumer access to power from Bumbuna and restore financial 
viability to the National Power Authority (NPA).38 Despite the provision of IDA support and 
motivating conditionalities, much of the intended work was never started or not completed. NPA power 
generation deteriorated further during 2006 and collapsed in 2007, largely due to governance issues. IDA 
and other donor partners were unable to follow the cash inflows and outflows of NPA. At the request of 
the new government, the Bank responded quickly by restructuring the power component of the Power and 
Water Project to facilitate the procurement of 12 months of emergency thermal power (15 MW) in 
Freetown in 2007, in anticipation of Bumbuna Power arrival in early 2009. The cost of fuel for the rented 
power was the single largest expenditure in government’s 2008 budget. NPA has increased its tariff by 50 
percent (to an average of 42 cents/kwh) and has introduced a system of meters and additional measures to 
reduce technical losses and increase collections. Figures provided by NPA suggest that these actions have 
trebled revenues since the emergency power program commenced. Nevertheless, these actions have not 
been sufficient to reach profitability, and depreciation of the Leone will exacerbate the challenge.39  
33. 
Additional delays in completion of the BHP and its transmission line have necessitated a 
costly extension of rented power. To help finance the extension, the government requested a further 
restructuring of the Power and Water Project. After extensive internal and external consultations, the 
Bank determined that this would be possible only if key operational and governance issues were 
addressed. These included making effective the IDA-funded contract to upgrade the distribution network; 

36  Government has extended the emergency power program for a further 9 months, initially assisted with funding 
from the UN Peace Building Fund, and more recently with own resources.  
37  OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) provided $10 million for rehabilitation of high voltage 
transmission line from Bumbuna to Freetown. AfDB also provided funding for institutional capacity. 
38 T he project objectives associated with NPA revenues and operating costs were backed by conditionalities through 
GRGC 1 and 2. 
39  The tariff was set in Leones and is now equivalent to approximately US$0.35/kwh 

71

 
 
                                                 
strengthening the management of NPA; and ensuring that appropriate institutional arrangements were 
made for Bumbuna’s relationship to NPA. Despite the Bank’s intensive dialogue with the government, 
none of these actions was completed within a timeframe that would have enabled IDA to proceed 
(although the actions were completed later). As a result, the distribution network now accommodates only 
around 20 MW. However, given the delays in bringing on Bumbuna, this amount matched the generation 
capacity during the CAS period. The contract to rehabilitate the distribution network in Freetown was 
finally was made effective in mid-March 2009 and has a very compressed timetable for completion before 
the project closing date in March 2010. At the end of the CAS period, a number of safeguards compliance 
issues on resettlement were being addressed before the contract could fully start up.  
34. 
The Bank’s approach to the power sector may have been flawed. Several governance 
problems were not well addressed in the original design of the Power and Water Project. Administration 
of the BHP also was opaque with large but unproven claims made by the main contractor. These issues 
should have been explicitly addressed or, failing that, the power component could have been dropped. 
Support for the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Project was pledged (just prior to the CAS period) without 
adequate financing, leading to a failed attempt to use a partial risk guarantee to leverage additional donor 
financing. In the end, the Bank settled on limiting BHP support to safeguards work. Support for the BHP 
and the rehabilitation of the distribution network of the NPA was treated as separate projects despite a 
high degree of interdependency. Finally, periodic administrative problems were created by combining 
power sector objectives with water sector objectives. Implementation capacity within the government was 
extremely weak. In addition, some experienced project staff in the project implementation unit (PIU) were 
discharged by Government. Their loss further slowed project implementation and led to the rating of 
unsatisfactory for the power component of the Power and Water Project implementation progress rating.  
35. 
Despite substantial TA, the operational performance of the urban water supply remains 
weak. The water component of the Power and Water Project provided support to improve the financial 
management and business practices. The performance of the Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC) 
continues to face technical difficulties (aging and poorly maintained network, high water losses due to 
leakage) and commercial losses (low billing and collection ratios). These deficiencies are exacerbated by 
pervasive illegal connections and inadequate water tariffs. The Bank emphasized the need for strong and 
urgent government measures to address these challenges. In addition, a new Freetown Water Supply and 
Rehabilitation Project, funded by DfID and administered by the Bank, is helping to upgrade and repair 
key water supply transmission lines and the emergency pipe repair and replacement program.  
36. 
Access to water supply and sanitation in rural and urban areas has improved recently 
although there has been some delay. Bank support made tangible progress in the rural water and 
sanitation last year, even though it was almost three years after the implementation of the project. As of 
May 2009, 100 water supply systems have been completed, which provided access to clean drinking 
water to 64,000 rural residents, additional facilities recently completed are expected to increase the total 
provided access to drinking water to 110,000 people. However, implementation of sanitation facilities has 
been slow, with 1,800 household latrines having been completed providing approximately 25,000 rural 
residents access to adequate rural sanitation facilities. The access to improved essential urban water 
supply in Freetown has been provided through the Bank-executed Trust Fund Freetown Water Supply 
Rehabilitation Project. There have been some improvements in water supply in Freetown: the number of 
registered customers increased from 11,000 in 2007 to 14,500 in 2009 and water metered customers from 
2,400 to 4,200 during the same period. In February 2009, the Cabinet approved a National Water and 
Sanitation Policy, which provides an overall strategy to address the challenges facing the sector and 
strives to achieve the MDGs. The Bank has been an active partner through policy dialogue and expects to 
share “best practice” in the sector drawing on operational experience from the region.  
37. 
Limited progress was made in improving the road network. Progress in connecting feeder 
roads to main roads in select districts supported by the Bank-financed Infrastructure Development Project 

72

 
 
(IDP) has been slow.40 (The prioritization process for reconstruction conducted by the district and local 
communities in Kailahun, Kono, Koinadugu, and Bonthe were finalized only toward the end of the CAS 
period.) In parallel, through the National Social Action Project (NSAP), 164 km of community roads have 
been rehabilitated. They will provide rural people with access to passable roads, markets, and other basic 
services. In addition, the Bank’s policy dialogue on institutional reform through the IDP supported the 
government from preparation to implementation of a detailed Road Maintenance Action Plan for 
restructuring the Sierra Leone Road Authority (SLRA), separation of Road Maintenance Fund, and 
privatization of the Mechanical Services Unit. However, progress in the implementation of institutional 
reform action plans has been slow due to lack of capacity and leadership at SLRA. SLRA also needs to 
consult with district councils and other stakeholders on the reform agenda.  
Outcome 5: Increased agriculture production in targeted areas 

38. 
The Bank’s contribution to increase agriculture production was very limited. During the 
CAS period, three key pieces of analytical work were produced. (1) Revitalizing Rural Development and 
Agriculture emphasized the development of agriculture markets, a dynamic agribusiness sector, and 
support for infrastructure. (2) The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) also identified constraints 
and opportunities in agriculture and other sectors. (3) Finally, the Youth Employment Study also 
identified opportunities for support to the rural economy. However, the Ministry of Agriculture initially 
was little guided by the Bank’s report on agriculture or the DTIS. However, this situation improved in the 
final years of the CAS, and the DTIS was used as the guiding reference for the preparation of the Rural 
and Private Sector Development Project.41 Nevertheless, this project was delayed in implementation at 
least in part due to inadequate coordination between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Trade 
and Industry. As such, the Bank’s direct contribution to increased agriculture production has been limited. 
The Rural Private Sector Development Project (RPSD) was restructured recently. It intends to scale up 
the rehabilitation of feeder roads to open the rural areas to markets and will provide more scope for value 
addition and private investment in agriculture.  

Outcome 6: Improved management of the mining sector  

39. 

The Bank’s contribution toward this outcome came primarily from the GRGG 1 and GRGC 2 and 
through collaboration with DfID and UNDP. Although the CAS included a focused Technical Assistance 
Project for the mining sector, it was not achieved during the CAS period.  

40. 
. Limited progress was made to improve the efficiency and transparency of the mining 
sector management. The Bank focused on improving the legal and regulatory framework in the 
mining sector. In fact, a computerized cadastre-based system to administer mining rights was 
designed and introduced in 2006, largely through unplanned assistance from the UNDP. The 
system was piloted in the main diamond-producing district of Kono and has expanded slowly. 
However, the full capacity of the system is not being used, particularly with regard to large 
mining firms and revenue transparency. The underuse could be due to limited ownership of the 
cadastral system at the Ministry of Mining and Mineral Resources (MMR). No progress was 
made during the CAS period in improving the legal and regulatory framework in the mining 
sector. Mining laws were last revised in 2005. Equally limited progress was made in improving 

40 Additional financing of US$5.9 mil was approved by the Board in May, 2008 which would enable the project to 
meet its initial Development Objective to rehabilitate selected priority roads, port and airport facilities and support 
the regulatory and institutional reform.  
41 The Rural and Private Sector Development project intends to raise rural incomes through improved agricultural 
exports and farm revenues.

the quality and geographic coverage of mining extension services. The cadastral system has 
expanded but not as much as expected. It is possible that the mining sector objectives might have 
been advanced further if the planned Mining Sector TA had not been delayed until FY104243 
Pillar 3: Human Development  

43. 

42. 

41. 
The Bank’s strategy focused on promoting human development. HD includes expanding quality 
basic education and training, increasing access to health and nutrition services, preventing HIV/AIDS, 
and improving the quality of life of the vulnerable.  
Progress under this pillar is rated as moderately satisfactory. In education, significant 
progress has been made toward the CAS outcome of improved universal access to education services. 
However, quality remains a challenge, and improvements in this area will require more time. In the 
future, the focus should be education quality. Capacity at the higher institutions of learning needs to be 
strengthened so that the standard of education will not continue to drop. The education system at the 
primary level needs to be aligned with future labor skill requirements, and a long-term policy to 
professionalize teaching should be developed. Issues of provision of adequate education for those with 
special needs also should be addressed.  
In the health sector, Bank support rehabilitated health facilities (12 primary health units, or PHUs, 
and 4 hospitals); provided equipment to 50 PHUs; and strengthened technical programs such as malaria, 
TB, leprosy, and onchocerciasis. Key health indicators improved but remain among the worst in the 
world. The Bank needs to continue to work to improve these key health indicators to achieve the health 
MDGs and support the government in sustaining and expanding affordable health care facilities. Access 
to both health care and education facilities has improved through a massive effort to build or rehabilitate 
infrastructure using community-driven development (CDD) methodologies.  
The Bank’s intervention on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment was in time given the post-
conflict capacity with no proper facilities. The 2008 DHS survey indicates a slight decrease in HIV/AIDs 
prevalence from 1.8 to 1.5 percent of the sexually active population.  
In addition, the Bank made good progress integrating vulnerable populations through community 
development initiatives and income-generating activities. Future strategy need to focus on continuing to 
engage communities in the local development process and institutionalizing community participation in 
planning, implementation, and monitoring local development interventions.  
Outcome 7: Re-establish education services and improve quality and equity in targeted areas  

44. 

45. 

46. 
Access to basic education improved significantly, but quality remains an issue. The Bank’s 
support through Rehabilitation of Basic Education helped to reestablish education services in Sierra 
Leone and thus facilitated considerable improvement in recent years. Notable achievement has been made 
in two key indicators: primary school enrollment and primary completion rate. The primary gross 
enrollment ratio (GER) increased from 64 percent in 2004 to 154 percent in 2007, and junior secondary to 
44 percent. The percentage of girls’ enrollment slightly exceeds targets at 47 percent in primary and 41 
percent in junior secondary schools. These successes are attributed primarily to the abolition of school 
fees, school feeding programs in selected areas, and improvements in educational infrastructure. The 
Bank has helped rehabilitate and/or construct 100 of 221 planned schools. Quality is supported by 
distributing textbooks and training teachers. Over 490,000 sets of textbooks (of the target of 500,000) 
have been distributed to primary schools, and over 45,000 sets (of the target of 50,000) have been 

42 The TA was delayed at the request of government.  
43 At the end of the CAS period, it was not determined whether the Mining TA would continue as a national project 
or be folded into a regional mining governance project. It has since been decided to pursue both approaches.  

74

 
 
 
 
                                                 
distributed to junior secondary schools. A total of 4,010 primary teachers have been trained. The 
Education Management System (EMS) is now functional. In addition, 314 School Management 
Committees (SMCs) have been trained, and an estimated 203 are functioning to ensure the continued 
improvement of education quality. Despite these efforts, educational quality and results remain 
unsatisfactory. The 2007 National Primary School Examination pass rate was 69 percent (target was 75 
percent), a 3-point drop from the 2004 result. The pupil/textbook ratio remains far below the 1:1 target for 
core textbooks at the basic level. A number of factors such as inadequate school supervision by local 
councils, lack of strategic planning and M&E capacity at central and local levels, inefficient teacher 
deployment, and a large number of unqualified teachers as part of the cadre contributed to the poor 
quality of education in the country.  
47. 
The Bank completed a Poverty Diagnostic Report. Based on the 2007 Core Welfare 
Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) results, the report provided a basic diagnostic of the education 
sector from the household perspective. Findings from the report show that lack of books and supplies, 
high fees, and poor facilities are among the main reasons for potential students’ never entering school or 
stopping their education. The report provides recommendations and priorities for future policy in the 
education sector.  
48. 
The Bank prepared a Country Status Report for Education (CSR), which assessed the 
education system in Sierra Leone. The report was used as a guide to prepare a sector-wide strategy to 
provide a framework for development partners’ support. The study also served government and 
development partners as a useful tool to prepare Sierra Leone’s vision for the education sector and to 
implement government policies. Education Sector Development Partners (DPs) recently finalized the 
implementation plan, funding modality, and monitoring indicators for the Education for All Fast Track 
Initiative Grant.44  
Outcome 8: Improved access to basic health services in four districts 

49. 
The Bank’s contribution to this outcome was to improve access to and quality of health care 
facilities and to strengthen implementation of key public health programs for malaria, TB, and 
onchocerciasis.  
50. 
Healthcare coverage increased in the targeted areas, resulting in positive effects on overall 
outcomes during the CAS period. The Bank supported the health sector through the Health Sector 
Reconstruction and Development Project (HRSDP)45 and phase 1 of the Reproductive and Child Health 
Project (RCHP) to restore the most essential functions of the health sector delivery system. National panel 
data from 2005 and 2007 provide evidence of improvements in access to health care services and overall 
satisfaction with these services. The following results were achieved during the CAS period: (1) access to 
primary health care unit (PHU) in 4 priority districts increased from 41 percent to 67 percent; (2) 
rehabilitation of 1 of the 4 hospitals and 8 of the 12 PHUs has been completed; (3) full immunization of 
children aged from 12–23 months increased to 79 percent (with an end target of 75 percent); (4) 
geographic coverage of community-directed Ivermectin distribution (CDTI) increased from 0 percent in 
2005 to 98.5 percent in 2007; (5) 63 percent of pregnant women sleep regularly under insecticide-treated 
bed nets; (6) 67 percent of children under 5 years of age sleep regularly under insecticide-treated bed nets; 
(7) 1 of the 4 hospitals under rehabilitation or construction has been completed, and 8 of 12 primary 
health facilities have been completed and (8) the percentage of TB-smear-positive cases successfully 
treated under the direct observed treatment strategy has increased from 76.5 to 81 percent.  
51. 
The first phase of the trust-fund-supported RCHP helped to lay the foundation to 
implement of the Government’s Reproductive and Child Health Strategic Plan. Although there were 

44 The Bank is preparing a grant agreement at the request of the MOFED.  
45 The project received an additional US$8 million to help construct additional facilities and to support 
onchocerciasis and avian flu prevention activities.

delays in disbursements and procurement of goods, 9 of the 13 indicators districts met their targets for a 
variety of indicators such as immunization coverage, timely return of reporting reforms, and regular 
supervision. Phase 1 was crucial for indentifying and resolving institutional constraints prior to the 
implementation of Phase 2.  
Prevalence of HIV/AIDs has stabilized. The 2008 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 
showed that HIV/AIDs prevalence among 15–49 year olds declined from 1.8 percent to 1.5 percent over 
the CAS period. Through the HIV/AIDS Response Project, IDA provided prevention, care, and treatment 
services for HIV/AIDS. The Bank responded in a timely fashion to organize a multisectoral response to 
the HIV/AIDS crisis in Sierra Leone after a long civil war. In particular, the Bank’s program was 
successful in mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS by protecting the general population through proper 
blood screening. This was not available prior to the project and has reached 100 percent of its target. 
These outcomes are considerable given the post-conflict limited capacity setting. The project also helped 
to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on children and pregnant women by scaling up Prevention of Mother 
to Child Transmission (PMTCT) services. 
Outcome 9: Improved capacity to manage social risks 

53. 
The Bank’s strategy under this outcome emphasized the need to strengthen social protection and 
safety nets for vulnerable groups.  
54. 
The social protection strategy was not developed during the review period, although 
progress was made in strengthening and empowering vulnerable groups and their communities. A 
working group has been established to work on a social protection strategy and policy. At this time, the 
National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) in collaboration with the Ministry of Labor and 
Employment has prepared only a concept paper, which has been circulated to the Cabinet for discussion. 
The Bank provided support to this initiative through the National Social Action Project (NSAP). The 
Bank’s help came due to weak technical capacity within the Ministry of Social Welfare and limited 
priority given by the government. However, progress has been made in building and restoring 
infrastructure and services in communities. A 2006 beneficiary assessment showed that implementation 
of the NSAP projects enhanced social cohesion at the community level. As of June 2009, (1) 600 
community- based subprojects had been generated (target 600), with 574 completed and 26 near 
completion; (2) 908 housing units had been built (with a target of 1,200) and (3) nearly 161 km of feeder 
roads had been rehabilitated (with a target of 100km). In addition, 145, 000 person-days of employment 
were created in the rural roads component of the public works program. The Bank has strengthened and 
empowered communities and local governments through community development initiatives and income-
generating activities. In light of the post-conflict environment, a community-based approach to address 
the shortages of access to social infrastructure and services to strengthen community capacity has been 
the right choice. This approach has provided a platform to implement future safety net interventions such 
as the “Cash for Work” program, which became effective in September 2008, and the Decentralized Basic 
Service Delivery Program recently been approved by the IDA Board in September, 2009. .  
55. 
In response to the 2008 food price crisis, the Bank provided additional financing to the 
NSAP to implement a “cash for work” program to support household food access and minimize the 
nutritional impact of the crisis through incremental income support. The program consists of small 
labor-intensive public works projects in rural, peri-urban, and urban areas. Participating workers receive 
weekly cash payments for their labor. Communities and local councils were involved in the decision-
making. It is expected that the “cash for work” program will benefit close to 100,000 direct and indirect 
beneficiaries including unemployed youth, female-headed households, and vulnerable rural and urban 
households. The program employed approximately 16,000 beneficiaries over 9–12 months. In addition, a 
standalone DPO of US$3 million was designed and disbursed within 2 months to ensure that key 
government programs could maintain their food-related expenditures despite higher international prices. 
As part of the program, to date, over 42,000 person-days of employment for more than 5,300 

76

 
 
 
disadvantaged people has been created, resulting in 260 km of roads rehabilitated and 85 acres of arable 
swamps and woodlands developed.  

Quality of Products and Services  

IV. Bank Performance  

56. 
The overall lending program in Sierra Leone has been consistent with the CAS objectives. 
During the CAS period, the level of financing was lower than originally envisioned, and the portfolio was 
adjusted to reflect the availability of IDA resources and the need for additional financing. These 
adjustments led to the postponement of some projects and the reevaluation of others. In addition, higher 
global fuel and food prices as well as project cost overruns made it necessary to provide additional 
financing for two operations. The Health Sector Reconstruction Project received an additional $8 million, 
and the Infrastructure Development Project (Transport) an additional $10 million. Two projects, 
Development Policy Credit (GRGC 2) and Mining TA, which originally were planned for the CAS 
period, have been postponed to FY10. GRGC 2 was postponed by one year in response to slippages in the 
macroeconomic performance and certain conditionalities. The mining TA was postponed to allow for 
additional discussions with the new government.  
57. 
IDA 14 resources have been fully utilized during FY06–08with 5 financing operations for a 
total of approximately US$103 million. Of this amount, approximately 55 percent has been for 
infrastructure, $30 million for rural and private sector development, 10 percent for health, and 10 percent 
for development policy lending operations. 
58. 
Implementation of the CAS program was hampered by the election period and change in 
government. The elections resulted in a change in government to the opposition party. This transition had 
implications for policy approaches and preferences and thus delayed the implementation of some 
programs. The new government took approximately one year to complete the transition. In addition, the 
incoming administration lacked experience in managing projects and had to build relationships with the 
development partners. Furthermore, the government faced challenges in budget forecasting, management, 
and record-keeping, which undermined its case with donors for development policy lending.  
59. 
A significant amount of multi-donor trust fund (TF) resources were used to finance 
development programs that are consistent with CAS objectives. These included US$25 million for 
decentralization and capacity building from a trust fund provided by DfID and EU; US$10 million for 
water provided by DfID; US$30 million from the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF) for the 
Reproductive and Child Health Project; and US$15 million for Education from EFA-FTI. In addition, 
smaller 
trust funds (CHYAO, Gates Foundation) supported engagement 
in community-driven 
development. Recent Food Price Crisis Response operations were financed from the Global Food Price 
Crisis Trust Fund.

60. 
The Bank carried out an ambitious analytical program during the CAS period, but 
dissemination has been limited. Appendix 3 shows the broad range of Analytical and Advisory 
Assistance (AAA) undertaken by the Bank. Analytical activity has been strongest under Pillar 2: 
Sustainable Growth, Food Security, and Job Creation. This strength may be attributable to the lending 
activity under this pillar having been the most challenging. While the election process and subsequent 
changes in government have significantly handicapped the lending program, the economic and sector 
work (ESW) program has continued unabated. Thus, FY08 was an extremely important year for AAA in 
framing the policy dialogue in Sierra Leone. However, it was not always possible to sequence the Bank’s 
work in time for lending operations and, in some instances, there was not enough emphasis from the Bank 
or engagement from government to disseminate AAA work. Some of the AAA work (CEM, PER) had to 
be postponed due to the Bank’s resource constraints and the government’s capacity. Due to the change in 
government, it was difficult to assess the impact of AAA work on the government’s action and policy 
dialogue during the CAS period.  
Portfolio Performance 

61. 
The quality of the portfolio has been mixed. During the CAS period, Sierra Leone’s portfolio 
grew and matured. However, the quality of the portfolio deteriorated, and the percentage of projects at 
risk now stands at 50 percent and includes 3 of the total of 8 IDA projects. The three projects rated as 
problem projects are the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Environmental and Social Management Specific 

78

 
 
 
 
Investment Loan (SIL), the Power and Water SIL, and the Rural and Private Sector Development SIL. 
Problems include lack of counterpart funding, weak monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems, 
procurement issues, and slow disbursement. The Bumbuna Hydroelectric Environmental and Social 
Management SIL and Power and Water SIL suffered from weak capacity within the designated ministries 
and agencies. This lack of capacity resulted in a lack of coordination in implementation of project 
components. Furthermore, the Rural Private Sector Development SIL became effective more than one 
year after approval.

Based on consultation with the Bank task team and government, a review of Sierra Leone’s 
latest Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) for FY08 identified six factors that affected 
implementation and results: (1) ambitious and complex project design, (2) lack of leadership and 
ownership within the implementing agencies, (3) low institutional capacity in PIUs and line ministries, 
(4) inadequate monitoring and evaluation, (5) lack of timely availability of counterpart funds, and (6) 
excessive use of high-paid international consultants. Although various projects appear well structured in 
terms of design and alignment of resources to areas of need, sustainability remains questionable because 
of concerns about shortage of human and capital resources. Implementation constraints (mainly in 
financial management and delays in procurement and submission of withdrawal applications) have 
created substantial delays in disbursement. The Bank actively addressed the key CPPR findings with the 
new government and administration staff in 2008.  
63. 
QAG assessments of portfolios. The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) assessed 6 of the 9 
projects in Sierra Leone during FY06–09. Three projects had been assessed in a Quality at Entry 
Assessment (QEA), two projects in a Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA), and two projects for 
Quality of Lending Portfolio (QALP) (table 3). Most of these projects have been rated as satisfactory to 
moderately satisfactory, and one project was rated as highly satisfactory. The only exception was the 
Power and Water Project, which was rated as moderately unsatisfactory.  
64. 
Findings from the QEA of two projects showed that, for the Rural Development and Private 
Sector Development Project, the Bank had made the right choice in being selective and focusing on 
agricultural marketing. This is the area in which the Bank has comparative advantage with experience in 
successful marketing projects. The National Social Action Project was rated satisfactory with a number of 
outstanding features that are best practice in the context of post-conflict. The QAG recommended that, for 
post-conflict projects such as this, (1) a long-term linkage and coordination with the decentralization 
program in the country should be established, and (2) the primary focus should be to strengthen the link 
between local communities and their local governments or state institutions.  
65. 
The QAG assessed the supervision (QSA) of the Institutional Reform Credit Project. The 
supervision was rated highly satisfactory citing the Bank’s team consistent flexibility, energy, creativity, 
and responsiveness to implementation challenges in a complex post-conflict environment.  

79

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
66. 
The QAG recently assessed the quality of lending portfolio (QALP) of two important 
infrastructure projects. The Bumbuna Hydroelectric Environment and Social Management Project has 
been a challenging operation carried out in a post-conflict environment with weak capacity. The QAG 
recommends that, in preparing a complex operation of this type, in addition to assessing safeguards and 
the reputational risk for the Bank, the Bank must ensure that project planning accommodates these 
additional challenges. In the Power and Water Project, QAG highlights the important challenges that the 
Bank can encounter when working in a post-conflict situation while noting the need to remain engaged.

IEG evaluations of ICRs: During the CAS period, four Bank projects were closed. 
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) were prepared for all four and were reviewed by the 
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). Table 4 presents the results of both the completed ICRs and the 
IEG ratings. Overall, the project ratings were mixed, with approximately 1 satisfactory, 2 moderately 
satisfactory, and 1 moderately unsatisfactory. For lessons learned, IEG indicated that (1) project design 
needs to be tailored to country context, and (2) when a project is restructured in a post-conflict country, 
the project objectives need to be redefined to reflect what can be achieved. Moreover, a realistic timetable 
to implement sector reforms needs to be developed taking into account the current country situation and 
local capacity constraints.

Aid Coordination and Harmonization The Bank worked effectively with the development 
partners. The Bank worked closely with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the UK Department for 
International Development (DfID), the European Union (EU) and the United Nations agencies, during the 
preparation of the CAS. The Bank continues to work closely with these organizations and others, such as 
GTZ/KFW, the Government of Italy, Irish Aid, and JICA, to implement development assistance. 

69. 
The Budget Support Donors46 including the Bank have agreed on a Framework for Multi-
Donor Budget Support (MDBS) backed by a Progress Assessment Framework (PAF). The PAF is 
fully consistent with the PRS. The former sets out clear goals, benchmarks, monitorable indicators, and 
areas of responsibility for the government and for each donor. Annual progress toward PAF benchmarks 
has been generally adequate. In addition, the IMF and the Bank collaborated closely during the CAS 
period to assist the government in implementing the PRS, coordinating as to the structural and policy 
reforms for advice on sector economic questions, and identifying solutions for the government.  
International Finance Corporation 

70. 
IFC’s strategy in Sierra Leone during the CAS period was guided by the Conflict-Affected 
Countries Strategy. IFC has been working with the Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) 
supported by MIGA and the Private Enterprise Partnership for Africa (PEP Africa) to continue to improve 
the investment climate through a joint program with UK’s DfID focused on improving the legal and 
regulatory environment. A complementary program supports the Sierra Leone Business Forum––a 
platform to facilitate dialogue between the government and the private sector. FIAS also assisted with 
some aspects of tax policy and with investment and export promotion.  
71. 
IFC provided support to the Commonwealth Business Council in organizing the Private 
Sector Forum in 2008. IFC also is working with IDA to support the Bank of Sierra Leone in setting up a 
Credit Reference Bureau. In 2007 under the Global Trade Finance Program, IFC signed credit facilities 
with three banks: Sierra Leone Commercial Bank, Rokel Commercial Bank, and Guaranty Trust Bank. In 
addition, IFC announced investment in the telecommunications sector in Celtel Sierra Leone to help

IFC partnered with KfW of Germany to support the establishment of Procredit Sierra 
Leone, a microfinance institution. IFC will provide equity and debt financing as well as a TA grant. The 
company already started operations, and IFC’s investment was originally expected to be completed by the 
end of 2008, but is still in progress. In addition, to reach small farmers and rural enterprises, IFC will 
work more with trading companies and financial intermediaries, helping to effectively channel financing

73. MIGA’s portfolio in Sierra Leone during the CAS period consisted of 1 project in support 
of the country’s services sector, with a remaining gross exposure of US$5.0 million. Contracts for this 
investment were signed under the agency’s Small Investment Program (SIP). The project, financed by 
investors from the United Kingdom, provides container scanning services and port security compliance 
advice for the ports of Freetown, Nitti, and Kissy. The project will help the country comply with new 
international security requirements and should facilitate exports from Sierra Leone to international 
markets.  

Regional Integration 

74. 
During the CAS period, the Bank supported Sierra Leone’s effort to embrace regional 
integration as one element of its reconstruction through its active membership in the Economic 
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Mano River Union. It was the first member 
outside the West African Economic Monetary Union (WAEMU) to adopt the ECOWAS Common 
External Tariff (CET) which is based on the WAEMU tariff. Sierra Leone is actively participating in a 
number of regional initiatives under preparation. One, the West Africa Fisheries Project, supports 
collaborative efforts among nine West Africa countries to reduce illegal fishing, strengthen countries’ 
capacity to govern and manage their fisheries, and increase the value and profitability of this resource as 
well as the proportion captured by local fishermen. Another, the West Africa Regional Mineral Sector 
Initiative, seeks to improve governments’ capacity to manage their minerals sectors transparently and 
efficiently and to facilitate regional harmonization and coordination in the development of the mining 
sector within the Mano River Union.  

What Worked Well:  

V. Lessons Learned 

75. 

In general, the Bank assistance contributed to development progress in Sierra Leone during the 
CAS period, but only some CAS outcomes were achieved. The following section highlights positive 
achievements in a number of areas.  
76. 
Improvements in the decentralization agenda have been viable during the CAS period. The 
Bank’s contribution has helped to build a solid foundation for the fiscal transfer system, which is in place. 
Local councils’ capacity in participatory planning, budgeting, financial management, procurement, and 
project 
implementation developed rapidly––as a result of 
intensive 
training and monitoring. 
Decentralization stimulated PFM reforms. The former was driven largely by the Bank’s team and the 
government’s commitment to reform supported by donors. However, challenges remain, particularly 
related to the overall shortage of professionals in the post-conflict country, ability of local councils to 
attract and retain staff, high dependence on central government transfers, traditional authorities’ lack of 
commitment to reform, and lack of leadership of the reform process.  
Reforms in the public financial management framework and system have been effective. 
The Bank’s support has helped to provide a solid platform in the PFM system that supports fiscal 
discipline, effective allocation of money, and improved predictability. This platform will help to support 
the next phase of PFM reforms within an integrated program, which will ensure sustainability and 
consolidation of reforms.  

77. 

82

 
 
 
 
 
 
78. 

Community-driven development initiatives have empowered communities to manage their 
own development. Given Sierra Leone’s post-conflict environment, the community-based approach to 
address inadequate access to social infrastructure services has been the right choice. In addition, the 
Bank’s involvement improved decentralization and capacity building within the local governments and 
strengthened public financial management. This has provided a foundation for improving service 
delivery. In future interventions, the Bank should focus on how it can engage at the grassroots level and 
institutionalize community participation in planning, implementation, and monitoring local development 
interventions.  
79. 
Development policy lending helped to improve policy reforms in certain areas. At the same 
time, due to the macroeconomic framework, there have been recent slippages, which delayed the second 
development policy lending operations (GRGC-2). Given that development policy lending depends on a 
stable macroeconomic environment, this kind of support is quite volatile in a country such as Sierra 
Leone, which has a limited IDA envelope. Therefore, the Bank followed a balanced approached 
emphasizing project support when development policy lending might not be as effective. For example, for 
service-delivery, project support may be a better instrument to smooth out expenditures on basic services.  

What Worked Less Well:  

81. 

80. 
Improving governance issues in infrastructure development was less successful during the 
CAS period. Improving infrastructure made less progress and remains a key impediment to a better 
investment climate and delivery of basic social services. While the Bank was committed to improve 
infrastructure (energy, transport, and water), weak governance contributed to limited results. Thus, 
substantial gaps remain. The CAS implementation showed that, due to entrenched vested interests, 
governance reforms in power and roads are complicated. While some progress has been made, the Bank 
should incorporate a more positive and strategic approach to governance. The Bank should unbundle 
governance issues to implementable levels and seek more in-depth understanding of causal factors. 
Furthermore, quality and coverage of service delivery could be strengthened through additional work in 
PFM, decentralization, and direct support for basic service delivery.  
Complex and unrealistic project design led to slower implementation. During the review 
period, it was noticed that the design of some projects was too complex with too many subcomponents, 
large geographic coverage, and numerous implementing agencies involved. These complications resulted 
in poor performance and implementation delays. Multisectoral initiatives such as the Rural and Private 
Sector Development Project increased institutional tensions and diffused accountability. The limited 
administrative capacity in a fragile state setting is still binding in Sierra Leone and needs to be taken into 
account. Future project designs should be simpler, align with implementation capacity, and avoid 
overburdening projects with ambitious objectives and outcomes.  
82. 
The political transition affected CAS implementation both before and after the election, 
particularly due to change in ministry staff. The election period and change of government (from the 
ruling party to the opposition) undoubtedly impacted on the implementation of the CAS more than had 
been anticipated. The democratic elections were an important milestone in Sierra Leone’s transition from 
a post-conflict to a democratic country. Nevertheless, the transition brought with it some “transaction 
costs” in loss of capacity within the government and delays in the formulation of policies. In addition, 
many new ministries and their staff were new and needed time to understand and/or agree with all aspects 
of the reforms financed by the donor community. The Bank will seek to mitigate, this risk in the future, 
by broadening and deepening its outreach on development policy to the government, and other 
stakeholders.  
83. 
For better monitoring and evaluation, focus on fewer monitorable outcomes and greater 
availability of baseline data. The FY06 CAS set out too many outcomes and multiple indicators that 

83

 
 
 
were not monitorable. This tangle made it necessary to revise the results framework of the CAS at the 
time of CASPR.  
84. 
Capacity issues need to be taken into consideration during project preparation and 
implementation. Low institutional capacity seemed to delay project implementation and reduce the 
likelihood of achieving project objectives and CAS outcomes. Therefore, project preparation must take 
into account the government’s capacity, and only projects that are ready for implementation should 
proceed.  
85. 
 Fragile states require more intensive interactions between government and World Bank 
staff during preparation and supervision. There is a need to help government to track progress, address 
bottlenecks, and adjust to delay in program implementation. The experience during Sierra Leone’s CAS 
period shows that government commitment to certain reforms contributed positively to some CAS 
outcomes (PFM, decentralization). At the same time, government’s difficulties in dealing with politically 
sensitive issues on some reforms (power, transport, agriculture) led to slower CAS implementation than 
expected.

Lessons learned 

Satisfactory progress has been made 
towards inclusive, effective, and 
accountable local governance. All 19 
LCs should be able to maintain and 
coverage and quality of services. .  

When responsibilities and funds were 
given to LCs with intensive support 
quality of public work and service 
delivery improved. Decentralization 
liberated suppressed capacity and was 
most enthusiastically embraced by 
local officials.

Lagging performance of power utility 
sector has been disappointing. Bank 
needs to look into options of how to 
improve overall power distribution 
and access – possibility of channeling 
assistance outside of NPA and 
Ministry of Energy until major 
improvements are made in those two 
entities.  

In road sector, SLRA need to involve 
local councils and other stakeholders 
into dialogue.  

 161 km of community access 
roads have been completed; an 
additional 35 km yet to be

connecting feeder roads to main 
roads in selected districts. 
However, not all main roads are 
impassable.  
 Power generation for Freetown

Appendix 12: Country Financing Parameters 

The country financing parameters (AfDB policy of eligible expenditure) for the Republic of Sierra 
Leone (RSL) are set out below. These parameters will be reviewed on an approximately bi-annual 
basis, and when the next IDA assistance strategy is prepared. 

Item 

Parameter

Remarks/Explanation 

Cost sharing 
Limit on the proportion of individual 
project costs that IDA may finance 

100% 

Recurrent-cost financing 
Any limits that would apply to the overall 
amount of recurrent expenditures that IDA 
may finance. 

No country 
level limit.  

The Bank will seek GoSL counterpart funding and 
will promote harmonization 
through 
seeking 
cofinancing for all projects. Nonetheless, there may 
be projects in which the Bank may finance up to 
100% of project costs. Financing at this level will be 
applied after a selective and case-by-case review of 
justification. Typically, projects executed by GoSL 
entities with own sources of income (such as ports 
or power) are expected to include counterpart 
funding contributions. Projects that may be financed 
up to 100% include those that support social sector 
development, governance, and capacity building. 

IDA, working closely with the IMF, would monitor 
the 
fiscal 
adjustment program, 
and public 
expenditure management and public sector reforms 
to ensure that recurrent cost financing is embedded 
in 
a 
credible 
and 
sustainable government 
macroeconomic strategy. 
In determining 
IDA 
financing of recurrent costs in individual projects, 
the agency will take into account sustainability 
issues at the sector and project levels, including 
consideration of implied future budgetary outlays. 
To ensure sustainability, especially for capacity 
building, projects that include financing for staff 
costs will need to be accompanied by explicit 
agreement that GoSL will assume the cost of 
permanent positions after the Bank contribution to 
the project is completed. 

Performance based incentive programs for civil 
servants may be financed on a clear time bound 
basis, provided that such programs are consistent 
with, and feed into, the government’s public sector 
reform program and are applicable to all donor-
funded programs. 

Local-cost financing 
Are the requirements for IDA financing of 
local expenditures met, namely that: (1) 
financing requirements for the country’s 

Yes 

The two requirements are met. IDA may finance 
local costs in the proportions needed by individual 
projects.  

106

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Parameter

Remarks/Explanation 

Item 
development program would exceed the 
public 
sector’s own 
resources 
(for 
example, 
from 
taxation 
and 
other 
revenues) 
and 
expected 
domestic 
borrowing; and (2) the financing of foreign 
expenditures alone would not enable IDA 
to adequately assist in the financing of 
individual projects? 

Taxes and duties 
Are there any taxes and duties that the 
IDA would not finance? 

None 

Taxes and duties are considered reasonable. The 
application of this general approach will be subject 
to an ongoing monitoring of tax policy and how 
taxes are applied to IDA projects. At the project 
level, IDA would consider whether taxes and duties 
constitute an excessively high share of projects 
costs.

Appendix 13: Consultations in Preparation for the Joint Assistance Strategy of the AfDB, 
WB, and IFC for Sierra Leone 

A consultation mission with stakeholders at the government and community levels was carried out in 
Freetown in January 2009 to discuss and validate the strategic directions.  
In June 2009, the Government of Sierra Leone launched the country’s second-generation PRSP under 
the name, Agenda for Change. PRSP-II spells out the vision, direction, and development priorities of 
the government. Since then, The World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), and International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) have been working on a Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) to support the 
new PRSP. The preparations started in January, well in advance of the completion of the PRSP, and 
included several rounds of consultations and feedback. They were concluded in September 2009.  
The consultation series were organized as follows: 
a. 
Client survey, which yielded 340 responses from a broad segment of respondents 
b. 
Opening consultations in Freetown, led by the government, with participation from civil 
society, government ministries and agencies, representatives of local government, development 
partners, private sector, and the press 
c. 
Technical consultations, involving primarily staff of the AfDB, WB, and IFC, but also 
selected external partners 
d. 
Regional consultations held in four key provincial towns––Makeni, Koidu, Kenema, 
and Bo––for a broad dialogue on people’s wishes and hopes for the PRSP and JAS, soliciting 
grassroots feedback on priorities 
e. 
Thematic consultations with civil society, ministries, agencies, local government, 
development partners, private sector, and media on key priorities and issues of concerning 
i. 
Youth employment 
ii. 
Gender 
iii. 
Governance  
iv. 
Agriculture 
f. 
Concluding/validation consultations held in Freetown, led by GoSL, attended by civil 
society, government ministries and agencies, local councils, development partners, private 
sector, and media. 
In total, close to 1000 participants attended consultation meetings. 
1. Client Survey 
The World Bank conducted a national client survey to prepare for its participation in the JAS. The 
outcomes also provided valuable insights for the other JAS partners. A questionnaire was sent to 700 
individuals, of whom 365 responded. Questions addressed views of development priorities for the 
country and the role of the World Bank. In general, the World Bank was viewed positively by 
respondents and seen as responsive to the needs of the country. A notable change for the client survey 
for the previous CAS was a significant increase in the emphasis on governance and calls for 
determined anticorruption efforts in new government and donor strategies. 
2. Opening Consultations 

The opening consultations workshop was held in Freetown, January 21–23. One hundred and thirty-
five participants attended the workshop, which was chaired by the Minister of Finance.  

108

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Opening session. With interventions from the three JAS partners, the Governor of the Central Bank 
gave an overview of the GoSL’s expectation of the new JAS and the partnership with the JAS partner 
organizations. Specific session over the three days included discussions of:

3. Technical Consultations 

Following the opening consultations, the JAS preparation team organized a series of five technical 
workshops that included AfDB, IFC, and WB staff connected by videoconference. They discussed 
sector issues, selection of priority interventions, and challenges to be addressed in selection and 
implementation. 

4. Regional Consultations 

When GoSL had published its final version of the Agenda for Change/PRSP-II, the JAS preparation 
team organized a series of regional consultations to hear from stakeholders around the country. The 
team presented the draft JAS, and solicited feedback on the JAS priorities and how they fit with the 
PRSP and people’s aspirations. One-day consultation meetings were held in the towns of Makeni, 
Koidu, Kenema, and Bo. All meetings were very well attended (typically 150 people per meeting) and 
represented a broad segment of the local population. The meeting consisted of introductions to the new 
PRSP, an introduction of the proposed JAS, solicitation of views on sectors, issues, and approaches; 
and a dialogue between JAS team members and the audience, in all cases moderated by a local 
moderator of some standing. Among views that enjoyed broad support and frequent expression were: 
 Agriculture is of primary importance. GoSL and JAS partners should do more to encourage 
agricultural production and post-harvest activities. Feeder-road conditions are a major concern 
in agriculture. 
 Concerns over transparency and accountability were widely expressed and touched on issues in 
all sectors, not least health and education.

5. Thematic Consultations 

Partly associated with the regional consultations, the JAS partners organized thematic consultations on 
four key issues: gender equality, youth employment, governance, and agriculture. 

 The gender equality discussion showed that most participants regard economic empowerment 
of women as the key path toward equality. Issues such as maternal health, education, and 
cultural barriers and pressures also were raised by many, as was the issue of women’s 
participation in public works schemes. 
 The youth employment discussion again highlighted the importance of agriculture as the basis 
for job creation. Calls were made for innovative programs to support youth employment, public 
works schemes, vocational training, and attention to the issues facing young unemployed 
women, often also mothers. The need for more transparency in the distribution of benefits from 
mining, combined with calls for work to mitigate the environmental damage done by mining 
was raised by many. 
 Many in the governance consultations raised attention to governance concerns in the 
preparation of development projects. Broad concerns were raised over abuse of power and 
diversion of resources to private use. Sale of essential medicines and charging for access to 
basic healthcare were strong concerns, as was the issue of teacher absenteeism and capacity. 
The regional distribution of public resources was another concern. CSOs made a strong case for 
vigorous grassroots engagement to ensure transparency in resource use. 
In agriculture, there were calls for more and equitable support to farmers’ organizations, such 
as cooperatives; more support for inputs and implements; and post-harvest processing and 
marketing. Opportunities for young people to get started in agriculture were raised by many as 
a concern.

6. Concluding/Validation Consultations 
The final consultation round was held in Freetown on September 10. The workshop was chaired by the 
deputy minister of finance. As before, it included ministers, government officials, heads of government 
agencies, development partners, CSOs, private sector, and the media. 

The workshop discussed the draft JAS in light of the final PRSP and the series of consultations 
undertaken since the opening Consultation Workshop. The main conclusions of the workshop can be 
summarized as follows: 
 The consultations reconfirm that the PRSP-II priorities resonate with the general population.  
 Agriculture comes through as the top priority in the eyes of the public. Feeder roads 
investments also enjoy very broad support, more so in rural areas. Electrification rates high as a 
priority, and more so in urban areas. Using resources for health and education enjoys broad 
support, but there are widespread concerns about quality and governance issues. Mining is very 
frequently described in quite negative terms. 
 Economic empowerment of women comes across as the number-one gender issue. 
 Concerns about governance and corruption were expressed at every meeting, often 
passionately. Specific concerns were abuse of power by authorities, both official and 
traditional; resources being diverted; essential drugs being sold illegally; access to basic health 
care denied by demands for payments; and teachers frequently being absent. 
 Private-sector-led growth always is seen as the key to economic progress. The main economic 
potential is seen in agriculture. 

110

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Youth unemployment is broadly seen as a key threat to peace and stability, in addition to the 
welfare and growth arguments raised. Innovative youth employment schemes and training are 
emerging as key challenges. 
 All meetings, including the validation workshop, broadly ratified the priorities and approaches 
proposed in the draft JAS as being right and relevant.
