EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
It has been nearly two decades since FYR Macedonia’s 1991 independence. The country 
has made important progress in many areas of social and economic development.  Under the 
2001 Ohrid Agreement, the Government chose a peaceful solution to ethnic conflict and, 
notwithstanding periods of tension, has maintained constructive political dialogue and social 
stability. Successive governments of differing political parties have largely pursued prudent 
macroeconomic management, which has contributed to gradually accelerating economic growth and 
helped the country weather the 2008-2009 global economic crisis.  FYR Macedonia performs well on 
indices of business climate and, most promising, is nearing European Union (EU) accession.  
Improvements in social and human development have been less consistent, but people are living 
longer, fewer infants are dying, more children are going to school, and women are taking their 
rightful place in social and political life.  
ii. 
There are, however, enduring and emerging challenges.  First, economic growth in FYR 
Macedonia picked-up later than in much of South East Europe and only reached regional averages at 
the outset of the 2008 economic and financial crisis.  Second, while growth in output accelerated in 
the pre-crisis years, it did not significantly improve living standards.  Unemployment is notably high 
and falling slowly, and poverty remains persistently high. In this context, establishing faster, more 
inclusive growth remains the preeminent challenge. Turbulence in Greece and the eurozone 
underscores this point.  Third, evidence is mounting that South East Europe—and FYR Macedonia 
specifically—confronts growing climate pressures that could fundamentally affect its economic 
development.  Growth, therefore, needs to be “greener” as well as faster and more inclusive. 
iii. 
The authorities are committed to meeting these challenges. The Government has 
established clear goals beginning with, above all, faster economic growth and job creation.  The 
authorities have also defined a roadmap for swift EU accession, continued “social harmony,” 
transformation into a knowledge economy, and, ultimately, a higher quality of life for all citizens, 
including a focus on the response to climate change. 
iv. 
The World Bank Group’s objective over the FY 2011-2014 is to provide selective and 
targeted financing and knowledge advisory services in support of faster, more inclusive and 
greener economic growth.  Because FYR Macedonia’s future growth and development will depend 
fundamentally on the pace of EU accession, virtually every intervention in this CPS has been 
identified and will be designed to help prepare for EU membership. 

 Faster growth by improving competitiveness.  FYR Macedonia can build on improvements 
in the business climate through continued sound macroeconomic management, further efforts 
to reduce bottlenecks in the business environment and infrastructure, and stepped-up 
investments in education, including higher education.   

 More inclusive growth by strengthening employability and social protection.  The CPS 
will emphasize continued improvement of social programs amid growing fiscal constraints. 

 Greener growth through more sustainable resource use.  Key Bank Group interventions 
will include “win-win” investments in clean and efficient energy.  As this is an emerging area 
of knowledge and new subject of dialogue with the Government, the Bank will also 
collaborate with selected partners of FYR Macedonia on analysis on “green growth” and 
climate change to support adaptation and other climate sensitive policymaking. 

i 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
v. 

World Bank Group support will be guided by three principles of engagement.  
 Assistance will be directed to support EU accession;  

 

Interventions will seek to leverage financing and expertise from within the World Bank 
Group and across FYR Macedonia’s development partners; 
 CPS implementation will be flexible, reflecting the pace of economic recovery and the 
external environment; emerging development challenges, including evolving knowledge on 
the impacts of global climate change; and the demand of government authorities. 
vi. 
The CPS is consistent with the Bank Group’s regional strategy for Europe and Central 
Asia (ECA).  It identifies the challenges and priorities in the ECA Strategy and adapts them to the 
circumstances in FYR Macedonia; and it supports expanding regional and sub-regional approaches, 
deepening the partnership with the EU, and aligning knowledge services to support country priorities. 
vii. 
The Bank will accelerate consolidation of the portfolio to achieve a lending program of 
fewer, larger projects.  This will help free budget resources to identify and carry out timely, demand 
driven analytical products that influence policy and leverage results.  The Bank Group has engaged 
closely with the authorities to identify sectors where it can concentrate its assistance and maximize 
impact.  This will be especially important given that International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD) lending is relatively small and increasingly selective. 

viii. The total volume of new IBRD commitments under the CPS over FY11 and FY12 is 
expected to amount to a little over US$100 million.  The Government has asked for a total envelope 
that would imply lending of similar amounts over FY13 and FY14.  Overall lending amounts will depend 
on the IBRD's lending capacity and demand by other borrowers as well as Government demand and 
performance in the course of the CPS period. The lending program for the last two years of the CPS will 
be discussed with the authorities closer to the time of the CPS mid-term Review.  The CPS includes 

US$30 million for the second operation of a Programmatic Development Policy Lending (DPL). 
Additional policy based budget support may follow during the CPS period depending upon 
Government priorities and a continued satisfactory macroeconomic framework.  Investment 
operations are planned initially in the energy sector and toward catastrophic risk mitigation.  The 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) expects to provide financing to the private sector of up to 
US$100 million.  IFC’s investments will aim to improve competitiveness, address climate change 
issues, and facilitate intermediation in the country.  IFC will use its Public-Private Partnership 
Transaction Advisory to facilitate private financing for public private partnerships (PPP) transactions 
for new hydro power generation facilities, road operation and maintenance, water supply, and solid 
waste management.  In addition, IFC will provide its advisory support to further improve the 
investment climate in line with country’s overall EU accession aspirations.  
ix. 
The CPS program is subject to four principal risks.  Prolonged financial turbulence in 
neighboring Greece—and the eurozone more broadly—could restrain economic growth, which could 
in turn impact debt sustainability in the absence of further policy adjustment.  This could lead the 
authorities to delay scheduled investment operations and demand more policy lending, which would 
be subject to a continued sound macroeconomic framework.  Two, the pace of EU accession will be 
accelerated by resolution of negotiations with Greece over FYR Macedonia’s “name issue.” An 
interruption in progress toward membership could weaken public support for reforms.  Three, failure 
to create jobs could undermine Government support and increase social tensions. Four, FYR 
Macedonia is vulnerable to natural disasters, including earthquakes, and, increasingly, severe climate 
related events such as draughts and floods, which could affect Government investment priorities.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT ACHIEVEMENTS 

A. Transition and EU Accession 

1. 
FYR Macedonia is a landlocked country of two million people.  It is ethnically diverse, 
with some 65 percent of the population made up of ethnic Macedonians, 25 percent ethnic Albanians, 
4 percent ethnic Turks, and nearly three percent Roma. The country remained largely peaceful during 
the wars following the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Conflict between extreme ethnic 
Albanian armed groups and FYR Macedonian security forces broke out in March 2001, but proactive 
international intervention helped end the fighting five months later with both sides agreeing to terms 
under what has come to be known as the Ohrid Framework Agreement. The main elements of this 
Agreement provided for greater devolution of political authority to local communities, equitable 
representation of minorities in the public administration as well as mechanisms to protect minorities’ 
interests in the legislative process. Nearly 10 years later the Ohrid Framework continues to provide 
the basis for peace, political expression and social stability.   

The center-right Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for 

2. 
Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE) party strengthened its mandate in early 
parliamentary elections in 2008 and in presidential and local elections in 2009.  The Prime 
Minister and the President are members of the ruling party, and VMRO-DPMNE hold strong 
majorities in the national parliament and in local municipalities.  The country is on the threshold of 
EU accession; it achieved “candidate” status in 2005, and in October 2009 the European Commission 
recommended the commencement of accession negotiations. Movement toward EU membership has, 
however, been slowed pending resolution of the “name issue” with Greece.  

3. 

EU accession continues to be highly popular and remains the anchor of reform in nearly 
every area of government and public services.  The authorities are harmonizing national 
legislation with the EU acquis communautaire, with specific achievements in procurement, transport 
policy, customs union, taxation and statistics. The European Commission’s (EC) assessment from 
October 20091 notes that FYR Macedonia “has made significant progress in meeting key priorities of 
the accession partnership,” particularly related to governance and the soundness and stability of its 
political institutions.  Indeed, in a major improvement upon its 2008 report, the 2009 report notes that 
FYR Macedonia “has consolidated the functioning of its democracy and ensured the stability of 
institutions guaranteeing the rule of law and respect of fundamental rights.” Overall, legislation is 
aligning FYR Macedonian policy closer with the EU.  However, further work is essential to enhance 
administrative capacity for legislation implementation and enforcement.

B. Macro-Economic Performance and Outlook 

Pre-Crisis 

4. 
Economic performance improved considerably prior to the global crisis.  Considered a 
laggard in terms of economic growth for most of its transition period, output expanded vigorously in 
2007 and 2008 when growth averaged 5.5 percent and approached the regional average.  
5. 
Macroeconomic policies supported stability and accelerated growth and were 
complemented by structural reforms.  A historically balanced and relatively modest budget (at 
around 34 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) helped keep aggregate demand manageable and 
avoided crowding out financing for the private sector.  Monetary policy also responded adequately to 
price and foreign exchange market developments. As a result, inflation was low and stable,2 
government debt fell to below 21 percent of GDP while at around 48 percent of GDP external debt 
remained moderate. Structural reforms were also advanced. Fees and charges were reduced, 
procedures eliminated, and labor relations overhauled, while reforms in the judiciary and cadastre 
improved creditor and property rights. Tax policy and administration reforms reduced the fiscal 
burden while strengthening public finances.  Sound banking regulation and supervision contributed 
to keeping risks manageable while stronger competition reduced the cost of finance. 

Impact of the crisis 

6. 
Prudent macroeconomic policies and complementary reforms helped FYR Macedonia 
weather the global crisis better than most countries in the region.  In response to a collapse in 
demand for exports and reduced private capital flows, fiscal policy turned countercyclical while 
monetary policy was tightened to alleviate reserve pressures.  As a result, in 2009 output contracted 
by only 0.5 percent, the fiscal deficit was 2.6 percent of GDP (among the lowest in ECA) and the 
current account deficit narrowed from 2008 by 4.2 percentage points to 8 percent of GDP.  The 
impact of the crisis on living standards also appears to be moderate. 
7. 
The Government’s response was generally sound.  The authorities carried out a sizable 
fiscal stimulus in late 2008 and increased the 2009 target deficit, in line with sustainable liquidity and 
longer-term solvency indicators.  As in neighboring countries, budget revenues fell from 33.1 percent 
of GDP in 2008 to 31 percent in 2009.  The authorities responded by trimming expenditures to meet 
the deficit target.  Additional measures were taken to mitigate the impacts of the crisis, including 
extending profit tax exemptions, implementing a major payroll reform, and supporting access to 
finance for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) by securing a credit line from the European 
Investment Bank (EIB) in the amount of 100 million Euro.  The National Bank tightened policies to 
stop the outflow of foreign exchange reserves and protect the currency peg. 

8. 
Though growth turned positive in the last quarter of 2009, data for 2010 suggest 
recovery will be gradual and tentative.  GDP contracted by 0.9 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in the 
first quarter of 2010.  Despite some rebound in external demand, domestic spending remained slack 
as households faced weak labor markets and investors remained cautious.  Still, indicators of 
economic activity (e.g., industrial production, tax collection, private sector credit, volume of 
transactions, electricity consumption, etc.) improved significantly by mid-2010. 

2 Inflation did pick-up somewhat in late 2007 and early 2008 as a result of the surge in world prices of food and 
energy, but declined once the shock receded.

Outlook over the CPS period 

9. 
The economy is projected to grow by 2 percent in 2010—but risks remain significant.  
The 2010 budget deficit target has been reduced slightly to 2.5 percent of GDP.  In fact, cuts to 
wages and services have made room for higher subsidies, transfers, and investments.  With revenues 
underperforming at the start of 2010, the authorities adopted a supplemental budget in June cutting 
expenditures by around 1.2 percent of GDP to meet this revised target. Since end-2009, the Central 
Bank has gradually reduced the intervention rate from 9 to 4.5 percent, and credit to the private 
sector has picked up somewhat.  Exports and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) recovered modestly as 
major trading partners returned to growth (with the exception of Greece), though the recent gains 
may prove short-lived if risks materialize.

10. Macroeconomic policies need to remain prudent.  Gradually reducing the fiscal deficit to a 
level that stabilizes debt will ensure that fiscal policy remains accommodative to the slower growth 
environment without endangering the sustainability of public finances.  A fiscal deficit of around 1.5 

3 

 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
percent of GDP by the end of the CPS period should stabilize public debt and put it on a declining 
trajectory.  Improving the structure of public spending is also a key area for improvement and will 
require strong commitment, given rigid spending patterns and declining revenues linked to the 
ongoing payroll reform.  Under the baseline scenario of gradual recovery, a carefully managed 
budget and strong reforms, a coordinated further loosening of monetary policy might also be 
possible, though with the NBRM’s intervention rate already reduced to 4.5 percent the scope for 
further reduction is limited.  

11. 
Recovery of investments will be critical.  The prospects for private investment, especially 
FDI, will be boosted by closer EU integration and associated reforms.  Gains from reforms affecting 
the investment climate and the quality of the labor force can be particularly substantial, especially 
given the pegged exchange rate environment.  Public investments are projected to remain relatively 
high during the CPS period and help improve the competitiveness of the economy. Well designed 
policies on public-private partnerships can also crowd-in private investments.  Due to its reliance on 
domestic deposits and limited exposure to wholesale financing (90 percent loan/deposit ratio in mid-
2010), the banking sector remains sound with strong liquidity and capital adequacy indicators and 
can support growth by providing improved access to credit for the private sector. 

Debt Sustainability 

12. 
The external balance is expected to improve.  The current account deficit is projected to 
fall to below 6 percent of GDP in 2010, widen slightly in 2011 as domestic demand recovers and 
gradually decline afterwards.  Exports should grow as major trading partners recover, while imports 
are expected to rebound more slowly, partly due to fiscal consolidation over the medium term.  
Private transfers will remain significant as EU-integration increases labor mobility3. Financing 
requirements are projected to be around 10 percent of GDP on average during the CPS period with 
the current account deficit averaging around 6 percent of GDP.  Amortization is expected to add 
around 3 percent of GDP to financing requirements while an increase in reserves of around 1 percent 
of GDP is expected to be needed to ensure that reserves continue to provide a comfortable coverage 
of 4-5 months of imports of goods and services.   

13. 
The external financing requirements are not excessive, but macroeconomic policies may 
need to be adjusted in case capital inflows underperform.  The 10 percent of GDP needed to meet 
the financing requirements is projected to come primarily from FDI (accounting for 4 percent of 
GDP on average) as delayed investments are undertaken and new investors enter the market and from 
disbursements on debt instruments, which are expected to provide around 6 percent of GDP—of 
which around half will be from issuance of public debt (Table 2).  While a considerable part of public 
borrowing will be from official sources (EBRD, EIB, IBRD, etc.), the authorities plan to finance a 
significant part of the fiscal deficit by issuing debt on private international capital markets. If 
reemerging financing risks keep borrowing terms unfavorable (see Box 1) a tightening of 
macroeconomic policies may be required in order to limit the financing requirements. 

14. 
Public and external debt should remain sustainable. General government debt is projected 
to peak at 29 percent of GDP by 2012.  Still, the move from concessional to commercial creditors 
will increase interest expenditures and shorten maturity.  Gross external debt is projected to reach 

3 Still, a larger increase is unlikely given that labor markets are expected to remain stagnant over the next few years 
in the most frequent migrant destinations.

60.5 percent of GDP in 2010 and then gradually decline.  Most debt is in favorable longer-term loans 
to the public sector or FDI-related transactions and small exposure to wholesale financing.  No major 
deterioration in debt servicing indicators is expected, though large repayments in 2012 and 2015 
indicate increased roll-over risks.

The risks to this scenario remain considerable.  Stronger growth will depend on continued 
recovery in FYR Macedonia’s main trading partners and investors responding to an improved 
business environment.  So far, the European fiscal and debt crisis appears to have had only limited 
impact on financial conditions and economic activity in the country.  FYR Macedonia has important 
economic links with Greece (see Box 1), and to a lesser extent with more exposed countries such as 
Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal.  A loss of confidence resulting from a significant deterioration in 
the five most-exposed EU countries, though unlikely, risks driving FYR Macedonia’s richer trading 
partners into recession and dampening growth prospects.  Drastic domestic adjustments were 
unnecessary in FYR Macedonia as macroeconomic fundamentals were largely appropriate prior to 
the crisis.  Nonetheless, heightened uncertainty, tighter economic policies, or reduced remittances 
and capital inflows could slow or reverse growth.  Further, the analyses suggest that public debt will 
not stabilize under an extended output shock or failure to adjust the fiscal balance, and external debt 
will not stabilize if growth, exports and FDI underperform.  Public and external debt levels are 
significantly affected by the exchange rate.

Box 1: Impact of the Greek and Eurozone Sovereign Debt Crisis 

Greece is an important economic partner of FYR Macedonia, and a prolonged recession in Greece 
will negatively impact growth prospects.  To date, however, indicators suggest a relatively modest 
impact on FYR Macedonia’s economic activity.  

Greece is the second most important trading partner of FYR Macedonia.  A decline in trade so far 
in 2010 has so far been compensated for by increased trade with other countries.  Greece is also a 
major transport corridor, with foreign trade in critical FYR Macedonian products (oil, iron and steel 
etc.) largely going through the Greek port of Thessaloniki.  Prolonged closures of the port due to 
strikes will add to the costs of doing business in FYR Macedonia.  Greece’s importance as a foreign 
investor has receded in recent years though remains high.  However, risks are somewhat mitigated 
by the fact that most of the investments are from retained earnings. 

In the financial sector, two banks, including the largest bank in the country, are subsidiaries of 
Greek banking groups.  So far, risks to these two banks appear manageable.  Both banks are well-
capitalized, have sound liquidity and solvency indicators and limited exposure to mother banks and, 
according to stress-test results, should be able to withstand significant withdrawal of deposits.  
However, increased vigilance and improved coordination between key stakeholders will be needed 
in case the situation deteriorates further or is extended over a longer period. 

The increased risk perceptions due to the Greek crisis may also undermine growth prospects by 
keeping risk premiums elevated for a considerable part of the CPS period. This may lower the 
availability and increase the costs of foreign capital and require an adjustment in macroeconomic 
policies. Already, the authorities have delayed the issuance of a Eurobond amid rising risk premium 
as a result of the Greek debt crisis. 

Beyond Greece to the Eurozone more broadly, continued uncertainty related to Europe’s debt and 
fiscal crisis is expected to dampen economic growth.  According to the June 2010 Global Economic 
Prospects, the higher probability of faster tightening of policies in developed economies will 
somewhat lower global growth. This tightening may have a disproportionate impact on FYR 
Macedonia owing to its strong links with EU countries.  A major crisis of confidence, though un- 
likely, could have far-reaching consequences on growth and the global financial system.  If such a 
crisis occurred, FYR Macedonia might not be able to avoid a larger loss of output and deterioration 
in economic fundamentals. 

C. Competitiveness  

Business Environment 
16. 
FYR Macedonia has significantly strengthened its business environment.  The ranking of 
FYR Macedonia in “ease of doing business” in the 2010 World Bank Group Doing Business Report 
jumped to 32 out of 185 countries from 69 in 2009 and 92 in 2006.  In 2010, FYR Macedonia was 
recognized as the third overall “top reformer.” As a result of a new Law on Business Registration, the 
time to register a company was cut from 48 days in 2006 to 4 in 2009; and the cost to less than €50.  
Business regulation was also reduced by introducing a “Regulatory Guillotine,” which reviewed 
more than 2,000 laws and by-laws, out of which 64 laws and 482 by-laws were amended.  In 
addition, the flexibility of the labor market was increased through a new Labor Law.  

6 

 
 
 
 
17. 
The Government has significantly cut tax rates.  Corporate and personal income tax rates 
have been cut to a flat rate of 10 percent (one of the lowest rates in the ECA region) and additional 
exemptions have been introduced to reinvested profits.  These measures are designed to complement 
broader efforts underway to improve the business environment and reduce the impediments to 
investment, including ensuring FYR Macedonian labor remains competitive in Europe.  

18. 
An ambitious payroll tax reform is also underway to reduce the burden of hiring and 
retaining workers.  Indeed, the Government has made wage competitiveness and access to the EU 
market a key element of a global marketing campaign, Invest Macedonia (Figure 1).4 Part of this 
strategy was to reduce Social Insurance Contributions, which have been cut from 32.5 percent of 
gross income in 2008 to 27 percent in 2010.  Reaching the target of 22.5 percent during the CPS 
period will depend on the fiscal outcomes during recovery.  Payroll tax reforms have been carried out 
while managing fiscal implications by expanding the tax base, harmonizing income bases for social 
security, and moving from a net wage to a gross wage basis for calculating contributions.  These 
reforms are having positive effects on the labor market in general, and for unskilled and younger 
workers in particular.  In fact, labor participation has jumped by five percentage points since 2004.  

Figure 1. Wage Competitiveness 

19. 
The country has strengthened its real estate market and courts.  Reforms in the real 
estate cadastre have resulted in the coverage of 99 percent of the territory; nearly tripled the number 
of mortgages; doubled the number of registered transactions; and shortened the period for transaction 
registration. Seventy percent of all transactions are now registered in one day, and 30 percent 
between 3 and 8 days, a dramatic improvement from the 60 to 90 days required in 2005.  In addition, 
improvements have been made to the judicial and legal framework.  The court system is better 
organized and new laws, including one on Administrative Procedure, are reducing the back-log of 
cases and strengthening the enforcement of court judgments.  Similarly, a new Bankruptcy Law has 
helped shorten the average court processing time from 43 to 26 months. 
20. 
Better infrastructure is strengthening competitiveness.  The Government has made a 
particular commitment to the transport sector, with significant Bank support.  Over the past 15 years, 
more than 200km of motorway roads have been rehabilitated and the average border entry and exit 

4 Invest Macedonia http://www.investinmacedonia.com: Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies.

time has decreased threefold.  Similar progress has been achieved in railways.  A new EU-compliant 
Railway Law, for example, has helped strengthen the entire sector.  Macedonian Railways (MR) has 
been reformed to improve the financial viability, productivity, and effectiveness of railway 
operations.  In addition, the energy sector is more efficient.  MEPSO (the public electric power 
transmission company) has increased the capacity of the transmission network by completing the 
power transmission line to Greece, and restored 38 transformer stations throughout the country, 
including the main power transformation station for the capital of Skopje.  This work has led to a 
significant reduction of technical losses and an increase in the stability of the power system.  

21. 
Closer alignment with EU Procurement Standards is enhancing transparency and 
predictability. Consistent with EU requirements, Parliament has approved a new public procurement 
law, and the Government has established an independent appeals commission and independent public 
procurement bureau (PPB) under the Ministry of Finance.  Authorities issued a detailed handbook 
explaining the law, and further developed an e-procurement system, which is now under pilot 
implementation.  These improvements to the procurement system are helping to level the playing 
field for all domestic and foreign investors.  Finally, the Government has asked the Bank for an 
assessment of its new public procurement system for the potential use of country systems for Bank 
financed operations. The Bank has responded to this request and cooperated very closely with the 
PPB, the EU and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) field offices in 
conducting the assessment at the country level. An action plan is in discussion with the PPB for 
further streamlining the implementation of the public procurement system with international good 
practices. 

D. Social and Human Development 

22. 
Non-income dimensions of poverty as measured by human development indicators have 
improved in several areas but remain low by EU standards.  Life expectancy at birth is about 74 
years, while the EU average is 78.  Infant mortality rates have dropped significantly to 13 deaths per 
1,000 live births. But this is still well above the EU average of five.5 The pattern is similar for 
education outcomes with gains over the last decade in primary and secondary enrollments, but lags in 
educational attainments and other outcomes. There have also been important advances in gender 
equality and empowerment of women over the past decade, with more women represented in 
Parliament, employed in the non-agricultural sector and, perhaps most importantly, enrolled in every 
level of education, with especially significant gains in tertiary education.  

23. 
FYR Macedonia is building an innovative and well-targeted social safety net.  The 
Government has improved its definition and calculation of benefits—including indexing benefits to 
inflation rather than wages—and revised the terms of eligibility.  It has taken advantage of a 
relatively well-targeted means tested last-resort program—Social Financial Assistance—to introduce 
a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, supported by the Bank.  The CCT will help to reduce the 
inter-generational transmission of poverty by linking benefits to the fulfillment of standards for 
secondary school enrollment and attendance.  Authorities are considering extending CCT benefits to 
improve outcomes in kindergarten and primary-school, job training and adult education, and the 
health sector, particularly through programs designed for mothers and children.

24. 
Improvements are also underway in pensions.  The Government has introduced parametric 
reforms to the existing defined benefit (PAYGO) system, including an increase in the retirement age 
and contribution rates and a reduced replacement rate.  Further, a voluntary defined contribution 
component was added in 2009 to complement the mandatory defined contribution system.  
Improvements were also made to consolidate collection of all social contributions, strengthen the 
regulatory and supervisory capacity for the payout phase in the fully funded pension scheme, and 
work with market participants on a range of investable instruments available for the pension funds.  
These are important measures, but the fiscal strains of the global crisis and the slow recovery are 
placing these achievements at risk. 

25. 
Particular attention has been directed to improving education outcomes.  Poor 
performance on the International Large Scale Assessment Studies (TIMSS, PIRLS and PISA) in 
2000 and 2001 has triggered wide reforms in education system.  Key challenges included improving 
teacher performance and strengthening enrollment.  Between 2004 and 2008, secondary enrollment 
increased from 85 to 95 percent, and dropout rates for primary school decreased to below 2 percent.  
A market for teacher training was established, along with criteria for accreditation and monitoring of 
teacher training.  The State Matura examination, the national assessment of student achievement, was 
given for the first time in 2008 in all four-year general and vocational schools.  From 2004 to 2007, 
49 percent of school managers and teachers reported improvements in students’ achievements; more 
than 60 percent saw improvement in planning and assessment processes, and 28.5 percent confirmed 
improved attendance and participation.  The Ministry of Education is administering a second round 
of School Improvement Grants, with support from the Bank, focusing on elementary and rural 
schools, as well as introducing electronic “school profiles” for all elementary and secondary schools, 
to house administrative records. 

26. 
Progress is also underway toward ensuring the sustainability of the health system.  The 
Health Insurance law was amended to streamline the operations, decision-making and transparency 
of the Health Insurance Fund (HIF), the public entity charged with coordinating health financing.  
These reforms permit a more efficient payment system for hospitals and other health care providers. 
The managerial capacity of the HIF has also improved, both through training and improved 
information systems.  In addition, efficiencies were realized through the competitive procurement of 
pharmaceuticals and changes in the payment mechanism to providers.  Most recently, the HIF board 
instituted reference pricing and stronger controls over spending. Financial results improved 
markedly.  Arrears of the HIF to suppliers were cleared in 2007, while financial obligations of the 
entire public health sector fell from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2004 to 0.4 percent in 2008.   

II. DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

A. Faster Growth 

27. 
FYR Macedonia’s development achievements have been substantial, but continued 
effort across a range of areas will be required to generate economic growth that puts people to 
work and improves living standards for all.  The Government and the World Bank Group agree 
that such growth will have to be faster, more inclusive and, increasingly, “greener.” 

28. 
Continued growth and employment creation will depend on sustained macroeconomic 
stability.  A continued prudent policy framework would narrow the fiscal and external imbalances 

9 

 
 
 
 
over the medium-term to ensure debt sustainability and manage the risks of new shocks and crises.  
At the same time, the structural problems of the FYR Macedonian labor market need to be addressed 
to ensure that high economic growth rates also translate into employment generation.  In the short-
run, this will require sustaining employment growth, including in the low-wage sector.  Over the 
medium term, it will require upgrading skills and enhancing productivity to boost employment 
outcomes. Finally, business environment reforms will support growth but also help “formalize” the 
economy and contribute to better and more secure jobs.  According to official estimates, the informal 
economy accounts for around 20 percent to GDP, though unofficial estimates put it as high as 30-40 
percent of value added in the economy.  

Create Jobs 

29. 
The sluggish pace of employment growth despite a relatively strong pre-crisis economic 
expansion raises concerns.  The official 2009 unemployment rate as measured through the Labor 
Force Survey was 32.4 percent, down from 33.8 percent in 2008 and a peak of 37.3 percent in 2005.  
This compares with 17.4 percent in Serbia; 29 percent in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and 12.5 percent 
in Albania (2008).  Alternative estimates based on the Household Budget Survey and using stronger 
filters to determine employment search efforts indicate the unemployment rate is somewhat lower, in 
the—still high—mid-20 percent range.  Signs of improvement are evident.  Since 2005, employment 
has grown by an average of 3.8 percent per year as the employment rate increased from below 38 
percent to 43.3 percent; but this growth has not resulted in a stronger reduction in the unemployment 
rate as it was accompanied by a steady increase in labor force participation, including during the 
crisis.  Moreover, most jobs created were low-paid. 

30. 
Reducing stubbornly high unemployment—and creating employment—will require a 
thorough analysis of structural problems. The Bank has worked closely with the Government 
toward understanding the labor market challenges, and analytical engagement has contributed to 
improvements such as a new Labor code, payroll reform, etc.  Addressing the remaining complex 
and dynamic labor market issues may require more in depth analysis of structural problems.  
Economic growth is certainly an important prerequisite for further job creation, but other factors can 
help to create more and better jobs.  On the labor supply side, further analysis will investigate 
whether lack of skills (especially “soft skills”), high reservation wages due to remittances and/or high 
public sector wages, and discouragement are among important factors contributing to poor labor 
market outcomes.  Enhancing skills would not only increase productivity and the quality of 
employment outcomes, but might also help reduce unemployment in cases of skills mismatch.  The 
overall social safety net probably does not discourage participation since benefits are not overly 
generous.  Still, it cannot be ruled out that some specific programs, such as the parental allowance 
and some unemployment benefits, awarded largely in the past, provided disincentives for 
participation.  Moreover, some programs can be redesigned to “award” activation.  On the legal and 
institutional side, the labor code has been reformed and institutional strengthening is ongoing – 
however, considerable efforts are still needed. 

Further Improve the Business Environment  

31. 
FYR Macedonia has improved its business climate but more can be done to build on 
recent improvements.  Areas where further efforts can pay off include streamlining administrative 
procedures, improving contract enforcement, and facilitating foreign trade, particularly by reducing 
tariffs and simplifying procedures and costs.  Advances are needed in safeguarding property rights 

10 

 
 
 
and the rule of law, facilitating competition through improved market entry and exit, and improving 
access to financing.  The remaining gaps in the financial sector framework need to be addressed to 
safeguard its stability and enhance its role in supporting growth.  Continuation of reforms of social 
security contributions will help wage competitiveness, but further reductions in labor taxation should 
not endanger the sustainability of public finances.  Though the burden of excessive regulations has 
been reduced it still impedes economic activity in certain areas.  The establishment of an Investor 
Aftercare Function can provide a venue for institutional dialogue with businesses and identification 
of excessive regulation.  Similarly, the mandatory Regulatory Impact Assessment needs to be 
strengthened to avoid build-up of excessive regulations.  Licensing and permit issuance, including 
construction permits, remain critical concerns voiced frequently by business representatives. Box 2 
describes the progress made in enhancing corporate financial reporting. 

Box 2: Regional REPARIS: Supporting Competitiveness and EU Integration 

The authorities have committed to enhance corporate financial reporting and accelerate adoption 
and enforcement of the Acquis Communautaire.   FYR Macedonia joined “The Road to Europe - 
Program of Accounting Reform and Institutional Strengthening” (REPARIS) - a regional initiative aimed 
at creating a transparent policy environment and effective institutional framework for corporate reporting 
within South Central and South East Europe.  REPARIS was developed by the Bank in close cooperation 
with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), EC and other partners, and 
offers training to senior civil servants, financial sector regulators and accounting and auditing bodies in 
emerging issues and new trends in both EU and global requirements impacting the regulation of 
accounting and auditing.  Other participants include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, 
Moldova, Montenegro, and Serbia. 

FYR Macedonia has made strides toward strengthening performance, including establishing a 
professional accountancy body (Institute of Certified Auditors) and audit oversight function, developing 
programs for educational and professional development, and proposing existing laws to be aligned with 
EU requirements.  However, as indicated in the EU Progress Report for 2009, much work remains.* 
“Alignment of the legal framework for accounting and auditing is lagging behind. The administrative 
capacity of the Institute for Chartered Auditors is still not satisfactory and no public oversight system 
aligned with the acquis has been established yet.” Further, changes in legislation to align accounting and 
auditing practices with the EU have yet to be adopted by the Parliament; and the Government needs to 
bolster efforts to strengthen education of accounting professionals and to establish a professional code of 
ethics. 

* http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2009/mk_rapport_2009_en.pdf  

Build Skills 

32. 
Ensuring FYR Macedonia’s competitiveness will ultimately depend on educating its 
population and achieving the national goal of becoming a “country of knowledge.” The 
Government’s strategy for education builds on ongoing reforms, such as the introduction of nine-year 
primary education, compulsory secondary education, and revised curriculums which promote 
outcome oriented and interactive teaching and learning, early learning of English language and 
information technology skills. In addition, budget increases for education are sought to reach the 

Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expenditure target of 5 percent of 

11 

 
 
GDP. There are significant ambitions for tertiary education, including introducing a credit-transfer 
system in compliance with the Bologna Declaration, which will open the doors for FYR Macedonian 
students to continue studies throughout Europe and attract foreign students to domestic universities, 
creating the basis for greater intellectual exchange.  This will help strengthen the capacity of 
domestic institutions to foster skills applicable to the EU market and increase the competitiveness of 
the labor force.  These investments are to be accompanied by new legislation supporting the legal 
framework for research in science and technology, with a view to facilitating connections with 
universities and industries and promoting international coordination in high-tech research. 

33. 
Improving education quality and access remain critical challenges. International 
standardized tests show that there has been little progress in certain measures of quality.  For 
example, FYR Macedonia participated in the PIRLS international test6, which measures performance 
in reading and comprehension of a variety of texts.  Between 2001 and 2006 (the last year with 
available data) the percentage of students reaching the minimum international benchmark of 
proficiency remained almost unchanged (decreased from 67 to 66 percent, while the best performing 
countries reach 95 to 98 percent).  Though secondary education is compulsory, expanding access to 
vulnerable groups remains an important challenge.  The gap in enrollment rates between the poorest 
and wealthiest quintiles is about 18-20 percentage points both at the secondary and tertiary levels.  
Roma children are underrepresented at all levels of education.  This is a common problem in the 
Western Balkans and one which the Government is taking action to overcome.   

34. 
Improving higher education is an important item on the development agenda.  Over the 
last decade, enrollment in higher education institutions in FYR Macedonia has increased rapidly7; 
though much of this increase has been in private universities, which have mushroomed in recent 
years, raising questions of quality.  At the same time, resources for public sector institutions have 
stagnated.8  Some public universities lack basic infrastructure and appropriately trained personnel to 
address the gaps between educational outcomes and labor market needs.  Higher education faces 
three main challenges.  First, the efficiency of the higher education system remains low with high 
drop-out and time-to-graduation rates; while reforms to address these problems have been started, 
they have not received sufficient financial support.  Second, quality assurance mechanisms need to 
be put in place.  The 2008 higher education law envisions establishing two sectoral bodies to improve 
outcomes in quality. Third, further investments in the sector will be needed to ensure that FYR 
Macedonian higher education institutions are competitive in the regional and wider European 
context.  

B. More Inclusive Growth 

Reduce Poverty 

35. 
Poverty in FYR Macedonia is high and static.  To understand poverty in FYR Macedonia 
it is useful to look at three recent periods over the past decade: the years before growth accelerated 
(2002-2006); the period when the economy was catching up (2007-2008) and the post-crisis period.  

6 Progress in International Reading Literacy 
7 According to data provided by the Ministry of Education and Science in 2008, 85% of graduated secondary school 
students enrolled in Higher Education Institutions compared with 64% in 2007 and 42% in 2006; higher 
education enrollment (gross, percent of population aged 19-24 ) in 2005 was 21,2% and 39,6% in 2007  
8 This year, 1.36 % of GDP was allocated for higher education and 0.10 % for science.  

12 

 
 
 
 
                                                            
The Bank completed a comprehensive poverty analysis covering the first period—2002 to 2006. 
Though this analysis does not reflect the dynamics of the economic crisis of late 2008, it provides a 
first look into the troubling fact that economic growth has not translated into reduced poverty.  Not 
only did the population living below the poverty line remain at around 20 percent, but, depending on 
how it is measured, extreme poverty increased by about 2 percentage points to 7 percent.  Though 
discouraging, the analysis noted mitigating trends.  First, jobs were created in the economy, including 
in the formal sector, though these jobs were neither high skilled nor high paying.  Second, a similar 
“stickiness” in poverty was observed in neighboring Albania and Serbia, which experienced lengthy 
incubation periods for poverty reduction.  Third, the Government responded aggressively with 
innovative, well targeted social protection programs.  These three factors, together with continued 
robust economic growth, provided a basis to expect some improvement in the coming years. 

36. 
No matter how poverty is measured, progress in FYR Macedonia continued to be slow.  
Looking at data for the second period from 2007 and 2008, using different methodologies, reveals 
little change from the previous four years.  The World Bank uses an absolute standard, which looks 
at some measure of what households should be able to count on to meet their basic needs.  Using this 
measurement, poverty jumped from 19 percent in 2006 to 23.5 percent in 2008; this is notable as 
these two years saw robust economic expansion with annual growth averaging 5.3 percent.  The 
Government, which uses an EU methodology, looks at relative poverty, i.e., defined in relation to the 
overall distribution of income or consumption in a country (specifically, the poverty line is set at 70 
percent of the country’s median expenditures per adult equivalent).  Using this methodology, poverty 
in the two years after 2006 stayed constant at just under 30 percent. There are also regional 
dimensions to the challenge, with significant disparities between regions. The Bank’s Poverty 
Analysis revealed that poverty in the nation’s commercial and political capital, Skopje, fell by nearly 
half during the first half of the decade, while stagnating or increasing elsewhere. Overall, the poverty 
rate varied from around 10 percent in the Southwest region to more than 30 percent in the Northeast 
region.  

37. 
The crisis may have halted any latent reduction in poverty that could have been 
expected from the preceding period of economic growth.  Using a standard methodology used in 
ECA countries, the reduction in GDP experienced in 2008 and 2009 would have been expected to 
increase poverty in FYR Macedonia from 23.5 to 23.9 percent. However, the picture remains 
uncertain, particularly as countervailing factors expected to reduce poverty in previous years remain. 
FYR Macedonia was relatively less affected by the crisis than its neighbors and the labor market was 
resilient with unemployment remaining stable.  Moreover, the Government remains committed to 
further strengthening its innovative and well targeted social programs.  

Strengthen Social Protection  

38. 
The current social protection system faces two important challenges: (i) ensuring the 
financial sustainability of the pension system and (ii) improving the effectiveness of the social 
safety net.  The sustainability of the pension system is threatened by the simultaneous reduction of 
contribution rates as part of the payroll tax reform and pressures to increase pensions.  The coverage 
challenge relates to the high unemployment and the large informal sector that effectively excludes a 
substantial population from the pension system.  Changes in the indexation formula and ad-hoc 
increases could affect long term sustainability.  The Government is considering additional measures 
to restore the long term balance in pension expenditures and revenues, including a retirement age 

13 

 
 
 
 
increase, further changes in indexation of pension benefits, changes in the PAYGO pension formula, 
and adjustments of the mandatory pension system contribution rates. 

39. 
Continued reform of social safety nets would continue to yield benefits.  The system still 
contains too many programs, with overlapping objectives and beneficiaries.  In addition, coverage of 
social assistance can be strengthened further, as it reaches only 43 percent of individuals in the 
poorest quintile. Among other factors, potential beneficiaries are subject to extensive means testing 
which limit the coverage, such as lack of proper documentation.  This is especially true for Roma and 
internally displaced people (see the Box 3 on Roma population in FYR Macedonia.) The CCT 
program has been designed to address these and other shortcomings, particularly by consolidating 
programs and unifying information systems. 

Box 3.  Reaching the Roma Population in FYR Macedonia 

The Roma population is significant in FYR Macedonia, though like elsewhere in the region is 
difficult to identify with certainty.  According to the last census from 2002, there were 53,879 persons 
counted as Roma in the country, or 2.7 percent of the population.  Some UN studies claim that there 
are around 260,000 Roma in FYR Macedonia or approximately 12 percent of the total population.*  
FYR Macedonia is a leading participant in the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015, a multi-country 
initiative supported by the Bank and other partners. The Government has contributed proactively to 
the initiative and has formed an inter-sectoral Country Working Group under the auspices of the 
Minister of Labor and Social Affairs and with active involvement of Roma NGOs.  The Country 
Working Group has developed a Decade Action Plan, which outlines the actions to be taken in the 
priority areas of education, health, housing and employment.  
The Bank is supporting Government efforts to include Roma communities in Government 
policy. The Conditional Cash Transfer project is designed to support obligatory secondary education 
and increase enrollment of Roma children into secondary schools, which currently stands at only 16 
percent.  FYR Macedonia has also been one of the main beneficiaries of the World Bank co-financed 
Roma Education Fund, utilizing more than US$3 million for 14 projects related to school-based 
mentoring support, advocacy activities for more integrated education of Roma students, and overall 
increase of enrollment rates of Roma children into primary and secondary schools.

Improve Health Service Delivery 

40. 
The health sector faces critical challenges in outcomes, sustainability and efficiency.  As 
noted above, life expectancy, infant mortality and other health indicators, while improving, 
significantly trail EU averages.  Lasting progress will depend on many factors, including more 
effective and efficient health services.  First, most people seeking care use emergency services (55 
percent) followed by hospitals (19 percent)—greater emphasis can be placed on promoting primary 
care and family doctors; second, there appears to be too many hospitals per patient, and productivity 
is low.  FYR Macedonia’s in-patient admission rate is half the average for the EU15 and lower than 
all countries in the region but Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Similarly, the hospital occupancy rate was 
only 54 percent, compared with averages of 78 percent in the EU15 and 74 percent in the newly 
member states.9

C. Greener Growth 

41. 
In 2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis, OECD members issued a declaration 
committing not only to sustain environmentally sustainable growth policies but stated that “green and 
growth go hand in hand.”10 It further added: Economic recovery and environmentally and socially 
sustainable economic growth are key challenges that all countries are facing today.  A number of 
well targeted policy instruments can be used to encourage green investment in order to 
simultaneously contribute to economic recovery in the short-term, and help to build the 
environmentally friendly infrastructure required for a green economy in the long-term, noting that 
public investment should be consistent with a long-term framework for generating sustainable 
growth. Green growth will be relevant going beyond the current crisis, addressing urgent challenges 
including the fight against climate change and environmental degradation, enhancement of energy 
security, and the creation of new engines for economic growth.  The FYR Macedonian authorities 
have committed to fundamental elements of this green growth agenda and are moving forward with 
environmental, energy and natural resource policies that will be necessary for EU accession. 

Prepare for Climate Change Challenges and Vulnerabilities 

42. 
Climate change is already affecting FYR Macedonia.  Of all 28 ECA countries studied as 
part of the World Bank Study, “Adapting to Climate Change in Eastern and Central Europe”, only 
three have experienced more climate related natural disasters since 1990. Only four countries are 
likely to experience more dramatic increases in climate extremes, and FYR Macedonia is near the 
bottom in capacity to adapt to these changes.  It is projected that by 2050, FYR Macedonia will be 
exposed to an average 1.9 C degree increase in mean annual temperature; a 5 percent mean annual 
drop in precipitation; a riskier agricultural environment; and exposure to new pests and crop diseases.  

43. 
The development implications of these trends are profound.  The expected drop in 
precipitation will have serious impacts on agriculture and planed investments in hydro power.  Other 
infrastructure assets, such as roads and railways may require engineering improvements to better 
withstand heavier rainfall.   Trends may exacerbate health risks as warmer temperatures and other 
factors increase the occurrence of certain diseases.   

44. 
Climate change will affect agriculture and forestry.  Rain-fed crop yields could decline 
substantially over the next 40 years (between 10% and 80% on average) with corresponding 
economic losses.11 Opportunities could occur from climate change, such as possibilities to extend the 
growing season with the doubling of crop cycles and enabling warm weather crops; however, 
preparation and investments would be required to realize such benefits.  Given this increasing 
uncertainty, as well as the environmental and economic importance of agriculture—which accounts 
for 18 percent of employment and 12 percent of GDP—developing a long-term adaptation strategy is 
critical to address two basic questions: first, which agricultural systems, including crop and livestock 
varieties, production technologies, irrigation systems, and farmer skills, will be most resilient in a 
changing climate? And second, which products will be most competitive in the EU market?

Box 4. Green Growth in Cities 

In FYR Macedonia, as around the world, cities are at the frontline of sustainable development.  
Increasingly, they recognize that they are not only part of the problem of climate change, but central to 
the solution. Home to two-thirds of the country’s population and accounting for most of its GDP, 
employment, productive services and knowledge-based sectors, cities are the driving forces of the 
economy and social development.  Worldwide, cities consume between 60-80 percent of total energy 
production and contribute to 70% of the world’s GHG emission.  An emphasis on sustainability can 
mean thinking beyond cities in the conventional sense of “engines of economic growth,” to cities as 
incubators for 
technological 
innovation, cultural enrichment, social 
integration and global 
connectivity—serving a range of national goals leading to faster, more inclusive, and greener growth. 
energy demand, minimize pressures on natural resources, and reap the co‐benefits of climate change. 
Cities are highly vulnerable to the adverse impact of climate change because they have the highest 
concentration of human and physical assets, and are often located near water bodies and along river 
banks.  At the same time, owing to economies of scale, cities offer major opportunities to reduce 
FYR Macedonian cities continue to face major environmental challenges including aging and 
inefficient infrastructure and housing stocks; and residual pollution and defunct factory buildings 
within urban populated areas which require redevelopment or recovery for more growth-oriented land 
uses.   As FYR Macedonia has implemented its decentralization program, municipalities in partnership 
with local stakeholders are taking greater responsibility in delivering sustainable solutions.  Therefore, 
strengthening municipal capacity in this context is a key element of both mitigation and adaptation to 
climate change. 

Improve Management of Water Sector 

45. 
Pressures on water supply and water sector administration are growing.  The country’s 
water resources are now, on average, adequate, but precipitation is uneven throughout the country 
and during the year.  About 75 percent of the country is classified as semi-arid.  Due to the seasonal 
fluctuation, FYR Macedonia depends heavily on its 22 large dams and more than 100 small dams for 
urban and industrial water supply and irrigation.  The water security of the southeast is a particular 
concern, with parts already classified as arid.  Desertification is likely to expand; by 2030, the 
average river run-off is projected to fall by 25 percent.  In the southeast, farmers are already 
experiencing water shortages for irrigation leading to substantial economic losses.  Industry and 
mining face similar challenges.  More integrated water sector planning is needed to inform decision 
making to ensure a sustainable growth path.  For example, the water and irrigation sectors have been 
consolidated and restructured, and a number of so called “water economies” have been established.  
However, governance and resources for maintenance and dam safety continue to be a concern. 

46. 
The municipal water utilities need reform to promote demand management.  A Public 
Private Investment Advisory Facility (PPIAF) funded strategy for reform of the water, sanitation and 
the solid waste sectors was prepared at the request of the Ministry of Finance.  The study 
recommended a phased program of reforms to address over-consumption, high water losses, 
operational inefficiencies, inadequate pricing policies, and poorly targeted user subsidies.  Financial 
stability is precarious, reflecting the mismatch between weak revenues and a high backlog of 
maintenance and rehabilitation.  The administration of the municipal water sector is fragmented. 
Local utilities are responsible for providing services but receive inadequate guidance and financial 
support from both municipalities and the central government. 

16 

 
 
 
 
Address Energy Sector Challenges 
47. 
The Government is concerned about the growing reliance on imported fossil fuels and 
energy inefficiency.  Fossil fuels account for more than 80 percent of energy consumption in FYR 
Macedonia, and an increasing amount of this is imported, including all liquid fuel and natural gas.  
Absent investment in new energy sources this trend will continue as demand grows while domestic 
production erodes.  The Government is committed to reversing this trend and strengthening energy 
security.  Greater energy efficiency is the first step in this direction—FYR Macedonia consumes very 
little energy per capita but a high amount per unit of GDP.  An immediate area of opportunity is to 
improve the efficiency of residential, commercial and public buildings, which account for up to 50 
percent of energy consumption.  The authorities also want to exploit renewable energy sources, 
starting with hydro-power, but also wind, solar and biomass.  Other aims include increasing the use 
of natural gas and reducing the use of electricity in heating buildings.

48. 
Reforming the regulatory framework and appropriately pricing energy supplies are 
critical to achieving energy efficiency.  The Government has been striving to improve electricity 
regulation but it is still unable to balance consumer and investor interests.  Regulation needs to 
incorporate a more objective methodology to estimate operating costs of power utilities, provide 
allowances for losses and bad debts, and adjust tariffs to enable recovery of the costs of doing 
business.  As at the last quarter of 2009, non-residential electricity tariffs in FYR Macedonia were up 
by about 25 percent compared to 2007, and by about 36 percent compared to 2006.  At US cents 
11.86/kWh, non-residential tariffs in FYR Macedonia are higher than most other countries in South-
East Europe except Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.  However, the residential tariff for 
electricity is very low due to a substantial cross-subsidy from non-residential to residential 
consumers, which constitutes a major barrier to shifting to gas for heating.  Though residential 
electricity tariffs have increased slightly, they lag well behind those in EU and other transitional 
countries.  Some important steps have been taken in recent years.  In 2008, prices for large 
commercial consumers were liberalized; residential consumers are set to follow in 2015 in terms of 
the Energy Community Treaty to which FYR Macedonia is a signatory.  The EC Treaty require re-
balancing tariffs through the gradual elimination of cross-subsidies; it requires each class of 
consumer to pay a cost-covering tariff, while allowing the government to provide a direct subsidy to 
the socially vulnerable consumers.  However, the financing of energy infrastructure will remain an 
issue, and more will need to be done to attract private capital.

III. COUNTRY PRIORITIES AND STRATEGY FRAMEWORK 

49. 
FYR Macedonia has established a generally clear and consistent policy direction.  
During the nearly twenty years since independence, successive governments have, by and large, 
maintained a prudent, pro-growth macroeconomic framework, and introduced ambitious structural 
reforms while making determined and innovative investments in social protection.  

The current Government campaigned on and is now carrying out a development program 

50. 
for 2008 to 2012—Rebirth in 100 Steps—which set out clear overarching objectives; specifically, 
the Government has committed to: 
 
increase economic growth and competitiveness to generate higher rates of employment and 
improved living standards;  
 
integrate FYR Macedonia into the EU;  
 
strengthen public administration and transparency and the rule of law;  
 maintain good inter-ethnic relations and coexistence upon the principles of mutual tolerance 
and respect; and 
invest in education as the most successful way of creating strong individuals.12 

 

51. 
Though advocating reforms in diverse sectors, the Government program highlights 
growth and employment challenges and states that “a strong economy is the basis for 
everything.”  The Plan supports achieving faster, sustainable growth as the means to create jobs and 
improve living standards.  Specifically, “One Hundred Steps” identifies macroeconomic stability, 
sustainable debt levels, and low taxes as the foundation for growth.  But it also recognizes 
complementary conditions, such as a favorable business environment, a more efficient agriculture 
sector, improved infrastructure, and better education and health systems.   The Program strives for 
“honesty” in governance, and identifies reforms to strengthen government reporting, judicial 
services, and anti-corruption activities as central.  Across all sectors, the Plan prioritizes upgrading 
public and private sector practices and systems to comply with EU Accession requirements 
delineated in the EU acquis.  The strategy has received strong public support. 

52. 
In addition to the broad national goals identified above, FYR Macedonia has clearly 
identified its path to EU membership.  It has done this through supporting policy documents 
including a National Development Plan, which serves as the basis for accessing EU funds,13 and a 
National Program for Adoption of the acquis communautaire (NPAA).  The NDP builds on and 
details the Government program, with a focus on meeting EU requirements in key areas; the NPAA 
is a detailed plan with a set timeframe for the passage of national legislation and other accession 
obligations.  As such, both documents provide a framework to tailor WBG support. 

12 Rebirth in 100 Steps. Program of VMRO-DPMNE 2008-2010 (www.VMRO-DPMNE.org.mk) 
13  The NDP is designed to (i) initiate investment programming that is consistent with the EU multi-annual 
programming practice and (ii) improve consistency of sectoral programming in public investments.  It assesses the 
existing economic, social and environmental situation; and identifies the key development/investment priorities at 
the national level.  Finally, the NDP sets medium-term planning of the all investments that are expected to be at least 
partially financed from domestic or foreign public fund sources.

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY 

A. Experience and Lessons Learned 

53. World Bank Group support over the FY07-FY10 CPS was highly relevant under both 
CPS pillars: (i) fostering job-creating economic growth and (ii) improving governance and 
transparency.  Both of these areas have remained central to FYR Macedonia’s development agenda, 
and Bank Group activities were designed to provide direct support through targeted interventions. 

54. 
The FY07-10 CPS Completion Report (CPSCR) assessed results in four "outcome 
clusters" linked to the CPS pillars and EU accession.  The clusters, which were introduced in the 
CPS Progress Report to improve program synergies and monitoring, included: i) growth and 
competitiveness, ii) the business environment; iii) human development, and iv) infrastructure.   

 Growth and Competitiveness:  Bank knowledge and advisory products helped strengthen the 
authorities’ understanding of key fiscal and economic challenges.  Examples include a FY08 
Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFA) which provided an assessment of financial 
management and public procurement systems, and a FY08 Public Expenditure Review.  A 
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) followed in FY09 with a detailed analysis of the 
restraints to sustained growth in FYR Macedonia and strategies for boosting investment in 

both physical and human capital.  The Bank also financed the development of the Industrial 
Policy Strategy (the first of its kind since independence in 1991). The aim of the Strategy is to 
align industrial policy with the EU’s Lisbon growth and jobs strategy, increase the 
competitiveness of the national economy and build a knowledge-based society. In addition, an 
investment operation upgraded agricultural standards and institutions to comply with EU 
Accession requirements. In response to the global economic crisis, the Bank provided just-in-
time non-lending assistance through the FY09 Policy Note on Crisis Response. 
 Business Climate: The Bank and IFC helped to reduce and streamline business registration and 
other commercial procedures, particularly through the "Regulatory Guillotine,” while increasing 
the efficiency and transparency of the judiciary, including case management and commercial 
dispute resolution. The Bank also helped improve the flexibility of its labor market through 
targeted Policy Notes and strengthen land administration through focused studies on Access to 
Land for Investments and Security of Land Tenure, the Land Market Study, the Illegal Objects 
Study, a Pilot exercise on inventory of state land in urban Strumica, all of which provided the 
basis for the successful Real Estate Cadastre project.  
 Human Development: Bank assistance helped strengthen access to and the quality of primary 
and secondary education, and boosted central and local planning under an ongoing 
decentralization effort. Investments strengthened the sustainability and financial management of 
healthcare, and improved the pension system and administration of benefits.  The (FY09) 
Programmatic Poverty Assessment and (FY10) Western Balkans Regional Study on Safety Nets 
have helped understand the contours of poverty in the country and the region more broadly and 
increase government capacity in collecting and using survey data. Within its education sector 
program, the Bank financed the development of the Overview of Sectoral Issues and Needs for 
Future Interventions in FYR Macedonia’s Higher Education and Research.  
Infrastructure: Investments helped to modernize the management and operations of the 
country's rail operations, and improve regional and local roads network, and the motorway to

Serbia. Non-lending assistance played a significant role in making the railway sector more 
efficient. The Bank financed the development of the Technical Note on the Status of the railway 
sector and Recommendations for improving the Operational and Financial Performance. An 
Adaptable Programatic Loan (APL) upgraded energy transmission infrastructure and promoted 
sound energy planning and regulation.  Less than satisfactory ratings in the human development 
and infrastructure clusters were attributable to mixed results on indicators and delays on the 
Global Environmental Facility (GEF) program supporting renewable energy and energy 
efficiency. A Water Sector Assessment is helping to strengthen the institutional capacity and 
identify the water supply needs and investment requirements to address growing water shortage 
in the south-east of the country. 

55. 
The World Bank supports a portfolio of 14 loans and four grants totaling US$337.4 
million in commitments.  The FY05 Cadastre and Registration Project is rated Highly Satisfactory.  
Three projects—the FY05 Business Environment Reform and Institutional Strengthening (BERIS) 
Project, the FY07 Sustainable Energy GEF, and the FY09 Conditional Cash Transfer—are rated 
Moderately Unsatisfactory or Unsatisfactory. One project—FY07 Legal/Judicial Implementation—is 
deemed at risk. The FY09 disbursement ratio was 13 percent, mainly because of disbursement delays 
from slow portfolio implementation during the country’s elections, and an initial delay in 
implementing the FY08 Regional and Local Roads Support project.  At end-FY10, the disbursement 
ratio was 17.4 percent.

Current financial management arrangements will continue to be used for project 
implementation as the performance to date has been generally satisfactory.  In parallel, 
possibilities of expanding the use of country systems to additional areas related to financial 
management will be assessed.  So far, country systems have been used in the area of flow of funds 
through the Treasury and the National Bank instead of using commercial banks.  In addition, in many 
projects civil servants are being appointed to work on project implementation.  In the coming CPS, 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the possibilities of using country systems in other areas such as external audit, internal controls and 
internal audit will be assessed.  In particular, the focus will be on better use of the Treasury 
accounting and reporting for project purposes instead of creating parallel duplicate systems for 
accounting and reporting within the implementation units. 

The CPS FY07-10 Completion Report     

57. 
Implementation of the FY07-FY10 CPS yielded several lessons: 
 Bank assistance in support of EU accession was largely successful and should continue in 
the next CPS.  Bank support was particularly valuable in aligning government policy with EU 
requirements. For example, the FY07 Agriculture Strengthening and Accession project 
strengthened the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy 
(MAFWE) to disburse and track funds for rural development in a way compliant with EU 
standards, including the EU funds allocated to farmers.  

 The focus on leveraging coordinated support from FYR Macedonia’s development partners 
has allowed for greater impact and greater selectivity. To increase the effectiveness of 
external support, the Government and its international partners agreed on a joint action plan to 
implement a Program Based Approach (PBA) concept in FYR Macedonia starting with five 
program areas: business environment/competitiveness, human development, agriculture, 
environment, and governance. The World Bank in close partnership with the EU delegation 
played a critical role in supporting the move toward a PBA and providing expert guidance.  
World Bank assistance positioned the country to better plan for and absorb EU pre-accession 
funds. The EU has decided to start linking the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) funds with 
sector approaches starting in 2011. 

 Stepped-up collaboration between the World Bank and IFC promoted synergies and 
improved development outcomes. For example, the Bank and IFC established in early 2009 a 
“One-Stop-Shop” support approach, which aims to integrate and coordinate Bank Group 
advisory services to improve the business environment and country competitiveness. Given the 
success of this and other programs, this CPS will continue to foster and strengthen Bank Group 
synergies, including by involving Bank staff in the concept phases of IFC advisory services, and 
supporting Bank-IFC consultations on key knowledge and analytical activities. 

 Efforts to jointly review and monitor CPS implementation have paid dividends and should 
continue over the next CPS.  The Bank and the Government established a successful 
collaborative mechanism for monitoring portfolio implementation—the CPS Implementation 
Stocktaking Tool.  Each quarter the Ministry of Finance and Bank staff identify short and 
medium term portfolio milestones, key bottlenecks, and proposed actions to be taken by the Bank 
and the Government to strengthen implementation.  The portfolio is then discussed at regular 
government sessions, and the conclusions are communicated to the Bank and Ministries in the 
form of a government decree.   

 Simplified project designs that accurately account for limited in-country capacity may 
improve portfolio performance. Some Bank operations had overly complex designs, 
particularly in defining expected results, and in some cases this complexity resulted in 
implementation delays.  The FY07 Sustainable Energy GEF project, which was restructured in 
June 2010, is an example. Realistic assessments of government capacity and implementation 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
22 

timeframes are important as the World Bank has opted to avoid free-standing Project 
Implementation Units (PIUs) in an effort to strengthen national institutions for project 
implementation. 

 Flexibility was crucial to the FY07-FY10 CPS, and will be fundamental going forward.  The 
Bank was able to quickly respond to the Government’s request to scale up a regional roads 
project from US$25 million to US$105 million, and by early 2009 was preparing a DPL to 
respond to the growing economic and financial crisis. 

 Continued consolidation of the portfolio will enhance results and provide resources for 
timely analytical engagement.  Consolidation will make better use of the Bank’s resources and 
Government managerial capacity, free up scarce internal resources for more analytical and 
advisory work with the Government on emerging challenges, and allow for the Bank to focus 
selectively on developing coordinated programs with other international partners.  

Partnerships and participation 

58. 
The Bank Group continues to be a significant development partner to FYR Macedonia, 
with disbursements of around US$50 million per year.  In addition, the Bank portfolio has 
attracted around US$40 million in grants or co-financing from different sources, and more than 
US$100 million in parallel financing. For example, the Education Modernization Project attracted 
US$2.5 million of trust fund co-financing for each dollar of Bank financing; and US$70 million 
parallel financing from EBRD almost matched the Bank’s US$105 million for Regional and Local 
Roads. FYR Macedonia has a solid track record in using trust funds for project preparation, utilizing 
around US$4 million for preparation of seven projects of the currently active portfolio.

The Bank will continue its focus on leveraging coordinated support through the PBA.  
The Government launched the PBA in five program areas: business environment/competitiveness, 
human development, agriculture, environment, and governance; the aim has been to better utilize 
international development assistance, including increasing country’s absorption capacity for EU pre-
accession funds.  Going forward, the Bank and IFC should continue to explore with the Government 
innovative ways of crowding-in public and private development financing for key areas, and deepen 
cooperation with the EC to ensure that the Bank Group’s global knowledge can continue to inform 
country’s development efforts. 

Consultations 

60. 
External consultations underpinned the preparation of the CPS. Meetings between the 
Bank and ministries during 2009-2010 launched the consultation process for the new CPS.  These 
consultations were continued in March 2010, when the ECA RVP and IFC staff met with selected 
ministers led by the Deputy PM and Minister of Finance to discuss the development priorities and the 
framework of the CPS.  Consultations with representatives of political parties took place in May and 
June, through meetings with representatives of the largest parliamentary groups.  These consultations 
were critical to ensuring that the program is focused on national priorities and has the support of 
stakeholders.  Despite the differences in party platforms, these consultations demonstrated overall 
consensus on the priorities related to economic growth, EU accession and sustainable development. 
During the same period, the Country Office embarked on focused consultations with other 
stakeholders. The consultation process started through a Client Survey (Box 5) and continued 
through focus group workshops organized in different regions of the country.  Participants in these 
workshops, made up of representatives of local governments, private sector and civil society 
organizations, agreed that the economic growth, improvement of infrastructure and business 
environment, as well as efforts to attract investments should be the main priority of the World Bank 
assistance. 

61. 
The Bank Group will continue to expand outreach and communication to strengthen 
partnerships in the implementation of the new CPS.  Communication tools include the Country 
Office web site, the Public Information Center (PIC) at the Central Bank, and the Global Distance 
Learning Network (GDLN) through the affiliation between the World Bank and the British Council. 
The Bank will also continue to support civil society activities through the Civil Society Fund, as well 
as through direct involvement in project preparation and monitoring. 

B. Areas of Engagement 

62. 
The objective of the FY11-14 CPS is to support faster, more inclusive and greener 
growth while helping to prepare for EU accession.  The CPS focuses Bank Group support in three 
areas of engagement: (i) faster growth - competitiveness; (ii) more inclusive growth – employability 
and social protection and (iii) greener growth - environmental sustainability and climate action.  In 
these three areas of engagement, the CPS is expected to contribute to specific development 
outcomes.  During the first half of the CPS, contributions toward these outcomes will come mainly 
from interventions carried forward from the FY07-FY10 CPS.  Outcomes in the outer years of the 
CPS are expected to come from new activities already identified under the new CPS.  Table 5 
provides a breakdown of ongoing and planned investment operations and knowledge and advisory 
activities for the FY11-14 CPS.

Box 5. Main Findings of Client Survey 

In May 2010, 500 stakeholders were invited to participate in a survey on the role of the Bank in FYR 
Macedonia.  Participants were drawn from national and local governments; bilateral or multilateral 
agencies; the private sector; NGOs; the media; trade unions; academia or research institutes; and the 
judiciary.  A total of 240 stakeholders participated in the country survey (48%), with more than half of 
the respondents employees from ministries.  Respondents were asked about the role and performance of 
the Bank as well as about general issues facing the country (see Annex 3 for more details). 

Familiarity: Respondents were generally familiar with the Bank, with 58 percent indicating they have 
been involved with or have been a close observer of the Bank for more than three years. 

FYR Macedonia’s General Environment: Respondents were less optimistic about the outlook for the 
country than in 2006.  This may reflect the global financial crisis and uncertainty in the ECA region. 

Development Priorities:  A strong majority indicated that economic growth was FYR Macedonia’s most 
important development priority—with 67 percent identifying it as the number one or two, EU accession 
followed at 49 percent.   Moreover, growth and jobs were identified as the number one priority for 
reducing poverty. As for what was necessary to stimulate growth, business climate, agriculture, energy 
infrastructure, and EU accession came out as top factors.  

The Bank Group’s Role: Most respondents thought the Bank considered economic growth (41%); 
poverty reduction (24%); and EU accession (15%)  as its top three priorities in FYR Macedonia—these 
were also the top three areas where respondents thought the Bank should be focusing. Fostering 
environmentally sustainable growth also appears high on both lists. 

Effectiveness: The Bank continues to be seen as fairly effective,  receiving a mean score of 6.4 out of 
10—similar to the 2006 rating; and more specifically, is seen as strong in “promoting effective 
development,” scoring 3.7 out of 5 (3.5 in 2006).  Respondents from Government institutions were most 
favorable while academics were least favorable.  The Bank was seen as most effective in helping to 
strengthen the financial system, promoting infrastructure and bringing about economic growth. Ratings 
were lower in reducing poverty, increasing employment, and in adapting to climate change. 

Lessons:  The 2010 Survey results are mixed. The overall ratings for effectiveness remain solid.  There 
are encouraging improvements in the way the Bank is perceived, with better ratings in accessing and 
dealing with Bank staff.   However, importantly, the results were less strong in areas that are seen as the 
highest priority, such as poverty reduction and promoting EU accession.  The focus in the next CPS on 
growth and employability, therefore, seems borne out by the Survey; but it also underscores the challenge 
of translating economic growth into better lives for FYR Macedonians.  Another lesson is that the Bank 
must continue to reduce bureaucracy and strengthen its knowledge services, technical expertise, and 
advisory services, and better tailor this work to the country’s particular challenges. 

Climate Change: The 2010 Client Survey introduced a focus on climate change, and the findings are 
notable.  While not a top priority, respondents felt fairly strongly that climate change is a serious problem 
and should be considered when thinking about growth policies in FYR Macedonia.  Moreover, a strong 
majority (68%) want the Bank to be “quite involved” in climate change efforts. There was also strong 
agreement on the need for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy; and again, respondents 
indicated that that they believe the Bank Group should play a role in securing these investments.

63. 
The CPS is structured to be particularly flexible over FY13-14 given the uncertainty on 
the pace of economic recovery and the rapidity of evolving development challenges.  Economic 
and fiscal conditions could shift significantly over the next few years, and the Bank may be requested 
to tailor its support to new circumstances.  Knowledge of climate-related threats is accumulating, and 
new data or findings may suggest new strategies or instruments.   

C. Principles of Engagement 

64. 
The selection of financial operations and knowledge and advisory services under this 
CPS, including programs to be identified in later years, has been or will be influenced by three 
key principles that reflect the findings of the CPSCR, government priorities, and the country 
environment: 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 World Bank Group assistance will be directed to support FYR Macedonia’s EU 
accession.  The CPS will help FYR Macedonia to develop and align policies with the EU 
acquis, and strengthen government capacity to implement related policies. 

 The CPS will leverage financing and expertise from within the World Bank Group and 
FYR Macedonia’s development partners.  As both public and private financing is expected 
to remain limited over the near term, the World Bank will capitalize on existing and new 
programs that engage multiple partners to maximize development impact.  For example, the 
Bank and IFC plan to expand their integrated “one-stop-shop” approach to business climate 
reforms to activities in energy efficiency and renewable energy.  The Bank plans to enhance 
its engagement with authorities to help the country better absorb and implement resources 
from other donors, while actively seeking partnerships on programs related to the CPS.  For 
instance, the Bank is already collaborating with Sweden and Norway on the Green Growth 
and Climate Change assessment and advisory support. 

 As noted above, the CPS is structured to be flexible in the outer years given uncertainty 
on the pace of economic recovery and the rapidly evolving development challenges. 

65. 
Complementing these principles, the CPS will continue to move toward greater 
selectivity and portfolio consolidation started under the current CPS. Selectivity entails deciding 
where the Bank Group can most effectively and strategically direct its scarce resources, which is 
largely determined by client demand and the Bank Group’s comparative advantages.  In addition, 
selectivity suggests greater scrutiny on the most appropriate mechanisms for Bank assistance, 
whether loans, grants, technical assistance, analytical support, or other means. As recommended in 
the CPSCR, the Bank is also striving to consolidate the portfolio into fewer, larger operations over 
FY11-14 to enhance the effectiveness of its assistance.  The aim is to continue the reduction in the 
portfolio begun in the current CPS to move from 14 operations at end FY10 to about seven by the 
end of the FY11-FY14 CPS period. 
66. 
In addition, the CPS program also reflects a deepening sub-regional focus in the 
Western Balkans and South East Europe.  FYR Macedonia is already benefiting from projects in 
the regional Trade and Transport Facilitation in South East Europe program and the Energy 
Community of South East Europe.  During this CPS period, the Bank expects to expand the 
Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CRIF) to include FYR Macedonia, with a particular emphasis 
on climate change.  In addition, FYR Macedonia will continue to engage in regional economic and 
sector work (ESW) as a means of utilizing available World Bank resources for knowledge generation 
more efficiently.  Key areas in this regard include poverty analysis, social policy, innovation and the 
financial sector.  Going forward, new priorities could be added, based on client demand and the 
amenability of the topic/sector to a regional rather than a country approach. 

D. Outcomes 

67. 
The CPS recognizes that the goals of faster, more inclusive and greener growth are 
interconnected.  For example, agriculture is central to accelerating growth, yet is also related to 
green growth and climate change.  The FY11 DPL addresses macroeconomic stability, financial 
strengthening as well as health and pension reform, and will therefore contribute to outcomes in 
faster growth and social inclusion.  As such, the mapping of CPS outcomes to the CPS’s three areas 
of engagement reflects the cross-cutting nature of the interventions.  Activities under this CPS will 
consider and capitalize on these linkages and relevant opportunities. 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
I: Faster Growth—Competitiveness  

68. 
The CPS will provide support to enhance macroeconomic stability and competitiveness.  
FYR Macedonia, like many countries in ECA, confronts an economic and financial environment far 
more challenging than existed prior to the 2008-2009 crisis.  As ECA was the worst hit of all 
developing and transition regions, FYR Macedonia’s primary trade and financial partners are 
expected to show tepid growth over the short-term.  In addition, capital will likely be scarce and 
imports sluggish.  In this context, the Bank Group has and will continue to engage closely with the 
authorities to identify where it can provide support to improve macroeconomic stability.  Identified 
interventions include the following. 

69. 
CPS Outcome – Continued Macroeconomic Stability.  The second operation of the DPL will 
help consolidate macroeconomic stability by supporting measures to maintain sustainable debt levels, 
furthering reforms to the pension system, and strengthening the health financing system.  It will also 
bolster the resilience of the financial sector by adopting a new law to consolidate the independence 
and accountability of the Central Bank, while at the same time improving coordination between the 
Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance and establishing a Supervisory Committee to increase the 
supervisory capacity of relevant bodies.  The associated trust fund supports implementation of the 
reforms to promote economic growth and job creation through improvement of the investment 
climate and the strengthening of governance and efficiency in the public sector.  

70. 
CPS Outcome – Land Reform: Establish an efficient land administration system. The 
FY05 Real Estate Cadastre project has been supporting development of an efficient and effective real 
estate cadastre and registration system, with a view to developing land and real estate markets.  
Additional financing for this project was approved in FY10, which will extend the project’s closing 
date until December 2013. Planned activities under this CPS include supporting the digitization and 
vectorization of cadastre maps, facilitating data sharing among public, private, and government 
institutions, upgrading the national geodetic reference infrastructure, and supporting the development 
of national spatial data infrastructure in line with the EU's INSPIRE Directive.  The project will also 
build capacity within the Authority of Legal and Property Affairs, which oversees property and legal 
issues involving public authorities and agencies.  

71. 
CPS Outcome – Judicial Reform: Increase the efficiency of the judicial system and 
improve courthouse infrastructure.  The FY06 Legal and Judicial Implementation project, which is 
expected to close in July 2011, will continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of judicial 
services. Remaining activities will aim to strengthen judicial institutions; support implementation of 
new bankruptcy legislation; develop a framework for administrative disputes by improving judicial 
management; and invest in court infrastructure, such as constructing and rehabilitating courthouses 
and enhancing judicial information technology systems.  IFC has also been contributing to the 
judicial reform and access to justice, through its Alternative Dispute Resolution Project, which 
promotes usage of mediation as alternative to court proceedings. 

72. 
CPS Outcome – Municipal Services: Improve local services and infrastructure in selected 
areas.  The Municipal Services Improvement Project, which became effective in mid-2009, will help 
selected municipalities to: (i) improve the financial performance of specific investments; and (ii) 
build the capacity of municipalities and their communal service enterprises, particularly by 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
undertaking financial reforms, enhancing communications with residents, and 
increasing  
transparency—as measured by participation in international performance benchmarking.  To date, the 
project has elicited interest from about a dozen municipalities, and most loan funds are expected to 
be committed during the next two years. 

73. 
CPS Outcome – Roads: Improve road infrastructure and resilience to climate change and 
strengthen management capacity. The FY08 Regional and Local Roads Program Support Project, 
which is due to close in 2013, will continue to build capacity of the Agency for State Roads and 
invest in rehabilitation of the regional and local road network, with a view to expanding access of 
isolated communities to markets.  The FY07 Second Trade and Transport Facilitation project, which 
closes in FY11, will continue efforts to lower transport and freight costs, particularly by improving 
border crossing facilities, upgrading a road corridor section to motorway standards, and harmonizing 
and improving telecommunications and cargo data exchange between railways and customs.  Under 
this project, freight processing times will be reduced and non-tariff trade obstacles removed between 
FYR Macedonia and its neighbors.  IFC will consider its support to structure PPP for modernizing 
and managing the toll road system of Corridor X and the concession of Corridor VIII highways. 

74. 
CSP Outcome – Education: Improve quality in higher education. World Bank Technical 
Assistance in FY11/12 will support the Ministry of Education and Science in making informed 
policy choices with regard to financing of higher education, including establishment of bodies for 
external quality assurance in accordance with good practice and European agreements and 
guidelines, and will support development of internal quality assurance. In preliminary discussions, 
the Government has expressed interest in exploring a possible follow-on education project in the 
outer years of the CPS. 

75. 
CPS Outcome – Increase financing and investment in competitive fields.  FYR Macedonia 
has potential for a diversified economy and for significant investments and exports, including, inter 
alia, automotive components; healthcare products and pharmaceuticals; agribusiness and food 
processing, and metals and metal products. Though FYR Macedonia has supported a specialized 
agency entitled Invest in Macedonia to attract FDI to these and other sectors, capital inflows remain 
below expectations.  In this context, IFC will continue to support programs over this CPS that 
improve the country’s business environment and promote financing and investments in competitive 
sectors. Through its regional Investment Climate program, IFC will help FYR Macedonia to improve 
its business environment in line with the overall EU accession agenda, including in tax 
administration and trade logistics.  IFC expects to provide equity and long-term financing and 
advisory assistance to commercial banks to support lending to SMEs, agribusiness enterprises, and 
trade finance, including through IFC’s Global Trade Finance Program. IFC will explore opportunities 
to finance competitive local companies in pharmaceuticals, construction materials, and healthcare.  In 
parallel, IFC will focus on supporting regional players and south-south investments, especially in 
sectors where FYR Macedonia has clear competitive advantages for exports.  Through its corporate 
governance and international standards programs and technical regulations with a focus on 
agribusiness, IFC will continue to assist private companies to improve their access to finance and 
increase their exports. 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
II: More Inclusive Growth—Employability and Social Protection 

76. 
The Bank will continue to support innovative and effective investments in social 
protection and human capital.  The failure of past growth to translate into lower poverty makes it 
important for the Bank to deepen its support to government efforts to reach the poorest and most 
vulnerable.  At the same time, the importance of human capital to FYR Macedonia’s long term 
competitiveness and job creation necessitates sustained assistance in education. 

77. 
CPS Outcome – Social Safety Net: Cash benefits reach the most vulnerable.  The FY09 
Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Project will contribute to social protection and human capital.  The 
program, the first of its kind in ECA, will condition cash benefits on secondary school enrollment, 
and will be expanded to primary and pre-primary, as well as health care and adult training programs.  
In addition, the CCT project aims to improve the administration of services under the social safety 
net, including oversight mechanisms, service delivery, and monitoring and evaluation.  Harmonizing 
overlapping programs is another means to improve the existing system, which has achieved broad 
coverage and effective targeting.  More broadly, the project aims to leverage increased efficiency to 
realize fiscal savings, which may create space for an increase in spending on social assistance, which, 
at 1 percent of GDP, is low compared to averages in ECA (1.7%) and the OECD (2.5%). 

78. 
CPS Outcome – Health: Improve Health Outcomes.  Despite improvements in health care 
delivery and financing resulting from multiple investments channeled through the World Bank 
financed policy and investment operations in the last ten years, there is scope for further Bank 
engagement in the health sector.  Health care is not, as such, included in the acquis communitaire; 
this suggests the value of continued Bank engagement in a sector in which it has built relationships 
and important country knowledge.    The DPL has already identified some of the policy areas in 
which the Bank can provide advice through non-lending Technical Assistance (TA).  In addition, the 
Government has expressed interest in a possible investment loan in the outer years of the CPS to 
address areas such as reducing financial vulnerability of the system and preventing the deterioration 
of health outcomes. 

79. 
CPS Outcome – Employability: Reduce impediments to hiring.  The proposed FY11 DPL 
will help strengthen the business climate by supporting a reduced labor tax wedge, more efficient 
public sector spending and financial sector reforms.  Key reforms include reducing Social Insurance 
Contributions to 27 percent of the gross wage, and measures to safeguard the long-term sustainability 
of the pension and health sectors.  In addition, the FY11 DPL will support government efforts to 
restrain growth in public sector wages and improve the process through which wages are set in the 
public sector.  DPL support will be linked to improvements in the social safety net, including 
improved targeting of benefits.   

III: Greener Growth—Environmental Sustainability and Climate Action 

80. 
The Bank will undertake a flagship program of analytic work to help FYR Macedonia 
better understand the macro-economic case for investing in green sectors and “greening” 
brown sectors as a stimulus for stronger growth.  This work will initially focus on key areas 
where the Bank supports ongoing or planned programs, such as in energy, water, transport, 
agriculture, urban development, land administration, education, and procurement.  Among other 
outcomes, this assistance will help promote adaptation to climate change and lower-carbon growth 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
options into policy and investment planning decisions.  Lending operations implemented through this 
pillar will serve as important learning platforms for how green growth objectives can be reached 
through investments—in ways more explicit than in previous operations.  

81. 
CPS Outcome–Energy: Improve energy sector efficiency and environmental sustainability.  
This is an area where the World Bank Group can achieve synergies in support of stronger and more 
sustainable CPS outcomes: 

 

 

 

IFC will contribute to a more efficient energy sector by supporting public-private 
participation in “greener” energy.  A particular focus will be on supporting the construction of 
new hydro power plants.  Though the Government has recently passed a new concessions law 
that is generally consistent with international best practice, many by-laws and regulations have 
yet to be adopted.  In addition, the Government has limited experience implementing PPP 
projects.  IFC can play an important role through both financing and advisory services.  It plans 
to provide advisory assistance and long-term financing to banks to support on-lending to small 
hydro-power plant projects.  For example, IFC is implementing a new regional Advisory Services 
program entitled "Renewable Energy in the Western Balkans with a focus on Small Hydro Power 
Plants," which supports investments in FYR Macedonia, Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
This project is expected to facilitate more than US$300 million in financing, including US$30 
million from IFC, to support the construction of 100 small hydropower plants with a total 
installed capacity of 200 MW and carbon mitigation potential of 1Mt CO2/year.  The project’s 
key objectives include: (i) improving the existing regulatory framework to enable sponsors to 
develop and construct small hydropower plants; (ii) strengthening their designs and business 
plans in collaboration with sponsors; and (iii) working with selected financial institutions in the 
Western Balkans to improve their capacities and knowledge on small hydropower plants and 
project financing, which may entail IFC providing financing to financial institutions to on-lend to 
small hydro projects.  

IFC will look for opportunities to engage with financial institutions in FYR Macedonia 
which want to provide lending to industrial sector clients for improving energy efficiency or 
setting up small renewable energy projects (small hydro, wind, biomass etc.).  IFC will 
channel financing and advisory assistance to support sustainable energy programs, particularly to 
replicate residential and small and medium enterprise (SME) energy efficiency programs from 
other countries, and promote financing for sustainable energy projects by local banks. These 
activities would be complemented with workshops and seminars targeting a wider public to 
promote energy efficiency and best renewable energy technologies.  Energy efficiency products 
might also be of interest for SMEs as it helps to them to reduce production costs using more 
energy efficient equipments and to improve their competitiveness. 

IBRD will also support the energy sector.  Additional financing for the Energy Community of 
South East Europe (ECSEE) APL 3 is proposed in FY11 to extend an electricity transmission 
interconnection from Stip in eastern FYR Macedonia to Nis in Serbia.  The Government has 
asked the Bank for support in FY12 for a hydroelectric power facility in Lukovo Pole in the 
north-west part of the country and may be interested in an energy efficiency project for schools 
and health facilities in FY13.  These projects will help meet and/or reduce energy demand, which 
is expected to grow by 2.6 percent annually over the next decade.  These goals are important as 
more than half of FYR Macedonian firms surveyed indicated that electricity supply is a problem.  
The ongoing GEF Sustainable Energy Project will support the Government in setting up a large-
scale national program to retrofit public buildings in order to increase energy efficiency of these 

30 

 
 
 
 
buildings.  It will provide capacity building support for this national program while at the same 
time finance energy efficiency measures in schools, kindergartens and hospitals. The ECSEE 
APL3 is supporting the “green agenda” by reducing power losses and increasing the stability of 
the power system, mainly by strengthening the transmission network.  The planned FY11/12 
Energy Efficiency TA will help the Government strengthen the institutional capacity of key 
agencies overseeing energy use, catalyze the market for energy efficiency services, and address 
tariff structures and other regulatory barriers to energy efficiency.  The Bank would assist FYR 
Macedonia in meeting its obligations under energy acquis and Energy Community Treaty. These 
activities will be coordinated with the EC-funded technical assistance to the regulatory agency 
and involve the World Bank Institute managed regional program for building institutional 
capacity in energy efficiency. 

82. 
CPS Outcome – Water and Solid Waste: Strengthen integrated water management capacity 
in line the EU Water Framework Directive.  Water management in FYR Macedonia faces many 
challenges, including aligning the sector with the EU environment acquis, which requires a more 
integrated approach to managing water resources while responding to the demands and interests of, 
inter alia, agriculture, energy, and natural resource protection.  The planned FY11/12 Water Sector 
Capacity Building TA funded by trust funds will help support government reform efforts and focus 
analysis on priority water-related topics.  Studies may address ways to more efficiently manage bulk 
water supplies; pilot a river basin in geographic area; or develop sector-wide priority investment 
programs.  To achieve programmatic synergies, the Municipal Services Improvement Project is on-
lending to municipalities to cover utility expenditures that rehabilitate water infrastructure, while 
encouraging institutional reforms through its performance grant component. IFC will consider its 
advisory support to larger municipalities in the country to address their environmental issues by 
providing support to concessionaires in solid waste management or in the future waste water projects.  

83. 
CPS Outcome – Agriculture: Align sector with EU requirements; strengthen sector 
competitiveness; adapt to climate change.  Agriculture plays an important role in FYR Macedonia’s 
economy and accounts for 18 percent of GDP and substantial employment in rural areas, where 21 
percent of the population lives in poverty. The FY07 Agriculture Strengthening and Accession 
Project will continue efforts to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture to 
distribute EU Rural Development funds, restructure the irrigation system, and develop veterinary 
capacity for an EU-compliant food safety system. In addition, the project is supporting the 
development and dissemination among farmers of a Code of Good Agricultural Practices integrating 
biodiversity and agriculture and promoting sustainable soil and water management.  An FY10 
agriculture and climate change TA program funded by Regional Trust Fund (TF) resources is raising 
awareness of the potential implications of climate change. It will also sponsor a agriculture and 
climate change impact assessment, and develop a country-specific menu of adaptation options in 
consultation with the Government and farmers. 

84. 
CPS Outcome – Policymaking for Green Growth and Climate Action:  Inform and support 
implementation of “win-win” solutions. Beyond specific investments, the Bank Group and the 
Government agree that much more needs to be understood about the possible developmental impacts 
of climate change and the opportunities for green growth. FYR Macedonia’s other development 
partners share this view. The Bank, with envisioned financial contributions from Sweden and 
Norway, will support the Government to develop policy recommendations related to climate change, 
sustainable development and green growth, focusing on identification of “win-win” investments in 
high priority areas. Support will be provided through policy notes in energy, water, agriculture, 
industry and transport that assess the economic costs and benefits of green growth and climate 

31 

 
 
 
change policy actions.  In addition, the World Bank will support the Government in implementing its 
policy decisions by seeking to include these recommendations in its own investment programs 
whenever possible. This analytical work will commence in 2010 and its results will inform future 
World Bank support.14 

85. 
The Bank will assist the Government in establishing new catastrophic risk insurance.  
The World Bank and the Government are working on the preparation of FYR Macedonian 
participation in the Southeastern Europe and Caucasus Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (SEEC 
CRIF).  The overall objective of the SEEC CRIF is to increase access to financial protection for the 
Government as well as homeowners, farmers and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from losses 
due to weather extremes caused by climate change and geo-hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, 
droughts, floods, hail, etc.  The CRIF is expected to provide particular support to the Government in 
terms of forecasting climate-related impacts.  The World Bank would provide an IBRD loan to 
finance FYR Macedonia’s participation in the Facility. 

E. The CPS Financing Program 

86. 
A significant share of IBRD financing over FY11-FY14 will come from ongoing 
operations approved during the previous CPS.  Total remaining disbursements are expected to 
amount to some US$205 million during the FY11-14 CPS period. 

87. 
The total volume of new IBRD commitments under the CPS over FY11 and FY12 is 
expected to amount to about US$104 million.  The Government has asked for a total envelope that 
would imply lending of similar amounts over FY13 and FY14.  Overall lending amounts will depend 
on the IBRD's lending capacity and demand by other borrowers as well as Government demand and 
performance in the course of the CPS period. The lending program for the last two years of the CPS 
will be discussed with the authorities closer to the time of the CPS mid-term Review.  The CPS plans 
to include policy-based lending, beginning with US$30 million for the second operation of the 
programmatic DPL in FY11.  The DPL operation will focus on public expenditure management and 
reforms to the social safety net.  Later DPLs would focus either on growth and competitiveness 
and/or a green growth agenda resulting from the analytical work set to begin in FY11.  

88. 
The amount of budget support during the CPS could be affected by FYR Macedonia’s 
growth and economic performance, particularly given a highly uncertain regional 
environment.  For example, if the country is hit hard by negative economic events in the eurozone, it 
may be interested in greater DPL support contingent on a sound macroeconomic framework.  Should 
there be a need for any significant changes to the currently proposed DPL lending as a result of these 
or other factors, alternative scenarios would be discussed with Bank Management and presented to 
the Board in the CPSPR. 

89. 
IFC expects to invest up to US$100 million in the private sector in FYR Macedonia over 
the next four years.  It also plans to leverage its advisory services to secure private financing for 

14 Sweden and Norway expressed interest in supporting the World Bank in implementing this CPS with 
approximately US$2 million to create a multi-donor trust fund to co-finance “green growth and climate change 
assessment and advisory services” with the World Bank.  The work related to “green growth and climate change 
assessment and advisory services” is designed to attract the support of other international partners.

F. The CPS Knowledge Program 

90. 
The 2010 Client Survey and the CPS consultation process revealed strong support for 
continued analytical engagement with the Bank Group.  Indeed, a higher percent of respondents 
indicated that the Bank’s knowledge was the “greatest value” to FYR Macedonia than those who 
answered “financial resources”; and when including “policy and economic advice” as a separate 
category the percentage over the financial resources category was more than double. As for which 
areas respondents believed the Bank’s knowledge services were most relevant, respondents answered 
“Labor Markets and Job Creation” (26%), followed by Agriculture (18%) and Education (16%).  The 
Bank Group envisages an active program of analytical engagement with FYR Macedonia, including 
in the top priority areas identified in the client survey. Selected areas of engagement include the 
following: In FY11 the Bank will provide Technical Assistance (TA) in energy efficiency and higher 
education and will complete a comprehensive water sector assessment. Further, in the second year of 
the CPS, FY12, the Bank intends to deliver a major analytical study which will look at green growth 
and climate change, with envisioned trust fund support from Sweden and Norway, a national 
procurement study, a labor market reform TA, as well as non-lending TA to support the 
Government’s innovation and science and technology agenda.  Plans for FY13 include non-lending 
TA dialogue in the health sector. 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
91. 
The Bank and IFC’s knowledge programs are also helping to advance FYR 
Macedonia’s regional integration in the Western Balkans.  IFC will continue implementation of 
its mainly regional program of advisory services.  These are aimed at helping FYR Macedonia meet 
acquis requirements to accelerate EU accession and strengthen the business environment and 
capacity of the local private sector to compete in a more integrated European market; the program 
also supports integration within the sub-region of the Western Balkans through the formal sharing of 
reform experiences and best practices. The Bank will also carry out more regional sector work, 
including two the ongoing programmatic series – Western Balkans Poverty Assessment, and Western 
Balkans Financial Sector TA. In addition, the Bank will carry out a Western Balkans Regional Study 
on Innovation and continue the Regional REPARIS program (Regional Road to Europe Program of 
Accounting and Reform and Institutional Strengthening) to strengthen corporate financial reporting. 

V. RISKS 

92. 

Implementation of the CPS is subject to the following risks:   

 FYR Macedonia’s growth outlook is subject to uncertainties on the timing, speed and 
shape of the recovery from the global crisis.  ECA has been the hardest hit of all regions, 
and its recovery is expected to be the most protracted. Lower than expected growth could 
also impact debt sustainability and may require further policy adjustment.  This is particularly 
true given the ongoing instability in Greece and in the eurozone more broadly.  The Bank 
will help analyze the risks through continued monitoring and dialogue with the authorities on 
the overall macroeconomic context, as well as through analysis of options for remedial 
measures and program adaptation, contingent on need and government request.  

 Failure to resolve negotiations with Greece on the “name issue” could continue to slow 
EU accession and dampen public support for reforms.  The Bank will continue to monitor 
developments closely, including any impact a delay in EU accession might have on political 
and macroeconomic stability as well as on the Bank’s program. 

 Continued high unemployment may directly affect the social balance in the country, 
provoke social tensions and undermine Government support to the reform program.  
The CPS is focused on employment generation, and supports interventions in social 
protection and skills development with the aim of translating economic growth and the recent 
increases in labor participation into more and better jobs for all FYR Macedonians.  

 FYR Macedonia is vulnerable to natural disasters, including, increasingly, severe 
climate pressures. The country has suffered devastating earthquakes in the past and seismic 
activity remains common.   Severe droughts are projected and aridity could affect agriculture. 
The Bank is engaged in analytical work in both the water and energy sectors and will be 
supporting the country through the regional Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility.

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA 
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY07–10 COMPLETION REPORT 

This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) reviews 
the experience 
implementing the FY07–10 World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Report No. 38840-MK, dated March 2, 2007). The document 
assesses the effectiveness of Bank Group’s strategy in (i) aligning its objectives with FYR 
Macedonia’s long term strategic goals; (ii) setting relevant, measurable and realistic CPS outcomes; 
and (iii) achieving its expected outcomes in an efficient and sustainable way. In addition to 
discussions with the country team and government counterparts, this assessment is based on 
reference documents such as the CPS, Project Appraisal Documents, Implementation Status Reports, 
supervision reports, and reports related to Economic and Sector Work. The findings of the 
assessment have informed the preparation of the FY11-FY14 CPS.  

INTRODUCTION 

Since FYR Macedonia joined the World Bank in 1994, Bank financing has helped the Government 
maintain macroeconomic stability, reform the enterprise sector and develop a sound financial sector, 
and provided investment support in key sectors including energy, roads, irrigation, community 
development, health, education, and others sectors.  Some 50 loans have been approved with a total 
value of around US$1 billion. Around half of all lending has been on concessional IDA terms.  But 
because of improved economic performance and creditworthiness, FYR Macedonia graduated fully 
from IDA in 2003.   

During the four years of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FYR 
Macedonia during FY07-FY10 (hereafter referred to as CPS07), the World Bank delivered 9 lending 
operations for a total of US$292 million (see Table 1). This was slightly more than the CPS lending 
envelope of US$280 million. The lending included 3 DPLs and 6 investment projects, with DPL 
proportion representing one third of overall new commitments.  

The World Bank maintained a high-case lending program, based on the strong reform efforts of the 
Government. This is particularly noteworthy among the countries of the Western Balkans, where 
volume has been declining as IDA constraints have begun to apply and where the full transition to 
IBRD has proven to be difficult for creditworthiness reasons.  In fact, FYR Macedonia’s strong

performance has allowed the Bank to continue lending on full IBRD terms at a stable level over the 
past decade.   

The CPS07 presented an IBRD program of support for the period FY07-10, which sought to build on 
the markedly improved macroeconomic management and structural reform progress since the 2006 
elections.   The IBRD program focused on fostering job-creating economic growth and increasing 
living standards for all, and improving governance and transparency in public sector delivery to 
support a market economy.

THE GOVERNMENT’S LONG TERM DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

The Government work program, articulated in its 2006 election program entitled “Rebirth in 
100 steps”, served as basis for the CPS. Returned to power in June 2008 with an increased majority 
after early parliamentary elections, the ruling coalition has a strong mandate to govern until 2012. Its 
new program “Rebirth in 100 steps: Upgraded and Expanded” aims at improving the living standards 
of all citizens, increasing employment, strengthening the fight against corruption, consolidating 
democracy and improving interethnic relations in accordance with the Ohrid Framework Agreement.  

European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) integration is the first 
priority of the government program, endorsed by the entire coalition.  Following a 1997 
cooperation agreement with the EU, the country signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement in 
April 2001, giving it access to European markets. In December 2005, it obtained candidate country

status for EU accession. Efforts to implement the “acquis communitaire” has since then driven 
governments reforms in accordance with the Accession Partnership Priorities, and include: judicial 
reform, police reform, public administration reform, anti-corruption policy, protection of human 
rights and of minorities, free movement of goods, labor policy, monetary policy, financial regulation, 
public procurement, agricultural and rural development, consumer and health protection, education 
and science. Based on the progress made, the European Commission’s 2009 Progress Report 
recommended the opening of accession negotiations. 

A second strategic goal of the government is to improve business climate. Structural reforms to 
improve the investment climate are central to the program, with a focus on: (i) reducing the burden of 
superfluous business regulations and requiring a regulatory impact assessment (for new regulations); 
(ii) reducing the business registration process time further from five to three days; (iii) completing 
the land cadastre and real estate registry; (iv) ensuring a more efficient and competitive financial 
system; (v) further increasing labor market flexibility; and (vi) protecting ownership rights, contract 
enforcement and shareholders rights. The government was also keen on advertising heavily in major 
western business publications and providing a package of incentives to potential investors. Improving 
the rankings of the country in the annual “Doing Business” report on the adequacy of business 
regulation has been a constant goal for the authorities.  

A third long term strategic goal is to increase competitiveness, actively promote a new 
industrial policy and improve the performance of the agriculture sector. The government has 
adopted in 2009 a strategic industrial policy plan15, the first of its kind since independence in 1991. 
The aim of the plan is to align industrial policy with EU’s Lisbon growth and jobs strategy, increase 
the competitiveness of the national economy and build a knowledge-based society. The policy 
focuses on five areas: promoting foreign direct investment (FDI); increasing resources for research, 
development and 
innovation, developing eco-friendly 
technologies, products and services; 
encouraging of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs); and establishing of clusters. The 
competitiveness strategy includes the development of high-tech industries, along with the 
modernization of the country’s main traditional export branches (metals, textiles and food 
processing). The agriculture is also high in the government priorities, with plans to develop land 
markets, promote FYR Macedonian agricultural products for the export markets, and increase 
farmer’s access to credit.  

 A fourth objective is to fight corruption, improve governance and modernize public service 
delivery. The government’s anti-corruption plan, which has been allocated specific budget, calls for 
special investigation measures in corruption cases, strengthening of operational coordination among 
law enforcement agencies and implementing provision on campaign financing. The government’s 
program also calls for improved governance, including implementation of the judicial reforms, public 
administration reform with the introduction of salary incentives and the adoption of a continuing 
training system, and the pursuing of decentralization with a clearer definition of the competencies of 
local authorities. Improving infrastructures is also a priority after years of underinvestment, in order 
to reduce the costs of production and transport, increase returns to private investment and facilitate 
exports. Investments to expand road, electricity generation, irrigation networks, modernize railways 
and enhance the functioning of energy markets, including through concessions and public-private 
partnerships (PPPs), are envisaged.

The fifth long term strategic goal of the government is to invest heavily in the education system. 
Improving access to and quality of education is key to ensure that youth are equipped with 
knowledge and skills that will help foster economic growth and improve FYR Macedonia’s prospects 
for EU membership. At the primary and secondary education levels, the goal is to increase school 
enrollment by addressing the direct and indirect constraints on attendance, bridging the outcome gaps 
between ethnicities, increase the level of teaching and learning, renovate schools to provide better 
learning environments, and expand access to and use of computer and internet technologies. In 
higher education, the government program needs to press ahead with reforming the curriculum to 
make it more relevant to the labor market, to fulfill the requirements of integration into the European 
higher education area, and to strengthen its research capacity. 

 WORLD BANK GROUP’S OBJECTIVES 

Consistent with government priorities and aiming to accelerate the country’s perspective of EU 
membership, the CPS07, proposed two strategic pillars of intervention:  (i) fostering job-creating 
economic growth and increasing living standards for all; and (ii) improving governance and 
transparency in public sector delivery to support a market economy. The $280 million program (in 
the high case scenario) intended to support the government’s wide ranging reform effort by 
combining the implementation of the existing lending program with a proposed new lending program 
for the following four years, comprising of a maximum of 10 new investment projects, as well as the 
completion of an ongoing three-year DPL program and the start of a new series of DPLs towards the 
end of the CPS period. A full program of analytical support and technical assistance was also 
designed to inform the government on future policy decisions in key economic and sectoral areas. 
The analysis of the country’s development challenges were developed collaboratively by the Bank 
and the government, based on the framework provided by the EU accession priorities and the first 
“Rebirth in 100 steps” manifesto. 

The CPS Progress Report (Report No. 47759-MK, dated March 4, 2009) introduced a revised 
and streamlined results matrix aligned with government priorities, with measurable indicators to 
guide program planning, country performance monitoring and portfolio performance monitoring. The 
revised matrix featured nine outcomes and thirty three milestones grouped under four outcome 
clusters to achieve cross-sector CPS synergies. The two pillars of the CPS, as well as the objective of 
supporting the country's aspiration of joining the EU, were reflected in each of these four outcome 
clusters. This reformulation did not change the development objectives, nor the substance of most 
indicators. 

The four clusters included:  

Growth and competitiveness:  increase the flexibility of the labor market and decrease the tax 
wedge, establish an efficient land administration system, and improve institutional capacity of 
agriculture sector public institutions in line with EU accession requirements 

Business environment: improve the business environment as measured by the Doing Business 
report, increase the efficiency of the judicial system and improve the courthouse infrastructure 

Human development: improve the school infrastructure and the quality of education in basic and 
secondary education, improve the efficiency and transparency of Health Insurance Fund operations 

42 

 
 
 
FY06-FY09 CPS Completion Report 

and the institutional and management capacity of the Ministry of Health, improve the administration 
and targeting of cash benefits and strengthen the pension system 

Infrastructure: improve the road and rail infrastructure and management capacity, improve 
efficiency and sustainability of the energy sector, improve local services and infrastructure in 
selected municipalities.  

Within the frame of the above mentioned clusters, and given the global financial crisis, the CPSPR 
maintained the flexibility to respond promptly and adequately to the evolving economic situation in 
the country and included the possibility for a DPL to support an endorsable policy response to the 
global economic crisis. 

ASSESSMENT OF CPS OUTCOMES BY CLUSTER 

Country Development Goal: Improve competitiveness and growth through appropriate policies 
and effective institutions. 

Program rating: Progress on improving competitiveness and growth is rated as Satisfactory.   

Outcome 1: Increase flexibility of labor market and decrease tax wedge 

The World Bank’s focus on this Outcome was in large part the result of assistance provided through 
the series of Programmatic Development Policy Loans (PDPL). The main component of the labor 
reform was the new Labor Law, which complemented the reforms that led to the transformation of 
enterprise ownership and increased labor market flexibility by expanding possibilities to use fixed-
term employment, including seasonal and part-time employment, removing most restrictions on 
work-hours as well as introducing voluntary participation to collective bargaining. Substantial 
amount of technical assistance underpinned the drafting and implementation of the new labor law, 
whose passage was widely supported by government as a key reform to enhance competitiveness. In 
addition, a Dutch Trust Fund (TF) provided assistance to improve the enforcement of the Labor Law 
by strengthening the capacities of the State Labor Inspectorate.  

In response to strong government demand, the Bank also produced a series of three policy notes on 
labor taxation, active labor market programs, and health insurance for the unemployed, as well as a 
labor market profile based on an analysis of Labor Force Survey data. The World Bank helped the 
Government select a set of good practices from a number of countries in the region, including 
Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia. With Bank support, the Law on Peaceful Resolution of Labor 
Disputes was prepared to facilitate the establishment of a new approach to labor relations between 
stakeholders. 

Outcome 2: Establish efficient land administration system.     

The Government made great strides in making the land administration system more efficient. 
The real estate cadastre (REC) is completed on 98 percent of the territory of the country, a new Law 
on Real Estate Cadastre has been promulgated that streamlined the land registration process, and 
significant changes were introduced in the management process and capacity of the Agency of Real 
Estate Cadastre (AREC), making it more efficient and client oriented. This resulted in steep increase 

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FY06-FY09 CPS Completion Report 

in the number of registered transactions (93,240 in 2009 compared to 42,116 in 2005), mortgages 
(114% increase compared to 2005) and reduction of shortening of the period for transaction 
registration (70% of all transactions are registered in one day and 30% between 3-8 days). Client 
surveys showed that the cadastre and AREC are not impediments to the real estate market as they 
were in 2004, but rather are supporting and helping the market to grow by providing the necessary 
security and an efficient service. 

The World Bank played a major role. The Real Estate Cadastre and Registration project provided 
financing and technical assistance needed for the establishment of the real estate cadastre. Together 
with the Swedish International Development Agency, the World Bank helped the transformation of 
the State Authority for Geodetic Works (SAGW) into a modern and efficient Agency for Real Estate 
Cadastre and improved service delivery in all local and regional offices. The project helped the 
Government take an organized approach to land policy, by initiating formation of Land Policy 
Advisory Committee and by financing land policy studies related to the security of tenure, access to 
land for investments, state land management, and study on illegally built objects, as well as an 
initiation of a state indemnity fund. The project has been complemented by the activities of the 
Sweden, Dutch, and Japanese governments, through a well developed coordination mechanism. 
Based on the success of the reform, the Government has asked for continuation of the project through 
Additional Financing, which has approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in 
May 2010.  

Outcome 3: Improve institutional capacity of agriculture sector public institutions in line with 
EU accession requirements. 

Given the importance of the agriculture sector for the development of the country, as well as for its 
EU accession efforts, the Government paid significant attention to enabling the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy (MAFWE) to formulate and implement effective policies 
and increase effectiveness of public expenditures in agriculture in an EU-compliant manner. The 
Agriculture Strengthening and Accession project, started in 2007, aims at building the institutions 
necessary to meet EU accession requirements and access and absorb pre-accession assistance, 
strengthen veterinary and phytosanitary capacity to meet EU food safety standards and alleviate 
irrigation-related constraints on productivity, by building on the ongoing reform of the irrigation 
sector conducted under the previous World Bank Irrigation Restructuring and Rehabilitation Project. 
World Bank assistance in this sector was informed by the Study on Agriculture and EU Accession, 
delivered in FY07. 

The progress of reforms in agriculture is satisfactory, despite the complexities the sector is facing. 
Through the World Bank assistance, MAFWE’s ability to deliver EU rural development funds has 
been increased – the European Commission conferred the right to manage the funds from the EU 
Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance in the area of the rural development (IPA Fifth Component 
–IPARD) to the FYR Macedonian operative structure assigned for IPARD. The progress in the 
development of effective veterinary capacity has resulted in (i) a reduction of the prevalence of 
brucellosis and tuberculosis, and an increase of vaccination coverage against classical swine fever, 
(ii) conduct of a preliminary screening and provisional classification of food establishments, and 
further steps for gradual upgrading to EU standards are being contemplated, and (iii) formal reports 
attesting that veterinary laboratories (animal health and food hygiene) are successfully pursuing 
accreditation of an increasing number of tests. Irrigation Water Communities (IWCs) have been 
formed in accordance with the agreement reached - to date, from a total of 33 IWCs planned, 16 

44 

 
 
 
 
 
FY06-FY09 CPS Completion Report 

IWCs covering around 12,550 ha of total service area have held founding meetings, and 10 IWCs 
covering around 1,300 ha total area are in process of registering. The progress is considered to 
proceed at an appropriate pace when compared with the progress under the previous World Bank-
financed irrigation project.  

MAFWE capacity building continues through the initiation of an Integrated Administration and 
Control System, particularly focusing on the Farm Registry and Land Parcel Information System; 
establishment of an Agriculture Information System including a Farm Accountancy Data Network 
and Market Information System; strengthening the Agricultural Inspection Services; and improving 
MAFWE’s capacity in areas such as agricultural policy analysis and by improving linkages between 
the regional offices and headquarters. This goal is planned to be accomplished primarily through 
upgrading and linking agricultural information and IT systems; provision of technical assistance 
during design and implementation; renovation of MAFWE facilities; logistical support, and staff 
training. 

Country Development Goal: Improve the business climate, reduce regulatory burden on 
businesses, ease entry of new businesses. 

Program rating: Progress on improving the business climate is rated as Satisfactory.   

Outcome 1: Improve business environment as measured by Doing Business report. 

Through specific measures under the PDPL series, FYR Macedonia was able to improve its ranking 
in the Doing Business survey, from 83 out of 125 in 2006 to 32 out of 185 in 2009.  At the same 

time, the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) 2008 results show 

improvements in a number of areas related to business environment.  The percentage of firms that 
reported licensing and permits as problems of doing business fell from 41 percent in 2005 to 34 
percent in 2008; 27 percent of firms identified customs and trade legislation as a problem in 2008 
compared to 37 percent in 2005. 

The authorities recognized that fast and affordable market entry is critical to successful market 
competition and launched a major reform, supported by the PDPL and other donors, which led to the 
adoption of the Law on Business Registration. The new legislation streamlined the registration by 
taking it out of the courts, combining a number of government agencies and reducing time, steps and 
costs required to start a business: (i) time to register a company was reduced from 3 days to 24 hours; 
(ii) cost of registering a business has been reduced to less than Euro 50, (iii) during the first half of 
2008, the number of registered companies increased for 6 percent and (iv) the country ranks 12th in 
the world on the Doing Business Starting a Business indicator. The active assistance of the Doing 
Business Reform Advisory services provided the necessary guidance in achieving these results. 

PDPL activities were complemented by the Business Environment Reform and Institutional 
Strengthening project (BERIS) that has the strengthening the capacity of the Government to improve 
selected areas of the business environment, directly responding to the relevant chapters of the EU 
Accession Negotiation requirements. The project financed the improvement of the Metrology, 
Standards, Testing and Quality infrastructure, improved the work processes at the Central Register16 

16 The Central Register of Republic of Macedonia is the single institution for registering companies, foreign 
representative offices, and other entities in the country. 

45 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
FY06-FY09 CPS Completion Report 

and services that address the enterprise sector’s difficulties in competing in domestic and foreign 
markets, improvements in the competition policy regime and improve access to information that 
increases transaction costs and/or impedes sound investment decisions.  
The Real Estate Cadastre and Registration project shortened the time for property registration (70% 
of all transactions are registered in one day and 30% between 3-8 days), which offered more 
opportunities for the creditors and resulted in increased number of mortgages (8,573 in 2008 
compared to 2,920 in 2005). 

A key part of creating the right business environment is proper financial reporting. FYR Macedonia 
joined “The Road to Europe - Program of Accounting Reform and Institutional Strengthening” 
(REPARIS) - a regional program aimed at creating a transparent policy environment and effective 
institutional framework for corporate reporting within South Central and South East Europe. 
REPARIS, developed by the Bank in close cooperation with the OECD and the European 
Commission and financed by the Dutch and Austrian Governments, offers training to senior civil 
servants, financial sector regulators and accounting and auditing bodies in emerging issues and new 
trends in both EU and global requirements impacting the regulation of accounting and auditing. 

On demand of the Government, a “one-stop-shop” approach was introduced that integrates Bank 
Group interventions designed to strengthen the business environment. A joint World Bank/IFC/FIAS 
business environment specialist was hired, a business environment core team was established, and 
the role of the World Bank Group approach on business environment services is being strengthened.   
During FY07-10, IFC invested around US$90 million, through the US$55.3 million post-
privatization loan to the Austrian owned electricity distribution company EVN and the US$34 
million loan to NLB Tutunska Banka, the country’s third largest bank, to support SME sector and 
facilitate export/imports through a trade finance guarantee facility. 
Within the frame of its work on the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), IFC provided assistance 
to the Ministry of Justice to prepare in 2006 the first Law on Mediation and in 2009 its amendments.  
IFC also has supported the establishment of the Chamber of Mediators and helped with training of 
over 120 mediators, 60 lawyers, and 40 judges. As a result of mediation, over US$3.5 million are 
released and returned to the economy.   
Since 2006, IFC has been supporting Securities and Exchange Commission and Stock Exchange to 
develop the Corporate Governance Code and supervisory tools. As a result, over 200 entities 
received tailored advisory services, including one-on-one trainings to 80 companies and in-house 
support to 15 companies to improve their governance policies and practices.  IFC also supported 
inclusion of corporate governance in regular university curricula. As a result, the reporting towards 
Securities and Exchange Commission is improved and over US$4 million additional capital was 
raised for client companies.  
IFC has been active in addressing the lack of information and resources regarding international 
standards and technical regulations in FYR Macedonia. To promote international standards IFC has 
organized over 50 various events with 1000 individuals including 9 topical trainings approved by 
International Register for Certified Auditors (IRCA). As a result, 100 individuals passed the relevant 
exams and being able to enter the consultancy standards market in the country. In addition, IFC 
supported 11 companies to implement various new standards resulting in increased sales by US$120 
million and increased export by US$90 million.

Outcome 2: Reduce the burden of regulation on businesses 

In order to clean up the legal framework from legislation that was constraining business activity, the 
Government, through its General Secretariat, established the Committee for Regulatory Reform 
(CRR), and performed a stocktaking of more than 2,000 laws and bylaws.  The model of the 
“Regulatory Guillotine” worked effectively in reducing unnecessary regulations.  Following the 
review of the legislation the CRR, determined whether it was sensible to retain, modify or eliminate 
them.  The process involved extensive dialog with the ministries, each of which had working groups, 
and the private sector.  In the first round of the guillotine, the Government identified 64 Laws and 
481 by-laws which were supposed to be amended or eliminated, which it than translated into 5 
packages of measures. By September 2009, the Parliamentary procedure for amending 39 of the 64 
laws was completed.  At the same time, 382 of 481 by-laws had been abolished or amended through 
Ministerial decrees.  The second phase of the “guillotine” is underway.     

The regulatory guillotine included the reduction in fees, number of required forms and other 
documentation in Government agencies critical to doing business, such as the Cadastre and the 
Central Registry.  One of its biggest accomplishments was the introduction of the “silence is 
consent” principle in dealing with the administration, basically stipulating that if the administration 
does not respond to a certain request within certain timeframe, the client should consider it cleared.  
Implementing this principle required amending the Law on Administrative procedures. 

The regulatory reform was intended also to prevent the build-up of new legislation that may be 
hampering business activity through the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), which is the third 
phase of regulatory reforms.  The RIA was officially launched on January 1, 2009 and its 
implementation was supported by the Bank’s BERIS and the UK’s GOFRA projects.  Among other 
things, the RIA requires that all new laws undergo a regulatory impact assessment to ensure that the 
benefits of the law outweigh its costs.  This effort is in line with EU accession efforts and represents 
a deepening of the PDPL supported reforms. 

Outcome 3: Increase the efficiency of judicial system and improve courthouse infrastructure 

Judicial reform is identified as one of key priorities by the Government, the private sector and one of 
key reform areas required for the country’s progress toward accession to the European Union. 
Through the PDPL series and associated Legal and Judicial Improvement and Institutional Support 
project, the improvement to the judicial legal framework included, inter alia:  

(i) reduced backlog and delays in court proceedings trough the adoption of a new Law on Civil 
Procedure that streamlined case processing including delivery of summons and case hearings, and 
shortened civil proceedings by ending unlimited recusal requests and requests for continuances. The 
new Law on Courts established a more effective organization of the court system including setting up 
of an Administrative Court and allowing for specialization within courts. At the same, the 
Constitutional Amendments and the new Law on Misdemeanors, the Law on General Administrative 
Procedure and the subsequent changes to a number of sector laws have allowed agencies to issue 
misdemeanor sanctions without court action, thus freeing the courts from thousands of cases. As a 
result, the backlog of these cases fell by 576 cases from June 2005 to June 2007 with 22 of the 27 
basic courts recording a reduction in backlogs;  

47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FY06-FY09 CPS Completion Report 

ii) improvement of judicial infrastructure through completed refurbishment of 9 court houses in cities 
throughout the country (and two additional refurbishment underway). The construction of new 
Criminal Court in Skopje is underway;  

iii) improved enforcement of court judgments by supporting the adoption of the Law on Enforcement 
that took enforcement out of the courts and placed the function in the hands of private bailiffs. 
Managing of cases has improved and enforcement of court cases increased from 18 percent in 2005 
to 39 percent in 2009;  

iv) improved regulatory and implementation framework for bankruptcy cases through the adoption of 
a new Bankruptcy Law which revamped the bankruptcy procedures by changing the role of the 
trustee, the bankruptcy process and introducing more transparency and oversight, resulting in average 
fall of duration of bankruptcy procedures from 3 years and seven months to two years and two 
months, as well as technical assistance provided to the Chamber of Trustees;  

v) increased transparency and fairness of administrative agency decisions was supported through the 
adoption of the new Law on General Administrative Procedures which introduced international 
standards of transparency, fairness and due process, along with the establishment of the 
Administrative Court which took over jurisdiction for administrative cases from the Supreme Court;  

vi) increased institutional capacity to implement and monitor reforms by strengthening the General 
Administrative Office in order to create capacity within the judiciary for the implementation and 
monitoring of the comprehensive reforms agenda;  

(vii) installation of a Case Management Information System all courts is underway, through joint 
financing of USAID and the World Bank.  

These reforms, also assisted by the European Commission and USAID, are beginning to show 
results. According to the BEEPS 2008, the percentage of firms that find the courts to be a problem of 
doing business declined from 55 percent in 2005 to 50 percent in 2008.   

Meanwhile, the IFC has been working since 2004 to support legislation reform through the 
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program in FYR Macedonia.  With the Ministry of Justice as 
main partner, the law on Mediation was passed, as well as a by-law on the Training Program for 
Mediators. In addition, training for 60 mediators, 60 lawyers and 15 judges have been delivered, 
several round tables and one ADR Conference for promotion of usage of mediation has been 
organized, and an extensive and far-reaching PR campaign has been undertaken.  

Country Development Goal: Improve the effectiveness of education, health and social 
protection reforms. 
Program rating: The overall progress of the program is rated Moderately Satisfactory, although 
the results varied across projects. 

Outcome 1: Improve school infrastructure and quality of education in basic and secondary 
education. 

Improvement of school infrastructure has been financed through the Education Modernization 
Project (financed through a US$5 mil IBRD loan and US$12,5 mil Dutch trust fund) with dual 

48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FY06-FY09 CPS Completion Report 

objective: (i) to improve quality of learning and participation at the targeted schools by strengthening 
school level planning and management and (ii) improved equity and efficiency for a decentralized 
education system. The project helped the country respond to the challenges of creating a quality, 
decentralized education system by: (i) establishing a school self-evaluation process; an evaluation 
performed by the State Education Inspectorate; and a nationally administrated assessment of student 
achievement, which provides data about the quality of the education system; (ii) introducing 
medium- and long-term planning at both central administration and school levels and (iii) providing 
community-based School Improvement Grants to all 427 primary and secondary schools to improve 
infrastructure, strengthen student security and hygiene, and provide teacher training and teaching 
aids. 
The project financed the establishment of National Education Management System (EMIS) - a tool 
designed to monitor education service delivery and outputs, and resource flows, and helps to 
strengthen partnerships between all levels of authorities and operations. It is expected for the EMIS 
to be fully functional in the second half of 2010. 

As a result of the above efforts, the secondary enrollment increased to 95 percent from 85 percent, 
and dropout rates decreased to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent between 2004 and 2008. A market for 
teachers’ training has been established, along with criteria for accreditation and monitoring of teacher 
training services. Also, the State Matura examination, the national assessment of student 
achievement, was given 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 2008 
in 
all 
four-year 
schools. 
From 2004 to 2007, 48.8 percent of school managers and teachers reported improvements in 
students’ achievements, 60.7 percent saw improvement in planning and assessment processes, and 
28.5 
percent 
confirmed 
that 
attendance 
and 
participation 
of 
students 
improved. 

Outcome 2: Improve efficiency and transparency of Health Insurance Fund operations and 
institutional and management capacity of Ministry of Health  

Through the Health Sectorm Management project and the new DPL series, a strong reform 
effort has considerably improved the sustainability of the health sector. The Health Insurance 
Law was amended to streamline the operations, decision-making and transparency of the Board of 
Directors of the HIF. The competitive procurement of pharmaceuticals (an important achievement of 
a previous DPL series) resulted in considerable savings. Most recently, the HIF board has decided to 
institute reference pricing and stronger controls over spending were institutionalized. The preparation 
for launching bundled pricing for acute inpatient services based on Diagnostic Related Groups (or 
DRGs) is well advanced and will further rationalize capacity in the hospital sector. However, in order 
for hospitals to be prepared to function under output-based financing, financial management and 
service delivery arrangements (level of autonomy over budget, hiring and firing), and capacity must 
be enhanced (for example, currently, the majority of Health Care Institutions have very high fixed 
costs (over 80 percent for salaries) which leave little for purchasing other inputs for service delivery. 
More balanced budget allocations will require capacity rationalization, especially on human 
resources and use of more contracted staff. 

Outcome 3: Improve administration and targeting of cash benefits and strengthen pension 
system 

The effectiveness and efficiency of the social protection system has been increased. The Social 
Protection Implementation Loan (SPIL) has addressed the major steps towards the finalization of the 
Pension reform agenda (introduction of the mandatory fully funded pension system, development of 

49 

 
 
 
 
 
 
FY06-FY09 CPS Completion Report 

a framework for voluntary funded pension scheme, new system of collection and record keeping of 
pension contributions implemented on individual basis, etc). The reform of social cash benefits will 
introduce a redesigned and streamlined system of social cash benefits, based on automation of 
business processes and unification of registries of beneficiaries with web based software to be 
developed. The Management Information System for the cash benefits will be the most crucial 
investment in the improved administration practices, inspections and controls.  

The work in the social policy area was underpinned with technical assistance that helped develop the 
Law on Social Protection that should set the basis for the harmonization of benefits, the Law on 
fully-funded pension pillar and the Law on privately funded pension pillar, as well as changes in the 
Pension Law. 

At the same time, SPIL was a major pre-requisite for the new Conditional Cash Transfer Project – 
CCT (FY09). The CCT will build on the activities initiated under the SPIL in order to continue 
strengthening country’s social safety net through improvements in the administration, oversight, 
monitoring, and evaluation of social assistance transfers. CCT will also support Government’s efforts 
to develop and introduce conditional cash transfer programs. The adoption of suitable policy 
framework for the improved functioning of the social safety net system has also been supported 
through the new series of DPL (FY10). Due to the complexity of the design of the system and issues 
related to the system developer, the establishment of the integrated management and information 
system covering all cash benefit programs and all beneficiaries has been delayed, which induced a 
delay in the introduction of the first CCT program. 

Country Development Goal: Increase the capacity of road and rail transport and lower trade 
and transport related transaction costs, improve the efficiency and sustainability of the energy 
sector, improve local infrastructure. 

Program rating: The overall progress of the program is rated Moderately Satisfactory, although 
the results in transport and energy sectors varied across projects.   

Outcome 1: Improve road and rail infrastructure and management capacity. 

Improvements are being made to the rail and road infrastructure and management systems, 
leading to reduced cost of access to markets and services.  This has been made possible by policy 
and institutional reforms and infrastructure investments undertaken under the Railway Reform 
Project - RRP (FY06), the Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project – TTFSE2 (FY07) and 
the Regional and Local Roads Program Support Project – RLRPSP (FY08). 

The RRP had the challenge of helping transform a rail sector that was heavily in debt with declining 
operational capacities at the beginning of CPS07 into one that would be operating more efficiently 
within policy, legal and institutional arrangements that are in conformity with EU Directives. Whilst 
all the challenges have not been met, much has been achieved directly under RRP or indirectly 
through advisory support by the Bank team: (i) the former Macedonian Railways has been divided 
into a Rail Infrastructure Company (MR-I) and a Rail Transport Joint Stock Company (MR-T), some 
staff reductions undertaken during the process and a plan for further reductions elaborated;  (ii) the 
railway infrastructure is now open to use by private operators with a Track Access Charges system 
introduced; (iii) the MR-I has published the Network Statement describing the transport services 
available, the characteristics of the railway network, the level of track access charge, and the 

50 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FY06-FY09 CPS Completion Report 

conditions for contracting transport services on the railway infrastructure in compliance with EU 
Directives; (iv)  the basis for the payment by the Government for passenger services provided by 
MR-T (Public Service Contracts) has been defined and under implementation; (v) a number of new 
legislation have been adopted (e.g. Railway Law, Transport Safety, contracts for carriage by rail, 
transport of dangerous goods, Railway Agency, etc.) that should lead to a more commercial approach 
to the provision of rail services in the country.  Further to this, the process has started for establishing 
an independent Regulatory Agency for rail services and a detailed action plan prepared with the help 
of the Bank on necessary key steps for deepening the reform. As a result of these reforms, the 
railway system is in conformity with the EU accession requirements. 

The Second Trade and Transport Facilitation project (FY07) is financing the (i) upgrade to motorway 
standards of the last stretch of road between the capital of Skopje and the main border crossing 
between FYR Macedonia and Serbia (corridor X), which is expected to e completed by end 2010, (ii) 
renovation of the main border crossing with Kosovo (Corridor X) – to be completed by Spring 2011. 
As part of its activities, the project financed the establishment of the telecommunication system for 
the exchange of train information between railways and customs. Reduction of non-tariff constraints 
is expected to result in lower transport and trade transaction costs and consequently the reduction of 
the economic distance to markets for exporters/traders. Project activities have been delayed due to 
different resettlement and land acquisition issues, further complicated by low capacity of the Agency 
for State Roads (ASR).  

The improvement of the road network in the country continues with the Regional and Local Roads 
Program Support Project (FY08), which finances rehabilitation of around 330km of regional roads 
(about 8.7% of all regional roads) and around 420km of local roads (5% of all local roads), thus 
contributing to reduced cost of access to markets and services for communities served by regional 
and local roads. The rehabilitation of three of the regional roads has been completed, while the other 
regional roads are to be completed before the end of 2010. The project also provides for assistance to 
the ASR to improve its institutional capacity through trainings on road asset management tools and 
road safety audit.  

Outcome 2: Improve efficiency and sustainability of the energy sector 

The energy stability has improved. With World Bank assistance through the regional ECSEE 
APL3 project, MEPSO (the public electric power transmission company) has increased the capacity 
of the transmission network through completion of the power transmission line to Greece, and 
restoration of 38 transformation stations throughout the country, including the main power 
transformation station for the capital of Skopje. This work led to significant reduction of technical 
losses and increase of the stability of the power system in general. During the CPS period, the Bank 
provided technical assistance, through Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) to the 
Energy Regulatory Commission to improve and clarify the electricity regulation.  

While the World Bank assistance was instrumental in improving the energy stability, the work in the 
area of energy efficiency and renewable energy lagged behind. The lack of attention of the 
Government in the early years of the CPS07 implementation, and the overly complex design of the 
associated Sustainable Energy project, financed by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), led to 
significant delays in both the reform and project implementation.

The Government and the World Bank restructured the GEF project which focuses on supporting the 
Government’s sustainable energy agenda and in particular the implementation of the National 
Program for Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings.   

Outcome 3: Improve local services and infrastructure in selected municipalities 

The World Bank helped the Government achieve some important progress and avert backtracking in 
decentralization trough the PDPL series.  The objective to create stable and financially viable local 
governments required that municipalities get sufficient and predictable financial resources, but also 
more important financial management practices and incentives are introduced to avoid build-up of 
contingent liabilities and institutional issues are resolved to ensure smooth devolution of 
responsibilities. 

PDPL helped establish a stable and transparent mechanism for financing local government by 
promoting and adoption of fair formula that transfers portion of the personal income tax and value 
added tax revenues to municipalities. These revenues now constitute a significant part of the revenue 
base of local governments. With the main issue being the arrears faced by municipalities, the 
Government, with support through the PDPL maintained a no bailout policy.  Cumulatively, 60 
municipalities (out of 83 municipalities in the country) were able to settle arrears by end-2007 and 70 
by end-2008.  Thus, 16 municipalities have not yet cleared their arrears, which mean that all capital 
expenditures are blocked by the Treasury and that they cannot enter the second phase of 
decentralization.  In the second phase of decentralization, Municipalities have increased financial 
autonomy and they are responsible for using block grants to pay teachers’ salaries.  Arrears fell from 
around MKD5 billion to around MKD2 billion in 2007 and MKD800 million by the end of 2008. 

Further assistance to the decentralization process has been availed through the Education 
Modernization Project. The purpose of the School Improvement Grants, received by each school, has 
been decided by the community itself, thereby serving as capacity building vehicle for the 
municipalities.  

In FY09, the World Bank approved the Municipal Services Improvement Project (MSIP), with an 
aim to further assists the decentralization process by improving the transparency, financial 
sustainability and delivery of targeted municipal services  in the participating municipalities. It will 
provide sub-loans to municipalities for investments in revenue-generating public services and other 
high priority investment projects, as well as technical assistance grants for sub-project preparation, 
local capacity building for municipalities and Communal Service Enterprises (CSEs), and national 
level Institutional strengthening.

BANK PERFORMANCE 

The CPS proposed a lending program of US$220 million to US$280 million. The CPS 
envisaged lending comprising up to three development policy operations, nine investment 
operations, and one project supported by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Two 
investment lending operations were left undetermined for FY10, with the expectation that the 
lending program would be reviewed during the CPSPR to ensure that World Bank support 
remains fully responsive to evolving country needs.  

The World Bank remained highly responsive to the needs of the country. Responding 
flexibly to evolving government priorities, the Regional and Local Roads project was brought 
forward a year and significantly increased to US$105 million, and the Conditional Cash Transfer 
project was moved to FY09. The Technological Change and Higher Education project may be 
considered in the next CPS. These projects complement eight ongoing operations approved 
between FY04 and FY06 in land administration, transport, energy, education, and health. The 
Municipal Services Improvement project was the last investment operation to be approved in late 
FY09. In order to enable the country to better weather out the consequences of the global 
financial crisis, a new DPL was prepared and approved in FY10, expanding the lending program 
to US$292 million. As a result of the good collaboration and Bank’s responsiveness, project 
preparations was short and there were no effectiveness delays. IEG evaluated the ICRs for the 
PDPL series, consisting of three loans, and found the outcome, the Bank and the Borrower 
performances to be satisfactory, while the Risk to Development Outcome was rated moderate. 

As of June 2010, FYR Macedonia’s active portfolio consists of 14 projects, with total 
commitments of US$319.7 million, of which US$201 remains undisbursed. Commitments at 
risk, a measure of the likelihood that projects will not meet their stated development objectives 
on time, increased from zero in FY07 to 12 percent at end-FY10. Four projects are rated 
Satisfactory on both IP and DO, and one is rated HS. Six projects are rated MS on either IP or 
DO or both and three have an MU rating. Disbursement ratio is at 17.4 percent and is slightly 
below ECA average. Key factors for the decline of the portfolio quality and low disbursement 
performance include: (i) overly complex project design, (ii) weak capacity of Government 
institutions in charge of underachieving projects, (iii) poor managerial practices - changes of 
project management teams, and lack of coordination among key players involved in project 
implementation.

In keeping with the World Bank’s MIC strategy, the CPS gave prominence to “just-in-
time” analytical and advisory assistance. Analytic work provided opportunities for stocktaking 
and raising awareness of key issues, as well as pointing the way to approaches that could be 
adopted by the Government. World Bank core reports strengthened authorities’ understanding of 
key fiscal and economic challenges: an assessment of financial management and public 
procurement systems through the FY08 Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFA); an analysis of 
public expenditures in key sectors through the FY08 Public Expenditure Review (PER); and an 
analysis of factors underlying economic growth through the FY09 Country Economic 
Memorandum (CEM). In most cases, core analytical support was provided as originally 
scheduled in the CPS. It was well appreciated by the Government and relevant stakeholders, 
which was also proven thorough the Client Survey - the Bank is rated strongly (7.6 out of 10) in 
terms of building capacity and strengthening institution. Further efforts need to be put into a 
wider dissemination of the reports and usage of more recent data in the core ESW. 

Targeted, on-demand and timely sector analyses proved to have higher ownership of 
different stakeholders. The World Bank was highly responsive to requests of the Government – 
hence, the CPS-anticipated general Land Policy Note gave way to more focused studies on 
Access to Land for Investments and Security of Land Tenure, the Land Market Study, the Illegal 
Objects Study, the Pilot exercise on inventory of state land in urban Strumica. These studies 
informed the new Law on Real Estate Cadastre and Registration. The FY09 Policy Note on

Crisis Response helped the Government adjust policies to mitigate the consequences of the 
global economic crisis and informed the DPL dialogue. World Bank teams also developed the 
Municipal Development Sector Note, which helped prepare the Municipal Services Improvement 
project, Labor Market Policy Notes, as well as number of sectoral policy notes related to 

specific, narrowly focused fields (for ex. Overview of Sectoral Issues and Needs in Higher 
Education and Research for Future Interventions (FY10) or the Technical Note on the Current Status 
of the FYR Macedonian railway sector and Recommendations for improving the Operational and 
Financial Performance). The World Bank financed the development of the Industrial Policy Strategy 
in 2009 (the first of its kinds since independence in 1991). The aim of the plan is to align industrial 
policy with the EU’s Lisbon growth and jobs strategy, increase the competitiveness of the national 
economy and build a knowledge-based society. The policy focuses on five areas: promoting foreign 
direct investment (FDI); increasing resources for research, development and innovation, developing 
eco-friendly technologies, products and services; encouraging of small and medium-size enterprises 
(SMEs); and establishing of clusters.  

The CPS expressed the desire of the World Bank and the government to move towards 
greater reliance on country processes in procurement and financial management. Country 
systems are already being used in some areas of project financial management and the World 
Bank has included FYR Macedonia as a pilot country where procurement regulation may be used 
in Bank financed projects. 

LESSONS LEARNED 

The focus of the FY07–10 CPS on supporting the efforts of the FYR Macedonia to join the EU 
has been appropriate and has well served the country’s development objectives. In assisting the 
country in meeting the accession criteria and implementing the EU acquis communautaire, which has 
major implications on budget allocation and priorities, the World Bank Group has espoused the 
government overarching priority and helped accelerate the run-up to accession.  The perspective of 
opening membership talks has been the driving force behind the government efforts, and has led to 
reforms ranging from agricultural development and food safety to the functioning of public 
administration and civil service. This commitment EU-inspired reforms has facilitated the Bank’s 
portfolio implementation. The Bank’s funding has also served as a critical bridge financing to enable 
FYR Macedonia to access EU pre-accession funds and has contributed to build the institutional 
capacity to effectively implement EU-compatible standards and regulations. 

Looking ahead, the World Bank Group could be more selective in its assistance strategy, 
focusing on a limited set of objectives, better exploiting synergies and privileging larger 
operations. While the range of the World Bank Group strategy and the choice of addressing 
numerous sectors have allowed putting forth a number of issues and giving them government 
recognition at the highest level, the relatively small scale of its program would call for greater 
selectivity for an increased impact. With the limited resources of the Bank, it is difficult to 
thoroughly address all the issues at hand.  The current portfolio’s numerous projects with relatively 
low financing amounts suggest giving more consideration to consolidating and scaling-up operations.  
The FY11-FY14 CPS could focus on key themes that cut across the board and avoid exclusive sector 
approaches. It should also and be selective in the themes for full engagement. A selective and 
prioritized agenda would help focus World Bank Groups’ and country resources on achieving 
substantive results rather than dispersed incremental gains. The next strategy could achieve a mix of 

55 

 
 
 
FY06-FY09 CPS Completion Report 

interventions in areas with strong delivery potential with a presence in key strategic areas where 
progress has lagged. 

Ensuring Continuity and Flexibility. The implementation of the CPS07 represented a shift in the 
nature of the relationship between the World Bank Group and FYR Macedonia from one of 
assistance to one of partnership. Gradually, this led directly to adoption by the Bank of a more 
flexible approach on programming of activities and lending. World Bank Group flexibility was 
shown through adapting the program was shown through adapting the scope of the program in the 
second half of CPS period (adaptation of the DPL to mitigate the consequences of the global 
financial crisis, additional financing for cadastre project to respond to Government’s request for 
further reforms). However, even with the flexible and client-responsive approach that drove program 
adaptation, the three pillars structuring the CPS remained valid throughout the program period and 
were confirmed in the CPS Progress Report. This flexible approach has allowed the Bank Group to 
make greater contributions to FYR Macedonia’s development and has meant a better client-focused 
program, and should continue to be a cornerstone of the new CPS. 

World Bank Group synergy. The implementation of the later years of CPS07 saw a closer 
collaboration between IBRD and IFC facilitated through the introduction of the one-stop-shop 
position for Business Environment issues. The broadened IFC program made important contributions 
in the areas of advisory services and the energy and business environment sectors. In these areas, the 
Bank has usually taken the lead in strategic investments and analytical exercises (through the DPL 
series and investment operations) or policy advice, while the IFC-through its advisory services-has 
focused on more operational assistance, offering advice and supporting the implementation of 
reforms. The new CPS should continue to foster and further strengthen this synergy, including early 
involvement of Bank staff in the initial conceptual phase of IFC’s advisory services projects and 
consulting IFC in the preparation of analytical pieces by the World Bank. This collaboration will 
strengthen the position of the World Bank Group in the country and should continue to be one of the 
central elements in the new CPS. 

Efforts to jointly review and monitor CPS implementation have paid dividends and should 
continue over the next CPS.  The Bank and the Government established a successful collaborative 
mechanism for monitoring portfolio implementation.  Each quarter the Ministry of Finance and Bank 
staff prepare a CPS Implementation Stocktaking Tool.  This Tool outlines short and medium term 
portfolio milestones, identifies key bottlenecks, and proposes actions to be taken by the Bank and the 
Government.  The portfolio is then discussed at regular government sessions, and the conclusions of 
discussions are communicated to the Bank as well as all Ministries in form of a government decree.   

Simpler project design and more realistic outcomes could ensure greater efficiency in project 
implementation. While project preparation has seemed to be thorough and in line with government s 
expectations, some projects have proved to be too ambitious in their scope, some of them featuring a 
multiplicity of components loosely linked to each other. The government’s implementation capacity 
has not always been sufficiently taken into account, causing some overly complex project to face 
implementation delays. An in-depth assessment of available capacity, grounded in the political and 
institutional realities of the FYR Macedonia and which could have contributed to simpler designs, 
has been lacking in some cases. This “Christmas tree approach” has left some related PIUs struggling 
with which component to prioritize and which line ministry to interact with.  Projects also need to 
plan realistic implementation timeframes in order to avoid late extension requests.

DONOR COORDINATION 

The World Bank has partnered with the EC to help authorities to better coordinate and leverage 
external resources and to increase the synergies of donor assistance. The Government has adopted a 
pragmatic approach to donor coordination that aims to introduce program-based approaches in a few 
key sectors of major importance to EU accession. In addition, the World Bank has been promoting 
close collaboration with other development partners, including through co-funding of World Bank 
projects, such as in education, by bilateral partners, particularly the Austrian, Dutch, French and 
Swedish Governments.  

This approach was based on an evaluation in 2007 of aid coordination in FYR Macedonia that 
identified burdens and obstacles to aid effectiveness. Significant differences in policies, reporting 
requirements and methodologies among donors and the Government were found, illustrated by a 
misalignment of donor priorities and the country needs, the inconsistency of the country’s procedures 
in procurement and financial reporting with donors practices, a weak institutionalization of donor 
coordination, and information gaps leading to duplication of efforts in some instances.  

Moreover, the country has not been able, with the flowing of ODA during the last decade, to avoid 
the build-up of multiple sets of donor procedures, accounting requirements and uncoordinated 
activities. This can be primarily attributed to the fact that the coordination agenda is driven by the set 
of requirements imposed by the IPA accession process required by a single donor (the EU). This 
implies a better alignment of the other donors policies and a greater understanding of how they can 
adapt to the EU agenda, which the Bank has tried to do in the period covered by this CPS. The 
coordination body (the Secretariat for European Affairs) has also just started to assume a greater role, 
serving as a gate-keeper for all technical cooperation. Its capacity to fulfill this function and its links 
with the Ministry of Finance are being consolidated.  

In light of these findings, and in order to improve ownership, harmonization, alignment and 
accountability of aid, a working group of international donors (European Commission, European 
Agency for Reconstruction, United Nations, World Bank, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, 
Switzerland, United Kingdom, USA) was established on December 2007 to prepare a proposal for 
donor coordination.  What originated was an action plan to introduce a program-based (PBA) 
approach in FYR Macedonia to improve aid effectiveness via a strengthened Government-led 
coordination mechanism.  This action plan, adopted in 2009, is driven by (i) by the EU accession 
process, (ii) an explicit commitment of external partners to align support and results frameworks, (iii) 
a targeted effort to strengthen institutional capacity for results-based sector strategy implementation 
and coordination of external assistance, and (iv) the need for an effective and formalized structure for 
dialogue and coordination.  

As a result of this approach, PBA implementation plans are now being developed for 5 priority 
program areas picked by the government : Business environment, competitiveness, innovation, 
Human capital (education, social policy, health), Agriculture, Environment, and Governance (public 
administration, decentralization, regional development, justice and home affairs). An institutional 
framework for PBA was set up in parallel, with joint senior level working groups conducting an 
assessment of each priority sector and reporter to the line minister, a joint government/donors 
working group chair by the Secretary for European Affairs, and periodic high-level coordination 
meetings chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister.

FY06-FY09 CPS Completion Report 

Business climate surveys indicated 
that the most serious obstacles to 
private sector development 
include: an inefficient and opaque 
judicial system, legal uncertainty 
and lack of confidence in the 
judicial system. 

The effectiveness of the judicial system has been improved. 
According to the BEEPS 2008, the percentage of firms that 
find the courts to be a problem of doing business declined 
from 55 percent in 2005 to 50 percent in 2008, due to 
improvements in, inter alia, enforcement of court judgments 
and in regulatory and implementation framework for 
bankruptcy cases, improved court infrastructure, increase in 
transparency and fairness of administrative agency 
decisions, strengthening the General Administrative Office 
in order to create capacity within the judiciary for the 
implementation and monitoring of the comprehensive 
reforms agenda, and installation of a new Case 
Management Information System.  
Cluster III. Human Development

Between 2004 and 2008, secondary enrollment increased to 
decentralizing education 
95 percent from 85 percent, and dropout rates decreased to 
administration to municipalities, 
1.9 percent from 2.1 percent. A market for teachers’ 
improving teachers’ professional

The Health Insurance Fund faced 
enormous challenges with regard 
to the efficiency of its operations. 
The Ministry of Health had low 
institutional and management 
capacity. 

A strong reform effort has considerably improved the 
sustainability of the health sector. The Health Insurance 
Law was amended to streamline the operations, decision-
making and transparency of the HIF. The HIF instituted 
reference pricing and stronger controls over spending. The 
preparation for launching bundled pricing for acute 
inpatient services based on Diagnostic Related Groups is 
well advanced and will further rationalize capacity in the 
hospital sector.  

Country’s pension and social 
protection systems suffered from 
the poor efficiency of the system 
institutions, which led poor 
targeting for social welfare and 
low effectiveness of the pension 
system. 

Mandatory fully funded pension system is introduced, a 
framework for voluntary funded pension scheme is 
developed, and new system of collection and record 
keeping of pension contributions is implemented. The 
reform of social cash benefits is introducing a redesigned 
and streamlined system of social cash benefits, based on 
automation of business processes and unification of 
registries of beneficiaries with web based software to be 
developed. The work in the social policy area was 
underpinned with technical assistance that helped develop

border crossing with Kosovo is being renovated. Around 
330km of regional and around 420km of local roads are 
being rehabilitated, thus contributing to reduced cost of 
access to markets and services for communities served by 
regional and local roads.  
The capacity of the transmission network has been 
increased through completion of the power transmission 
line to Greece, restoration of 38 transformation stations 
throughout the country, including the main power 
transformation station for the capital of Skopje. This work 
led to significant reduction of technical losses and increase 
of the stability of the power system in general. During the 
CPS period, the Bank provided technical assistance, 
through Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility to 
the Energy Regulatory Commission to improve and clarify 
the electricity regulation. 
A stable and transparent mechanism for financing local 
government has been established through a formula that 
transfers portion of the personal income tax and value 
added tax revenues to municipalities. The Government 
maintained a no bailout policy with regard to the arrears of 
the municipalities.  As a result of the above actions, 70 
municipalities (out of 83 in the country) were able to settle 
arrears by end-2008.  Arrears fell from around MKD5 
billion to around MKD800 million by the end of 2008. 

The post-conflict Ohrid 
Agreement specifically called for 
a decentralization of power, which 
posed significant challenges to the 
capacity of the municipalities, in 
form of having transparent and 
stable financing mechanisms, and 
improvement of local services and 
infrastructure.  

FYR Macedonia’s energy sector 
went through significant changes 
over the CPS period, including 
privatization of the distribution 
network, relatively low capacity of 
the Energy Regulator, as well as a 
transmission network in need of 
significant improvements.

ANNEX 4: GENDER ASSESSMENT 

FYR Macedonia has continued making progress in advancing gender equity. The 2005 Labor Code 
endorses the definition of gender-based discrimination and provides a framework for anti-
discrimination measures. The Law on Equal Opportunities was adopted in May 2006 and this was 
followed by establishment of a special Parliamentary commission on equal opportunities in 
September 2006 and a Department for equal opportunities within the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Policy (MLSP) in March 2007. Over the last year all Ministries established Coordinators for equal 
opportunities, and at the local level the majority of municipalities have established commissions on 
equal opportunities. The 2nd National Action Plan for Gender Equality was adopted by the 
Government in 2007 and the operational plan was adopted in January 2009  
The electoral code provides that at least 1/3 of the nominated persons in the election process have to 
be women. Internationally, FYR Macedonia scores well on representation of women in government. 
The number of female counselors at the local government level increased from 8.4 percent in 2000 to 
22.4 percent  in 2005 and further to 27 percent in the 2009 local elections. At the national level, the 
number of female Parliamentarians increased from 17.5 percent to 28.3 percent during the same 
period. Nonetheless, participation of women in public life, especially at decision making levels and 
executive functions, is still relatively low. No female Mayor was elected in the recent local elections, 
and there are only two female Ministers in the National Government. 
Second generation gender issues have also been addressed by the Government. Namely the strategy 
for prevention of domestic violence was adopted by the Government in 2008. In addition, referral 
protocols for service providers such as shelters were developed. Nine shelters (three more compared 
to 2007) for victims of violence were opened - six operated by the MLSP and three by the civil 
sector. The MLSP maintains one SOS phone line, while additional three are maintained by NGOs. A 
National Coordination Body, representing relevant line ministries and stakeholders (civil society 
organizations) was established to monitor implementation of the Strategy to Combat Domestic 
Violence. 
Figure 1 below presents selected indicators of gender achievements and gender inequality in terms of 
education, labor market performance and health. The figure benchmarks FYR Macedonia, (in blue) 
against the Western Balkans (in yellow) and the ECA region (in pink).17 As all figures are 
standardized to the ECA average, it is easy to see the areas where FYR Macedonia and the Western 
Balkans perform differently from the rest of the region.  

Indicators of education performance suggest that there is no gender disadvantage in terms of 
secondary enrollment (as is the case for primary enrollment).  For tertiary education, in FYR 
Macedonia, as in the rest of the Western Balkans, female enrollment is much lower than the ECA 
average; nevertheless, more female than males are enrolled.  Looking at selected health indicators, 
FYR Macedonia appears to be doing extremely well in terms of maternal mortality (with rates which 
are 1/4 of the ECA average and about 1/3 of the Western Balkans average. In terms of adolescent 
fertility rates FYR Macedonia is at the ECA average, though other countries in the sub-region appear 
to be doing better. Finally, labor participation and the female share in the total labor force are lower 
than both the ECA average and the Western Balkans’. The share of women employed in the non-

17 The indicators presented are limited by data availability. For the sake of comparability the indicators refer to the 
latest year for which the indicators are available for the majority of the countries being compared. The data 
referred to in this figure, therefore, might not be the most updated for Macedonia.

agricultural sector is just as high as in the other countries in the Western Balkans, and lags behind the 
overall ECA average. Similarly, data from the enterprise survey 2009 (not reported in the graph) 
show that the share of women employed as full-time non-production workers trails behind the ECA 
average (at 8.4% vs. 12.4%).

Gender aspects of labor market participation have received special attention, as FYR Macedonia is 
the third lowest country in ECA in terms of female labor market participation. In line with 
international evidence, non-participation appears to be linked with education – it is of note, however, 
that among tertiary graduates women are more likely to be active in the labor market than men.  

Other than education, ethnicity is a major factor associated with low participation rates. Recent 
research through focus groups highlighted for example how women from the Albanian community 
living in extended households, independently of their level of education, are expected to have a 
primary obligation in providing care for the elderly or children in the household. Other examples that 
appear to play a role for women in specific ethnic groups include, for example, the pressure to marry 
young and have children soon thereafter reported by women from the Roma community. This has an 
effect on low levels of schooling. Traditional values in the Muslim communities (Albanian, Turkish, 
Roma) also appeared to play an important role in limiting women’s agency outside the home. The 
study also found interesting ethnic differences on decision making in the households about 
employment choices, with women in the Albanian community reporting that their husbands, fathers 
or family elders would take those decisions for them, which is not the case with ethnic Macedonian 
women. Women from all ethnic groups saw employment – and particularly employment in the state 
sector which is socially more acceptable for women in traditional communities – as linked with 
education. 

According to the 2009 Enterprise survey the percentage of firms with female ownership is 
comparable to the ECA average at 36 percent, as is the percentage of firms with female top managers 
(19 percent).

ANNEX 5: CLIMATE CHANGE IN FYR MACEDONIA 

FYR Macedonia faces both current and future challenges stemming from Climate Change and should 
develop both Mitigation and “Adaptation” strategies to help strengthen the longer-term robustness of 
the economy, promote modernization and integration with European standards, and preserve natural 
resource dependent livelihoods.  According to the 2009 Europe and Central Asia World Bank 
flagship report “Managing Uncertainty: Adapting to Climate Change in Europe and Central Asia” – 
FYR Macedonia is ranked twelfth among ECA countries in terms of the overall Vulnerability to 
Climate Change using an index that takes into account exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. 
FYR Macedonia’s exposure to climate change ranks highest among these three factors or fifth in the 
ECA region indicating the strength of future climate change relative to today’s natural variability is 
projected to be high.18 19 

ECA Countries with the greatest vulnerability and exposure to climate change in the 21st 
century: FYR Macedonia ranked twelfth on vulnerability and fifth on exposure 

18 Notes: The index combines the number of additional hot, dry and wet years; hot, dry and wet summers; and hot, dry and wet 
winters projected over the 2070–2100 period relative to the 1961–1990 period. As such, countries already experiencing substantial 
variability and extremes are less likely to rank highly on this index (e.g., India and the Czech Republic have about the same score). 

67 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
 
Climate change adaptation is a cross-cutting theme where each potentially impacted sector must 
assess some mitigation or adaptation options such as: 

- Efficiency gains can be made in the energy sector through technological improvements, 
greening and diversifying the energy mix and reducing the relative vulnerability of hydro 
facilities; 
- There is also a need for more demand side management and efficient water use in irrigation; 
- Since water is a central input, there is a need for greater integrated water resources 
management across the multiple uses of energy, agriculture, water supply and sanitation, and 
cross-border concerns along with environmental and social concerns;  
In agriculture potential adaptation options include drought resistant crops, cropping patterns 
or soil conservation techniques (via extension and piloting); 
- Transport sector investments may need to inventory the most vulnerable assets and upgrade 
engineering design standards for future investments to better withstand impacts of more 
intense rainfall. 

- 

The World Bank has undertaken analytic work on Climate Change Adaptation related to the 
Agriculture and Water Sectors in the previous CAS period, and will continue to support ongoing 
diagnostic work in these sectors in the new CPS period. The heat and power sectors dominate as the 
most intensive generators of greenhouse gases in FYR Macedonia, more intensive than Europe as a 
whole. The World Bank has supported reforms, investments, and analytic work in the energy sector 
to help with Energy Efficiency and plans to expand this support into the next CPS period.  The 
carbon intensity of the existing economy is also relatively high globally as measured by indicators in 
the following tables and graphs:

Institute, 2010). 

FYR Macedonia trends in the relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth indicate a 
dynamic and inverse relationship over time, providing a relatively optimistic view that low carbon 
growth is not only possible but is already happening to a certain extent. Key drivers of improvements 
over time appear to be in the electricity/heat and transport sectors where emissions were historically 
highest and where further opportunities for reductions exist.   The World Bank plans a significant 
effort in the new CPS period to extend and deepen the analysis of linkages and relationships between 
carbon emissions and growth to help prioritize sector recommendations which support the longer 
term environmental sustainability and robustness of FYR Macedonia’s growth path.     

20 GDP-PPP is gross domestic product converted into international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international 
dollar has the same purchasing power in the domestic currency as a U.S. dollar has in the United States. The measure is in a 
constant currency (i.e., adjusted for inflation) using 2005 and 2000 as the base year, respectively.
