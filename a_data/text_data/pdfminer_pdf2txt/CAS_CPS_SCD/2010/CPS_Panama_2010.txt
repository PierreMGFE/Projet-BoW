PANAMA - COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY11-14(CPS)

INTRODUCTION

I.
1.
The Martinelli administration took office in July 2009 with a strong mandate for 
change.  President Ricardo Martinelli was sworn-in for a five-year term on July 1, 2009, backed 
by an unprecedented 60 percent election victory and a majority in the National Assembly (42 of 
71 seats).  The new administration is the fifth democratically elected administration in Panama 
since the ouster of Manuel Noriega in 1989.  The Martinelli administration hopes to build on the 
strengths and lessons of prior governments by combining administrative experience from both 
the private and public sectors to enhance the country’s development prospects.   

2.
The Government has committed to addressing key development challenges 
including bottlenecks to growth as well as expanding economic opportunities for the poor.
Martinelli’s administration is looking toward leveraging private sector economic development 
with public investment to assist with some of the country’s most difficult challenges.  Compared 
to the prior 5 years, the Government is planning to more than double public investment (to over 
US$13 billion), a third of which will be invested in projects to improve Panama’s competitive 
advantages (logistics, tourism, and agriculture).  Moreover, it has committed to deepening the 
impact of the country’s flagship poverty reduction conditional cash transfer program, Red de 
Oportunidades, improve the efficiency and effectiveness of all public spending, and is hoping to 
make significant inroads to improving security, public transportation, educational opportunities, 
health care, and water and sanitation.  To ensure fiscal sustainability and improve equity, the 
Government has begun implementation of a broad-based tax reform that is expected to net an 
additional 2 percent of GDP per year.

3.
In its first six months, the Government has delivered on several of its key goals. 
These goals have been referred to as the metas imperdonables “goals to be met with no excuses.” 
Advances have included: (i) presentation of its 5-year economic development and tax reform 
strategy to the National Assembly, (ii) implementation of its tax reform strategy, (iii) increasing 
police salaries and the minimum wage; (iv) implementing a program to deliver US$100 per 
month for citizens 70 years or older with no pension, called “100 a los 70”; (v) creating the 
Metro Secretariat and a plan for a 14 km Panama City metropolitan subway system; and (vi) 
achieving an investment grade sovereign credit rating from the three main international rating 
agencies.  The Government is also making significant progress on negotiating 16 bilateral tax 
information sharing agreements (more than the required 12) and expects to meet OECD 
requirements by the end of 2010.  Recognizing the challenges of implementing its ambitious 
program, the Government is also working to improve its governance and transparency through 
results based budgeting, enhanced financial management, and procurement reforms.  

4.
Unlike many other governments in the region that face a much more divided 
legislature and fractured polity, the Martinelli administration has been able to quickly pass 
reforms.  While this has permitted the implementation of an ambitious development program 
and allowed for significant policy changes to deliver on campaign commitments, it has also 
generated some concerns about a lack of broad consultation.  In mid-June 2010, the Government 
passed a package of legal reforms as a means to facilitate the implementation of its ambitious 

1

development plan.1  Although the package was presented to promote the speed of public 
investment, it has also raised concerns among some civil society groups about limits to labor 
rights and the potential easing of environmental regulations.  In response, the Martinelli 
administration has committed to opening a broad National Dialogue about the new legislation to 
provide the opportunity to amend it. The challenge for the Government will be to balance its 
commitment to deliver its ambitious development program with the need to develop a broad 
consensus in the country on the legal changes required to meet those commitments in a timely 
manner.          

5.
This Panama CPS (FY2011-14) is built around three pillars aimed to support 
Panama in confronting its development challenges: 1) Economic growth that builds on 
Panama’s competitive advantages, 2) Providing greater opportunities for all, and 3) Transparent 
and efficient public sector that provides returns to society.  The third pillar is cross-cutting and 
helps support growth and provide for a more efficient and effective public sector.  The World 
Bank Group (WBG) support within each of these pillars is focused on areas in which the WBG 
has a strong comparative advantage by virtue of prior successful programs in Panama or relevant 
regional and global experience.  The demand-driven partnership program included in the CPS is 
intended to be flexible and responsive to changing client needs.

II.

COUNTRY CONTEXT



A.

ECONOMY AND GROWTH 

6.
Panama is an upper-middle income country with a dollarized economy and a per 
capita gross national income of US$6,740.   The country has about 3.5 million people; nearly 
three-quarters of them live in urban areas, mostly around the Panama Canal.  About 10 percent of 
the population is of indigenous origin and primarily reside in remote rural areas.   

7.
Panama has an open economy traditionally centered on the Canal, trade and 
financial services. Panama is one of the most open economies in the region, with both exports 
and imports as a share of GDP above 60 percent.  Wholesale and retail trade and financial 
services are concentrated in urban areas and have accounted for 40 percent of GDP and over 80 
percent of the country’s total exports.  Panama’s international service sector rests on five main 
activities including the Panama Canal operations, ports and logistics, tourism, re-exports of the 
Colon Free Zone, and financial intermediation.  Most industry production is agro-industrial and 
has traditionally been concentrated in special economic zones that enjoy privileged tax treatment 
on inputs for export.

8.
Panama’s growth performance has been comparatively strong. Over the last 50 
years, Panama’s real GDP growth has averaged about 5 percent, which has ranked it among the 
faster growing economies in Latin America. With an ethnically diverse population, a world 
famous canal, and a modern financial and trade sector, Panama has been a prime benefactor of 
the increasingly globalized world economy. In the four years prior to the global economic crisis 
in 2008, Panama saw growth averaging 8.5 percent per year and the unemployment rate falling 
from 13.8 percent to 5.6 percent.  Growth was fueled not only by the buoyant global economy, 
but also by strengthened domestic policies that improved fiscal balances, reduced financial sector



vulnerabilities, and enhanced productive investment.  In addition, through a historic national 
referendum in 2006, Panama approved a US$5.25 billion expansion of its canal (See Box 1).  
These factors contributed to strengthened investor confidence, lower interest rates, and greater 
stability, which allowed the economy to weather the global crisis better than most countries. 

Box 1: Panama Canal 

Under Panamanian management, both operational and financial performance of the Canal 
significantly improved. On December 31, 1999, the control of the Canal was transferred to Panama and 
since then the Canal has been managed and operated by the Panama Canal Authority (“ACP”) an 
autonomous entity of the national Government. Over 14,700 vessels passed through the Canal every 
year, carrying over 300 million tons or 5 percent or the world seaborne cargo trade. The main users of 
the Canal are US, China, EU, and Japan, but it is also important to Central and South American 
economies. 
The Canal is the greatest economic asset of the Panamanian nation. ACP’s transfers to the National 
Treasury in 2009 represented about 3.4 percent of country’s GDP and about 12.5 percent of its fiscal 
revenues.
The capacity of the original Canal, with all improvements, is currently close to its maximum. To 
address the capacity challenge the ACP has developed a US$5.25 billion expansion program that by its 
completion in 2014 would double the Canal capacity and enable the use of much larger and more 
efficient vessels.  
Preliminary estimates suggest a permanent 0.6 to 0.8 percentage-point boost to real GDP growth 
after expansion. The improvements would also stimulate international trade and reduce global 
transportation costs.
The IFC Board approved a US$300 million loan for the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) in late 
2008 as part of the US$5.25 billion financing package for the canal’s expansion. IFC’s participation 
ensured the successful structuring of this complex transaction.  At the moment, the expansion project is 
continuing on schedule.

POVERTY

B.
A key development challenge facing Panama is to ensure that economic growth is 
9.
maintained and that benefits are broadly shared.  Indeed, Panama’s economic development 
has been characterized by a high degree of inequality. Growth has traditionally benefited mainly 
the capital-intensive service sectors concentrated geographically in the Panama and Colon 
provinces, while generating little economic opportunity for low-income members of society.2
Moreover, while Panama does spend a relatively large share of GDP on social programs 
compared to other countries in the region, the effectiveness of these programs in reducing 
poverty by creating opportunities for all remains a challenge.     

10.
A large share of the population continues to live in poverty, including about 15 
percent in extreme poverty (See Table 1).  Poverty in the country is concentrated in rural and 
indigenous areas.  Nearly all people living in indigenous areas are poor (96.3 percent) and most 



2 There are likely many elements behind growth not translating into poverty reduction in the poor and rural areas, 
including the lack of education and physical capital, the tradition of communal property, and other cultural and 
economic factors.    

3



are extremely poor (85 percent).  Indigenous areas have close to 21 percent of the total poor 
population and close to 42 percent of the extreme poor.  In non-indigenous rural areas, half of the 
population is poor.  The country has thus one of the highest indexes of inequality in the region 
and the world (0.47 Gini coefficient), with the richest 20 percent of the population responsible 
for half of the country’s total consumption.

11. While social outcomes and access to services have improved, there is a need for 
greater efficiency and effectiveness in public investment to create greater opportunities for 
all.   Life expectancy has increased significantly over the years; however, malnutrition remains a 
major challenge, particularly in indigenous areas where 62 percent of children under five are 
chronically malnourished; in contrast to 11 percent in urban areas.  Malnutrition rates in 
indigenous areas have increased since 2003, when 57 percent of children were chronically 
malnourished.  Average years of schooling among adults have increased significantly; yet, there 
are major socioeconomic and ethnic differences in school enrollment, especially in secondary 
education.  For example, while in the urban province of Colón secondary net enrollment rate was 
70 percent in 2007, in the Ngäbe Buglé and Kuna Yala indigenous areas it was only about 30 
percent.3  In terms of the quality of basic education, there are also significant challenges to 
overcome.  In a recent regional student learning assessment (SERCE), Panamanian primary 
school students in third and sixth grade scored well below the average among the 16 
participating countries, ahead only of Dominican Republic and Guatemala.4   Access to water 
and sanitation services has improved (the Government estimates that 84 percent of the total 
population has access to potable water through connections) but it is much less in rural areas.5

12.
To address these challenges, Panama has introduced various programs to reduce 
poverty and increase access to services.  The Red de Oportunidades conditional cash transfer 
program, for instance, targets the poorest households with children to improve standards of 
living and access to basic social services.  This program transfers resources to the poorest 
mothers so that their children can go to school and receive basic health and nutrition services.  
This program benefits mainly people living in indigenous and poor rural areas.  The Government 
has also strengthened programs that offer health and education services to the poor in rural areas.

13.
The Martinelli administration is committed to deepening the impact of these 
programs and generating opportunities for all.  The administration has expressed support to 
these social programs as well as providing the public investment needed for greater employment 
and human development opportunities outside the traditional urban areas.  The administration 
has also committed additional resources to social protection programs, such as “100 a los 70” 
that provides US$100 for retirees 70 years or older not covered by pension programs.    
C.

GENDER

14.
Panama is making steady progress on gender equality as measured by education, 
health, and labor force participation indicators disaggregated by sex.6 Progress toward 
gender equality from a legal and institutional standpoint has also been significant. In terms of 
human capital accumulation, women have surpassed men in both secondary and tertiary 
education achievements. This trend is common in Central America (with the exception of 
Guatemala and El Salvador), but it is especially strong in Panama.  Younger generations of 
women are now more likely than their male counterparts to complete secondary school.   

15. While women’s wages still fall behind men’s in Panama, the overall wage gap has 
narrowed for younger generations. Women still earn between fifty to sixty percent of men’s 
wages, which is below Latin America’s average of 67 percent in 1994.  This gap is a result not 
solely of differences in gender endowments (including education), but of also how these 
endowments are rewarded, a pattern which has in part crowded women out of the formal sector 
(See Annex E1).  The Martinelli administration has expressed its concern and commitment for 
narrowing these gaps by enhancing formal sector job market training for underserved segments 
of the population.  The National Institute of Women (Instituto Nacional de la Mujer, INAMU), 
which was created and approved by Law 71 on December 23, 2008 is an autonomous entity that 
supports gender equity.  The Martinelli administration is providing ongoing support to the 
Institute through the First Lady’s Office and the Ministry of Social Development.  The World 
Bank Group partnership with Panama aims also at decreasing these gender gaps.  Two Bank 
financed projects support maternal and reproductive health services; another project supports the 
CCT program which transfer resources to mothers to improve their families’ living standards.  
Finally, the Bank will also provide technical assistance to enhance the formal sector job market 
training for underserved segments of the population. 

D.

GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY

16.
President Ricardo Martinelli won the election on a campaign focused on change and 
better governance and transparency. Prior to elections in 2009, “inefficient government 
bureaucracy” and “corruption” were the top two cited “problematic factors” for doing business in 
Panama.7 To improve the situation, the Government Strategic Plan includes a cross-cutting axis 
aiming precisely at improving the efficiency of the public sector as well as governance and 
transparency. 

17.
The Government of Panama has demonstrated its willingness and commitment to 
improve transparency and governance by supporting a stronger legal framework.  The 
approval of the Fiscal Responsibility Law (Law no. 22, 2008), coupled with improvements made 
to the Procurement Law (Law no. 22, 2006), and the Law of Access to Information and Habeas

Data (Law no. 16, 2002), which encompasses information held by the state that is specific to an 
individual citizen, provide a sound legal framework for future governance and transparency 
work, and help improve public perception and trust in the Government.   

18.
Efforts led by the Dirección General de Contrataciones Públicas (DGCP) have also 
led to improving transparency and governance.  For instance, the DGCP, with World Bank 
support, created PanamaCompra, an e-procurement platform that reduces payment times to 
suppliers of goods and services, and PanamaTramita and PanamaEmprende that simplify 
business processes.  The Government of Panama has strengthened the public procurement 
system not only by increasing its transparency through the use of PanamaCompra but also by 
significantly increasing its efficiency through the introduction of framework agreements for 
commonly used goods.

19.
Although much progress has been made to improve budgetary management in 
recent years, gaps remain and the administration is working to increase effectiveness in 
budget preparation and efficiency in budget execution. Panama’s financial management and 
budgetary systems are fairly comprehensive and transparent, and the medium term budget 
formulation reflects the country’s main priorities. Budget monitoring and execution is timely and 
transparent and extensive financial performance information is made public. However, the 
Government recognizes the need to strengthen a number of key initiatives that include: (i) 
development of a “bottom-up” budgeting process incorporating sector strategic business plans; 
and (ii) compliance with public investment programming procedures during budget preparation. 
With respect to budget execution, the Government would like to strengthen its capacity to 
properly follow procurement plans and control within-year budget modifications to assure 
predictability of expenditures.

20.
The country’s public financial management and public procurement systems are 
adequate for ongoing and expected future operations.  The Bank prepared a CFAA/CPAR in 
December 2006 to document the current state of public financial management in the country, 
including recommendations to enhance the public expenditure efficiency and strengthen the 
impact of the public expenditure. The Government advanced on some of these recommendations. 
While challenges remain, the Government is moving ahead to further strengthen its public 
fiduciary control framework. Public financial management processes have been supported by the 
Bank through previous development policy lending operations as well as an ongoing technical 
assistance operation.  The Bank is also engaged in policy dialogue with the Government to 
follow up on priorities identified in the CFAA/CPAR.

21.
To build on progress made, the Government is working to further strengthen 
accountability and utilize performance metrics.  The allocation of public resources and the 
efficiency of public institutions can be improved by linking public spending to outcomes and 
strengthening key functions, such as sector planning and budgeting, as well as the targeting and 
allocation of public resources.  A critical gap that the administration is working to narrow is the 
lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation of programs and projects. The consolidation of a 
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system is recognized as a vital step to achieving

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

23.

22.
Despite the global crisis, Panama has continued to see growth, albeit modest.  
Compared to a regional average output contraction of 2.5 percent in 2009, Panama did relatively 
well with growth of about 2.4 percent in 2009 (See Figure 1).  The direct effects from the global 
crisis were modest and the financial system remained stable.  However, the economy was 
indirectly affected through declines in credit growth, reduced trade financing, and a halt in new 
real estate construction, which, in turn, was felt in sectors such as agriculture, transport, trade and 
construction.  Reflecting the decline in demand, the current account was balanced in 2009, from 
a deficit of 11.6 percent in 2008. Going forward, growth is expected to accelerate to over 6 
percent and the current account deficit is expected to widen to about 8.0 percent of GDP in 2010-
2011 as internal demand picks up and imports associated with the canal expansion  increase. 
During 2010 and beyond, economic activity is expected to accelerate. The 
Panamanian economy is expected to see 4.8 percent growth in 2010 (See Table 2). The thrust of 
the modest acceleration in growth should be based on ongoing high domestic investment rather 
than a return to booming external demand. The key elements stoking the domestic economy are 
likely to come from the ongoing investment in the Panama Canal expansion project (which by 
mid-2010 should begin its more intensive phase. See Box 1) and the implementation of the 
Government’s overall investment plan, including initiation of the project to build the Metro. 
Stronger credit growth and firmer commodity prices should also contribute to a recovery in 
agriculture and industrial output in 2010-11, with efforts to boost infrastructure improving 
construction output. Unemployment is expected to fall in 2010 as construction picks up and 
financing constraints ease. Based on increased investment and a return to ongoing recovery in 
the global economy, annual growth is projected to rise to above 6 percent in 2011-12.
24.
The Government’s investment plan for the 2010-2014 period amounts to US$13.6 
billion, which is significantly higher than during prior administrations.  About US$7.3 
billion will be invested in the social sectors, of which US$2.9 billion will be invested towards 
training and social assistance. Most of the investment will be done in the regions outside Panama 
City (about US$4.2 billion) but the single most important investment project will be the metro 
for the City of Panama (about US$1.8 billion).  Other expected investments outside urban areas 
include irrigation projects, roads to enhance logistical advantages and interconnection with ports, 
and rural electrification.  The investment program represents an increase of about 1 percent of 
GDP in capital expenditures per year. 



25.
Tax reform approved by the National Assembly is expected to increase tax 
collections. The first of the two phases of the tax reform was implemented before the end of 
2009 and included an increase in taxes for casinos and taxes on income of companies operating 
in the Colon Free Trade Zone.  The total increase in tax collection for the Central Government 
for this phase is estimated at 1 percent of GDP per year.  The second phase of the reform was 
approved by the National Assembly on March 15, 2010 and includes higher taxes on 
consumption and lower taxes on personal and corporate income (See Box 2 for more details). 
The Government is expected to collect an additional 1 percent of GDP per year from this most 
recent reform. Both the first and second phases of reform will bring about 2 percent of GDP in 
additional revenues, which will be sufficient to finance the additional capital expenditures 
required by the new investment plan. The tax reform was planned to be neutral in terms of equity 
but the VAT increase may have a very modest impact on the poor. The Bank will work with the 
Government to improve the targeting of social expending in order to compensate for this 
measure.

26.
A combination of a gradual rise in revenue and a containment of current 
expenditure should allow the authorities to expand public investment while keeping public 
debt sustainable in coming years (See Debt Sustainability Analysis in Annex D1).8 The fiscal 
adjustment since 2005 and higher GDP growth resulted in a fall of the consolidated public debt-
to-GDP ratio from 62.2 percent in 2004 to 38.8 percent in 2008. But in 2009 the debt stock 
increased to about 39.4 percent of GDP owing to slower growth and lower revenues. The 
Government expects to maintain the deficit within the bounds of the Fiscal Sustainability Law, 
which implies a deficit of less than 2.0 percent of GDP in 2010 and a stock of the public debt 
stock that rises slightly to around 40 percent of GDP over the next three years and thereafter 
begins to decline, which is fiscally sustainable. In particular, the increase in investment will be 
financed by the additional revenues collected by the new tax reform, while at the same time 
current expenditures are contained.

Box2: Tax Reform 

Key changes to the corporate income tax: 
x Rates would fall from 30 to 27.5 percent in 2010, and to 25 percent in subsequent years. 
x The CAIR (the alternative corporate tax of 1.4 percent of a firm’s turnover) will not be eliminated 
but will be levied on firms with gross incomes above US$1 million per year. 
x Utilities, casinos, banking, insurance, cement and mining will continue to be taxed at 30 percent.  
x The collection of the corporate income tax proceeds will now be made monthly (instead of yearly), 
at 1 percent of gross revenues, and excess payments at the end of the year could be credited 
towards the following year. 
x Telecommunications and airlines will pay taxes on global income. 
x Remittances to non-residents (currently taxed at 15 percent) could be exempted if the foreign 
beneficiaries are registered in Panama. 
x Banks will pay new taxes ranging from ½ percentage point of their net worth, or a minimum of 
US$100,000, to a maximum of US$5 million.  
Main changes to the personal income tax: 
x Maximum marginal tax rates for individuals will fall from 27 to 15 percent. 
x About 17,000 of the lowest-paid workers will be exempt from personal income tax, due to the 
increase in the threshold of compliance from US$6,000 to US$11,000. 
Primary adjustment to indirect taxes: 
x The tax on final sales of goods and services and the tax on CIF imports will rise from 5 to 7 
percent.

27.
The financial sector has shown significant stability.  The banking system’s role in the 
region has expanded in recent years, with nonresidents deposit growth providing the main source 
of expansion for nonresident’s credit.  Panama is an important offshore financial and business 
center, with financial intermediation dominated by the banking sector.  Holding companies of the 
largest Central American financial groups are domiciled in Panama.  During the recent global 
economic crisis, the financial sector showed remarkable stability underpinned by high 
capitalization and liquidity levels.9  The levels of solvency and liquidity of the banking sector 
will allow the financial system to support the economic recovery through a credit expansion, as 
economic prospects continue to improve.  

28.
Enhancements to the financial sector supervision and legal framework have been 
implemented. A new Banking Law reinforcing the legal and supervision framework became 
effective in August 2008.  These measures, supported by the World Bank, strengthen the powers 
to regulate and supervise conglomerates, enhance the process of resolution of troubled 
institutions and provide legal protection to supervisors.  Auditing standards, criteria for the 
valuation of collateral and liquidity regulations were also upgraded.  Looking ahead, a regional 
approach to dealing with potential stress of financial groups needs to be developed and 
consolidated and cross-border supervision needs to be strengthened. Also, it is important to 
develop contingency plans to deal with situations of financial distress. There continues to be 
scope for improvements in non-bank financial supervision and the institutional framework for 



9 The banking sector is considered stable and resilient but there are always external vulnerabilities due to large 
foreign deposits and lending, large shares of foreign banks and the sheer size of banking sector (as percentage of 
GDP).  Capital adequacy ratio remains at comfortable levels at 11.4 percent, while non-performing loans remain low 
at 1.4 percent and are fully provisioned.  A regional crisis simulation exercise is scheduled for 2010 in which the 
Panamanian banking supervisory authorizes will participate.  A regional approach to consolidated supervision would 
help to deal with potential stress of financial groups with cross-border holdings.  

10



insurance and securities which could further the regional financial integration process.  Access to 
finance by SMEs is limited and the demand for rural microfinance services is not being served.  
A planned Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP) will provide valuable input for the authorities in 
designing their financial sector reform program. 

29.
The authorities are moving toward greater tax information sharing with bilateral 
agreements. Panama is seeking to negotiate more than the required 12 bilateral double taxation 
and information exchange treaties by the end of 2010 to be removed from the OECD’s “grey-
list” of tax havens.  Panama has successfully negotiated 8 tax agreements with France, Italy, 
Belgium, the Netherlands, Qatar, Spain, Mexico, and Barbados (the last two have also been 
ratified).  It is also negotiating with South Korea, Ireland, Portugal, Canada, Chile, Luxemburg, 
Czech Republic, and Singapore and has plans to extend to additional countries. 

30.
Since March 2010, Panama achieved investment grade status from Fitch, Standard 
& Poor’s and Moody’s credit rating agencies.  Panama’s credit rating upgrade reflects a 
sustained improvement in public finances, underpinned by recent tax reforms, and the economy's 
resilience to the global financial crisis and associated recession. By achieving investment grade, 
the country hopes to lower the cost of borrowing and increase access to additional financing 
from institutions and investors that are restricted to high-grade investments. 

31.
Panama is actively pursuing greater trade linkages with global markets.   The US-
Panama Trade Preference Agreement (TPA) was signed on June 28, 2007 and ratified by 
Panama's National Assembly a month later, but is still pending approval by the US Congress. 
Apart from commercial issues, it incorporates economic, institutional, intellectual property, labor 
and environmental policies, among others.  Panama also launched negotiations with the EU and 
the other Central American countries (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and 
Nicaragua) in June 2007 for an Association Agreement (including free trade) to build on the EU-
Central America (CA) Political Dialogue and Co-operation Agreement of 2003.  While the active 
participation of Panama in the negotiations is to be subject to a formal decision to join the 
Economic Integration Process in CA (SIECA), Panama has been an observer in the negotiations. 
For Panama to become a SIECA member it will have to undertake constitutional changes that 
can go beyond the actual negotiations of the EU-CA Associate Agreement (EU-CA AA).    

F.

ENVIRONMENT AND DISASTER MITIGATION

32.
Environmental degradation is a challenge in Panama; it increases vulnerability to 
natural disasters and undermines the natural resource base for sustained economic growth.
Although Panama is relatively less vulnerable to hurricanes and other catastrophic events than 
other countries in the region, it is frequently affected by floods; and with climate change the 
frequency of extreme weather events in the region is expected to rise.  Panama faces growing 
degradation of its urban environments and its natural resources, such as forests, soil and water.
The Government is taking steps to mitigate these problems, including large investments in 
improving water quality of Panama Bay and efforts to implement a series of regulatory and 
institutional reforms to strengthen environmental sustainability, but Panama still faces ongoing 
environmental challenges, such as: (i) the deterioration of water quality; (ii) a high incidence of 
waterborne diseases and respiratory illness linked with indoor and outdoor air pollution, 
particularly among the poor; (iii) deforestation and the expansion of the agricultural frontier; (iv) 
the loss of biodiversity on land and in coastal areas; and (v) pressures on natural resources from 
the extractive industries and real estate construction.
11



33.
The Government is planning a series of investments in large-scale infrastructure to 
sustain economic growth, enhance competitiveness, and facilitate the planned expansion of 
the tourism sector and further growth of maritime and other commercial services. These 
mega-projects include construction of new ports, large tourism projects, infrastructure and 
mining projects, oil refineries and hydroelectric power plants, road construction, and expansion 
of the Panama Canal.  Effective environmental management and strong institutional capacity is a 
fundamental component in resolving potential environmental problems that are often associated 
with these types of investments.  Consequently, the development of effective mechanisms is 
critical for setting environmental priorities, adequate environmental information systems, strong 
environmental regulation and enforcement systems, and a legal framework to facilitate 
community participation in the consultative processes and policy coordination across agencies.

34.
The Government of Panama is making important efforts in the Strategic Plan 2010-
2014 (GPSP) toward mainstreaming environmental protection in the sectoral planning 
processes, although recent legal changes may increase uncertainty. The GPSP recognizes 
that current efforts to promote sustainable land use have been incomplete, with poor planning, 
and without effective enforcement of zoning regulations.  It also highlights the need for 
protecting the country’s natural resource base as a fundamental ingredient for maintaining the 
growth performance of key economic sectors, including the operation of the Panama Canal and 
tapping the very high potential of the country’s tourism industry to induce economic growth and 
generate employment.  Nonetheless, recent changes in the country’s legal framework, 
particularly the option to exempt projects with a “social interest” from an environmental impact 
study and instead use best practice guidelines, may have caused uncertainty over the 
Government’s environmental policy stance.  While the Government has committed to 
reevaluating the recent legal changes through a National Dialogue, and amending them if 
needed, it has stated its strong commitment to utilizing global best practices and guidelines in 
addressing and mitigating potential environmental impacts.  Moreover, for all its projects 
financed by the World Bank, the Government has reiterated its commitment to follow all the 
operational and safeguard policies required of the World Bank supported projects. 

35.
In terms of disaster risk management, the Government acknowledges that there is a 
need to strengthen institutions and policies.  Actions to improve disaster risk management 
include: (i) strengthening the National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC)’s institutional 
capacity; (ii) reducing vulnerability in urban areas; (iii) developing the country’s risk assessment 
and monitoring capacity; (iv) developing risk reduction strategies for emergency response and 
diversified risk management instruments; and (v) strengthening environmental institutions. 

36.
Another strategic area high on the Government’s agenda is the response to the 
challenges posed by climate change and tapping into the opportunities that it offers.  The 
GoP recognizes the need to devise an effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategy 
with buy-in from the country’s diverse groups of stakeholders and sectors; a strategy to facilitate 
the adoption of innovative technologies in the energy sector and agriculture, encourage private 
sector investment in clean technology, promote the use of renewable energy, sustainable land use 
and reduced deforestation. On the adaptation side, priority areas are the reduction of 
vulnerability to natural resource and climate shocks and the spread of vector-borne diseases. On 
the mitigation side, key opportunities include facilitating the use of low-carbon technologies with 
cooperation from other countries, such as Brazil or Mexico, that have pioneering experiences in 
this area. The GoP is looking to identify opportunities to tap into global climate change finance, 
12



e.g. the emerging and growing markets for carbon offsets and REDD credits, and the 
opportunities to address other environmental concerns by tapping into instruments such as the 
Climate Investment Fund and other innovative means.  

III.

GOVERNMENT STRATEGIC PLAN 2010-2014

37.
The Government presented its Strategic Plan to the National Assembly in December 
2009. Adhering to the new Social Fiscal Responsibility Law of 2008, the Government provided 
details of its plan for growth and social development within its first six months in office.  This is 
the first time a government has detailed a plan that includes a description of key challenges, 
priority programs, and the fiscal and investment plan to ensure that the strategy is implemented 
and achieves its goals within the resource envelope available to the country.  This plan is 
composed of an economic growth strategy, a social strategy, and a cross-cutting axis of 
improving governance and transparency.  

38.
The first component of the Government Plan, the economic growth strategy, aims to 
develop tourism, logistics, and the agri-business industry.  These sectors are considered to 
have a competitive advantage compared to other sectors and their expansion through additional 
public investment, within the context of careful environmental management, would produce a 
clear economic and social return.  The sectors were also selected as a means to promote 
opportunities in less developed parts of the country, to reduce inequalities, and to generate self 
reinforcing clusters of growth.  This growth strategy mainly supports areas outside the traditional 
growth engines of Panama and Colon province and looks to invest in those areas of the country 
that have a high economic potential that has yet to be realized.  By doing so, the strategy aims to 
reduce the dual structure of the Panamanian economy to ensure that all benefit from economic 
opportunities.

39.
As a means to kick start development in those areas with high growth potential, the 
economic growth strategy establishes an ambitious investment plan to overcome critical 
bottlenecks in infrastructure and institutions (such as poor access to roads, policy and 
regulatory disincentives). To develop logistical advantages, the Government strategy proposes 
building connecting infrastructure and streamlining and modernizing processes.  As a means to 
facilitate the growth of the tourism industry, the Government aims to generate needed 
infrastructure, expand land titling, attract anchor tenants, and launch a marketing campaign based 
on a country brand.  To develop agriculture, the Government strategy aims to build production 
and access roads, expand irrigation, develop cold chain and storage facilities, restructuring 
incentives and assistance policy, and creating an institution to promote exports (PanExport).  As 
a way to maintain the country’s comparative advantage in the financial services industry, the 
strategy aims to improve the policy and regulatory environment to improve transparency and 
manage financial sector risk.10

40.
The second component of the Government Plan, the social strategy, has two parts, 
generation of human capital and social inclusion. This strategy aims at reducing the stark 
inequalities that exist in Panama by investing heavily in human capital so that all Panamanians 
may benefit from economic opportunities.  In addition, the social strategy aims to strengthen the 



10 The World Bank and IMF will assist Panama with these efforts though analytical support under the Financial 
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).   

13



country’s social protection programs to protect vulnerable groups, including additional support to 
elderly retirees without pensions.

41.
The first part of social strategy (generating human capital) aims to improve the 
quality of education by giving equal opportunities to all and strengthening training to 
generate the skills needed in the country’s priority sectors.  This component includes the 
following strategies: (i) making pre-school education universal; (ii) improving access to basic 
education through distribution of scholarships and increasing the supply of middle schools; (iii) 
developing “Effective or Quality Schools”; (iv) transforming and modernizing curricula; and (v) 
monitoring and evaluating these strategies.  Strengthening training is expected to be achieved 
through:  (i) generating coordination mechanisms between INADEH, the training institute, and 
the Ministry of Labor (MITRADEL); (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of both 
agencies to generate a system to effectively identify demand for training and employment; and 
(iii) generating mechanisms to consult and address the demands of the productive sector.
42.
To ensure that economic growth generates opportunities for all, the social strategy 
also has a comprehensive social inclusion program.  This component is composed of seven 
activities aimed at:
(i) eradicating malnutrition; (ii) extending coverage of potable water to 90 
percent of the population; (iii) increasing the coverage and quality of health services with a focus 
on basic health care; (iv) increasing access to suitable housing; (v) generating a safe an efficient 
public transportation system in Panama city through the construction of the first subway line; (vi) 
ensuring public safety; and (vii) strengthening social protection to vulnerable people through 
conditional cash transfers and support to the elderly.
The Government’s strategic plan includes a cross-cutting axis designed to improve 
43.
the governance and transparency of the public sector.  This cross-cutting strategy aims to 
improve the efficiency, distribution, and targeting of social spending; and to strengthen 
institutional capacities to improve planning and management, including strengthening the 
financial management system and continuing the public procurement reform. Government efforts 
to reform the national procurement system will focus on: i) linking procurement and budget 
planning; ii) improving the legal framework for public procurement; iii) strengthening 
monitoring and evaluation systems; and iv) developing the capacity of Government procurement 
officials to handle complex transactions and take advantage of savings strategies such as the use 
of framework contracts. 

44.
To date, the Government has been able to quickly pass reforms to implement its 
program, but this speed may slow to provide more time for broader consultations.   The 
administration’s strong mandate and majority in the National Assembly has permitted the 
implementation of an ambitious development program and allowed for the passage of significant 
policy changes to deliver on campaign commitments, but it has also generated some concerns 
about a lack of broad consultation.  Indeed, legal reforms in mid-June 2010 were passed to 
promote the speed of public investment, but they also raised concerns among some civil society 
groups about limits to labor rights and the potential easing of environmental regulations.11  In 
response, the Martinelli administration has committed to opening a broad National Dialogue 
about the new legislation to provide the opportunity to amend it. The Government is attempting 
to balance its commitment to deliver its ambitious development program with the need to 
develop a broad consensus on important legal changes to meet those program commitments in a 
timely manner.

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP-PANAMA PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

A.

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LAST CPS (FY08-FY10) AND ISN (FY06-07)

45.
After close to half a decade of limited presence, the CPS (FY08-FY10) and ISN 
(FY06-07) represented a successful re-engagement of dialogue between Panama and the 
World Bank and built a solid foundation for future development partnership.  The ISN was 
discussed with the Board for FY06-07 and represented an important first step toward a full 
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).  After the successful implementation of the ISN, the World 
Bank discussed a three-year CPS for FY08-FY10 that covered the remainder of the Torrijos 
administration and the first year of the new Martinelli administration.  The strategy to begin with 
an ISN and to emphasize AAA early-on contributed to a solid design of the CPS and individual 
operations—particularly with respect to development policy lending. The ISN helped the 
alignment of the CPS with Government strategy in areas of high ownership and where the major 
Government initiatives had been launched.12  The following lessons are relevant to the design 
and implementation of next CPS.  

46.
Alignment with the political cycle can improve delivery of a CPS.  Alignment with 
the political cycle facilitates managing shifts in development priorities across governments, 
helping to deepen ownership of projects in the portfolio. This strategy can be even more effective 
if it is complemented with an up-front delivery of new operations so that their implementation 
can take-off early-on, especially given the lags between approval and full implementation. At the 
same time, the continuity of initiatives launched under the program can be enhanced by the 
dissemination of results and continuous dialogue with a broad base of country stakeholders to 
solidify a consensus on development strategy.  

47.
Strategic use of synergies across different components of the program can help 
improve the effectiveness of Bank support, especially when the relative financial 
contribution of the program is small.  The CPS succeeded in strengthening the delivery of 
results by building synergies across various components of the program. For instance, the AAA 
provided solid background for the dialogue and design of operations approved during the CPS 
period. The technical assistance operations (public sector and social assistance) contributed to 
the design and measurement of the main program initiatives (CCT, procurement, etc.). The CCT 
institutional set-up helped improve the targeting of other social assistance programs. The 
effectiveness of the DPL profited from the quality and coverage of the AAA and the designs 
under the technical assistance. The impact of the next CPS will be enhanced by continued 
emphasis on assuring complementary across programs during design and implementation.  

48.
Enhanced supervision improved portfolio performance and lessened the effect of 
weak implementation capacity.  During the CPS period portfolio implementation was affected 
by the re-engagement process (youth of the portfolio, setting up implementation systems, etc.) 
and the political transition.  Intensive supervision helped to identify and address bottlenecks, 
including those related to procurement procedures.  In addition, close dialogue with the MEF 
reduced the number of unexpected budget re-allocations and allowed for changes in project plans 
to minimize adverse development impact.  In most cases, Government staff and consultants 
working directly on the implementation of Bank-financed projects were retained until the end of 



12  The CPS was composed of the following pillars:  (i) reducing poverty and inequality; (ii) promoting economic 
growth; (iii) strengthening public financial management; and (iv) investing in human capital.    

15



2009 and then in several cases replaced.  The two operations, the Rural Productivity project and 
the Water and Sanitation in Low Income Communities project, which underwent the most 
significant changes in the staff involved in project implementation had not yet recovered 
implementation performance by June 2010.   Despite the effects of the transition on 
implementation, the new administration confirmed that the portfolio of Bank –financed projects 
is well aligned with the priorities of the new administration.13  The Bank expects that with 
continued intensive supervision and capacity building support, the portfolio will return to zero 
projects at risk by January 2011 and that the disbursement ratio will rise above 20% in FY11.   
As a means to deepen development results, facilitate implementation, and better gauge impact 
(both intended and unintended), project teams should strengthen dialogue with project 
beneficiaries as well as authorities.

49.
Focus on results design, monitoring and evaluation enhances the development 
dialogue and serves to gauge progress on development outcomes and Bank contribution to 
results. While in some cases the results proposed under the previous CPS centered on 
intermediate indicators, analytical work was available to track impact, such as the LSMS survey 
that allowed assessment of the targeting accuracy of the CCT program. However, this may not 
always be the case; therefore, it is important to assure the quality and comprehensiveness of the 
result framework. As the program with Panama matures, it should be possible to focus CPS 
results on development outcomes rather than on outputs. The results framework should 
incorporate the major strategic concerns of the CPS, which includes consistency between the 
results matrix and the priorities stated in the main text of the CPS document. In addition, it is 
important to assure that the results framework is tractable and that it is traced regularly and used 
in the dialogue with Government.  

50.
In Panama, the World Bank Group can be very effective when it concentrates on 
the delivery of a mix of lending, technical assistance, private sector support and knowledge 
products. The experience in Panama shows that the Bank’s relevance is amplified when the 
delivery of lending operations is supported by knowledge products.  In turn, technical operations 
must continue to strengthen their focus on the development of high quality designs that 
incorporate lessons from experiences in other countries, as has been done in the CCT where 
Panama absorbed lessons from other programs and went on to build one of the best targeted 
programs in the LAC region. In addition, positive experiences in Panama, such as in public 
procurement, enrich the Bank’s knowledge base in assisting other countries. A strong AAA 
program has also helped contribute to the design of Development Policy Lending which has 
proven to be a useful instrument in Panama in support of key Government priorities.

B.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY: FY11-FY14

51.
The objective of the CPS is to support Government and private sector efforts to 
improve Panama’s productive capacity and reduce poverty.  In a context of rapid economic 
growth, Panama’s public infrastructure has lagged behind and is becoming itself a constraint to 
future growth.  While at one time public sector institutions, financial management, and 
procurement systems may have been sufficient to manage a nascent economy, their capacity to 
manage, monitor and evaluate public investment and spending need to be strengthened to better 
support Panama’s new economy.   



13 One exception was the Quality of Education project, which the Government did not find to be well aligned with 
the new education strategy.   

16



52.
Strategic objectives and areas of engagement.  The proposed CPS aims to provide 
Panama with flexible, demand-driven and focused assistance to achieve its development goals.  
The shared strategy between Panama and the World Bank Group includes reducing poverty and 
inequality by expanding opportunities for the poor, particularly the most vulnerable, via 
sustainable and broad-based growth.  The proposed CPS will cover approximately four years 
(i.e., August 2010 to June 2014) to align the program with Panama’s political cycle.   

53.
The proposed CPS takes into account the lessons learned from the prior CPS and 
ISN, and will feature a mix of instruments to best support Panamanian development needs.
The strategic principles embedded in the strategy include a focus on the sustainability of the 
ongoing program. The new administration will continue work on the core development 
initiatives that include: social assistance targeting, modernization of procurement and public 
financial management, simplification of regulation, and improved service delivery.  In addition, 
the proposed non-lending interventions will further enhance sustainability through a strong focus 
on timeliness, dissemination of results and continuous dialogue with country stakeholders to 
achieve greater impact.  In terms of lending, the Bank will deliver fewer, larger operations to 
make room for greater non-lending support in the Bank’s administrative budget, particularly in 
the outer years of the CPS program (See Annex C1). Improvements in the performance of the 
portfolio will need to remain a focus of the Bank’s efforts during the CPS period, as well as a 
renewed effort to monitor results and development outcomes.  The strategic framework also 
takes into account the role of IFC, which will continue its steady increase in support for private 
sector development through investments, loans, and advisory services aligned with the 
Government’s priorities and programs, as well as activities that promote and strengthen regional 
integration.  This support will build on the current and potential synergies with the Bank, as 
appropriate.

C.

KEY PRIORITIES FOR WORLD BANK GROUP SUPPORT 



54.
The CPS will support Panama’s Government Strategic Plan in its two main axis, 
economic growth, greater opportunities for all, and a cross-cutting axis of improving the 
efficiency and transparency of the public sector.  As shown in Table 3 below, the CPS will 
support the Government’s economic growth strategy through the first pillar of economic growth 
that builds on the country’s competitive advantages.  This pillar will support the Government in 
enhancing the environment for investment and productivity.  The second CPS pillar, generating 
opportunities for all, aims at supporting the Government’s social strategy in two areas of 
generating human capital and improving social inclusion.  Through the proposed new operations 
and AAA activities and those in the current ongoing portfolio, the CPS will support Panama in 
ensuring broad-based and equitable growth opportunities.  Finally, the implementation of 
Panama’s Strategic Plan would not be possible without strengthening institutions and public 
procurement and financial management system.  The last pillar of the CPS, aims precisely at 
enhancing public sector transparency and efficiency by supporting the introduction of results-
based budgeting and supporting the financial management, procurement, and tax reforms.

Table 3:  CPS Program Objectives and Select Areas of Action 



55.
Economic growth that supports competitive advantages. Under this objective, the CPS 
program is focused on results in five broad areas: (i) promoting macroeconomic stability by 
matching public investment and spending needs with fiscal resources; (ii) improving access and 
quality of urban and rural roads; (iii) improving higher education, innovation systems, and 
training for competitiveness; (iv) promoting the productive capacity of the country in 
underserved regions; and (v) managing the risk of climate change and natural disasters.  
Expected results include the maintenance of fiscal sustainability consistent with the Social Fiscal 
Sustainability Law, increased productivity of small scale agricultural producers, as well as 
enhanced capacity to manage climate change and responsiveness to natural disasters. 

x Lending:
¾ Programmatic Broad-Based Growth and Efficiency Development Policy Loans.
This series will be an umbrella operation that will support major policy actions 
and technical achievements under the three pillars of the CPS (Growth, 
Opportunities, and Public Sector Transparency and Efficiency). 
¾ Rural Productivity Project and Consolidation of the Atlantic Mesoamerican 
Biological Corridor Project:  This project is currently active.  It aims at (i) 
contributing to increased productivity among organized rural small-scale 
producers and (ii) conserving globally important biodiversity and important 
forest, mountain, coastal and marine ecosystems. 
¾ Road Asset Preservation Project:  This project is currently under preparation and 
aims at improving the condition of secondary roads. 
18



¾ Catastrophic Risk Deferred Draw-Down Operation (CAT-DDO). The CAT-DDO 
would offer Panama a rapid source of funds in the event of a major natural 
disaster, enabling a quick response to address emergency needs. This would be 
accompanied by the implementation of comprehensive disaster and climate 
change mitigation measures. 

x Analytical and Advisory Activities:    
¾ Quick Response/On Demand Analytical Support:  This would provide for two 
short-term reports per year at the discretion of the Government to support this or 
the other CPS pillars.   
¾ Higher Education and Innovation for Global Competition.  This will provide an 
analytical support for improving national systems of innovation, and higher 
education covering the following issues: (i) the implications for Panama’s higher 
education and innovation system resulting from increasing regional integration 
and globalization, and the associated mobility of labor or capital; (ii) 
benchmarking the higher education system in terms of its  contribution to  skill 
development and knowledge adaptation and innovation against comparator 
countries and/or OECD countries; (iii)  assessment of the objectives, role and 
level of public funding, provision and regulation; (iv) analysis of the needs for 
quality assurance and accreditation to increase access through the private sector; 
and (v) assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the innovation system. 
¾ Non-Lending Technical Assistance (TA) to Improve the Regulatory Framework 
and Financing of Technical and Vocational Training Programs.  This would be a 
TA to improve the activities of INADEH and MITRADEL.  This task would 
support:  (i) the design of a financing mechanism for training to ensure long-term 
sustainability. The effort would be to promote partnerships and cost-sharing with 
industry and re-assess the function of the Training Fund; (ii) the strengthening of 
coordination mechanisms between INADEH and MITRADEL; and (iii) the 
design of an information system that monitors training outcomes and evaluates 
impacts on a continuous basis.   

x

IFC’s Activities: 
¾ IFC’s activities in the country focus on supporting further development of 
Panama’s financial markets and infrastructure, and on investments oriented to 
low-income groups.  The Corporation expects to selectively increase its 
investments in sectors where Panama has a competitive advantage, and to support 
the Government’s reform agenda and mid-term strategic plan. Given the growing 
importance of Panama to regional economic integration, the Corporation is 
looking at investment opportunities that increase regional competitiveness, 
efficiency, and connectivity. At the end of FY2010, the Corporation had US$478 
million in total commitments in the country, with US$114 million in investments 
outstanding.
¾ IFC is aiming to increase its engagement outside the financial sector. The
Corporation expects to increase support for non-financial sector projects that 
advance Panama’s competitiveness and regional economic integration. The focus 
of IFC's activity will be on: (i) logistics and infrastructure projects, both private 
and PPPs, building on opportunities offered by Panama’s growth as a regional 
transportation hub, (ii) support the development of export-oriented agribusiness 
and food producers, particularly by addressing cold storage chains and high value-
19



added agricultural products, and (iii) continue to support investments that increase 
the share of alternative energy, renewable sources, and climate change-related 
projects in the region’s energy matrix. This would build on IFC’s recent 
commitment of its first investment to develop two small/medium size hydro 
power projects with a combined 85 MW generating capacity. IFC also aims to 
support corporate clients pursuing either a regional consolidation strategy or are 
expanding their reach to lower-income groups, as in the case of low income 
housing.
¾ Subnational finance represents IFC's largest exposure in Panama, with US$300 
million outstanding at the close of FY 2010, equivalent to 70 percent of the 
committed balance. This commitment consists of a single transaction to support 
the Panama Canal expansion project. IFC has committed a further US$50 million 
to telecom and US$47 million to infrastructure projects.
¾ IFC’s activities in the financial services industry will continue to be focused on 
strengthening Panama's leading position in the region.  In the financial sector, 
IFC's focus is to: (i) support those institutions with a pan-regional presence in 
neighboring Central American and Andean markets; (ii) support financial 
institutions that focus on local SMEs and provide banking services for 
underserved low-income groups; and (iii) support the development of Panama as 
a hub for the region’s insurance and re-insurance industry. Financial services 
represent IFC's second largest exposure in Panama, with US$80 million in 
commitments to financial institutions, or 17 percent of its committed portfolio in 
FY 2010.

56.
Greater Opportunities for all.  The CPS program will contribute to this objective in three 
ways: (i) improve access to and quality of basic health and nutrition services, with a focus on 
reproductive and child services benefiting rural and indigenous populations; (ii) strengthen social 
protection programs; and (iii) improve quality and access to rural and urban water and sanitation 
services.  Primary expected results include, among others, increased access to health services, 
particularly prenatal services for women and vaccinations for children, increased access to water 
and sanitation services for rural and peri-urban areas, and improved effectiveness and targeting 
of social protection programs. 

x Lending:
¾ Strengthening the Network of Basic Health and Nutrition Services. This operation 
would support the Social Strategy of the Government Strategic Plan through 
strengthening the provision of basic reproductive and child health and nutrition 
services.  This operation would finance:  (i) Support for the functioning of 
Innovative Primary Health Care Centers known as MINSA-CAPSI, one of the 
President’s “Imperdonables” projects; (ii) The continued support to MINSA’s 
Health Extension Coverage Strategy in rural areas through a results based 
financing scheme; (iii) The strengthening of MINSA’s institutional capacity to 
exercise its stewardship role in the health sector; and (iv) improvement in 
procurement and delivery of pharmaceuticals.  
¾ Strengthening Panama’s Social Protection System Technical Assistance Loan. 
This operation would support the second axis of the GOP’s Social Strategy, the 
social inclusion axis, by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the social 
protection system.  This operation will support two main activities:  (i) improving 
the efficiency and targeting of social programs; and (ii) providing support to the 
20



Government’s flagship program “100 a los 70”, which is a non-contributory 
pension, offering a subsidy of US$ 100 a month to people above 70 years of age 
who are living under poverty and who do not receive any other transfer.
¾ Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project:  This project is currently 
active.  This operation main objective is to increase access of populations in 
selected underserved rural communities to quality basic health services known to 
improve maternal, reproductive, and child health; and to improve health system 
performance.  This operation benefits rural communities where an important share 
of indigenous peoples lives. 
¾ Social Protection Project - Support to the Red de Oportunidades:  Improves the 
management and operation of the Conditional Cash Transfer Program (Red de 
Oportunidades) to increase demand for education and maternal and child health 
services with a focus on indigenous areas.
¾ Water and Sanitation in Low income communities:  This project is currently 
active.  It aims at increasing access to sustainable water supply and sanitation 
services in participating communities. 
¾ Metro Water and Sanitation Improvement Project: This project was recently 
approved by the board.  Its objective is to increase the quality, coverage and 
efficiency of water supply and sanitation services for lower-income areas in the 
Panama Metropolitan Region. 

x Analytical and Advisory Activities: 
¾ Making Progress on Reducing Poverty and Inequality (Poverty Assessment):
This study would be part analytical and part technical assistance utilizing the 
findings of the recent LSMS, and sectoral knowledge to build a road map for 
implementing structural policies to address hard to reach pockets of poverty, 
particularly in rural and indigenous areas. 
¾ Quick Response/On Demand Analytical Support.

57.
Enhanced Public Sector Transparency and Efficiency. The CPS would contribute to the 
achievement of this objective in four key areas:  (i) enhance transparency and efficiency of 
public spending and reduce red-tape; (ii) create effective monitoring and evaluation of public 
sector programs; (iii) create results-based budgeting processes; (iv) modernize financial 
management and procurement systems; and (v) improve collection and efficiency of property 
taxes.  The key results expected under this pillar include: improved budgeting processes to 
ensure accurate budget execution and evaluation of outcomes and outputs, increased savings in 
public procured goods and services as measured by the reduction in operational costs, and higher 
efficiency in property tax collections.

x Lending:
¾ Enhanced Public Sector Efficiency Technical Assistance Loan.  This loan would 
provide ongoing support to the MEF, Sectoral Ministries, DGCP, Oficina de 
Metas Presidenciales, and CGR to improve transparency, effectiveness, and 
efficiency in the public sector. The loan continues support initiated under the 
Public Policy Reform Loan that recently closed on June 30, 2010 and expands 
into new areas. This operation would 
include support for starting 
the 
implementation of performance-informed budgeting, financial management 
strengthening, targeting of programs, monitoring and evaluation of public sector 
spending, and public procurement reforms.  In addition, the loan would support 
21



reforms to the administration of property taxes and would contain two 
fundamental elements: (i) developing a strategy for property tax administration 
reforms and (ii) providing support for implementation of new cadastre system.  

x Analytical and Advisory Activities:  
¾ Public Sector Expenditure and Institutions Review: Mapping of functions, 
coverage, and efficiency of public sector programs.  Currently, there are 
numerous programs with overlapping mandates.  Besides being costly, this creates 
a lack of coordination and responsibility for public sector outcomes.  This study 
will evaluate optimal organization of the public sector and make recommendation 
for reforms.  It will also identify structural and overarching institutional hurdles 
and bottlenecks that prevent optimal use of public resources and potential options 
for moving forward.
¾ Public Credit Advisory Services (fee for service). This fee for service activity is 
offered by the World Bank Treasury as a means to support the Government’s 
ongoing efforts to build capacity and tools to manage the validation of cost-risk 
tradeoffs and preparation of risk reports.  This activity could also support the 
Government’s plan to strengthen the development of a domestic market for 
Government securities. 
¾ Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Review: The objective 
of this activity is to evaluate the current situation of processes, systems, and 
institutions related to Public Financial Management (PFM) in the country and 
compared them with international best practices.  This review will use the PEFA 
methodology based on objective indicators for PFM performance to be able to 
assess the condition of country PFM systems and develop a practical sequence of 
reforms and capacity-building actions, in a manner that encourages country 
ownership; reduces transaction costs; enhances donor harmonization; allows 
monitoring of progress of country PFM performance over time; better addresses 
developmental and fiduciary concerns; and leads to improved impact of reforms.
¾ Quick Response/On Demand Analytical Support.

WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM OF SUPPORT



58.
The ongoing portfolio is highly relevant to country needs and is consistent with the 
new Government’s four-year (2010 – 2014) Strategic Plan. The IBRD holds a small portfolio 
in Panama, which comprises six lending operations and a GEF grant; totaling US$181.4 million.  
Two operations recently closed in May and June 2010: the Land Administration Project 
(US$47.9 million) and the Public Policy Technical Assistance (US$15.2 million). The portfolio 
includes operations in health, social protection, rural development, and infrastructure (see Table 
4). Portfolio performance slowed slightly after the Progress Report, due in part to delays in 
implementation attributed to the transitory impact of the change in Government. The current 
undisbursed balance is US$156.0 million.  With the exception of the GEF, there are currently no 
trust funds under implementation in the Bank’s portfolio in Panama.

IFC’s investments have climbed steadily every year since 2006 when the 
Corporation made just US$1.1 million in commitments to Panama. IFC’s committed 
portfolio as of June 30, 2010 totaled US$477.91 million over nine clients (Table 5). Consistent 
with IFC’s regional priorities, infrastructure/sub-national finance accounted for 73 percent of the 
portfolio, financial markets for 17 percent, and information and technology for 10 percent.

The list of possible operations is indicative and will continue to feature a mix of DPL 
and investment lending. There is greater certainty with respect to the early years where 
Government priorities are clearer (see Table 6). The CPS proposes a flexible approach to 
programming for the outer years of the CPS, when lending is expected to be at lower levels than 
during the early years.  Overall lending will depend on Government demand and performance in 
the course of the CPS period as well as the IBRD's overall lending capacity and demand by other 
borrowers.  There are some early indications of possible areas of support, and the Progress 
Report will provide an opportunity for adjustments as needed.  It is anticipated that the program 
areas supported will reflect a certain degree of continuity with the areas supported under the 
previous CPS, in line with the lessons learned in the CPS Completion Report.

There will continue to be a strong focus on analytical and advisory services, to be 
agreed in partnership with the Government.  In line with the lessons learned in the 
Completion Report, the Bank will continue to focus on the delivery of a mix of products. A 
strong AAA program will be particularly important to inform future Development Policy 
Lending and support key Government priorities. Analytical and advisory services will also be 
important to lay the foundation for future lending, as well as to support monitoring and 
evaluation efforts for key Government programs. The Government has also expressed an interest 
in just-in-time policy notes and technical assistance to inform policy discussions and enrich the 
quality of the Bank engagement in Panama.  Finally the Bank also stands ready to provide policy 
and technical advice in the growing Global Public Goods agenda, where the Bank has a 
comparative advantage.
E.

RESULTS MONITORING

62.
The Bank will continue to support results-based monitoring, including the 
production of reliable and timely statistical data.  In line with lessons identified in the CPS 
Completion Report, individual operations will be closely monitored and the program will track

the specific milestones and outcomes that the CPS is designed to support over the next four years 
(see the CPS Results Matrix Annex B1). In addition, the Bank will also help to strengthen 
national monitoring systems and support better coordination in collection and use of data by line-
ministries. Strong national statistics systems are an essential building block of development 
accountability.  The Bank will continue to support the Comptroller General and the Ministry of 
Economy and Finance under the new Enhanced Public Sector Efficiency Technical Assistance 
Loan to improve the content of financial, budgetary and fiscal data in line with international best 
practice.  Direct support will be provided to the various line-ministries to strengthen their 
abilities to collect and use data in coordination with Panama’s National Department of Statistics 
and Census through institutional strengthening components in Bank-financed loans. 

F.

COUNTRY SYSTEMS AND DONOR HARMONIZATION

63.
Country Systems.  As part of the fiduciary environment for project implementation, the 
GoP has largely relied on the use of fiduciary agents for project implementation, resulting in 
difficulties in obtaining accurate execution data and limitations on the application of budgetary 
and external control and procurement regulations. The Martinelli administration wants to 
strengthen country systems to progressively move away from fiduciary agents. The Bank has 
aligned with this initiative and is supporting the GoP to examine ways to strengthen capacity at 
sectoral level, reduce transaction and financial cost, and increase sustainability on the Bank 
supported projects. The GoP with World Bank support is currently developing a project 
execution budgetary module for SIAFPA, named SIAFPA Proyecto.  

64.
Donor Harmonization.  The Government has been in close dialogue with main 
multilateral partners, such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Andean 
Development Corporation (CAF), the European Commission (EC), the UN agencies, and the 
World Bank, as well as bilateral agencies like USAID, JICA (Japan), and AECI (Spain) to 
discuss financial and technical support. Several new operations will be implemented jointly 
and/or coordinated closely with IDB and CAF in this new CPS, including the Metro Water and 
Sanitation Improvement Project which will start implementation the first half of FY11.  In 
addition, the IDB and the WB are jointly supporting the Conditional Cash Transfer Program 
(Red de Oportunidades) providing parallel financing using harmonized fiduciary, procurement, 
and monitoring and evaluation systems. 

65.
 As part of the overall initiative to use country systems and the principles set in the 
Paris Declaration and in the Accra Agenda for Action, the Bank aims to pursue further 
harmonization with other donors to reduce transaction costs.  This includes specific 
initiatives to adopt a unique financial reporting with IDB under the leadership of the “Dirección 
de Contabilidad” of MEF.  As the size of the World Bank program in Panama has grown, 
coordination and harmonization has become an important focus, especially with USAID, IDB 
and CAF to ensure complementariness among the programs.  The Directorate of Technical 
Cooperation at the Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for donor coordination.  
Staff from the Directorate of Technical Cooperation regularly engages in work program planning 
with Panama’s various development partners on an individual basis, ensuring that Government’s 
strategic needs are being met.  Donors then coordinate amongst themselves in complementary or 
overlapping program areas.

G.

CONSULTATIONS

66.
The proposed activities supported by this CPS have been widely consulted with 
country stockholders. Since the 2009 presidential election the Panamanian society continues to 
being consulted and shows board support to the policy platform under implementation by the 
current administration.  This CPS is being developed closely with the Government in 
consultation with civil society and will support the Government’s Strategic Plan for the next 
years.  The proposed activities presented in this document were all requested by the Government, 
taking into account the possible resources of the Bank and its competitive advantage.  

67.
The consultation process for the proposed CPS program 
included major 
stakeholders and Government authorities.  Formal consultation meetings were organized the 
week of May 24 in Panama City and included sectoral Government representatives, as well as 
representatives of business, the international donor community, think tanks, universities,
indigenous communities, and civil society organizations (See Annex F1). Some informal 
consultations took place earlier.  These informal consultations included Panamanian authorities 
(MEF and Presidency), different sectoral Government representatives (MINSA, IDAAN, MOP, 
DGCP, Contraloria, MEF, INADEH, MIDES, Metro Secretariat), members of think tanks (e.g. 
INDESA), indigenous groups, and the donor community (CAF, IDB, UNDP, and USAID).

68.
During the formal consultations, participants considered the Bank to be an 
important partner in Panama’s development agenda, thus, some issues and priorities were 
raised for the Bank to consider in the CPS.  These areas included: 1) The importance of 
building a program that is participatory and benefits all Panamanians, including indigenous 
peoples and small farmers.  There is a general concern that the speed of the Government’s 
program is not adequately allowing for sufficient dialogue among various stockholders.   2) The 
need to strengthen human capital.  Participants in various groups highlighted the importance to 
enhance the quality of basic education and capacity building to ensure sustainable growth that 
will benefit all. Some representatives of indigenous groups mentioned among its priorities the 
implementation of bilingual intercultural education for improving educational outcomes. During 
consultations the importance of increasing the competitiveness of Panama’s labor force was 
discussed, in particular the productivity of small scale-producers by promoting and empowering 
them to participate in international markets.  3) Crime and violence was also mentioned as a key 
development challenge for the country.  Participants were concerned about the increasing levels 
of crime and violence, particularly in Panama City and its peri-urban areas, as well as Colon city. 
Stakeholders expressed their interest in learning about crime prevention programs that the Bank 
has supported and it was noted that that the security issue in Panama must be of critical 
importance in the National agenda to ensure the effectiveness of the Government Plan.  

69.
The Bank will continue its consultation process with the Panamanian stakeholders 
on a regular basis, including in the preparation of specific projects, and will incorporate to the 
extent possible recommendations made during the CPS consultations meetings into the design of 
specific projects. 

V.

RISKS TO PANAMA CPS 

70.
Economic: Panama was one of the few countries in the region that experienced 
economic growth in 2009, although it was a significant slowdown from prior years.  To a large 
degree, near-term growth is expected to follow the global economic recovery and surpass many 
26



countries in the region as pre-financed investment spending (particularly in the Canal) 
accelerates.  However, there is a risk that growth may remain lower than expected, particularly if 
external demand does not pick up and tax resources available to the Government are constrained.  
Less than expected tax collections, due to slower than expected growth and/or less than 
anticipated results from tax reforms, could either constrain the Government’s investment 
program and/or put pressure on fiscal balances. This, in turn may slow execution of projects. 
This risk is mitigated by the steps the Government is taking to ensure adequate fiscal resources 
through its already approved tax reform plan as well as steps it its taking to maintain investment 
grade credit rating on its sovereign borrowing.
71.
Institutional: The Government has committed 
to 
implement 
its wide-reaching 
development strategy before its tenure ends in 2014.  The speed of the process may, however, be 
more rapid than the ability of current institutional capacity to cope, and hence, implementation 
bottlenecks may occur as well as the potential for procurement errors and other costs.  These 
risks will be mitigated by strengthened supervision of Bank financed projects, but also through 
technical assistance support the Bank is providing for financial management processes, 
transparency, and procurement processes to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the General 
Accounting Office, and the General Directorate of Public Procurement.  
72.
Political: The rapid speed of implementation and wide-reaching nature of the 
development plan may also lead to political concerns that there is a lack of transparency and 
adequate consultation on development projects. Particularly, historically marginalized groups 
such as the indigenous and poor may be given less voice in the development process if 
implementation is emphasized over consultation and planning. This, in turn, may solidify and 
strengthen political opposition to all projects, regardless of their merit and, hence, slow project 
implementation.  Indeed, recent changes to the labor and environmental codes led to wide-spread 
protests.15  To its merit, the Government has responded by opening a National Dialogue on the 
recent changes to the law in order to seek a broader consensus within the country and make any 
changes if needed.  To mitigate this risk in the context of the CPS strategy, the Bank will work 
jointly with authorities to conduct broad consultations within Bank supported projects.

73.

Environmental and Natural Disaster:  The Government’s ambitious investment plan, 
as well as the proposed operations supporting this plan, could be delayed due to natural disaster 
risks, environmental concerns, and uncertainty about environmental policies.  As in any large 
program of infrastructure development, the scope for unexpected delays due to potential 
environmental and natural disaster challenges is a risk for program implementation.  This is 
particularly the case of Panama with such a large number of projects in the Government’s 
strategy.  In addition, recent changes to environmental policies and norms may also delay the 
implementation of the Government’s strategy as institutions adjust and the potential effects are 
evaluated.16  To reduce this risk, the Bank will be working closely with the client to ensure that 
all environmental evaluations as well as mitigation strategies are timely implemented during the 
early stages of Bank project design.  The Bank will also be supporting Panama’s development of 
a natural disaster risk mitigation strategy.

15  Law 30 allows for “good-practice” guidelines to be used in place of environmental impact assessments if a 
project was deemed in the “social interest” and, in terms of the labor code, makes it illegal for  non-voluntary union 
dues and allowed for temporary workers to replace striking union members, among other changes.   
16 Law 30 also authorizes the adherence to ‘Good Environmental Practices’ in lieu of an Environmental Impact 
Assessment as previously prescribed by Article 23 of Ley 41 of 1998.

Annex D1: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis 

1.
The debt sustainability analysis presented in this annex is based on the macroeconomic 
framework summarize in Table 2 of the main document. The analysis uses both a deterministic 
model and stochastic simulations. The analysis applies two different concepts of public debt: (1) 
Non Financial Public Sector (NFPS) debt, excluding the accounts of the Panama Canal Authority 
(ACP); (2) NFPS debt including debts of the ACP.17 Both definitions define debt on a net basis 
by excluding public debt instruments held by the Fiduciary Fund and the Institute of Social 
Security (CSS) from gross public debt. 

2.
The economy is expected to recover from the global crisis to a growth rate of 6.5 percent 
in 2012 (up from a 2.4 growth rate in 2009). In the baseline scenario, the fiscal deficit of the 
NFPS, excluding the ACP will remain below 1 percent of GDP with the exception of 2010 as 
stipulated in the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law. GDP inflation to remain at 2.5 percent. 
3.
Table D1.1 presents the evolution of the stock of the NFPS debt from 2005 to 2009 
providing a breakdown by credit for the stock of debt. Panama’s public debt is mainly external 
(93 percent of total debt). Domestic debt corresponds to about 7 percent to the total debt.

Panama’s public debt is projected to stay on a sustainable path over the period 
2010-2015.  Table 3 indicates that a zero primary balance, on average, between 2010 and 2015 
would result in a gradual decline in the public debt to GDP ratio from 40.1 percent of GDP by 
the end of 2009 to 35.8 percent by end-2015.

5.
Although the debt outlook under the baseline scenario looks fairly stable, there are 
still some potential economic risks that could arise in the medium term. To examine the 
potential implication of these risks, Table D1.2 present projected debt dynamics for the Non-
Financial Public Sector (excluding. ACP) under most pessimistic alternative scenarios:

17 The Panama Canal Authority is an autonomous agency with fiscal accounts separate from that of the Non-
Financial Public Sector. ACP debt is not explicitly guaranteed by the sovereign.

x Considering tighter financial market conditions reflected in higher real interest rates for 
public debt over 2010-2011- scenario B 1- projected debt indicators for 2011 would be 
1.7 percentage points higher than under the baseline scenario. 
x Under a pessimistic growth scenario (2 percent contraction over 2010-2011) compared to 
the baseline (6.1 percent over 2010-2015)-Scenario B2- the public debt-to-GDP ratio 
would be 5.3 percentage point higher than under the baseline scenario in 2015. 
x Assuming a looser fiscal policy-scenario B3- with an average primary deficit of 0.7 
percent of GDP over 2010-2011 instead of the assumed primary surplus of 2.1 percent of 
GDP under the baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would be 4.1 percentage 
points higher than under the baseline scenario in 2015. 
x Under a scenario of contemporaneous shocks in which GDP growth, the primary balance 
and real interest rates are affected- scenario B 4- the public debt-to-GDP would reach 
32.1 percent in 2015 or 7.3 percentage points higher than in the baseline scenario.

The second part of the analysis incorporates the accounts of the Panama Canal Authority 
and the canal expansion borrowing schedule for the period 2010-2015. The ACP is an 

46

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
autonomous entity which has fiscal accounts separate from the rest of the Panamanian public 
sector. Nonetheless, the ACP has close ties to the public sector, and has contributed to the annual 
revenues of the NFPS by an average of 3.3 percent of GDP during 2005-2009. Due to the 
expansion of the Panama Canal, ACP debt will increase noticeably over the next few years.

7.
The debt sustainability analysis for the NFPS, including the ACP (Table D1.3), indicates 
than an average 1 percent of GDP primary surpluses between 2010-2013 would lead the debt-to-
GDP ratio to gradually decline to 27.8 percent of GDP in 2015. This figure is 3 percentage points 
of GDP higher than the NFPS debt excluding the ACP. The most severe test, which assumes a 
combined shock on the growth rate, interest rate and primary balance, the public debt-to-GDP 
ratio would reach 35.2 percent in 2015. However, it is noteworthy, that the projected debt-to-
GDP ratio declines under all other stress tests.

Stochastic simulations assign a low probability to a sharp increase in the debt ratio.
Stochastic simulations produce confidence intervals for the public debt ratios corresponding to 
varying degrees of uncertainty for four key macroeconomic variables: (a) domestic interest rates, 
(b) the growth rate, (c) the exchange rate, and (d) the foreign interest rate.  Assuming an average 
0.9 percentage point of GDP primary balance including ACP and (2.1 percentage points of GDP 
primary surplus excluding ACP) in the period 2010-2015, there is a 97.5 percent probability that 
the public debt-to-GDP ratio will remain between 18.6 (15.3) and 37.3 (33) percent by end-2015 
(Figure D1.1).

Fiscal Sustainability Framework (FS) 

9.
The level of public debt is said to be sustainable whenever it does not exceed the present 
value of future primary surpluses.  In simple terms, an upward trend in public debt to GNP ratio 
is regarded as a signal of unsustainability.  The deterministic models of FS are based on some 
accounting identities.  The first step of the analysis is to produce a baseline scenario projection 
for public debt-to-GNP ratio based on some specific macroeconomic and fiscal policy forecasts.  
The next step is to conduct stress tests in order to determine the bounds of debt ratio under less 
favorable assumptions.  A declining trend in debt ratio is deemed favorable for sustainability, but 
judgment critically depends on the soundness of the underlying forecasts of the key 
macroeconomic variables.  Although the analysis is practical and the interpretation of its results 
is quite straightforward, the framework has many shortcomings.  The main drawback is the 
ignorance of the interaction among the variables; a shock to a specific variable is assumed to 
have no repercussions on other key variables. This apparently implies that the final impact of a 
shock on the debt ratio could be underestimated. 

10.
A more recent approach to fiscal sustainability is utilizing a stochastic simulation tool.18
This framework takes the interactions among key variables into account, contrary to the 
deterministic approach.  The common practice is to estimate a VAR model in order to obtain the 
correlation matrix of the key macroeconomic variables that are assumed to have an impact on 



18 See for example, Celasun et al. (2007) IMF Staff Papers, Vol. 53, No.3 

48

debt ratio.  The next step is to use these correlations to carry out Monte Carlo simulations with 
an aim to generating large sample of bound tests.  As a result, frequency distributions of the debt 
ratio can be derived for each year of projection, which provides a probabilistic assessment of 
debt sustainability.  The aim of the analysis is not to determine the path of the public debt ratio 
but to produce “fan charts” that display confidence bands for varying degrees of uncertainty 
around a median projection.  More simply, the analysis produces the probability that the 
simulated debt ratio exceeds a certain level.    

11.
The following is a brief discussion of the methodology developed by Bandiera et al 
(2006)19.  The crucial element of the analysis is to determine the interactions among key 
variables that are assumed to have significant impacts on public debt ratio.  These key variables 
are real interest rate on foreign and domestic debt, real GDP growth rate, and the change in real 
exchange rate.  The primary step is to estimate an unrestricted VAR model composed of the 
above key variables:

12.
The next step is to carry out Monte Carlo simulations in order to generate random 
numbers for these four key variables, each of which has a standard normal distribution.  Then, 
shocks are created for these variables with a joint distribution given by the estimated covariance

Annex E1: Gender Issues in Panama 

1.
Panama is making steady progress on gender equality as stated on the third Millennium 
Development Goal and measured by a set of basic education, health, and labor force participation 
indicators disaggregated by sex (Panama PA 2007). Progress towards gender equality from a 
legal and institutional point of view has also been significant.  

2.
In terms of human capital accumulation, women have surpassed men in both secondary 
and tertiary education achievements in the country. As indicated in Figure 1, this trend is 
common in Central America (with the exception of Guatemala and El Salvador), but it is 
especially strong in Panama.  Younger generations of women are now more likely than their 
male counterparts to complete secondary school.

3.
Despite these educational advances, women’s wages still fall behind men’s in Panama. 
As indicated in Figure 2, while the gap has narrowed for younger generations, women still earn 
between fifty to sixty percent of men’s wages in the country.  This is below Latin America’s 
average which in 1994 was 67% of men’s wages.  This gap is a result not of differences in 
gender endowments (including education), but of how these endowments are rewarded, a pattern 
which has in part crowded women out of the formal sector.

In addition to earning less, women are also more vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks in 
Panama. As depicted in Figure 3, women’s employment elasticity with respect to GDP in the 
region has been consistently above men’s. The current economic crisis may have 
disproportionately decreased women’s incomes, especially through employment cuts in export-
oriented industries.  This likely loss of women’s income may have long-term negative 
implications for the welfare of poor households in the region since women are more likely to 
invest a larger proportion of their income on their children.

Annex F1: Consultation with Panamanian Stakeholders 

1.
Indigenous groups, 
think 
tanks, 
religious organizations, 
international 
financial 
institutions, private sector and Government representatives were convened in Panama City to 
participate in the CPS Consultations on May 24 – 26, 2010.

2.
Discussions with the Panamanian stakeholders were based on a Power Point presentation 
the Bank prepared to obtain feedback on the Bank’s proposed programs and possible areas of 
intervention, in support of the Government’s five year Development Plan: Plan Estratégico de 
Gobierno 2010 – 2014. Participants consider the Bank as an important ally for Panama’s 
development agenda, thus, some issues and priorities were raised for the Bank to consider in this 
CPS as summarized below.  

3.
A Government Development Plan for all. Participants expressed during consultations 
their desire of a more inclusive and participatory Social and Economic Development Plan that 
benefits all Panamanians, including indigenous peoples and small farmers. Some stakeholders 
stated that the Government Investment Plan for the next four years is highly focused in mega 
infrastructure projects that will reinforce the dual economy in Panama and will benefit the 
traditional sources of growth around the Canal and the Colon Free Zone. Participants in various 
groups stressed the need for economic development to accompany social development.  

4.
Strengthen Human Capital. Participants in various groups highlighted the importance 
to enhance the quality of basic education and capacity building to ensure sustainable growth that 
will benefit all. Some representatives of indigenous groups mentioned among its priorities the 
implementation of bilingual intercultural education for improving educational outcomes. The 
lack of qualified Panamanian manpower is a bottleneck for growth and a loss of opportunity to 
take significant labor positions in the country that are generally filled by foreign work force or 
foreign-educated Panamanians. 

5.
During consultations it was discussed the importance of increasing the competitiveness of 
Panama’s labor force in particular the productivity of small scale-producers by promoting and 
empowering them to participate in international markets. 

6.
Ensuring access to basic health care services is also an essential vehicle for developing 
human capital. Stakeholders expressed their concern that Panama has not made significant 
progress on health indicators, particularly the indigenous groups in rural areas. 

7.
Crime and Violence. Participants were concerned of the increasing levels of crime and 
violence, particularly in Panama City and its peri-urban areas, as well as Colon city; and 
requested the Bank assistance in crime prevention programs for youth to drift apart from gangs 
and consequently reduce the percentage of drop-outs in middle and high schools. Stakeholders 
expressed their interest in learning about crime prevention programs that the Bank has supported 
in other countries like Honduras and Colombia with the program “Barrio Seguro.”  It was 
discussed in the CPS consultations that the security issue in Panama must be of critical 
importance in the National agenda to ensure the effectiveness of the Government Investment 
Plan.

54

8.
Increasing Transparency and Improve Public Sector Efficiency. Participants stressed 
the importance of increasing accountability in the public sector to enhance transparency and 
efficiency in public financial management and procurement systems, which will allow a better 
delivery of social services. The government representatives acknowledge the Bank assistance on 
public policy reform and the State modernization and encourage the Bank to continue its support 
in reducing bureaucratic red-tape and other regulatory burdens.  Stakeholders agree with the 
Bank assistance through this CPS in effective monitoring and evaluation of public sector 
programs and results-based budgeting process to ensure accurate budget execution and 
evaluation of outcomes and outputs. 

9.
Harmonization and Coordination in Government co-shared programs. Participants 
consider the Plan Estratégico de Gobierno 2010 – 2014 a very ambitious plan and are concerned 
of the coordination and harmonization among Government entities to avoid overlapping 
responsibilities during the preparation, implementation, and supervision stages of co-shared 
projects, like the Metro. Thus, they would like to seek assistance from the Bank to ensure 
synergy in co-shared programs among Government entities. In addition, it was stated that the 
Government should ensure continuity of its “metas imperdonables”, which are goals to be met 
with no excuses reflected in its National Development Plan. 

10. Medium and Long-Term Agenda. Some stakeholders expressed the need to strengthen 
the Strategic Development Plan over a long-term vision based on a country vision agreed during 
the “Acuerdos de la Concertación Nacional”.20

11.
The Bank will continue its consultation process with the Panamanian stakeholders on a 
regular basis, including in the preparation of specific projects, and will incorporate to the extent 
possible recommendations made during the CPS consultations meetings into the design of the 
CPS.

20 This forum for National Dialogue for Development (facilitated by the UNDP) between the Government and a 
wide range of social organizations, including representatives of indigenous peoples, is aimed at agreeing on a long-
term strategy for economic development and poverty eradication.  Central to this strategy is prioritizing the use of 
additional revenue generated by expansion of the Panama Canal following its expected completion in 2014.  See 
Annex 5 for details.

Annex G1: Completion Report 

Country:  Panama 
Date of CPS: September 7, 2007 
Date of Progress Report:  March 16, 2009 
Period Covered by CPS:  FY2008-FY2010 

1.
This Annex presents the Completion Report for Panama’s FY08-FY10 Country 
Partnership Strategy. This CPS, as well as the Interim Strategy Note ISN FY06-FY07 (Report 
No.32887-PA) that preceded it, supported the Torrijos administration in implementing an 
ambitious development strategy. In addition, the ISN and the CPS helped rebuild the presence of 
the World Bank in Panama after a period of over five years of limited involvement. The 
preparation of the Completion Report has benefited from available AAA and project 
documentation, including Implementation Status Reviews (ISRs). The CPS Progress Report 
(Report No.47725-PA), and its review of the program, has been a valuable input, as have been 
the Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) available and the inputs from the sector teams.   

I.

Background and Challenges at the point of Design

2.
The governments that followed the ouster of General Manuel Noriega at the end of 1989 
dismantled a labyrinth of trade barriers and price controls and implemented a broad privatization 
program accompanied by anti-trust and consumer protection regulation. After a slow-down in the 
early 2000s, the Torrijos administration (2004-2009) infused a new dynamism to the reforms that 
enhanced economic performance.  But, Panama with a population of about 3.5 million, a world 
famous canal, a modern financial center and a per capita GDP that ranks it as an upper-middle 
income nation, remained a country of stark contrasts.  Most notable was the very high degree of 
inequality, perpetuated by dramatic educational disparities, differential access to basic services, 
and wide discrepancies in productivity and incomes.  

3.

As the CPS was designed, Panama continued to face the following challenges:  
x Keeping the economy growing at a high rate; 
Incorporating the poor and the excluded; and
Increasing the efficiency and transparency of Government and building a strong 
human capital base.  

x
x

Keeping the economy growing 

4.
Previous to the FY08-FY10 CPS, the Panamanian economy had been growing fast and 
the expectation was that it would continue to grow at a similar pace. From 2004 to 2006 
Panama’s economy grew on average over 7.5 percent per year, driven by a favorable external 
environment and facilitated by internal reforms and macroeconomic discipline. The prospects for 
economic growth were enhanced by the decision, approved by Panamanians through a national 
referendum in October 2006, to create a third set of locks to expand the Panama Canal, with 
investments close to 30 percent of GDP. In addition, in June 2007, Panama and the United States 

56

signed a Free Trade Agreement that would enhance the opportunities for international trade and 
investment by providing a more stable platform.  

5.
The challenge was then to create conditions for economic agents to profit from these 
opportunities, thus generating incomes and employment, particularly for the poor and excluded. 
Besides the need of a healthy macroeconomic environment, the Government strategy and the 
analytical work coincided in identifying several key priorities that included: (a) reducing the 
costs for business to comply with regulatory norms; (b) increasing the supply of skilled and well 
trained personnel; and, (c) encouraging attention to technology development and adoption, 
especially by the small and medium enterprise sector. Given the high levels of poverty in rural 
areas, incomes and productivity in the rural economy were also key concerns.

Incorporating the poor and the excluded

6.
Despite being an upper-middle income country, Panama had been characterized by a high 
degree of inequality. Between 1997 and 2003 (years for which there were living standard 
measurement surveys available) the overall poverty levels, measured by individual consumption, 
had marginally decreased from 37.3 percent to 36.8 percent, while extreme poverty declined 
from 18.8 percent to 16.6 percent.  But although the Gini coefficient for consumption declined 
from 48.5 to 46.9, the coefficient remained above the average for Latin America countries and 
countries with a similar level of per capita income. Moreover, during the same period, the share 
of the extremely poor living in indigenous areas had increased from 35 percent in 1997 to 42 
percent in 2003 and the share of the poor living in urban areas had almost doubled from 9 to 16 
percent. The majority of the poor (57 percent) were less than 20 years old. In addition, poverty 
pressures had increasingly pushed people to exploit the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor’s 
natural resources which are among the most biologically diverse in the world, in unsustainable 
ways.

7.
While the information on poverty incidence was likely to be obsolete by 2007, it 
highlighted the main challenges to reach the poor and to generate opportunities to all.  This 
would require better access to education given that poor adult Panamanians averaged just over 5 
years of schooling in 2003 and indigenous adults averaged a meager 3 years. Similarly, moving 
away from the traditional approach of social assistance, which relied on universal subsidies, 
towards greater targeting of social programs could improve the effectiveness of these programs 
and thus social outcomes.  

Improving the quality and transparency of public expenditure 

8.
The CPS document emphasized that the public sector in Panama did not so much lack 
resources as it lacked re-distributional effectiveness. Panama was spending 17 percent of GDP in 
the social sectors, above other countries in Latin America, but its outcomes were not 
commensurate with that level of expenditure. Social assistance expenditure, around 1 percent of 
GDP, had historically gone to universal subsidies including price subsidies for electricity, 
cooking oil and piped water, services out of reach to the poor. As highlighted in the Panama 
Poverty Assessment (2007), the relatively high levels of poverty in Panama were not due to lack 
of social spending, but rather to inadequate targeting, efficiency and effectiveness of 
Government programs. Likewise, the state could improve its support for economic activity in 

57

areas where it was involved: providing and maintaining infrastructure, educating the population, 
supporting innovation, and regulating efficiently.  The 2007 Panama Country Financial 
Accountability and Procurement Assessment Report (CFAPAR) pointed to the need to 
modernize the public financial management and procurement regimes, taking stock as well as 
proposing a roadmap for reform.   

The Government Program
9.
The Government Program of the Torrijos Administration had been designed for tackling 
these challenges through an ambitious transformational strategy, summarized in Table 1 of the 
Appendix, that stood on four pillars: 
x Pillar I: Reduced Poverty and Inequality; 
x Pillar II: Promote Economic Growth and Employment; 
x Pillar III: Reform Public Finances and Modernize the State; 
x Pillar IV: Develop Human Capital  

10.
Building on the structural reform process that was suspended after 1999, this strategy 
emphasized fiscal discipline, transparency and greater efficiency as crucial elements for ensuring 
a sound economic base, accelerating export-led economic growth, creating more jobs and 
reducing poverty.  The Torrijos administration set an ambitious goal of lowering poverty by one-
fifth during its term in office and prioritized investments in human capital (including a big effort 
to modernize education and training) and targeted social assistance (including the introduction of 
a flagship targeted conditional cash transfer program and the continued expansion of pre-school 
education and primary health care, especially in poor and indigenous areas) as hallmarks of this 
effort. 

The FY08-FY10 CPS Program 
11.
The CPS and the preceding ISN supported selected aspects of the strategic vision of the 
Torrijos administration organized around four broad objectives as summarized in Table 1, copied 
from the CPS document.

12.
The FY06-FY07 ISN rejuvenated the Bank’s agenda in Panama after it dropped off 
dramatically between 2000 and 2004. The ISN’s new analytical work contributed to a robust 
policy dialogue and the project pipeline was rebuilt. The design of the CPS benefited from the 
ISN experience. At the time of CPS approval there were five projects under implementation, 
three of which had been approved during the previous ISN. The CPS design relied on a DPL 
series to support and track delivery of the bulk of the expected results. The investment and TA 
portfolio was to assist the Government in achieving results. Given the youth of the program, the 
CPS was clear that in several areas results would be coming in the follow-up CPS. The results 
matrix noted when this would be the case.  

13.
The CPS included a lending envelop of US$390-US$465 million over FY08-FY10, with 
new financing split mainly between Development Policy Lending and seven new poverty-
focused investment projects. The design of the CPS was assisted by recently completed AAA: 
Country Financial Accountability Assessment/Procurement Assessment Review; Public 
Expenditure Review; Poverty Assessment; and Urban Transport Study.

The CPS was designed for a three year period to coincide with the political cycle.

Sound macroeconomic management together with a positive external environment led 
to strong economic growth. Panama reduced its public debt from a peak of 62.2 percent of GDP 
in 2004 to 38 percent in 2008 as a result of the high economic growth and tight fiscal stance that 
turned from a deficit of about 5 percent of GDP in 2004 into surpluses of 3.5 percent in 2007 and 
0.4 in 2008. The strong fiscal stance was aided by a strong revenue performance that included 
greater transfers from the Panama Canal and advances in tax policy and administration. CPI 
year-on-year inflation peaked at 10 percent in September 2008 driven by food and commodity 
prices as well as strong internal and external demand; however, it had fallen to 4.3 percent year-
to-year in January 2009. In 2008, Standard and Poor upgraded Panama’s long-term foreign and 
local currency issues default ratings from BB to BB+, while Fitch affirmed Panama’s BB+ 
rating, revising the outlook to positive. The average economic growth in 2007 and 2008 was 11.4 
percent.  Recently, on March 23, 2010, Panama achieved an investment grade credit rating from 
Fitch for its sovereign bonds; and a few weeks later from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.   

16.
The global crisis hit Panama hard, but Panama was well prepared to deal with it. 
Panama did relatively well during the crisis with a rate of economic growth of 2.4 in 2009. The 
fiscal balance shifted from surplus (2006-2009) to a deficit of 1 percent in 2009. Total public 
debt increased from 38.8 percent of GDP in 2008 to 40 percent in 2009. Revenues and grants 
dropped to 27.2 of GDP but they are still higher than in 2005 (24.3 percent.) The slowdown was 
felt primarily by those sectors most directly affected by the fall in demand, like agriculture, trade 
and construction. 

17.
Poverty incidence decreased but it remains high for the level of income, especially in 
rural areas and among the indigenous populations. The poverty incidence dropped from 36.8 
percent in 2003 to 32.7 percent in 2008, in line with Government expectations. During the same 
period absolute poverty dropped from 16.6 percent to 14.4 percent. Poverty remains high in rural 
areas (59.7 percent) and especially among the indigenous populations (96.3 percent)—here, the 
goal of the Government program was not met. The poverty gap is particularly high, at (67 
percent) amongst the indigenous populations, and low in urban areas (4.7 percent). Sharing 
growth remains a major challenge in Panama.

18.
Social Sectors outcomes:  It is difficult to report on progress on social indicators given 
the lack of up-to-date information and the relatively short three-year period of the CPS. Taking a 
longer perspective (2000-2007) a varied picture emerges. The latest stocktaking of the MDGs21
notes that Panama is one of the countries likely to reach most of the MDG objectives. It notes 
likewise that the Human Development Index (UNDP) increased from 2001 to 2007 and now 
Panama ranks 62 amongst 177 countries. It also notes that poorest regions have been catching 
up. Life expectancy has increased by 4 years since 2000. Still, progress was uneven and overall 
economic growth has not changed fundamental structural patterns. Exclusion remains strong in 
rural and indigenous areas. For instance, the poorest quintile has marginally increased its share of 
consumption to a still low 4 percent in 2008. Quality of education is a major concern.

III.

Delivery of CPS Results and World Bank Contribution 

19.
This section reports on the impact of the Bank program and is organized along the four 
objectives of the CPS. Each section presents the objectives and discusses the relevance of the 
program and then reports on the results as presented in the Annex 4 to the CPS and the 
discussion of the main text of the CPS. Each section ends with a summary.  

CPS objective 1:  Reducing Poverty and Inequality
20.
The CPS program supported efforts to reduce poverty, especially among rural poor and 
indigenous groups.  The focus of results was in two broad areas: improving the targeting and 
effectiveness of social assistance, and supporting sustainable increases in rural productivity.  
Support for the first area came through Public Policy Reform TA loan and Social Protection 
project.  A Poverty Assessment was to complement work planned under the TA loan, with 
impact to be captured through TA loan indicators.  Rural productivity was to be supported by an 
on-going Land Administration project and recently approved Rural Productivity Project and its 
GEF counterpart, which funds sustainable use of the Atlantic Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.  
A Rural Microfinance project, yet to be designed, was to support sustainability of outcomes in 
the land and rural productivity programs.   

CCT

21.
The Bank supported the update of poverty information and its use to better target 
assistance to the poor. When the program Red de Oportunidades22 was launched, information on 
poverty was available from the 2003 and 1997 LSMS poverty profiles and the resulting poverty 
maps.  Based on this information, the Social Protection Project and the Poverty Assessment of 
2007 contributed to the design of the targeting mechanism of the CCT. In addition, the Social 
Protection Project has supported the Management Information System of the program. The CCT 
supports efforts at reducing the "vicious" cycle of poverty by conditioning payments to the 
demand of services.

22.
The CCT is well targeted. The CCT program targets beneficiaries by combining regional 
targeting and the application of a Proxy-Means Test to estimate the vulnerability and eligibility 
of households, differentiating between urban, rural, and indigenous areas. The evidence shows 
that the CCT subsidy is well targeted.23 In 2008, 83.7 percent of the transfers were going to the 
lowest income quintile of the population. 98.4 percent went to the two lowest quintiles.  The

22 In early 2006, the Government launched the Red de Oportunidades (RdO) with the aim of reducing both demand 
and supply barriers impeding access to basic social services through targeted support for the extreme poor and 
vulnerable households with children in Panama. The program involved five main elements: (a) a conditional cash 
transfer program, (b) supply of basic services linked to co-responsibilities (education, health and legal identification 
of beneficiaries), (c) support to beneficiary families to boost their demand for these services, (d) rural infrastructure 
(public works, housing, agricultural development), and (e) program management, monitoring and evaluation. The 
CCT linked the transfers to the most vulnerable sections of the population to investments in the education and health 
of the children of the beneficiary families

2009.

CCT was the best targeted to the poor social assistance program in the country. The CCT 
program in 2008 spent 0.8% of GDP, which was a relatively small portion of the budget 
allocated to social assistance programs for the poor.  This suggests that there is ample space to 
improve the impact of social assistance by utilizing the CCT framework in other programs or 
through the consolidation of programs. 

23.
During implementation, the CPS program was amended to support the authorities’ 
efforts to contain the impact of the food and fuel crisis and the global economic crisis on the 
poor. The food and global crisis called for additional efforts that further advanced the 
implementation of the CPS program helping achieve results that were foreseen for the follow-up 
CPS, such as increasing the coverage of the CCT. To help mitigate the negative impact of 
external shocks on the poor, in 2008, the Government took important steps by adopting a three-
pronged response to the external economic shocks. First, social programs were strengthened 
through an increase in the size of the conditional cash transfer program and an improvement in 
the targeting of other social programs. Second, the quality and coverage of health and nutrition 
services to the extreme poor were strengthened. Third, the Government committed to 
maintaining levels of social spending during the economic deceleration, despite overall cuts in 
fiscal spending. The Bank’s “Protecting the Poor under Global Uncertainty” DPL (FY09), the 
Social Protection Project and the Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project supported 
these efforts.  

24.
The Government increased the coverage and the real value of the conditional cash 
transfers and extended the use of its data base to target other programs. The Government 
progressively expanded the Red de Oportunidades to cover all regions and indigenous areas and 
today the program covers 367,378 people (11 percent of the population).  This coverage (over 
70,000 families) is higher than the 60,000 poor households with children that the CPS foresaw as 
a target for the next strategy.  Also, the Government raised the monthly transfer amount from B. 
/35 to B. /50 for all beneficiaries, increasing real value of the transfer. The DPL and technical 
assistance under the Social Protection Project helped the Government to improve targeting of 
other social programs by using the household registry and management information system 
developed for the CCT program. The social programs that currently use the CCT targeting 
mechanism to identify beneficiaries include: (a) income generating activities for disabled people; 
(b) agricultural training programs executed by INADEH; and (c) a housing improvement 
program for the poor.    

25. Mechanisms are in place to assure financial resources for social priorities. In 2006, the
Government initiated a national dialogue around priorities for the country and its development 
agenda. Representatives from a broad range of social, political, religious, professional, and social 
organizations participated in this process and endorsed the agreement. The document Acuerdos
de la Concertación Nacional para el Desarrollo of October 2007 summarized the agreements 
that included using partially increased fiscal revenues arising from the Panama Canal expansion 
to finance social programs. Law 20 established a legal basis for the National Council for the 
National Development Dialogue, the Presidential Secretary of Goals and the Social Cabinet. The 
Council and the Secretary are responsible for verifying the implementation and goals of the 
Concertación Nacional, while the Social Cabinet is responsible for the coordination of all social 
agencies in the implementation of the Agreements. This initiative remains under implementation. 

63

Rural Productivity 

26.
Support for rural productivity has proceeded at a slower pace.    Delivery of 
outcomes has come mainly through the Land Administration project that has supported the 
revision of titling procedures through the Law on Massive Land Titling approved in June 2006 
and its implementing regulation. An alternative conflict resolution mechanism is in place and has 
contributed to solve around 500 cases. Half of the country has been photographed. 56.550 
parcels haven surveyed and 12,422 titles have been issued in Chiriqui, Veraguas, and Bocas del 
Toro, 113 percent and 104 percent of the target set under the CPS. Estimation of the time and 
cost it takes to register a parcel of land is in process, but not yet available. In respect of the 
Inspection Panel claim submitted last year, Bank staff has been meeting with both groups of 
Requesters (Naso and Ngäbe).    The Rural Productivity Project and its GEF counterpart had 
faced implementation difficulties and results will come only in the next strategy. The proposed 
rural micro-finance operation was dropped. So was as proposed Access to Land operation. 

Summary of Results and Development Impact:
27.
The Completion Report rates as satisfactory the achievement of results under the 
first CPS objective.  The setting in place of a targeting social assistance system covering around 
11 percent of the population is a major achievement, especially when in 2006 no such targeting 
was in place. Targeting is good as 2008 LSMS survey results show that close to 100 percent of 
CCT beneficiaries are in the lowest two quintiles of the population. Coverage exceeded 
expectations set under the CPS. In addition, the Government, with Bank assistance, is using the 
CCT platform to target delivery of other programs, with a spillover impact on health and 
education outcomes. The new administration is committed to continue perfecting the system, 
increasing the targeting effectiveness and the coverage; thus the sustainability of these efforts 
appears assured.  Further targeting improvements are underway based on the 2008 LSMS survey.   
As noted poverty dropped from 1997 to 2007, but it remains high particularly in rural areas and 
amongst the indigenous population. One of the reasons that explain the slow gains is that 
amongst these rural and the indigenous population the depth of poverty is quite large, which 
means that the efforts must be sustained and strengthened. 

CPS Strategic Objective II: Promoting Economic Growth 
28.
The CPS sought to support broad-based economic growth in three priority areas: a 
more competitive national-level business environment (focusing on regulation – including more 
transparent and streamlined regulatory processes, worker training and innovation support), urban 
transport planning in Panama City including mass transit infrastructure, and sustainable tourism 
outside Panama City which would focus on policy, the business environment and infrastructure 
needs in specific areas.  The first area was to be supported by the DPL series and the on-going 
Public Policy TA loan and the 2008 CEM.  The programmatic DPL series was foreseen as the 
main instrument to deliver outcomes. Urban transport interventions were to be built on 
completed TA. A Sustainable Tourism project was to be guided by the planned Country 
Environmental Analysis and have links to the Rural Microfinance project. The Global crisis 
shifted attention to the financial sector, which the Bank supported through the “Protecting the 
Poor under Global Uncertainty DPL”. 

64

Governance and Regulatory Frameworks 



29.
Focusing on facilitating business was highly relevant to the diversification of 
Panama’s sources of growth in the wake of the country’s FTAs and for taking advantage of 
new investment opportunities associated with the Canal expansion project. It was here that the 
gap was the largest with respect to international best practices in the area of regulation. The 
World Bank’s Doing Business reports indicated that in Panama the levels of regulatory non-
compliance and informality were higher than in the rest of LAC and the OECD and that 
procedures to comply with tax and labor regulations and those needed to enforce contracts were 
burdensome. At the same time, according to WEF and Transparency International the incidence 
of corruption in Panama is similar to that found in the rest of Latin America, which in turn lags 
considerably behind the OECD.  To the contrary, in infrastructure and access to finance 
performance was closer to that of OECD countries than to the average for the Latin America 
Region (LAC). The World Economic Forum (WEF), for example, rated the quality of Panama’s 
infrastructure above the average for LAC. Moreover, domestic credit to the private sector as a 
share of GDP was about three times as high in Panama than in the rest of Latin America. 

30.
The Government launched and the Bank supported a program to facilitate the 
interface between public agencies and private entities.  Leadership for the implementation of 
the program was given to the “Secretariat of the Presidency for Governmental Innovation” 
(SPIG) and received technical support from the Governments of Chile and Korea, as well as 
through the Bank’s Public Policy Reform Technical Assistance project.24  The ambitious 
program was at the core of the Government’s agenda to develop electronic government and has 
produced effective results of the ground, including important by products like facilitating on-line 
transactions between private parties (electronic commerce.)25 The next paragraphs summarize 
some of the main achievements. It is worth noting that implementation has been difficult because 
it has required the coordination of several ministries at different stages of e-readiness. With 
hindsight, implementation of the strategy would have benefited from an “execution roadmap” to 
facilitate coordination, monitoring, control and evaluation of progress being made, particularly 
given the complexity of reforms supported in the area of digitalization.

31.
The internet portal “PanamaTramita” is becoming a digital one-stop shop for over 80 
transactions between Government entities, private sector enterprises, and public in general. In 
May 2006, “PanamaTramita” was launched to allow individuals to process through the internet 
passports, identity cards, Government-issued certificates, and similar activities. After preparing a 
detailed inventory of bureaucratic procedures in all Government institutions, SPIG started 
incorporating 
the option of completing selected procedures on-line. By June 2008, 
“PanamaTramita” already allowed 81 different types of on-line transactions. By April 2009, 90 



24 SPIG consulted with various civil society, private sector and Government organizations represented at the 
National Competitiveness Center and gave priority to those procedures that are more frequently used and for which 
administrative improvements would be expected to have a larger impact on the enterprise sector or the general 
population. 
25Re: introduction of electronic signature through Law # 51 of Firma Digital on July 22, 2008.

65

different transactions have been completely digitalized.26 Additionally, the portal provides 
information on the documentation requirements for other processes that are not yet fully 
digitalized.

32. Most new businesses in Panama only require informing the State that they are starting 
a new operation. Law 5 of January 2007, implemented in July 2007, launched the internet portal 
- “PanamaEmprende” that allows on-line registration of most firms, through the Operation 
Notice, which is now the only step required for starting most commercial, industrial or service 
activity in the country.27 Operation Notice automatically triggers other registrations, such as the 
Taxpayer's Unique Registry (RUC) and the Registry of New Businesses before the relevant 
municipality.  Fees can be paid electronically. According the Ministry of Commerce and 
Industry, the time needed to get a license dropped from 30 days to 20 minutes.28 The public may 
access the system and obtain information on the companies doing business. By enhancing 
transparency, PanamaEmprende, a digital “one-stop window”, reduces irregular payments or 
undue delays in the process and facilitates formalization of economic activity, one of the main 
challenges in the country.

33.
Similar efforts are underway to further facilitate international trade by migrating 
transactions to the internet. SPIG began introducing a digitalized Ventanilla Única with the aim 
to become an on-line tool for all export-import processes. Implementation has been delayed. By 
December 2008, a strategic design for the digitalization of the processes had been completed, but 
the Government decided to extend coverage beyond import-export information. This new portal, 
Panamarket, is being designed. However, digitalization of other international trade transactions 
has been completed: AMP for the registration of cargo ships, and SDMC to control commercial 
goods movements in the Colon Free Trade Zone and facilitate interaction between traders, banks, 
and customs.29

34.
The Government undertook other initiatives to improve the regulatory framework for 
doing business. In the area of contract enforcement, with support from the IDB, UNDP and 
bilateral aid agencies, the GOP is implementing an ambitious program of reform of the justice 
system aimed at increasing its independence, transparency and efficiency. This judicial reform 
program, coupled with other policy actions, aims at increasing public sector transparency and 
efficiency by modernizing the Government’s financial management system.  This reform is 
expected to help reduce the incidence of corruption and create further incentives for regulatory 
compliance. In tax administration, the Government focused on improving filing, audit and 
collection procedures to increase enforcement of tax regulations and facilitate tax compliance. 
(See discussion of taxation under the third pillar). 



26 It should be highlighted that through the PanamaTramita portal and links, the GOP has been able to reduce as of 
August 2008, 241 bureaucratic transactions that were either consolidated or eliminated altogether, with a positive 
impact on time and costs for business and individuals.
27 Exceptions to the rule include regulated activities (i.e. banking, insurance, liquor sales, security services, etc.) that 
need to first go to their regulatory bodies before completing the Operation Notice. 
28 Please note that the 2010 Doing Business quotes 12 days to start a business, an improvement from 18 days in 
2008, but still higher than the government quote. The difference may be due to the fact that certain regulated 
activities have to go to additional procedures.  
29 Panama rates high in trading across borders—10 in the 2010 Doing Business.  

66

Training, skills and technology 

35.
Skills and technology were highly relevant to the continued expansion of the economy 
in a wide range of areas that included tourism, construction, and high tech services, which 
benefit from the transportation and telecommunications infrastructure available in the Canal area. 
Panamanian firms tended to invest less in workers’ training and in innovation than do their 
counterparts from other emerging countries. Likewise, in comparison with the rest of Latin 
America, Panama was investing less in research and development (R&D) activities as a percent 
of GDP, and employing fewer researchers as a share of the population.  These constrains were 
already being felt by the emerging non-traditional exports.

36.
The Government launched an ambitious program to upgrade the skills of the labor 
force in preparation for the expected increase in demand for semi-skilled and skilled labor 
from the canal expansion project and the FTA with the U.S. Decree Law 8 of February 2006 
set a new framework for training under principles that emphasized meeting the needs of the 
private sector and the labor market, cooperation between public and private supply, efficiency, 
social inclusion, transparency and accountability.  The Decree Law gave a leadership role to a 
restructured National Training Institute (“Instituto Nacional de Formación Profesional y 
Capacitación para el Desarrollo Humano’’, INADEH), whose mandate included: (a) the 
evaluation and accreditation of public and private providers; and (b) the certification of workers 
participating in competency-based training. In addition, the Government consolidated all public 
training resources in a new National Fiduciary Training Fund, under INADEH management, and 
increased allocations from about US$8 million in 2005, to US$9l million in 2008. 

37.
Certification of training activities has advanced as planned. To develop a competency-
based training system, INADEH has been collaborating with a bipartite non-governmental 
organization - the Labor Foundation (“Fundación del Trabajo”)- and building upon the 
experience developed by this Foundation through a pilot program financed by IDB. INADEH 
has completed the norms for the issuance of competency standards for a total of 23 certifications 
covering selected occupations from strategic sectors of the economy - among others - tourism, 
construction, and agro-industry.

38.
The overhaul of the training system has exceeded expectations. In October 2006, 
INADEH launched the National Training Plan with a target of training 200,000 workers by the 
end of 2008 in selected priority areas which were determined on the basis of public 
consultations, and include tourism, construction, agriculture, transport and other services. That 
target has been met and exceeded only in 2008 through over 400 training programs. (See Table 2 
in the Appendix.) To assure quality, INADEH has been evaluating training providers under the 
supervision of the National Commission of Quality Assurance which was created by Decree Law 
8.

39.
In December 2005 the GOP issued its National Strategic Plan for the Development of 
Science, Technology and Innovation, which was based on extensive consultations with all 
stakeholders.   The implementation of the Plan was assigned to the National Secretariat for 

67

Science, Technology and Innovation (SENACYT).30 Following on the development of the Plan, 
on 14th December 2007, the Law #56 established the National Research System (Sistema de 
Investigación Nacional), with mechanisms to promote research activities that are incorporated in 
the legislation and are similar to those already implemented in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, 
Mexico and Brazil. The funds to be destined to the new system would be allocated using 
transparent technical evaluation mechanisms similar to those used for selecting the R&D and 
innovation projects financed through matching grants, as defined in the original plan. 

40.
Financing for science and technology has been increased. To enable SENACYT to 
execute its responsibilities, budgetary resources were increased from about US$1 M to US$14 M 
between 2005 and 2007 and US$22 M in 2008 (a 57 percent increase from the previous year). In 
addition, budget execution increased from around 77 percent during the period 2005-2006 to 93 
percent in 2007 and 2008. In addition, the share of the budget allocated to investments has 
increased from 57 percent in 2004-2007 to 85 in 2008. With these resources, SENACYT has 
financed matching grants and specific R&D Innovation activities.

41.
It is too early for an in-depth evaluation of impact. Given that investments in science 
and technology have a long maturation process and since SENACYT’s matching grant and 
scholarship programs were introduced fairly recently, it is too early to assess the impact of these 
programs. However, SENACYT estimates that most, if not all, the projects supported under the 
innovation program will generate technological innovations in the form of new products, new 
services, or significant improvements in existing products or services. Over 60 percent of the 
funds allocated to the financing of R&D projects during the period 2004-09 have been to the bio-
science and agri-business sectors. Additionally – during the same period - there have been 181 
projects related to innovation and the promotion of science and technology financed for an 
amount of US$5.8M. All together, this adds to a total of projects financed for US$14.4M.  Future 
impact evaluations would benefit from a more expeditious production of statistics.

Finance

42.
Panama’s financial sector was relatively well positioned going into the crisis and the 
Government took prompt actions to contain potential problems.  A high degree of compliance 
with Basel core principles signaled a well regulated financial sector, where asset quality was 
good with non-performing loans at 1.4 percent of total loans, provisioned at 130 percent. Still, 
the country amended the 1998 Banking Law to strengthen regulation and supervision on a 
consolidated basis. The revised law gave instruments to deal with the crisis. Enhanced auditing 
authority increased the ability of the authorities to understand and follow the impact of the crisis. 
Strengthening of capital requirements and powers to modify required ratios made it possible to

sector performance remains strong after the crisis.  The Bank supported these initiatives through 
the 2009 “Protecting the Poor” DPL. The financial sector has gone through the crisis unscathed.

Summary of Results and Development Impact

43.
The Completion Report rates as satisfactory the achievement of results under the 
second CPS objective.  Solid results were achieved in several areas. Most notable has been the 
expansion of the training system, which has exceeded expectations. The rapid response of the 
authorities and the Bank to take preventive actions in the financial sector to protect against the 
crisis are likewise noteworthy. Efforts at simplifying regulation through direct internet interface 
between the Government and the population cover over 90 transactions and are facilitating 
company registration, which is now automatic for most new companies.  According to the 2010 
Doing Business Panama ranks 77 in the world (83 in 2009), the best ranked country in Central 
America, but below neighbors like Colombia at 37. Panama does best in starting a business (27) 
and trading across borders (10).  It is too early to judge the effectiveness of the investments in 
research and development. Work that the CPS foresaw in urban transport or sustainable tourism 
has been either postponed or cancelled.

CPS Pillar III: Strengthen Public Financial Management    
44.
The CPS supported the establishment of modern public financial management (PFM) 
systems and institutions. Bank support focused on various interrelated areas that covered (a) 
macroeconomic and fiscal management; (b) providing a solid institutional foundation for fiscal 
policy and fiscal management, including the alignment of budgetary allocation with national 
priorities; (c) modern and competitive procurement practices; and, (d) improved treasury 
effectiveness. The ambitious agenda had the support of the programmatic DPL series that also 
tracked improvements as well as technical assistance from the Public Policy TA loan and the 
Debt Management Technical Assistance program (provided by 
the Bank’s Treasury 
Department). The 2007 CFAPAR provided the technical diagnosis of most of the interventions. 
(Chart 1 in the Appendix reproduces information from the ICR of the DPL series that is relevant 
to assess the progress made in PFM).31

Macroeconomic and Fiscal Management

45.
The Government maintained a stable fiscal framework in line with the Government’s 
debt and fiscal deficit targets. As already noted and confirmed by the IMF Article IV 
surveillance mission,32 Panama maintained a prudent fiscal management before and during the 
crisis and as a result has protected the international credit rating of its debt. Public debt level 
dropped to reach 38 percent of GDP in 2008 surpassing Government’s expectations. The new 
administration has substantially reduced the stock of budget arrears still in place. The

31  The Results Matrix of the CPS proposed to rely on PEFA indicators to track progress for some of the results 
under this objective. Please take note that no formal PEFA reviews have been undertaken in Panama. The 2006 
Country Financial Accountability and Procurement Assessment Report took stock following a PEFA framework.  
The DPL Competitiveness and DPL series tracked progress following a PEFA like methodology and reported on the 
progress. See ICR DPL.  
32 The mission took place in March 2009.  

69

nonfinancial public sector balance remained positive during the last three years, despite a large 
increase in public investment of 7 percent of GDP in 2008, and additional social expenditures in 
the range of 1 percent of GDP to compensate for higher costs of living. This positive 
development was possible due to a favorable external environment, as well as fiscal reforms 
implemented in earlier years, which led to higher revenues. Furthermore, the Government 
managed to contain current spending, mostly through a reduction of the share of wages, social 
security deficits and pensions, but also due to lower overall interest payments. Given this 
positive development, which is also reflected in its EMBI spread (see Chart 1), Panama was one 
of the few Latin American countries that were able to tap the international capital markets in 
2009.33 The project supported reforms played an important role in achieving this overall 
satisfactory outcome.

46.
Bank support had an impact on public debt management, but Panama needs to 
develop its domestic debt market. World Bank technical support helped the Government better 
understand the available data on debt and assess costs and risks associated with individual 
strategies.  As a result, the Government extended the average debt maturities, and was able to 
lower the costs of borrowing. The pro-active reaction of Government to a drying up of the 
international capital markets in the fall of 2008 by seeking additional financing from donors to 
secure and by entering the international debt markets promptly were signs of increased debt-
management capacity. Looking forward, the Government would benefit from continuous 
evaluation of the debt profile, the costs and the risks and the development of the local debt 
market, which is of particular relevance given the size and importance of the banking system in 
the country.

47.
Fiscal Revenues increased due to higher transfers from the canal and higher tax 
revenue mobilization as a result of reforms in tax administration, which were supported 
under the DPL program. Overall public revenues increased from 15.1 percent of GDP in 2005 
to 19.7 percent in 2008. Tax revenues over GDP, in turn, increased from 8.7 in 2005 to 10.6 in 
2008. The administrative reforms included the development by the Dirección General de 
Ingresos (DGI) of monthly audit strategies that single out outliers and potential inconsistencies in 
reporting. Some of the results of these reforms are that growth rates for direct taxes paid by legal 
entities averaged around 60 percent between 2004 and 2008 and the number of legal entities 
filing taxes increased by 14 percent during 2005 and 2007. Additionally and mandated by law, 
all direct taxes now are being submitted electronically, either in the form of disks, or via on-line 
transfers (see Figure G1.1). This requirement has put some additional strain on the taxpayer, in 
particular given the low computer penetration and internet access of the population, but helped 
bring down internal processing times and costs. Further reforms might be warranted in the area 
of tax reimbursements, which continue to be cumbersome, both for the DGI and the taxpayer. 34

33 Early 2009 saw some resumption of external issuances by a few of the higher-rated sovereigns in the region: 
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Peru were all able to tap global capital markets.  Panama successfully 
placed USD 323 million in bonds on the international bond markets in March 2009.
34 Note, however, that the 2010 Doing Business ranks paying taxes low at 173, with the number of hours required 
unchanged. The ICR to the DPL series notes that the Doing Business survey includes a broad range of payment and 
hence may not capture selective simplification well.  

70

Institutional Foundations for fiscal policy and management 

48.
A Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law was enacted in June 2008, with technical 
support from both the IMF and the World Bank. Building on a previous law35 and taking 
account of accumulated experience, the Law sets a framework for fiscal management. First, it 
stipulated that the fiscal deficit should not be higher than 1 percent of GDP36, unless economic 
growth drops below 1 percent, and that the total public debt should stay below 40 percent of 
GDP from 2015 on.37 Second, the law included provisions to enhance the fiscal accounts, and to 
increase fiscal transparency through provisions of periodic compliance reports and increased 
public access to the medium-term fiscal framework. The law became effective in January 2009. 
As noted Panama’s deficit in 2009 was below 1 percent. The Law sets a framework upon which 
to build solid fiscal institutions, such operating medium-term fiscal frameworks and results 
budgeting, thus addressing the weaknesses in place today.

Public Procurement

49.

In 2006, Panama began a significant overhaul of its public procurement system. Law
No. 22 of 2006 launched a major public procurement overhaul. The thrust of the reform 

progress has been the implementation of PanamaCompra—an on-line platform for Government 
purchases with the exception of the Panama Canal Authority (PCA), the Social Security 
Administration and the municipalities. PanamaCompra has covered publication of information 
on Government procurement needs and since its introduction in December 2006, more than 
200,000 contracts for a total amount of around US$2.5 billion were made publicly available 
through PanamaCompra (May 2009).38

50.
Next, Panama introduced performance contracts, with technical assistance from the 
Bank and the support of the DPL series. Suppliers bid for eligibility under the performance 
contract system and, if selected, their bids for the goods covered are available continuously over 
the internet (PanamaCompra) for public agencies to choose. Public agencies can then select 
from the available suppliers. In Panama, 21 annual framework contracts have been negotiated 
since 2007,39 and savings in the range of US$100 million have been reaped so far based on 
information from the authorities, including i.e. a US$5 million savings for fuel purchases. 
Substantial gains have also been made in the time it takes to purchase goods—savings go from 
59 days for small items to 33 days for major purchases.40 A 2008 survey showed that public 
perception of the quality of procurement practices was higher for the national budget than for the 
Canal Authority. 



35 The Law was approved in 2002 but never really implemented in the absence of clear sanction mechanisms and 
deficiencies in accountability. 
36 Excluding the Panama Canal Authority. 
37 This includes debt held by the Social Security Administration, but excludes the Fiduciary Fund – a trust that was 
established in the 90s to invest privatization proceeds. 
38 Based on a recent management report of the GDCP, more than 8,219 public contracts were minor purchases 
whose value did not exceed US$30 thousand, 6,928 direct purchases, 281 bids for best value, 3,293 public tenders 
and 31,677 purchase orders through the Electronic Products and Services Catalog PanamaCompra.
39 Including renegotiated contracts. 
40 Solid information is available on the broad gains under the program as in available upon request.  

71

51.
To streamline processes, in July 2008, the Government of Panama created the 
Dirección General de Contrataciones Públicas (DGCP), which is in charge of modernizing 
and coordinating the procurement process for the public sector.  The DGCP has been tracking 
performance of the new system and its findings confirm gains, especially through performance 
contracts. The DGCP introduced in April/May 2010 PanamaCompra 2 which allows bidding 
online and is likely to generate additional savings and further limit the opportunities for 
corruption. In February 2009, the DGCP published a Strategic Plan for public sector 
procurement, which was developed with World Bank support. The strategy is publicly 
available,41 provides a road map of reforms needed to foster the digitalization of the 
Government’s procurement processes, coordinates the implementation and harmonization in 
various agencies, and also provides monitoring tools to measure actual progress.   

Treasury Effectiveness

52.
Budget execution has 
improved, especially treasury payment effectiveness. 
Supported by the IDB, the Government is introducing a National Integrated Financial 
Management System (SIAFPA). To track processing time for payment verification, the General 
Comptroller’s Office (CGR) introduced a reporting tool, which allows identifying and removing 
bottlenecks in internal processes. As a result, over 97 percent of all payments are now being 
verified within 15 days after reception (with the majority being approved within 2-3 days), 
compared to 67 percent in 2006. Payment times have been reduced from about 175 days in 2004 
to close to 40 in 2008. (See Appendix Chart on Public Sector Performance). 

Summary of Results and Development Impact

53.
The Completion Report rates as satisfactory the achievement of results under the 
third CPS objective.  Substantive achievements have been attained under this objective. First, 
the authorities showed skill in addressing the impact of the crisis and macro and fiscal order was 
kept in place, with the country maintaining the international rating of its debt. The Bank 
contributed to these efforts with additional budget support and technical support. Second, in a 
short period of time (2005 to 2009) the procurement reform in Panama has shown improvements 
in designing state-of-the art tools that enhance efficiency of the supply management systems, 
including purchasing strategies (i.e. framework contracts on fuel).  Savings have been clearly 
established. In April 2010 the country is launching PanamaCompra 2 that will allow bidding 
online. Because of the progress in procurement, the Bank selected Panama as one of three 
countries in Latin America for use of domestic country systems in Bank operations. The Bank 
has been very active in providing technical assistance to the procurement reform. Third, the 
Treasury is more effective in making payments and has reduced the time it takes to make a 
payment to around a fifth of the 2004 value. Lastly, the Fiscal Responsibility Law provides a 
platform for the GoP, under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance to further modernize 
planning and budgeting, 
improve monitoring and evaluation and gradually 
introduce 
performance budgeting. The Bank, jointly with the IMF, provided technical assistance in the 
design of the Fiscal Responsibility Law. The New administration has committed to continue 
working in this direction and thus the achievements under this CPS are likely to be sustainable.

CPS Objective IV: Improve health, nutrition, and education attainment of the poor.

54.
The CPS sought to help improve the health, nutrition, and education attainment of the 
poor in four ways: expanding access to basic health and nutrition services for poor families 
(through the recently approved Social Protection project and through the planned Health project), 
increasing the supply of sustainable clean water and sanitation in low-income communities 
(through the recently approved Water Supply and Sanitation to Low-Income Communities 
project), and various interventions to improve education and access from pre-school through 
secondary school (through the on-going Second Basic Education and the planned new education 
project).

55.
The World Bank contributed to the increase in coverage of pre-school and 
secondary education.  The Second Basic Education Project and its Additional Financing (IBRD 
LN 7032-PA/7483-PA) contributed significantly to improvements in preschool and secondary 
education coverage.   The preschool coverage of the 4-5 year-old children in the entire country 
increased from 31 percent in 2001 to 61 percent in 2007, while the enrollment of these children 
increased from 55,369 to 92,900 in the same period, 38,500 children as a consequence of the 
project. The coverage of secondary also increased as a consequence of this project.  From 2000-
2007, net enrolment increased 58.5 percent to 64.6 percent in secondary school (12-17 years). 
The number of Telebásicas established by the project was 3.8 times larger than the target set at 
appraisal (114 as compared to 30).  As a consequence, the number of primary graduate students 
in rural areas with possibility to continue their lower secondary education (grades 7-9) went from 
0 at the start of the project to 17,211 in 2008. 

56.
An important by-product of the new training and skills policy is that INADEH is now 
complementing the education system to reach social groups and geographic areas that had not 
been served before.  INADEH’s close work with universities is building a fruitful mutually 
beneficial interaction with Private Sector entities and developing recognized certification norms 
for selective occupations in high demand.  INADEH implements its National Plan of Technical
Training to a large extent using Ministry of Education secondary technical education centers that 
it supports through investments (close to 20 million). Some universities acknowledge credit for 
technical courses taken at INADEH sponsored classes. In addition, it is reaching – in an 
exceptional effort – indigenous communities and other less privileged social groups (single 
parents and jobless youth) to include them in its programs and tailoring their courses for the 
benefit of these communities.  

57.
The incoming Government declined continued Bank assistance in education. The Basic 
Education Quality Improvement Project was closed before it started its execution. This project 
was designed to help improve quality of education. This project was deemed highly relevant as a 
2005 evaluation (SINECA) had shown that 50 percent of 3rd and 6th graders score “deficient” in 
all subjects and that the percentage increased to 70 percent in Spanish and 85 percent in 
mathematics among 9th and 12th grades. Reportedly, the current administration will use other 
approaches to remedy these deficiencies.—such as emphasis on magnet schools to improve 
quality.

73

58.
The CPS began to work in health and nutrition areas where indicators in Panama 
have lagged average Latin American performance. The Health Equity and Performance 
Improvement Project that became effective in December 2008 is helping deliver a package of 
basic health care services through mobile teams in rural areas outside the indigenous autonomous 
areas by supporting the Estrategia de Extensión de Cobertura (EEC) program.  The project 
finances capitation payments to the regional health offices for them to organize the mobile teams 
that provide services.  By the end of 2009, most regional health offices were providing services 
through these mobile teams.   In addition, the Social Protection Project is financing mobile teams 
that provide a basic package of health and nutrition services in indigenous areas that do not have 
access to the fixed network of health facilities.  The coverage is estimated at 290,000 people. 

59.
In the context of the DPL and utilizing the technical support of the Health Equity and 
Performance Improvement Project and the Social Protection Project, the Ministry of Health 
expanded the geographical coverage of the health service package delivered in isolated and 
poor areas through a more comprehensive inclusion of previously underserved areas. To do 
so, the targeting mechanism of the Estrategia de Extensión de Cobertura (EEC) program was 
improved to cover communities more than one hour away from a health center that has, at a 
minimum, one doctor and one nurse. In the indigenous areas (Comarcas), the Ministry of Health 
proceeded to identify the eligible communities and to assign a health provider. In 2008, more 
than 400,000 families (including the 290,000 mentioned above) benefitted from the health 
package in rural areas, including the indigenous Comarcas. In addition, the Government included 
a comprehensive nutrition component in its package of basic health services delivered to poor 
and isolated communities, as a part of the National Plan to Combat Child Malnutrition (2008-15) 
produced by Ministry of Health and the National Nutrition Secretariat (SENAPAN).  The plan 
confirms the inclusion of an integrated package of nutritional services in the basic package of 
preventive and promotion health services provided by the Coverage Extension Strategy, 
Estrategia de Extensión de Cobertura (EEC), enhancing the sustainability of the initiative.  

Summary of Results and Development Impact: 

60.
The Completion Report rates as moderately satisfactory the achievement of results 
under the fourth CPS objective.  In education, the Bank contributed to increased enrollment in 
pre-school and secondary education (2000-2007).  Lack of updated information prevents an 
assessment of recent national trends, but it all seems to indicate that the Government set itself far 
too ambitious targets for education.  As noted, significant concerns with the quality of education 
remain. The CPS initial design foresaw initiating support in health and nutrition with expected 
the bulk of results from these interventions (health, social assistance, water) to be achieved 
during the next strategy, but the crisis meant that the Government engaged more forcefully in 
health and nutrition utilizing innovative approaches that the Bank has advised and supported—
the Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project and the Social Protection Project. The 
support in health and nutrition is utilizing the CCT infrastructure to better target interventions. 
The Bank is well-placed to help the authorities strengthen further efforts in health and nutrition. 
Lastly, the continued exclusion of the rural indigenous populations remains a critical concern 
that will continue to require attention, including a critical examination of the current approaches.

74

Overall Results Rating 

61.
The Completion Report rates as satisfactory the achievement of results under the CPS 
objective. The CR is rating three of the objectives as satisfactory and one as moderately 
satisfactory, which justifies the overall rating of satisfactory. This rating is consistent with the 
satisfactory rating proposed by the ICR for the Competitiveness and Public Financial 
Management Development Loan series. Overall, the rating of the CPS is warranted given that the 
CPS contributed to major achievements of the Government program, such as the development 
and putting in place of an extensive and well-targeted social assistance program; the 
simplification of the interface between the Government and the public; the putting in place of 
successful training program; the modernization of the public procurement system; the 
introduction of a Fiscal Responsibility Law; and innovative approaches for addressing 
deficiencies in health and education. Admittedly, in some areas (rural productivity, eco-tourism) 
progress fell below expectations partly because dealing with the potential impact of the crisis 
became a priority and partly because the program was overly ambitious to begin with.  

IV.

Bank Performance  

62.
New resources approved during the period fell below initial targets of US$390-465 
million. The Bank approved US$370 million during this CPS period, of which US$255 million 
were in budget support operations.  The US$35 million education project was canceled. Three 
projects were taken off the pipeline (land access, rural micro finance, and sustainable tourism). 
Urban Transport, Social Protection II and Public Policy Reform TA2 will be delivered as part of 
the next strategy. Six projects are under implementation now.  

63.
The Bank adjusted in the Progress Report the CPS lending program to better support 
Panama’s response to global economic shocks. Specifically, the lending program was adjusted 
to increase the liquidity available to address actual and potential spending needs.  To do so, DPL 
II was increased by US$25 million to US$100 million and it was agreed that a third US$80 
million Development Policy Loan – which had originally been seen as optional – would be 
processed in FY09. The single tranche DPL (Protecting the Poor) provided timely support to the 
Government to protect vulnerable groups in the context of the global economic crisis by 
mitigating the impact of economic shocks on the poor and by reducing the risks of a potential 
banking crisis.

64.
Portfolio performance in FY09-10 declined through the political transition, but this 
effect is expected to be temporary. After growing to eight projects in FY09, the portfolio 
stabilized at five projects and a GEF grant at the close of the CPS period (end FY10).   The 
undisbursed balance grew from US$84.9 million at the beginning of FY08 to US$153.2 at the 
start of FY11.  Over the CPS period, the portfolio performance declined due to temporary effects 
of GOP fiscal constraints that limited activity in FY09 and from the political transition in mid-
2009.  Following elections in May 2009, the new administration took office July 1, 2009.  In 
most cases, Government staff and consultants working directly on the implementation of Bank-
financed projects were retained until the end of 2009 and then in several cases replaced.  The two 
operations, the Rural Productivity project and the Water and Sanitation in Low Income 
Communities project, which underwent the most significant changes in the staff involved in 
75

project implementation had not yet recovered implementation performance by June 2010.   
Despite the effects of the transition on implementation, the new administration has confirmed 
that the portfolio of Bank –financed projects is well aligned with the priorities of the new 
administration.42  The Bank expects that with continued intensive supervision and capacity 
building support, the portfolio will return to zero projects at risk by January 2011 and that the 
disbursement ratio will rise above 20% in FY11.

The Bank worked closely with both administrations to help minimize the impact of the 
transition on the portfolio.  Implementation of the portfolio spanned two administrations.  The 
Bank held a Country Portfolio Performance Review in March 2009 to benchmark progress, 
identify issues and plan for the transition; including making sure operational manuals and project 
files were up-to-date.  During the transition period, the incoming administration agreed to keep 
contracted project staff until the end of the calendar year to support continuity in 
implementation.  A CPPR was held with the new administration in December 2009 with follow-
up “mini” CPPRs in January and March 2010.  Unfortunately, these efforts were insufficient to 
protect the portfolio in the short-term, but have helped in building a partnership with new 
counterparts in both the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the line-ministries which is 
expected to support stronger portfolio performance over time. 

66.
Good Quality AAA was delivered in line with the CPS program. The AAA program was 
small, but effective. The CEM/ICA provided background for the budget support operations and 
enriched the dialogue with Government in the areas that the CEM covered: Investment Climate, 
Adjusting to Free Trade; Education and Training; and, Social Protection.  Its messages, further 
streamlined in the Policy Notes, contributed to the dialogue with the new administration and 
have favorably affected the sustainability of core aspects of the CPS. The Poverty Assessment 
(draft) provides a much needed and valuable update to the trends in poverty incidence, and warns 
of the need for continued vigilance as poverty incidence remains high in rural areas and amongst

42 One exception was the Quality of Education project, which the Government did not find to be well aligned with 
its new education strategy.  

76

 
the indigenous population. The Poverty Assessment based on the 2008 LSMS survey is 
providing a valuable update of the main trends linked to the reduction of exclusion and 
inequality, one of the core challenges in the country.  The Environment Review was completed. 

67.
The results framework highlighted the main areas of engagement, but focused mostly 
on outputs more than on outcomes. Given the youth of the program, it is reasonable that a 
considerable number of results centered on outputs and not on outcomes. But, the focus on 
outcomes is needed to gauge accurately the effectiveness of the overall CPS package. For 
instance, the CPS emphasized inclusion and broad-based growth, but monitoring system does not 
permit a straightforward evaluation of impact, although the indications are of progress in the 
right direction. In addition, some of the proposed results did not serve to fully gauge Bank 
contribution. A specific example: For the first strategic objective, the CPS proposed as a result: 
“Government uses updated poverty maps to update information in the management system used 
to target the Red de Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program”, which does not fully 
capture either the broader scope of the Bank’s engagement or the impact of the efforts. 

68.
The Progress Report outlined accurately the response of the Bank to the crisis and, in 
some cases, adjusted the results framework to more realistic expectations. The Progress Report 
provided a thorough discussion of the milestones under the CPS. It also took stock of the 
progress towards the proposed CPS results, adjusting targets to reflect progress. 

69.
The CPS identified correctly risks in three areas: economic, political and portfolio 
performance. The risks that the CPS identified were relevant but their nature changed during 
implementation. The economic global crisis of 2008 and 2009 proved deeper and longer lasting 
posing significant challenges for Panama given its high level of integration with the global 
economy. Panama was well-positioned to weather the crisis because of the previous efforts at 
fiscal strengthening, good macroeconomic management, a well regulated financial sector and 
improved mechanisms to target assistance to the poor, all areas where the Bank program 
contributed. Upon these solid bases the Government with the assistance of the Development 
partners, the World Bank included, dealt dexterously with the crisis; the economic slow-down is 
far less than in similar countries. The design of the CPS as a three-year program helped manage 
the risk associated with shifts in development priorities across administrations. The project 
cancellations that have taken place are a sign of the shift in priorities and approaches; in 
situations such as these, cancelations are preferable than poor implementation later on. The more 
substantive risk to sustainability of the core initiatives under this CPS has been managed through 
dialogue, aided by the Policy Notes. 

70.
The Completion Report rates Bank performance as satisfactory. Several considerations 
justify the satisfactory rating. First, the Bank successfully reengaged in Panama by developing an 
effective and trusting dialogue that has carried into the new administration. The combined design 
of the ISN and the CPS proved effective. The ISN was prepared rapidly thus providing assistance 
to the Government promptly while working in setting the basis for a long-term engagement.  The 
ISN contributed important background analytical work and fostered a productive dialogue. As a 
result, by the time the CPS came into place the major initiatives that the program supported had 
been launched, enhancing the relevance of the CPS efforts. Second, the Bank support to Panama 
in response to the impact of the global crisis was timely and well targeted. It helped the country 

77

contain the impact: Panama’s economy grew in 2009 contrary the majority of the LAC countries. 
Particularly timely was the support provided by the budget support operation “Protecting the 
Poor under Global Uncertainty” that focused on the financial sector and reducing the impact of 
the crisis on the poor.  Third, the Bank played a productive role as a knowledge institution given 
that it assisted in the institutional design of the main Government initiatives under CPS support 
(CCT, procurement, Fiscal Responsibility, training, etc.). The approach enhanced the view of the 
Bank not only as a financial institution but a provider of knowledge products. Fourth, the Bank 
worked effectively with other development partners, especially the IDB, as in the CCT program. 

Lessons 

71.
The challenge for the CPS is to build on the foundations left in place by the successful 
re-insertion of the World Bank in Panama after close to half a decade of limited presence. The 
strategy to begin with an ISN and to emphasize AAA early-on contributed to a solid design of 
the CPS and individual operations—especially the development policy lending. The ISN helped 
the alignment of the CPS with Government strategy in areas of high ownership and where the 
major initiatives had been launched.  The following lessons are relevant to the design and 
implementation of next CPS.  

72.
Alignment with the political cycle can improve delivery of a CPS. Alignment with the 
political cycle facilitates managing shifts in development priorities across governments, helping 
reduce the number of approved projects with limited ownership. This strategy can be even more 
effective if it is complemented with an up-front delivery of new operations so that their 
implementation can take-off early-on, especially given the lags between approval and full 
implementation. At the same time, the continuity of initiatives launched under the program can 
be enhanced by the dissemination of results and continuous dialogue with a broad base of 
country stakeholders to solidify a consensus on development strategy.  

73.
Strategic use of synergies across different components of the program can help 
improve the effectiveness of Bank support, especially when the relative financial contribution 
of the program is small. The CPS succeeded in strengthening the delivery of results by building 
synergies across various components of the program. For instance, the AAA provided solid 
background for the dialogue and design of operations approved during the CPS period. The 
technical assistance operations (public sector, social assistance, and health) contributed to the 
design and measurement of the main program initiatives (CCT, procurement, etc.). The CCT 
institutional set-up helped improve the targeting of other social assistance programs. The 
effectiveness of the DPL profited from the quality and coverage of the AAA and the designs 
under the technical assistance. The impact of the next CPS will be enhanced by continued 
emphasis on assuring complementary across programs during design and implementation.  

74.
Enhanced supervision improved portfolio performance and lessened the effect of weak 
implementation capacity. During the CPS period portfolio implementation was affected by the
re-engagement process (youth of the portfolio, setting up implementation systems, etc.) and the 
political transition.  Intensive supervision helped to identify and address bottlenecks, including 
those related to procurement procedures.  In addition, close dialogue with the MEF reduced the 
number of unexpected budget re-allocations and allowed for changes in project plans to 

78

minimize adverse development impact.  As a means to deepen development results, facilitate 
implementation, and better gauge impact (both intended and unintended), project teams should 
strengthen dialogue with project beneficiaries as well as authorities.

75.
Focus on results design, monitoring and evaluation enhances the development 
dialogue and serves to gauge progress on development outcomes and Bank contribution to 
results. While in some cases the results proposed under the previous CPS centered on 
intermediate indicators, analytical work was available to track impact, such as the LSMS survey 
that allowed assessment of the targeting accuracy of the CCT program. However, this may not 
always be the case; therefore, it is important to assure the quality and comprehensiveness of the 
result framework. As the program with Panama matures, it should be possible to focus CPS 
results on development outcomes rather than on outputs. The results framework should 
incorporate the major strategic concerns of the CPS, which includes consistency between the 
results matrix and the priorities stated in the main text of the CPS document. In addition, it is 
important to assure that the results framework is tractable and that it is traced regularly and used 
in the dialogue with Government.  

76.
In Panama, the World Bank Group can be very effective when it concentrates on the 
delivery of a mix of lending, technical assistance, and knowledge products. The experience in 
Panama shows that the Bank’s relevance is amplified when the delivery of lending operations is 
supported by knowledge products.  In turn, technical operations must continue to strengthen their 
focus on the development of high quality designs that incorporate lessons from experiences in 
other countries, as has been done in the CCT where Panama absorbed lessons from other 
programs and went on to build one of the best targeted programs in the LAC region. In addition, 
positive experiences in Panama, such as in public procurement, enrich the Bank’s knowledge 
base in assisting other countries. A strong AAA program has also helped contribute to the 
design of Development Policy Lending which has proven to be a useful instrument in Panama in 
support of key government priorities.
