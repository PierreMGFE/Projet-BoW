1. 

The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Kingdom of Lesotho for 
FY20 10-1 4 is developed within the context of the Government’s strategy for growth and 
sustainable development as expressed in the 2002 “Vision 2020” and its Interim National 
Development Framework. The latter focuses on four strategic objectives: (i) accelerate 
shared and sustainable economic growth, ensure employment creation and protect the 
vulnerable; (ii) address the HIV/AIDS epidemic; (iii) foster good governance to improve 
public sector service delivery; and(iv) improve the quality of life by promoting human 
development. These reform priorities of the Government set an appropriate strategic 
policy direction for the country, and form the basis of the Bank’s support under the 
proposed CAS. 

.. 11. 

The CAS comes at a critical time as Lesotho confronts the macroeconomic and 
fiscal challenges arising from the global economic crisis. The crisis hit as Lesotho was 
gathering economic momentum driven by greater political stability and structural 
transformation of the last decade. The country had accumulated reserves from foreign 
direct investment (FDI) and windfall revenues from the Southern African Customs Union 
(SACU), and had become the largest exporter of clothing to the United States under 
AGOA. The public sector, expanded rapidly, with public spending increasing to 64.7 
percent of GDP in 2008/09. This progress is now threatened by the global crisis, which 
has resulted in a significant contraction of export markets and SACU revenues. As a 
result, Lesotho confronts the challenge of adjusting to a major economic shock while 
finding new sources of revenue and growth. 

iii. 
In the past, the Government of Lesotho (GOL) has demonstrated the resilience to 
rise to similar challenges and adapt to new circumstances, notably when they had to 
adjust to declines in remittances from the miners working in South Africa in the early 
1990s. Between 1990 and 2005, remittances dropped by roughly 15 percentage points of 
GDP, and an estimated 65,000 mining jobs based in South Africa were lost. The GOL 
responded to this external shock by creating 40,000 new jobs, increasing public sector 
spending and attracting private sector investments, fostered by a liberalized foreign trade 
regime. 

iv. 
Displaying the same spirit of resilience, the GOL is responding to the current 
external shocks with bold proposals of adjustment measures. To mitigate the impact of a 
projected sharp decline of SACU revenues from 35 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to jus t 14 
percent of GDP in 20 10/11 , the GOL has responded with a bold medium term strategy of 
aligning budget expenditures with enhanced capacity to raise non-SACU revenues while 
reducing public spending in the short run. The budget for 20 10/11 acknowledges the 
risks of continuing to treat the inherently unpredictable SACU revenues as an anchor for 
expenditure planning. It also proposes significant spending cuts, especially in major 
recurrent expenditure categories, in order to restore long term fiscal sustainability. A t the 
same time, the GOL recognizes a need to get better value for public resources by 
increasing efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. Implementation of such a 
major fiscal adjustment will, however, not be easy and poses major risks for GOL. The 

i v 

proposed menu of interventions under the CAS is framed within the context of this 
challenge. 

v. 
The global economic crisis has highlighted the country’s economic vulnerabilities 
and points to the necessity of accelerating progress in laying the foundations for 
economic competitiveness and export diversification. Towards this goal the GOL is 
proposing in the short term to: (i) continue building effective institutions, and (ii) 
improve service delivery by promoting efficiency and performance through the 
introduction of a results-based budgeting and finance management in the health sector 
and improved education quality. In the medium term the GOL has committed to: (i) 
explore new opportunities for sustainable private-sector led growth through an improved 
business environment and infrastructure development, (ii) position the rapidly growing 
Maseru area as a competitive node for the region and a new driver of growth; and (iii) 
target support to smallholder farmers, and exploit the potential for developing 
commercial agriculture with strong links to value chains in South Africa. 

vi. 
The GOL and the World Bank have agreed on three areas of engagement under 
the CAS: (i) fiscal adjustment and public sector efficiency, (ii) human development and 
service delivery, and (iii) competitiveness and diversification. Within these three areas, 
CAS activities will be grouped into six “results clusters” that take into account cross- 
sectoral impacts and aim to achieve results by strengthening institutional capacity as a 
cross-cutting issue. The CAS envisages increased budget support through annual Poverty 
Reduction Support Credits (PRSC), which would promote enhanced efficiency and 
quality of service delivery and economic competitiveness. 

vii. 
Given the difficult nature of the transformation that the country will be 
undertaking, achieving visible results will take time. Therefore, the CAS follows the 
approach of strategic incrementalism that focuses on delivering development outcomes in 
key strategic areas, while supporting the Government to gradually shift direction toward a 
new development paradigm. The Bank and the GOL will review the CAS 
implementation annually to assess progress and define the next set of strategic steps. A 
CAS Progress Report will be prepared at mid-term or before then if deemed necessary. 
To enhance the effectiveness of assistance, the CAS will seek to achieve synergies from 
the f u l l range of Bank instruments, lending, technical assistance, and analytical work to 
be delivered in partnership with the government and development partners. 

viii. 
Effective approaches to promoting gender equity will be mainstreamed into the 
Bank’s program. To maintain gender parity in primary education, the program will pay 
special attention to addressing the issue of primary school enrollment related to “herd 
boy” syndrome, where boys drop out from school to tend livestock. In health the Bank 
will support Lesotho to address the issue of maternal and newborn morbidity and 
mortality. A s women continue joining the workforce, the Bank will support the GOL in 
expanding training opportunities with a focus on women under the Private Sector 
Competitiveness and Diversification Project. In FY2013 the CAS proposes a Poverty 
and Gender Study to review progress on poverty reduction and gender equity. 

ix. 
The CAS will build on good practices established in the current CAS of 
leveraging the limited International Development Association (IDA) resources through 
strategic partnerships with the government and its many development partners using best 

V 

practices such as the Metolong Dam project where US$25 million of IDA resources 
helped mobilize US$300 million for the project, or the HIVIAIDS project, where US$5 
million of IDA grant is being used to improve the government’s capacity to implement 
projects worth more than US$ 100 million financed through the Global Fund and 
PEPFAR. In addition, the CAS will scale up successful ongoing interventions. 
x. scope and scale of the required adjustment; limited implementation capacity and weak 
The World Bank program in Lesotho faces risks from three sources: the difficult 
institutions; and low demand for improved governance in the public sector. Any or all of 
these can undermine the achievement of the CAS objectives. However, the GOL is 
cognizant of the changes required and, given Lesotho’s past history of effecting major 
transformations, these risks, while substantial, are manageable.

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) provides a framework for World Bank 
Group support to Lesotho for fiscal years (FY) 2010-14. It is aligned with Lesotho's Interim 
National Development Framework through 2012, when the Government intends to present a 
formal National Development Plan. The CAS comes at a difficult time as Lesotho confronts 
macroeconomic and fiscal challenges arising from the global economic crisis and a projected 
sharp decline in fiscal receipts from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU)'. The 
crisis has exposed the country's vulnerabilities to shifts in global markets and the continued 
dependence of the public sector on SACU revenues. 

2. 
The CAS seeks to support Lesotho's efforts to sustain economic growth momentum 
in the face of the global crisis and to address critical human development challenges by 
supporting Government efforts to undertake fiscal adjustment and strengthen public finance 
management, improve efficiency, quality and equity in access to basic services, and 
strengthen the competitiveness of the economy.

3 . 
Lesotho, a small country of 1.9 million people and an area of approximately the size 
of Belgium, is completely 
surrounded by the 
Republic of South Africa. 
Highlands constitute more 
than two-thirds of the 
country less than 10 
percent of which is suitable 
for cultivation. Lesotho, 
with its relatively cost- 
effective labor and 
abundant natural resources 
(diamonds and surplus 
wate?), is well placed to 
take advantage of its 
unique location inside the 
economic powerhouse in 
the region.

The Southern African Customs Union (SACU) is the world's oldest customs union with the first 
agreement signed in 1910. It includes Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland, and aims 
to maintain the free interchange of goods among member countries. The SACU provides for a common 
external tariff and excise tariff. All customs and excise revenues collected in the common customs area are 
paid into South Africa's National Revenue Fund for distribution among members according to a revenue- 
sharing formula. 
* Water, an abundant natural resource in Lesotho, is being exploited through the 30-year Lesotho Highlands 
Water Project, initiated in 1986. The project is designed to capture, store, and transfer water from the 
Orange River system to South Africa's Free State and greater Johannesburg area.

Over the last 15 years, Lesotho has demonstrated tha t it c a n se ize opportunities a s 
they ar ise a n d h a s diversified its economy from a reliance predominantly on subsistence 
agriculture and remittances to an economy based on manufacturing and water exports and 
services (figure 1). It has achieved moderate economic growth, taking advantage of the 
preferential trade regime under the 2001 U S . African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) 
to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and rapidly expand garment exports to the United 
States. It modernized management of natural resources and transformed its water surplus 
into sustained revenues by exporting it to South Africa. In addition, before 2009 Lesotho had 
managed relatively well the revenue windfall3 from the SACU. However, these structural 
transformations were not sufficient to enable the economy to achieve high sustainable growth 
rates to withstand the external shocks, or to substantially improve Lesotho’s social indicators. 
Poverty and inequality have remained high. 

5 . 
Poverty in Lesotho is concentrated in population living in isolated rural areas with 
limited income opportunities and high cost of service delivery due to the country’s difficult 
terrain and scattered settlements. As a consequence, Lesotho’s highland population has been 
migrating to the lowlands, attracted by economic opportunity and better services. As people 
move, Maseru, the capital, is emerging as an important economic node with the potential to 
become a growth hub and a key driver of Lesotho’s development. 

A. 

Political and Economic Context 

i. Political Economy and Governance 

6. 
Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy. The king is the nominal head of state, and 
executive power resides in a government led by the prime minister. At independence in 
1966, Lesotho’s political institutions were fragile and untested. This has changed 
significantly. Over the last decade, Lesotho has had three consecutive democratic elections, 
which have maintained the Lesotho Congress for Democracy Party in power. During the 
1990s, declining remittances from Basotho4 miners in South Africa combined with intense 
political contestation and constant splits of political parties overstressed the governance 
system and undermined stability resulting in elections-related protests in 1998. The 
economic transformation a t the beginning of the 2000s has expanded economic opportunities 
and helped improve political stability. 

7 . 
A s a small open economy within SACU and with its domestic currency pegged to 
the South African rand, Lesotho’s macroeconomic performance is closely linked with that of 
South Africa. While maintaining a balance between economic integration and national 
sovereignty, the GOL has harnessed opportunities arising from its geographical location 
including through the Highlands Water Project, access to a large market and good 
infrastructure to boost economic growth and create jobs . 

8. 
In the short to medium term, GOL will need to underpin its economic autonomy 
with a dynamic reform agenda. However, a combination of several factors makes this 

Large increase in SACU revenues from 25 percent of GDP in 2004/05 to about 40 percent of GDP in 
2006/07 and 37 percent of GDP in 2008/09.

politically difficult. Substantial external resources in the form of SACU revenues have 
artificially cushioned the public finance system and weakened the Government’s drive for 
needed reforms. Further internal demand for effective governance and accountability 
remains weak because of the ready availability of better paid jobs and services across the 
border. As a result, the society finds itself in a low level equilibrium in terms of government 
accountability with no strong pressure for change. 

9. 
In order to strengthen the performance of public finance management systems and 
institutions the GOL has embarked on several reforms to bring the state and non-state actors 
closer together and to boost demand for good governance. Recent examples include 
parliamentary reforms to improve oversight through portfolio committees, a pilot local 
government and decentralization system (2005-1 0), and the Service Delivery Agenda. GOL 
is also proposing to consult with a broad cross section of stakeholders on the country’s 
strategic directions in the context of preparing the National Development Plan. The current 
economic and fiscal shock is a trigger for a concerted effort by GOL to engage all 
stakeholders in the reform effort as a means to engender ownership and support for what will 
be a difficult period of adjustment. 

ii. Growth and Macroeconomic Development 

10. 
Lesotho’s economic growth leading up to the recent global recession averaged a 
respectable 3.4 percent a year during 2004-08. The main drivers of growth are described in 
Box 1. The phase-out of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Textiles and 
Clothing, of which Lesotho had been a major beneficiary, adversely affected economic 
performance in 2005. However, performance picked up strongly in 2006 (GDP growth of 
6.5 percent), driven by a recovery of the garment industry and increased diamond 
production. There was also a sharp increase in SACU revenues due to strong growth in 
South African imports in the midst of a booming global economy and restructuring of the 
SACU revenue sharing formula in favor of smaller SACU c o u n t r i e ~ . ~ GDP growth slowed 
to 2.4 percent in 2007 as agriculture faltered affected by a severe drought, and then 
recovered well in 2008, reaching a growth rate of 4.5 percent. The current account recorded 
a surplus of about 10 percent of GDP in 2008, and gross official reserves topped US$1 
billion by end-2009, far exceeding the official Central Bank of Lesotho target of US$640 
million required to keep the loti’s peg to the South African rand and providing more than 
seven months of import cover. However, the impact of the global economic crisis now risks 
unraveling this good overall progress. 

The 2002 SACU Agreement, which went into effect on July 15 ,2004 , revised the revenue sharing 
formula in favor of the smaller SACU members. 

1 1. 

The global economic crisis hit the Lesotho economy hard. A sharp projected decline 

Box 1: Recent Drivers of Growth in Lesotho 

Lesotho’s recent economic growth illustrates that the country can seize opportunities when they arise: 
Lesotho has attracted considerable FDI into manufacturing to support its economic growth. Over 
the past two decades, capital injections (largely from South Africa and Asia) in textiles and clothing 
manufacturing for export have driven GDP growth. More recently, foreign capital inflows have been 
motivated by Lesotho’s eligibility for duty- and quota-free access to the U S . market for textiles and 
clothing products under the 2001 U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). With exports 
of US$365 million during October 2007-September 2008, Lesotho was the largest exporter of 
clothing to the United States under AGOA, surpassing South Africa, Mauritius, and Madagascar. 
Lesotho remains a leader in Africa in attracting FDI (in per capita terms), despite a drop in net FDI 
inflows from the peak of US$287 million in 1996 to U S 8 1 million in 2009 (5 percent of GDP). 
Given its tremendous comparative advantages related to access to South African and SADC markets, 
Lesotho could still do better. 
Lesotho capitalized on its abundance of water and its geographic prox im i ty to South A f i ica through a 
series of progressive reforms that attracted South African investments to construct the first phase of 
the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. Between 1998 and 2006, royalties from water exports 
averaged some US$20 million a year. On a parallel track, the country developed a strong 
institutional capacity, so that Lesotho Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) is now widely 
recognized as one of the best performing sector agencies in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Lesotho successfully exploited diamond mining. Beginning in 2003, as world diamond prices rose, 
diamond mining attracted FDI. By the end of 2006, the sector generated revenues of US$90 million 
a year by producing small quantities of high-value stones. This achievement positioned diamonds 
behind only the clothing industry in export importance. In 2008 the global economic slowdown hit 
the sector hard as diamond prices plunged 50 percent from the first to the second quarter of 2008. 
Only the largest (Letseng-la-Terae) of Lesotho’s three operational diamond mines remains open 
today. 

in SACU revenues coupled with a slowdown in exports and declining remittances from South 
Africa are threatening the country’s macro stability. In 2009, GDP growth slowed to 0.9 
percentY6 held back by a major drop in U S . demand for Lesotho’s textile exports. An 
estimated 10,000 jobs had been lost in the textile sector as of end-2009, down from a peak of 
50,000 jobs in 2004. Weak world diamond prices hurt production and exports, bringing the 
mining sector to a standstill in the last quarter of 2008. 

12. 
The biggest impact of the crisis, which is expected to last through the medium term, 
is the precipitous decline in SACU revenues. With the sharp decline in South African 
imports since the onset of the crisis, the SACU revenue pool is shrinking, resulting in much 
lower customs collection and reducing Lesotho’s projected revenues (figure 2). After net 
repayments by Lesotho to the common revenue pool of approximately 5 percent of GDPY7 net 
SACU revenues are expected to drop from an estimated 35 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to jus t 
14 percent of GDP in 20 10/11, This steep decline would move the fiscal balance from a 
surplus in 2008/09 to an estimated deficit of 19 percent of GDP in 2010/11. 

These estimates reflect a large downward revision in growth rates compared with pre-crisis projections of 
5.2 percent for 2008 and 5.4 percent for 2009. 
’ SACU payments are made on the basis of the next year’s projected common revenue pool (CRP), with 
payments the following year reflecting the actual CRP. The actual CRP in 2008/09 was well below the 
original projections, resulting in net repayments due by recipient countries.

13 , 
The fiscal stance of the 
Government had been broadly 
prudent in the past; although public 
expenditures did shoot up during 
the past few years as a result of 
SACU windfalls. Initially the 
government saved a portion of 
additional SACU revenues by 
reducing public debt and 
increasing its deposits at the 
Central Bank. However, an 
expansionary stance in 2008/09 
increased total expenditures from 
48 percent of GDP in 2005/06 to 
jus t below 70 percent of GDP in 
2009/10, with most of the increases 
coming in current expenditure 
categories, which are typically 
difficult to roll back. 

14. 
Recognizing that very high levels of public expenditures were no longer sustainable, 
GOL has already initiated several belt-tightening actions under the 20 10/11 budget to curtail 
recurrent spending and align it with sustainable levels of domestic revenues. Viewing the 
current financial crisis as an opportunity, the 2010/11 budget seeks to mobilize more 
domestic revenues and cut wastefid expenditures and fraud and corruption in all its activities, 
while also encouraging greater efficiency in delivering public services. The budget envisages 
a major reduction in recurrent expenditures, largely through containment of the wage bill (to 
bring it gradually from the current 18 percent of GDP to 14 percent of GDP in 2 0 1 3 4 4 ) and 
reduction of expenditures on goods and services. On the revenue side the GOL is planning a 
wholesale revision of rates, charges and fines in line with inflation and is proposing 
extending the mandate of the Lesotho Revenue Authority to collect all revenues for the 
Government. These broad fiscal consolidation measures are promising, albeit necessary for 
ensuring fiscal sustainability. A crucial challenge ahead lies in preparing specific supporting 
proposals to ensure their proper implementation. 

15. 
Following trends in South Africa and global food and fuel price increases, consumer 
price index inflation peaked at 12.1 percent in September 2008. Since then, again in line with 
South African trends, inflation has moderated, and despite the recent upward movement in 
international oil prices, inflation was recorded a t 4.2 percent (year-on-year) in December 
2009. Broad money growth moderated from approximately 35 percent in 2006 to 
approximately 18 percent in 2009. 

iii. Macroeconomic Outlook 

16. 
Lesotho faces tough challenges in the medium term stemming from the uncertain 
global environment and lower SACU revenues. As the global economy recovers, Lesotho's 
growth is expected to rebound modestly from the estimated 0.9 percent in 2009 to about 3.6 
percent in 2010 and 201 1 (table 1). Recovery will be driven by moderate expansion in the 
garment industry through product and market diversification, growth in the non-garment

manufacturing sector (although from a small base),’ a pick-up in construction driven by 
public investment to support private sector growth,’ and resumption of mining. A surge in 
mining and construction activity is expected in 20 12 as a new diamond mine comes on- 
stream and the key works for the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project get 
under w ay . ”A s a result, GDP is projected to grow about 3.9 percent in 2012. If the 
highlands project is delayed, GDP growth would be about 2 .3 percent instead. 

17. 
South Africa’s economic recovery will continue to affect Lesotho’s prospects, with 
the most direct link being SACU revenues and workers’ remittances. The rebound in the 
outer years will depend on how quickly the South African economy recovers from the global 
crisis. South African growth will also be important for Lesotho’s external position; 
Lesotho’s export diversification to cater to the South African market is expected to 
compensate for the projected sluggish near-term recovery of the U.S. markets. 

18. 
The drop in SACU revenues in the medium term will lead to large fiscal deficit 
beyond 2009/10 on the order of 20 percent of GDP in 2 0 1 0 4 1 and 201 1/12. After 2012, 
SACU revenues are projected to return to the pre-boom level of about 20 percent of GDP. 
The buildup of government deposits a t the Central Bank, estimated at more than 4 billion 
Maloti (about US$500 million at the current exchange rate) and largely saved from SACU 
revenue windfalls in the past few years, will provide a cushion in the short term and together 
with the measures cited earlier is expected to ensure that the budget deficit is fully financed. 

Phillips has started operations in Lesotho to manufacture light bulbs and television equipment for the 
regional market. Other non-garment sectors showing potential are pharmaceuticals, footwear, and plastic 
hangers to supply to the garment industry. 
Donor-supported investment in the Metolong Dam and the second phase of Lesotho Highlands Water 
Project are key elements of the public investment program. 
l o As in the first phase of the project, South Africa is the key financier, with Lesotho expected to contribute 
25 percent of the costs of the project (more than 1 billion rand).

I / Fiscal data are reported on a fiscal year basis; the fiscal year begins in April. 

19. 
Over the medium term, the Government will need to embark on a course of strong 
fiscal consolidation, balancing cuts in Government spending and financing to address 
emerging fiscal deficits a s represented by the fiscal framework agreed under the Article IV 
consultations. That will involve increasing the efficiency of spending, especially capital 
expenditures, and rationalizing the payroll, while improving tax administration to boost 
compliance with the value-added tax (VAT), income tax collections, and other non-SACU 
revenue collection (see par. 37-41for a more detailed discussion of fiscal consolidation). 
The Government has indicated its intention to put in place measures to contain the projected 
fiscal deficit (excluding outlays for Metolong Dam) to approximately 15 percent of GDP in 
201 0/11. However, these measures will need to be sustained and reinforced beyond 20 10/11 
for the fiscal deficit to reach sustainable levels. 

20. 
Declining SACU revenues and falling garment exports will worsen the current 
account balance. While the impact will be countered somewhat by the resumption of mining, 
risks to the external balance remain in the medium term. The current account balance is 
expected to shift from a surplus of more than 9 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 22 
7 

percent of GDP in 20 10. Capital inflows, donor financing, and partial drawdown of reserves 
would sufficiently cover the current account deficit in 20 10. The current account deficit 
recovers to about 8 percent of GDP by 2013, largely because of some recovery in SACU 
transfers, exports, and remittances, which would also enable re-accumulation of foreign 
exchange reserves to more comfortable levels. 

2 1. 
Preliminary debt sustainability analysis shows Lesotho to be a t moderate risk of debt 
distress over the medium term. The risk has increased relative to 2009 assessment, reflecting 
large fiscal and external deficits expected through 2012/13. Debt ratios are projected to 
remain manageable over the medium term, assuming that the fiscal position returns to 
balance. At end-2008, the present value of external debt stood a t 33.2 percent of GDP. 

22. 
Under the baseline scenario, Lesotho's present value of debt to GDP ratio is projected 
to increase from 29 percent in 2009 to 35 percent by 2012 a s a result of debt incurred to 
finance fiscal deficits. The present value of debt to GDP ratio is projected to rise to 43 
percent by 2019, above the 40 percent indicative threshold," due almost entirely to 
borrowing for the second phase of the Highlands Water Project. The ratio is then expected to 
decline to 21 percent by 2029, as the fiscal position remains in balance. The present value of 
debt to exports and revenues would also rise through 20 19 but remain well below indicative 
thresholds for debt distress. There would also be a modest increase in the ratio of debt 
service to exports (from 4 percent to 5 percent) and debt service to revenues (from 3 percent 
to 6 percent), reflecting the increased stock of outstanding debt. The highly concessional 
nature of both existing debt and new borrowing (except for the rescheduled SACU payments 
and the borrowing for the Highlands Water Project) helps to contain the increase in debt 
service ratios and contributes to their return to lower levels as the impact of the SACU 
revenue shock begins to recede. 

B. 

Poverty and Human Development 

23. 
Lesotho's progress in moving from predominantly subsistence economy relying on 
overseas remittances to a lower middle income, diversified economy exporting natural 
resources and manufacturing goods has brought higher, more secure incomes to a significant 
portion of the population, and the percentage of the population living below US$ PPP 
US$1.25/day fell from 48 percent to 44 percent between 1995 and 2003.12 Opportunities in 
the urban labor market have been especially important for women, with the textile sector 
providing prospects for young women migrating from rural areas. But Lesotho's unequal 
income distribution (the Gini coefficient of 0.63 is among the highest in the world) and high 
level of unemployment (at 22.7 percent in 2008)13 dampened the effect of growth on poverty. 
Poor agricultural performance and declining opportunities for low-skilled Basotho in South 
Africa caused poverty to persist in rural areas, so that a substantial portion of the population 

l 1 The indicative thresholds for debt sustainability, proposed under the fiamework for low-income countries 
are 40 percent for the net present value (NPV) of the debt to GDP ratio, 150 percent for the NPV of the 
debt to exports ratio, 250 percent for the NPV of the debt to fiscal revenues ratio, 20 percent for the debt 
service to exports ratio, and 30 percent for the debt service to revenue ratio.

that was unable to diversify their sources of income did not directly benefit from economic 
growth. 

24. 
Lesotho has used public expenditures as a key tool in the fight against poverty. To 
reduce exclusion and inequality in opportunities, and ensure that all citizens are able to 
benefit from economic opportunities, Lesotho has substantially expanded access to social and 
economic infrastructure. The expansion of access to services led to progress in education and 
water supply, but the health care delivery system remained weak and combined with the 
scourge of HIV/AIDS caused Lesotho’s relative performance on the Human Development 
Index (HDI) ranking to fall from 127 of 174 countries in 1998 to 156 of 182 countries in 
2007. 

25. 
Lesotho has the third highest adult HIV prevalence in the world, at 23.2 percent: 26 
percent of women and 19 percent of men ages 15-49 are infected. Each day, an estimated 62 
people are newly infected and 50 people die due to AIDS. At the end of 2007, an estimated 
270,000 people in the country were living with HIV, 1 1,800 of them children. The number 
of AIDS orphans was estimated at 108,700 in 2007.

progress has been made in the roll-out 
of antiretroviral therapy has made 
good progress, with 38,586 people 
receiving treatment by 2008. The 
“Know Your Status” campaign 
boosted the number of people being 
tested for HIV to 229,092 by the end 
of 2007, 12 percent of the population 
and three times the number tested in 
2005. As a result, the annual rate at 
which adults in the population who are 
HIV-negative become HIV-positive 
declined from 2.9 percent in 2005 to 2.3 percent in 2007, lowering the estimated annual 
number of new infections from 26,000 to 21,560. These are the first signs of a decline in the 
HIV epidemic, but it is not yet clear what accounts for these reductions in new infections 
(most prevention programs were rolled out and scaled up after the reductions were observed; 
see Box 2 for additional information).

HIV/AIDS has had a negative impact on social indicators. Lesotho has the lowest 
life expectancy at birth among countries with similar income per capita (figure 3), and other 
indicators have also deteriorated. Infant mortality rose 2.5 percent, and under-five child 
mortality rose 33 percent over the last decade. The most recent maternal mortality estimates 
range from 762 to 960 per 100,000 live births, placing Lesotho in the 80th to 90* percentile 
g l ~ b a l l y . ’ ~ 

Box 2: HIV/AIDS Pandem ic: Trends, Challenges, Response, and Prospects 

Following a steep increase in HIV prevalence through the 1990s, the epidemic stabilized after 2000 at very 
high levels-almost 
a quarter of adults ages 15 -49 are HIV positive. Migrant labor was the key driver of 
epidemic, while multiple, concurrent sexual relationships before and during marriage are the main 
contributing factors. Although the rate of growth in new infections declined fiom 2 .9 percent in 2005 to 2 .3 
percent in 2007, many preventable HIV infections still occur each year in adults and children. 
The Government’s policy fiamework for HIV prevention is comprehensive, but it has not yet been translated 
into fully scaled-up programs. In 2006/07, only 10 percent of HIV/AIDS funding went to prevention, while 
33 percent went to care and treatment, 24 percent to program management, 13 percent to support for orphan 
and vulnerable children, and 11 percent to social protection, putting prevention in fifth place. Behavioral and 
social change interventions received only 2 percent of prevention funding in 2006/07. 
Recently, most behavioral messages have been related to the national campaign “Know Your HIV Status,” 
which helped tens of thousands of people learn their HIV status but which lacked a proper referral system for 
people testing positive and adequate post-test counseling for those testing negative. 
Partner reduction must be at the center of a successful behavioral and social change strategy. The country 
needs to redouble its efforts to reduce multiple partners among unmarried and married adults and youth. A 
key complementary measure is male circumcision, which can prevent up to 60 percent of new infections in 
men. Today, only about 15 percent of Basotho men are fully circumcised. Lesotho also needs more rigorous 
evaluations to determine what works in changing behavior to reduce new HIV infections. 
These actions to sharpen and refocus prevention are essential. In September 2008, antiretroviral therapy 
reached jus t 45 percent of those in need. Unless more new infections can be prevented, it will be difficult for 
Lesotho to maintain-let 
a lone expand-access 
to treatment. 

28. 
There are some areas, however, in which the Government has been making progress. 
Immunization coverage has remained above 80 percent, and antenatal care coverage is 
among the highest in Africa, at 90 percent. The share of children with diarrhea who receive 
oral rehydration therapy has nearly doubled since 2000. The Emergency Human Resources 
Plan seeks to strengthen training and recruitment, improve remuneration, introduce quality 
assurance mechanisms, and implement a ministry-led initiative to improve maternal health. 

29. 
Lesotho has achieved substantial gains in education since introducing free primary 
education in 2000. The net primary enrollment rate rose from 60 percent in 1999 to 82 
percent in 2008, among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lesotho has achieved gender 
parity in primary education. Most importantly, the probability of attending primary school is 
equal for the children from the richest and the poorest households. However, secondary and 
tertiary enrollment rates remain low-50 
percent and 4 percent in 2008-and 
budget 
allocation is skewed toward tertiary education (some 35 percent of the education budget).

are based on 2004 Demographic and Household Survey data; the next survey is expected to be finalized in 
several months. 

10 

Legal and regulatory framework to support a demand-driven technical and vocational 
education and training system is quite weak. 

30. 
Lesotho also has made notable advances in water services. Sustained investments in 
urban water supply since the late 1970s have paid off. Approximately 80 percent of the 
population has access to safe drinking water. A strengthened national Water and Sewerage 
Authority has reduced unaccounted-for water loss from 40 percent to 26 percent over the last 
five years. Lesotho was ranked 3rd among 24 African countries sampled over 1995-2005 in 
moving populations away from the use of surface water to higher levels of service, including 
increased access to piped water, longer hours of service and improved quality. 

111. LESOTHO’S VISION 

3 1. 
The GOL development goals are reflected in its “Vision 2020” and the Interim 
National Development Framework. “Vision 2020,” issued in 2002, articulates the long-term 
strategic priorities so that by 2020: 

Lesotho shall be a stable democracy, a united andprosperous nation at peace with itself 
and its neighbors. It shall have a healthy and well developed human resource base, a 
strong economy, a well managed environment and an established technological base.16 

32. 
Lesotho issued its Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2004 but has yet to fully implement 
it. In 2009, the Government developed the Interim National Development Framework, to 
serve as an interim strategic plan for the next two fiscal years while the four-year National 
Development Plan for 201 1/12-2015/16 is being drafted. The interim framework ratifies 
four priorities: (1) accelerate shared and sustainable economic growth, ensure employment 
creation, and protect the vulnerable; (2) address the HIV/AIDS epidemic; (3) foster good 
governance to improve public sector delivery; and (4) improve the quality of life by 
promoting human development. 

33. 
The Budget Speech for fiscal 2010/11 remained focused on the economic 
fundamentals of pursuing high, shared and sustainable growth; reducing poverty; creating 
jobs; and protecting the poor, orphans, and other vulnerable groups. l 7 While dealing with 
the consequences of the global economic crisis in the short term, the Government is also 
addressing medium- and long-term development needs. The 20 1 O / l 1 budget calls for belt 
tightening and for using the crisis as an opportunity to mobilize more domestic revenues and 
cut wasteful expenditures, fraud, and corruption in all Government activities by increasing 
efficiency in delivering public services and collecting taxes, fees;and other charges. It calls 
for reversing the growing culture of dependency on state hand-outs and for adopting a long- 
term fiscal strategy aligning expenditures and long-term domestic revenues and non-SACU 
revenues. In the medium term, public expenditures will focus on promoting growth through 
the development of a minimum infrastructure platform-roads, power, water, and 
telecommunications-to 
support private sector investment and build the necessary skills,

institutions, and structures. As appropriate, private sector financing for some large projects 
will be mobilized through public-private partnerships. 

34. 
In response to a request from the Minister of Finance and Development Planning, the 
World Bank prepared a series of economic policy notes, “Reshaping Lesotho’s Position in 
SACU to meet the Challenges of Sustained and Shared Growth.” The policy notes have 
provided an analytical underpinning for the Government’s growth strategy and the 2010/11 
budget. The main points deriving from the policy notes and from the recent poverty and 
gender assessment are reflected in the next section. 

IV. LESOTHO’S DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES 

35. 
Lesotho’s opportunities to sustain growth in the wake of the global crisis depend on 
its ability to manage the fiscal shock caused by the decline in SACU revenues in the short 
term and to develop new sources of growth over the medium and longer term, shifting its 
development paradigm from reliance on the public sector to reliance on the private sector as 
the chief economic engine. To do so, Lesotho needs to address three main challenges: (i) 
undertake a fiscal adjustment to absorb the sharp decline in SACU revenue and increase 
public sector efficiency, (ii) enhance economic competitiveness, especially within SACU, 
and (iii) advance human development and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS. In addition, 
Lesotho will need to address its weak institutional capacity, a major bottleneck to sustainable 
growth. Lesotho’s transformation path is likely to be long and bumpy, particularly in light of 
a much changed external environment following the global crisis. 

A. Fiscal Adjustment to Absorb the Sharp Decline in SACU Revenue and 
Increase Public Sector Efficiency 

36. 
Following a path toward fiscal sustainability over the next five years is critical for 
dealing with the major immediate challenge of the expected sharp decline in SACU revenues. 
In the past, Lesotho authorities have demonstrated that they can effectively respond to such 
challenges. For example, in early 1990s they successfully adjusted to a significant decline in 
remittances from the miners working in South Africa. Between 1990 and 2005 remittances 
dropped by roughly 15 percentage points of GDP and an estimated 65,000 mining wage jobs 
were lost. The GOL responded by increasing public investments and attracting FDI, fostered 
by a liberalized foreign trade regime, and creating 40,000 new jobs. 

37. 
To mitigate the current fiscal shock, the GOL will need to reprogram its fiscal 
priorities, improve tax collection, mobilize alternative sources of financing, and increase 
expenditure efficiency. The fiscal adjustment will require restructuring expenditures 
(identifying spending categories that can be reduced or postponed), while protecting 
allocations to social and growth-supporting activities. The Government has taken the first 
steps with the 20 10/11 budget, which assumes aggressive cuts in expenditures by reducing 
waste and inefficiency. 

3 8 . 
The short-term possibilities for increasing non-SACU revenues are limited because 
Lesotho’s tax system is already relatively well designed. Tax collection was recently 
improved, and non-SACU revenues already constitute about 27 percent of GDP.” However, 

l 8 See Policy Note on “Fiscal Challenge in Lesotho: Diagnosis and Options for Reform.” 

12 

on the revenue side, the 20 10/11 budget assumes a comprehensive revision of rates, charges, 
and fines and considers extending the mandate of the Lesotho Revenue Authority to collect 
all revenue for the Government. Over the medium term, the tax system can be enhanced by 
strengthening tax collection, improving the system of nontax revenues, increasing 
transparency, and expanding the tax base by improving the business environment to attract 
more investment. 

39. 
Fiscal consolidation on the expenditure side will need to be driven by cuts in both 
recurrent and capital expenditures. Substantial downward adjustments in the public sector 
wage bill and spending on goods and services should be the main elements of current 
expenditure consolidation. Cuts in expenditures on goods and services will require careful 
management and corresponding increase in the efficiency of expenditures to ensure delivery 
of key public services. 

40. 
Strengthening the effectiveness o f public spending and the accountability framework 
is at the core of fiscal consolidation. Lesotho’s public sector is large, with expenditures of 
approximately 70 percent of GDP (one of the highest in the world). The country has 
historically had a poor record of public sector governance. Transparency International 
ranked Lesotho 89 of 180 countries on its 2009 Corruption Perception Index. Lesotho’s 
ranking has declined steadily since 2005, when it ranked 70, picking up only in 2009. To 
address these concerns, the Government started a comprehensive reform program in 2005 
covering the budget cycle from formulation to legislative scrutiny and audit. The 2009 
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability scores showed only slight improvement 
because of the complexity of reform and limited implementation capacity. Remaining 
challenges include low utilization of the budget, especially of the public investment budget, 
and weak institutional capacity in development planning and project im p l em e n t a t i ~ n . ’ ~ 
Compliance with procurement rules is weak. Decentralization has transferred procurement 
decisions from the Central Tender Board to tender boards under the line ministries, while 
delays in adopting the Audit Bill and Public Financial Management and Accountability Bill 
have impeded oversight. In addition, the limited availability of budget information constrains 
oversight by civil society, the legislature, and the media in assessing Government policy 
implementation. 

41. 
To mitigate the consequences of the fiscal adjustment on poor people, the 
government will need to continue improving service delivery, including better provision of 
social safety nets, and to rely on the private sector to generate growth and employment 
opportunities. These challenges are discussed in turn below. 

B. Advance Human Development and Reverse the Spread of HIV/AIDS 

42. 
As mentioned earlier Lesotho’s human development indicators deteriorated over the 
past decade despite high levels of government social spending. Major challenges in human 
development stem from the country’s topography (about two-thirds of the population live in 
the hard-to-access highlands), high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, and weak service delivery. 
Facilitating access to social services while improving the quality and equitable coverage of 
services will become more difficult because of the fiscal squeeze following the economic

13 

crisis. However, there is considerable room for efficiency gains in the provision of health, 
education and social protection services. 

43. 
The health sector suffers from systemic weaknesses. Despite a serious HIV/AIDS 
epidemic, demand for health care (outpatient visits per capita and bed occupancy ratios) is 
very low. Quality of care, high transportation costs, long waiting times, and shortages of 
some drugs and equipment limit access and create a false impression of a low demand for 
services. The situation is exacerbated by severe human resources shortages, and even 
available trained staff is used sub-optimally. The problem is not a lack of resources. Lesotho 
spends about 6.4 percent of its GDP on health and social welfare, and the development 
assistance to health” as a share of total health spending has progressively increased from 6.4 
percent in 2002 to a high of 18.4 percent in 2008*l. A t the same time, utilization of donor 
and budget funds is poor (the execution of the health sector budget was 87 percent in 
2006/07) mainly because o f low capacity, weaknesses in public finance management and 
incomplete decentralization. The main task is to introduce a system of results-oriented 
budget planning and finance management using innovative models of performance-based 
financing aimed at addressing the perverse incentives both for managers of health programs 
and for the health personnel directly involved in service delivery. 

44. 
Lesotho declared HIVIAIDS a national emergency in 2000 and has taken steps to 
reduce the incidence rate. Limited progress in containing the epidemic arises not from lack 
of resources, which are abundantly available from development partners a s mentioned above, 
but from the complexity of implementation, which requires a coordinated, multisector 
response that strains the Government’s limited capacity. The challenge is to improve 
coordination to ensure that the substantial resources available to fight HIV/AIDS are used 
effectively. Experience suggests that harmonized support could improve results. For 
example, with the help of a previous World Bank HIV technical assistance project, which 
focuses on strengthening the GOL’s capacity in the sector, performance of the Global Fund 
grants has improved considerably. 

45. 
Important education challenges also remain. In recent years, Lesotho has 
demonstrated considerable commitment and leadership in improving basic education, which 
has delivered good results, especially in improving access. The next step is to improve the 
quality o f education (there is a dire shortage of school furniture, teaching materials, and 
textbooks in the language of instruction for grades 1-3 and repe t i t ion ra tes average 20 
percent and are a s h igh a s 29 percen t for grade 1 ) by upgrading school infrastructure (only 
48 percent of schools meet the minimum physical standards conducive to learning) and 
enhancing the quality o f teaching and learning (as much as 42 percent of teaching staff is 
unqualified), which need to be addressed. 

46. 
Lesotho also needs to better align the curricula and skills mix with the needs of the 
country. The higher education and technical and vocational education curricula are poorly 
matched to labor market needs, and students perform weakly in mathematics and science at 
all levels. Reforms-a 
training levy on industries, industry involvement in managing training 
and staffing to align the sector with industry requirements-have 
faced strong resistance.

There is no market-driven system to fund university education and technical and vocational 
training. International migration, mainly to South Africa, exacerbates the skills shortages and 
undermines Lesotho’s already weak capacity. 

47 . 
Developing a social protection strategy and putting in place effective social safety 
nets should be a key priority in an environment of economic downturn and fiscal squeeze. 
Currently, the GOL spends about 4 .2 percent of GDP on social protection, including old age 
pension, public assistance scheme, school feeding program, disability and other programs. 
The old age pension alone costs approximately 1.4 percent of the country’s GDP. However, 
social protection programs remain fragmented, uncoordinated, limiting the GOL’s capacity to 
respond quickly to new challenges. A review conducted by the CARE NGO in 2006 
provides evidence that traditional village and family networks are increasingly strained by 
new social vulnerabilities, and the piecemeal social protection approach currently in effect 
excludes a part of the population in need of assistance. Consolidation and better targeting 
would increase the efficiency of social protection programs in promoting inclusion and 
protecting the poor. 

C. Enhance Economic Competitiveness and Diversification 

48. 
Lesotho faces the challenge of creating an environment that generates adequate 
employment opportunities for the currently unemployed and for those who will soon join the 
unemployed ranks as a result of the fiscal squeeze. Although creating new jobs will take 
time, an improved investment climate, combined with an educated, cost-effective labor force 
and a strategy for harnessing new export opportunities, including better exploiting the 
regional markets, will improve Lesotho’s growth prospects. To support growth over the 
long term, Lesotho will need to address its infrastructure gap, especially for the rapidly 
growing Maseru area, and position this area as a competitive node for the region and as a new 
driver of growth. The country also can benefit from creating conditions for expansion in 
local entrepreneurship, improving the environment for agribusinesses, targeting support to 
smallholder farmers, and exploiting the potential for developing commercial agriculture with 
strong links to value chains in South Africa. The GOL will initially have to rely on FDI to 
support growth, while continuing efforts to strengthen the domestic private sector. 

49. 
Lesotho’s domestic private sector is small and w e a k A reliance on FDI as the driver 
of growth led to the neglect of domestic entrepreneurship in the past. The large public sector 
leaves little space for the domestic private sector, which is poorly organized and lacks 
influence over Government decision making. The Government has tried to address this 
challenge, through the Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC) and the Basotho 
Enterprises Development Corporation (BEDCO). BEDCO in particular has a mandate to 
train and support local enterprises to overcome the lack of skills and managerial capacity, 
provides physical space for businesses, and creates links to larger firms in Lesotho. However 
both these agencies have not been able to make significant inroads in supporting the domestic 
private sector due to organizational capacity and other challenges. Efforts to strengthen 
domestic entrepreneurship will need to be redoubled while working in parallel to attract 
foreign investors. 

50. 

A stable macroeconomic environment, a relatively low-cost and good-quality labor 
force, proximity to South Africa’s modern transport infrastructure, and a free trade 
environment within SACU - the biggest market in Africa - make Lesotho attractive to 

15 

regional and global companies seeking access to regional markets.22 Lesotho’s competitive 
potential for agriculture, tourism, and other sectors remains largely unexploited.

Figure 4: Lesotho Lags behind SACU Neighbors on 
Doing Business Indicators, 2008 and 2009 

To harness new growth opportunities and attract FDI, Lesotho needs to become more 
competitive, particularly within 
SACU, where Lesotho performs the 
worst in terms of Doing Business 
indicators (in 130th position in 2009). 
The Doing Business report reveals 
striking variation in indicators. 
Performance was worst on access to 
land, trade across borders, company 
start-up, licensing, and investor 
protection. Inefficient customs 
procedures and processes on 
Lesotho’s borders with South Africa 
hamper trade with this important 
neighbor. 
52. 
GOL recent efforts include the 
establishment in 2007 of a One-stop 
Business Facilitation Center for the 
issuance of import and export permits, 
rebate certificates, trade enterprise 
licenses, work permits (for textile companies), and residence permits for manufacturers. The 
processing time has dropped from 2-3 days to 5-6 hours for export permits and from 4 days 
to 1.9 days for import permits during the previous CAS period. Nonetheless, Lesotho still 
lags behind other countries in the region (figure 4). An immediate priority is adoption of the 
Companies Bill and the Industrial Licensing Bill, which has been held up by the political 
process, which would facilitate registration and ease licensing requirements.

53. 
Besides the business environment, Lesotho needs to deal with other barriers to 
economic activity such as access to land, infrastructure bottlenecks, and a skills mismatch 
exacerbated by the exodus of skilled personnel. 

54. 
Easing access to land is critical to promoting investment in industrial property 
development and agriculture. Foreign investors have no direct access to land titles in 
Lesotho, and there are sensitivities to foreign land ownership. With usable land scarce, 
Lesotho’s land policy aims to prevent a few from acquiring excessive land. Although leasing 
is a politically acceptable alternative, only citizens and firms with majority control by 
Lesotho citizens may lease land. The present system, in which the Land National 
Development Corporation leases land from the Government and subleases it to investors, is 
not functioning well. 

22 World Development Report 2009 highlighted that closer regional integration helps countries remove 
some supply-side constraints by enlarging markets, generating economies of scale in infrastructure and 
public good provision, and facilitating greater trade integration with the global economy. 

16 

55. 
Agriculture has significant growth potential in both the lowlands and the highlands 
and is the only source of income for many households in rural areas. Apart from land access, 
other barriers to achieving Lesotho’s agricultural potential includes agro-ecological and 
climatic conditions, including recurrent cycles of drought, erratic rainfall, hail and frost, and 
limited areas of arable land. Poor farming practices, limited use of quality seeds, and 
inappropriate selection of crops prevent achieving available production potential. In 
addition, the development of viable, market-oriented crop and livestock production faces 
multiple constraints. The land tenure system discourages investments in land improvements 
(irrigation, soil and water conservation measures, and tree planting). Commercialization 
efforts are undermined by market distortions caused by the Government’s involvement in 
commercial activities that are either not viable or should be left to the private sector. The 
Government is focusing on improving marketing infrastructure and the investment climate 
for commercial agriculture, targeting support to smallholders to increase their income 
opportunities, and addressing sustainable land-use practices. 

56. 
Overgrazing and climate change are likely to have a negative impact on agriculture 
and the quality of water. Lesotho is the water tower of Southern Africa, but its fertile soils 
are highly erodible. Inappropriate land-use practices and rising levels of human occupation 
have resulted in considerable erosion, depleting topsoil, reducing the quality of arable land, 
and contaminating water streams. In addition, several climate change models forecast that 
global climate change will reduce precipitation in Southern Africa, leading to higher 
evaporation losses and less runoff and groundwater recharge. Rangeland conditions may 
deteriorate as a consequence of changes in climate, lowering the quality o f livestock and 
livestock products. Addressing soil erosion and increasing the resilience to climatic changes 
can have multiple benefits, including restoring soil productivity and improving crop 
production. 

57. 
To support long-term growth, Lesotho needs to reduce the infrastructure gap, 
especially for the rapidly growing Maseru area, and position that area as a competitive node 
for the region and a new driver of Lesotho’s growth. Fiscal constraints imposed by the 
decline in SACU revenues mean that great selectivity is needed in prioritizing investment in 
infrastructure to high-growth, high-potential areas. The rapidly growing Maseru region, 
which is increasingly being held back by inadequate urban infrastructure, including the 
availability of water services and lack of factory shells for new and expanded businesses-all 
identified as bottlenecks to business development by potential South African investors. 

58. 
Inadequate, irregular water service is a constraint on new growth, particularly in 
Maseru and its environs, where most textiles and light manufacturing are based. The 
Metolong Dam and Water Supply Program, which will more than double the availability of 
treated water by 2014, will eliminate the source constraints for the existing water network in 
the greater Maseru area, but additional investments will be needed to accommodate new 
households in peri-urban areas. 

59. 
Lesotho also needs to complete its ambitious road network program and develop the 
institutional capacity o f the Road Directorate. Road transport is the mos t common mode of 
transportation in Lesotho, handling more than 90 percent of passenger traffic and some 66 
percent of goods transport. The quality o f the national road network improved from 27 
percent good and 38 percent fair in 2006 to 34 percent good and 43 percent fair in 2009. 
Average travel cost to services and markets along the Southeastern Corridor declined 20 

17 

percent between 2006 and 2009. In 2008, user fees accumulated in the Road Fund financed 
72 percent of routine and periodic road maintenance, up from 50 percent in 2005. However, 
falling SACU revenues will make it difficult to meet the substantial financing needs of the 
sector without scaled-up donor support. 

V. WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. Lessons from the Last Country Assistance Strategy 

60. 
The 2010 Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) finds that Bank 
programs achieved good results in areas where World Bank involvement was sustained and 
where institution building received strong attention, such as in water and education. The 
CASCR also found that analytic and advisory activities (AAA) were well aligned with 
country needs and priorities, that delivery of the lending program was on target, and that 
portfolio performance was satisfactory. 

61 , 
However, the CASCR notes limited progress on key challenges, many of which 
remain as they were at the time of the 2005 CAS: high incidence of HIV, mixed likelihood of 
reaching Millennium Development Goal targets, high levels of poverty and inequality, and 
weak competitiveness. Efforts to catch up with structural reforms, delayed by the political 
instability in the 1990s, were found to be straining limited government capacity, thus 
weakening the impact of World Bank and other development partners’ efforts. Observing 
that implementation has been impeded by the slow legislative process and incomplete 
reforms, the CASCR advises focusing on areas of reform where the Government shows 
strong leadership and building up capacity to ease critical implementation constraints in these 
areas. 

62. 
In addition, the CASCR calls for a sharper focus on the shared growth agenda to take 
advantage of the analytical work produced during the last CAS period. This work 
emphasizes agricultural and rural development, encouragement of entrepreneurship, and a 
rethinking of the role of the state, which now absorbs more than half of GDP. To bolster the 
country’s competitiveness, the CASCR sees a need to harness regional trade opportunities, 
beginning with trade facilitation and regional integration, especially with SADC. 

63. 
To better measure the development impact of the Bank’s program, the CASCR 
emphasizes the importance of monitoring and evaluation to continuously assess the 
development impact of the Bank’s program. The Bank should help the authorities develop 
monitoring capacity to track progress and improve the policy dialogue. 

B. Current World Bank Group Program 

64. 
International Development Association (IDA). Lesotho’s IDA portfolio comprises 
six projects with net commitments of US$100.7 million as of May 1 , 2 0 10. Portfolio 
performance is mixed with is one problem project in the portfolio - the Water Sector 
Improvement Project (FY2005). On the positive side, the disbursement ratio of 38.6 percent 
in FY2009 was above the regional average of 24.0 percent. 

65. 
The bulk of IDA financing is for infrastructure development-transport, water, and 
urban development. IDA is also funding projects in health and HIV/AIDS, and private sector 
18 

development. The Poverty Reduction Support Credit series has provided the overall policy 
reform framework. The IDA portfolio is supplemented by several grants. A Fast Track 
Initiative (FTI) grant supports primary education. A Global Partnership on Output-Based 
Aid grant supports a public-private partnership to replace the country’s 50-year-old main 
public hospital in Maseru through a joint undertaking with the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC), the transaction adviser for this project. A pioneering initiative, the 
project seeks to provide high-quality health care services to public patients at an affordable 
cost to the Government. IFC has also provided technical assistance on private sector 
development in tourism and export promotion. 

66. 
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency’s (MIGA) portfolio consists of two 
guarantees totaling US$lO million in gross and net exposure in the services sector. 

C. Principles of Engagement 

67. 
The CAS follows three guiding principles: partnership and alignment with 
Government strategic priorities, leveraging of resources for greater impact, and selectivity. 

6 8 . 
Partnership and alignment with Government strategic priorities. The Bank’s 
engagement with Lesotho is demand driven and builds on a strong relationship with the 
Government. In July 2009, the Prime Minister and Cabinet invited a Bank team to discuss a 
series of Policy Notes prepared by the Bank on how to improve Lesotho’s competitiveness 
and make its economy more resilient during a period of a global economic downturn.23 That 
discussion provided a framework for the CAS, opened new opportunities for engagement, 
and ensured close alignment of the Bank’s program and Lesotho priorities. 

69. 
This CAS benefited from extensive consultations with stakeholders in the country. 
Consultations, organized through two major workshops (at the onset of the CAS in 
September 2008 and after the upstream review in March 2010) were attended by more than 
150 participants-Government officials and representatives of academia, the private sector, 
and civil society. Participants supported the CAS strategic focus and provided their insights 
on Lesotho’s social challenges, growth potential, and the ways the Bank could better assist 
the country. The GOL has endorsed the CAS’S strategic focus and program. Annex 3 
describes the consultation process in more detail. The CAS aims to continue strengthening 
the partnership with the Government and civil society through policy dialogue informed by 
analytic work and through the involvement of civil society in project implementation. The 
Bank will strengthen its communication strategy to improve its dialogue with state and non- 
state actors. 

7 0 . 
Leveraging of resources for greater impact. The CAS will continue to play a 
catalytic role in leveraging other donor resources and building effective collaboration with 
development partners. It will build on the comparative advantages of development partners 
to complement IDA resources, particularly for large infrastructure projects; to scale-up 
successful IDA and other donor projects; and to provide technical assistance to strengthen 

23 The one-day seminar with the Cabinet, titled “Reshaping Lesotho’s Position in SACU to Meet the 
Challenges of Sustained and Shared Growth,” considered four issues: fiscal challenges and options for 
reform; effective use of public resources, particularly for capital expenditure supporting growth; 
agr icu l ture-cha l lenges and directions for agribusiness; and realizing FDI to diversify Lesotho’s exports , 

19 

Government capacity to use donor funds effectively. The CAS also seeks to achieve 
maximum synergy among interventions by the Government, World Bank Group, and other 
development partners by seeking complementarity across sectors and interventions, including 
lending, grants, and AAA. 

71. 
S e l e c t i v ig . Because IDA’S allocation is small relative to Lesotho’s needs, the CAS 
strives to be selective in the number and choice of lending instruments, applying four 
selection criteria to new operations: strong Government ownership and commitment, 
improved governance and accountability mechanisms in the sector to support sustainability, 
cooperation with development partners, and past success that can be scaled up. In line with 
the latter, and taking into account the lesson from the CASCR that sustained engagement in a 
sector is important for success, the CAS envisages additional financing for projects in sectors 
such as water and transport that have made good progress in institution building and need to 
consolidate achievements to enhance sustainability. The principle of selectivity will also be 
reflected in a new approach to the AAA program, which will be more focused and better 
coordinated than in the past. This approach is described in the section on the IDA program. 

D. Strategic Areas of Engagement 

72. 
The FY2010-14 CAS seeks to assist the Government in addressing its short-term 
needs to deal with the sharp decline in SACU receipts and improve social development 
indicators. It will also work with the Government to enhance competitiveness and foster 
private sector-led growth over the longer term. To achieve these objectives, the Government 
and the Bank have agreed that the CAS would focus on three areas of engagement that are 
fully aligned with the country’s Interim National Development Framework: 

Fiscal adjustment and public sector efficiency. 
0 Human development and service delivery. 
Enhanced competitiveness and diversification. 

73 . 
Applying the lessons of the previous CAS, this CAS will embed institutional 
strengthening and capacity development in all interventions, including IDA credits, AAA, 
technical assistance, knowledge sharing, and development partnerships. Project design will 
be simplified and tailored to institutional capabilities. A Governance and Capacity 
Assessment Study will be conducted early on to detect governance weaknesses, institutional 
and capacity constraints, and bottlenecks that can inform the Bank program. The Bank will 
support demand-side governance through involvement of non-state actors to the extent 
possible in preparation and implementation of the Bank program. 

74. 
The World Bank Group will follow the guiding principles of the Bank’s Regional 
Integration Assistance Strategy (MAS ) to assist Lesotho in taking advantage of “win-win” 
possibilities in the regional context created by specialization and higher efficiency levels not 
accessible through the national development programs. To address the regional challenges of 
Lesotho (e.g. HIV/AIDS, TB), the CAS will rely on country-specific as well a s regional 
initiatives be it AAA, knowledge sharing or the institutional complementarities of the 
neighboring countries. 

20 

E. Proposed IDA program 

75. 
Lesotho’s IDA envelope for FY2010-14 is indicative and assumes that country 
performance will improve. The CAS covers the last two years of IDA15 and the full three 
years of IDA16. The indicative IDA1 5 allocation is approximately US$71 million (SDR44.8 
million, including SDR20 million in grants and SDR24.8 million in credits) and US$15 
million from the Crisis Response Window. US$55 million has already been committed in 
FY2009 and FY2010. The indicative IDA16 allocation is assumed to be approximately 
US$28 million a year. The proposed IDA program (lending, grants, and AAA) is presented 
in table 2. 
76. 
The IDA envelope is small relative to the country’s needs. Therefore, as discussed 
before, the Bank will seek to leverage other donor resources and tap into supplemental 
sources of financing, such as grant facilities and trust funds. The program will also be 
delivered in partnership with IFC. To enhance the effectiveness of Bank assistance, the CAS 
will rely on synergies among lending, technical assistance, and analytical work to be 
delivered in partnership with the Government, other development partners and the Bank 
team, which itself will work as a one well coordinated team. In line with this, the policy 
reform agenda supported by the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) series, will serve 
as an umbrella for other lending operations. 

77. 
IDA lending will be complemented by a strong, demand-driven AAA program, which 
will follow a new approach. The AAA program will be developed with the Governance and 
Capacity Study a s the centerpiece with other tasks, such as Public Expenditure Review and 
other AAA, being parts of the umbrella activity. The AAA studies are expected to be 
mutually reinforcing. This will allow the analytical studies to be prepared in an integrated 
manner, using the political economy angle, including strengthening the demand for good 
governance, in all Bank activities. It will also help the team to better integrate the sectoral 
analytical work under a common agenda. To illustrate this approach, the Public Expenditure 
Review will be prepared in close cooperation with the GOL and will discuss strategic 
expenditure choices and the Governance and Capacity Study will assess governance 
constraints and capacities to implement these choices. Other studies, e.g., the Post-basic 
Education Study and Poverty and Gender Assessment, will be informed by these two studies. 
The Bank will pay greater attention to dissemination of AAA to large audiences and will use 
it as a tool in strengthening communication with state and non-state actors in Lesotho. 

78. 
The CAS envisages some degree of flexibility to address the complexity of the 
current challenges and the need to adjust to changing circumstances. CAS implementation 
will be reviewed annually together with the GOL to assess progress and propose necessary 
adjustments to the Bank program and strategic approach. A CAS Progress Report will be 
prepared at mid-term or even before then if deemed necessary. Projected lending in the outer 
years (FY2013 and FY2014) will be reviewed at the time of the CAS Progress Report and 
may be adjusted depending on IDA allocations and progress toward CAS objectives. The 
IDA portfolio performance will also be reviewed periodically and projects will be 
restructured as needed and freed up resources will be redirected to emerging priorities.

Effective approaches to promoting gender equity will be mainstreamed into the 
Bank’s program. To maintain gender parity in primary education, the Bank program will pay 
special attention to addressing the issue of primary school enrollment related to “herd boy” 
syndrome, where boys drop out from school to tend livestock. In health the Bank will 
support GOL to address the critical issue of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. 
As women continue to participate in the workforce, the Bank will support the GOL in 
expanding training opportunities with a focus on women under the Private Sector 
Competitiveness and Diversification Project. Finally, the Bank’s AAA program will look 
into gender inequality from different angles be it access to tertiary education or poor 
governance and institutions that often take higher toll on women. In FY2013 the CAS 
envisages a Poverty and Gender Study to take stock of poverty reduction and gender equity. 
80. 
The Bank expects that positive and timely implementation of the CAS program will 
pave the way for Lesotho to move to blend status under the next CAS. In the meantime, 
Lesotho can benefit from IBRD financing through enclave projects, as was done in financing 
the first phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. 

22 

F. CAS program and results 

8 1 . 
The Bank will focus on specific achievements (outlined in the Results Matrix) in 
areas considered critical for success following an approach of strategic incrementalism. 
Given the difficult nature of the transformation through which the country is moving, 
achieving visible results likely will take time. Therefore, the focus will be on achieving 
specific modest outcomes in key strategic areas which can then be built on over time. 

82. 
The CAS results framework is organized in six results clusters, with attention to some 
early results to build momentum for reform. Figure 5 illustrates the CAS areas of 
engagement, results clusters, and potential impact of the Bank’s program. Outcomes in the 
three areas of engagement are expected to reinforce and complement each other. The CAS 
will support Lesotho in unleashing potential for private sector growth with the focus on 
improved business environment for FDI and local entrepreneurship development. It will also 
assist in prioritizing the budget spending and increasing public sector efficiency to avoid any 
major negative impacts of the fiscal adjustment on critical public services important for 
human development and longer term growth. In turn, improved business environment will 
allow expanding the tax base and increasing non-SACU budget revenues in the long run, 
facilitating the fiscal adjustment. Better social outcomes will enhance labor force 
competitiveness and facilitate sustainable growth. Special attention will be given to ensuring 
that the needs of the most vulnerable groups of population, especially women, are taken into 
account, particularly during the period of fiscal consolidation.

i. Fiscal Adjustment and Public Sector EfJiciency 

83. 
To help Lesotho make the necessary fiscal adjustments in response to the sharp 
decline in SACU revenues, the World Bank Group will support the Government?s efforts to 
curtail budget spending, improve public sector performance and the efficiency of resource 
use. The Bank?s engagement will be aligned with the key priorities of the Government?s 
Public Sector Improvement and Reform Program. 

84. 
World Bank Group assistance in this area is grouped into two results clusters: fiscal 
adjustment and increased public sector efficiency (results cluster 1) and stronger public 
financial managemen t , statistics, and institutional capacity (results cluster 2).

85. 
The CAS will support the Government?s efforts to develop options to address the 
decline in SACU revenues. To assist with fiscal consolidation, an expanded Poverty 
Reduction Suppor t Cred i t (PRSC) series will help to close the financing gap resulting from 
the decline in SACU receipts by supporting policy reforms and providing additional 
resources. The PRSC series will accompany expenditure restructuring into the medium term, 
supported by a programmatic Public Expenditure Review prepared by the Bank and the 
Government. The CAS emphasis on improving the business and investment climate is 
expected to expand the tax base in the longer run. 

86. 
With Government spending already high and prospects for new spending limited, 
public investments need to be prioritized. The CAS will support Government efforts to 
reprogram capital expenditures, directing resources into investments and programs to 
enhance growth and development. The CAS will focus on strengthening institutions and 
removing capacity constraints that have slowed capital expenditures (only an estimated 72 
percent of capital appropriations have been used in 2009/10). The CAS will support the 
revival of the Project Appraisal Committee and provide technical assistance to strengthen 
project cycle management across the Government. A jo in t team with World Bank Institute 
will train officials in critical areas identified by the authorities, including project 
management, contract management, procurement and financial management, and leadership, 

87. 
The Bank will support Lesotho?s effort to better protect poor and vulnerable groups 
of population through analysis of social protection expenditures, social safety net targeting 
and coverage, efficiency, and institutional arrangements. A resultant set of policy 
recommendations will feed into Government effort to develop a comprehensive social 

24 

protection strategy for Lesotho. The Bank will also engage with other development partners 
to assist Government efforts to address the needs of orphans and vulnerable children. 

Results Cluster 2: Strengthen Public Financial Management, Statistics, and 
Institutional Capacity to Deliver Better Services 

quality financial statements 

8 8 . With expenditures constrained over the medium term, to build institutional capacity 
to deliver services and improve public sector governance, the CAS will focus on three areas 
that are reducing the quality of outcomes and the efficiency of budgetary expenditures: 
bringing transparency, accountability, and credibility to the budget; introducing policy-based 
budgeting and improving the statistical system; and upgrading public investments. With 
support from the World Bank (PRSC and technical assistance) and other development 
partners, work is under way in areas from policy design to procurement and implementation. 
The work emphasizes training in procurement, accounting, and financial management based 
on an upgraded qualification framework. 

89 . 
The CAS supports a public financial managemen t reform agenda to improve 
budgetary outcomes through fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, and efficient 
service delivery. To track progress in the Public Service Improvement and Reform program, 
the Bank and other development partners will use Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability  assessment^.^^ The emphasis will be on improving alignment between 
budgetary allocations and national priorities, improving reporting and transparency, 
modernizing procurement practices, and developing a culture of audit. A Report on the 
Observance of Standards and Codes accounting and auditing diagnostic exercise and follow- 
up capacity building activities will strengthen accounting and auditing infrastructure. 
Qualified personnel (including accountants and auditors), backed by high quality standards, 
monitoring, and enforcement, are expected to become safeguards against malpractice and 
instruments for improving governance and anticorruption programs, generating citizen 
confidence and trust in public institutions. The Bank team will mobilize technical assistance, 
including Institutional Development Fund grants, governance and anticorruption fimding, and 
trust funds, to support Government capacity building and improve governance. The Bank 
and other development partners are considering a basket fund to support public financial 
management reforms. 

24 The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) program is financed jointly by the World 
Bank, European Commission, and the UK Department for International Development.

ii. Human Development and Service Delivery 

90. 
During the CAS period, the Bank Group will assist Government efforts to enhance 
human development. Bank Group engagement in Lesotho in human development and 
service deIivery has covered a broad set of interventions in health and HIV/AIDS, water, 
education, and skills development targeting improved access, equity, and quality of services. 
Skills development has been progressing well, but social indicators have not improved, 
signaling that more work lies ahead. 

91 , 
World Bank Group assistance in this area is grouped into two results clusters: 
reversing negative trends in health and improving access to services (results cluster 3) and 
building skills to enhance competitiveness (results cluster 4).

92. 
The CAS will support Government efforts to contain the incidence of HIV/AIDS by 
assisting the Government institutions responsible for the national HIV/AIDS response to 
access international funds, use them effectively, and measure their impact. Better 
coordination and implementation capacity are expected to increase disbursements and 
satisfactory implementation of subprojects financed through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis, and Malaria grant. Prompt evaluation will permit development partners to 
adjust their approaches as needed. Although the Bank’s contribution in resources is small, it 
can have a major impact by boosting the effectiveness of the substantial resources available 
from other development partners. The CAS seeks to strengthen the capacity for 
implementing the HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan and scaling up effective HIV interventions. In 
addition, the CAS results will be reinforced through implementation of the regional IDF grant 
(Regional Capacity Building and Knowledge Sharing in Strengthening Health Systems), 
which includes capacity building support to Lesotho on TB lab strengthening. 

93. 
The CAS will continue assisting Lesotho’s efforts to increase access to hospital 
services and improve their quality, comply better with health service standards, and reduce 
post-operative infections. Progress will be measured through periodic surveys of client 
satisfaction. IDA and IFC are helping the Government establish a public-private partnership 
to build and operate Lesotho’s new National Referral Hospital, which will serve the bulk of 
the population. Better management practices are expected to improve service delivery and, 
complementing other efforts such as the fight against HIV/AIDS, should result in better 
health outcomes. The Bank will focus on strengthening the foundation for this public-private 
partnership through the ongoing grant under the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid. 

26 

94 . 
A complementary program that will contribute directly to better health outcomes is 
the Bank’s ongoing support to increase access to potable water. As mentioned under results 
cluster 6 (below), the Bank will continue to implement phase 2 of the Water Sector 
Improvement Project, which is part of a multidonor-funded program to improve the supply of 
water to Maseru and nearby areas, and will support capacity building of an independent water 
regulator and continued strengthening of water sector institutions and the policy framework.

95. 
The CAS will support Lesotho’s efforts to improve the quality of primary education, 
boost enrollment in post-basic education, and better align higher education with labor market 
needs. The country’s strategy is to deepen the reforms in basic education to improve quality, 
as measured by periodic examinations, and to increase access to secondary and tertiary 
education as more young people complete primary education. To improve primary 
education, the CAS intends to increase the proportion of classrooms that meet basic standards 
of adequacy and to upgrade teachers’ qualifications through the multidonor Catalytic Fund 
Grant for the Education for All Fast Track Initiative (FTI) managed by the Bank. This 
operation is expected to lay the foundation for a sector pool fund that will channel donor 
funds to the sector strategy. 

96. 
The Bank program will continue to emphasize skills development and capacity 
building so that the education and private sectors can better respond to labor market needs. 
The CAS will support activities to improve the quality of university education and technical 
and vocational training standards. The Bank will also assist in the process of reforming post- 
basic education so as to make it more consistent with the economy’s growth path, less 
expensive, and more financially accessible for all. This work will be undertaken initially 
through AAA (the Post-Basic Education and Growth Study), which will inform a proposed 
education project later in the CAS period The CAS will also evaluate the experience of the 
public-private partnerships in the skills development program for the textiles and garments 
industry, supported under the Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic Diversification 
Project and explore opportunities to expand this program 

97. 
In partnership with the World Bank Institute and the Government of Lesotho, the 
Bank will customize its knowledge and learning program to enhance Lesotho’s capacity in 
selected areas on a pilot basis. A governance and capacity assessment will examine capacity 
constraints that limit sustainable growth. The Bank will work with Lesotho to develop and 
implement a strategy to attract and retain qualified members of the diaspora from the region 
and globally. The CAS will also support the Government in establishing incentive structures 
to retain qualified staff and attract those who have left. Through a proposed Institutional 
Development Fund grant, the Bank’s Africa Region Diaspora Team will work closely with 
the Government to develop and implement its strategies for engaging the diaspora in selected 
sectors, such as health and education. 

27 

iii. Economic Competitiveness and DiversiJcation 

98 . 
The CAS will assist Lesotho to take advantage of its competitive labor costs, 
proximity to South Africa’s modern transport infrastructure, and duty-free access to regional 
markets. The CAS program targets two result clusters: improving the business environment, 
trade facilitation, and export diversification (results cluster 5) and reducing the infrastructure 
gap and improving capacity to regulate infrastructure services (results cluster 6 ) . These 
efforts will unleash the growth potential of the country and enable the Maseru area to attract 
more investment. CAS support for a better business environment, improved interface with 
South Africa, access to factory shells for new business, reduced transportation costs, and 
increased availability of skills will all contribute to building Lesotho’s economic potential.

99. 
The CAS will support improvements in the business environment, economic 
diversification and the capacity of small and medium-size enterprises through the ongoing 
Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic Diversification Project, PRSC series, and 
targeted AAA. Strengthening the legal framework will be a priority, along with building 
capacity to streamline the regulatory environment and implement the reforms. These steps 
should help Lesotho improve its Doing Business ranking in a t least four categories: trading 
across borders, setting up a company, accessing land, and protecting investors. The CAS also 
will support measures to ease access to land and promote investment in industrial property 
development. The CAS will support strengthening the performance of the Land National 
Development Corporation and Basotho Enterprises Development Corporation and the 
charting of a path to a stronger and more effective role for both. 

100. 
IFC will explore ways to facilitate access to finance for micro, small, and medium- 
size enterprises in Lesotho and will strengthen ongoing discussions with stakeholders 
including local banks, the Government, and multilateral agencies. Subject to economic 
viability and identification of appropriate partners, IFC’s potential interventions in Lesotho 
over the CAS period will include the following: 

28 

a 

a 

a 

a 

Ap ican Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Program, to support financial 
institutions in rapidly and profitably ramping up banking services for these 
enterprises, while maintaining good asset quality. 
Microfinance investment, to identify and invest in a commercial microfinance 
institution. 
Small and Medium-size Enterprise Risk Capital Fund, to replicate in Lesotho IFC’s 
successful partnerships with fund managers focused on small and medium-size 
enterprises in Kenya and Madagascar, subject to the underlying proposed h n d being 
commercially viable. 
Small and medium-size enterprise management solutions, to improve the business 
performance and competitiveness of firms: the Small and Medium-size Enterprise 
Toolkit, a web-based solution offering free business management information and 
training to firms in accounting and finance, business planning, human resources, 
marketing and sales, operations, information technology, and other resources to help 
entrepreneurs start, finance, formalize, and grow their businesses; and the Business 
Edge, a comprehensive set of practical and flexible management training products 
and services to improve enterprise performance, including an international standards 
curricula tailored to management training needs and local markets for small and 
medium-size enterprises. 

101. 

The CAS will support a trade and diversification agenda to develop the domestic 
private sector and increase FDI. The strategy will encourage collaboration between the 
Lesotho Revenue Authority and the South African Revenue Service, opening new 
opportunities for trade and investment facilitation. A new area for Bank support, this is a key 
component of Lesotho’s regional integration agenda designed to lower trade costs and 
expand the private sector. To facilitate trade between Lesotho and South Africa, customs 
infrastructure at the Maseru Bridge and Maputsoe can be transformed into a one-stop border 
for processing applications from both agencies by establishing a computerized single window 
and customs clearance system and reducing infrastructure constraints. If successful, this 
partnership could become a model for the SACU/SADC region. To support this undertaking, 
the Bank will provide financing through the recently launched Trade Facilitation Facility 
managed by the International Trade Department and implemented by AFTFE. 

102. 
Responding to the Government’s request, the CAS will step into a new area of 
engagement in Lesotho with potentially high social returns and impact on wealth creation: 
agriculture and rural development. The focus would be on increasing income and 
employment opportunities in smallholder agriculture by boosting crop diversification through 
attracting private investments and enhancing the productivity and marketability of 
agricultural products and by encouraging sustainable land management. Support would come 
from a World Bank-International Fund for Agricultural Development co-financed program 
for investments in productivity improvements, agricultural technology, sustainable land 
management, value chains, and market access. 

103. 
In the area of environment and biodiversity protection the Bank will be prepared to 
respond to potential GOL’s interest in mobilizing resources as part of GEF 5 to continue its 
biodiversity activities. 

29 

Results Cluster 6: Reducing the Infrastructure Gap and Improving Capacity to 

104. The CAS will continue to support the road and transport sector to consolidate 
progress in improving key transport networks that open new corridors. The CAS will also 
support upgrading selected rural roads to improve access to isolated areas and deliver a better 
managed and more affordable transport system. These programs are expected to reduce 
travel cost to social services and markets. The Bank will continue to support institutional 
strengthening of the sector, including the recently established Roads Directorate and the 
Road Maintenance Fund, and efforts to achieve sustainable financing for road maintenance 
through the ongoing Integrated Transport Project and proposed additional financing. 

105. The Bank will continue its engagements in the water sector to meet the growing 
demand for good quality water from industrial users in the Maseru area and to increase 
Lesotho’s water exports to South Africa. The Bank will follow a programmatic approach 
involving the Government and development partners through the Ministry of Natural 
Resources, the Commissioner of Water, and the Water and Sewerage Authority. The 
instruments are the ongoing water projects and a proposed new operation for the Maseru 
area. The CAS program will continue to provide technical assistance for the development of 
regulatory tools and other capacity development for the water and electricity regulator. In 
addition, the Bank is prepared to explore the possibility of a new IBRD enclave project in 
support of the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. 

106. Finally, the Bank will provide support to the Maseru City Council to develop an 
effective urban planning and transport system. Under the Integrated Transport Project, an 
institutional and financial overview of urban planning and management activities will be 
carried out, focusing on transport services to Maseru in the short and long terms. The Maseru 
Urban Development Study will identify the gaps and bottlenecks expected to emerge as the 
city grows and will propose solutions, including housing development and better urban 
services. 

G. Results Monitoring and Management 
107. 
The CAS results matrix developed in partnership with the Government of Lesotho 
tracks progress in the main areas of engagement. The Bank team will track progress through 
annual impact reviews at the time of the joint GOL/Bank CAS review, using a recently 
piloted Country Program Results Monitoring tool. The Bank teams will work directly with 
Government agencies to track results and identify factors affecting them. The CAS Progress 

30 

Report will reevaluate the results framework in light of implementation, exogenous 
developments, and adjustments to the Bank’s program. 

108. 
In addition, the CAS will help the Government of Lesotho strengthen its statistical 
capacity. The Bureau of Statistics has begun to develop a National Strategy for the 
Development of Statistics based on the Paris 21 Principles. The Bank supports these efforts 
through the PRSC series and will complement them with self-standing technical assistance 
and a potential project in cooperation with other development partners. The 2006 census 
provided solid benchmarks for tracking progress toward development outcomes, particularly 
on social issues, for which results-tracking has been weak. To further address the issue of 
data inadequacy to enhance the decision making, the Bank jointly with other development 
partners stands prepared to assist in strengthening capacity for collecting regular and better 
quality data and developing tools to analyze it. 

H. Development Partners 

109. Strong development partnerships will continue under the CAS. Donor coordination, 
alignment, and harmonization have improved since the formation in 2005 of the 
Development Partners Consultative Forum, co-chaired by the United Nations Development 
Program and Irish Aid. The forum includes resident and nonresident development partners. 
The resident development partners are the European Commission, UN agencies, World Bank, 
Peoples Republic of China, German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), Irish Aid, Government of 
Libya, U.K. Department for International Development, U.S. Government, and French and 
Danish Honorary Consuls. The nonresident development partners include the African 
Development Bank, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and Japan, among 
others. The forum seeks to improve communication and promote transparency between 
development partners and the Government by strengthening aid coordination, promoting 
harmonization, and supporting the Government in strengthening ownership of development 
processes as set forth in the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda of Action. The forum 
enables partners to discuss current and planned activities, coordinate programs, and promote 
efficient and effective delivery of projects to benefit Lesotho. The donor activities mapped 
along the CAS areas of engagement are captured in annex 4. 
1 10. 
World Bank partnerships with other donors will build on successful operations jointly 
financed with other donors, such as the Integrated Transport Project (with the European 
Commission) and the US$300 million Metolong Dam project (with the U S . Millennium 
Challenge Corporation, the European Investment Bank, the Arab Bank for Economic 
Development in Africa, the OPEC Fund for International Development, the Kuwait Fund, the 
Saudi Fund, the Republic of South Africa, and the Government of Lesotho). The Bank’s 
US$25 million credit for the Metolong Dam Program supports critical environmental and 
social safeguards and finances the construction of a transmission main to the town of 
Teyateyaneng. The Bank’s HIV/AIDS Technical Assistance Project, a US$ 5 million IDA 
grant, helps to f i l l the capacity gap impeding implementation of the HIV/AIDS National 
Strategic Plan. 

1 1 1. Under the CAS, IDA funds will be used to catalyze donor resources through several 
instruments, including joint donor budget support with the African Development Bank, UK 
Department for International Development, and the European Commission; a joint 
agricultural project with the International Fund for Agricultural Development; and sector- 

3 1 

wide approaches (SWAPS) with Irish Aid. The World Bank Group will explore possibilities 
for other operations to be prepared and implemented in close partnership with donors, 
building on successes and lessons learned. 

VI. RISKS 

I 12. 

The Bank program in Lesotho faces substantial risks stemming from three sources: 
the difficult scope and scale of the required adjustment; limited implementation capacity and 
weak institutions; and weak demand for good governance. The issue of data inadequacy is a 
serious constraint to effective monitoring of the program performance that exacerbates the 
risks. The CAS program has been designed to help Lesotho sustain reforms while mitigating 
these risks. 

a) The sharp decline is SACU revenues will affect the macroeconomic framework and 
the capacity of the GOL to carry out its development agenda. The GOL will confront 
the need for substantial adjustments over the medium term which will reduce the 
preponderant role of the government. Effectively, a new development paradigm will 
need to be put in place, in which the role of the public sector is limited to the efficient 
provision of key public services and growth is generated by the private sector. This 
adjustment will necessarily take time and with general elections scheduled for 2012, 
there is a risk that the needed reforms may not be sustained. The GOL is aware of 
this risk and views the current situation as an opportunity to address long-standing 
structural weaknesses. Lesotho’s success in the past in affecting such shifts offers 
hope that this risk can be managed. The CAS, for its part, will assist the GOL by 
providing additional resources within an agreed fiscal framework, and providing key 
support in areas constraining this adjustment. Jointly with the International Monetary 
Fund and other development partners, the Bank will work with the GOL to develop 
options, ranging from fiscal consolidation and improved tax collection to greater 
mobilization of external resources, including eventually from reaching IBRD status. 
To expand the tax base, the CAS supports the GOL’s effort to penetrate new markets, 
especially regional markets, and to position Lesotho as a regional hub for FDI. 

b) The GOL’s limited capacity and weak institutions present an important risk to CAS 
implementation, while its limited capacity for political follow-through can serve to 
reduce impact. To address this risk, the Bank has aligned the CAS program with 
GOL priorities and, through program selectivity, will try to avoid overwhelming the 
GOL with too ambitious an agenda. In addition, all CAS activities focus on 
institutional strengthening and capacity building, taking account of a key conclusion 
of the CASCR. The Bank intends to continue working with development partners so 
that their jo in t and complementary efforts leave in place self-sustainable institutions 
that can carry on the sector reform agendas. 

c) Governance in Lesotho remains relatively weak, and communication between the 
Government and citizens is poor. The capacity building and institution strengthening 
efforts built into the CAS program will be complemented by assistance to improve 
dialogue between the Government and the citizenry, especially by fostering 
discussion around AAA and program designs. In particular, the envisaged AAA 
program with the Governance and Capacity Assessment at the center will provide 

32 

specific recommendations as to how to enhance the bottom up accountability. The 
Government’s initiative to improve the citizen’s voice in service delivery, the Service 
Delivery Agenda, and its commitment to engage in policy dialogue with the non-state 
actors for the preparation of the National Development Plan represent encouraging 
steps toward bottom up accountability. The coordinated AAA program will explore 
how the new tools for monitoring and evaluating public sector performance in service 
delivery could be used to enhance the dialogue between the Government and citizens. 
Through the AAA program, the Bank jointly with development partners will leverage 
new data collection and dissemination to enable citizens to more effectively 
communicate and hold their government accountable for improving public spending 
performance in delivering broad public goods. 

1 13. Any or all of the above risks can undermine the achievement of the CAS objectives. 
However, the GOL is cognizant of the changes required and, given Lesotho’s past history of 
effecting major transformations, these risks, while substantial, are manageable.

Annex 2: CAS COMPLETION REPORT 

Country: Kingdom of Lesotho 
Date of CAS: March 27 ,2006 
Date of Progress Report(s): None 
Period Covered by the CAS-CR: FY2006-2009 

I. 

Introduction 

1. 

The Completion Report for the FY06 Lesotho Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 
builds on contributions from the World Bank Country Team plus available documentation on 
projects, analytical work, and existing reviews. In addition, a Strategic Portfolio Review 
Note (2008) provided valuable insights that fed into the analysis. A 2008 management 
decision to produce a new CAS rather than prepare a CAS Progress Report meant that the 
results framework was not adjusted during implementation. 

11. 

FY06-09 CAS: Background, Design, and Relevance 

2. 
Over the 10 years prior to 2005, Lesotho underwent major economic transformations, 
and its economy grew at a rate faster than the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Garments 
went from being a nascent industry to being a major source of export earnings. The growth 
of this industry was aided in part by the 2000 African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), 
which attracted foreign direct investment (FDI) from East Asia. The mining sector attracted 
FDI in response to rising world diamond prices and became one of the drivers of economic 
growth from 2000 onward. In addition, South Africa’s investment in the Lesotho Highlands 
Water Project (LHWP) attracted large capital inflows during construction. Even if the 
project’s long-term impact on the labor and goods markets was limited, water exports have 
become an additional source of revenue for the public sector. Strengthening the domestic 
economic base to produce for export markets helped reduce reliance on remittances from 
workers in South Africa. Until the late 1980s, remittances had amounted to 50 percent of 
national income. By 2005, they had dropped to 20 percent of national income. Overall, 
manufacturing and mining became dynamic sectors; but services stagnated, and agriculture 
declined. 

3. 
At the time of the CAS design, despite these advances, Lesotho faced several major 
challenges: 

Risks to economic growth. By 2005 the stability of the international 
agreements that had been sustaining economic growth came under threat from 
(a) phasing out textile quotas under the World Trade Organization (WT0)’s 
Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC); (b) the expected removal of 
AGOA provisions on third-country fabrics; (c) the decline in Southern 
African Customs Union (SACU) revenues following trade liberalization in 
the region, and (d) the likely effect on remittances of proposed changes to 
South African legislation covering immigrants. These risks called for caution 
regarding growth prospects and for concrete actions to improve 
competitiveness to ensure alternate sources of economic growth. 

43 

Vulnerability to the HIV/AIDSpandemic. At 23 percent, in 2005 Lesotho 
posted one of the highest adult HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in the world, 
much higher than the average of SSA countries. Ineffective Government of 
Lesotho (GOL) and development partners’ HIV/AIDS prevention programs 
contributed to the high incidence level. Besides the deleterious welfare 
consequences for the victims and their families, the estimates of expected 
long-term economic losses likewise were high. In addition, high HIV/AIDS 
incidence was having a high negative impact on overall health indicators. 
Life expectancy was decreasing. 
High levels ofpover ty . The limited information available during CAS 
preparation suggested that roughly two-thirds of the country’s people were 
living below the poverty line (defined domestically). Most of these poor were 
living in rural areas. There, approximately 70 percent of the country’s 
population derived their livelihoods from working on plots of land smaller 
than one hectare (ha) with declining productivity due to environmental 
degradation. The deteriorating performance of the agricultural sector gave 
reasons for concern. 
Uneven access and quality of public services. Human development indicators 
ranked Lesotho as 149 of 177 countries. In some sectors, such as primary 
education, Lesotho outperformed most other African countries. In other 
sectors, the country lagged them. This lag raised serious concerns about the 
effectiveness of public expenditure, especially when Lesotho’s level of public 
expenditure equaled approximately 50 percent of its GDP.25 
4. which they proposed ways to address these challenges. The authorities involved most of the 
In 2005 the Lesotho authorities drafted a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 
country’s key stakeholders and communities in the preparation of the strategy, which the 
government organized around three main pillars: 

a. Employment and income generation through higher economic growth 
b. Sharing the benefits of growth: health, education, and the environment 
c . Improving governance and public service delivery. 

The PRSP also identified three cross-cutting issues: HIV/AIDS, gender, and children and 
youth. In September 2005, the IMF’s and the Bank’s Executive Boards endorsed the PRSP. 

5 . 

The CAS aligned its strategic objectives with those of the three PRSP pillars and built 
the program of support around the perceived comparative advantage of the World Bank in 
Lesotho: “analytical strength and convening powers, combined with development finance 
and its ability to leverage other partners.”26 The resulting CAS was grounded on four 
strategic objectives: 

a. Fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic 
b. Establish sustainable pro-poor growth and j o b creation 

25 Lesotho receives the bulk of its public revenues f iom revenue-sharing of customs collections within 
SACU. South Afiica collects and distributes the shares. Lowering external customs fees and duties within 
SACU affects Lesotho’s fiscal position. 
26 Country Assistance Strategy for the Kingdom of Lesotho, March 27 ,2006 . 

44 

c. Improve human development outcomes 
d . Strengthen decentralization, service delivery, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). 

As can be seen, the CAS followed the architecture of the PRSP but, to highlight the urgency 
of facing up to the epidemic, elevated the HIV/AIDS efforts from a crosscutting theme to a 
strategic objective. 

6. 

The bulk of the results framework proposed by the CAS and summarized in a Results 
Matrix27 relied on the contributions of then-active operations, which covered HIV/AIDS, 
health, education, infrastructure (water and electricity), and the environment. Table A 1 
presents the operations that were active at the time of the CAS preparation. 

7 . 
The proposed new operations under the CAS focused on development themes that 
had received less attention in the past, specifically: (a) economic growth and (b) management 
of public resources. Given the challenges that Lesotho faced and the authorities’ emerging 
priorities, the shift in focus, particularly the emphasis on economic growth and 
competitiveness, was both timely and relevant. However, no major impact was expected 
during the CAS period because it was foreseen that getting the new programs off the ground 
would take the country and the development partners beyond the CAS timeframe. 

8 . 
The proposed analytic work under the CAS was consistent with emphasizing 
economic growth and diversification, improving management of public resources, and 
reducing poverty. However, due to the absence of supporting analytical work, the CAS did 
not provide an adequate roadmap of how the Bank’s program could help reduce poverty in 
the country. Some of the analytical work needed to spell out a shared growth strategy was 
subsequently prepared during the CAS period. With hindsight, the 2005 CAS program was 
relevant to the strategy of the country and responded to emerging concerns, but its design was 
affected by the limited analytical work available at the time. 

9. 
The CAS emphasized flexibility in program implementation, building the country’s 
implementation capacity, harmonizing development partners, and improving M&E. Again, 
the CAS was scarce in details on how these principles would be implemented. The CAS 
could have spelled out with more precision the proposed approach to capacity building, and 
M&E, or could have proposed a roadmap to strengthen donor coordination. 

27 The partners did not modify the results matrix during implementation. 

45 

111. 

Progress toward Development Goals 

10. 
Lesotho posted mixed progress toward the PRSP goals. On the positive side, the rate 
of economic growth exceeded expectations. Between 2006 and 2008, the average rate of 
economic growth was 4.5 percent. The CAS had foreseen an average rate of 3.0 percent, 
which turned out to be unduly pessimistic.28 Lesotho’s exports (garments and diamonds) and 
large SACU transfers were the main contributors to the recent spurt in economic growth until 
the global economic crisis hit Lesotho hard in 2 0 0 8 4 9 . 

11. 
The 2008 global crisis affected the country through several channels.29 As a result, 
GDP growth was expected to be only 0.9 percent in 2009. After rising sharply from 25 
percent of GDP in 2004-05 to approximately 40 percent of GDP in 2006-07, SACU 
revenues fell somewhat to 37 percent of GDP in 2008-09. They are expected to decline 
sharply to approximately 14 percent of GDP in 2010-1 1. This steep decline in SACU 
revenues is expected to translate into deteriorations in both the fiscal and the current account 
balances. 

12. 
Access to primary education improved significantly, and universal primary education 
and gender parity are within reach in Lesotho. However, as is typical in many developing 
countries, educational quality is now the main concern, along with the provision of secondary 
education as the number of graduates of primary education increases. Tracking progress in 
the quality of education is difficult because a monitoring system is not in place and 
information is weak and sporadic. Tracking the impact of economic growth on poverty with 
certainty is impossible at this time. The last comprehensive information on poverty levels 
came from the 2002-03 Household Budget Survey (HBS) and the 2004 Demographic and 
Health Survey (DHS). The information available suggests that in 2002-03 roughly half of 
the population lived below the national poverty line; poverty remains 50 percent higher in 
rural areas than in urban areas; and inequality in Lesotho is very high.30 The country’s 
HIV/AIDS rate remains among the highest in Africa, with limited progress achieved only 
recently, as described below. The likelihood of meeting the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) overall is mixed. 

1.3. 
Lesotho’s governance indicators consistently are far above the SSA average and, 
recent progress in the governance rankings has been relatively limited.31 More importantly, 
Lesotho and Swaziland rank lower on governance than their neighbors: Botswana, Mauritius, 
Namibia, and South Africa. Lesotho’s lower ranking represents a disadvantage as the 

28 Estimates of the annual rate of economic growth stand between 5%-6%. 
It was expected by the Bank 
that (1) mining would continue to lead growth; ( 2 ) performance of manufacturing would depend on 
improving the business environment; and (3) the recovery of agriculture after the 2007 drought would 
contribute to economic growth. 
29 The main channels of crisis impact are (1) economic slowdown in the United States (Lesotho’s main 
export destination for garments) has hurt Lesotho’s textiles industry leading to j o b losses; ( 2 ) slump in 
diamond prices and the global credit crunch have resulted in reduced production and export of diamonds; 
(3) slowdown in the South African economy has led to a sharp decline in its imports and, as a result, 
significant decline in SACU revenues; and (4) large-scale j o b losses have occurred in the mining sector, in 
which Basotho are employed. 
30 It is likely that, in Lesotho, the limited impact of high aggregate economic growth on reducing poverty 
and improving social indicators is related to the high level of inequality.

country competes for investment within a common economic space. The country ranks 
particularly low in regulatory quality (business environment). Its highest rankings (over 50 
percent) come in control of corruption, voice, and accountability. 

14. 
Political stability also is a concern a s evidenced by the highly contested elections of 
February 2007, divided political support (rural support to the ruling party and urban support 
for the opposition), and continuous splits of the political parties.

This section of the CASCR takes stock of the results contributed by the World 
Bank’s program under the CAS. To the extent possible, the section examines the 
contribution of the program and its results toward reaching the country’s long-term 
development objectives. For ease of presentation, table 1 presents a summary of progress 
against the key result indicators, which are analyzed in the remainder of this section pillar by 
pillar. A matrix in the appendix presents achievements against expected results in more 
detail (table A7).

16. 
Prioritizing the work on HIV/AIDS under the CAS was highly relevant. Had such 
high levels of incidence gone unattended, the welfare and economic costs could have 
escalated rapidly. The major concern was the low pace of implementation of the 
government’s and development partners’ initiatives. To address this concern, the Bank 
defined its role as helping the (a) National AIDS Commission (NAC) to implement the 
GOL’s program and (b) GOL to mobilize resources from the Global Fund and other 
development partners. To achieve these objectives, the Bank relied on its ongoing 
HIV/AIDS Capacity Building Project, patterned after the Bank Multi-Country HIV/AIDS 
Program under implementation in Africa. Consequently, the $5 million IDA grant focused 
on improving the implementation capacity at the Ministries of Finance and Development 
Planning, and Health and Social Welfare; and a t the Secretariat of the National AIDS 

47 

Program. In addition, the grant targeted working with civil society and the private sector to 
raise awareness and enhance the national implementation capacity. 

17. 
The IDA grant succeeded in meeting all of the project development objective 
indicators. The capacity to implement and utilize resources under the Global Fund for AIDS, 
TB and Malaria (GFATM) and assess the impact of resources for the national response 
substantially increased for both governmental and non-governmental institutions. The 
project disbursed 94 percent (US$32.25 million) of the Round 2 GFATM Grants by 
December 3 1 , 2008, easily surpassing the 80 percent target. The project contributed to a 
sharp turnaround in the Global Fund portfolio from poor performance to very good 
performance. In addition, Bank assistance has contributed directly and indirectly to the (a) 
design and approval of a National HIV/AIDS strategy, (b) communication and training of 
youth (approximately 490,000 of young people out of school underwent life skills education; 
number of condoms distributed to youth corners and general population increased 220 times), 
and (c) advancing testing and retroviral treatment. 

18. 
As a result, the pace of implementation of the HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan is picking up. 
By the end of the project, the number of sites with functional Voluntary Counseling and 
Testing (VCT) centers reached 102 sites, almost doubling the project target of 5 5 sites and 50 
percent of these sites are fully equipped. The antiretroviral (ARV) program was established. 
The number of people receiving ARV treatment reached approximately 23,000, exceeding 
the project target of 20,000. As to the impact of these efforts on the development objectives 
of the country, the escalation of the epidemic appears contained. Nevertheless, the 
magnitude of the problem is such that major gaps remain in both prevention and mitigation. 
Thus, adult HIV prevalence remains stagnant: 2005 and 2007 surveillance data showed no 
major differences in incidence among women attending antenatal clinics. On the positive 
side, incidence among youth (ages 15-24) fell from 11 percent in 2005 to 8.9 percent in 
2007. Regretfully, female incidence at 14.9 percent far exceeded male incidence at 5.9 
percent. By the end of 2009, only 40 percent of eligible patients had been covered with 
advance testing and retroviral treatment. 

19. 
The limited impact of the project and the overall development partner support on 
prevalence is understandable given the time it took to speed up implementation. However, 
other factors may be at work. The GOL and development partners should pay greater 
attention to investigating the determinants of the epidemic through, if possible, joint 
analytical work. Lessons that have emerged from assessments of past donor support include 
avoiding unrealistic and over-ambitious project designs, ensuring that the institutions needed 
to implement them are in place, and working continuously at capacity building. In August 
2009, the Bank approved a follow-up project that continues to focus on helping to (a) draw 
on international f i n d s that are available to fight HIV/AIDS and (b) improve coordination and 
implementation capacity. At this time, the ICR for the previous project is available. The 
challenge for the new project will be to go beyond the previous efforts and seek impact on 
the ground through the development and implementation of a good monitoring system that 
would track changes of behavior in the population consistent with a future reduction in 
HIV/AID S incidence.

Under the second pillar, Bank assistance sought to help Lesotho develop new areas of 
economic growth and employment opportunities. The CAS foresaw three results clusters 
under this pillar. The first cluster centered on creating an enabling environment for private 
sector development (foreign and domestic). The second cluster combined emphasis on 
increasing access to good infrastructure and rural development. The third cluster concerned 
the sustainable use of natural resources. As already has been mentioned, the Bank had not 
been engaged in working on diversification directly, and no major breakthroughs were 
expected. The main emphasis was on setting a good institutional foundation for 
diversification in the future. 

Improving the Business Environment 

21. 
To improve the business environment, the Bank aligned its support with GOL's 
ongoing efforts to reduce behind-the-border constraints. The main instruments have been (a) 
the Private Sector Competiveness and Economic Diversification Project (PSCEDP), FY07- 
12 and (b) the PRSC series. PRSC I was approved in FY08 and PRSC I1 was approved in 
FY 10. Analytical work including an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and a Private 

49 

Sector Development Strategy3* has informed the program design and provided underpinning 
for policy dialogue. A second ICA is under preparation. In addition, at the request of the 
government, the Bank prepared a series of Policy Notes, on various issues including an 
examination of the conditions for attracting FDI and diversifying the sources of growth. 
These notes were discussed with the Cabinet in July 2009.33 

22. 
The implementation of the PSCEDP was mixed. The project has been downgraded to 
moderately satisfactory mainly because of the delayed process of finalizing and adopting the 
Companies Bill and the newly separated Business Reporting Bill and Industrial Licensing 
Bill. A draft Companies Bill has been approved by the Attorney General for submission to 
Cabinet and is targeted for adoption by June 2010. Adoption of the new Companies Act 
would reduce the time taken to register a business to fewer than 28 days as of December 
2009. Likewise, the PSCEDP is supporting drafting new legislation on industrial licensing. 
The new legislation is expected to be adopted and implemented in 2010. When it is, it will 
significantly reduce the administrative burden and cost of obtaining industrial licenses in 
Lesotho. The Ministry of Trade, Industry, Cooperatives and Marketing (MTICM) in 
collaboration with Private Sector Development Division (PSDD) of the Ministry of Finance 
and Development Planning and PSCEDP are amending the Trading Enterprise Regulation of 
1999. The amendments could gain Lesotho 4 places in the World Bank’s 201 1 competitive 
ranking in addition to gaining an additional 4 places through the new Companies Act. 
23. 
A key achievement of the PSCEDP has been strengthening the dialogue with the 
GOL around financial and private sector development; and increasing coordination among 
the development partners. The Bank has been working closely with DfID in supporting the 
One-stop Business Facilitation Centre (OBFC) 34 under the Ministry of Industry. The 
PSCEDP has supported the development of a strategic plan for the OBFC and is expected to 
support the implementation of the OBFC strategic plan after DfI D support expired in 2009. 
The PSCEDP is also focusing on consolidating the gains made through DfID support by 

3 2 Other analytical work included a Program to Reform the Company Registry and Licensing Regime, as 
well as a study on skills requirements for productivity and growth, a program to reform the immigration 
and customs services, and the value chain analysis for strategic sectors. 
33 The one-day seminar with the Cabinet, titled “Reshaping Lesotho’s Position in SACU to Meet the 
Challenges of Sustained and Shared Growth,” considered four issues: (a) Fiscal Challenges and Options for 
Reform; (b) Effective Use of Public Resources, Particularly for Capital Expenditure Supporting Growth, 
(3) Agriculture: Challenges and Directions for Agribusiness; and (4) Realizing FDI to Diversify Lesotho’s 
Expo r t s . 
34 The One Stop Business Facilitation Centre (OBFC), previously called One Stop Shop (OSS), established 
by MITCM is operational to facilitate issuance of manufacturing and trading licenses and process import 
permits and export visas. OBFC manages issuing export permits, import permits, business registration and 
licenses, and work permits. OBFC also provides application forms for residence permits for investors (the 
actual processing is still done at Ministry of Home Affairs and Public Safety, or MHAPS). Since its 
inception in 2007, OBFC has issued 692 export visas and 8 5 7 import permits. Average time taken to 
process import permits has dropped fiom 4 days to 1.9 days. Time taken to process export visas has 
dropped fiom 2-3 days to 5-6 hours. OBFC also has issued more than 5,000 business licenses through a 
slightly simplified administrative process. Additional opportunities exist to streamline processes by 
adopting new legislation and simpler procedures. The OBFC Steering Committee has approved the 
appointment of a director for OBFC under MITCM-a 
key step to strengthen institutional capacity. 

50 

building an effective OBFC and by drafting legislation, as already noted, to achieve the CAS 
objectives under the business e n ~ i r o nm e n t . ~ ? 

24. 
In addition, satisfactory work is underway to increase the transparency of the 
allocation of licenses, especially for tourism. The Ministry of Tourism has adopted a 
Concessions Manual, which sets out transparent procedures for concessioning tourism sites. 
A Task Force has been established under the Lesotho Tourism Development Corporation to 
concession a pilot tourism site with the support of technical assistance (TA) provided under 
the PSC Project. An information package had been prepared, and the concession process is 
expected to be completed by May 2010. 

25. 
Concerning the impact of all of these efforts on long-term development objectives, at 
130 in the 2010 Doing Business Database, Lesotho ranks the lowest among countries in the 
Southern Africa region. The other countries are South Africa (32), Botswana (38), Namibia 
(5 l ) , and Swaziland (108). The 2010 Doing Business Database continues to rank Lesotho 
low at 130 of 183 countries, because the efforts underway, including the legislative 
initiatives, have not been finalized. Nevertheless, the agenda under implementation is on 
track and likely will improve the business environment and the institutional effectiveness of 
OBFC through support for the implementation of the new Companies Act. The Act will 
strengthen OBFC and focus on the delivery of quick wins in registration and licensing 
requirements. The institutional strengthening includes the creation of the Private Sector 
Development Division (PSDD in the Ministry of Finance and Development with support 
from DfID. Finally, work under the project has helped identify constraints such as the lack of 
built factory space to support the growth of the manufacturing sector. Through the PSCEDP, 
the World Bank has initiated dialogue with the GOL to provide support for the Lesotho 
National Development Corporation (LNDC) to develop and manage industrial facilities and 
possibly restructure the LNDC. 

26. 
The challenge ahead is great. With public expenditure at 70 percent of GDP in 
2009/10, the GOL has limited capacity to design and advance strategies for growth and 
diversification through public spending. Therefore, the challenge continues to be to improve 
the private business environment and promote domestic entrepreneurship. Given the size of 
the GOL expenditure, many of the government?s activities impinge on or otherwise 
negatively affect investment opportunities. Addressing the most critical reforms requires (a) 
a strong capacity at the central government level to design and coordinate reform, because 
today all of the initiatives are dispersed; and (b) interest and commitment in each agency to 
carry out the necessary reforms. Only thus will GOL be able to deliver on its commitment to 
open space for the private sector. Unfortunately, the domestic private sector?s weak capacity 
to organize itself means that it cannot be an effective counterpart in identifying constraints 
and proposing and implementing solutions. 

?? The needed legislation covers a wide range of areas-registration and reportinghndustrial licensing. The 
approval and implementation of this legislation is expected in 2010. Work is underway to simplify the visa 
requirements to enter and to work in Lesotho and the issuance of a National Identification Card. In 
addition, the Ministry of Tourism adopted a concessions manual, which sets out transparent procedures to 
assign concessions in tourist sites. 

51 

Improving Inpastructure Services 

27. 
For some years, the Bank has been working on improving the investment climate 
through better infrastructure. The 2005 CAS continued this support through 2 ongoing 
operations: (a) Phase 1 of the Water Sector Improvement Project Adaptable Program Loan 
(APL) (WS IP l ) and (b) the Lesotho Utilities Reform Project (LURP.) The strategy was that a 
new initiative-the 
Integrated Transport Project (ITP), to be co-financed with the EU- 
would support institutional reforms in the transport sector. Second, and quite importantly, 
the project would also finance rural roads as a key strategic move to link isolated rural areas 
to the market. PRSC support for decentralization focused likewise on improving service 
delivery. The Bank’s assistance in infrastructure has been and continues to be highly 
relevant to creating a competitive investment platform in the sliver of land at the foot of the 
mountains that surrounds the capital city (Maseru). The transport project also is relevant to 
the connection of Lesotho’s rural areas to the main markets and the connection through the 
mountains of the main industries around the capital city to the port of Durban in South 
Africa. 

28. 
Water. The long history of World Bank support for the water sector began in the late 
1970s with water supply to seven small towns.36 This history continued with the Bank’s 
involvement in the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP), which supported the 
implementation of the engineering studies in 1986. The first Bank project, approved in 199 1 , 
was to support Phase 1 of the LHWP, a massive investment to build dam and transmission 
infrastructure to export water from the water-rich Lesotho Highlands to Gauteng Province of 
South Africa. Although it financed only 4 percent of the total investment, the Bank played a 
central role in the completion of the project.37 The Bank also financed similar assistance 
through Phase 1B of the LHWP, approved in 1998, which included studies to investigate 
potential sources of water supply to the Lesotho Lowlands. 

29. 
Afterwards, WS IP l , approved in 2004, focused on improving domestic supply in 
Maseru and supported WASA, the public water company, to improve management practices. 
By all accounts, WASA’s improvement has been a success story. Among other 
achievements, WASA has lowered the number of customers who receive fewer than 18 
hours’ supply, reduced the percentage of biological samples failing testing, reduced 
unaccounted-for water, and increased the collection of water bills (to 96 percent.) WSIP 1 
also has contributed to implement the institutional reforms outlined in the 1999 Water 
Resource Management Strategy, in particular, the establishment of the office of the 
Commissioner of Water (Cow ) . One of the COW’S key outputs has been to draft the Water 
Resource Bill, passed in December, 2008, which provides a comprehensive legal framework 
for the sector. 

36 

The World Bank’s involvement in the water sector began in the late 1970s with support for the 
construction of piped water systems in 7 small towns to serve approximately 50,000 inhabitants. This 
construction was complemented by measures to strengthen the Water and Sewerage Branch, which 
ultimately became WASA. 
37 The Bank project that supported this initiative closed in 2007. The team’s ICR rated the project as 
satisfactory on both outcomes and Bank performance. IEG concurred on Bank performance but rated the 
outcomes as moderately satisfactory. 

52 

30. 
Regarding long-term development goals, the evidence is that, regarding quantity, 
Lesotho’s water service coverage has remained at approximately 80 percent of the population 
for the last 5 years. However, the quality of the services has improved. Indeed, of 24 
African countries sampled between 1995 and 2005, Lesotho ranks third in moving 
populations away from surface water to higher levels of service. The country’s annual gain 
in piped water has been approximately 2 .7 percent over the last decade. As the population in 
the Lowlands increases through immigration, the challenge will be to provide these new 
residents with adequate services. This challenge is being addressed in part through Phase 2 
of the WSIP (WSIP2), approved by the Board of Directors in May 2009. This is part of a 
multidonor program of support to the GOL’s Metolong Dam and Water Supply Program 
(MDWSP). The MDWSP finances construction of the Metolong Dam; a water treatment 
plant; and downstream conveyance to the Maseru and the surrounding towns of Roma, 
Morija, Mazenod, and Teyateyaneng. The MDWSP will provide 75,000 m3 per day of 
additional treated water to the region. 

3 1 . 
Lesotho’s experience in the water sector yields valuable lessons. First, the good 
results achieved at WASA follow from the use of targeted incentives and innovative 
management tools. The use of incentives was combined with an independent performance 
audit function, requirement to publish results, and dual oversight agreement. The approach 
has not only produced results but also built confidence, developed leadership skills, and 
raised awareness among decision makers of the efforts and inputs needed to improve public 
utility performance. Most important, the improvements at WASA were internally driven by 
dynamic management with the support of government stakeholders. These changes could not 
have been achieved through the support of the World Bank project alone. This experience 
highlights the importance of government-driven and donor-supported initiatives. 

32. 
Electricity and telecommunications. The Lesotho Utility Reform Project (LURP) 
(FYO 1) focused on improving service delivery in electricity and telecommunications. It 
sought to help to consolidate the privatization of the Lesotho Telecommunications 
Corporation (LTC). It also sought to privatize the Lesotho Electricity Corporation (LEC). In 
both sectors, it fostered the introduction of regulatory institutions. 

33. 
The strategy to improve the delivery of electricity was, first, to engage a private 
operator through a management contract and then to privatize. However, in 2003 the GOL 
decided against an outright sale.38 The existing management contract continued until 
December 2006.39 It yielded major improvements in the quality of the service and the 
finances of the company.40 Many of these achievements took place during this CAS period. 
From 2001 to 2007, the number of customers doubled-to 
approximately 55,000. Bill 
collection stands at approximately 100 percent. The percentage of electricity losses dropped 
from 35 percent to 11 percent. The electrification rate rose from 1 percent in 2001 to 18 
percent at the end of 2009. 

381n the meantime, however, Lesotho continued to issue a concession. 
39 The management contract was extended continuously for brief periods-an 
uncertainty. 
40 The original project did not include investment funds as the funds were to be provided by the private 
concessionaire. The project was not reprogrammed to provide these funds. Fortunately, resources 
generated internally financed an effective investment and expansion program. Still, the Bank and the 
AfDB funded approximately 1 1,000 connections, slightly above 50% of the 20,000 connections that LEC 
had built. 

approach that created undue 

53 

34. 
After the management contract ended in 2006 and LEC’s concession failed, the GOL 
hired individual managers and appointed a managing director in 2007. The development 
partners have highlighted the risks that this strategy introduces to the achievement of 
national commitments, such as reaching 35 percent nationwide electricity coverage by 201 5. 
The partners have called on the GOL to hold the new managers to the same standards of 
accountability as it did the management company. Given the critical importance that the 
electricity sector plays in the country’s economic growth strategy, it is important for the 
partners to address the concerns about the sustainability of the reform efforts.41 In hindsight, 
the Bank could have moved faster to accept the shifting attitude toward privatization of 
utilities, in which Lesotho’s position mimics the position of other countries in the region. 

35. 
Transportation. Lesotho has faced the challenge of improving and maintaining the 
road network, particularly the connection o f isolated rural markets. A previous Bank 
operation42 developed the conceptual groundwork, tested the options, and drew the lessons 
that underpinned the design of the Integrated Transport Project (ITP) (FY07) relevant to this 
CAS. ITP objectives include (a) improving transport sector institutions, (b) connecting 
isolated (mountainous) areas to services and market opportunities, and (c) mainstreaming the 
fight against HIV throughout the project components. The project is on target to deliver the 
results set by the CAS, but it is too early to report definite outcomes.43 Contracts for civil 
works aimed a t reducing the travel time to markets and social services have been awarded, 
and the work has commenced. All civil works contracts include clauses calling for actions 
to increase workers’ awareness of HIV/AIDS prevention methods. 

36. 
With the creation in 2005 of an independent Roads Directorate (RD) in the Ministry 
of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), institutional reform of the road sector is underway. 
The Roads Directorate operates on commercial principles and is a proxy o f the Road 
Authority but with its own board. The Roads Directorate is in the final stages of becoming 
fully staffed. All indications are that, when h l l y operational, it will catapult Lesotho road 
sector management from a traditional departmental and politicized entity to one of technical 
excellence. The long-term benefit to the Lesotho economy is that the professional approach 
and technical and resource-based planning for the network-including prioritization of 
maintenance, rehabilitation, and development of the network-will 
result in optimal use of 
available resources at any time. A less pronounced but gradual improvement is found in the 
Road Fund functions. The government is increasing the user fees for the Road Fund, which 
are used to finance routine and periodic maintenance of the road network. Coverage of 
maintenance by user fees is up from 50 percent to approximately 72 percent. 

4 1 Other concerns include (a) weakening the regulator by removing an independent source of finance; (b) 
weakening monitoring and reporting (previously done by the concessionaire); and (c) closing the 
Privatization Unit, which held valuable experience in managing IDA and AfDB projects. 
42 Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP). 
Results on the ground will come in the next CAS . However, due to escalation of costs, additional 
financing will be required to complete the works that already have been programmed.

54 

Sustainable Development 

37 . 
The majority of the population and the poor live in the highlands. Given the limited 
arable land in a fragile environment, the strategy for sustainable development centers on 
enabling local communities and authorities to better manage their natural assets. Through the 
Maloti-Dakensberg Trans-frontier Project (MDTP), the Bank supported efforts in targeted 
areas to develop and test mechanisms to empower communities to manage their 
environmental assets. The CAS had foreseen an additional operation to support the 
environment financed with regional GEF funds. However, that funding went to a different 
program. 

3 8 . 
The MDTP closed in December 2009. It met its development objectives: (a) 
community-based planning principles were adopted to facilitate management of natural 
resources in the areas supported by the project; and (b) good cooperation between South 
Africa and Lesotho helped to address threats to biodiversity and conservation such as fires. 
In addition, the MDTP contributed to the development o f the 20-year bio-regional trans- 
frontier conservation strategy, development of the tourist strategy, and conservation measures 
for threatened species. The current challenge is to work on the sustainability o f these 
initiatives and expand achievements beyond the targeted areas under the project. Much 
hinges on the success of the decentralization strategy and the effective empowerment of the 
local communities to manage their natural resources.

As mentioned, Lesotho’s challenge was to deliver better outcomes in education and 
health. In primary school education, Lesotho ranked high among SSA countries in access, 
but quality was a concern. On the other hand, low enrollments in secondary and tertiary 
education did not bode well for an economy aspiring to compete and grow into middle- 
income status. The health of the population appeared to have declined over the previous 

5 5 

decade. Morbidity and mortality from communicable deceases had increased, a problem 
made even more critical by the high incidence of HIV/AIDS. 

Health 

40. 
Bank support for health came through the Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP) 
Phase I1 (FY06) operating as a sector-wide approach (SWAP) agreement with other 
development partners. The five triggers for moving to Phase I11 of the APL have been 
Nevertheless, performance of the 15 key indicators tracked by GOL and partners under the 
SWAP is mixed. Based on the original design, Phase I11 would have provided support 
mainly to the national referral hospital, which already has been supported by the public- 
private partnership (PPP). Thus, it is planned that a Health Sector Results-based Financing 
Project, instead of Phase I11 of HSRP, will be prepared. 

41. With the support of the CAS program, major achievements include (a) improved 
capacity for service delivery a t the district level; (b) higher immunization rates; (c) improved 
access to essential health services, that is, antenatal care and preventing mother-to-child 
transmission (PMTCT); (d) increased HIV testing coverage and TB detention rates; and (e) 
improved M&E and fiduciary capacity.45 Despite the work and progress in putting in place 
new institutional arrangements that emphasize local responsibility for health services, the full 
impact on the ground has yet to come. Lesotho remains behind in reaching the MDG 
targets-with 
low life expectancy, high child mortality, and the third highest adult HIV 
prevalence in the world. 

42. 
As with HIV/AIDS, the achievement of development outcomes such as moving 
closer to MDG targets and reversing declining trends will depend on removing capacity 
constraints. For instance, the shortage of health professionals is severe. The country needs to 
develop a medium-term plan rather than rely on stop-gap measures-ften 
under the advice 
of development partners to produce immediate results. The decentralization of health 
services, a basic pillar of the reform design, h r t h e r illustrates how capacity limitations hinder 
delivery of outcomes. Three years after decentralization commenced, the District Health 
Management Teams are not yet fully operational. Transferring responsibility for delivery to 
the district level requires very intensive coordination (planning, implementing agencies, 
budgeting). Such coordination does not happen by itself, and health authorities currently are 
not able to implement it by themselves. In addition, the lack of health professionals is even 
more severe a t the local level than at the center. The Bank, under the GPOBA grant, and IFC 

44 The 5 triggers are (a) the District Health Management Teams have their own budgets and authority to 
incur expenditure; (b) the TB program has been strengthened. The latest data (2008-09) indicated a 
treatment success rate of 67%, somewhat lower than in 2006 (73%); (c) the PPP contract for the new 
national referral hospital achieved financial closing; (d) disbursement stands at more than 90%; and (e) 
formulation of the national health fmancing policy is in progress. 
45 In greater detail, progress under the project includes (a) District Health Management Teams (DHMT) 
have been established in 10 districts and provided with equipment and in-service training; (b) a five-year 
Emergency Human Resources Plan has been developed and aims at fast-track recruitment of the resources 
needed to effectively deliver health services; (c) the PPP to replace the National Referral Hospital Queen 
Elizabeth I1 is on track; (d) key studies on how best to allocate resources to districts has been completed; 
(e) the MOHSW has undertaken a functional review of its administrative structure; and ( f ) procurement of 
incineration equipment and incinerator repairs to properly manage medical waste has been completed.

are helping GOL to put in place a PPP to build and operate Lesotho’s National Referral 
Hospital, which serves the bulk of the Basotho population. 

Education 

43. 
As stated in Vision 2020, the overall aim for education in Lesotho is to develop and 
implement “education policies which ensure the acquisition of functional literacy among all 
Basotho and the development of a productive, quality human resource base through 
education and training.” 

44. 
The Bank has provided support for the country’s education efforts since 1975. 
Significant progress has taken place, especially with regard to basic education. Free primary 
education was introduced in 2000. Progress in access and retention led to gross and net 
enrollment rates of 1 18 percent and 82 percent, respectively, in 2008. Completion rate for 
the same year was 93 percent. Gender parity has been achieved, and Lesotho is expected to 
reach the MDGs for education on time. Bank support during the CAS period came through 
an IDA operation-the Education Sector Development Project (ESDP) Phase 11-and 
two 
sequential grants from the EFA Fast Track Initiative (FTI) Catalytic Fund. 

45. 
The outputs of these interventions are visible in the (a) construction and renovation of 
classrooms and a new campus for the Lesotho College of Education in the mountainous area 
of Thaba-Tseka; (b) provision of primary school textbooks and learning materials; (c) 
increased number of teachers including qualified teachers; and (d) introduction of a distance 
education teacher training program.46 The proportion of the total education recurrent budget 
devoted to primary education increased from 57 percent in 2004 to 64 percent in 2008-09. 
The share of budget allocation to education was 22 percent in 2008. However, important 
challenges are still to be faced. Repetition is very high, especially in first grades (29 percent 
repetition rate in grade 1). More than half of the school infrastructure for primary education 
(52 percent) does not meet basic standards. Forty-two percent of the teaching staff is 
unqualified. Enrollment in post-basic education in general is still low (42 percent gross 
enrollment rate for secondary education), and there are questions about the quality of basic 
education. 

46. 
Bank assistance has been hampered by the limited capacity in the Ministry of 
Education and Training (MoET). To support implementation of ESDP Phase 11, a Project 
Support and Coordination Unit (PSCU) was established with project and counterpart funds. 
This unit grew substantially over time. It became a parallel structure to MoET, on which it 
depended not only for project implementation but also for M&E, overall procurement, and 
financial management. This unit was dismantled in December 2008. Since then, MoET has 
been going through a transition aimed at creating in-house capacity. As stated in the ICR, in 
2008 MoET’s capacity was diminished by the closure of the project, resulting in the loss of 

46 In greater detail, 38 new primary schools were constructed under the ESDP 11; 29 schools were 
reconstructed or extended under the FTI funds. However, a significant number of pupils remain in 
temporary structures and overcrowded conditions. In 2007 FTI funds helped provide 389,000 books for 
core subjects (English, Sesotho, mathematics, and science). The number of teachers has increased to over 
10,000, reducing the average pupil: teacher ratio to 41. The number of unqualified teachers has stabilized 
at approximately 41 percent. The Distant Teacher Education program produced its first 450 graduates in 
2006. 

57 

most of the PSCU personnel. In 2007 the MoET began to create public service posts to 
replace some of the tasks, and many of the PSCU staff was absorbed. However, there were 
significant losses of expertise in financial management, procurement, and supervision of 
construction. 

47. 
Resistance to reform in post-basic education was another factor that hampered Bank 
support. ESDP I1 was expected to advance the reform agenda in post-basic education, but 
both internal and external resistance prevented it from moving forward. The lack of progress 
has important consequences. Current post-basic education is both inefficient and quite 
costly. The expenditure line for the bursaries scheme is approximately 35 percent of the 
overall education budget. 

48. 
Donor coordination in Lesotho has been very successful in the education sector. The 
local education donor group has supported the preparation of the Education Sector Strategy 
2005-2015, and its update, the Education Sector Medium Term Plan 2009-2012. Both have 
been endorsed by the donor group and the FTI partnership. Three applications for grants 
from the FTI Catalytic Fund were submitted and succeeded. Annual jo in t technical reviews 
take place regularly, and joint supervision has taken place regarding the implementation of 
the FTI grants. Irish Aid is the lead donor. 

49. 

Looking forward, education in Lesotho faces three major challenges: 

a. Improve the quality of primary education to complement the significant gains in 
access. 
b. Improve access to secondary education. As primary completion rates improve, larger 
cohorts move into secondary education, in which fees and lack of infrastructure 
(buildings, teaching materials, qualified teachers) limit access, especially by the poor. 
c. Increase the relevance of tertiary education and its ability to support growth. To date, 
the sizable allocation of public resources has not been followed by the emergence of 
qualified graduates.

Under the fourth pillar, the CAS foresaw support for GOL’s commitment to involve 
local communities in their own development, following on the election of district and local 
councils for the first time in 2005. 47 These elections proved that the GOL was committed to 
decentralization. It follows that attention to decentralization was highly relevant for two 
reasons. It was a priority for GOL, and effective decentralization was important to achieve 
various objectives of the strategy, including in health and environment. However, the Bank 
had not previously worked to develop the capacity of local governments. Of the other 
development partners, only Gessellschaft h r Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) had. 

5 1. 
The Bank’s strategy was to accompany decentralization through a PRSC series, while 
strengthening the capacity of the GOL to manage public resources. The latter also was an 
area in which the Bank had had limited engagement. However, other development partners 
such as UNDP and DfID had been engaged in this area. 

‘ 52. 
The Bank’s Board approved the first (of three) PRSC operations for Lesotho in May 
2008 and the second on March 30 ,2010 . The PRSC I operation covered three themes: (a) 
creating a conductive environment for private sector growth, (b) improving the public 
expenditure management and fiduciary framework, and (c) improving access to basic 
services through decentralization and empowerment of communities. Work under the last 
two themes supports this pillar. Although GOL has made significant progress in 
implementing its reform program supported through PRSC I, the approval of only the first 
operation and preparation of the second during this CAS means that outcomes under the 
program will not manifest until the new Country Assistance Strategy. 

53. 
Most recently, the PRSC has successh l ly promoted the adoption of better budgeting 
practices.. They include the adoption of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), 
and as an integral part of MTEF development, the annual preparation of a Medium Term 
Fiscal Framework (MTFF). On April 1 , 2009, a new Integrated Financial Management 
Information System (IFMIS) became operational. All ministries now prepare their MTEF 
budgets by using the budget module of the IFMIS, the new chart of accounts, and the new 
budget classification system. Individual ministries also prepare Budget Framework Papers 
(BFPs), which set ou t their visions, objectives, proposed revisions to their programs, and 
proposed changes to their pattern of resource use. 

54 . 
Six pilot ministries prepare MTEF information on a program basis. In 2007 Lesotho 
revised its Public Procurement Regulations to align them with international practices. The 
new procurement system is decentralized and supported by a Procurement Policy and 
Advisory Division. A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) identified areas in 
which some fine-tuning will improve and clarify the design of the procurement system during 
the PRSC implementation. Amendments to the Public Procurement Regulations have been 
drafted; however, their finalization is awaiting passage of the revised PFM Act. To provide 
an appeal mechanism, instead of the proposed establishment of an Independent Procurement 
Regulatory Authority (IPRA), the GOL is establishing a Procurement Tribunal. 

47 Note that the title of this pillar differs between the main text and the results matrix found as an appendix 
in the CAS . The title in the main text is “Decentralization, Service Delivery, and Monitoring and 
Evaluation.” 

59 

55. 
On decentralization, the most notable result was the enactment into law of the Local 
Government Service Bill, which is highly relevant. Local elections and the establishment of 
Community and District councils in 2005 launched a variety of local activities and 
expectations that could not be properly addressed under the existing institutional framework. 
The Local Government Service Act of 2008 helped clarify responsibilities as it was the first 
law to clarify the roles and responsibilities of local officials and central GOL officials 
working at the local levels. As GTZ is the key partner and the Bank does not have ongoing 
support in the area of decentralization, the prior actions identified for PRCS-2 no longer 
cover support in this area. 

56. 
Lesotho has been a relative latecomer to public sector reform and is trying to catch up 
quickly. As a result, the remaining PRSC agenda is daunting. In other countries, similar 
agendas have required considerable coordination, technical assistance (TA), time, and 
commitment. The challenge for Lesotho will be the speedy delivery of results that improve 
governance through a more efficient and effective public sector to make Lesotho more 
competitive in the region. More efficient public spending is even more relevant today when 
the availability of public resources is decreasing as SACU revenues shrink. In moving 
forward, the Bank and other donors should take into account GOL’s capacity limitations and 
strive to keep the program designs simple. 

V. 

Bank Performance 

57. 
Actual lending has followed the CAS program, with the exception of the proposed 
GEF operation, which could not be delivered for reasons noted. Appendix tables A1 and A2 
provide information on the projects that were active at the beginning of the CAS and the 
projects that were approved during the CAS. Table A5 compares planned with actual 
lending. As of May 1 ,2010 , 6 IDA operations and 1 GPOBA48 grant (in the amount of US$6 
million) were active in the Lesotho portfolio. The PRSC I has been closed and the PRSC I1 
was approved by Board on March 30 ,2010 . Total lending commitments are approximately 
$100.7 million, of which as of May 1 ,2010 . The bulk of the disbursements in FY06-07 had 
come from operations under implementation a t the beginning of the CAS (table A3). In 
FY09 new operations approved during the CAS implementation took off and outperformed 
the old ones on the disbursement front. The disbursement ratio in FY09 reached 38.6 
percent, which was above the Sub-Saharan Africa average. Nevertheless, the bulk of the 
results came from the operations active a t the beginning of the CAS period since half of the 
portfolio is young. 

58. 
Likewise, delivery of the AAA program is roughly on target. Two studies were 
dropped: Justice and Law Reform, and a Transport Sector 
The analytical work on 
poverty (shared growth) and vulnerability was direly needed and is now available to inform 
the preparation of the coming 2010 Country Assistance Strategy. The work on creating 
shared growth by reducing inequality and vulnerability analyzes a broad range of relevant 
topics and provides recommendations based on the international experience. An Investment 
Climate Review (ICR) and a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) in the form of the

were delivered during the CAS period and buttress the increasing emphasis on growth. 

5 9 . 

The current portfolio of six projects shows mixed performance. There is one problem 
project-the Water Sector Improvement Project Phase 1 (WSIP I). In addition, the rating of 
the Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic Diversification Project recently was 
downgraded, for reasons stated in para. 22 above. Thus, the commitment at risk amounts to 
$14.1 million and constitutes 18.6 percent of the portfolio. The index of proactivity stands at 
100 percent, which means that the response of the country team to emerging problems is 
timely and effective. At the same time, the latest weakening of portfolio performance calls 
for increased staff and management attention to the portfolio quality and implementation 
support. 

60. 
The last formal Country Portfolio Review (CPR) took place in June 2008. Its 
recommendations provided a comprehensive and strategic overview of portfolio performance 
and the portfolio’s alignment with CAS objectives. The CPR also pointed out persisting 
implementation issues (implementation delays, project management difficulties, institutional 
issues, FM) that may not have been reflected in the project ratings but which could affect 
projects’ performances. The CPR Note highlighted the necessity to ensure good alignment 
among portfolio, CAS, and other DP programs. The CPR Note also urged that the 
government and other DPs agree on a modus operandi for systematic, coordinated and 
integrated portfolio/program and CAS implementation monitoring. However, the same 
Portfolio Review Note warns against complacency and calls for closer and timelier tracking 
of the program and its impact on development outcomes. The review note recommends that 
the team informally track performance on a continua; basis; and formally track it with the 
authorities and other development partners p e r i o d i ~ a l l y . ~ ~ More proactive tracking helps to 
(a) promptly address delivery delays and (b) fine-tune the results framework to improve the 
program’s alignment with the development outcomes. 

61 , 
Reviews of projects already completed show mixed results. Four projects were 
completed during the CAS period and reviewed internally by the teams. The country teams 
rated two of them (HIV/AIDS and Highland Water) as satisfactory on both outcomes and 
Bank performance. The team rated the Education Sector Development Program (EDSP 11) as 
satisfactory on outcomes and moderately satisfactory on Bank performance. The team rated 
the Utilities Sector Reform Project moderately satisfactory on both counts. The team rated 
Maloti Drakensberg GEF moderately satisfactory on outcomes and moderately unsatisfactory 
on Bank performance. Health Sector Reform Project I1 was closed in FY 10 and not has been 
rated yet. 

62 . 
Lesotho’s current performance is in line with the average of Sub-Saharan Africa 
countries. However, the evidence points to shortcomings in, among others, institutional 
development impact and performance at entry. The evidence here refers to the project 
reviews undertaken by the Bank’s Independent Evaluation Office (IEG). The most recent 
moderately unsatisfactory rating for EDSP I1 on outcomes and mixed portfolio performance 
calls for the teams to pay more attention to (a) project design, that is, to make an upfront shift 
in quality design and (b) institutional sustainability, given cases of backsliding after projects

are completed. IEG also reviewed the Utilities Sector Reform Project and rated it 
Moderately Satisfactory on outcomes and implementation performance. 

63. 
The Bank has been working closely with development partners on multiple fronts. 
The Bank?s role in partnering with other donors differs from sector to sector. In HIV/AIDS, 
the Bank is helping to build the GOL?s capacity to effectively use available resources from 
Global Fund, Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and PEPFAR. In water, it is 
helping to mobilize and leverage sizable resources from MCC, the European Investment 
Bank (EIB), Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), OPEC Fund for 
International Development (OFID), Kuwait Fund, Saudi Fund, and Republic of South Africa 
to continue investment in infrastructure and increase coverage. In the education sector, the 
Bank works closely with FTI, Irish Aid, and Japan International Cooperation Association 
(JICA). As the CAS foresaw, overall, the Bank has succeeded in leveraging development 
partners? aid inflows. The Development Partners Consultative Forum (DPCF) proved to be 
an effective way to achieve the stated goals, and the Bank plays an important role in 
coordinating and harmonizing aid. However, the leadership of the authorities, particularly 
the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, is essential to enhance the donors? 
coordination. 

VI, 

Looking Forward: Lessons and Recommendations 

64. 
The Bank program has contributed significant results in the areas in which it has been 
involved longer, including water, electricity, and education. In these areas, the Bank has 
made a sustained effort and focused on institution building. The new areas of Bank 
engagement, mainly competitiveness and strengthening the capacity of the state, are very 
relevant, but the program has yet to deliver solid results. AAA work is well aligned with 
country needs and priorities: shared growth, effective management of public funds, and 
decentralization. However, this work has not always been timely in terms of project 
preparation and the country stills lacks updated information on poverty incidence. Portfolio 
performance is mixed, with 1 problem project and 2 projects out of 5 having been 
downgraded in their performance ratings. 

65. 
The paradox is that in spite of the broadly positive economic performance during the 
CAS period, the development challenges remain roughly the same as when the CAS was 
designed. HIV/AIDS incidence remains high as do poverty and economic inequality, despite 
a rate of economic growth higher than expected. The likelihood of reaching the MDG targets 
is mixed across the targets. Competitiveness continues facing the same challenges and risks, 
and Lesotho is missing a refined strategic vision of how best to profit from the regional and 
global opportunities. At the same time, the global economic crisis brought new challenges of 
sharply declining SACU revenues with a potential threat to the country?s macro and fiscal 
stability. 

66. 
At the heart of this paradox is the fact that Lesotho?s political difficulties until the end 
of the 1990s meant delays in starting reforms in critical areas, such as public sector 
governance and competitiveness, in which other countries have been working for a longer 
time. As a consequence, Lesotho faces a catch-up problem, which in turn leads to the design 
of ambitious agendas that test the country?s limited capacities. Therefore, the main lessons 
and recommendations center around two actions. The first is to build capacity. The second 

62 

is to prioritize and streamline the reform agenda to avoid over-ambitious undertakings that 
create fatigue and a feeling of failure, as was the case in the CAS under review. Third, it also 
should be kept in mind that no Progress Report was prepared. Hence, there was no mid-term 
opportunity to bring greater realism to the results framework. 

VII. Develop a Credible Capacity Building Strategy 

67. 
Bank country teams and the GOL share the consensus that lack of capacity is a major 
constraint to program effectiveness and to the advance of reform initiatives. The present 
Completion Report finds that the evidence supports this consensus. Moreover, since results 
are interconnected across themes, delays in one area, such as decentralization, slow progress 
in others, such as service delivery. 

68. 
The emphasis on capacity is not new. The FY06-09 CAS called on partners to think 
how best to break (release) the capacity constraints. The avenues tried included improving 
capacity within projects. This approach has worked well in repeat operations and when the 
emphasis includes putting in place the incentives to sustain institutional designs. The 
accomplishments in the water sector are an example. 

69. 
Another approach was to use IDA h n d s to break capacity constraints and facilitate 
access to international f h d s and their implementation. This approach has worked in 
HIV/AIDS by helping to mobilize and use external funds. However, the AIDS efforts 
initiated a t mid-stream have yet to make an impact on development outcomes. The lesson 
that emerges is that it takes time to establish a modus operandi of how to break the capacity 
constraints to deliver results on the ground. The challenge is to shorten the learning lag. 

70. 
In tackling capacity constraints, it is important to bear in mind that capacity is a catch 
word that covers a variety of concerns. Examples include the lack of trained personnel, such 
as physicians; weak program design; weak incentives and institutions; and commitment from 
the authorities. Hence, any approach must take account of the specifics at the sector and the 
project levels. For instance, it is necessary to understand the drivers of brain drain, the 
factors that delay adopting new legislation, and the reasons behind slow implementation of 
the reforms. Doing so enables the design of effective tailor-made capacity building 
interventions as a prerequisite for successful implementation of the Bank program. 

VIII. Rethink and Sharpen the Growth (Competitiveness) Strategy 

71. 
Rethinking the current competitiveness strategy beyond its emphasis on improving 
the business environment and putting in place the required infrastructure should acquire a 
focus on shared g r o w t h - o n e of Lesotho’s greatest challenges. The lesson is that shared 
growth is not likely to happen by itself. It needs a determined focus. The previous CAS 
raised the issue but did not articulate a strategy due to lack of supporting analytical 
underpinning. Recent reviews provide some ground upon which to begin to think about 
shared growth. However, an updated understanding of poverty incidence is needed, because 
the most recent information is seven years old (April 2003).’l 

5 1 The precise title of the study is “Lesotho: Sharing Growth by Reducing Inequality and Vulnerability: A 
Poverty, Gender, and Social Assessment” (May 30 ,2008) . Its wide range of themes include, most notably, 

63 

72. 

A shared growth strategy should include attention to:

Agriculture and rural development, for which a roadmap beyond the last CAS is 
needed. 
Encouragement of local entrepreneurship, including focus on the development of 
adequate skills and increasing the relevance of tertiary education. 
Thinking through the role of the state, which absorbs 70 percent of GDP. The state’s 
expenditures leave very limited space for private economic activity, leading to very 
weak internal constituencies to promote economic activity. One possibility that other 
countries have used is to create strong pro-growth advocates-whether government 
agencies or NGOs-within 
the state itself. 
Sustained efforts are needed to increase public sector effectiveness, catch up with 
improving public expenditure practices, and get a handle on decentralization. These 
moves not only would improve service delivery but also would prepare for a possible 
decline in the resources available to Lesotho from regional agreements. 

IX. 

Think Regionally 

73 . 
One lesson from the past is that Lesotho’s success in utilizing the opportunities 
offered by the 2000 African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) turned the country’s 
attention to international markets, possibly a t the expense of thinking regionally. Therefore, 
some rebalancing is needed to counter the continued risks in the global economy. That 
rebalancing may come in the form of strategies that exploit the considerable positional 
advantages that Lesotho has in the region given its wage levels, access to markets, and past 
experience of profiting from opportunity, as in the case of water. Thinking regionally will 
mean making sure that institutional mechanisms work. An example would be enhancing 
customs cooperation between Lesotho and South Africa. Thinking regionally also means 
learning from other countries in the region that have developed more competitive business 
environments. 

X. 

Improve the Effectiveness of the Bank’s Interventions 

74. 
The limited resources that the Bank provides to Lesotho call for thinking creatively 
about effectiveness. Besides a continuous focus on addressing capacity constraints and the 
simplification of objectives, the Bank will aid the effectiveness of its interventions by taking 
a proactive advocacy position in critical areas such as shared growth to help build ownership. 
In Lesotho, as elsewhere, the central government’s ownership, through the commitment and 
allocation of political priority and economic resources, is a fundamental driver of success in 
delivering results. Ownership, however, is not automatic even when the authorities have 
made public statements on desired outcomes. Through AAA, dissemination, and TA, the 
Bank can do much more to sharpen clarity of objectives and intended results. In this regard, 
the Bank can help in providing space for the internal dialogue (Basotho-Basotho), which is 
now quite limited and for which the Bank could help develop a culture of dialogue and 
coordination. 

. 

agriculture and rural development, delivery of public services, and an in-depth review of the status of 
HIV/AIDS. 

64 

75. 
In turn, the Bank can strengthen its position as a strategic partner to Lesotho by 
supporting the authorities in addressing the immediate challenges that the country will face in 
the coming years. First, regional rearrangements will lead to a loss of public revenue, calling 
for a major restructuring of the public function. Second, the country is facing a weakening of 
its international privileges and must look for alternative ways to participate in the global and 
the regional economies. Third, the political balance may suffer under drastic internal 
readjustments. 

7 6 . 

The Bank also can encourage the GOL to take a more active leadership role in donor 
coordination. Today the country works with donors mainly at the sector level in water, 
education, AIDS, PFM reform, and PSD. However, the coordination is largely donor driven. 
Lesotho needs to be in the driver’s seat through more determined leadership by the Ministry 
of Finance and Development Planning. 

77 . 
Last, continued progress should help prepare Lesotho to move from IDA funds to 
access World Bank fbnds on IBRD terms, especially for enclave projects. Lesotho already 
has taken this step for the Highlands Water project.

1. 
As part of the preparation of the CAS, 2010-14, a series of consultations were 
organized over a period of eighteen months with key stakeholders. The first of these took 
place on September 29-30 ,2008 and involved representatives from the GOL, donors, civil 
society and the private sector, and the World Bank. This meeting served to define key 
objectives that the GOL wished to pursue over the medium term and constraints to their 
achievement. The GOL identified two priorities in the area of poverty reduction: improved 
social protection and the promotion of shared and sustainable growth. Much of the discussion 
focused on the latter objective. 

2. 
At the session, there was agreement that the promotion of shared and sustainable 
growth required actions in several areas. The first of these was a more efficient public sector 
framework which would focus on facilitating and encouraging the private sector. In this area, 
several domains of public intervention were identified: improved business climate, enhanced 
access to finance, addressing the HIV/AIDs pandemic, alignment of the education system with 
economic needs, better infrastructure, and improved land management. Another key area for 
the promotion of shared and sustainable growth was private sector development through the 
promotion of labor-intensive sectors. In this area, specific sectoral constraints were identified 
and concrete actions proposed for addressing these constraints. The third area identified as 
central to the promotion of shared and sustainable growth was regional integration. Here, as 
well, specific actions were identified to allow Lesotho to take fuller advantage of its regional 
context. 

3. 
A broad theme that was discussed during the September 2008 meeting was the need 
to improve implementation of policies and strategies. Much of the discussion here focussed 
on capacity weaknesses and the actions that could be taken to enhance local capacity. 
Specific solutions were proposed for capacity problems in the public and private sectors as 
well a s in civil society organizations. The need to improve public sector institutions received 
considerable attention. There was also recognition of the need for better communication 
among key stakeholders; e.g., between the GOL and civil society, between donors and the 
Government, and within the private sector. 

4. 
Finally, the meeting generated specific suggestions for the World Bank CAS, notably 
the need to be more explicit about how results are to be achieved and the need to improve the 
approach to capacity building in Bank activities. 

5 . 
At the September 2008 meeting, Finance Minister Thahane suggested that before 
moving on with the CAS preparation the Bank should prepare a series of policy notes which 
can help Lesotho increase its productive capacity in response to the possible decline in SACU 
revenue, address constraints to growth, and explore prospects for new growth sectors such as 
agriculture and tourism. These policy notes were subsequently prepared and discussed with 
the Minister and the Lesotho delegation during the Spring Meetings in 2009 and then with the 
whole Cabinet on July 20 ,2009 . The GOL has acknowledged that the policy notes provided 
the analytical underpinning for the development of the Government's growth strategy and the 
GOL's budget for 2010/11 

82 

6. 
More recently, the World Bank (WB) and Government of Lesotho (GOL) organized a 
multi-stakeholder forum on Lesotho’s country assistance strategy (CAS), on March 18-1 9, 
201 0. The participants of this development dialogue platform comprised GOL officials, 
academics, private sector representatives, international and local NGOs, faith based 
organisations (FBOs) and youth organisations. 

7 . 
In the opening session of the forum, Minister Thahane expressed the GOL’s 
appreciation for the well established development partnership with World Bank that is based 
on openness, frankness and honesty. In the 2009- 10 periods, Lesotho is dealing with a multi- 
faceted crisis given the adverse impact of an external economic crisis and deepening poverty 
and inequality and the imperatives of fiscal adjustment and public service efficiencyTo 
address these interrelated challenges, the GOL needs to have clear policies and strategies. 
Given the GOL’s limited resources, its role is to create an enabling framework for private 
sector led growth, level the playing field, provide a minimum infrastructure platform and 
develop a skilled and healthy human resource base. Meanwhile GOL still needs to enhance its 
service delivery to poor and vulnerable citizens and combat HIV/AIDS effectively. 

8 . 

Ms. Lebona, Director-MOFDP, then outlined Lesotho’s long term and medium term 
development challenges that are based on a clear appreciation of threats and constraints as 
well as opportunities facing the Country. In summary, GOL’s current priorities are; 

A shared growth strategy which is broad based and addresses inequalities. 
Expanding the production base by improving the investment climate for the private 
sector and enabling the doing of business 
Human development that also protects the poor, vulnerable and youth. 
Effective public service delivery at the central and local levels 
Effective strategies to combat HIV/ADS. 

9. 
The Government Secretary, Mr. Sekhamane presented the background, rationale and 
major components of GOL’s service delivery agenda (SDA) to be implemented by the Public 
Service a t the central, sectoral and local levels. SDA is a radical approach to achieve the 
MDGs and is an appropriate response to the multi-faceted crisis facing Lesotho in 2010 - 
20 14. The key SDA principles are; ethos of efficient service to citizens, accountability, 
monitoring and evaluation, listening to the people and addressing their needs. Accordingly, 
the Prime Minister and GOL’s cabinet are fully committed to the overall goals of the SDA 
campaign. While appreciating the SDA, Participants wanted the full involvement of Non- 
State Actors (NSAs), Faith Based Organizations (FBOs) and Traditional AuthoritiedChiefs in 
the implementation of the SDA. 

10. 
The World Bank representative presented the key themes of the envisioned CAS for 
20 10-14: fiscal adjustment and public sector efficiency; human development and improved 
service delivery; and economic diversification and improved competitiveness. These themes 
were endorsed as appropriate by the forum participants. 

8 3 

1 1 . 
The key messages, issues and questions that emerged in plenary discussions were the 
following. While Lesotho’s long term Vision 2020 goals are appreciated, these 2010 
consultations provide an opportunity for a mid-term review of Vision 2020 goals. Lesotho 
needs to derive lessons from implementing the 8 priorities of the poverty reduction strategy 
(PRS) since 2004/05. Lesotho must manage brain drain through effective human resource 
retention strategies while taking full advantage of its location within RSA, SACU and SADC 
region. Lesotho faces a crisis of worsening poverty, high unemployment, deteriorating human 
development indicators, inequalities and chronic vulnerability and environmental degradation. 
To achieve shared growth in this context, serious choices and strategic options have to be 
pursued, such as investment climate reform to enable private sector and FDI led growth, 
supporting growth of SMMES , commercializing agriculture, reducing economic and social 
costs of rural to urban mobility, adjusting the size of the public sector equitably to ensure 
effective service delivery to poor, rural and marginalized communities. Generally, there is 
need to do much more with much less resources.
