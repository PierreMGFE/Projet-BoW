EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
Owing to their small size and populations, the countries of the Organization of Eastern 
Caribbean States (OECS) face challenges of diseconomies of scale, especially in infrastructure, 
institutions, and markets.  Their location also makes them vulnerable to periodic natural disasters 
and climate change phenomena, such as rising sea levels.  While they enjoy the benefits of very 
open economies, they are at the same time vulnerable to external events and shocks such as the 
removal of trade preferences and the still unfolding impact of the recent global financial crisis. 
They have achieved middle income status, but several continue to face the challenges of youth 
unemployment, crime and public security, as well as weak institutions and economic management 
that have contributed to their high public debt and problematical business environment. 

ii. 
This Regional Partnership Strategy covers the five-year period July 2009―June 2014.                                                                                                                                                 
It is the basis for the World Bank Group’s engagement with the countries of the Eastern Caribbean, 
sub-regional organizations and other development partners in pursuit of the following strategic 
objectives: (a) building resilience; and (b) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating growth over 
the medium term. To help build resilience, the Bank Group1 will support interventions aimed at 
promoting fiscal and debt sustainability, protecting and improving human capital―particularly 
social safety nets, education and health―and strengthening climate resilience.  To help enhance 
competitiveness and stimulate sustainable growth, it will focus its support on two critical areas: 
strengthening the countries’ domestic financial sectors and improving access to quality services to 
create more competitive business environments.  The Strategy will provide urgent remedial 
measures to address the crippling effects of the global and regional crises, while supporting key 
policy reforms that establish a platform for growth in the medium term. 

iii. 
These strategic objectives and the Bank Group’s planned program of support are fully 
consistent with the framework for medium- and long-term sub-regional development defined by 
OECS’ Secretariat and by the countries themselves through a broad consultative process.  The 
Strategy was prepared taking into account the OECS’ Development Strategy, the Eastern 
Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU)’s Eight-Point Stabilization and Growth Programme, national 
strategy papers, and the Bank’s own analytical work.  It was widely discussed with and endorsed 
by the countries, by sub-regional and regional organizations, and by other development partners at 
in-country consultations during 2009 and the first quarter of 2010. 

iv. 
The planned program of support will entail new commitments totaling up to about $120 
million on IBRD terms and up to about $73 million of IDA financing during FYs10-14.2  Both 
numbers are indicative and subject to individual country allocations under IDA 16 as well as 
IBRD’s lending capacity.  While each project will be tailored to the individual needs of each 
country, the Bank will encourage coordination and the grouping of similar operations under one 
regional program or umbrella in order to foster enhanced sub-regional cooperation and also to 
maximize scarce specialized resources.  In parallel, IFC will cont inue to support private sector 
activities through investment and advisory services targeted at financial markets, infrastructure, the 
investment climate as well as growth sectors and tourism.  

v. 
The main risks to successful implementation of the Strategy include: (a) possible natural 
disasters and other unforeseen exogenous shocks that could further exacerbate individual 

1 The term ―Bank Group‖ in this document refers to IBRD/IDA together with the IFC; while ―Bank‖ refers to 
IBRD/IDA or both. 
2 This does not include regional IDA which the RPS has been designed to take maximum advantage of in order to 
augment the relatively small national IDA envelopes.

countries’ vulnerabilities, leading inter alia to fiscal slippages; (b) OECS authorities’ inability or 
unwillingness collectively to restore fiscal and debt sustainability; (c) insufficient political will for 
closer regional coordination and integration; and (d) weak project implementation capacity at both 
national and sub-regional levels.  

vi. 
The Strategy and program seek to manage these risks through continued and/or increased 
support for fiscal and debt sustainability, disaster risk mitigation, an improved business climate to 
increase competitiveness and promote economic diversification, and a focus on capacity building 
at both national and regional levels.  Additional efforts will also be made to ensure that Bank-
supported activities are grounded in national and/or regional strategies.

I. 

OVERVIEW 

1. 
The setting for this Regional Partnership Strategy (―RPS‖ or ―Strategy‖) is the worsened 
economic environment caused by the recent global economic recession which reduced growth in 
the United States and the United Kingdom—the two main sources of tourists for countries of the 
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)3—decreased remittances and foreign direct 
investment, and exacerbated internal structural weaknesses, such as supervision of the financial 
system.  On the positive side, OECS governments viewed the crisis as an opportunity to tackle 
some of their more significant sub-regional challenges in an effort to build resilience, enhance 
competitiveness, and stimulate sustainable growth in the medium term. 

2. 
The Strategy also takes into account OECS countries’ peculiar characteristics and 
common development needs.  First, owing to their small size and population, they face challenges 
of diseconomies of scale, especially in infrastructure, institutions, and markets.  Second, their 
location makes them vulnerable to frequent natural disasters, especially hurricanes, and climate 
change phenomena such as rising sea levels.  For example, historical data indicate that the 
probability of a hurricane in any given year is about 18% for the Eastern Caribbean Currency 
Union (ECCU)4 region.5  Third, while they enjoy the benefits of very open economies, they are at 
the same time vulnerable to external events and shocks such as the removal of trade preferences 
and the still unfolding impact of the recent global financial crisis.  Fourth, they have achieved 
middle income status, but some continue to face the challenges of youth unemployment, crime 
and public security, as well as weak institutions and economic management that have contributed 
to their high public debt and difficult business environment.  Finally, the recent creation of an 
economic union, expected to become effective shortly, has also influenced the Strategy’s design. 

3. 
The document is organized as follows: Section II reviews the OECS region’s political, 
social and economic context (including issues relating to gender) and governance; Section III 
analyzes its key development challenges and priorities; Section IV, after reviewing the lessons 
learned from previous Bank involvement, outlines the proposed Strategy for the next five years, 
FY10-14; and Section V assesses the risks and describes how the Bank Group plans to manage 
them.

REGIONAL CONTEXT 

A. 

Economic Cooperation and Integration 

4. 
The OECS was formed in 1981 in an attempt to address some of the political and 
economic limitations posed by its member countries’ small size and population.  Since then, 
their common features and interests have provided a firm foundation upon which a supra-national 
architecture has been built to help create a stable environment for the sub-region’s socio-
economic advancement.6  OECS’ achievements to date in terms of deepening regional integration 

3 While the OECS comprises six independent countries and three British Overseas Territories, this Strategy covers 
only the six independent countries, namely: Antigua and Barbuda; Dominica; Grenada; St. Kitts and Nevis; St. 
Lucia; and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Excepting St. Vincent and the Grenadines which did not join IFC, all are 
members of the World Bank Group.    
4 The ECCU consists of the OECS member countries as defined in footnote 3.  
5  IMF Staff Report for the ECCU, 2009. 
6 For the purpose of this Strategy, ―sub -region‖ refers to the OECS’ six independent countries.

include: (a) a comprehensive approach to economic and functional cooperation (foreign, defense 
and security policies) as set out in the Treaty of Basseterre (1981)7; (b) a common currency and 
central bank―the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB); (c) an integrated legal system; (d) 
collective regulation of banking and securities, telecommunications―e.g. the Eastern Caribbean 
Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL)— and civil aviation―e.g. the Eastern Caribbean Civil 
Aviation Authority (ECCAA); and (e) coordinated approaches to critical shared sectors such as 
education, health, agriculture, tourism, export development, the environment, and maritime 
matters.8 

5. 
Despite the severe economic downturn, the OECS continues to pursue ambitious 
goals for further economic and political integration.  To this end, a treaty establishing the 
OECS Economic Union was initialed by heads of government on December 29, 2009 and is 
expected to be signed on June 18, 2010.  Its most significant feature is the transfer of legislative 
competence from national parliaments to the OECS Authority—the principal organ within the 
Economic Union comprising Heads of State—in five agreed areas: the common market and 
customs union; monetary policy; trade policy; maritime jurisdiction and boundaries; and civil 
aviation.  In practice, this means that legislation approved by the Authority will apply 
automatically in each member country.  While there is some debate among regional scholars 
about the constitutional ramifications of these provisions in each country, the OECS Secretariat 
has confirmed what is written in the Treaty, namely that its implementation will not require 
constitutional amendments.

OECS countries, as members of the ECCU share a common central bank.  The 
ECCB is headquartered in St. Kitts and Nevis and manages the Eastern Caribbean dollar, a 
common currency for the OECS and two dependent territories, Anguilla and Montserrat, which 
has been pegged to the US dollar since 1976 at EC$2.7 per US$1.  Exchange rate stability has 
helped foster a highly monetized and stable financial system.  Unlike monetary policy, which is 
coordinated by the ECCB, fiscal policy is handled separately by each government.  While the 
currency union has worked well, inadequate coordination of fiscal policies has constrained the 
development of a sound macroeconomic framework conducive to growth, low unemployment 
and debt sustainability.  In this latter context, the ECCB has stipulated that each member should 
attain a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60% by 2020.

Political Context 

7. 
OECS members boast open democracies characterized by political stability with 
high participation in elections.  They retain the British parliamentary system inherited at 
independence as well as civil services that, relative to their small size, are large, bureaucratic and 
burdensome.  Prime Minister Denzil Douglas was re-elected on January 25, 2010 for a fourth 
consecutive term, winning six out of eight seats from St. Kitts in the eleven seat national 
assembly.  Prime Minister Skerrit of Dominica was re-elected in December 2009 with 18 of 21 
seats.  In July 2008, Tillman Thomas was elected as Grenada’s Prime Minister by an 11 to 4 
majority.  Prime Minister Spencer of Antigua and Barbuda was re-elected in March 2009.  St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines (current Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves) and St. Lucia (current 
Prime Minister Stephenson King) must hold elections by December 2010 and 2011 respectively.  

7 The Treaty of Basseterre also established the OECS Secretariat. 
8 While these issues are addressed mainly at the national level, efforts are made to coordinate approaches regionally 
so as to optimize benefits.

Presently, four of the six Prime Ministers, including those of Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and 
Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are also their countries’ Ministers of Finance. 

C. 

Governance  

8. 
OECS members adhere to a fully functioning democratic constitutional framework. 
Their public administrations are characterized by well established organizational structures and 
institutional rules and regulations, respect for the rule of law, and a high degree of judicial 
independence.  World Governance Indicators (2008) place OECS countries within the 50-90th 
percentile worldwide.  In Transparency International’s 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), 
St. Lucia ranked 22nd of 180 countries, St. Vincent and the Grenadines 31st and Dominica 34th 
(other OECS countries were not surveyed).9  In striving to improve the performance of their 
public sectors, OECS countries’ reform strategies focus on incremental strengthening and 
modernization, improving the quality of service delivery, and responding to citizens’ demands.  

D. 

Social Context  

9. 
OECS countries achieved important social milestones as a result of strong growth 
during the 1980s and early 1990s.  They rank highly on the United Nations Human 
Development Index compared to other countries at similar income levels.  An assessment of their 
MDGs indicates progress towards achievement of several, including reduction of extreme poverty 
and hunger, universal primary education, gender equality, and improved maternal health.  
Primary education is universal and net enrolments at secondary level are high, ranging from 78% 
and 80% in Grenada and St. Lucia respectively to 95% in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and to 
100% in St. Kitts and Nevis in 2009.  Infant mortality is low, ranging from 7–9/1000 live births 
and average life expectancy is comparable to that of OECD countries.  However, additional 
efforts will be needed to achieve the remaining MDGs by 2015.10  Progress needs to be made in 
enrollment ratios in Dominica and Grenada. 

10. While OECS countries are classified as upper Middle Income Countries (MICs),  
poverty ranges from 18-38% of their population.  The dearth of reliable data precludes any 
firm conclusion about trends but, if the experience of other Caribbean countries is any guide, 
poverty has probably 
increased following 
the recent economic and financial crisis. 
Unemployment varies from country to country and in some―St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. 
Lucia, and Grenada―is much higher than the average for countries at similar income levels.  
Other social indicators vary less within the OECS, with some better than in comparable countries, 
particularly infant and under-five mortality.  Owing to lack of data, both the gap between rich and 
poor and trends in all countries are unclear.  Based on experience in other Latin America and 
Caribbean countries, however, is it safe to assume that the recent crisis affected poor households 
in three ways: reduced purchasing power arising from higher food and fuel prices; lower 
remittances; and increased unemployment as a result of slowing economic activity. 

11. 
Primary school enrolment and completion rates are similar for boys and girls in all 
countries and secondary enrolments are close to gender parity in most.  In St. Lucia and St. 
Vincent, the ratio of female to male enrolments in secondary education is 112.9% and 124.0% 

9 The country ranked number 1 is ranked as least corrupt on the Corruption Perception Index.

respectively.11  However, as in the rest of the Caribbean, the drop-out rate is generally higher for 
boys than for girls, with girls more likely to continue their education past primary and secondary. 
These gaps are rapidly growing.  However, analysis of regional labor market trends in the 
Caribbean does not reveal systematic discrimination by gender. 

12. 
Anecdotal evidence indicates a growing number of ‘jobless’ or ‘idle’ youth , i.e. young 
people who are neither working nor in school―a trend, evident elsewhere in Latin America and 
the Caribbean, that is particularly alarming, owing to their propensity to become involved in 
crime.12   Because of the relatively low opportunity cost, idle urban youth are often recruited to 
sell drugs.  This is possibly reflective of the social problems associated with lack of family ties 
and growing urbanization.  Crime and violence are also largely concentrated amongst the poorest 
and amongst young males (14-24 years) who may be victims as well as perpetrators of violent 
crime.  

13. 
There is a clear gender dimension to the problems of at-risk youth, since boys and 
girls tend to engage differently in different kinds of risky behaviors.  While we often think of 
girls when we think of gender, boys are the ones who are losing ground in the Caribbean.  Young 
women have their own struggles such as higher unemployment rates than boys and earlier family 
responsibilities, but young males are perhaps the source of the most costly ills such as early 
school leaving (relative to girls), high rates of idleness, and high rates of criminality.    

14. 
In reproductive health, OECS countries are doing extremely well with almost all 
births attended by trained health staff.  However, the countries that present data on adolescent 
(15-19) fertility rates demonstrate very high rates: Grenada 42.4%; St. Lucia 60% and St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines 63.9%.13 

15. 
All Caribbean countries have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Inter-American Convention on 
the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women. While legislation for 
equal rights and access to law exist, enforcement is often lacking.  Men’s involvement in risky 
sexual behavior, violent activities, and substance abuse continues to increase and exceeds that of 
women.  Violence against women remains a persistent problem.  For example, in St. Kitts and 
Nevis the Domestic Violence Act of 2000 criminalizes domestic violence and provides penalties 
for abusers, but there are no laws for sexual harassment.  In all OECS countries, constitutional 
rights do not discriminate based on gender and laws provide for equal opportunities for men and 
women.  Nevertheless, women’s involvement in political activities lags behind that of men. The 
share of parliamentary seats occupied by women varies from 5.6% in St Lucia to 18.2% in St. 
Vincent and the number of female ministers varies from one in St. Kitts and St. Vincent, and 2 of 
15 or 13% in Dominica.

Economic Context  

Recent Developments  

16. 

Following strong growth during the 1980s and early 1990s in a benign external 
environment, economic performance weakened in the late 1990s and early 2000s, partly due 
to deteriorating external conditions.  Real GDP growth averaged 6.1% in the 1980s but 
declined to 3.2% in the 1990s and further to 2.2% in the 2000s.  Growth in the 1980s was driven 
largely by dynamic services (essentially tourism), public investment and banana exports.  The 
slowdown in the 1990s and 2000s was associated initially with sharp declines in productivity 
growth.  In subsequent years, this was compounded by lower private investment and reduced 
exports as a result of loss of competitiveness and export privileges.  While OECS governments 
responded by increasing public investments once again, this strategy failed to stimulate growth, 
leading instead to growing fiscal imbalances and an unsustainably large debt burden.

During 2003-06, GDP growth accelerated due to resurgence in tourism and related 
construction as well as an emphasis on private sector development.  The financial sector also 
played an important role.  Agriculture contributed only marginally to growth, however, due to the 
continued erosion of market access, trade preferences, and damage caused by natural disasters 
(Figure 1). 

Figure 1: Sectoral contribution to growth in the ECCU (percent)

18. OECS countries are heavily dependent on, and vulnerable to events affecting 
tourism, agriculture and offshore banking and construction.  The last decade has been 
particularly challenging with a succession of external crises―notably September 11, 2001 and 
the global crisis of 2008-09―as well as frequent and powerful hurricanes.   As it enters the 

6 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
second decade of the 21st century, the OECS sub-region is at cross-roads.  On the one hand, it 
could enter a period of strong economic growth based on greater sub-regional integration, 
investment in knowledge, and greater attention to the public sector’s role as regulator rather than 
investor.  On the other, if vulnerability to economic and natural shocks or to internal social 
pressures and demands is not adequately addressed, socio-economic gains could be threatened.  

19. 
At the country level, economic growth and its drivers varied substantially.  While 
Antigua and Barbuda grew at an average of 6.1% annually from 2001-08, Dominica grew at a 
mere 0.8% annually, with other countries falling in between.  The sources of growth also differed, 
with construction making the largest contribution in Antigua and Barbuda (particularly in the 
second half of the decade), trade and transport in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and banking in 
St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Lucia (Figure 2). 

20. Owing to food and energy price hikes and the onset of the global f inancial crisis, 
GDP growth slowed in 2007 and fell below 2% in 2008.  The contribution of tourism to growth 
fell from 1.5 percentage points in 2007 to -0.1 percentage points in 2008 (Figure 1).  
Compounding the impact of food and energy price hikes, the global crisis impacted the Caribbean 
region in three ways: (a) a decline in tourism and reduced exports; (b) lower remittances from 
migrant workers; and (c) reduced investment inflows and tightened access to capital markets. 
Owing to its effect on regional financial institutions, the contribution of banking and insurance to 
growth declined as well. 

21. 
The global slowdown led to reduced growth in all OECS countries except Dominica. 
Grenada recorded the largest decline in real GDP (―7.7 percentage points) and St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines the smallest (―1.1 percentage points).  Dominica’s real GDP growth of 1.1% in 
2009 was underpinned by the strong post-hurricane recovery of the banana industry and 
construction activity financed by public sector development projects (Figure 2). 

22. 
The initial adverse effects of the food and energy price increase on inflation were 
fully reversed as the economies contracted and global economic activity declined in 2008 -09. 
In early 2008, the rate of inflation more than doubled from its 20-year historical average of 2-3%, 
but moderated during the second half amid the regional and global slowdown (Figure 3). By end -
2009, inflation was below 3% in the OECS overall and even below 1% in some member countries 
(St. Vincent, St. Kitts and St. Lucia).  

23. 
Inflation also varied substantially by country over the last five years . The cumulative 
inflation since 2005 has been higher in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and St. Kitts and 
Nevis compared to other member countries. The cumulative inflation has been the lowest in 
Antigua & Barbuda.  Also, when inflation accelerated in the second quarter of 2007, the rate of 
increase in consumer prices was much faster in St. Vincent and the Grenadines than in Antigua 
and Barbuda, St. Lucia, or Dominica (Figure 4).

24. 
Following strong growth in 2007, private credit provision has slowed markedly in 
recent years as banks experienced difficulties in raising capital . Growth in monetary 
aggregates decelerated in 2008 and 2009.  As excess reserves of commercial banks at ECCB have 
declined, interest rates on interbank lending have begun to increase. Reflecting rising debt service 
costs and tightening international credit conditions, ECCU sovereign bond spreads have also 
increased. 

25. While OECS’ current account deficit increased rapidly from 16.4% to 33.9% of 
GDP during 2004-08, it fell back to an estimated 24.4% of GDP in 2009 .  This trajectory can 
be explained mostly by changes in the trade balance (Figure 5).  Several factors account for the 
increase in the trade deficit through 2008: higher imports due to reconstruction following natural 
disasters; increased demand for imported consumer goods; and increased imports of investment

goods (mostly for tourism-related construction, including for the 2007 Cricket World Cup).  
While most of the current account deficit was financed by foreign direct investment (FDI) 
through 2008, the drying-up of investment and remittance inflows in 2009 forced a rapid 
adjustment in the trade account. 

26. 
The large swings in the current account balance exemplify the vulnerabilities of 
small island states such as the OECS.  Although larger current account deficits are to be 
expected given the narrow export base and the fact that most investment and consumption goods 
are imported, the sustainability of such deficits poses challenges for long-term development 
unless they can be financed by non-debt creating inflows such as FDI.  Consequently, OECS 
current account dynamics highlight the need for its members to pursue policies which attract FDI 
while also broadening the export base and increasing the stability of export revenues.

27. OECS countries face a massive debt challenge, with a debt-to-GDP ratio averaging 109 
% in 2009 owing mainly to fiscal loosening and exogenous shocks.  In analyzing debt-to-GDP 
ratios from 1998-2008, two characteristics stand out.  First, governments have been running 
primary fiscal deficits.  The increase in fiscal spending during 2002-06 was accompanied by a 
move towards expensive borrowing from commercial markets.  The combination of rapid debt 
accumulation and high interest payments resulted in OECS countries becoming some of the most 
indebted in the world.  Second, the impact of debt-creating exogenous shocks such as natural 
disasters has been considerable, with the OECS sub-region among the most disaster-prone in the 
world.  In fact, years where the growth in debt-to-GDP ratios are largely unexplained by fiscal 
policy have tended to coincide with natural disasters, such as major hurricanes in 1998, 1999, 
2004, 2007, and 2008, all of which had devastating effects.  For example, the estimated damage 
from the 2004 hurricane in Grenada alone exceeded $1 billion, with another $40 million in St.

Vincent and the Grenadines and smaller amounts in other OECS countries.  The fiscal space 
constraints imposed by the impact of such external events on these countries’ debt ratios illustrate 
their fiscal vulnerabilities and underscore the importance of fiscal discipline and prudent debt 
management. 

28. 
In the past two years, the debt situation has worsened with declining global economic 
activity and slow growth in the Caribbean.  As OECS economies were hit by the global crisis 
in 2009, output is estimated to have declined in all member countries excluding Dominica, and 
debt ratios worsened substantially.  In Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada, for example, the 6.5% 
and 7.7% contractions in output together with the widening of the primary deficit led to increases 
in their debt-to-GDP ratios by 15 and 20 percentage points respectively. The average public debt-
to-GDP ratio for the OECS overall is estimated to have increased to 108.7% by end-2009. 

29. 
Despite efforts to wind down public debt through restructuring, the debt service 
burden continues to be heavy. Dominica and Grenada undertook comprehensive debt 
restructurings in the early 2000s.  In the context of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
program, Dominica restructured its debt in 2004-05, which reduced interest rates on commercial 
debt from 8% to 3.5%.  In 2007, St. Vincent and the Grenadines benefited from a debt write-off 
from Italy equivalent to about 10% of GDP, as did Antigua and Barbuda.  Despite these efforts, 
external debt amortization alone averages about 22% of current revenues in the OECS, crowding 
out other public and private expenditures.  Contributing to high debt service costs is the fact that a 
substantial share of the external debt is commercial. To address these challenges, the Bank is 
working with OECS governments and other governments of the Caribbean region to develop a 
framework for fundamental reduction of the debt burden. 

30. 
The impact of the global financial crisis was compounded by regional challenges 
stemming from the collapse of two subsidiaries of a large insurance and banking 
conglomerate. The failure of Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO) and British American 
Insurance Company (BAICO)—two subsidiaries of CL Financial Group which offered high 
interest rates on fixed-term deposits backed by risky investments in the US real estate sector—is 
expected to cost the ECCU dearly.  The deficiency of BAICO is estimated at 6.5% of the ECCU’s 
combined GDP.  It also revealed substantial weaknesses in financial regulation, which OECS 
governments have now taken initial steps to address.  

Macroeconomic Prospects 

31. 
Prospects for recovery in the medium term depend to a large extent on tourism.  
Revenues from tourism contribute more than 23% of GDP for the ECCU as a whole and within 
the OECS range from 33% in Antigua and Barbuda to 18% in Grenada.  Although some countries 
have done better than others, available data indicate that both stay-over and cruise ship arrivals 
contracted by 0.7% and 2.5% respectively in 2008. In the first ten months of 2009, signs of 
recovery have emerged, with cruise ship arrivals increasing by over 23%.  While demand for 
stay-over visits from Canada and Europe is likely to continue declining in 2010, visits from the 
United States—which accounted for one-third of total arrivals in 2009—are expected to increase 
by about 1% over 2009.14 

14 OECS tourism data exclude St. Kitts and Nevis.

33. 
The pace of OECS’ recovery is expected to be slower than elsewhere in Latin 
America and the Caribbean (LAC).  While growth in 2010 is forecast to be positive in all 
OECS members except Antigua and Barbuda―ranging from -1.5% in Antigua and Barbuda to 
2.1% in St. Vincent and the Grenadines―the recovery is likely to be very gradual, substantially 
below the 3% projected for the entire LAC.  Two factors explain this.  First, the delayed recovery 

 
 
 
 
in developed countries’ job markets and the lingering wealth effects of the crisis on household 
expenditures will continue to constrain tourism and remittances.  Second, unfavorable initial 
macroeconomic conditions and limited fiscal space are restricting options for countercyclical 
fiscal policy.  Over the medium-term, growth is expected to follow the global recovery, albeit 
with a lag, reaching an average of 3.4% by 2014. 

34. 
The 2008-09 downturn moderated inflation and the current account deficit which, in 
the near- to medium-term, are expected to remain below the average of recent years .  From 
an average of over 5% in 2006-07, end-of-period consumer price index (CPI) growth is estimated 
to have declined to below 1% in 2009 and is expected to remain in the 2-3% range through 2014. 
This slowdown reflects both the moderating pace of economic activity in the near term and the 
decline of import prices—mainly food and fuel—from their early-2008 highs. With the 
improvement in the terms of trade and the reduced availability of foreign financing—primarily 
FDI—the current account deficit for the ECCU is expected to improve from 34% of GDP in 2008 
to 24% of GDP in 2009-10.  As exports and international remittances recover over the medium-
term, the current account deficit is likely to continue improving to 20% of GDP by 2014. 

35. 
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) using both a deterministic model and stochastic 
simulations show that some OECS countries already face severe situations .  Baseline 
projections are built on the latest macroeconomic forecast consistent with the IMF’s most recent 
economic projections and assume deterioration of economic growth in 2009 (see Appendix 4). 
The main focus is on public debt dynamics rather than rollover risks.  Under the baseline 
scenario, only Dominica and Grenada exhibit steady declines in public debt ratios while some 
countries are on an increasing path.15  Following the steep increase in Grenada’s debt-to-GDP 
ratio from 2008-09 (20 percentage points of GDP), a reduction of 24 percentage points is forecast 
for 2009-14.  Under current assumptions, Dominica is expected to achieve the ECCB’s debt-to-
GDP benchmark of 60% by end-2015.   St. Lucia’s debt-to-GDP ratio increased initially, 
reflecting the impact of the global economic crisis, but is forecast to start declining after 2010-
2011.  Debt-to-GDP ratios for Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines rise over the whole projection period. 

36. 
Alternative scenarios were also carried out to examine: (a) the impact of the current 
global crisis; (b) sensitivities to shifts in interest rates, growth and exchange rates; (c) the 
impact of natural disasters; and (d) the debt ratios under uncertainty around key economic 
variables through stochastic simulations.  Estimates of the impact of the global crisis on most 
countries’ debt-to-GDP ratios are substantial.  Antigua and Barbuda and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines are the most heavily affected.  The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that 
OECS countries’ debt ratios are most sensitive to changes in exchange rates. This is expected 
because they have relied heavily on international borrowing.  A combined shock scenario of 
changes to interest rates, growth and exchange rates has the potential to significantly increase 
debt burdens.  Including the expected cost of natural disasters also shifts debt ratios upward. 
They increase the most for St. Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, and Antigua and Barbuda.  However, 
stochastic simulations show that extreme scenarios have low probability and baseline projections 
are valid overall. 

15 While debt-to-GDP ratios are not in Net Present Value (NPV) terms, an NPV analysis is unlikely to change the 
overall results because the sample period is short.

III. REGIONAL PRIORITIES, CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 

Regional Priorities 

37. 
In 2000, the OECS’ Development Strategy listed the following development 
challenges: (a) pursuing sustainable economic development through the growth of services, 
agriculture, and manufacturing; (b) supplying human resource needs by facilitating access to 
education and training; (c) achieving sustained improvement in the quality of life of the most 
vulnerable; (d) creating jobs; (e) improving health services; and (f) improving the management of 
natural resources.  During the last two years, the OECS’ Secretariat has updated the development 
context for the sub-region’s medium- and longer-term strategy, taking into account opportunities 
emerging from new multilateral trade and economic partnership agreements and, in particular, 
those afforded by the recent establishment of the OECS Economic Union.16  Against this 
background, it is currently preparing a new medium-term strategic framework for development 
which is expected to be ready by end-2010 and include the following priority sectors: agriculture, 
tourism, private sector, education, energy, and social protection.17 During this process the Bank 
has been supporting the policy formulation process through its participation in workshops and 
provision of technical assistance in priority areas such as social protection and education.  

38. 
The food, fuel and financial crises highlighted OECS countries’ vulnerabilities, their 
interdependence, and the need to utilize regional approaches more aggressively to address 
their challenges.  Recent experience in the non-bank financial sector is illustrative where, absent 
a mechanism authorized to carry out cross-border supervision, regulation of firms operating intra-
regionally proved difficult, leaving the sector vulnerable.  To address this issue, OECS countries 
articulated a regional approach in the ECCU’s Eight-Point Stabilization and Growth Programme.  
Its action plan includes elements of fiscal stabilization, reform and regulation of the banking and 
non-banking financial sector, as well as economic stimulus.  The Eight–Point Programme speaks 
to the importance of partnering with the private sector and highlights the needs for policy 
coordination within and between countries and for improved policy making capacity within the 
public service. 

Key Challenges and Opportunities 

39. Key ongoing and emerging challenges likely to impact OECS’ development agenda 
in the short, medium and long term include: (a) improving fiscal and debt management; (b) 
protecting and improving human capital; (c) reducing vulnerability to natural disasters and 
strengthening environmental management; (d) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating 
sustainable growth; (e) reducing crime and enhancing citizen security; and (f) strengthening 
institutional and organizational capacity. This was unambiguously confirmed during recent 
country consultations with representatives of the government and other participants.  These 
challenges are summarized in order below.

A. 

Improving Fiscal and Debt Management 

40. OECS countries are characterized by very high indebtedness .  Total public debt to 
GDP averaged around 99% in 2008―ranging from over 177% in St. Kitts and Nevis to 66% and 
67% in St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines respectively, with others between 87% and 
102%.  About half of the current debt is external, but even domestic debt is pegged to foreign 
currencies by virtue of the ECCU’s fixed exchange-rate regime. (Appendix 4).   

41. 
This high level of public debt is constraining the countries’ development options as 
well as their ability to implement policies to enhance growth and ensure social stability . 
First, debt service is crowding out critical social expenditures and other outlays necessary to 
improve the business environment (Figure 6).  Second, it contributes to increased financing costs 
and interest payments, creating pressure for further borrowing, making the roll-over of maturing 
debt more difficult, and exacerbating the risk of default in some countries.  Third, it limits the 
scope for counter-cyclical fiscal policy to mitigate the impact of the global crisis on the domestic 
economy, with negative implications for unemployment and poverty.   Fourth, it constrains the 
countries’ capacity to deal with natural disasters in a region prone to such disasters where the 
population customarily relies on government help.  Finally, it inhibits governments’ capacity to 
act as development partners and to attract foreign investment through public-private partnerships. 

42. 
If nothing is done, public debt is projected to increase.  The authorities recognize this 
and are currently considering measures to reduce the debt burden and create fiscal space for 
economic and social development. At their request, the Bank is developing a framework solution.  
In addition, CIDA is providing resources to the ECCB for technical assistance to support its help 
to member countries in better managing their debt stock.

43. 
The combined global and regional shocks have prompted the OECS to implement a 
number of measures designed to mitigate their social, fiscal, and regulatory impact .  For 
example, to soften the impact of price increases, the governments implemented a number of 
measures to protect the most vulnerable parts of the population.  These included the suspension of 
import duties and other taxes on basic consumer items, controls on retail markups and profit 
margins, and limited commodity price subsidies to vulnerable groups.

44. While these measures were effective, they also worsened governments’ fiscal 
positions at a time of sharply lower government revenues.  To address this challenge, some 
governments have taken action to control the size of public payrolls, to enhance public sector 
performance and efficiency by undertaking functional and expenditure reviews, and negotiating 
wage freezes with unions. They have also sought additional financing from international financial 
institutions (IFI) and donors: Grenada has received additional funds under its IMF Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program; St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica and 
St. Lucia have received financing under the Rapid-Access component of the IMF’s Exogenous 
Shocks Facility; St. Kitts and Nevis has received assistance under the IMF’s Emergency 
Assistance for Natural Disasters Facility; Grenada has received support under the EC 
Vulnerability Flex mechanism; Antigua and Barbuda, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and 
Grenada have received Development Policy Loans from the CDB; and Grenada and St. Lucia 
have requested Development Policy Loans (DPLs) from the World Bank. 

45. 
The limited fiscal space, particularly in the more highly indebted countries such as 
St. Kitts and Nevis, has encouraged them to pursue policies aimed at achieving larger 
primary surpluses.  Some progress has been made on fiscal consolidation through increased tax 
revenues, primarily from strengthened tax administration, a broadened tax base, and improved 
efficiency of tax collection (e.g. through planned value added taxes (VATs) and market value-
based property taxes).  Still, further efforts are needed to continue reducing vulnerabilities. 

B. 

Protecting and Improving Human Capital 

46. OECS governments aim to strengthen safety nets in order to avoid potential declines 
in living standards while maintaining and improving investments in human capital.  They 
also aim to strengthen the resilience of their societies by improving the quality and relevance of 
education, the capacities of health systems to address the growing burden of non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs), and the efficiency of social expenditures. 

47. OECS governments recognize the inadequacy of their existing safety net programs 
which, according to Bank analytical work, are characterized by fragmentation and lack of 
coordination between agencies; inadequate targeting, resulting in duplication as well as gaps in 
coverage; and inadequate implementation capacity, management information systems, and 
accountability mechanisms.  As part of their response to the global crisis, they have decided to 
undertake policy reforms with a view to strengthening social safety nets―one part of the broader 
spectrum of social protection programs that attract support from many donors, including the 
Bank, CDB, DfID, EU, OAS and UNIFEM and UNICEF.   

48. 
Although primary and secondary enrollments have increased and primary level 
teaching materials and curricula have been standardized, education quality, relevance and 
efficiency continue to be a challenge.  Literacy and numeracy remain low.  High youth 
unemployment and skills shortages indicate a disconnect between supply of skills and labor 
market demands that are a result of several competing factors: (a) a shortage of qualified teachers; 
(b) poorly developed early childhood education systems; (c) low enrollment at tertiary levels; and 
(d) inability of education and training programs to adapt in a timely manner to changing labor 
market needs.  At 6.8% of GDP, education already receives substantial resources, so the margin 
for increase is limited and its increasingly diverse needs will therefore have to be met through 
improved efficiency.  Recognizing these challenges, OECS countries have developed plans to 
improve the quality and relevance of their education systems, which receive strong donor support 

16 

 
from the Bank, CDB, CIDA, EU, IDB, OAS, and USAID with interventions spanning the range 
from support to basic education and student loans to skills training aimed at preparing youth for 
the workforce.  

49. OECS governments have been pre-occupied with identifying ways of delivering 
quality, cost-effective health services more efficiently.  The incidence of non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cancer, strokes and 
coronary disease has been rapidly increasing.  NCDs are not only now the major cause of death, 
but also account for a growing portion of health spending.  If this trend continues, it could 
threaten the sustainability of OECS’ health systems.  Against this background, OECS 
governments recently agreed to upgrade their health management information systems (HMIS) as 
an effective means of strengthening their healthcare systems overall and, in addition, to prepare a 
sub-regional strategic plan for HMIS by 2012.18  This is a major step towards harmonizing data 
collection and reporting in the sub- region in order to better understand disease burdens and risk 
factors and thus to develop more effective prevention and treatment programs.  However, HMIS 
are only part of the solution.  OECS governments could also share capacity and pool resources by 
adopting a regional approach to common health care needs.  An important first step would be the 
elaboration of a plan and strategy to improve health services in the sub-region.  In this context, 
PAHO has been providing technical assistance including on NCDs and HIV/AIDS and the 
development of health systems.  Programs supported by the Bank, USAID and DfID continue to 
focus on HIV/AIDS and related health systems.  EU also provides support to the health sector in 
some countries.  

C. 

Reducing Vulnerability to Natural Disasters and Strengthening Environmental 
Management  

50. 
The sub-region suffers from several weather-related hazards19 and, due to climate 
change, rising sea levels.  Recently intensifying storms and rainfall concentration exacerbate 
existing hazard patterns and could put stress on water supply.  The Eastern Caribbean is also 
subject to significant geological hazards.  To lessen their impact, OECS countries have stepped 
up efforts to preserve and protect their natural environment.  In 2006, they ratified the St. Georges 
Declaration, updated in 2008, which identifies principles and guidelines for the use, conservation 
and management of the region’s natural resources.20   Key threats to its ecosystems include over-
exploitation of their resource base, loss of natural habitats, changes in water quality and quantity, 
and climate change.  If current trends continue, an estimated US$350-870 million will be lost 
annually between 2015-50 through declining fish catches, reduced tourism, and loss of shoreline 
protection associated with coral reef degradation.21    

51. 
There has been progress in some areas of environmental management, including 
governments’ commitment to major international agreements on climate change and 
environmental sustainability, adoption of key legislation to protect their natural resources, 
preparation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAP), and implementation of 
programs and activities for the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources.  But much

remains to be done, particularly in the areas of providing adequate and sustainable sources of 
financing for conservation and management of critical ecosystems; sub-regional-wide monitoring 
of critical ecosystems; policy reforms; regional and national institutional strengthening; and 
public awareness.   

52. 
Despite significant investment in response capacity and progress in understanding 
disaster vulnerabilities, OECS countries continue to face high levels of risk associated with 
natural hazards, water availability and a changing climate. In particular, aging public 
infrastructure in sectors such as health, education, water, and roads represents very high levels of 
vulnerability.  Annual hurricanes, exacerbated by the effects of climate change and combined 
with less frequent but devastating geological events, continue to be a serious drag on their 
development prospects.  To reduce the adverse effects of these natural phenomena, there is a 
continued need to rebuild damaged infrastructure with more resilient structures, to reduce the 
current vulnerability of critical 
infrastructure, and 
to supplement 
these actions with 
comprehensive disaster risk reduction measures, such as preventative maintenance, appropriate 
zoning, hazard mapping, establishment and enforcement of construction codes, disaster 
information mechanisms, and flood and landslide mitigation.  Disaster response and vulnerability 
reduction attract significant donor support from the Bank, CDB, CIDA, DFID, EU, JICA, IDB, 
and the UN system.  Interventions range from contribution to financing of the CCRIF to 
rebuilding damaged infrastructure resulting from storm surges and flooding.    

D. 

Enhancing Competitiveness and Stimulating Sustainable Growth 

53. 
Country consultations highlight the need for OECS countries individually and as a 
group to define a strategic vision for their economies reflecting the changing global 
environment and exploiting the sub-region’s comparative advantages.   Such a strategy 
would need to include growth enhancing interventions: (a) to support the development of 
possible new sources of growth such as offshore education, health and wellness tourism and 
high–end information and communications technology (ICT); and (b) to expand existing critical 
sectors such as tourism, agriculture, creative industries, and manufacturing. 22 

54. 
The sub-region requires high and sustained growth in order to address its long-term 
as well as emerging social challenges.  To move beyond its historical growth performance 
(paras. 15-18) and achieve faster growth than currently projected (Table 3), the OECS countries 
should consider implementing comprehensive reforms to address the long-term constraints to 
growth such as small economies of scale, low productivity and difficult business environment.  
Increasing regional integration through reducing trade barriers and harmonizing trade procedures 
in the OECS will be key to sustained growth.  The creation of a largely integrated regional 
economy can potentially improve allocation of resources, lower cost of inputs through greater 
competition and economies of scale for firms operating in the region.  Sustained improvement in 
total factor productivity is also an important driver of growth. Empirical studies have shown that 
fast growing economies in the world have all achieved sustained increase in total factor 
productivity and this was one of the main factors leading to convergence among economies.  
Streamlining public investment programs will be important as these programs have contributed to 
increasing indebtedness but not succeeded in crowding in private investment, in large part 
because of a lack of strategic vision and feasibility checks before new projects are introduced into 

22 OECS: Towards a New Agenda for Growth , World Bank, 2005 provides a useful analytical base.  

18 

 
                                                 
governments’ investment programs.  Additionally, out-migration and lack of skilled labor in the 
OECS has led to a slowdown in productivity growth over time.  Efforts to strengthen business 
environment, in particular, by rationalizing the investment regime and improving the delivery of 
key government services, will also be critical.  

55. One of the sub-region’s significant advantages is its strategic location at the center of 
a large regional market.  Today the scarcity of physical resources that comes with small size is 
no longer a major constraint on diversification.  With the expiration of the Cotonou preferences in 
2007 and the signing of an EU-Caribbean Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) in 2008, the 
OECS has had to adapt to an erosion of preferential access to European markets for its exports 
and the opening of its markets to EU imports.  Implementation of the Caribbean Single Market 
and Economy (CSME), of which OECS countries are members, will bring about another set of 
challenges and opportunities.  Opportunities lie in the development of the private sector’s 
competitive potential in the OECS.  IDB, DfID and CIDA are partnering in delivering the 
Compete Caribbean Program, a $3 million five-year commitment aimed at: developing and 
sustaining regional and national private sector strategies; promoting a competitive, growth-
oriented business and investment climate; and promoting innovation, productivity and the 
sustainability of key Caribbean pillars. The Bank Group, EU and CDB also support private sector 
development.   

56. 
Exploiting the OECS’ comparative advantage will require a host of improvements in 
their business environment.  These include strengthening the investment climate, expanding the 
skills base, promoting innovation and technology adoption, and improving international transport 
services and electricity supply. Feedback from consultations identified the need for a more 
nurturing environment for private sector development, particularly for MSMEs. 
 The 
governments are keen to modernize the business environment by improving regulations to foster 
much needed private sector development, streamlining administrative procedures, improving 
coordination among authorities, and generally reducing red tape for cross-border trading.  Key 
regional institutions, such as OECS’ Secretariat and the ECCB, prioritize greater sub-regional 
harmonization in new company registration, customs procedures, and paying taxes as well as 
filling regulatory gaps in credit information, and they are encouraging the OECS countries to 
work together in these areas.  

57. 
The high cost of doing business in the OECS is a significant challenge.  Knowledge 
and technology services, which are less susceptible to economies of scale and distance, are key 
factors in the economy.  Cooperation at the sub-region level has already helped to reduce the 
fixed costs of some public and private services and there is potential in others, including 
transportation.  The cost of electricity is high, which negatively impacts competitiveness.   At the 
49th Meeting of the OECS Authority in Tortola in May 2009, OECS Heads of Government 
endorsed the proposal to establish a regional energy regulator; and at the 50th meeting in Anguilla 
in November 2009, they approved establishment of an ICT Ministerial Council23 to guide policy 
making in ICT―a major area for growth, diversification, regional integration and overall 
competitiveness.  Upfront costs for infrastructure investments are high, given the small size/lack 
of scale for projects in OECS markets, and the need to import most inputs.  Furthermore, weak or 
inadequate regulatory frameworks, and often lack of transparency aggravate further the cost 
structure of infrastructure investment.  The very limited fiscal space for public investments means 

23 50th meeting of OECS Authority in Anguilla, November 2009. 

19 

 
                                                 
that private sector participation in the provision of reliable, affordable and sustainable 
infrastructure services is essential; and, building an environment conducive to private investments 
in infrastructure is a priority. 

58. OECS’ vulnerabilities in the financial sector include issues of liquidity and solvency 
among local banks and the need to strengthen the regulation of  financial institutions.  The 
global financial crisis triggered the collapse of a Trinidad-based conglomerate CL Financial and 
its subsidiaries in January 2009.  As a result, its life insurers were unable to meet their obligations 
to policyholders which amount to at least US$600 million.  These events underscore the need for 
capacity building and technical assistance to support an orderly resolution and to take 
preventative steps such as improving the supervision of non-bank financial institutions.  In 
addition, liquidity problems being faced by some local banks, credit unions and social funds are 
due to their exposure to CL Financial’s subsidiaries.  The CDB and ECCB have been working 
with the Bank Group and the IMF to find a comprehensive solution to these problems which, if 
not addressed, could destabilize the OECS’ small economies. 

59. 
The crisis also decreased the availability of credit to the private sector. This has had a 
disproportionately negative impact on microfinance institutions which, besides their familiar 
institutional capacity and credit information challenges, confront increased risk aversion by 
lending institutions.  Moreover, government presence or intervention has in some cases resulted 
in market distorting effects, thus dampening the emergence of commercial lending to micro, 
small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).   

E. 

Reducing Crime and Enhancing Citizen Security 

60. 

Unemployment, social marginalization and inequality, as well as the ineffectiveness of 
the criminal justice system, are contributing factors to a deteriorating social situation and the 
stability of the tourism sector.24  The OECS Secretariat, in collaboration with OECS’ Supreme 
Court, is addressing the growing problem of crime and violence through a series of judicial and 
legal reforms designed to improve the legal system’s efficiency and fairness.  Members of the 
Bridgetown Group25 are carrying out several interventions aimed at reducing crime and 
enhancing citizens’ security, particularly to mitigate the effects of the drug trade including inter 
alia: (a) improving national and regional institutional capacities and providing reliable funding 
for national and regional crime and security agencies; (b) implementing programs designed to 
reduce idle time and prevent crime among vulnerable and susceptible youth by engaging them in 
community and sports activities and organized programs; and (c) training staff in harm reduction, 
research, and monitoring and evaluation; and supporting non-state actors.  

F. 

Strengthening Institutional and Organizational Capacity 

61. OECS members’ civil services are permanent, providing continuity, institutional 
memory and stability at the administrative level regardless of which political party is in 

24 The OECS: Challenges to building competitiveness and resilience, OECS Secretariat, December 2004.   
25 The Bridgetown Group, an informal donor group that meets monthly to discuss issues relating to crime and 
security within the Eastern Caribbean, has three main objectives: (a) to analyze and exchange views on problems 
arising from the drug trade; (b) to make recommendations both to members and partner countries about how to 
address these problems; and (c) to co-ordinate their response to these problems particularly as regards members’ 
cooperation with partner countries.  Membership is open to EU Member States, Canada, Australia, Japan, US, OAS, 
and the UNODC.  

20 

 
                                                 
power.  However, they are also large, bureaucratic and burdensome relative to their small 
economies.  Moreover, capacity is lacking in public sector investment programming, a particular 
concern due to the need for rapid responses to natural disasters and other external shocks.  
Improving the efficiency and transparency of public expenditures and the efficient and cost-
effective delivery of public services continue to be high priorities, not least because public sector 
wages account for about half total recurrent expenditures, which have also been growing as a 
share of GDP in the last three years.  

62. 
Several studies have also highlighted inadequate public sector incentives and 
accountability, weak internal control systems and oversight bodies, and inadequate 
mechanisms for regular evaluation of policies, programs, projects and the performance of 
public agencies.  In addition, there are serious organizational capacity constraints.  Although 
OECS countries are small with extremely limited resources, the scope and size of their public 
sectors matches those of many larger countries, with mandates often exceeding their ability to 
deliver. Thus, many governments have taken steps to privatize or commercialize some of their 
functions.  

63. 
Institutions at the sub-regional level are hampered by similar challenges.  The 
ECCB’s effectiveness in coordinating monetary policy and further integrating the sub-region’s 
financial system is complemented in other areas by its counterpart coordinating body, the OECS 
Secretariat.  The latter’s mandate is: (a) to promote cooperation and economic integration among 
the Member States; and (b) to defend their sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.  
Over the years, this has evolved to include a focus on research and strategic policy advice, 
resource mobilization, and technical support.  The ECCB is an effective counterpart and robust 
champion of financial and monetary issues.  Its relative strength and the peculiar circumstances of 
its member countries have exposed it to pressure to diversify its activities beyond the core 
functions of a traditional central bank.  The Secretariat, on the other hand, struggles to manage an 
overly broad mandate because of limitations on its ability to strengthen its human resources.  
Notwithstanding these constraints, the Secretariat has made strides in implementing regional 
programs and projects in a variety of sectors, with the support of several multilateral and bilateral 
donors.  Further, given the need to achieve greater operational effectiveness and efficiency in 
implementing the OECS integration mandate and associated strategies, the Secretariat is 
strengthening its operational framework and administrative systems through the OECS 
Institutional Strengthening Project, funded by CIDA.   

64. 
The Treaty establishing the Economic Union that is to be signed in June 2010 sets up 
an entirely new OECS governing structure, including a Commission with fulltime members 
drawn from each member state.  This is an opportune moment for the OECS to create a more 
effective organization, drawing on the successes and the lessons of the past; one that is 
appropriately resourced to fully embrace the demands of an economic union.

IV. 

BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

A. 

Country Assistance Strategy, FY06-09 

Lessons learned 

65. 
The Completion Report for the last CAS concluded that it identified correctly the 
challenges faced by OECS countries and focused on the right priorities, but was too 
ambitious in three respects (Appendix 2).  First, whereas it had envisaged high case lending of 
up to $103 million, actual commitments totaled only $53 million.26  Second, the scope of reforms 
envisioned in some areas―e.g. the attempt to privatize St. Lucia’s water sector and the proposed 
conversion of key public entities to Executive Agencies―was unrealistic.  Third, the 
implementation timetable was too optimistic, with most operations requiring extensions of 
closing dates to achieve their objectives.  On the other hand, the last CAS proposed a new way of 
doing business based on three guiding principles―first, supporting regional integration and 
coordination; second, partnering and harmonizing with other development partners; and third, 
pursuing simplification and capacity building initiatives tailored to small states―and this had 
been effectively implemented.  A notable example of the first principle was the creation of the 
Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), which provides immediate post-disaster 
liquidity to governments affected by natural catastrophes.27  Other key lessons learned during 
implementation of the last CAS that have been taken into account in defining this Strategy are 
outlined in Box 1 below. 

66. Meanwhile, the recommendations of a 2007 Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) 
study of regional programs are also reflected in this Strategy.28  In particular, the Strategy 
builds on five key success factors for effective regional programs identified in IEG’s evaluation: 
(a) strong country commitment to regional cooperation; (b) realistic scope matched to national 
and regional capacities; (c) clear delineation and coordination of the roles of national and regional 
institutions; (d) accountable governance arrangements; and (e) planning for sustainability of 
outcomes at national and regional levels. 

67. 
Finally, the recently concluded Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) 
found that project designs were overall of high technical quality.  However, several projects 
rated best practice upon entry had declined to moderately unsatisfactory at closing, signaling 
challenges during implementation. 
 However, governments’ financial management and 
procurement capacity had improved compared with the previous (FY02-06) CAS.  Lessons from 
the last CPPR in addition to those raised in the Completion Report are outlined in Box 2 below. 

26 Some governments decide that it was not prudent to borrow on IBRD terms given the availability of other 
concessional resources, while others could not access IBRD funds because they had not met the established lending 
triggers.   
27 The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), the first regional joint reserve mechanism of its kind 
worldwide, was established with Bank technical assistance at the request of CARICOM.  All sixteen members of the 
CCRIF are CARICOM members or associate members. The Bank leveraged over $65 million in grant funding from 
development partners to support the CCRIF’s establishment and initial operations.  The OECS Ca tastrophe Insurance 
Project covered the entry fee and insurance premiums for up to the first three years of the CCRIF’s operations for 
IDA-eligible OECS member countries.

Box 1: Lessons from CAS FY06-09 

 Maximize impact of Bank assistance by selective interventions, building on the institution’s comparative 
advantage, closely coordinating with partners, and leveraging partner resources.    
 Employ regional/multi-country approach to lending, with flexibility in implementation at country level 
to enable tailoring of projects to specific circumstances.  Economies of scale in preparation, particularly 
where high technical skills needed, and benefits of deeper integration of small economies continue to 
justify regional approaches.   
 Pay special attention to understanding local political economy, working with governments, donors and 
civil societies to build broad-based consensus before proceeding with reforms involving policy change. 
 Strengthen sub-regional institutions to enable them to champion initiatives and better facilitate 
definition and implementation of  sub-regional agenda. 
 Simplify projects, particularly implementation and procurement arrangements, to reflect specific 
circumstances of small economies and regional/multi-country projects, thereby enhancing prospects for 
smooth implementation in an environment where institutional capacity is limited. 

 

Improve data collection and analysis to strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity as basis 
ultimately for evidence-based  policy making.  
 Successful interventions are characterized by close Bank staff involvement in all aspects of project 
design and implementation, strong and close working relationships with government and other donor 
counterparts, and multiple instruments―for example analytical work preceding investment lending to 
address the challenges identified. 

 

IFC opportunities for successful engagements are enhanced by improved country knowledge , 
increased regional presence to improve responsiveness to emerging challenges, and in-country advisory 
services to improve the business climate and the capacity of firms to engage.   

Box 2: Lessons from the CPPR 2009

 

Alignment between CAS and country electoral cycles:  Since OECS countries’ election cycles are not 
harmonized, governments may change during a CAS period.  Elections and particularly changes in 
government tend to slow project implementation. Further, a new government’s policies may not be 
adequately captured within an existing sub-regional strategy and the Bank could be perceived as 
unresponsive.   

Challenges of small size:  Scarcity of skilled civil servants means that the same people are required to 
manage projects in addition to their usual demanding dut ies.  It is also difficult to find qualified persons to 
staff project coordinating units (PCUs) and there is a very small pool of consultants and firms from which 
to procure goods and services making competitive procurement requirements difficult to comply with.     

Design and supervision of sub-regional (as opposed to multi-country) projects: Regional projects 
require similarly high priority, readiness and consensus on the distribution of costs and benefits across all 
participating countries.  Thus, it is crucial during both design and implementation that Bank teams extend 
their engagement beyond PCUs to involve a range of stakeholders in consultations and public awareness 
efforts to build broad-based commitment to project objectives.    

Adaptable Program Loan Instrument (APL): The APL has become the instrument of choice for regional 
or multi-country interventions, because of the flexibility for countries to join once they have achieved the 
necessary level of preparation to effectively carry out implementat ion.  However, two challenges remain.  
First, defining the project in a way that permits country level customization.  Second, the risk that other 
countries never join the program or are very late in doing so, which can reduce, even eliminate the cross -
benefits once the project is implemented in multiple countries simultaneously, as well as the cost 
effectiveness of Bank preparation and supervision.    

Coordination and harmonization with development partners : Successful interventions include Bank 
administered trust funds which stand alone or which co-finance Bank-funded projects, such as the Grenada 
Hurricane Ivan Emergency Recovery project―co-financed by an EU trust fund and multiple -donor 
financed technical assistance―or analytical work, such as the World Bank/United Nations Office of Drugs 
and Crime study on crime and violence in the Caribbean.

Partnerships and Participation 

i. Development partners and coordination 

68. 
The Eastern Caribbean Donor Group meets quarterly, in addition to periodic thematic 
sub-group meetings covering five areas: governance; environment and climate change; 
macroeconomic and public financial management; private sector; and poverty and social sectors.  
These meetings, held in Barbados, are coordinated by UNDP and attended by development 
partners represented in Barbados: CDB, CIDA, DfID, EU, PAHO, USAID and the UN agencies.  
The Bank also participates despite not having an office in the Eastern Caribbean. 

69. 
Development partner efforts to improve mutual collaboration have resulted in three 
joint programs planned for implementation during this Strategy.  First, a three-way Bank/ 
CIDA/IMF partnership on CIDA’s Supporting Economic Management in the Caribbean 
(SEMCAR)29 initiative where, building on experience gained under the OECS E-government for 
Regional Integration Project (EGRIP), CIDA will establish a multi-donor trust fund to be 
administered by the World Bank.  The latter will aid governments Caribbean-wide to strengthen 
public financial management, tax administration, and customs systems with technical assistance 
provided by Bank and/or IMF specialists.  Second, there is the Pilot Program for Climate 
Resilience (PPCR), where interventions will pilot new methods and scale up established ones to 
integrate climate risk and resilience into development planning and implementation and are 
strategically aligned with other donor-funded activities.  Third, UNICEF, UNIFEM and the Bank 
will undertake social safety net assessments in OECS countries as a first step towards designing 
longer-term improvements in social assistance program outcomes.  

70. 
The Bank will continue to partner and harmonize in both lending and analytical 
work to enhance development impact and reduce transaction costs, building on the results 
achieved during the FY06-09 CAS.  Coordination is particularly challenging in the OECS sub-
region because not all donors are active in all countries and assistance is delivered through 
instruments or processes that are not easily compatible.  However, donors continue to seek 
opportunities for closer and more effective collaboration (Appendix 3).  Joint missions, co-
financing, and sector-wide approaches to lending (SWAps) are possibilities that have been 
discussed during preparation of this Strategy.   

ii. Participatory process followed 

71. 
Following meetings with senior officials and key counterparts at the ECCB and 
OECS Secretariat during May-October 2009, consultations with representatives of 
governments, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations were conducted in 
each OECS country during January-February 2010.  Overall, the proposed Strategy was 
broadly endorsed.  Specifically, there was broad agreement on the Bank's diagnosis of sub-
regional challenges and priorities, on the sub-regional/multi-country approach to Strategy 
implementation, and on the principal, albeit not exclusive focus on crisis response interventions 
in the short term.  There was significant overlap in the areas of support identified in the proposed 
Strategy and the priorities identified by the participants.  IFC’s presentation stimulated much 

29 Expected to be implemented in two phases, the first one of up to CDN$20 million for policy TA and urgent ICT 
investments (notably for tax administration) and a second phase tentatively es timated at CDN$50 million mostly 
related to ICT investments in PFM, tax and customs.

interest and discussion and there was broad agreement on the four areas planned for its 
interventions: financial markets; infrastructure; investment climate; and growth sectors, including 
sustainable tourism (Appendix 5).  

C. 

Existing Portfolio 

72. On July 1, 2009, the Bank’s OECS portfolio comprised fifteen projects (thirteen 
loans and two GEF grants) representing a total commitment of $82.2 million, of which $41.8 
million, or 50.9%, had been disbursed (Table 4).30  The OECS disbursement ratio is 26.2%, 
compared to 24.9% Bank-wide.  However, 27% of the portfolio is considered ―at risk‖ 
representing 18.6% of total commitments, compared to (LAC) regional averages of 23% and 
12.6% respectively.  Two projects (St. Lucia Skills for Inclusive Growth and Implementation of 
Adaptation Measures in Coastal Zones) are rated ―marginally unsatisfactory‖ and the Grenada 
Public Sector Modernization Project is rated ―unsatisfactory’.  The Bank is working closely with 
the respective governments to resolve each project’s issues and to continue to improve 
implementation capacity as outlined in Box 3 below. 

Box 3: Strategies to improve Project Implementation 

 To improve the operations of Project Coordination Units (PCUs) in OECS countries, the Bank will continue 
to deliver intensive training in procurement, financial management and project management to PCU staff, 
line ministry staff and the staff of sub -regional institutions, as appropriate.  Central Tender Boards, which 
oversee their respective country’s procurement, will benefit from this training and other technical assistance 
aimed at strengthening national procurement capacity.  These activities will complement the broader public 
procurement reform already launched by OECS countries and supported by the Bank. 

 To ensure that efficiency gains in project management are achieved, the Bank will endeavor to simplify and 
streamline procedures, particularly those relating to procurement, through its team of fiduciary experts, to 
better respond to the circumstances of small states and multi -country projects.   

 To facilitate sharing of experience and application of practical tools to address the special implement ation 
challenges that arise in small states and multi-country projects, the Bank will also support the establishment 
of a network of OECS project management practitioners. 

73. 
In addition, the portfolio included trust funds totalling $16 million as at July 1, 
2009.31  These include the Grenada Post-Hurricane Ivan School Rehabilitation Fund ($14.2 
million), Links between Poverty and Environment in Four Small Island Developing States 
($332,000), OECS Catastrophe Insurance ($510,000), OECS Strengthening Institutional 
Capacity for Project Implementation  ($403,450), Chlorofluorocarbon Phase-out Management 
Plan for Antigua and Barbuda ($97,300), Dominica Growth and Social Protection Technical 

30 As of May 1, 2010, the Bank’s OECS portfolio comprised 16 projects representing a total commitment of $84.5 
million, of which $50.9 million or 60.2% had been disbursed; this includes the OECS EGRIP (St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines APL 2) in the amount of $ 2.3 million approved in December 2009. 
31 As of May 1, 2010 the following IDF Grants have been approved for the corresponding amounts: to promote 
efficiency in public expenditure (Antigua and Barbuda $310,000), (Grenada $350,000), and (St. Lucia $421,200);  for 
strengthening supervision of the non-banking financial sector ($455,000);  for institutionalizing performance, 
monitoring and evaluation in the OECS ($370,600)  and for strengthening the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
the Eastern Caribbean ($455,000).

74. 
During the last CAS, IFC engaged in three projects for a total commitment of $58.6 
million, including its first direct investment in Antigua and Barbuda and first trade finance 
operation in the sub-region. The $30 million investment in education in Antigua and Barbuda is 
expected to help diversify the local economy and contribute to local employment and 
development of service industries. An added benefit is the establishment of a new business 
relationship with an extra-regional partner.  The other two projects in St. Lucia’s financial sector 
include a trade line that has generated $8.6 million in trade finance guarantees and a $20 mi llion 
commitment to support St. Lucia’s only domestic bank in its growth strategy to improve its 
financial management and environmental and social management capacities and increase access 
to finance for local MSMEs.  IFC advisory services for the development of a regional credit 
bureau and to the Bank of St. Lucia are contributing to the strengthening of the OECS’ financial 
sector.  Most recently, Antigua and Barbuda has requested IFC support for the privatization of its 
state-owned insurance company.  The Bank Group has also provided extensive support for 
improving OECS’ investment climate through its Doing Business team. 

D. 

Proposed Partnership Strategy 

75. 
The overall thrust of the proposed FY10-14 Strategy focuses on two inter-related 
strategic objectives or pillars: 
first, building resilience; and second, enhancing 
competitiveness and stimulating sustainable growth in the medium term.  Its design draws on 
experience gained and lessons learned (paras. 65-67 and Boxes 1 and 2) and is framed by the 
following four additional factors: (a) the crippling effects of the global and regional crises and the 
need for urgent remedial measures; (b) the OECS’ continued focus on deepening regional 
integration and functional cooperation; (c) the reluctance of some countries to borrow except on 

26 

 
 
highly concessional (i.e. IDA.) terms and the relatively small IDA allocations available32; and (d) 
the Bank’s desire to focus support on addressing cross-border constraints and exploiting cross–
border opportunities. 
 The Strategy employs a regional/multi-country approach to its 
interventions with country level customization. 

76. 
The choice of sectoral and/or thematic interventions takes into account two 
considerations: (a) areas where OECS countries have requested Bank Group assistance and 
where the Bank has a comparative advantage: and (b) areas that present opportunities for 
coordination with development partners and/or leveraging their resources .  The existing 
portfolio of lending and non-lending activities carried over from the last CAS fits squarely within 
the two pillars identified.  In other words, there is significant continuity between the last CAS and 
the proposed new Strategy which are built on similar pillars and principles of engagement.  

i. Mode of Bank Engagement 

77. 
The sub-regional/multi-country approach.  The proposed FY10-14 work program will 
employ a sub-regional/multi-country approach to both lending and non-lending activities that 
produce significant cross-border benefits in areas where consistency of policies and actions add 
credibility, economies of scale or potential competition. This approach will: (a) enhance the 
overall impact and/or design and implementation of the program; (b) maximize the impact of 
scarce, specialized resources in the sub-region; (c) support OECS countries’ moves towards 
deeper sub-regional integration; and (d) permit access to a larger pool of concessional resources 
through the IDA allocation for regional activities.33  It will also improve the cost-effectiveness of 
Bank services by spreading the fixed costs of preparing or monitoring projects or programs across 
a large number of beneficiary countries.  Care will be taken in the design of multi -country 
projects to define activities in such a way as to allow for country-level customization. 

78. 
The decision to embark on a regional/multi-country program was not taken lightly 
given the reality, borne out by Bank-wide experience, that sub-regional/multi-country 
operations are inherently more risky than single country ones. 34 To mitigate the risk, sub-
regional/multi-country lending will only be pursued where: (a) the operation is grounded in: (i) 
sound analytical work; (ii) extensive and ongoing policy dialogue; or (iii) sub-regional or national 
or sector strategies/plans; and (b) the capacity of the counterpart is determined to be strong and/or 
where project implementation arrangements ensure that the needed capacity is available.  Efforts 

32 Of the six countries which this Strategy covers, four namely, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines, are eligible to borrow from IDA as well as IBRD.  
33 The regional IDA allocation can be used to finance ―regional projects‖ which are defined as operations: (a) that 
involve three or more countries, all of which need to participate for the project’s objectives to be achievable; (b) 
whose benefits, economic or social, spill over country boundaries; and (c) that provide a platform for a high level of 
policy harmonization between countries and, importantly, that are part of a well -developed and broadly supported 
regional strategy.  Projects are normally funded one third from the country envelope (subject to a cap of 20 percent of 
the annual national IDA allocation) and two thirds from the regional envelope.  A lower level of leverage could be 
employed if some project components are primarily national in scope. 
34 Research suggests that regional/multi-country projects: (a) take longer to prepare and cost nearly twice as much as 
the Bankwide average; (b) have high strategic relevance, but, in the absence of a suitable Bank instrument for 
regional lending, task teams were forced to fall back on country-based models that were found to be a major 
impediment with high transaction costs; (c) have weak implementation arrangements which were adversely affected 
by readiness and realism of the time frame for implementation; and (d) require more support from regional quality

for sub-regional development initiatives through training included as part of a project’s activities 
or performed through other means, such as targeted small grants. 

79. 
Instruments.  The Strategy will achieve its outcomes through a mix of instruments: 
development policy lending, investment lending, technical assistance, and analytical work.  Every 
effort will be made to leverage grant resources and additional donor financing to augment the 
program.  To leverage the countries’ limited resources and the Bank’s limited lending envelope, 
consideration will be given to innovative financing products such as output-based schemes or 
guarantee products which could attract private sector financing.  

Box 4: Strategic use of Trust Funds 

Trust funds will be used: 

 To promote organizational and institutional capacity-building; 

 To complement existing programs with targeted technical assistance; 

 To facilitate response: (a) in national or regional priority areas, even if 
these are not the focus areas of the RPS; and (b) to external shocks and 
emergencies; and 

 To engage in countries and/or sectors where the Bank may be constrained 
from having an active lending portfolio. 

80. 
Financing.  The available envelope (SDR 21.8 million or $32.3 million) reflects IDA 15 
country allocations for FY09-11 less resources already borrowed by each country during FY09.  
While the amount of the IDA envelope for the remaining three years of the Strategy (FY12-14) 
will not be known until end-FY11, it is assumed here that the IDA 16 allocations will be the same 
as those under IDA 15 (SDR 27 million or $41.4 million).  Thus, the volumes of lending for each 
operation reflected in Appendix 6 are indicative only.  Moreover, actual allocations will depend 
on: (a) the countries’ performance; (b) their performance relative to that of other IDA recipients; 
(c) the total resources available to IDA; (d) changes in the list of active IDA-eligible countries; 
(e) the terms of financial assistance provided (grants or loans); and (f) the amount of 
compensatory resources received for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.  Additionally, the 
indicative IBRD lending program is up to a maximum of $20 million for each OECS country for 
the period of the RPS (FY10-14), subject to country creditworthiness.  In addition to government 
demand, the indicative volume of IBRD lending is subject to IBRD’s lending capacity during the 
period of the RPS, and exposure management parameters.

Two phased approach to implementation.  Given the thrust of the Strategy and the 
limited IDA envelope, new interventions will be prioritized and designed to support macro-
economic stabilization or to protect the most vulnerable.  Additionally, operations that leverage 
significant donor resources will also be pursued.  Following a mid-term review and progress 
report, lending and analytical work in FY12-14 will be determined based on the countries’ 
performance, global economic conditions, and the outcome of the IDA 16 replenishment.

infrastructure, notably energy diversification, transportation and PPP advisory services; (c) 
investment climate (improving Doing Business indicators and promoting public-private 
dialogue); and (d) growth sectors and sustainable tourism, including linkages to local businesses, 
agribusiness, offshore medical/education services and  energy efficiency.  Further, IFC’s field -
based advisory team is now equipped not only to advise on the structure of PPPs but also to 
facilitate their implementation through investment products.    Finally, IFC is assessing the 
feasibility of creating a facility for much needed support to tourism, infrastructure and related 
industries (e.g. small & medium enterprises, agribusiness).  IFC’s work in the areas of investment 
climate and PPP advisory services is being supported by CIDA.

Pillar One―Building Resilience 

Results Area 1:  Promoting Fiscal and Debt Sustainability 

83. 
The Bank Group will contribute to achieving the following outcomes: (a) strengthening 
debt management; (b) achieving a fiscally sustainable wage bill ensuring key public services 
coverage; (c) creating closer linkages between public expenditure and development objectives 
through improved monitoring and evaluation; and (d) improved service delivery across the region 
through regionally integrated e-government services. 

84. 
 Improved fiscal and debt sustainability, enhanced efficiency and transparency of public 
spending, and more efficient delivery of public services are critical in strengthening the ability of 
OECS countries to respond to exogenous shocks―as well as laying the foundation for medium -
term growth.  Through the Grenada Public Sector Modernization Technical Assistance Credit, 
the Grenada Technical Assistance Credit, and the Dominica Growth and Social Protection 
Technical Assistance Credit, the Bank is supporting these governments’ efforts to improve public 
service delivery inter alia in tax, customs, investment promotion, as well as land and company 
registries. The OECS E-government for Regional Integration Project will not only improve 
service delivery in individual countries but also regionally, given its focus on harmonizing their 
ICT platforms.      

85. 
Through ongoing and planned analytical and advisory assistance, the Bank aims to: (a) 
recommend possible solutions to the debt overhang at the country level; and (b) to help define a 
regional approach that could be supported by OECS’ development partners.  As part of its crisis 
response, the Bank is also preparing Economic and Social DPLs to support policy reforms inter 
alia in the following areas: (a) improved governance and public expenditure management; (b) 
macroeconomic and financial stabilization, including actions to strengthen the financial sector’s 
resilience; and (c) strengthening policy coordination and economic management.   

86. 
Debt and fiscal sustainability work will be supported by technical assistance projects 
(including IDF-funded projects) designed to modernize public sector management, improve 
monitoring and evaluation, and enhance the quality of public expenditures and may also be 
supported by Debt Sustainability DPLs in the event of future unexpected external shocks such as 
adverse weather. These DPLs may also be used to repay higher interest rate commercial debt and 
support reforms linked to debt management. The SEMCAR Grant will build on the foundation 
laid by the ongoing OECS EGRIP to improve public financial management and the tax and 
customs systems.  As noted above (para. 82), IFC advisory services will help facilitate private 
sector involvement in PPPs. The goals of the Bank Group’s analytical work and technical 
assistance in the longer-term are to facilitate the regional policy dialogue, sustain commitment for 
these critical reforms, and support lending aimed at improved fiscal and debt sustainability.  Its 
activities in this area are being coordinated with the IMF, CARTAC and CIDA.  

Results Area 2:  Protecting and Improving Human Capital 

87. 
The Bank Group will contribute to achieving the following outcomes: (a) rationalized 
social safety net systems; (b) an increase in the proportion of qualified teachers; (c) a better 
skilled post-secondary labor force; and (d) improved data and understanding about the region’s 
chronic non-communicable diseases.  

31 

 
88. 
To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of social safety net programs, the Bank is 
supporting OECS governments in designing and implementing reform action plans under 
Economic and Social DPLs in St. Lucia and Grenada, the ongoing Growth and Social Protection 
Technical Assistance Credit in Dominica, and the regional Social Safety Nets NLTA which 
finances analysis, constituency building, action-planning and knowledge sharing. 
 In 
collaboration with UNICEF and UNIFEM, the NLTA will support social safety net assessments 
(SSNAs) in all OECS countries except Dominica, which already undertook a similar study in 
preparation for its Technical Assistance Credit. 
 A Strengthening Social Safety Nets 
Project/SWAp will support further consolidation and strengthening of safety net programs, using 
a results-based sector-wide approach. 

89. 
OECS countries are committed to improving the quality and relevance of education as 
well as the efficiency of spending in the sector.  With the OECS Skills for Inclusive Growth 
Projects being implemented in Grenada and St. Lucia as well as the OECS Education 
Development Projects in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the Bank is supporting 
governments’ efforts to increase the pool of skilled persons required to meet the demands of their 
labor markets.  The Skills Projects in particular seek to increase the employability of youth 
through public/private sector partnerships for demand-driven technical and life skills training. 
The BNPP Grant for Gender Equality, Making Youth at Risk Interventions Gender Sensitive in 
the Caribbean is aimed at providing clients and development practitioners with adequate gender 
sensitive instruments and policy recommendations to address the problems related to at-risk boys.  
The Bank is also providing technical assistance through the Teacher Career Path NLTA that will 
assist countries to increase the proportion of qualified teachers.  The OECS Education Sector 
NLTA will support the analysis and costing of education sector strategies to improve resource 
allocation, to strengthen the relevance of education, and to identify options for improving access 
at the post-secondary level.  The proposed IDF Grant for Improving Human Development Data 
will support efforts to improve the availability and use of data.  Education Sector SWAps, built on 
priorities established in national sector strategies under the NLTA, will streamline Bank support 
by disbursing against results defined under the sector strategies.  

90. 
IFC plans to support investment projects with strategic clients able to grow and operate in 
several markets.  In education, it will target lower income groups through the creation of centers 
of excellence and provide employment opportunities for skilled professionals.  It has also targeted 
offshore medical/education services as a growth diversification area and to provide local 
opportunities for tertiary education, including the training of doctors and nurses.  In tertiary 
education, IFC investment in distance learning programs with the University of the West Indies 
will complement the Bank-supported Caribbean Knowledge and Learning Network, a technical 
assistance program aimed at strengthening new approaches in the region’s tertiary institutions and 
coordinating currently fragmented initiatives in a regional approach. 

91. 
In health, the Bank has supported the establishment/improvement of health management 
information systems (HMIS) in OECS countries through lending for HIV/AIDS prevention.  The 
proposed Health Policy NLTA will address communicable and non-communicable diseases 
prevention and health system strengthening through better utilization of HMISs for evidence-
based policy-making.  The NLTA will also promote policy dialogue with a view to developing a 
regional strategy to mobilize and effectively use resources for health promotion and care.  In the 
outer years of the Strategy, lending in support of the health sector may take the form of multi-
sector results-based SWAps. 

32 

 
Results Area 3:  Strengthening Climate Resilience 

92. 
Given the vulnerability of OECS’ small island ecosystems, the central role of tourism in 
their economies, and their susceptibility to weather-related natural disasters, the Strategy provides 
for support for efforts to strengthen climate resilience and enhance environmental sustainability.  
Specifically, the Bank Group will contribute to achieving the following outcomes: (a) improved 
understanding of the vulnerability of critical infrastructure; (b) a reduction in the number of 
people at high risk of landslides in St. Lucia; (c) improved management of priority terrestrial and 
marine protected areas; and (d) the establishment of long-term financing mechanisms for critical 
ecosystems. 

93. 
Existing interventions that provide disaster mitigation support include: the St. Lucia 
Disaster Management II Project, the OECS Protected Areas and Associated Livelihoods Project, 
and the GEF Implementation of Adaptation Measures, which are all expected to deliver results in 
the short term.  Programs under preparation to strengthen climate resilience include: the 
Agriculture Risk NLTA which will identify measures to reduce vulnerability in the agricultural 
sector; 
the OECS Disaster Vulnerability Risk Reduction project which will enhance 
understanding of the vulnerability of key structures and increase the resilience of critical public 
infrastructure; and the global Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR), which aims to 
mainstream climate resilience in planning and investment across sectors in the four IDA-blend 
OECS countries.  The PPCR also has a Caribbean regional component which will benefit all 
CARICOM members through the work of regional institutions such as the Caribbean Community 
Climate Change Center, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, the University 
of the West Indies, and the Caribbean Institute for Metrology and Hydrology.   

94. 
The GEF-financed Sustainable Financing of Marine Areas project under preparation in 
close collaboration with The Nature Conservancy will reduce climate vulnerability by: supporting 
ecosystem-based adaptation; and establishing a regional endowment fund and national trust funds 
for the conservation of priority coastal and marine ecosystems and their monitoring.  Potential 
activities in the Strategy’s outer years include a GEF-financed Sustainable Land Use Planning 
and Management project and investments to enhance the climate resilience of energy supply 
systems by developing renewables and island interconnections through Climate Resilient Energy 
Provision.  Efforts will also be made to facilitate OECS members’ access to global funds 
available to finance climate resilience activities, including the Adaptation Fund.  

95. 
IFC’s private sector interventions stress the importance of setting and attaining 
environmental and social benchmarks both at the client and industry level as well as increasing 
energy efficiency and energy investments with lower greenhouse gas emissions. 

Pillar Two―Enhancing Competitiveness and Stimulating Sustainable Growth   

Results Area 4:  Strengthening Domestic Financial Sectors 

96. 
The Bank Group will contribute to achieving improved regulatory and supervisory 
frameworks for non-banking financial institutions.   

97. 
The Economic and Social DPLs will support actions aimed at strengthening the resilience 
of the financial sector by improving the regulatory environment The OECS Financial Sector 
Strengthening and Regulation Project will support the restructuring of the banking system and 
the strengthening of the regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions.  It will be 

33 

 
informed by the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST) and IDF grants for 
strengthening the supervision of non-bank financial institutions.  The IDF grants are a follow up 
to the Report on Standards and Codes on Auditing and Accounting completed in 2009 and focus 
on the regulatory units to be established in individual OECS countries.  The FIRST will focus on 
the insurance sector across the sub-region, complementing the objectives of the IDF grants.  Both 
areas offer opportunities for close  Bank/IFC collaboration, with the Bank focusing on regulatory 
framework and the IFC providing financing to local banks, where appropriate. In addition, the 
Bank has been providing support to the OECS to address the resolution of the collapse of BAICO 
through the BAICO Resolution NLTA.  This support is expected to continue through FY11.  

98. 
IFC plans to emphasize increased access to financial services for currently under-served 
micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) through advisory services to financial 
institutions and, where appropriate, governments.  OECS banks, like other Caribbean banks, need 
substantial institution building support as well as help for the development or implementation of 
lending for MSMEs.  The global financial crisis has underscored the need for such support, as 
many banks experienced losses resulting in part from their inadequate risk management 
strategies, business processes, operational controls, and corporate governance.  In response, IFC’s 
menu of instruments now includes advisory services for partner institutions focused on 
strengthening risk management and corporate governance.  

99. 
Establishing a regional credit bureau is one way to increase private sector access to 
capital. IFC has consulted with potential operators and relevant stakeholders, such as central 
banks or regulators, to help prepare them for the added responsibilities that a credit bureau would 
entail and is prepared to support further development of this initiative.   

Results Area 5: Improving Access to Quality Public Services 

100. The Bank Group will contribute to achieving the following outcomes: (a) a new regional 
institutional framework for energy; (b) increased access to ICT services for the general 
population; (c) public-private partnerships to assist in reducing government expenditure and 
improving services; and (d) simplified procedures for starting a business and regional trading. 

101. The OECS Regional Energy Regulator Program will establish a regional electricity 
regulator designed to reduce the cost of regulation for participating OECS countries and improve 
the quality and reliability of services.  The Bank Group’s approach will be to encourage and, if 
possible, facilitate reduced external vulnerability through diversification of energy sources away 
from fossil fuels, i.e. to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.  In this regard, the 
Bank will launch the Climate Resilient Energy Provision and the Renewable Energy and Island 
Interconnections AAA to define and implement practical steps towards energy diversification. At 
the same time, IFC plans to support private sector investments in energy (generation, 
transmission, and distribution) and other infrastructure including transport (roads, airports, ports), 
water, and telecommunications.  It will assist governments in identifying, designing and 
implementing investment projects that leverage private sector capital and expertise and achieve 
public policy objectives.  Overall, the Bank Group’s approach will be to emphasize investments 
that have a positive impact in terms of cost, reliability, and access on low income segments of the 
OECS market and that have a relatively small environmental footprint.      

102. The Caribbean Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (CARCIP) is a 
Caribbean-wide initiative aimed at increasing the availability, use and development impact of 

34 

 
regional broadband communications infrastructure:  as a pillar for the region’s competitiveness; 
as a source of employment generation and diversification; to build resilience to natural disasters; 
and overall to promote regional integration and social cohesion.   

103. 
IFC’s Investment Climate Advisory Services in the Caribbean work to promote the 
competitiveness of OECS countries by helping governments improve their business environments 
and stimulate investment through regulatory reforms that increase legal certainty and streamline 
administrative processes.  The program is carried out in parallel in various countries in order to 
generate regional synergies around reforms and improve conditions for regional integration.  
Participating countries have highlighted two main priorities: starting a business; and trading 
across borders.  Implementing these reforms is the focus of the Investment Climate in the 
Caribbean Project.  Paying taxes and registering property were mentioned as other areas of 
interest for future work.  IFC is also fostering dialogue between governments and the private 
sector and will continue consultations to identify other issues constraining competitiveness.  The 
Bank’s Investment Climate Assessment is complementary to the work of the IFC’s Investment 
Climate Advisory Services and will identify and prioritize investment climate constraints, 
benchmark reform progress, provide cross country comparisons of investment climate indicators, 
and help countries form broad consensus on priority areas for reform. 

104. 
IFC will pursue investments that address competitiveness and sustainability issues in 
tourism.  Bank Group interventions in infrastructure, access to finance, and investment climate 
will be geared mainly towards building a sustainable tourism industry.  A public-private funding 
initiative is currently under consideration.  The approach could combine IFC investment and 
advisory services, strengthened by Bank support in building government capacity and in 
regulatory reform. 

105. ECCB has agreed to partner with IFC and will support CARCIP to encourage private 
sector growth, which the ECCB sees as critical for the sub-region.  IFC is keen to partner with 
other sub-regional organizations and development partners with the objective of leveraging 
projects and avoiding duplication of effort. 

iii. Monitoring and Evaluation 

106. Monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy will be conducted at the country level through 
country systems and, at the regional level, by the entity responsible for project implementation.  
Progress will also be monitored through periodic results-based CPPRs, among other methods of 
portfolio supervision.  Results-based monitoring is particularly challenging in the OECS where 
timely data collection and their accuracy remain a problem, not least because of human resource 
and capacity constraints.  Both the CAS Completion Report and the CPPR emphasized the need 
to improve monitoring and evaluation capacity, starting with improved data collection and 
analysis for project implementation but also as a first step towards building capacity for much 
needed evidence–based policymaking.  To address these challenges, the OECS Secretariat is 
implementing a TFSCB Grant designed to introduce strategic approaches to the collection, 
compilation and dissemination of social statistics.  However, more comprehensive support is 
necessary. 

107. The Bank will foster a monitoring and evaluation culture by ensuring that baseline data 
and a results-based monitoring and evaluation system is in place in all new Bank operations.  
Further, it will continue to support capacity building together with other interested donors, for 
which purpose it will seek resources from the Bank-administered Trust Fund for Statistical 

35 

 
Capacity Building.  The Results Matrix at Appendix 1 provides the framework for results-based 
monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy. 

V. MANAGING RISKS 

108. Exogenous shocks and fiscal slippage.  Some or all OECS countries are vulnerable to 
more and more of the following exogenous risks: (a) weather-related natural events (e.g. 
hurricanes) causing major economic damage that could necessitate unforeseen public spending; 
(b) swings in international prices of key commodity imports (for example, oil); and (c) the 
possibility that recovery from the impact of the global recession may be protracted.  Delays in 
addressing fiscal imbalances through corrective measures and/or structural reforms may cause 
slippage.  While difficult to mitigate, the Strategy seeks to manage these risks through its focus 
on fiscal prudence and economic diversification through support for critical industries: 
agriculture, tourism and financial services. 

109. Debt.  Given that OECS countries’ high levels of public debt are limiting their 
development options, constraining their growth prospects, and, potentially, threatening their 
social stability,  reducing debt to sustainable levels or, at least, on a declining path is critical.  
While the Bank is developing a debt reduction strategy for the OECS and other Caribbean 
countries, its effectiveness will depend on several factors including the commitment of individual 
governments, the collaboration of other international organizations, as well as other external 
factors.  This risk is thus exceedingly difficult to mitigate. 

110. Political will.  OECS countries’ inability or unwillingness to subordinate national 
interests to regional priorities may impede collective action and, more broadly, hamper the deeper 
regional cooperation and integration process.  Specifically, there is a risk that OECS countries 
may decide not to take full advantage of this regional partnership strategy and turn to other 
sources of support that require less coordination on their part.  On the other hand, the recent steps 
towards the establishment of an Economic Union appear to signal renewed political will to 
empower regional institutions and prioritize collective action.  At this crucial transition stage, 
communication, dialogue and capacity building to empower regional change agents will help 
move the regional integration process forward and thus help mitigate this risk.  

111. 
Implementation capacity.  The development effectiveness of projects could be 
endangered if current implementation capacity is not maintained or improved at the national level 
and substantially increased at the sub-regional level.  Strategies to decrease the turnover of 
trained and experienced staff, carrying out annual project management training, and providing 
other capacity building opportunities will help mitigate this risk.

STANDARD CAS ANNEXES 

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA 

Annex 1: Country Profile 

Population: 
85,536 (2008) 
GNI per capita: US$13,620 (2008 est. Atlas methodology) 

1. 
Profile.  Antigua and Barbuda is a three-island economy (Redonda is the third) which 
accounts for about 25 percent of the combined Eastern Caribbean Currency Union GDP.  
Antigua, the largest island, has a dry climate and a large number of white sand beaches.  The 
cultivation of sugar that started in the late 1600’s was abandoned in 1969.  Aside from tourism—
the island’s most important industry—Antigua and Barbuda’s economy depends heavily on the 
service sector, particularly offshore services.  The unemployment rate is estimated at 7 percent. 
The poverty rate was estimated at 18 percent in 2006. Social indicators do not reflect the high per 
capita income.  Adult literacy attainment, for example, lags the other OECS countries.  The 2007 
UNDP Human Development Index ranks Antigua 47th, out of 182 countries. 

2. 

Political Context.  Independence: 1981  Last election: 2009.   

In March 2009, the United Progressive Party was reelected, winning 10 of the 17 available seats. 
Antigua and Barbuda has never borrowed from the Bank.  It has, however, benefited from 
economic and sector work, and regional analytical work undertaken across the OECS sub-region 
and the wider Caribbean region.   The new administration has recently made overtures to the 
donor community (including the World Bank) for assistance in the area of macroeconomic 
management.   

3. 
Economic Developments and Prospects.  Economic activity in Antigua and Barbuda is 
estimated to have declined by 6.5 percentage points in 2009, largely reflecting the impact of the 
global recession on trade and financial flows. The contraction was evidenced by a decline in 
activity in the tourism industry and the construction sector, the main contributors to GDP. Similar 
to other OECS countries, tourism revenues declined due to a sharp fall in stay-over arrivals (a 
decline of 13 percent, year-on-year, for the first three quarters of 2009), although the decrease 
was somewhat buttressed by an increase in cruise ship arrivals (a year-on-year increase of 26 
percent for the first three quarters of 2009). The decline in construction activity was driven 
primarily by a contraction in FDI, which negatively affected most of the tourism-related projects.  

The central government deficit widened substantially, with the primary deficit estimated at 6 
percent of GDP by the end of 2009. Although direct tax collections increased-reflecting stronger 
collection efforts and a move towards market-valuation-based property tax assessments- the fall 
in indirect tax revenues due to slowing economic activity more than offset this positive 
development, leading to an overall decline in tax revenue. On the other hand, recurrent 
expenditures increased substantially, primarily due to larger spending on transfers and subsidies. 
The resulting deficit was financed mainly through domestic borrowing and accumulation of 
arrears, thus adding to the already substantial debt burden. 

Total public sector debt increased by 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, explained almost 
entirely by a 10.9 percent increase in central government debt. By the end of 2009, total public 
sector debt is estimated to have increased by 15 percentage points to 108 percent of GDP.

Antigua and Barbuda’s economic prospects are heavily dependent on the pace of recovery in the 
global economy. Output is expected to continue declining in 2010, although the pace of 
contraction is likely to be slower. Construction activity is likely to be further dampened by 
severely limited fiscal space and expected reductions in public sector capital spending.

Annex 1: Country Profile:   

Population: 
73,193 (2008) 
GNI Per Capita:  US$ 4,770 (2008 est. Atlas method) 

1. 
Profile.  Dominica, the most northerly and largest of the Windward Islands, is 
predominately a lush mountainous area with plentiful water resources, excellent for cultivating 
bananas, which together with other agricultural products are the base of the economy and its 
largest source of employment.  Mainstream tourism was never developed due to the small 
number of white-sand beaches, high rainfall and poor air connections; however, given its other 
natural characteristics, eco-tourism is being promoted.  Agriculture is the mainstay of the 
economy and accounts for about 16 percent of total value added, 60 percent of total merchandise 
exports and employs 40 percent of the labor force. The unemployment rate is estimated to be 25 
percent, and the poverty rate was estimated 33 percent in 2003.  Dominica ranks 73rd out of 182 
countries in UNDP’s 2007 Human Development Index. 

2. 

Political Context.  Independence: 1978 Last election: December 2009. 

Dominica is the only commonwealth member of the OECS, and the only island with a substantial 
surviving population of indigenous people, the Caribs.  In the recent election (December 2009), 
the Dominica Labour Party won a large majority, securing 18 of the country’s 21 seats in 
Parliament. The previous government consisted of a coalition of the Dominica Labour Party and 
the minor Dominica Freedom Party. 

3. 
Economic Development and Challenges.  Dominica’s GDP growth buoyed to 3.2 
percent in 2008 from 1.8 percent in 2007 with strong growth registered in the construction sector 
and a rebound in agriculture. The latest quarterly data indicates an expansion of economic 
activity in the first quarter of 2009 relative to the same period the year before. Growth continues 
to be driven by the recovery of the banana industry from the damage incurred from Hurricane 
Dean in 2007. Banana output more than tripled year on year. Growth in construction activity 
originated both from public sector development projects like the Melville Hall Air Access 
Improvement Project and from reconstruction efforts after Hurricane Omar. Manufacturing saw a 
decline in output due to the impact of the global recession on the beverage industry. The tourism 
industry also shrank, driven by a reduction in stay-over tourists (down 8.8 percent) whose fall in 
expenditure more than outweighed the 31.4 percent increase in cruise passenger arrivals. The 
government expects tourism receipts to contract by US $18 million (3.6 percent of GDP) in 
2009. 

The central government fiscal position remains fairly strong. The IMF projects the overall 
balance to turn into a modest deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP (EC $7.6M) in FY 08/09 after 
running a 2.2 percent of GDP overall surplus in the previous fiscal year. The strong fiscal 
position of recent years has allowed the government to respond to Hurricane Omar and the 
global recession with a limited fiscal stimulus program (constrained by the level of public debt) 
centered on improving infrastructure and scaling up social assistance to the poor. This is built on 
the 2008 Growth and Social Protection Strategy, focusing on improving the investment climate 
and enhancing infrastructure. The government is committed to returning to primary surpluses of 

47 

 
3 percent starting in FY 2010/11. Nevertheless, this fiscal position depends on a high level of 
grants (11.3 percent of GDP in FY 2007/08) that is atypical for the region.  

Since the debt restructuring in 2004-05, Dominica has achieved a rapid decline in debt to GDP 
from a high of 128 percent in 2003 to 84.5 percent in 2009 through prudent fiscal policy despite 
severe external shocks. At the end of 2008, debt to GDP stood at 86.9 percent of GDP, of which 
57.6 percent was external debt and 29.4 percent domestic debt.  Assuming annual GDP growth 
of 3 percent and a primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP after FY 2009/10, the IMF projects that 
Dominica would reach the ECCB target of 60 percent of GDP by 2015, 4-5 years before the 
established objective. Although the government is implementing a moderate fiscal stimulus 
program, debt to GDP is expected to fall to 80.1 percent of GDP by end 2010. Debt levels are at 
risk of being augmented by possible contingent liabilities from the subsidiary branches of the 
failed CL Financial insurance company.

Annex 1: Country Profile  

Population: 
105,552 (2008) 
GNI per capita:  US$ 5,710 (2008 est. Atlas methodology) 

1. 
Profile.  Grenada, which includes the two smaller islands of Carriacou and Petit 
Martinique, to its north, is the southernmost of the Windward Islands.  Dubbed the ―Spice 
Island‖, Grenada was, until late 2004, the world’s second largest exporter of nutmeg and mace .  
On September 7, 2004, Hurricane Ivan—one of the strongest storms ever to strike the Caribbean 
region—passed directly over Grenada, decimating the housing stock, severely damaging the 
nutmeg plantations and inflicting significant damage on  the tourism sector.  An Organization of 
Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Secretariat assessment team estimated the damage at US$900 
million, more than 200 percent of the 2003 GDP, two thirds of which was housing stock.  
Despite high growth rates in the last decade, poverty rates increased drastically. The average per 
capita growth rate between 1998 and 2008 has been over 2 percent per year, yet it did not 
translate into a reduction in poverty. While indigent rates dropped significantly from 1998 to 
2008, the percentage of poor people increased from 32 percent in 1998/99 and reached 38 
percent of the population in 2007/08.  According to a preliminary draft of the Country Poverty 
Assessment (CPA) the unemployment rate stood at 25 percent in June 2008.  Grenada was 
ranked 74th  in UNDP’s 2007 Human Development Index out of 182 countries. 

2. 

Political Context.  Independence: 1974 Last election: 2008 

Following the Marxist military coup and subsequent US invasion in 1983, power has fluctuated 
between the New National Party and New Democratic Party, with the latter being elected most 
recently in 2008.  

3. 
Economic Developments and Prospects.  Grenada’s economic performance has been 
adversely affected by the challenging global environment.  After reaching 2.2 percent in 2008, 
economic growth is estimated to have declined to -7.7 percent in 2009. A worldwide financing 
drought has reduced the availability of funds for foreign direct investment (FDI) projects, 
including key tourism-related investments. As a result, activity in the construction sector, which 
has been a significant driver of growth in recent years, is projected to fall significantly in 2009 -
10.  Tourism arrivals and remittances are expected to decline further. Residential, tourism -
related, public-sector and private commercial activity are expected to recover slowly, with 
growth breaking the three percent mark only in 2014. The main near- and medium-term risks 
include a deeper and more protracted global slowdown, increased financial stress and larger 
retrenchment of capital inflows, and damage from natural disasters. 

Since 2004, the authorities have tried to keep the fiscal deficits under control, but it has proven 
difficult. Bold fiscal policy measures in 2006 included the National Reconstruction Levy (albeit 
at a lower level of 3 percent rather than at the originally planned level of 5 percent) and the 
automatic oil pricing mechanism to protect fiscal revenues from fluctuations in oil prices.  
However, important setbacks include fiscal slippages during 2006-07 and the first half of 2008, 
difficulties prioritizing capital spending, delays in improvements in the business climate and 
reforming investment incentives. The overall fiscal balance deteriorated from a small surplus of 
0.4 percent of GDP in 2005 to deficits of 6.1 percent of GDP in 2006, 7.9 percent in 2007, and 
5.0 percent in 2008. The path of the primary deficit was similar, going from a surplus of 3.2 

58 

 
percent of GDP in 2005 to deficits of 4.3 percent in 2006, 5.8 percent in 2007, and 3.0 percent in 
2008. Various forces have pressured the fiscal balance, including drops in external financing 
(grants), increased transfers to vulnerable groups in order to mitigate high food and energy 
prices, and wage bill pressures. The government has financed these deficits with arrears, a 
drawdown of deposits, and new debt.    

At the end of 2009, the public debt was at 122 percent of GDP which is well above the Eastern 
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) benchmark maximum of 60 percent of GDP. A substantial part 
of the external debt is multilateral and bilateral. In 2009, the central government held 87 percent 
of the external debt and 86 percent of the domestic debt. Interest payments have been low at 2.8 
percent of GDP in 2009, following a successful rescheduling of a substantial part of Grenada’s 
public debt in 2005 and 2006.  However, the debt service burden is rising now that the end of the 
grace period on restructured debt from domestic commercial banks has been reached. The 
Government has requested a further extension of Paris Club debt relief and the World Bank and 
the Caribbean Development Bank have been approached for budget support in 2009-10.

1.  
Profile.  St. Kitts and Nevis lies in the Leeward Islands.  The two islands are a federation: 
Nevis, the smaller island, has a population of 9,600, and exercises autonomy in most areas, with 
the exception of foreign, defense, and certain aspects of economic policy.  The economy is based 
on tourism and agriculture, although the agricultural sector in St. Kitts has been shrinking.  
Unemployment is the lowest among OECS member countries at 6.3 percent in 2007/08 and the 
2007 UNDP Human Development Index ranks St. Kitts and Nevis 62nd among 182 countries. St. 
Kitts has a poverty rate of 21.8 percent in 2007/08, which has fallen this decade from its 2000 
level of 30.5 percent.   

2. 

Political Context:  Independence: 1983 Last election: January 2010 

The current administration, representing the St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party, was reelected in 
January 2010.  St. Kitts and Nevis is a Federation, with a high degree of autonomy for Nevis, 
which has its own executive branch (Nevis Island Administration) and approximately one quarter 
of the federation’s population.  A number of referenda on secession from St. Kitts have been 
held, but have not passed. 

3. 
Economic Development and Prospects.  The economy of St. Kitts and Nevis contracted 
in the first quarter of 2009, after growing by 3.2 percent in 2008. Compounding the impact of the 
global recession, the federation was struck by Hurricane Omar in October 2008. Overall tourist 
arrivals decreased by 0.3 percent, with the arrivals of higher spending stay over visitors down by 
25.3 percent. The WEO of October 2009 projects a GDP decline of 2.0 percent in 2009. 

The double blows from Hurricane Omar and the global recession have had a substantial adverse 
impact on government finances. The IMF projects a worsening of the central government overall 
balance to 8.2 percent of GDP in 2009 from 3.5 percent in 2008. The primary surplus is 
projected to fall from 5.3 percent to 2.4 percent of GDP. The fiscal gap will be partially financed 
by a 5.1 percent of GDP rise in capital revenue, including the sale of government owned land. 
The government of St. Kitts and Nevis faces pressures to stimulate the economy and provide 
relief programs. However, given the exceptionally high level of public sector debt and the large 
accompanying interest payments, there is little fiscal room to respond. Actions implemented in 
the 2009 budget include tax relief for small hotels, a targeted support program for the vulnerable, 
and a moratorium on relief actions taken during the food crisis, which included the elimination of 
the consumer tax on food and a price cap on fuel. 

Since peaking at 196.5 percent of GDP in 2005, the debt to GDP ratio has fallen steadily to 177.6 
percent of GDP in 2008. In the same year, the external and domestic public debt stock stood at 
63.3 and 114.3 percent of GDP respectively. The total outstanding stock of public sector debt 
declined by 1.5 percent to EC $2,443.9 million at the end of March 2009, relative to the stock at 
the end of December 2008. This was due to a 2.3 percent reduction in the debt of the central 
government to EC $1,506.7 million, with declines in both its domestic debt (1.8 percent) and 
external debt (3.0 percent). The government’s total debt servicing cost decreased by 10.0 percent 
at the end of March 2009 and accounted for 40.9 per cent of current revenue.

Annex 1: Country Profile 

Population: 
169,960 (2008) 
GNI per capita:  US$9,190 (2008 est. Atlas methodology) 

1. 
Profile.  St. Lucia is the most densely populated of the four Windward Islands.   The 
interior of the island is mountainous, but there is more flat land than in Dominica, Grenada or St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines.  The soil is generally fertile and the banana industry (and other 
agriculture products) makes St. Lucia the biggest exporter of agricultural products among the 
OECS member countries.  The pleasant climate and the sandy beaches have encouraged the 
development of tourism, particularly in the ―honeymoon sector‖ which has become the main 
foreign exchange earner in the economy.  Despite relatively strong social indicators—the UNDP 
Human Development Index 2007 classifies St. Lucia as 69th out of 182 countries.  Twenty-eight 
percent of the population is estimated to live below the locally defined poverty line (2005/06), 
and 16.8 percent is estimated to be unemployed (2008). 

2. 

Political Context.  Independence:  1979   Last elections:  2006 

The current administration, representing the United Workers Party was returned to office in 
December 2006, gaining 11 of the 17 contested seats. The remaining seats were taken by the 
former ruling St. Lucia Labour Party.   

3. 
Economic Developments and Prospects.  St. Lucia’s macroeconomic performance has 
been hampered by a series of external shocks in recent years. While real GDP growth averaged 
over 4 percent during 2003–06, it slowed to 1.7 and 0.7 percent in 2007 and 2008 respectively. 
This deceleration in growth was mainly associated with a contraction in activity in the hotels and 
restaurants, construction, and manufacturing sectors.  Damage caused by Hurricane Dean in 
August 2007 hindered growth and impacted the agricultural sector in particular. Economic 
activity decelerated further in 2008, due to the global economic crisis and the downward 
pressures it exerted on tourism arrivals, foreign direct investment, and exports. Despite the 
January 2009 Jazz Festival mitigating the decline in tourist arrivals, tourism revenues in 2009 are 
expected to decline on an annual basis.  Tourism-related investments have slowed and big hotels 
have laid off employees. Agricultural production contracted, influenced by a decline in banana 
production, and resulting in a fall in exports.  Growth in manufacturing output was driven by an 
expansion of paper products. Remittances and FDI flows, however, are expected to continue the 
negative trends from 2008. Overall, real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 5.2 percent in 
2009. 

The Central Government’s fiscal accounts deteriorated between 2008 and 2009, due primarily to 
a 40 percent increase in capital expenditure and net lending. The overall deficit (excluding 
grants) more than quadrupled in nominal terms, widening from 1.8 to 7.8 percent of GDP. The 
primary balance (excluding grants) went from a EC$40 million surplus to a EC$111 million 
deficit. Interest payments also rose due to an increase in central government debt.  

The deterioration in the fiscal position put the public debt on an upward path, after the debt ratio 
had remained stable in 2004-2008 at around 65 percent of GDP. The ratio of public debt to GDP 
reached 77.0 percent at the end of 2009, compared to 66.0 in 2008. Most of the increase was due 
to further accumulation of domestic debt through the issuance of bonds and other securities on 

81 

 
the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM). In nominal terms, domestic debt rose by 
12 percent, while external debt increased by 8 percent due mostly to greater bilateral borrowing.

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES 

Annex 1: Country Profile   

Population: 
109,117 (2008) 
GNI per capita: US$8,770 (2008 est. Atlas methodology) 

1. 
Profile.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines consists of 32 islands.  St Vincent, the 
northernmost island, is the country's commercial and political center, accounting for 90 percent 
of both the land area and population.  The volcanic island is lush and green, its deep valleys 
cultivated with bananas, coconuts and arrowroot.  The others belong to the Grenadines, a chain 
of about 800 islets extending between St. Vincent and Grenada, which attract a large number of 
yachting tourists.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines has a poverty headcount index of about 38 
percent as of 2007/08 and an estimated unemployment rate of about 21 percent.  St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines ranks 91st out of 182 countries on the 2007 UNDP Human Development Index.  

2. 

Political Context.  Independence: 1979 Last election: 2009    

The current administration, representing the Unity Labour Party was re-elected in December 
2005.  They have been in power since 2001, when 15 years of rule by the New Democratic Party 
came to an end.  A constitutional referendum was held in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on 25 
November 2009, which would have abolished the monarchy of Saint Vincent and the 
Grenadines, headed by Queen Elizabeth II, and would have given power to the opposition. 
However, the proposal was supported by only 43.13 percent of voters in the referendum, well 
short of the required two-thirds threshold. 

3. 
Economic Developments and Prospects.  Economic activity in St Vincent and the 
Grenadines is estimated to have contracted by 1.1 percent in 2009, on the heels of less than 1 
percentage point growth in 2008.  The first quarter reported declines in the construction and 
agricultural sectors, as well as persistent weakness in tourist stay-over arrivals, although the 
latter was offset by a 55 percent increase in cruise ship arrivals. 

The central government recorded an overall deficit equivalent to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2008 
($33.3 million), down from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2007 ($53.3 million). This reduction was 
primarily the result of larger grant inflows (60.5 percent higher) and a decline in capital 
expenditure (by 7.3 percent) as some development projects were completed.  Higher expenditure 
(at 27.2 percent of GDP from 25.3 percent) was attributed to higher spending on personal 
emoluments, goods and services, and interest payments.  The increase in current revenue (to 30.2 
percent of GDP from 28.9 percent) stemmed from 10.5 percent higher receipts from taxes on 
goods and services (the VAT was implemented in May 2007), on income and profits, and 
customs duties on imports. In 2009, however, the government is expected to record a primary 
deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP.  

The authorities have made concrete efforts towards fiscal consolidation in recent years. Given 
the already tight fiscal situation characterized by high fixed expenditures, and the downward 
pressure the global economic slowdown has exerted on revenues, fiscal reform is imperative to 
create fiscal space and bring down public debt.  Both revenue and expenditure aspects are being 
targeted, including customs and civil service reforms, a medium-term expenditure framework, 
and maintaining the automatic fuel price mechanism and VAT adopted in 2008. The continuation 
of pension reforms, such as rationalizing the public pension system by integrating it with the 

95 

 
National Insurance Scheme (NIS), and demanding further increases to the contribution rate, 
increases to the retirement age, and reductions to the average replacement rate, are vital for its 
sustainability. 

The total outstanding debt of the public sector increased by 8.1 percent in 2008, reaching an 
estimated $1,110 million. This increase was spurred by a 28.8 percent increase in the debt of 
public corporations (associated with financing for the international airport project). Central 
government debt, which represented 78.3 percent of total debt, also increased (by 3.5 percent) in 
order to finance its investment program. From end-December 2008 to end-March 2009, public 
sector debt increased by 0.2 percent, reflecting an increase in the outstanding debt of public 
corporations by 2.0 percent, while central government debt fell by 0.3 percent. By the end of 
2009, debt is estimated to have reached 73 percent of GDP.

Appendix 2A: OECS CAS Completion Report FY06-09 
Country: The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States 
Date of CAS: September 6, 2005 
Date of Progress Report: June 5, 2008 
Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: FY06 to FY09 
Completed by: Violeta Rosenthal, Consultant 
Date of Report: December 2009 

A.  Introduction 

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Completion Report assesses the effectiveness of 
the World Bank Group Strategy for the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) FY06-
09 as defined in the CAS document (September 2005),  and adjusted in the CAS Progress Report 
(June 2008).  The purpose of this assessment is to identify lessons that are relevant to the design 
and implementation of the FY2010-14 CAS.  The assessment is based on a desk review of major 
reports and projects prepared and/or active during the FY06-09 period, assessments by the 
Quality Assurance Group (QAG), and interviews with relevant Bank staff, selected country 
stakeholders and main development partners.   

B.  Development Objectives 

2. 
The World Bank's Group strategy for the FY06-09 period supported two pillars: (1) 
stimulating growth and improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability by promoting 
greater social inclusion and strengthening disaster risk management.   The  CAS also sought to 
establish a "new way of doing business" with the OECS Countries by following three guiding 
principles:  (a) supporting regional integration and coordination efforts; (b) partnering and 
harmonizing in both lending and analytical work with other development partners; and (c) 
pursuing simplification and capacity building initiatives tailored to small states. 

3. 
The OECS Development Charter, endorsed by the people and Governments of the OECS 
countries, provided the overarching framework for the CAS. The Charter affirms the 
commitment of the small states of the OECS to create an economic union in order to effectively 
face the economic challenges of globalization.  In addition, the Charter states the aspirations of 
the OECS countries and outlines the general principles of a development agenda.  It does not, 
however, constitute a development strategy.  The OECS Development Strategy pre-dates the 
Charter having been published in November 2000.  It is broad in scope built around 10 major 
programs ranging from managing the external environment to detailed aspects of strategy 
implementation.  At the time of the CAS preparation, the Bank urged the OECS Governments to 
define 3 or 4 development objectives that could be supported by the donor community in a 
coordinated and harmonized fashion, but this did not take place.   

4. 
In the absence of officially sanctioned Government priorities, the CAS objectives were 
based on extensive consultation with stakeholders, substantive economic and sector analysis at 
the wider Caribbean and OECS levels, the Bank's comparative advantage and on lessons the 
bank has learned from its experience.  The CAS envisioned continued support in areas where the 
Bank had a history of successful interventions such as disaster relief and regulatory reforms in 

111 

 
 
telecommunications.  The Bank's sector work37 demonstrated, in no uncertain terms, the urgency 
of redefining a growth strategy for the OECS countries and addressing the debt burden.  
Economic integration, a new role for government and improved competitiveness based on 
comparative advantage instead of preferences were at the heart of the proposed growth strategy.  
The first CAS pillar (stimulating growth and improving competitiveness) emphasized improving 
the efficiency of the public sector, the cost-effectiveness of public utilities, and the capacity of 
the human resources base. The second pillar (reducing vulnerability) sought to protect vulnerable 
groups, particularly youth-at-risk, and to mitigate the countries vulnerability to natural disasters. 
Greater regional integration, capacity building, and donor coordination were cross cutting 
objectives. 

5. 
The CAS objectives were highly relevant to the development challenges of the OECS 
countries which, like other small-economies38, are especially vulnerable to external events, 
including natural disasters. OECS countries suffer from limited capacity in the public and private 
sectors and are facing a difficult transition to a changing world regime.  The CAS objectives 
addressed these challenges and were broadly defined to allow for flexible implementation given 
individual country differences.  The CAS Progress Report reaffirmed the relevance of the 
strategy although the lending program was adjusted to reflect the lack of progress in reducing the 
debt levels, which precluded the use of IBRD resources for some countries, and delayed project 
implementation.  The non-lending program remained on target.   

6. 
The lending program implemented under the CAS was constrained by the limited 
availability of IDA funds as there was no IBRD lending. The CAS was based on an IDA 
allocation to the OECS of $51.3 million, however, actual IDA availability was only $44.3 
million as $7 million were reallocated to other Caribbean countries to respond to natural 
disasters.  Total lending39 during the FY06-09 amounted to $43.6 million, or about half the 
lending approved during the previous CAS which had a roughly 50-50 IDA/IBRD funding mix. 
Lending was limited to IDA-eligible countries, and was concentrated on Grenada (two fifths), St. 
Lucia (over one-third), and Dominica. Minimal lending (US$0.7 million) went to St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines (see Table 1). Overall, the Bank was a relatively small contributor, providing a 
small fraction of total Official Development Assistance (ODA)40 to the OECS during the period.  

7. 
The non-lending program included five formal reports at the OECS level in the areas of 
fiduciary management, energy regulation, private sector financing, increasing domestic 
economic linkages and skills enhancement (see Table 1).  Reports geared at improving the 
business environment included Doing Business reports for the OECS as well as for individual 
countries and an OECS ROSC on Auditing and Accounting.  The sub-region also benefitted 
from Pan-Caribbean reports on trade, air transport, pension reform and crime and violence.  Non-

8. 
The last year of CAS implementation was influenced by the global financial crisis.   
OECS countries were hit hard by the financial meltdown of 2009.  Pre-existent weaknesses in the 
financial sector, debt management, public finances and social protection programs exacerbated 
the crisis fall-out and severely constrained the countries’ ability to respond. The crisis 
highlighted even more the relevance of the CAS objectives, for example, the OECS governments 
renewed their commitment to strengthening their social protection systems.  The lending and 
non-lending programs were redirected to help mitigate the effects of the crisis, for example, the 

113 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bank agreed to provide technical assistance to support the strengthening of social protections 
systems, in collaboration with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and the OECS 
Secretariat, and to extend budgetary support through development policy loans and technical 
assistance; in coordination with other development partners.   

C.  Program Performance 

9. 
This assessment is centered on the development outcomes and key intermediate 
indicators that the CAS FY06-09 intended to influence.  The CAS was an early results-based 
CAS, prepared at a time when the results approach was in its infancy and not yet fully fleshed 
out. Furthermore, it was recognized that weaknesses in data collection imposed significant 
constraints on results-based monitoring and evaluation in the OECS countries.  It was expected 
that the ongoing OECS-MECOVI IDF project and support to the Caribbean Regional Technical 
Assistance Center (CARTAC) would help improve social statistics and macroeconomic data.  
Moreover, all new Bank operations were expected to collect baseline data and help establish a 
results-based monitoring and evaluation system in each country. Therefore, while the CAS 
results matrix included a framework for results-based monitoring, comprehensive results would 
only be developed in the CAS Progress Report once the implementation of new projects had 
begun.      

10. 
Significant changes were introduced to the Results Matrix at the time of the CAS 
Progress Report (PR), which was completed almost three years after the original CAS was 
approved.  The PR concluded that the CAS’s projected portfolio and expected impact --based on 
a high case scenario of US$103 million-- had been overly ambitious.  Developing strategies for 
regional projects for six countries at varying stages of development had proven challenging.  
Furthermore, as mentioned before, there was no IBRD lending, because some Governments 
decided that it was not prudent to borrow given their high debt levels and the availability of other 
concessional resources, while others could not access IBRD funds because they had not met 
IBRD lending triggers.  As a result, the actual lending program was close to the base case 
scenario of US$53 million or half the anticipated level; and the Results Matrix was revised 
accordingly.  Overall, the changes improved the matrix as the effect was to simplify it and to 
tighten the performance indicators (particularly those linked to the first pillar).  However, the 
revised matrix excluded the critical outcome of restoring fiscal and debt sustainability and 
significantly scaled back planned interventions that were expected to contribute to the following 
outcomes:  improving efficiency in the delivery of public services; strengthening management of 
the natural environment and improving the quality, coverage and sustainability of social 
protection programs.41  Appendix 8B presents CAS PR indicators and progress to date, and a 
summary of the revised PR indicators is presented in Table 2 below.    The following discussion 
assesses the degree to which World Bank interventions contributed to the development 

41 The OECS Public Utilities Reform project that was expected to contribute to improving efficiency in the delivery 
of public services was excluded from the results matrix at the CAS PR  With regard to the outcome on reducing the 
cost and improving the services of public utilities for consumers and business, the planned OECS Infrastructure and 
Utilities Reform Investment/TA Program was recasted, based on the findings of the rel ated PPIAF study on regional 
regulation, with a narrower scope, as the OECS Regional Energy Regulator Project in the CAS PR.  As stated in the 
CAS PR, the Energy Regulator project would be focused on the establishment of a regional regulatory authority and 
establishing and enforcing incentives for diversifying energy sources.  The preparation of the OECS Regional 
Energy Regulator Project began in FY09 and is ongoing.  The planned OECS Social Protection program and the 
PRSC (Dominica) were excluded from the CAS PR results matrix.  The Dominica Growth and Social Protection 
Project is carrying out the activities envision in the original operations, though on a significantly smaller scale.

11. 
The program overall warrants a rating of moderately satisfactory.  Progress in achieving 
the goals of the CAS was uneven.  There were some notable successes with innovative 
interventions in disaster risk management, and high quality analytical work that influenced 
policy discussions (Doing Business, Private Sector Financing, Skills Enhancement, Linkages of 
Tourism and Agriculture), if not always policy formulation. However, most interventions were 
adversely affected by problems of complex design (HIV/AIDS, GEF projects), limited 
implementation capacity (HIV/AIDS and Education projects), and coordination problems 
(HIV/AIDS, Water Sector and GEF Climate), and in some instances, waning client commitment 
to reform (Public Sector Management, Water Sector TA).  Gains in social inclusion were modest 
(GSPTAC) (This rating is discussed more fully in section F of this report.)   

Goal 1. Supporting Growth and Competitiveness. 

12.  
The strategic framework for growth and competitiveness was articulated in the Bank 
report, "OECS: Towards a New Agenda for Growth" (2005), completed shortly before the time 
of the CAS FY06-09 preparation. The report convincingly argued that restoring fiscal health, or 
at least improving the fiscal stance, was critical to growth.  It emphasized the need to reduce 
government expenditures and to improve the effectiveness of public investment, recommending 
greater selectivity in public investment, improved efficiency of the public sector operations and 
―right sizing‖ the government by identifying areas that could be taken over by the private sector. 
The report was widely disseminated in coordination with development partners, particularly the 
European Union (EU), and contributed to the analytical underpinnings of budgetary support from 
the EU and the IMF to Dominica and Grenada, as well as to the design of two Bank technical 
assistance projects.  More recent Bank sector work, "OECS: Policy Note on Project Fiduciary 
Management" (2007), and non-lending technical assistance42 also support improvements in 
public expenditures management.     

13. 
Debt reduction leading to debt sustainability and restoring fiscal balance was a 
development outcome of the CAS but not of the CAS Progress Report.  Economic growth 
accelerated in the OECS region during the 2005-2007 period but fell sharply in 2008 reflecting 
the world financial crisis; the fiscal stance remained largely unchanged while debt indicators 
showed some improvement.  The public debt to GDP ratio fell steadily from 2004 to 2008, 
largely as a result of debt restructuring, but it is expected to rise again in 2009.  There was very 
limited progress in improving public expenditure and debt management. (See Table 3) 

14. 
Following the financial crisis, debt management and fiscal consolidation regained central 
stage in the Bank assistance program.  Development policy loans focusing on fiscal 
improvements for Grenada and St. Lucia are planned for approval in early FY10. Debt 
Management Performance Assessments, aimed at improving the institutional capacity for debt 
management, have been completed for St. Kitts and Nevis, Grenada and Antigua, others are 
expected to be rolled out in the rest of the OECS countries with donor funding.  Debt 
management is currently a priority of OECS governments, reflecting concerns about the impact 
of heightened rollover risks and rising interest rates on their already difficult fiscal positions.  

42 OECS: Institutional Capacity for Project Implementation , Institutional Development Grant, became effective in 
January 2009.

Financial Sector and Private Sector Development 

15. 
The CAS did not have specific financial sector goals.  The main issues highlighted in the 
CAS were the high exposure to the public sector and inadequate supervision of banks and non-
banks. The early-2009 collapse of the Trinidad-based CL Financial Group with a subsidiary in 
Grenada and of the Antigua-based Stanford International Bank with a subsidiary in St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines, underlined the need to improve regulation and enforcement.  The ECCB took 
over the Bank of Antigua and prepared model legislation to regulate non-banking financial 
institutions for the benefit of OECS countries. Further regulatory strengthening is planned. 

16. 
Private sector development was supported through sector work. The "OECS: Private 
Sector Financing Report" (November 2007), not originally envisioned in the CAS, aimed to 
identify the barriers to finance.  The report has yet to be formally disseminated; nevertheless, it 
has made substantial contributions to policy discussions within the ECCB and has helped shape 
the ECCB's private sector support agenda.  Accounting and auditing issues were addressed in a 
well received "OECS: Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) On Accounting 
and Auditing" (June 2008). The report was recently disseminated (May 2009) in a workshop co-
sponsored by the Bank, the ECCB and CARTAC.   The "OECS: Increasing Linkages of Tourism 
with the Agriculture, Manufacturing and Services Sectors" (September 2008) provides solid 
analytical foundations44 to develop a strategy to increase the local sourcing of goods and services 

43 The Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) comprises six countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, 
Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines; and two territories of the United 
Kingdom, Anguilla and Montserrat.  
44 The report includes a detailed survey of the hospitality sector and of medium and small enterprises to determine 
the purchasing patterns of the tourism industry and potential sources of local supply.  It also performs value chain 
analysis of key products.

by the tourism sector, the main economic driver of the region.  Several Doing Business reports at 
the OECS level, Small Island States, St. Lucia, Dominica and Grenada, spurred policy discussions 
at high levels of government on directions for regulatory reforms to improve the business 
environment and informed Bank and other donor assistance. Going forward, continued support to 
implement the recommendations stemming from these reports will be necessary. 

Public Sector Transformation 

17. 
At the time of the CAS preparation, the ECCB and OECS had launched a public sector 
reform agenda with Bank support.  The CAS sought to propel the agenda through a series of 
public sector modernization (PSM) projects aimed at: (i) improving human resource 
management and training in the civil service; (ii) converting public entities into executive 
agencies; and (iii) supporting greater regional coordination and integration of public services 
(e.g. pooled procurement of selected goods and services). Poverty reduction credits were 
expected to provide additional momentum to the reforms. Actual lending for public 
transformation differed markedly from that originally envisioned. Only one PSM project was 
approved, the Grenada Public Sector Modernization Project (effective April 2006), and it has 
faced considerable implementation difficulties (discussed below).  Three other projects, with 
narrower public sector management objectives, were approved during the CAS period: the 
Dominica Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance Project (GSPTAC) (effective in 
April 2007), which includes a public sector component; the Grenada Technical Assistance 
Project (TAC) (effective January 2009), which supports improvements in customs, tax 
administration, procurement and investment promotion45; and the E-Government for Regional 
Integration Project (E-GRIP)46 (effective June 2009) which supports upgrading information 
systems in core areas of public finance, as well as regional activities such as standardization of e-
government applications, e-security and legal framework. The EGRIP project was launched with 
three countries, and a fourth one (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) is expected to join in FY10. 
The Grenada TAC and E-GRIP projects have only recently become effective and therefore their 
impacts will materialize only in the next CAS period. 

18. Overall, there was very limited progress in increasing efficiency in the delivery of 
public services.  The conversion of public entities into executive agencies --a key element of 
the strategy to improve public service delivery-- was aborted. The Grenada PSM project 
supported the conversion of three government agencies (including the Supreme Court Registry 
and the National Lands Agency) to the Executive Agencies model, based on the successful 
Jamaican experience. However, the Attorney General’s concern about the constitutionality of the 
Executive Agency Act passed to facilitate the conversion has lead the government to ponder 
alternative reform models.  It is likely that the funds for this component will be reallocated to 
institutional strengthening.  In retrospect, it appears that the risk associated with reforming 
the legal framework was underestimated.  The project has scored some gains in public sector 
training focusing on the Grenada Industrial Development Corporation (the one-stop investor 
facilitator) and on the Public Sector Reform Unit.  Pooled procurement between Grenada and 

45 Both technical assistance projects are directly linked to budgetary support from the EU.  Disbursements of Euros 
4.38 million of budgetary support for Dominica took place in December 2008 out of a total o f Euros 11.8 million 
approved.  The Grenada budgetary support linked to the TAC was signed in November 2007 for a total of Euros 
12.37 million, disbursements have not yet started. 
46 The project was approved in May 2008, it took a little over a year to become effective which is not unusual for a 
regional project.  

118 

 
                                                 
at least one other OECS country has yet to take place; while discussions with St. Kitts and 
Nevis are ongoing. In Dominica, a public sector manpower assessment and a program to 
improve customs administration are underway, albeit progressing at a slower pace than 
originally anticipated.  

19. 
The GSPTAC and Grenada TAC significantly leveraged donor resources. Both are co-
financed by the EU and provide the framework for EU budgetary support.  Since its inception, 
the E-GRIP47 has enjoyed strong support at the highest level of Government.  Its design has 
benefited from stakeholders’ workshops and strong coordination with other donors. It has 
established a Regional Technical Committee and is partnering with a well-established regional 
institution, Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC)48.  This support bodes 
well for the EGRIP’s success but, as is the case with regional projects, close Bank supervision 
will be required to avoid implementation pitfalls that are common in projects with multiple 
stakeholders across multiple countries.   

20. 
Sector work and non-lending technical assistance have supported improvements in 
public financial management and public service performance. The "OECS: Project 
Fiduciary Management"   Policy Note (delivered December 2007) influenced the design of the 
Financial Management Component of the E-GRIP project and has informed the benchmarks in 
policy loans under preparation in Grenada and St. Lucia. An IDF grant, "Strengthening Project 
Implementation Capacity" (effective April 2008), implemented in collaboration with the 
Caribbean Center for Development Administration (CARICAD), is supporting improvements in 
public procurement and external auditing. The IDF grant for St. Lucia, "Improving Public 
Service Performance" (approved May 2009), aims at building capacity on wage bill management 
in times of crisis and to enhance public service performance.  

Regulatory Reform  

21. 
The CAS envisioned regulatory reforms in telecommunications, water and electricity 
sectors.  An ongoing telecommunications loan was expected to help deepen reforms in the 
telecommunications sector.  A regional technical assistance project planned for the water and 
electricity sectors to explore changes in pricing and undertake a regional and international 
benchmarking exercise was revised and its scoped narrowed at the point of the CAS PR, after 
which it was referred to as the OECS Energy Regulator Project.  Advances in each of the three 
sectors over the CAS period are discussed below. 

22. 
The outcomes of reducing communications tariffs and the costs of broadband 
services were achieved; although there was limited progress in the goal of universal access.  
An ongoing regional project, the "Telecommunications and ICT Development Project" (effective 
September 2005) sought to build on the successful liberalization of the telecommunications sub-
sector and to further strengthen the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL), 
the world’s first regional telecommunications Authority, which had been established with Bank 
support.   The project achieved two of its three objectives.  It helped consolidate the regulatory

24. 
An important lesson learned from the aborted PPP in the water sector in St. Lucia and the 
failed implementation of Executive Agencies in Grenada is that the degree of commitment to 
these reforms must be very carefully evaluated over a broad spectrum of constituents including 
high-level officials within the government as well as the opposition party and prominent figures 
outside the government.  Close coordination with other donors operating in the sector is also very 
important as well as allowing sufficient time for building consensus.  A programmatic approach 
with clearly defined milestones progressing towards such reforms may be worth considering. 

25. 
There was some progress towards the establishment of an efficient regional 
regulatory regime in the energy sector. Two pieces of sector work informed the policy 
dialogue: the ESMAP report "OECS Energy Issues and Options " (delivered February 2006), 
which maps out options for joint actions to help reduced the high cost of electricity in the region, 
and the study, "The Feasibility of Regional Cooperation in Regulation of the Electricity Sector of 
the Eastern Caribbean," (delivered January 2007), undertaken by the World Bank and the OECS 
Secretariat and funded by the PPIAF. These reports have provided the analytical basis for the 
OECS Regional Energy Regulator project currently under preparation. The OECS Heads of State 
have signaled support for the project by endorsing the principle of a regional regulator in January 
2007 and the general project concept in May 2009.   The project design is mindful of the lessons 
from the successful Telecommunications projects, namely, that it is essential to have political 
buy-in for regional initiatives which must offer substantial efficiency gains while also catering to 
specific local demands. 

Environment and Sustainable Tourism 

26. 
The CAS identified better management of natural resources as key to maintaining the 
OECS countries' competitiveness in the tourism sector and to reduce vulnerability to natural 
disasters.  During the CAS period, there was some progress in conservation and expansion of 
natural areas and in monitoring of endemic species, increased environmental awareness 
and greater involvement of civil society and private sector in the management of protected 
areas.  There was also some progress in regional cooperation through the establishment of a 
regional Project Steering Committee.  The achievements were supported by two regional projects 
funded with GEF grants, Caribbean Implementation of Adaptation Measures (effective February 
2007) and OECS Protected Areas and Associated Livelihoods (effective December 2004), with 
parallel financing from other development partners. However, the overall impact of these 
projects was weaker than anticipated. There was little progress in stricter enforcement of 
environmental regulations as an Environmental Management Project did not materialize and 
there was no progress in region-wide monitoring of water quality.   

27. 
As in other areas of Bank support, the environmental projects suffered from considerable 
implementation delays.  The GEF OECS Protected Areas and Associated Livelihoods Project 
was reviewed by QAG at entry and rated Highly Satisfactory with many elements of the design 
considered best practice.  Despite excellent design, with only one year to go before closing, only 
30 percent of the funds have been disbursed, largely because of slow progress in the poverty 
alleviation component of the project (alternative livelihoods). Despite delays, the project has 
made significant contributions by strengthening the management capacity of the OECS and 
extending the area under protection, as well as increasing the participation of civil society and 
the private sector. The project has also generated awareness of the importance of protected areas 

121 

 
through public media, workshops, leaflets, jingles and other media.50 It is likely that the project 
will require an extension to fully achieve its objectives. 

28. 
There was limited progress in adaptation to Climate Change.  The GEF Mainstreaming 
Adaptation to Climate Change (MACC) Project (closed March 2009) facilitated the creation of 
an enabling environment for climate change adaptation in the Caribbean and advanced the 
region's incorporation of climate in policy and decision making.  The follow-up GEF Caribbean 
Implementation of Adaptation Measures is supporting 3 OECS countries (St. Vincent and 
Grenadines, St. Lucia and Dominica), and aims at implementing pilot adaptation sub-projects 
that would help address the impact of climate change focusing on biodiversity and land 
degradation along coastal and near coastal areas. This project has also suffered from repeated 
delays, particularly in Dominica, where the capacity to design and implement subprojects is 
limited, but also in St. Vincent and Grenadines where there have been issues with counterpart 
funding.  Furthermore, the monitoring and institutional strengthening component is currently 
unfunded as third party funding has not materialized.  This highlights the importance of securing 
formal funding commitments at the project preparation stage. 

Goal 2. Reducing vulnerabilities by promoting greater social inclusion and strengthening 
disaster risk management 

Social Protection 

29. 
Very little progress was achieved in rationalizing and improving the efficiency of the 
myriad of social protection programs in the OECS countries.  Building on sector work, the 
CAS envisioned an OECS Social Protection Program that would: scale up community-driven 
micro-projects targeted to the poor and vulnerable; support reforms aimed at improved 
monitoring and targeting; and help rationalize existing social assistance programs into one fund.  
The Program was not developed.  Durig the CAS FY06-09 period, l ending in support of social 
protection was limited to one component in the Dominica Growth and Social Protection TAC 
which funded the establishment of a Beneficiary Identification System (BIS) to help target social 
assistance programs.  Support was provided through non-lending services, chiefly, the on-going 
IDF MECOVI grant to the OECS Secretariat aimed at building capacity to implement the survey 
of living conditions (SLC) and to analyze poverty data. The grant closed in October 2006 and a 
third IDF grant to continue supporting the collection of social data statistics has been approved.   

30. 
The Bank contributed to the dialogue on social protection and vulnerable groups through 
two Pan-Caribbean reports, "Strengthening Caribbean Pensions Reform" (delivered in May 
2008), which reviewed common pensions issues in the region and the "Caribbean Crime and 
Violence Report" (March 2007) which addressed problems of increased crime and violence at the 
regional and national levels. The Pensions report is informing the discussions of the OECS 
Pension Reform Commission led by the ECCB which has expressed interest in follow-up on 
technical assistance. The Crime report was done in collaboration with the United Nations Office 
on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and highlights the importance of reducing crime for economic 
growth.  The report also recommends youth-development initiatives and regional approaches that 
are directly relevant to the OECS countries.  The report influenced the OECS Skills Enhancement 
Report and the Skills for Inclusive Growth APL (discussed below). 

50 Important efforts in this area include a Knowledge Attitude and Practice Survey and Poverty-Environment Nexus 
study funded under the Bank Netherlands Partnership Program.  The Survey has helped sharpen the con tent and 
focus of the communications strategy supported by the project. 

122 

 
                                                 
31. 
A Bank mission that visited the region in April 2009 identified reforming social 
protection programs as a priority crisis response measure, and described the state of the social 
programs in the same terms as they had been depicted in the 2005 CAS, suggesting that little 
progress had been made in this area since 2005. Improved effectiveness of social pro tection 
programs is an objective supported by the two development policy loans (in Grenada and St. 
Lucia) currently under preparation.  

HIV/AIDS 

32. 
The CAS development objectives were to reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS and 
mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS by improving knowledge about HIV/AIDS and increase 
access to and use of prevention, treatment and care services . The indicators of progress were 
qualitative. Bank support was through on-going country and regional projects under the Multi-
Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Adaptable Program Lending (APL) for the 
Caribbean Region (Grenada - February 2003, St. Kitts and Nevis - May 2003, St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines - July 2004 and St. Lucia - January 2005) and one regional project, the Pan 
Caribbean Partnership against AIDS (effective October 2004).  Despite some improvements, 
monitoring and evaluation data continue to be weak, limiting the assessment of the extent of 
achievement of the objectives.  

33. 
Available data indicate that there was some progress in improving knowledge of 
HIV/AIDS, although the extent of the improvement cannot be quantified as planned, behavioral 
surveys have yet to be implemented. Project target indicators were not always achieved but 
significant progress was made in expanding counseling and testing services, as well as in the 
provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART).  Data also suggest that progress was made in the 
area of Prevention-of-Mother-to-Child-Transmission (PMTCT) with St. Kitts and Nevis 
consistently increasing the number of pregnant women reached; St. Lucia achieving zero 
transmission of HIV from Mother-to-Child; and St. Vincent and the Grenadines offering PMTCT 
services during pregnancy to all women.  In addition, all country projects made a committed 
effort to involve Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and non-health Line Ministries in the 
implementation of activities to effectively reach the most at-risk and vulnerable groups.  The 
projects also included the goal of enforcing a legal framework that protects the legal rights of 
persons living with AIDS.  Although this goal has yet to be achieved, all countries completed the 
legal research for new legislation, and the Pan Caribbean Partnership Against HIV/AIDS 
(PANCAP) Secretariat is developing regional model legislation, policies, tools and best 
practices.  The strengthening of the Secretariat had a positive impact on regional integration. 

34. 
The interventions were a fast-track response to the HIV/AIDS problem, designed to 
capitalize on regional synergies, to attain high visibility and stature, and to ensure broad 
participation.  The regional project was expected to leverage country-level interventions by 
addressing the limited human resource capacity available in many of the smaller countries. At 
the country level, responsibilities were split between the office of the Prime Minister or the 
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Health, in addition, there were several other 
implementing agencies including line Ministries and Civil Society Organizations.  This multitude 
of actors had the unintended effect of diffusing decision-making authority and compounding 
coordination problems.51 All the projects were restructured and extended for at least one year.  

51 This problem was particularly acute in Grenada, where in addition to the challenges that were common to the 
other HIV/AIDS projects, there was a change of government during project implementation and this project did not 

123 

 
                                                 
Some projects have been brought back on track as a result of restructuring and are expected to 
achieve their objectives (St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Lucia).  The St. Kitts and Nevis 
project used most of its allotted funds and achieved most but not all of its objectives. 52  Two 
projects merited marginally unsatisfactory ratings: the regional project with regard to the 
attainment of development objectives and the Grenada project, with respect to overall 
implementation progress. The closing date of the regional project was extended twice and it was 
restructured, even so, four years after approval (and one year after the original closing date) more 
than 30% of the funds remained undisbursed.  A second restructuring and third extension of the 
project has been recently approved and it is expected to meet its revised ob jectives within the 
extended timeframe.  

35. 
The implementation problems in the country projects can be attributed to: the diffuse 
decision-making authority and coordination issues referred to above; the availability of 
significant grant resources from other sources which came available during project 
implementation period; and the challenge of procuring certain ―big-ticket items‖ such as medical 
waste management and health information systems.    Implementing solutions for the disposal of 
biological waste was problematic in all projects. Procurement was particularly challenging due to 
the limited capacity of the implementing agencies and a very large number of low value 
procurement orders. The outcomes highlight 
the 
importance of establishing detailed 
implementation arrangements with clear definitions of responsibilities, well-defined coordination 
mechanisms, and with careful consideration given to the capacity of the implementing agencies.  

Human Capital Development 

36. 
The main issues in the education sector were low secondary completion rates and quality 
of education.  Although well funded (6.8% of GDP), the sector was considered poorly managed 
and in need of fundamental change to provide the OECS countries with the skills needed to 
compete in a global economy and to help arrest the problem of high youth unemployment.  At 
the time of the CAS there were four ongoing Education APL projects in St. Kitts and Nevis 
(effective December 2002), St. Lucia (effective January 2003), Grenada (effective January 
2004), and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (March 2005), which aimed at increasing access, 
improving the quality, efficiency and relevance of secondary education.  In December 2008, 
additional financing was approved for the Grenada project for quality-enhancing activities that 
had been scaled down due to permit funding for the rebuilding of schools following Hurricane 
Ivan.  Throughout the CAS period, the OECS countries maintained a strong support for 
education. 

37. 
The overall the impact of the four Education ALPs was modest.  The indicators of 
increasing secondary enrollment and completion rates were achieved; however, increases 
in the proportion of non-salary recurrent expenditures and in pupil/teacher ratios have not 
been achieved, although greater community involvement appears to be helping strengthen 
school management (Grenada).  The impact on quality cannot be ascertained as the CAS did 
not include an explicit quality indicator, and the quality indicator at the project level - the 
proportion of students passing standardized test - has been fraught with measurement and 
comparability problems.  Monitoring and evaluation continues to be an area of weakness and a 

enjoy the strong support of the new administration. This resulted in the project closing with 50% of its funds 
undisbursed, including US$0.3 million of IDA funds  
52 The project did not manage to establish a Medical Waste Management System nor a Health Information System. 

124 

 
                                                                                                                                                             
reliable quality results indicator still needs to be defined. All projects suffered from 
implementation delays and disbursement lags.  Education Management Information Systems 
were not implemented effectively and in St. Lucia, for example, the system experienced 
connectivity problems. Nevertheless, data collection improved in St. Lucia and St. Kitts as 
alternative data collection systems were introduced. Very little attention was given to evaluating 
the impact of the interventions, with the possible exception of St. Vincent and Grenadines where 
some quality-focused activities were subject to an impact evaluation.   The projects also included 
school construction which was completed, albeit with delays, but school maintenance policies 
are yet to be put into effect. A notable exception is St. Kitts and Nevis, where a 2009-2019 
Strategy, which incorporates a number of pilot initiatives undertaken by the project, was 
finalized at project closing.  A critical factor for the success of the project in St. Kitts has been 
the strong and steady leadership of the Ministry of Education.  Strong local leadership is 
particularly important in the education sector, where there is a multiplicity of donor interventions 
that require close coordination, and donors generally do not have a field presence in individual 
countries.    

38. 
The lack of relevant skills in the labor force had been identified as one of the major 
impediments to improving competitiveness in the OECS region.53 At the same time, the high 
youth unemployment rate among the youth was a growing social problem that contributed to 
crime and violence.  A skills enhancement project targeted at unemployed youth was conceived 
to help address these twin problems. The project was envisioned as a horizontal APL which 
would be rolled out in four countries (Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines).  The St. Lucia Skills for Inclusive Growth Project (effective December 2007) was 
the first operation to be approved and was followed by the Grenada Skills for Inclusive Growth 
Project (effective July 2009).     

39. 
The Skills for Inclusive Growth APL is an innovative program that has been informed by 
the findings from in-depth sector studies such as the Caribbean Social Protection Strategy 
(2005) and the OECS Skills Enhancement Report (2007), and by key findings from the World 
Development Report 2006 on Youth.  It supports all key CAS objectives which include 
competitiveness, alleviating vulnerability and promoting regional integration. The project 
incorporates lessons learned Bank-wide from similar projects as well as from lessons learned that 
are specific to OECS projects.   The indicators are well defined and closely related to the 
objectives.  The one area where the initial design could have been strengthened was with respect 
to monitoring and evaluation, and this area was in fact strengthened considerably in the second 
project under the program for Grenada. The St. Lucia project's last supervision rating is 
Moderately Unsatisfactory both for the achievement of development objectives and for 
implementation. Despite its excellent design, St. Lucia’s project experienced effectiveness delays 
and difficulties in filling project manager and monitoring evaluation specialist positions.   The St. 
Lucia project has also been adversely affected by the private sector's reluctance to cover part of 
the trainees’ expenses as a result of the economic downturn and unfamiliarity with paying for 
outside training. To overcome this problem, the Government of St. Lucia has decided to cover 
the co-financing contribution of the employers for the first call for proposals.  

53 The Grenada Business Climate Assessment 2004 identified skills and education of available workers as the most 
important obstacle to competitiveness. 

125 

 
                                                 
40. 
 The indicator of more than 200 unemployed youth to begin training by February 
2009 was not achieved, due to implementation delays; the first round of training in St. Lucia is 
now expected to take place in 2010. On the positive side, some progress was made in developing 
training courses including the development of a communications strategy.  Notably, the first set 
of training standards for the hospitality sector was launched. 

41. 
Analytical and Advisory Services played an important role in the education sector.  The 
OECS Skills Enhancement Report not only informed the Bank's lending, but it also informed 
lending by other donors.  The Caribbean Knowledge and Learning Network (CKLN) was 
conceptualized and launched by the World Bank in 2004 and supported by the major donors.  It 
has evolved as an institution working with tertiary education and using ICT technology and it 
enjoys continued support by the Bank and other donors including the IDB and the EU. 

Disaster Risk Management 

42. 
Disaster risk management was the most successful area of Bank intervention.  A series of 
Emergency Recovery and Disaster Relief projects were implemented largely during the previous 
CAS period. During the current CAS period, additional financing was approved for the St. Lucia 
Disaster Relief Project (July 2008).  The projects supported key infrastructure and institutional 
strengthening to respond to natural disasters.   The results were highly encouraging as all the 
interventions were rated satisfactory in terms of achieving their development objectives.  While 
there were some doubts on the sustainability of the results and inadequate monitoring, there were 
positive institutional development impacts, and in some cases (St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines), the institutional impacts were rated substantial.   

43. 
The CAS indicator of implementing a pooled financial mechanism for specified 
disaster events was achieved. The OECS-Catastrophe Insurance Project (effective May 2007) 
reduced the OECS Countries vulnerability to natural disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes) by 
allowing the countries to join the innovative Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility 
(CCRIF) and to purchase coverage against catastrophic hurricane and/or earthquake losses.  The 
Bank initiated work on a joint reserve mechanism to provide coverage for catastrophic events in 
2002 through a pilot that failed because of the OECS Countries’ unwillingness to borrow to 
cover the cost of a feasibility study.  Interest resurged following the devastation brought about by 
Hurricane Ivan in 2004. The Latin America region secured a PHRD grant to develop the 
feasibility study. The Bank team drove the process of establishing the Caribbean Catastrophe 
Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) working very closely with a team of highly skilled technicians 
from the field of finance, insurance, meteorology and risk management, and effectively 
capitalizing on the Bank's convening powers to leverage donor resources and to develop 
partnerships among the participating countries, donor community and private sector.  The CCRIF 
was established in 2007 and in the same year the OECS-Catastrophe Insurance Project 
(effective May 2007) was approved.  This project facilitated OECS Countries joining the CCRIF 
as IDA project funds covered the participation fee and not more than the first three years of the 
coverage against losses from catastrophic hurricanes and/or earthquakes for IDA-eligible OECS 
countries. There are currently 16 Caribbean Countries participating in the pool.   

44. 
The CCRIF has been an unprecedented success.  The Facility has been fulfilling its 
purpose by providing payouts to eligible countries that experience catastrophic events and in 
response to client demand, and it is seeking to offer new products such as excess rainfall 
coverage.  There have been a few events which have not yielded payouts and this caused some 

126 

 
friction with the governments in the early years highlighting the need to embark on a public 
awareness campaign among participating and the public at large.  A recent review conducted by 
the World Bank noted activities that could strengthen the CCRIF such as designing and 
implementing a communications strategy, formalizing of internal controls and commissioning 
external actuarial reviews.  In 2008, all countries renewed their policies and took advantage of a 
premium reduction (of 10%) to increase their coverage.  The finances of the facility are sound 
with a claim’s paying capacity for a 1 in 3,500 year event.  The IDA funds remaining at the end 
of 2008 were insufficient to cover the countries’ insurance premiums for the third year.  
Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines allocated funds from their 
respective budgets to pay their 2009 premiums. Due to the effects of the financial crisis, their 
participation is being paid by the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).  The countries’ financial 
commitment and the sound financial standing of the CCRIF bode well for the facility's future 
sustainability.  

45. 
The success of this CCRIF can be partly attributed to its flexibility and quick response to 
government demands.  It offers cutting-edge financial technology which the Bank is in a unique 
position to deliver by engaging and managing world experts to develop an innovative product 
that satisfies a critical development challenge.  Furthermore, Bank staff have been closely 
involved in all aspects of the project,  responding swiftly and forcefully when confronted with 
problems that, if left unresolved, could have derailed the facility, such as the misunderstandings 
about insurance coverage during the first year of operation.  Close Bank involvement and close 
coordination with donors were also characteristics of other successful disaster relief interventions 
(Disaster and Emergency Projects). 

Monitoring and Evaluation  

46. 
Despite some improvements, the lack of reliable data continues to be a major 
obstacle to quality policy design and analysis.  The problem is particularly acute with regards 
to social data.  The data problems were highlighted both in the CAS and in the CAS PR. The 
CAS PR noted that the poverty assessments were in need of updating and that it was expected 
that this would be undertaken with help from the Caribbean Development Bank.  The poverty 
assessments for Antigua and Barbuda and for St. Lucia were updated in 2007, and work on the 
other countries is ongoing with updated assessments for Grenada and St. Kitts expected to be 
finalized in 2009.   The Bank supported the collection of social data through the IDF- Support for 
Improvement of the Surveys of Living Conditions in OECS Countries (approved June 2002), also 
known as the IDF-MECOVI program for the OECS Secretariat. The grant closed in October 
2006 and is credited with raising awareness about the importance of country ownership and in 
building capacity for planning, designing and implementing surveys of living conditions.  The 
grant completion report also noted that training activities had to be conducted continuously 
because of high staff turnover. In 2006 the multi-donor Support Program for Poverty Assessment 
and Reduction for the Caribbean (SPARC) Program was launched with the objective of 
enhancing the availability and relevance of social data. 
 A follow-up IDF-Statistical 
Development for the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Secretariat (approved 
June 2009) grant with funding from the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building recently 
became operational.  Most projects included a component to set up a computerized data 
collection system.  In general, the systems ran into difficulties and did not become operational or 
the component was cancelled; due in part to procurement issues owing to the limited size of the 
markets.  This was the experience of the health and education projects.  The E-GRIP project is 

127 

 
expected to promote better use of information systems at the regional level in an integrated 
fashion. 

47. 
There has been progress in the quality of economic and financial statistics in an effort led 
by the ECCB and aided by CARTAC with support of the IMF.  It is expected that CARTAC will 
be further strengthened through the CIDA funded trust fund to be managed by the Bank.  Further 
progress in capacity building is needed to improve policy analysis and design, and will require 
sizeable technical assistance support. 

IFC Support  

48. 
Following the CAS PR, the IFC strengthened its engagement with the OECS 
countries. Although the CASs are joint Bank/IFC documents, the CAS FY06-09 contained very 
few references to the IFC and IFC activities were not well integrated with the Bank program.  
The CASPR recognized the need to work closely with the IFC to help develop a vibrant private 
sector, while acknowledging the challenges faced by IFC when operating in the OECS countries, 
namely, the small size of the economies and the resource intensive efforts required to develop 
operations in the area given the weakness of the private sector54.  IFC's strategy has been to link 
with the larger economies and regional private sector players in the Caribbean, leveraging their 
resources to maximize its impact. At the beginning of the period IFC's portfolio consisted of a 
single hotel loan in Grenada. During the CAS, IFC approved two new loans , a $20 million loan 
to the St. Lucia's largest bank and a US$30 million loan to a University in Antigua and Barbuda. 
There was also an increase in business development efforts in Grenada although new deals have 
yet to be completed. 

49. 
IFC's efforts were concentrated in providing advisory services to improve the business 
climate and access to finance. In St. Lucia IFC provided advisory services for the unsuccessful 
PPP and is assisting the Bank of St. Lucia to improve credit delivery to small and medium 
enterprises.  The Doing Business Reports, which are joint IFC-World Bank products,  have 
generated significant discussion and facilitated the policy dialogue regarding the competitiveness 
agenda. A regional Microfinance Study which includes the OECS countries is ongoing. 

50. 
As recognized in the CAS PR, the small scale of operations and the need for intensive 
direct involvement in developing and implementing deals constitutes a challenge for both IFC 
and IDA.  Overcoming these challenges with innovative approaches and by leveraging 
private/donor resources, and by close coordination between IFC and IDA and the donor 
community, will continue to be an important element of a successful strategy.  With respect to 
advisory services, IFC is well placed to provide assistance from its recently expanded presence 
in Trinidad and Tobago and by actively promoting the participation of the OECS countries in 
regional activities such as the ongoing efforts to establish a regional credit bureau.

The CAS Base Case Scenario envisioned $51.3 million of IDA lending for the four 
OECS blend countries (Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines).  A 
High Case Scenario envisioned IBRD resources plus policy lending to all six OECS Countries

(including Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis) bringing the total lending envelope to 
$103.4 million.  The actual lending program was closer to the Base Case Scenario outlined in the 
CAS program as Annex 8C which compares the base case program55 to actual lending illustrates.  
Two regional projects, five country-level investment projects and one GEF grant were approved. 
Three ongoing projects received additional funding.  Financial support was fairly evenly divided 
between regional (54%) and country level (46%) projects.  By sectors, lending was directed to 
disaster mitigation (40%), public sector modernization (32%), education (19%), environment 
(5%) and water sector (4%).  All the projects were closely aligned with the CAS objectives.  

52. 
The projects displayed a high degree of technical quality at entry. The Quality 
Assurance group reviewed three regional projects, a Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio 
(QALP) of the Telecommunication and ICT Project, a Quality Assessment of the Catastrophe 
Risk Insurance Project and the OECS Protected Areas – GEF project; several of the Disaster and 
Emergency Relief projects were also subject to QAG reviews.  The projects were consistently 
rated Satisfactory or better.  Some of the projects were singled out as examples of best practice.  
The CCRIF was praised for "technical soundness, its innovative nature, the excellent teamwork, 
and the genuinely regional approach."  The project was seen as a possible model for similar 
regional initiatives elsewhere in the developing world.  The Protected Areas project was 
reviewed at entry and rated Highly Satisfactory; this was justified because "The project reflects 
strong ownership by the Borrower, with much of the substantive work having been done by a 
technical unit within the OECS Secretariat."  Best practice elements of the project included 
detailed consultations over a period of several years with local communities, extensive 
participation in the design by other donors, and incorporation of lessons learned from a recently 
closed solid waste management project.  The task team had a strong partnership with the 
environment unit of the OECS Secretariat, and showed awareness of the potential political risks 
of the project. The Telecommunications and ICT project was reviewed at the implementation 
stage and found overall that the project was likely to meet its objectives but also found that the 
project could have benefitted from better assessment of the delays risks and inadequate 
performance indicators.  There was an evaluation of two St. Lucia projects56 by the Independent 
Evaluation Group during the period.  

Portfolio Assessment 

53. 
Project implementation , though improved, continued to be weak.  This is attributable 
to the need for continued capacity building in project management and the impact of project 
designs that did not fully take into account capacity limitations. Nevertheless , the disbursement 
ratio increased from 13% in FY06 to 19.3% in FY09, peaking at 26 on FY07. During the FY06 -
09 
period, 
projects 
in 
the 
infrastructure 
sectors 
(disaster management/water 
reform/telecommunications) and financial sector (catastrophe risk insurance) disbursed faster 
than those in education, health and public sector management.  There was also significant 
variation across countries, with Grenada having the lowest (10.6%) and Dominica the highest 
(37.5%) disbursement ratios as of May 2009.  Health (Regional HIV/AIDS) and education 

55 There are several tables in the CAS depicting the lending program, the tables are not all consistent, for example, 
an Environment Project is part of overall lending but is excluded from the table which displayed lending program by 
country and lending scenario. 
56 The Watershed and Environmental Management Project (closed December 1997) was rated Moderately 
Unsatisfactory and the Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction Project (closed October 2003) was rated 
Satisfactory with respect to attainment of development objectives.

projects (St. Vincent, Grenada) were restructured with uneven results.  Project extensions were 
frequent, particularly in Grenada.  The portfolio performance of projects in the Public Sector 
Management was problematic:  effectiveness delays plagued projects in Grenada.  Frequent 
change in project directors both in Grenada and Dominica contributed to slow implementation.   

54. 
Problems with delayed or inadequate financial statements were common; there were also 
occasional qualified statements.  This reflected in part the limited procurement, accounting and 
auditing capacity in the countries and sometimes faulty communication between the technical 
implementation unit and Project Management Unit, which is generally the unit in charge of 
financial management and often consists of only one or two people.  Modernization of 
procurement laws and capacity building in accounting and audit to be supported by an IDF grant, 
and the adoption of modern public sector management system supported by the E-GRIP, should 
help mitigate these problems. The tight fiscal situation confronted by all the countries at times 
resulted in counterpart funding problems, which was exacerbated in the aftermath of the global 
financial crisis.  The Bank and other donors responded with appropriate flexibility to enable 
continued project implementation. 

55. 
Simplification of project design, coordination and harmonization with donors are critical 
elements to facilitate project implementation.  The Project Fiduciary Management Report argues 
for continuation of the practice of consolidating the proliferation of project implementation units 
into one Project Coordination Unit which focuses on donor's procedural requirements, including 
fiduciary functions. This arrangement has worked well for the most part, although it could be 
argued that in the long-term it would be best to have overall project management mainstreamed 
within the responsible ministry. The establishment of national frameworks for the preparation, 
implementation and monitoring of capital projects will be critical. More exchanges among the 
country project staff of the member countries—such as the annual fiduciary workshops-- would 
help create a local network making project implementation less vulnerable to unexpected 
changes in any given country.     

56. 
Several projects ran into difficulties when there was a change in the political counterpart.  
Developing broader constituencies among different political factions and elements of the civil 
service, as well as with civil society would improve the robustness of project implementation.  
Also, incorporating civil society in project implementation whenever possible can help 
implement at least some project components, for example, the components of the St. Lucia 
HIV/AIDS project which were implemented by Civil Society Organizations were successful 
while the responses of line ministries was less successful.   Sub-regional projects require 
working closely with a strong sub-regional institution, such as ECCB or finding a strong regional 
interlocutor, this will be important to proceed with reforms in insurance, pensions or water 
utilities. 

57. 
Country Portfolio Performance Reviews were conducted at midterm and at the end of the 
CAS period. The reviews were chaired by the Country Officer.  

Cross-cutting Issues 

NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS 

58.  
The Bank made modest strides with its focus on: supporting regional integration and 
coordination efforts; partnering and harmonizing in both lending and analytical work with other 

130 

 
development partners; and pursuing simplification and capacity building initiatives tailored to 
small states. 

Supporting regional integration and coordination efforts  

59. 
There was progress in regional integration throughout the period.  The OECS continued 
to work towards the establishment of an Economic Union.  During the May 2009 meeting, the 
Heads of State confirmed their commitment to gaining parliamentary approval of the Union 
Treaty by June 18th of 2010.  Progress in the implementation of the Caribbean Single Market 
Economy (CSME) was slow. Most Bank projects and sector work included support to 
regional integration.  The bulk of Bank lending was for regional projects or programs (see 
Table 1 above and Annex 8C).  In most instances these project utilized the APL instrument, 
where projects for multiple countries were designed simultaneously, but countries were allowed 
to proceed at differing times according to their individual state of readiness for the project.  The 
project preparation process promoted regional integration as it typically brought regional 
stakeholders together around a common challenge and required joint work to define solutions.  
However, the fact that implementation was phased in many instances meant that the full benefit 
of regional collaboration may not have been realized at the implementation stage.  The limited 
role of the Bank in St. Kitts and Nevis and in Antigua and Barbuda complicates the design and 
implementation of regional projects. Sector work and non-lending technical assistance at the 
OECS as well as at the Caribbean level also supported regional integration (see Table 1 and 
Annex 8D).  Further, the Bank directly supported regional institutions such as the CARTAC, 
CARIDAS, PANCAP and the ECCB.  It has been less successful in strengthening the OECS 
Secretariat which is being supported by other development partners.   

60. 
The OECS Heads of State have affirmed their commitment to achieving an economic 
union by 2010 and the OECS Secretariat is in charge of implementing the process.  The OECS 
will require sizeable support to effectively fulfill this critical mandate.  The Bank can play an 
instrumental role bringing to bear its international experience in supporting integration. 

61. 
The lack of effective donor coordination continues to be a obstacle to achieving 
development results.  While there have been some recent improvements, donor assistance in the 
OECS continues to be fragmented and uncoordinated.  Past experience (during the CAS FY02-
06) indicates that it is possible for multiple donors to come together in a coordinated fashion, e.g. 
support for the Dominica structural reform program and for emergency support to Grenada 
following Hurricane Ivan, albeit in response to a crisis situation.  The Bank supported efforts to 
have better information on aid flows by setting up and managing the "Redbook Online" a web-
based information sharing platform57 for the Caribbean region.   The initiative got off to a good 
start but stopped functioning towards the end of 2007 due to lack of funding and donor 
ownership.  Since there continues to be a need for reliable data on aid flows, a more robust 
institutional structure for data collection should be found, and the UNDP and the CDB are 
exploring this.  Going forward, mechanisms to further strengthen donor coordination would 
continue to be a priority.  These efforts should incorporate lessons from past experiences which 
suggest engagement with donors in early stages of program development and close 
implementation coordination around specific areas (public sector management, education, health, 

57 The platform was launched in 2005, http://www.redbookonline.net/redbook

etc.).  The Bank continues to play an active role in promoting donor coordination, however, this 
is hampered by the lack of field presence in the donor hub, Barbados.   Donor such as the EU and 
the UNDP repeatedly call for the Bank to establish a field presence in the Eastern Caribbean. 

Partnering and harmonizing in both lending and analytical work with other development 
partners. 

62. 
The Bank succeeded in leveraging donor resources.  During the FY06-09, Bank 
managed trust funds for the OECS countries totaled US$4.9 million, and direct co-financing of 
IDA-loans was US$1 million. As participants in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance 
Facility (CCRIF), the OECS countries have also benefited from the US$65 million multidonor 
trust fund that was set up to establish the CCRIF with contributions from many development 
partners. In addition, technical assistance projects in Dominica and Grenada58 helped facilitate 
access to a significant pool of European Commission budgetary grant resources.  The E-GRIP 
project is expected to help deploy CIDA technical assistance grants.59 There continues to be 
significant undisbursed grant resources; capacity constraints appear to be particularly binding for 
disbursing EU funds.  Resources from the EU have been augmented as a result of the Economic 
Partnership Agreement (EPA) signed between the European Union and the CARIFORUM 
(which includes, among others, all OECS countries) in October 2008. There are also risks 
associated with project co-financing; in two projects60, funding from donor partners for key 
components did not materialize limiting the impact of the projects. 

63. 
The CAS recognized the need to coordinate with other donors, particularly in view of the 
Bank's lack of local presence, the modest size of the Bank's resources relative to other donors, 
local capacity constraints, and the need to deliver a harmonized strategy.  The Project Fiduciary 
Management Report61 argues that harmonization and simplification of donor policies and 
procedures needs to be pursued and expanded to include the whole donor community and the 
OECS.  Some actions can be taken at the OECS level, but the simplification of procurement 
procedures may need to be taken up by a broader forum, e.g. the Small States Task Force.  

64. 
There was partnering in sector work with other development agencies at the Pan-
Caribbean level, and the sector work at the OECS level benefitted from close collaboration 
with sub-regional institutions especially the ECCB.  The Caribbean Accelerating Trade and 
Integration Report was done in partnership with the Organization of American States (OAS).  
The OECS Increasing Linkages of Tourism with Agriculture, Manufacturing and Services Sector 
was done in partnership with FAO and the ECCB.  The Private Sector Financing Study was also 
carried out in close collaboration with the ECCB.  The A Time to Choose Report, carried out 
during the previous CAS, is an excellent example of collaboration with other institutions and 
received financial support from the EC and from the Netherlands.  The Crime, Violence and 
Development Report was prepared in partnership with the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime (UNODC). Leading Caribbean educators contributed to the OECS Skills and Work Study 
Report.   

58 Grenada TAC and Dominica GSPTAC, EC budgetary support for Dominica linked to the GSPTAC was Euro 4.38 
million disbursed and approved for Grenada linked to the Grenada TAC was Euro 11.67 million.   
59 An agreement for setting up a trust fund for approximate ly US$20 million is under consideration. 
60 This was the case for the teacher training component of the St. Lucia Education Project and for the monitoring 
component of the GEF-Adaptation to Climate Project.

Pursuing simplification and capacity building initiatives tailored to small states. 

65. 
No significant initiatives aimed at simplifying Bank procedures were undertaken.   
The APL instrument was often utilized62 as it has the advantages of reducing preparation costs 
and coordination delays by preparing a single project framework jointly with all potential 
participants but allowing each country to join the program as they became ready to do so. 
However, hoped for synergies have not materialized.  The Simplified Country Umbrella program 
which aimed at streamlining Bank procedures when dealing with small economies was never 
piloted, certain elements of the Program did not correspond to the reality in OECS countries like 
an expedited project preparation time, for example.  As such, there continues to be a need for the 
Bank to develop instruments that are appropriate for small economies, instruments that respond 
to the severe capacity constraints and other realities faced by these countries while allowing 
flexibility to respond to individual country needs. 

66. 
To strengthen the OECS’ project implementation capacity, the Bank delivered an 
intensive training program in procurement, financial management and project management.  The 
Bank’s financial management group has organized an annual one-week fiduciary training 
program in Washington that has brought together OECS local project staff; this program has 
been effective in improving capacity and in creating informal networks. An IDF Grant 
Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Project Implementation (effective January 2009), is 
funding a program developed and implemented by CARICAD to build capacity in the external 
audit and public procurement functions in the OECS. However, due to delays in grant approval, 
the training started in July 2009. Training has also taken place within individual projects, but the 
emphasis on training has varied considerably from project to project. Much remains to be done 
and project implementation training should continue to be a focus area in the next CAS. 

Internal coordination 

67. 
The Bank needs to develop an internal organizational structure that allows sufficient staff 
resources to create a core country team for the OECS countries within the limited 
lending/analytical work envelope.  The current Bank-wide organizational division may result in a 
large number of Bank staff having a marginal involvement in any given small country 
(supervising one project, for example). Greater integration and synergies with the rest of the 
Bank Group such as IFC, MIGA and WBI, could also enhance the achievement of development 
results. The World Bank Institute could assist the OECS in the areas of public-private 
partnerships and youth development.  

68. 
Results monitoring needs to be improved.  In line with the Bank’s focus on results, 
monitoring indicators should be more carefully defined and data collections systems be put in 
place.  In many instances, there are too many indicators (for example, in the health projects, 
Telecom & ICT, E-GRIP) geared towards accommodating external requirements rather than 
having a finite and focused core indicators of strategic and managerial use to the government and 
appropriate for the country concerned.  Indicators were not always closely related to the 
development goals.  Also, the evaluation of results should be improved, with the exception of St. 

62  Annex 8E sets out the ongoing projects as at July 30, 2009, of the total number of projects, there are:  2 GEF 
regional projects; 6 stand alone projects; and 6 APLs which equate 20 individual country loan agreements.

Vincent,63 the Education projects did not include evaluations to assess the impact of the 
interventions. 

Analytical and Advisory Activities 

69. 
Overall, economic sector work and non-lending technical assistance made a 
significant contribution to policy dialogue, Bank and donors’ financial support programs 
and knowledge transfer, however the impact on capacity building could not be ascertained .  
Major reports completed shortly before the CAS preparation, A Time to Choose and A New 
Agenda for Growth, were disseminated widely and formed the basis for the policy dialogue; they 
also spurred follow-up reports that had not been foreseen in the CAS. All three reports at the 
OECS level programmed in the CAS were carried out: Doing Business Reports for all the 
countries, the Skills Development and Enhancement Report, the OECS Project Fiduciary 
Management. The Doing Business reports have influenced the private sector competitiveness 
agenda being supported by the Bank and other donors.  As in other countries, local research is 
limited, thus with Bank studies are viewed as good sources of rigorous analysis to inform policy 
formulation as well as the donor programs.  Although the A Time to Choose and Towards a New 
Agenda for Growth Reports are now 5 years old, they continue to be widely referred to by policy 
makers and donors.  

70. 
The competitiveness agenda benefitted from OECS and Pan-Caribbean sector work 
which are providing the analytical underpinnings to respond to the global financial crisis.  
Several Doing Business Reports relevant to the OECS countries were carried out during the CAS 
review period: Doing Business in Small Island States (2009), Doing Business OECS (2007), and 
2009 Country Profiles for each of the OECS countries.  These reports have generated significant 
discussion and facilitated the policy dialogue regarding the competitiveness agenda; they have 
sparked demand for actions, such as the establishment of a separate company registration system,  
to improve the countries’ rankings vis-a-vis other small states and globally. The Doing Business 
Dominica was instrumental in defining the GSPTAC and the GDTAC and has helped shape the 
competitiveness agenda being supported by other partners. Other major reports included a 
"Private Sector Financing" Report completed in 2007. A highly relevant report, ―Increasing 
Linkages of Tourism with the Agriculture, Manufacturing and Service Sector (September 2008)‖ 
was done in close coordination with the ECCB and is informing the development policy loans 
under preparation.  There have been a series of widely discussed and high-quality Pan-Caribbean 
reports: "Air Transport Rationalization" which contributed to reforms in air transport, the "Crime 
and Violence" Report, "Pension Reform" and more recently, "Evolving Regional Integration and 
Trade."  These reports have contributed to the formulation of the IMF-PRGF program and to the 
Bank DPLs for Grenada and St. Lucia under preparation.  A grant to develop a harmonized trade 
system at the OECS level is expected.  The impact of the sector work could have been enhanced 
with closer involvement of local partners at the conceptual stage and more timely dissemination. 

71. 
The programmed non-lending assistance proceeded according to plan, there was 
continued support to MECOVI, and an additional technical assistance for improved social data 
collection was approved although this took place only in December 2008 and is yet to be 

63 The St. Vincent project funded impact evaluations of quality-focused activities such as teacher training, parent 
training workshops, programs in guidance, counseling and literacy and the introduction of classroom libraries and

effective. There were no instances of just-in-time technical assistance.  Annex 8D compares the 
programmed and actual Analytical and Advisory Services. 

Consultations and Coordination 

72. 
The preparation of the CAS included extensive consultation with governments, sub-
regional organizations, development partners and representatives of civil society.  The 
consultations revealed that there was a degree of skepticism, particularly from the NGO sector, 
about whether the consultations were genuine or simply pro-forma. NGO representatives 
requested greater inclusion in project design and implementation.  Consultations were also 
carried out in the preparation of the CAS PR.  Selected stakeholder input was also obtained for 
this CAS CR.  Annex 8G lists the stakeholders outside the Bank whose views were sought in the 
preparation of this report.  Additionally, the report benefited from early drafts of the Country 
Portfolio Performance Review that was being prepared simultaneously. 

E.  Overall Assessment of the Performance of the CAS 

73. 
Overall, the CAS merits a moderately satisfactory rating.  The CAS focused on the 
relevant priorities, based on the OECS Charter and sound analysis that correctly identified the 
challenges faced by the OECS countries. Although in hindsight, it appears that more emphasis on 
debt management and on building consensus on the public sector reform agenda was warranted.  
The projects were of high technical quality, if at times the goals and timeframes were overly 
optimistic with respect to Government's commitment and implementation capacity, and some 
projects suffered from insufficient attention to political economy aspects of country level 
(alignment of the project and political cycles) and regional interventions (ensuring high priority 
and consensus on the distribution of costs and benefits), and insufficient coordination with 
development partners.  The analytical work was of high quality and there was an effort to 
adequately disseminate most reports (but not all).  

74. 
Of the interventions that were expected to contribute to stimulating growth and 
improving competitiveness, significant progress was made in improving access, quality and use 
of telecommunications and modest progress was made in reducing the cost and improving 
services of public utilities for customers and businesses. However, the gains in improving 
efficiency in the delivery of public services and strengthening the management of the natural 
environment were lower than expected; because of a delay in the implementation of project’s 
approved by the Board, or decisions to eliminate certain programmed projects all together.  
Similarly, of the interventions that were expected to contribute to reduced vulnerability, there 
was virtually no progress on developing social protection strategies except through the Bank’s 
contribution to policy dialogue in this area on the basis of the Bank’s economic and sector work.  
There was modest progress in reducing the incidence and mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS 
and fostering a higher level of human capital development.  These areas are being negatively 
affected by poor data collection, delays in project implementation and indicators not being 
closely related to development goals. Progress was significant in the area of strengthening 
disaster risk management with the successful implementation of the CCRIF and prospects for the 
CCRIF’s sustainability being robust. In general, sector work influenced the Bank's lending and 
donor activities.  Some reports had limited impact, in part because of lack of dissemination or 
follow-up.  The Bank responded adequately to the financial crisis stepping up its engagement in 
debt management and accelerating the preparation of policy loans. 

135 

 
75. 
The main challenges were experienced during implementation, where some projects that 
were rated best practice at entry were rated marginally unsatisfactory at closing.  The CAS had 
attempted to address this issue by programming interventions aimed at improving project 
implementation capacity, where the full effects have yet to materialize.  While some activities 
such as the annual training program by the Bank’s fiduciary team have contributed to 
improvement, other planned actions experienced delays.  There was little progress in 
simplification of Bank procedures, including those related to procurement, and partnering with 
other development partners both in lending and sector work could have been improved, 
particularly in the social sectors.    Lack of effect donor coordination continues to be an obstacle 
to achieving development results.  There were some major successes in strengthening regional 
integration (such as CCRIF) and there are hopeful signs in other areas such as electricity.   

76. 
The Bank performance was satisfactory, particularly when viewed against the backdrop 
of the constraints imposed by the lack of a physical presence and the limited size of budgetary 
and lending resources. The Bank was responsive to Government's requests to restructuring 
projects (HIV/AIDs), to reallocate components (Grenada TAC) and to carry out studies that were 
not originally envisioned in the CAS (Private Sector Financing). In response to the financial 
crisis, the Bank redirected the lending and non-lending program to help mitigate the impact of 
the crisis. It is noteworthy that the CAS contemplated precisely the relevant areas of focus that 
were identified as priorities post-crisis and was sufficiently flexible, in terms of instruments 
prescribed, to accommodate policy lending, even though there was limited prior experience with 
the Bank’s use of that instrument in the OECS. The CASPR recognized that the CAS had been 
overly ambitious and revised the results matrix accordingly.   Close involvement of Bank staff in 
the implementation phase, particularly in the area of procurement, was a key element in the 
success of the disaster relief interventions.   Projects that coordinated closely with other donors 
attracted praise from clients.  However, the integration of other members of the Bank group 
(IFC, MIGA, WBI) in the assistance program could be strengthened.   

F.  Lessons Learned for Subsequent CAS Design 

77. 
To maximize its effectiveness, the Bank will need to be very selective in its 
interventions, building on its comparative advantage, closely coordinating with partners and 
leveraging partner resources.  While these are general considerations relevant to Bank 
operations elsewhere, they are especially important for the OECS countries because: (i) the Bank 
is a small player; (ii) the availability of substantial grant resources availab le from other donors; 
(iii) the lack of a Bank field presence;  and (iv) the severity of the human resource constrain ts 
experienced by the OECS economies. The CAS proved too ambitious in terms of the projected 
lending, scope of reforms, and timeframe for project/program implementation as most projects 
required extensions to achieve their objectives.  Although there were some improvements in 
donor coordination, this area will require continued attention given the high costs to the 
OECS states in managing assistance from multiple donors, particularly in the social sectors.  
Furthermore, the human resources constraints of the OECS countries require intense Bank staff 
involvement.  Working in partnership with a strong sub-regional institution and/or with a 
development partner with significant field presence could help ease Bank staff constraints.   

78. 
Political economy issues need special attention in the small states of the OECS. The 
problems encountered in the attempts to implement Executive Agencies, to implement a PPP in 
the water sector, and the difficulties faced by the Skills Enhancement project in St. Lucia and in 
several of the HIV/AIDS projects, reconfirms the importance of understanding the local political 

136 

 
economy and of working with government, line ministries, donors and civil society to build 
broad-based consensus before undertaking significant reforms. The timeframe needed to achieve 
consensus, particularly, for regional initiatives needs to be realistically assessed.  More attention 
should be given to aligning the project cycle with the political cycle to avoid startup delays such 
as those suffered in Grenada. 

79. 
The best example of success in the CAS period was the Catastrophe Risk Insurance. 
The Bank should continue to build on the success of interventions in disaster relief. The 
Bank has developed expertise in natural hazards management and has successfully assisted the 
OECS countries in mitigating the effects of natural disasters.  Factors that underlined the success 
include: high priority for all governments in the region, intensive involvement of Bank staff 
interacting with local officials, donors and private sector, cutting edge level of technical 
expertise contracted externally as needed, high leverage of donor resources and rapid response to 
implementation obstacles. Continuity in Bank support also contributed to a positive outcome 
both in disaster management as well as in telecommunications. 

80. 
The regional approach to lending should be continued but with greater selectivity in 
project choice and flexibility in implementation at the country level to enable tailoring 
interventions to specific country needs given the differences among the countries.  Economies of 
scale in preparation, particularly, when high technical skills are called for, and the need for 
integration of their small economies continues to provide a firm rationale for regional 
approaches.  But the difficulty of implementing regional projects (and regional components in 
horizontal APLs) should not be underestimated.  The OECS experience confirms Bank-wide 
lessons64 that successful regional programs require strong country commitment to regional 
cooperation and clear delineation and coordination of national and regional institutions (this was 
a problem in the HIV/AIDS programs). Again, special attention needs to be given to political 
economy considerations particularly, how to achieve consensus on an equitable distribution of 
costs and benefits (this has been an issue in the GEF projects). 

81. 
It is important to strengthen sub-regional institutions that can champion sub-
regional initiatives. While the ECCB is a relatively strong counterpart and an effective 
champion for financial/monetary issues, the OECS Secretariat needs to be strengthened 
significantly in order to be a more effective champion for the broader regional development 
policy agenda; particularly, in light of the OECS’ commitment to an Economic Union.  The 
tendency to want to engage the ECCB outside of its narrow mandate must be resisted.  On the 
other hand, the OECS Secretariat might benefit from a more narrowly defined mandate, given its 
resource and capacity challenges.  Continued support to other regional entities such as CARTAC 
and CARICAD will also be important.  

82. 
All projects need to give special attention to the implementation arrangements.  
Limited capacity is a characteristic of small economies and this is likely to continue even as 
capacity strengthening efforts take hold. Therefore, it will be important to conduct thorough 
project preparation clearly specifying all aspects of project implementation and keeping project 
implementation arrangements as simple as possible.  Going forward, the implementation of the 
recommendations of the Project Fiduciary Management should remain a priority.

Efforts to improve overall data collection and use of data for policy formulation 
need to continue.  The CAS needs to include a few strategic indicators and ensure that the 
arrangements for monitoring and evaluation of these indicators are in place.  Lack of baseline 
data proved a significant obstacle in assessing the impact of several interventions.  Project design 
should have a limited number of indicators and the Bank team should follow closely the ISR 
rating on data availability and the ratings on Monitoring and Evaluation. Improving their 
capacity at the project level for data collection and analysis will be ultimately more broadly 
beneficial to the OECS countries for the purposes of policy making.  

84. 
The Bank needs to develop simplified instruments and processes that are 
appropriate for small economies.  The ongoing Bank review of investment lending recognizes 
"it has become increasingly evident that much greater differentiation is needed-among borrowers, 
risks, sizes, and circumstances."65   The review offers an opportunity to address the needs of 
small economies. 

85. 
Given the small scale of operations and the need for intensive direct involvement in 
developing and implementing deals, the IFC would do well to continue to pursue innovative 
approaches, leverage private and donor resources and strengthen coordination with IDA and the 
donor community 
to bring much needed 
financing 
to 
the OECS’ private sector.

introduced under the first project facilitated 
competition which resulted in significant 
reductions in tariffs and higher service 
penetration.  The second project consolidated 
the regulatory reforms but made little progress 
in implementing a universal access

Lessons 
Continuity in support can help consolidate 
reform and reap benefits such as lower tariffs 
and increased competition.  
Time requirements for consensus building

Appendix 3: Donor Coordination 

1. 
The Bank Group’s program represents a very small portion of the total external assistance 
programs supported by a large number of development partners (See Table 3.2).  The CDB, 
CIDA, DFID, the EU, the UN system and USAID have the largest assistance program in the 
OECS and for most their individual programs are facilitated by regional offices based in Barbados. 
Over the FY06-09 CAS period, greater participation from non-traditional bilateral development 
partners, such as Japan, France, and 
Taiwan, China and Venezuela has been 
observed and this is expected to be 
continued. 

Table 3.1: 10th EDF Allocations for the OECS 

2.   The EU is the largest donor to 
the sub-region.  Next to the traditional 
project/program support, budgetary aid is 
utilized as principal instrument of country 
specific assistance 
if 
the eligibility 
criteria are fulfilled. The total amount of 
funds 
allocated 
through 
the 10th 
European Development Fund (EDF) for 
2009-2013 is €201M71 with the bulk 
amount (€165M) being used to fund 
regional integration and the implementation of the European Partnership Agreement (EPA)72. 
Table 3.1 shows the allocation and focal sectors for the EU.  In addition to the EDF allocations, 
the EU provides considerable grant funds 
through other programs, mainly Stabex73, 
Accompanying Measures to the Sugar Protocol (AMP) and the Special Framework Assistance 
(SFA)74.  

3. 
The USAID is in the planning stage of its 2011-2014 Strategy, which will be comprised 
of three areas: (i) investing in people (US$13.5M for 2010-11), with strong focus on HIV/AIDS 
and related health and education systems; (ii) economic growth (US$ 23.3M for 2010-11), 
improving business climate and focusing on youth and their preparedness for the workforce, and 
possible use of funds for energy efficiency for climate change activities; and (iii) governing 
justly and democratically (US$3M for 2011), focusing on social justice programs for young 
offenders.  

4. 
The CDB prepares individual country strategy papers for each of the OECS countries 
valid over a three year period. It supports 13 thematic areas, through policy-based lending, 
investment and technical assistance projects and grants, with recent approvals in the following 
sectors: supporting macro-economic management (St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines); infrastructure, such as the construction of a bypass road (St. Kitts and Nevis); 

71 The EU has allocated an additional €37M to Anguilla, Barbados and Montserrat. 
72 The EPA is a trade and development agreement which aims to bring the Cotonou trade regime between the EU 
and the Caribbean in compliance with WTO regulations.  Under the EPA, trade preferences will be replaced by 
reciprocal liberalization, albeit on an asymmetrical basis favoring the Caribbean. 
73 Transfers representing compensation for losses of export earnings in relation to the export of bananas to the EU. 
74 A financial mechanism aimed at assisting traditional banana producing countries of the African, Caribbean and 
Pacific Group of States to enhance their competitiveness and diversify the agricultural sector.

education through student loan (Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines); basic education (St. Lucia), and education enhancement projects (Dominica); 
private sector development through a  Port Rationalization and Development Study (St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines); and disaster response and mitigation projects (Grenada and Dominica).  
CDB is also involved with the financial sector as exemplified by the recently provided lines of 
credit for the Bank of St. Lucia and the Dominica Agricultural, Industrial and Development 
Bank.  Furthermore, although the OECS countries are not members of the IDB, they benefit from 
IDB resources as the IDB channels funds through the CDB for on-lending to OECS countries.  
Specific areas of focus of this support include regional integration, managing distributional risks 
of liberalization, addressing institutional capacity and supporting economic diversification.  
Additionally, the OECS benefits from IDB resources through a number of small grants that are 
executed on a sub-regional or regional basis.  

5. 
In the period of this RPS, the IDB will partner with DFID and CIDA in funding the 
Compete Caribbean Program which is a pan-Caribbean initiative from which OECS countries 
will also benefit.  This US$ 34 million, five year program will aim to increase: (i) donor 
harmonization and coherence, equity and sustainability of the national and regional private sector 
strategies; (ii) the efficiency and effectiveness of Caribbean governments to promote a 
competitive, growth-oriented business and investment climate; and (iii) innovation, productivity, 
value added production, sales and sustainability in key Caribbean pillars and value chains, and 
product sophistication, productivity and exports of individual firms. 

6. 
CIDA’s Caribbean Program, which includes but is not limited to the OECS countries, 
focuses on the major thematic priority of sustainable economic growth (sub-themes are public 
financial management, skills training, entrepreneurship, rule of law and disaster risk reduction). 
In public financial management, CIDA has provided C$25 million to the Caribbean Regional 
Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC, Phase 3), which provides short-term technical 
assistance and training in core areas of economic and financial management.  CIDA is providing 
C$7.2 million to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank to help its member countries better manage 
their debt stock. It will invest C$20 million in the World Bank-managed Supporting Economic 
Management in the Caribbean (SEMCAR) to strengthen government IT systems for more 
effective and regionally integrated tax, customs, budget and treasury processes. In the area of 
entrepreneurship, CIDA will contribute C$20 million to the above mentioned joint IDB-DFID-
CIDA Compete Caribbean initiative.  The Caribbean Trade and Competitiveness Project 
provides C$13.5 million to the CARICOM Secretariat to support the implementation of the 
CSME and support the work of the Office of Trade Negotiations. CIDA’s ongoing support in the 
area of disaster risk reduction includes C$20 million to capitalize the Caribbean Catastrophe 
Risk Insurance Facility, and C$20 million to support implementation of CARICOM’s enhanced 
regional comprehensive disaster risk management framework. 

7. 
Some donors have selective country focused or sector specific programs. For example, 
JICA supports Dominica in fisheries, disaster management and poverty reduction, and the OAS 
is involved with: social protection through the transfer of knowledge, skills and lessons learnt 
from the Chile Puente Program; and education in a partnership with UNESCO on higher 
education.   

8. 
On the other hand, DFID (16 projects totaling £33.68M), has focused its efforts on 
Caribbean regional projects, with a view to fostering Caribbean regional integration, in the 
following areas :  trade, disaster vulnerability and climate change, heath and crime and violence.   

155 

 
In particular, DFID is  assisting CARICOM, and other regional institutions  through sharing 
ideas and providing funds (especially disadvantaged countries) to get agreement for and 
assistance in adjusting to the Caribbean Single Market Economy and support the implementation 
of the Economic Partnership Agreement.  DFID is providing support to assist with improving 
prediction and co-ordination responses to disasters through CDERA and CCCCC; and in health, 
where it has supported the creation of a regional response to HIV/AIDS, it is supporting the 
preparation of a strategy to reduce stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV. 

9. 
Finally, the UN system’s 2005-2009 strategy, which will continue to be in effect until 
2011, outlines the following thematic areas: (a) governance reform and institutional 
development; (b) poverty reduction and social sector development; (c) capacity building for 
environment and natural resource management; and (d) risk reduction and disaster management.   
Further, UNICEF has specific involvement in education, judicial and legal reform and is looking 
into issues regarding the debt burden of OECS countries and its impact on children and youth, 
specifically dealing with fuel, finance and food.

Appendix 4: Public Debt and Debt Sustainability Analysis 

1. The OECS countries are characterized by very high indebtedness levels. Total public 
debt at end-2008 averaged at 99 percent of GDP in the OECS, with wide variation among the 
member states. St. Kitts and Nevis holds the highest ratio by far—177 percent at the end of 2008. 
St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines rank the lowest at 67 percent. The other members 
range between 87 percent and 109 percent. About half of current debt is external, but even 
domestic debt is pegged to foreign currencies by virtue of the fixed exchange-rate regime of the 
ECCU. This leaves the OECS economies highly vulnerable to external shocks, limiting 
government flexibility to engage in countercyclical fiscal policies. In addition, very high public 
debt service payments in several countries are crowding out other public and private 
expenditures.

2. The creditor composition of both domestic and external debt varies substan tially across 
countries (Table 4.1). In external debt, bilateral and multilateral debt feature prominently in 
Dominica, Grenada and St. Lucia at around 50 percent of external debt. Commercial debt is 
particularly substantial in Antigua and Barbuda, at 53.5 percent of external debt. The external 
debt holdings of non-central government bodies exceed 10 percent of total external debt in all 
countries. The domestic debt decomposition is similarly heterogeneous.

*No creditor breakdown is available for restructured and un -restructured domestic bonds. 

3. The driving forces behind the rise in debt have been fiscal loosening and external 
factors (many of the latter linked to natural disasters). Four characteristics stand out in 
looking at the contributions to debt ratios since 1999 (Table 4.2 below).  First, the contributions 
from primary fiscal deficits have largely been positive, indicating that governments have been 
unable to consistently record primary surpluses. Second, high interest payments—driven by the 
large debt overhang and substantial share of commercial debt—also constraint fiscal space by 
imposing a significant burden on government budgets. Third, moderate real growth across the 
region has kept the debt from rising even higher, as did grants in Dominica and Grenada. Fourth, 
debt-creating exogenous shocks such as natural disasters and external shocks have played a role 
(as reflected in the residuals in Table 4.2).75  Eight of the 25 residuals that exceed 5 percent of 
GDP coincide with hurricanes or tropical storms. Also, global economic shocks have cont ributed 
to rising debt levels. The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 and the economic aftershocks from the 
9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 have a high incidence of large residuals. More recently, sharply 
declining growth in advanced economies stemming from the global financial crisis, particularly 
in the US, has undermined important mainstays of the OECS economies, such as tourism, 
remittances and foreign direct investment. This has undermined the stabilization of debt ratios 
achieved through moderate growth rates between 2006 and 2008.  

75   Debt write-downs contributed to debt-reducing residuals in some cases such as Antigua and Barbuda and St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines.

4. However, weak debt management has also been an underlying factor across the OECS. 
Three recently completed Debt Management Performance Assessments (DeMPAs) for 
Dominica, Grenada, and Antigua and Barbuda, evaluating the strength of debt management 
operations, reveal that the minimum requirements for effective performance were not met for a 
majority of the performance criteria assessed. Cross cutting issues include: i) weak analytical 
capacity to undertake debt sustainability analysis, risk analysis and analysis of the most cost-
effective terms for borrowing, ii) weak auditing of debt management activities, iii) weak cash 
flow forecasting and operational risk management, iv) incomplete records of debt and of debt 
guarantees, v) lack of transparency in debt operations, particularly on borrowing from the 
domestic market, and vi) weak strategy development for debt management.

1/ The methodology decomposes the change in debt to GDP ratio into factors affecting it, which are primary 
balance, grants, interest payments, real GDP growth and change in GDP deflator. The residual is the part 
unexplained by these factors and it captures the effect of exogenous factors including natural disasters, debt 
restructuring and the realization of certain contingent liabilities outside the central government. The exchange rate is 
fixed in the countries analyzed and therefore there is no exchange rate effect. 

Public Debt Sustainability 

5. This section presents a public debt sustainability exercise for the OECS, using both a 
deterministic model and stochastic simulations. The main focus is on public debt dynamics 
rather than rollover risks. It begins with a baseline scenario, drawing on the IMF’s most recent 
economic projections for the six countries. This scenario shows that some countries already face

severe situations—which will only get worst unless specific measures are taken to impede debt 
from growing. Next, the section examines the current global crisis, showing that it has had 
substantial impacts on some countries. Finally, the section undertakes several vulnerability 
exercises—considering, for example, devaluations and natural disasters. The exercise does not 
take into account other often-critical debt management issues, such as rolling over debt. This is 
certainly an issue when financial markets are tight. The risk is switching to finance with forced 
domestic borrowing, which is already beginning to happen. Overall, the exercise concludes that 
the level of public debt is already an issue for most OECS countries, one that requires careful 
strategic thinking to assure that solutions are favorable to economic and social development. 

A. Baseline Scenario 

6. Baseline projections are built on the latest macroeconomic forecast and assume an 
estimated deterioration of economic growth in 2009. The rate of real GDP contraction is 
expected to be highest in Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, and St. Lucia, all heavily dependent on 
tourism. A gradual economic recovery is projected for the medium term. Inflation is expected to 
remain low in all countries throughout the forecast period. The forecast assumes a gradual 
improvement in primary fiscal balances.  

7. Under the baseline scenario, only two countries exhibit steady declines in public debt 
ratios; some countries are on an increasing path.76 The current economic policies and initial 
debt dynamics put the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a steadily declining path in Dominica and 
Grenada. In contrast to the steep increase in Grenada’s debt-to-GDP ratio between 2008 and 
2009 (by 20 percentage points of GDP), a 24 percentage point reduction is forecasted for the 
period 2009-2014. Under the current assumption, Dominica is expected to achieve the ECCB’s 
debt-to-GDP benchmark of 60 percent by the end of 2015 (Figure 2). The debt-to-GDP ratio is 
projected to increase initially in St. Lucia, reflecting the impact of the global economic crisis, 
before starting to decline after 2010/2011.77 Debt-to-GDP ratios for Antigua and Barbuda, St. 
Kitts-Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines rise over the whole projection period, 
suggesting an increasing trend. 

76 The debt-to-GDP ratios are not in Net Present Value (NPV) terms. However, an NPV analysis is not expected to 
change the main results because the sample period is short. 
77 The public sector debt projections for St. Lucia assume that the government withdraws fiscal stimulus and 
implements a moderate degree of fiscal consolidation from 2011 onwards.  However, if the government maintains 
the current expansionary fiscal stance, the public debt-to-GDP ratio could rise to 83.3% by 2014, instead of falling 
to 79.6% under the baseline.

8. Among the six countries, St. Kitts and Nevis appears to be an outlier.  Under the baseline 
scenario, the country's public debt rises to 214 percent of GDP by the end of 2014. Annual 
primary surpluses averaging 4.4 percent of GDP in 2006-2008 did not place the debt ratio on a 
downward path. Strong economic growth, averaging 2 percent a year during this period, 
contributed to these surpluses. A similar medium-term growth performance is not likely amid the 
global crisis. The baseline scenario’s annual average primary budget surplus of 2.6 percent for 
the whole public sector is far below what is required to put the debt to GDP ratio on a declining 
path.  

B. Impact of the Crisis  

9. A no-crisis scenario helps determine the impact of current economic conditions on debt 
ratios. Recent declines in economic growth and fiscal revenues and pressures to expand 
government expenditures have severely affected the public debt ratios in the OECS countries. 
The no-crisis scenario uses IMF macroeconomic projections made before the outbreak of the 
current global crisis. Compared to the baseline, these scenarios generally assume higher growth 
rates and primary surplus-to-GDP ratios in the medium-term.78 

10. Estimates of the impact of the global crisis on most countries’ debt-to-GDP ratios are 
substantial. The adverse effects of the current global crisis have not been uniform across 
countries; therefore, the impact on debt-to-GDP ratios varies significantly. Based on public debt 
projections for year-end 2011, the debt ratios in all the OECS countries are higher in the no-crisis 

78 The source of the macroeconomic assumptions are IMF Staff Reports, published in July 2008 for Antigua and 
Barbuda, September 2008 for Dominica, October 2008 for Grenada, April 2008 for St. Kitts and Nevis, November 
2007 for St. Vincent and Grenadines, and  October 2008 for St. Lucia.

scenario than in the baseline. Antigua and Barbuda and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are the 
most heavily affected by the crisis. Under the no-crisis assumption, end-of-2014 debt-to-GDP 
ratios would be lower by more than 20 percentage points in Antigua and Barbuda and St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines. On the other hand, the crisis’ impact on the debt-to-GDP ratios of 
Dominica and St. Kitts and Nevis are rather negligible. In these two countries, debt ratios follow 
similar patterns under both the baseline and the no-crisis scenarios.  

C. Sensitivity to Shifts in Interest Rates, Growth, and Exchange Rates 

11. Standard tests are conducted on the baseline scenario to analyze the sensitivity of debt 
ratios to key economic variables. Real interest rates, GDP growth, exchange rates, and primary 
surpluses are assumed to vary from their 10-year historical means by two standard deviations. In 
addition to tests involving one risk factor at a time, a combined shock scenario assumes one 
standard-deviation movement from mean for real interest rates, real GDP growth, and primary 
surplus-to-GDP ratios.   

12. Public debt ratios are highly sensitive to changes in exchange rates . The results indicate 
that OECS countries’ debt ratios are most sensitive to changes in exchange rates. This is 
expected because the countries have been relying heavily on international borrowing. External 
debt averages 53 percent of total debt in these countries. Hence, a sharp devaluation would 
significantly increase debt-servicing costs, resulting in larger borrowing requirements and higher 
debt ratios. For example, a one-time 30 percent real devaluation would raise the St. Kitts and 
Nevis debt ratio to about 276 percent by end-2014, compared to 214 percent under the baseline. 
For Dominica, the debt ratio would rise to 85.8 percent, up from 58 percent under the baseline. 
Maintaining exchange-rate stability is of great importance for the sustainability of public debt in 
the region.   

13. A combined shock scenario has the potential to significantly increase debt burdens. 
Compared to the baseline, the combined shock of one standard deviation to primary balance-to-
GDP ratios, real GDP growth, and real interest rates in 2009 and 2010 raises debt-to-GDP ratios 
significantly in all countries except Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis. These 
exceptions occur because of the large impact of the two countries’ current crisis on real GDP 
growth rates, which fall below their respective historical means minus one-standard deviation in 
2009. As a result, projected debt-to-GDP ratios for Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts andNevis 
are lower under the combined shock scenario than the baseline.   

14. An alternative approach to fiscal sustainability uses a stochastic simulation tool to take 
interactions among key variables into account. The common practice is to estimate a VAR 
model to obtain the correlation matrix of key macroeconomic variables assumed to impact debt 
ratios.  These are: (a) domestic interest rates, (b) the real GDP growth rate, (c) exchange rates, 
and (d) foreign interest rates. The next step uses these correlations to carry out Monte Carlo 
simulations to generate a large sample of bound tests. As a result, frequency distributions for 
debt ratios can be derived for each year, providing a probabilistic assessment of debt 
sustainability. The aim of the analysis is not to determine the debt ratio’s path but to produce 
―fan charts‖ that display confidence bands for varying degrees of uncertainty around median 
projections. The analysis shows the probability that simulated debt ratios exceed or fall below 
certain levels.   

15. Stochastic simulations show that extreme scenarios have low probability and baseline 
projections are valid overall. In the case of Dominica, for instance, the probability of a debt 

163 

 
ratio above 85 percent is only 2.5 percent throughout the projection period. Furthermore, the 
upper and lower bounds for the debt ratio are both declining, mirroring the baseline path. With 
95 percent probability, estimated debt ratios are between 115 percent and 160 for Antigua and 
Barbuda and 175 percent and 260 percent for St. Kitts and Nevis. After initially moving 
upwards, debt ratios for Grenada and St. Lucia show declining paths—with 95 percent 
probability.   
D. Natural Disaster Scenario79 

16. Recurrent losses due to hurricanes are a concern to the Caribbean countries. The 
Caribbean Basin lies directly in the track of storms originating in the Atlantic Ocean. Storm 
losses to private and state property can be considerable. When Hurricane Ivan struck Grenada in 
2004, the loss was calculated at US$800 million—about two times GDP. Government losses 
accounted for about 30 percent of the damage. The impact of hurricanes is highly variable. In 
1979–2005, 13 years were ―loss free,‖ with no significant damage to any Caribbean country, 
while for eight of these years single storms caused some losses in the Caribbean. Over the 
remaining six years, significant damage was caused by multiple storms. In 2004, for example, 
Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne wreaked havoc as they crossed the region, causing combined 
losses of almost US$4.5 billion. In rare instances, storms can damage several countries, for 
example, Hurricane Ivan that affected eight nations.  

17. The impact of natural disasters is integrated into the analysis by estimating a likely 
average annual cost of the decline in real GDP growth and the increase in fiscal 
expenditures. This approach calculates the expected annual average impact of natural disasters 
for each country and then calculates the evolution of the debt burden under the revised scenario. 
The exercise is not an estimation of the impact on debt ratios of a specific natural disaster; rather, 
it distributes the impact across time as a yearly cost with an impact on growth and fiscal 
outcomes. The total annual expected cost of hurricanes is estimated as the sum of the cost of 
each type of hurricane multiplied by its probability of occurrence, taken from a 2006 World 
Bank study for the Caribbean Risk Insurance Facility (Table 4.3).80 These annual cost estimates 
are used to project the impact of hurricanes on growth and fiscal policy. The scenario assumes 
that costs of 1 percentage point of GDP reduce real GDP growth by 0.5 percentage point a year. 
One-third of the cost is directly financed by government; the rest is a welfare loss to society.81 
Consequently, annual GDP growth is reduced by half the expected annual cost, while fiscal 
expenditures increase by a third of the costs throughout the projection period.

18. Debt ratios shift upward when the expected cost of natural disasters are included. Debt 
ratios increase the most for St. Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, and Antigua and Barbuda.  The 
impact is relatively moderate in St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  It is small in 
Grenada because the country is relatively less prone to hurricanes. Overall, the inclusion of the 
expected cost of natural disasters significantly slows the decline in debt ratios in countries where 
the baseline scenario estimates a declining debt-to-GDP ratio, further reducing the sustainability 
of the debt burden. 

19. Stochastic simulations show OECS countries’ vulnerability to natural disasters puts 
non-negligible risks on public debt sustainability and could result in explosive debt -to-GDP 
paths in some cases. There is a 97.5 percent probability that the St. Kitts and Nevis debt ratio 
would be between 180 percent and 257 percent by year-end 2014 without natural disasters. This 
interval shifts upward to 190 percent to 272 percent with natural disasters. For Dominica, the 
baseline public-debt ratio rises above 66 percent, and the probability of meeting the ECCB target 
of 60 percent by the end of 2014 declines from 75 percent to 50 percent.  

20. The results are based on conservative assumptions and impacts could be larger.  The 
analysis assumes that a natural disaster costing 1 percentage point of GDP reduces real growth 
by 0.5 percentage point and government directly finances one-third of the costs. If these 
estimates were higher, natural disasters’ impact on debt ratios would be larger. In addition, 
natural disasters’ actual impact between now and 2014 would be different because the 
simulations assume costs can be spread out over time—as would take place under an insurance 
scheme.  The exercise above is akin to annual payment in exchange for spreading out the short-
term impact of the natural event over time.  

21. Under a no reform scenario debt can be explosive in some countries but this can be 
avoided through implementation of difficult, yet feasible measures .  Such measures should 
include (i) macro-fiscal measures to ensure the efficient use of tight public resources; (ii) a 
fundamental approach to reduce the existing debt burden; (iii) development of efficient insurance 
mechanisms to mitigate the adverse impact of natural disasters; and (iv) structural reforms to 
enhance growth and social stability.

Background 

Appendix 5: RPS Consultations  

1. 
The preparation of this Strategy followed a continuous and in-depth dialogue involving 
the Governments of the OECS, sub-regional organizations, representatives of civil society and 
development partners.  Engagement between the Caribbean Country Management Unit, the 
Governments and the ECCB increased significantly as the effects of the global economic and 
financial crisis began to affect the region.  The highlights are as follows: 

i. 

In January 2009 a team including the Country Economist, the Country Officer and 
specialists in social protection visited the OECS to discuss the impact of the crisis on the 
OECS economies and how the World Bank could assist.  The brief aide-memoire 
prepared at the close of the visit contributed to the intensive dialogue the Governments 
were conducting amongst themselves to determine ways of mitigating the impact of the 
crisis.   

ii. During the Country Portfolio Performance Review conducted during May through 
September 2009, the Country Officer consulted with senior officials in the Ministries of 
Finance and at the OECS Secretariat on what they perceived as the OECS’ development 
priorities in the short to medium term.    

iii. 

Finally, in September 2009 the Bank provided technical resource persons and the 
Country Director engaged in dialogue with the Ministers of Finance, during the 
―Bootcamp to Facilitate Economic and Financial Adjustment in the ECCU‖ organized by 
the ECCB, where participants looked at the concrete steps that the sub-region could take 
with a view to improving the coordination of the ECCU member countries’ policy 
responses to the global economic and financial crisis within the context of the regional 
integration arrangement.    

2. 
The formal country consultations, which began in January and continued in February 
2010, consisted of a brief presentation by the Bank team, setting out the Bank’s diagnosis of 
challenges and regional priorities, describing the proposed Partnership Strategy including areas 
of intervention and outcomes to which the interventions are expected to contribute; and the 
rationale for the selection of these areas.  This was followed by comments questions and answers 
on the proposed strategy as well as on broader issues and concerns.   

3. 
Country consultations were organized and hosted by the Ministry of Finance (in the case 
of St. Vincent by the Ministry of Planning).  In Antigua and Grenada, the meeting was chaired 
by the Minister of Finance; in Dominica and St. Kitts by the Financial Secretary; in St. Lucia by 
the Deputy Permanent Secretary and in St. Vincent by the Director of Planning. All meetings 
were attended by representatives from the public sector, the private sector and civil society.  A 
total of 225 persons attended the country consultations, broken down as follows according to 
country: Antigua 76; Dominica 19; Grenada 22; St. Kitts 32; St. Lucia 38; and St. Vincent 38.   

4. 
Finally, a late draft of the Strategy document was shared with the governments, ECCB 
and OECS Secretariat and discussions held among senior official of these institutions and senior 
Bank officials including Yvonne Tsikata, Director, Caribbean Country Management Unit (Bank) 
and Eduardo Wallentin, Acting Country Manager, Caribbean Region (IFC) via a video 
conference arranged by the ECCB on April 8, 2010.

Summary of comments received during the national consultations 

5. 
Overall the thrust of the proposed strategy was broadly endorsed by the governments, 
sub-regional organizations, development partners, the private sector and other representatives of 
the civil society.  There was agreement on the Bank's diagnosis of the sub-regional challenges 
and priorities, the benefits of the sub-regional/multi-country approach to implementing the 
proposed Strategy and the focus (principal but not exclusive) on crisis response interventions in 
the short term.  The participants stressed the need for flexibility in the design of the programs to 
permit a degree of country level customization as countries are sometimes at differing stages in 
tackling the same issue.   

6. 
There is a significant overlap in the areas of support identified in the proposed Strategy 
and the priorities identified by the participants, in particular representatives of the government 
who consistently referred to priorities as reflected in national budget speeches and strategic 
plans. However, Agriculture and Crime and Violence were raised consistently, from country to 
country as priorities for the region.  While the Bank’s support will not be focused on these areas, 
other development partners are active in these areas.   The Bank clarified that although its 
preference is to focus on areas where it has a comparative advantage and a proven track record, it 
will discuss and liaise with other donors to seek to ensure that high priority areas will not be left 
unaddressed. 

7. 
Government representatives stressed the fact that borrowing even at the Bank’s 
concessional rates would still add to their debt stock, and encouraged the Bank to provide more 
grant funding, given their high levels of indebtedness.    While acknowledging the importance of 
fiscal and debt management, government representatives commented that growth is not being 
placed as centrally as debt and fiscal issues in their engagement with IFIs; economic growth and 
mechanisms to stimulate growth must be addressed.  Participants welcomed the RPS’ focus on 
stimulating growth but stressed the need for transformative Bank Group support in this regard.  
In that connection, the IFC’s presentation stimulated much interest and discussion and there was 
also broad agreement on the importance of the four areas for IFC interventions: (i) financial 
markets; (ii) infrastructure, (iii) investment climate; and (iv) growth sectors and sustainable 
tourism.   

8. 
Non-governmental organizations stressed that this engagement should not occur only 
when a Strategy is being drafted but consistently throughout the process of implementation of the 
Strategy, in the design and implementation of projects, where they felt that they could add in 
ensuring that the most vulnerable were in fact benefitting from the Bank’s development 
assistance.     

9. 

The following is a summary of the issues that were brought to the Bank’s attention:   

 Energy: All countries as well as the donors emphasized the importance of the Bank’s support 
in this area, given the need to reduce the region’s dependency on imported fossil fuels by 
fostering energy efficiency and alternative and renewable energy solutions.  

 Ports: There was a request for regional analytical work to assess the feasibility of instituting 
a regional approach to foster the competitiveness of the ports and establish a comprehensive 
framework for consolidated trans-shipment. (Antigua) 

 Sewage and solid waste:  Attention to sewage and waste water treatment as well as proper 
handling of solid waste was emphasized to safeguard the environment.  

168 

 
 Disaster risk reduction: Support to the region with strong early warning systems in climate 
change adaptation planning across sectors was requested.  

 Agriculture: Strong desire to maintain agricultural base to ensure viable rural livelihoods.  
There was an expressed request for assistance to modernize the agriculture sector and 
enhance food security and self sufficiency. 

 Tourism: There is a need for support towards the expansion and development of the industry, 
including training persons to deliver quality services and carrying out analytical work to 
measure the economic impact of the industry to guide public investments.    

 Private sector: Most countries expressed a desire for developing a culture of 
entrepreneurship among the youth, nurturing small business by providing training in basic 
business management and helping entrepreneurs translate business ideas into concrete 
enterprises through support to small business incubation centers for example.  Concern was 
raised regarding large share of public investments captured by private sector and tax 
privileges for certain sectors only (distortions).  Frustration and confusion was expressed 
regarding Bank procurement rules which were deemed to discriminate in favor of foreign 
enterprises which benefit from tax privileges.  

 Labor markets:  Participants expressed the need: to establish information centers and data 
collection systems that would provide information on availability of jobs and on the skills 
that are needed by the labor markets; and to provide opportunities for job creation outside the 
traditionally male dominated sectors, given the large number of female headed households 
(54% in Grenada). 

 Education: Improving the quality of education and ensuring that the education and training 
systems were responsive to the labor market demand were highlighted as priorities.   

 Safety Nets: All countries underscored the need for improving their social safety net systems 
to support vulnerable groups including the disabled. 

 Health: Support to the health sector to improve life expectancy (linked to addressing non-
communicable diseases) and improving health systems (looking beyond HIV/AIDS-
Dominica) were emphasized.  

 Crime and Violence: All countries expressed their preoccupation with increased levels of 
C&V and overall citizen security and noted that this was a significant challenge in the OECS.  
The impact of crime on the tourism sector, joblessness and a feeling of ―hopelessness‖ 
among youth could develop into a social crisis of sorts.   C&V was subsequently tabled at the 
donors’ meeting and a summary account was provided of the various ongoing efforts.    

 Enhancing Access to finance for private-sector led growth:  The issue of liquidity in the 
banking system was raised.  IFC’s support was called upon to address the challenges that the 
SMEs are facing in access to liquidity. The crisis has exacerbated this challenge.  The need 
for improving information on the credit worthiness and profitability of the SMEs was also 
raised.  With these observations as a backdrop, support for the establishment of a regional 
credit bureau and a deposit insurance scheme for local banks was suggested.  

 Debt Management and Sustainability: Questions were raised on details about the Bank’s 
support and policy in debt management.  It was emphasized that the Bank needs to be a 

169 

 
development partner (not just a Bank), and be flexible.  In that connection, some countries 
raised perceived incompatibility/contradiction between taking IDA credits/IBRD loans while 
trying to reduce debt. Countries also emphasized the importance of supporting growth to 
improve the GDP and thus contribute to reducing the Debt/GDP ratio.    

 Public Sector: Support for designing and implementing coherent Public Sector Investment 
Programs (PSIP) was emphasized.   

Cross-Cutting Themes: 

 Capacity building: The need to build capacity in PPPs was raised, as domestic investors 
would like to successfully compete when opportunities arise in the region, as was the need to 
build capacity in particular areas to support regional integration, especially in view of the 
commitments in the recently signed the Economic Union Treaty. Other countries have 
developed a culture of quality service-delivery (Barbados, Belize), and there is scope for 
improvement in the OECS.  

 National statistics: All countries requested Bank support for establishing a sound and 
reliable statistics and data collection systems to enable evidence-based policy making.   

 Monitoring and evaluation: There is a need for a regional approach in strengthening the 
M&E systems and sharing information on impact assessments (request for the Bank to 
disseminate lessons learned). 

 Governance and transparency: There is a need to improve corporate governance and to 
improve transparency, particularly as regards government decisions relative to distribution of 
incentives to the private sector. 

 Donor coordination: Donors and Governments need to deepen their understanding of the 
challenges and priorities and to discuss jointly their approach to addressing those challenges. 

Meeting with Donors 

10. 
A consultation with development partners was hosted by UNDP involving representatives 
from CARTAC, CDB, DFID, EU, IDB, PAHO, UNICEF, UNIFEM, and USAID. The Bank 
presented the Strategy but also shared highlights of the feedback received during the countr y 
consultations.  

11. 
Participants received the presentation of the Strategy with interest, noting that many areas 
of focus overlap between the Bank Group’s proposed Strategy and theirs.  Participants 
underscored their desire to collaborate to share a common understanding of the countries’ 
challenges and to strengthen coordination of mutual areas of focus to improve aid effectiveness.  
However, it was also noted that there are some obvious constraints to coordination such as the 
fact that some of the programs operate at a pan-Caribbean level, while others operate at a country 
level and the fact that all donors do not lend to the same group of countries.  UNDP (chair of the 
Eastern Caribbean Donor Group (ECDG)) emphasized that the Group’s 2010 agenda will include 
a greater emphasis on aid effectiveness and increasing donor harmonization.  

12. 
Participants welcomed the inclusiveness of the Bank’s Strategy preparation process.  
They expressed concern that the Bank had no lending program and was not more active in 
Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis; the countries that seemed to need the Bank’s 
support most, given the seriousness of their financial sector vulnerabilities and its potential to 

170 

 
jeopardize the stability of the sub-regional economy.  They agreed that the sub-region’s weak 
capacity in data collection and analysis to facilitate evidence-based policy making is a concern 
for all donors and could potentially be a prime area for coordinated action going forward.
