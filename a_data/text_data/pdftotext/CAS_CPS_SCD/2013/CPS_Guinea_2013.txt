WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Guinea has made considerable progress in stabilizing over the past two years. Emerging from
political isolation, instability and military rule, Guinea adopted a new constitution, elected a President,
and fully re-integrated into the international community. A reform of the security sector was vigorously
engaged. Macro-economic stability was restored, and debt sustainability dramatically improved with the
attainment of the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion point in September 2012.
Social, institutional and economic decline which had been ongoing for years was halted. In May 2013, the
government endorsed a third poverty reduction strategy for the period 2013-15 around four main
priorities: (i) governance and public sector reform; (ii) growth and economic diversification; (iii) service
delivery; and (iv) reducing regional disparities through local development and decentralization.
Building on its vast endowment of natural resources, Guinea has now embarked on a path of long
term development. Yet, if protracted, poor governance and political instability will continue to
hinder prospects to reduce poverty and achieve shared prosperity. A legacy of political instability,
insecurity and pervasive poor governance prevents harvesting the benefits of Guinea’s natural wealth for
the vast majority living in extreme poverty. “Shared prosperity”, for Guineans, primarily means the
equitable distribution of the mineral rents. Guinea’s natural endowments, mineral resources, land, sun and
water, are immense, but were not made available for poverty reduction. In the last decade, per capita
incomes hardly grew, poverty rose sharply in recent years and the country’s mediocre economic and
social performance exemplifies the paradox of plenty.
The World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY14-17 will support Guinea to
implement a long-term development agenda of reducing extreme poverty and enhancing shared
prosperity. It addresses poverty reduction and shared prosperity by supporting improved governance
systems, fostering accelerated, equitable and diversified growth in Guinea and accompanying
improvements in human capital. Building on a World Bank Fragility Assessment and on the Interim
Strategy Note (ISN, 2011-12) which focused on human development and service delivery through
decentralization, this CPS will help the country address long-term challenges of building a credible
governance system to enable private sector investments, ensuring the transparent management of mineral
resources, strengthening the efficiency of the energy and agriculture sectors and improving the human
capital. A strong focus on governance, including transparency, public expenditure and investment
management, and efficiency of key sectors, is intended to build the foundations for shared benefits and
prosperity from mineral wealth governance. At the same time, with strong involvement from IFC and
MIGA, the CPS aims to accompany the authorities’ increased efforts to lifting binding constraints to
inclusive and private sector-led economic growth, focusing in particular on ensuring sustainability of
energy services and developing modern agriculture. The Bank will continue to be a key partner in
building systems to improve lagging human development indicators for absolute poverty reduction,
through more efficient and transparent allocation of resources, and to build shared prosperity by aligning
the business environment and education system with Guinea’s economy.
Regional synergies are critical to unlock Guinea’s growth constraints. Guinea has the opportunity to
use its strategic position, access and resources to become an important player in West Africa, and to use
its potential to benefit all Guineans. Furthermore, a coordinated regional approach will enhance the Bank
Group’s leveraging capacity with private and public partners and regional organizations to enable Guinea
develop growth corridors, exploit its hydropower potential, and become an important player in power
generation in the sub-region. This ambitious approach requires tailored government infrastructure
investment plans, a productive dialogue with private sector partners and a strong commitment to the
regional agenda.
The Bank Group will tackle governance challenges and further leverage partnerships with the
public and private sector. Effective and efficient use of financial resources has been a binding
1

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

constraint to progress in Guinea. The Bank Group’s focus on governance will contribute to expand
domestic fiscal space and higher availability of donor resources in support of development programs.
Uncertainties still surrounding Guinea’s political and economic environment warrant a flexible approach.
A limited number of projects is therefore envisaged in the first years of the CPS, and the Progress Report
on the CPS will offer the opportunity to fine-tune the CPS in its remaining years. The mix of instruments
will be based on progress recorded in the first years of implementation, as well as on the lessons from
ongoing projects. The upcoming closing of several operations provides the Bank with the opportunity to
significantly renew its portfolio of projects, and exercise strategic selectivity.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The Bank Group’s engagement builds on an Interim Strategy Note prepared in 2008 and a
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which expired in 2006 in a context of a deteriorating political
and social climate. During the previous CAS period, the economic landscape of Guinea worsened,
economic growth slowed and the incidence of poverty grew from 49 percent in 2003 to 53 percent in
2007. A military coup in 2008 led to a suspension of Bank operations for nearly three years. The
combined effects of regional insecurity, low international prices for Guinea’s main commodities, and
political and social turbulence catapulted Guinea into a state of fragility comparable to that of postconflict countries.
2.
While continued political instability was the main obstacle to growth, other issues also
contributed. The absence of infrastructure investment isolated large segments of the population,
contributing to gender inequality as traditional cultural practices became more entrenched. In addition, an
extremely difficult business climate prevented the development of a competitive private sector. The
expansion of the mining sector also possibly led elites to compete for rents, rather than develop the
economy and institutions, thus further fueling instability.
3.
The adoption of a new Constitution in April 2010 marked the beginning of a new era for
Guinea. The new constitution allowed the return to civilian rule through elections, and the reform of the
security sector. Presidential elections were successfully organized in 2010, and the suspension of aid was
lifted as the newly elected Government was recognized by the international community. In September
2012, Guinea achieved the highly indebted poor countries (HIPC) completion point.
4.
The Third National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP3) approved by the
Government in May 2013, aims to accelerate economic growth and progress toward the MDGs.
The strategic vision of the PRSP3 is to use Guinea’s large mining rents to alleviate poverty and develop a
competitive, employment-generating private sector. Stronger governance and transparency in the mining
sector, reinforced by external anchors such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and
“Publish What You Pay”, aims to ensure that the mining sector fairly and openly contributes to fiscal
revenues. A massive public investment program that prioritizes energy, transport and agriculture is
envisaged to increase productive private employment and reduce spatial inequalities, while programs for
education and health are targeted to benefit the poor. Continued monitoring and evaluation will inform
policies and projects and help strengthen the re-established democratic institutions. Mitigating the risks of
a mining economy is even more difficult in the context of Guinea’s political economy and the challenges
posed by regional insecurity, drug trafficking, gender imbalances and climate change.
5.
Following the democratic elections of 2010, the international donor community converged
to support the newly elected Government of Guinea. In addition to the Bretton Woods institutions, the
main development partners contributing substantially in financial support to the country are the African
Development Bank, the European Commission, the Islamic Development Bank, and Agence Française de
Développement. However, on specific issues other institutions and partners are crucial. The United
Nations (UN) coordinates the interventions in the area of security reform, with contributions from
bilateral aid, as well as from ECOWAS and the African Union. USAID plays a crucial role in establishing
democratic institutions, complementing the work of the EU. The EU has led the work on support for the
justice sector. Non-traditional development partners, including Arab countries, China, Brazil, Russia and
India, have focused on areas closely linked to Guinea’s comparative advantage such as mining and
agriculture, or where public private partnerships could yield rapid transfer to purely private activities.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A. Political and Institutional Context
6.
Guinea is only gradually emerging from political isolation and instability, but tensions
remain. Upon opting for independence, officially declared on the 2nd of October of 1958, Guinea almost
immediately broke all ties with the French administration, but then lived under a succession of autocratic
regimes, civilian or military. After a first long period of central planning, a new regime started a broad
range of market oriented reforms in the late 1980s. Following initial stabilization gains (until mid-90s),
macroeconomic performance weakened, structural reforms were halted – as confronting solid vested
interests, and the repression of civil and political liberties, combined with widespread corruption, resulted
in disastrous development outcomes and frequent urban social unrest. In late 2008, a military junta seized
power with a coup, which prompted the international community to stop formal relationship with (and
suspend aid to) Guinea. In 2009, the deadly repression of a mass opposition rally prompted the United
Nations to investigate responsibilities with threats of prosecution through the international criminal court.
Growing tension within the junta eventually led to its implosion and acceptance to renounce power in
favor of civilians, against the promise of security services reform, as per the Ouagadougou Accord of
January 15, 2010.
7.
A transition process (led by the National Transition Council) with support from the
Economic Commission of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union (AU) and the
international community, was organized and led to the successful election and investiture, through
a fair and transparent process, of President Condé in December 2010. Yet, the parliamentary and
local elections planned to be held shortly thereafter have since been repeatedly postponed, and in lieu of
an elected parliament, a National Transition Council (CNT) composed of 155 persons handpicked from
the Guinean society, serves as legislative body. The repeated delays and the surrounding negative political
debate, which centered largely on ethnic division, continue to pose a serious challenge to the country’s
transition to a stable democracy. The elections are currently planned for September 2013.
B. Economic Context
8.
Since 2011, the authorities promoted a macroeconomic stabilization program. Elected
authorities inherited a precarious macroeconomic situation, characterized by rampant inflation, negative
per capita economic growth, high deficits and arrears, and a highly unsustainable indebtedness situation.
The Government responded by immediately suspending reliance on central bank financing and froze most
investment contracts initiated by the military junta. An Extended Credit Facility program was signed with
the IMF and Guinea received budget support from the World Bank and the African Development Bank.
Arrears to external creditors were cleared and, in September 2012, Guinea reached the HIPC completion
point, twelve years after having reached the decision point. US$2.1 billion worth of external debt (in net
present value terms) vis-à-vis multilateral and bilateral creditors was written off, equivalent to annual
savings of US$115 million in debt service for the next 20 years. External investors, mostly attracted by
mineral resources, started to come back; economic growth rebounded and became positive in per capita
terms, and inflation decelerated.
9.
While necessary, macro-economic stability will nonetheless be largely insufficient to make a
significant dent on poverty. During the last ten years, per capita GDP grew annually by 0.4 percent on
average. Excluding the revenues of the mining sector (shared between foreign investors and the
government), per capita incomes are believed to have stagnated in the last decade, or even decreased, as
per capita private consumption decreased over the same period. Guinea’s economic growth has
increasingly become dependent on resource extraction, and the computation of adjusted net savings
suggests that Guinea’s wealth has been decreasing by the equivalent of more than 20 percent of GNI (that
4

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

is, US$1billion in 2012) every year since 2007. This indicates that investments have been greatly
insufficient to offset mineral rents dissipation in Guinea. Private investments (including residential
investments and maintenance) averaged only 15 percent of GDP between 2007 and 2012, and dropped to
a low of 5 percent in 2010 when foreign investors in the mining sector fled the country, frustrated by
frequent changes in the terms of contracts. Public investment averaged 5 percent of GDP over the same
period, and its effectiveness was highly questionable -- in particular before 2011 when performance audits
revealed ex-post that most ongoing investment programs did not comply with procurement rules and
procedures. The deterioration of the investment climate is reflected in the evolution of the Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings between 2007 and 2012, which saw a strong decline in the
sub-ratings (ranging from 1 to 6, worst from best) concerning the business regulatory environment (from
3.0 in 2007 to 2.5 in 2012) and transparency and accountability (from 2.5 in 2007 to 2.0 in 2012).

Guinea’s large natural resource rents will continue to create pressures from elites and
groups that aim to monopolize political and economic institutions in order to capture these rents.
The country is among the world’s largest bauxite producers and has rich reserves of gold, iron ore and
diamonds. Guinea is currently a candidate country under the EITI and has started implementing the
principles of the initiative but has not yet met all the requirements. Given the significance of mining as a
potential driver of growth, or fragility, enhancing the transparency and effectiveness of natural resource
management could generate valuable resources and increase trust in, and legitimacy of, state institutions.
11.
The main engine of growth in Guinea is the mineral sector, which in itself creates
substantial risks. The extractive industry does not create many direct jobs, and can lead to increased
income inequality. Secondly, strong investment and policies from the government are a condition to
diversify the economy. Thirdly, the sector increases governance risks and the potential for corruption.
There is a strong risk that Guinea’s economy, very natural-resource rich, could become subject to the
“resource curse”. Such undesirable development can be avoided by increased investment in roads and
energy that will allow for diversification through inclusive private sector development and improved
agricultural productivity; measures to increase institutional capacities to manage government resources
transparently and efficiently; and the development of human capital.
12.
Estimates based on different poverty surveys suggest that accelerated, inclusive growth
could have had a significant impact on poverty reduction. Growth could have a significant impact on
poverty reduction in Guinea: current low level of inequality and the computation of the poverty elasticity
between 1995 and 2012 suggest that one percentage point growth in per capita private consumption could
result in one percentage point reduction in the poverty rate, should growth be equitably distributed across

5

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

households. In recent years, however, slow economic growth and the mismanagement of mineral rents
prevented a significant reduction in poverty.
13.
Mineral rents should be used primarily to support this investment program, but remain
volatile. Guinea’s mining sector accounts for over a quarter of the country’s GDP and around 80 percent
of its export earnings. In the forthcoming years, investments in the mining sector are projected to double,
and mining revenues could significantly support the public investment program and the necessary
diversification of the economy which could lead to shared prosperity. However, such a strategy bears
important risks. On the one hand, possible delays in project implementation (with political instability and
difficulties to develop and protect stable and open contracts between the Government and miners), and
volatile world prices make revenue forecasts uncertain and call for continued prudent macro-economic
policies. On the other hand, efforts need to be accelerated to (i) improve the business environment for
prospective investors, and (ii) convert revenues into effective and cost-efficient public investments in
infrastructure and human development. This puts programs to improve mineral governance and public
financial and investment management at the center stage of the Government strategy. In addition, for
small investors, a number of services need to be supplied to improve the regulatory business environment.
Recent progress recorded in the 2013 Doing Business indicators are first steps for investors to secure land
rights, access finance, simplify registration, and strengthen forward and backward linkages with the
mining sector.
C. Poverty and Gender Profiles
Poverty
14.
With elusive and volatile growth, the poverty rate increased from 53 percent in 2007 to 55
percent in 2012. Declining average per capita consumption contributed to the increase in poverty, but a
mild reduction of inequality, notably in rural areas, somewhat contained the overall increase in poverty
(see Box 1). Rural – urban migrations, and the sharp increase in food prices explain why rural areas fared
better than urban areas in terms of poverty reduction, even if poverty rates remain higher in rural areas
(65 percent of population in 2012) than in urban areas (35 percent of population in 2012). Meanwhile,
extreme poverty (inability to satisfy basic food needs) increased from 12.2 percent to 18.0 percent.
15.
The incidence of poverty significantly varies across regions. For example, 67 and 65 percent
of the population living in Nzerekore (Forest Region) and in Labe (Middle-Guinea), respectively, live
below the poverty line, while in Conakry (Lower-Guinea) the poverty rate stands at 27 percent. Only,
Kankan (Upper-Guinea) saw its poverty rate reduced between 2007 and 2012, from 59 to 49 percent of
the population. While average income is higher in Conakry, and poverty levels lower, inequalities (as
measured by the Gini coefficient) are particularly wide, compared to Guinea’s other regions, see Box 1.
16.
The most important determinants of poverty are location, gender and education of the head
of household. Given the high regional disparities and rural-urban divide, geographic location is the
primary determinant of poverty in Guinea. Male-headed households are poorer than their female
counterparts. Concerning education, the level of education of the household head is a determinant of
poverty of all household members. For example, the incidence of poverty in households where the head
has not been to school at all is 2.5 times higher than that of a household headed by a university graduate.

6

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

Box 1: The data comparability and characteristics of poverty in Guinea
There have been four household surveys implemented in Guinea since 1994. The two first surveys are Living
Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) and the last two are Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire Surveys
(CWIQ). Consumption aggregates, used to compute poverty and inequality indicators, from these two types of
surveys are not, strictly speaking, comparable. This is due to significant differences in questionnaire design and
sampling method. Significant efforts have been made to make these four surveys comparable but questions linger.
For example, the Gini coefficients for the two CWIQ surveys are drastically lower than that of LSMS surveys, a
hallmark of incomparability of different questionnaires. With this caveat in mind, we present the poverty trend
below between 1994 and 2012. It should be noted that the poverty trend between the same types of surveys should
be robust (in this case, the comparison between 1994 and 2003, and between 2007 and 2012 are robust).
The increase in poverty is due to both the economic downturn and the increase in urban poverty. Between 1995
and 2012, the incidence of poverty in urban areas has doubled. The evolution of poverty in Conakry is similar to
the evolution of overall urban poverty, with a poverty rate that has almost tripled over the period. Despite the sharp
increase in urban areas, poverty in Guinea remains a rural phenomenon.

Inequality, measured by the Gini, Atkinson and Theil indexes, appears to have stagnated at the national level since
2007, following a strong decline since 1995. Overall stability of inequality in Guinea during the years 2007-2012
can be understood by the distribution of consumption. In 2007, 30 percent of people living in the poorest
households represented 13.8 percent of consumption expenditures, while 30 percent living in the richest
households represented 51.5 percent of consumer spending. These ratios were 13.9 per percent and 52 percent for
the two respective categories in 2012.
Poverty is also affected by gender, age and level of education. Controlling for other factors (education, age, family
size, etc.), the poverty rate among households headed by men was more than 6 percentage points higher than the
rate among those headed by women in 2012. However, households headed by women are worse off in absolute
terms. The difference in per capita expenditure is about 20 percent, to the disadvantage of the women. The results
of the 2012 ELEP show that poverty increases with the age of the household head. The incidence of poverty is
lower in households where the head of the household is less than 30 years of age. It increases from 30 years up to
the age group 40-49 years and remains constant until an advanced age. Poverty decreases with higher levels of
education of the household head, with a more substantial effect in reducing poverty from upper secondary level
onwards. The level of education of the spouse is also positively correlated with the well-being of the household
from the secondary level education onwards.

Guinea does not yet have an explicit
social protection policy. As discussed above, Box 2: Guinea – Gender Policy
Guinea is characterized by a high prevalence of
poverty and high vulnerability to shocks. Food The Government of Guinea recognizes that in order to
insecurity is widespread and varies significantly meet its development challenges it is critical that both

rural households reached 32 percent in 2009, economic and social development. The Government’s latest

Considerable challenges remain for
Guinean women with regard to the key areas
of the World Development Report 2012. In
education, between 2003 and 2009, the adult
literacy rate improved from 29 percent to 39
percent. While female literacy is lower than
male literacy (28 percent versus 51 percent),
there has been some progress with the ratio of
female to male literacy rates increasing from
0.42 in 2003 to 0.55 in 2009. Significant
absolute and gender-equality related gains have
been made in primary education over the past
decade. Between 1999 and 2010, the net
primary enrollment rate increased from 43
percent to 77 percent. Over the same period the

ratio of female to male enrollment rates increased from 0.64 to 0.84. While some progress has been made
with enrollment rates, overall performance and gender-equality related performance are noticeably poorer
at the secondary level. Access to tertiary education has expanded considerably over recent years and there
have been notable gains in gender equality in the sector, though from a very low base. The overall
enrollment rate for tertiary education went from just 2 percent in 2003 to 9 percent in 2008. While female
enrollment is still lower than male enrollment (4.7 percent against 14.1 percent), the expansion in tertiary
enrollment since 2003 has seen a greater relative increase in female versus male enrollment, with the ratio
of female to male enrollment rates increasing from 0.19 to 0.33. Women are also underrepresented as
teachers, making up only 5.8 percent of teachers in higher education and only 3.6 percent of doctoral level
teachers (MAS, 2011).
19.
While women’s health indicators have improved on a number of fronts (including access to
health facilities, maternal mortality, access to
Figure 3: Maternal mortality ratio (modeled
water), significant challenges remain. The
estimate, per 100,000 live births) (WDI data)

(7.1), Mali (6.3), Chad (6.0), and Burkina Faso Source: World Bank Guinea Gender Portfolio Review 2013
(5.9). Data from the 2005 DHS (ORC Macro,
2006) suggest that there were large differences between women in different wealth quintiles, with poorer
women having higher TFRs. Access to water has improved in recent years, but is still a significant issue
with regard to women’s health and time poverty, especially in rural areas. Progress on access to sanitation
facilities has been much slower. In 2008, 71 percent of the population had access to an improved water
source. This is approximately equal to the average level of access for all African countries and represents
a moderate improvement from a level of 62 percent in 2000. However, the figure for 2008 masks a large
variation between access in rural areas (61 percent) and urban areas (89 percent). In rural areas, women
often have to walk long distances to collect water, and rural populations often resort to using rain water
and water from wells which can have negative health impacts (MAS, 2011).
20.
Women in Guinea appear to be more economically engaged than in many other countries in
Africa, yet they still have fewer opportunities than their male counterparts to contribute to and
benefit from productive participation in the workforce. Gender differences in labor force participation
are not as wide in Guinea as they are in many other African countries, yet there is still a moderate gender
gap. Women’s labor force participation rate was 79 percent in 2009, compared to a rate of 89 percent for
men. This translates into a ratio of female to male labor force participation rate of 0.89, which has
remained essentially unchanged over the past decade. Those women who are economically active are
more likely to work in the informal sector and less likely to be wage employees than men. They are less
likely to occupy senior and skilled positions, earn less income, and are less likely to have sufficient access
to various inputs with which to improve their productivity. The reasons for women’s lower economic
opportunities are numerous and may include greater time poverty due to their domestic responsibilities,
lower levels of education, and cultural biases which accord a lower social standing to women.

III. DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A. Overcoming Fragility and Laying the Foundation for Long-term Stability
21.
The underlying drivers of fragility (Annex 8: Addressing Fragility across World Bank Portfolio
in Guinea) need to be addressed and present-day contributing factors resolved, in order to build a
foundation for sustainable development and to secure developmental progress. Development gains
will be at risk if the drivers of fragility are not addressed as an integral part of the country’s development
program. These include intergenerational cleavages, youth exclusion and unemployment, breakdown in
relations between civil society and the state, inter-ethnic tensions and the mismanagement of public
expectations. Further, the present breakdown in political dialogue over the electoral process threatens
stability. Sustainable development and economic growth cannot be achieved in a context where security is
not guaranteed. This has been clearly demonstrated throughout Guinea’s history, most recently during the
period 2008-2010, which saw heightened levels of insecurity, and political and social unrest. Rule of law
in Guinea is limited, as personal, property, and contractual rights are not universally protected.
22.
Governance indicators reflect Guinea’s fragility. Governance indicators have slightly
improved in recent years compared to the period of extreme institutional instability prior to 2010. In
absolute terms, however, Guinea’s scores remain low. The country’s overall score of 42.5 on the 2012 Mo
Ibrahim Index of African Governance remains significantly below both the West Africa Regional average
(51.9) and the continental average (51.2). Similarly, Guinea’s CPIA score of 3.0 for 2012 continues to
place the country in the fragile category, while currently none of Guinea’s sub-indicators on the World
Governance Indicators reaches the 25th percentile. The sub-indicators of “Rule of Law”, “Political
Stability”, and “Control of Corruption” are ranked especially low, indicating particular challenges in these
areas.
B. Laying the Foundation for Good Governance
23.
While external institutional anchors might help, strong democratic institutions supported
by the population remain the main instrument for ensuring that Guinea benefits from its natural
resources. The adoption of the new Constitution and subsequent elections in 2010 were a crucial first
step in this direction. Unfortunately the next steps, parliamentary elections followed by local elections,
have been repeatedly postponed. These delays demonstrate the difficulties in establishing strong
institutions in an environment dominated by ethnic loyalties and other historical and regional issues. The
commitment to strengthening judicial institutions and security reforms prioritized in the Government’s
development program will only be viable if the institutions are supported by the population at large and
across ethnic lines.

10

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

24.
Enhancing economic governance and public financial management (PFM) is crucial to state
effectiveness and hence economic growth. Recent PFM assessments identified a number of critical
shortcomings in budget preparation and execution processes as well as internal and external controls. In
response, the authorities have modernized the legal PFM framework with the adoption of a new organic
law related to finance in August 2012 and accounting regulations in January 2013. These new regulations
are expected to be fully implemented over a transition period of five years from 2013 to 2017. Their
specific impacts are yet to be assessed, but should be significant, given the strong focus on program
budgeting and the elaboration of Medium Term Expenditures Frameworks in key priority sectors.
25.
The modernization of the National Statistical System under the purview of the Ministry of
Planning must be prioritized to assess the impact of major policy reforms and investment projects.
Reforms need to build on ongoing efforts to improve real sector and monetary statistics. A critical mass of
economic and social information is available. However, the processing and analysis needed for design,
monitoring and evaluation is being improved. Persistent weaknesses are noted in terms of regularity and
timeliness of publications to better understand the impacts of macroeconomic policies at the micro level
(on households and enterprises). Insufficient knowledge of the informal sector constitutes a handicap for
its inclusion in the programs for poverty reduction, and in tax and employment policies. In addition, the
lack of reliable statistics in tourism, transport and public works discourages investment. The quality of
information on employment and births (the last census was held in 1996) is also major concern. In the
rural sector, the lack of an integrated system of statistics hampers the authorities’ ability to target and
monitor the implementation of policies. Further, the national statistical system is still confronted with the
absence of methodological documents on standards, classifications, and procedures for the collection,
processing, analysis and dissemination of data. All these constraints, combined with limited qualified
human resources and deficiencies in equipment and financial resources, do not allow a good design of
strategies and development programs as well as monitoring their implementation. To address such
challenges, the authorities developed a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS). This
strategy is based on four pillars: (i) Strengthening the institutional and organizational framework; (ii)
Improving the quality and the coverage of the statistical production; (iii) Capacity building to increase
efficiency in statistical services delivery; (iv) Improving the archiving system, and the dissemination and
use of statistical data, as well as improving research. There is a critical need to support Guinea in better
implementing this strategy. This will contribute to the promotion of sound and regular statistical
information that will allow the authorities to evaluate policies and adjust as needed.
26.
The urban population has been growing
from 28 percent of the total population in 1990 to

Figure 4: Improvements in access to water
and sanitation in Guinea (WDI data)

36 percent to date and continues to be confronted
with the limited availability of potable water, a key
ingredient for improving health outcomes. Over the
recent years, urban poverty has increased both in
absolute numbers and as a share of the population.
Urban growth has not been accompanied by the
infrastructure and basic services needed. The
Government will need to augment the flow of
resources to local governments, commensurate with
the mandates set for the latter in the decentralization
law. Together with appropriate capacity building at all
levels of government, this is critical to improving

urban infrastructure and basic services delivery.
Equally, improving water supply services would result in lower prices compared to what residents in

11

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

Conakry and other major cities currently are obliged to pay to third parties and would thereby increase
access to potable water.
27.
Increasing the role of social accountability networks is key to improving local governance
capacity for service delivery. Historically Guinea’s citizens have not been empowered to challenge
public institutions that delivered poor service. The institutions themselves are frequently hampered by
complex regulations. Further, the existing rules are not always applied, and it is not uncommon for
citizens to face transaction costs when accessing public services. The limitations to service delivery in
remote areas relate to lack of both financial and qualified human resources, which remain largely
concentrated at the central level. The Government envisages strengthening local accountability networks
that can challenge the public institutions and by enhancing local capacity through decentralization. As
part of its development program, the Government foresees a two-phase process to strengthen
decentralization over the next 10 years. A first phase is expected to put in place the necessary conditions
and instruments for effective decentralization and de-concentration. A second phase plans to focus on
strengthening local communities.
28.
Further, reinforcing bottom-up social accountability efforts with the ongoing modernization
agenda for the public administration will have a transformative impact. These efforts are supported
by a broad coalition of government officials and politicians but efforts suffer from a lack of coordination.
There are a number of initiatives and institutions with overlapping agendas and conflicting reporting
structures. One of the most important initiatives is the Government’s “Program for State Reform and
Modernization of the Public Administration” (PREMA) under which the High Commission for State
Reform and Administration Modernization (HCREMA) was created. The HCREMA is charged with
facilitating and coordinating public sector reform and creating a platform for participation and
collaboration with civil society. The Strategic Framework envisages first the preparation and piloting of
priority reforms, with a roadmap to clarify and confirm the role and mandate of public institutions in key
sectors, and the creation of a broad base of support among both the civil and military side of public
administration, civil society and local communities.

deployed despite an unsettled political climate. The approach to energy efficiency is two-fold: (i) a
lighting component led by Energie de Guine -EDG aims to distribute 5 million energy-saving lamps in
the country; and (ii) an efficient biomass use initiative, whereby the Government will promote efficient
wood cookers (EPC) and improved stoves. The short- to medium-term energy policy is described in Box

30.
Agricultural growth is crucial for employment and poverty alleviation in Guinea where an
estimated 80 percent of the population is sustained by agriculture. Agriculture has the potential to
boost employment growth both directly and indirectly, as there are prospects for backward and forward
linkages. Further, by reducing food prices, agriculture contributes indirectly to poverty alleviation. Guinea

The dominance of subsistence production and the
lack of market linkages have so far limited the
value-adding potential of the sector.
31.
Regional growth poles could be the starting point for building infrastructure for the
processing and exporting of agricultural products, taking advantage of the transport infrastructure
in place for resource extraction. The private sector should be considered, through IFC’s support, as a
potentially strong actor, whether as a stand-alone investor in a direct agri-business enterprise, perhaps one
that incorporates an out grower scheme, or as a participant enabling more effective functioning of the
value chain, for example, through the provision of transportation services or warehousing and cold
storage. MIGA’s guarantees could also be used for foreign investors looking to enter the market. In order
to unleash the potential in this sector, immediate actions must focus on raising productivity and reducing
factor costs, developing agricultural growth zones and infrastructure for export of fruits and cash crops,
and developing coherent sectoral strategies for agriculture. Finally for fishery which remains a key sector
of the Guinean economy, Guinea currently realizes far smaller economic benefits from its marine fish
resources than could be the case mainly due to illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. Rough
estimates indicate that Guinea could recover the shortfall on catches of around 65 percent for an estimated
US$20 million value. In 2012, the sector contributed about US$4.2 million to the annual budget from
license fees and fines whereas in neighboring Liberia fines amounted to US$5.5 million. Governance
reforms to reduce open access to resources has inevitably led to a ‘’tragedy of the commons’’ situation
where overexploitation rises as economic returns decrease, and reduction of illegal fishing could rebuild
the fisheries as a future source of growth.
32.
Guinea’s mining sector is important for growth and fiscal revenues, but creates few jobs
directly. The authorities aim to translate the country’s mineral resources into sustainable development
13

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

through developing the legal and institutional framework and increasing capacity of stakeholders to
manage and oversee the sector. Measures relate to addressing social and environmental impacts, revenue
collection, and management, distribution and investment of these revenues for the benefit of the mining
communities and the country. The sector currently represents over 80 percent of exports, provides 20 to
25 percent of government revenues (an estimated US$210 million in 2012) and over 10,000 direct jobs
(0.25 percent of the labor force). Guinea hosts some of the largest non-developed deposits of bauxite and
iron ore in the world. Bauxite is the most exploited, including the deposits of Kindia Sangaredi and Fria.
Local processing of alumina is still extremely low (about 4 percent of the production). There is significant
scope for increasing the production capacity of bauxite and the capacity utilization rate. It is in this
context that the Guinea Bauxite Company (CBG) is currently undertaking a capacity expansion that will
increase its production by 18 percent by 2018.
33.
The Simandou iron ore mining project could potentially play a transformational role. If
properly developed, such large projects are expected to have an enormous long-term impact on Guinea,
notably through spillover effects on community development (thousands of direct and indirect jobs and
related revenues, SME development, associated social benefits, health and education), the infrastructure
and power sectors, the agriculture value-chain and Guinea’s fiscal space. Such mining projects offer a
unique opportunity for Guinea to grow substantially over a relatively short period of time and it is the role
of the World Bank Group to support the Government of Guinea so that the project can be built and
operated for the greater benefit of all Guineans.
D. Strengthening Human Capital
34.
Despite progress in education, there are still many challenges related to coverage, quality,
and relevance. With a gross enrollment rate of about 80 percent in 2011 significant progress has been
made in primary school attendance, including for girls, albeit not as quickly as planned. However, school
enrollment rates by age levels continue to show an abysmal picture with approximately 60 percent of the
age 8-14 student population out of school. This represents around one million children, many of whom
live in remote and rural areas. Additionally, a learning assessment conducted in 2012 in grades 2, 3 and 4
suggests that the Government must do more to increase primary completion rates, achieve gender parity,
improve learning outcomes, and make education more relevant to the needs of the labor market. A
relatively low share of GDP is geared towards education (less than 3 percent) and a distribution of
resources between the different education sub-sectors that is not aligned with MDG goals is not
conducive to improvements in the sector.

Progress towards achieving the health MDGs by 2015 hinges on improving the management
and financing of the health care system. Health sector challenges are multiple with deteriorating trends
in many health sector indicators. Access to prenatal care and to some child immunizations (DTP3) has
significantly increased from 2000 to 2011. However, infant and maternal mortality rates (at respectively
67 per 1,000 and 980 per 100,000) are among the highest in Africa. This is the result of deteriorating
access to many health services, particularly in the rural areas, low quality of health services, weakening in
some child vaccinations since 2008 and inadequate and irregular budget allocation to the health sector. In
relation to spending, the combination of very low allocation (less than 1 percent of GDP) and weak
execution undermines the effectiveness of health sector policies. The Government will need to mitigate
14

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

the financial burden through the establishment of health insurance schemes and health mutual, raising
significantly the share of the population covered by these beyond 4 percent. Health expenditures which
are currently focused on secondary care, tertiary care, and central administration, need to be redirected
towards primary care.

The Government will need to take measures to extend social protection coverage and
improve its quality in the short- to medium-term. It also needs to develop a coherent social protection
strategy and an effective safety net system capable of reducing inequality and increasing resilience to
shocks, such as a rise in basic commodities prices. These concerns can be addressed by improving the
management and operation of subsidies by providing clear price information on such products,
strengthening price and quality control institutions, and fostering better coordination between the central
and local levels of such institutions. It is also fundamental that an educational conditional cash transfer
approach be implemented in rural areas, as well as a non-contributory health insurance for the poor and
the extreme poor.
IV.

GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGY
A. Unlocking Diversified and Inclusive Growth: Guinea’s Development Agenda
PRSP-III

37.
Recognizing the challenges and issues at stake, the Government of Guinea, in its Third
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, plans to foster inclusive and sustainable growth. Indeed, the poor
economic performance over the last decade was inadequate for laying the basis for accelerated growth
that would trigger job creation and reduce poverty sustainably. The new Government strategy focuses on
the diversification of economic growth sources, the implementation of sector strategies and support for
the social sectors.
B. Targeting Growth by Sector
38.
To mitigate the risk of a mineral economy, the PRSP focuses on economic growth in sectors
that may drive overall economic growth. Economic policies are targeted to boost development in
agriculture, mining, hydroelectricity, as well as construction and public works, information and
communications technology (ICT), and tourism. These sectors are prioritized on the basis of Guinea’s
comparative advantage, notably its resource endowment. The choice is strategic; not all sectors are
chosen, for example the PRSP does not cover the manufacturing and urban sector in the same detail as it
does the agricultural or electricity sectors.

15

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

39.
Spatial inequalities will be addressed by a “growth corridor” approach to private sector
development. Public infrastructure—transport, electricity and telecommunications—will be the backbone
of the growth corridors. Such infrastructure can be linked directly to major mining sites, or financed
indirectly by mining revenues but linked to hydroelectricity sites and trade opportunities with neighboring
countries or targeted at regions with the highest levels of poverty. The infrastructure will be
complemented by broader growth areas, defined as all land within two hours’ travel distance to the
corridor, where clarification of land rights will be prioritized to provide investors with secure land
property rights. Secure property rights and adequate infrastructure will be a condition to attract
investments, including with support from IFC and MIGA. Potential large-scale project sponsors will be
encouraged to contract local small-scale enterprises along their supply or distribution value chains.
C. Embracing Regional Integration
40.
Effective regional integration offers Guinea a great chance to diversify its economic base.
The country’s hydro potential could be transformed into a sustainable source of export income, leveraging
ongoing initiatives such as the West African Power Pool (WAPP). Equally, Guinea could realize its
comparative advantage in promoting certain agricultural products, where the country’s geographical
proximity to Senegal and Mali offers a real opportunity for export-led growth. Finally, broader regional,
cross-border trade could benefit from ongoing reforms supported by the IFC Investment Climate Program
working to improve Doing Business indicators.
41.
The construction of rail, port and airport infrastructure will contribute to sustainable and
diversified growth in Guinea. Current infrastructure projects mainly focus on rail and port developments
and are linked to the large mining developments: (i) corridor Nord-Ouest (North-West corridor) will
imply the extension of the infrastructure to access the bauxite deposits up to the northern area of Gaoual;
(ii) Corridor Sud-Est (South-East corridor or Trans-Guinéen), to be developed as part of the Simandou
project, will have to accommodate the transport of 150+ megatons per annum (mtpa) of iron ore
production from the Simandou deposits, and possibly some of the bauxite and iron production of the
Central area. Outside the mining sector, four other projects are currently in the Government’s plans: two
of them are related to ports (Conakry and Benti), one is a new international airport, and one is the rail link
to Mali. Conakry is a small port, which has reached the limits of its handling capacity. Two port
extensions have been planned, and one is to be completed in 2013 (extension of the container terminal),
while the other, which includes an extension of the oil terminal, is still at a project stage.
D. Promoting SMEs and an Enabling Business Environment
42.
Guinea plans to broaden the country’s small and medium enterprise (SME) base through
investment climate reform, solutions to improve access to finance, and the establishment of SME
growth corridors. Severely limited access to finance (especially for SMEs), inadequate supply of
infrastructure, deficiencies in logistics and trade facilitation, corruption and low capacity of the
Government, inflation, and poor education of the workforce, combined with one of the weakest legal
enabling environment for business in Africa and a history of poor governance, erratic policy, and
inconsistent regulatory enforcement, has seriously undermined investor confidence in Guinea’s
institutions. As a result, private participation in the economy remains low and firms’ productivity
measured by value added is one of the lowest in Africa. Firms’ links with the financial sector are weak;
only 6 percent of firms surveyed in the 2006 Enterprise survey have a bank loan. Credit to the private
sector is low as well, at around 5 percent of GDP for much of the last decade (against a Sub-Saharan
African average of 59.6 percent). By end 2012, the formal banking sector consisted of the Central Bank
and 14 commercial banks (with 3 more having received an agreement and getting ready to start). The
banking sector is highly concentrated, not up to date technologically and banks tend to favor short-term
lending at high interest rates. While the microfinance sector grew strongly from a small base,
16

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

microfinance institutions are loss making and need capacity and technology upgrading. Finally, it is
important for the efficiency and the use of payment services by all potential users to be improved, in a
context of financial inclusion.
43.
Cross-border financial activities with neighboring countries will further strengthen regional
ties between Guinea and its neighbors. Financial service activities in Guinea are based largely on trade,
especially with neighboring countries; this offers an opportunity to undertake a feasibility exercise of
integrating retail financial services between Guinea and other WAEMU countries to facilitate crossborder payments and support small-scale trade. Ensuring interoperability of financial infrastructure
through integration of the country with the WAEMU financial platform, will contribute to harmonizing
the country’s financial sector regulatory framework with the one governing WAEMU member states.
E. Developing Twenty-first Century Skills
44.
Education needs to equip Guineans with the right skills for the emerging export-oriented
activities such as agriculture, mining, and tourism. The lack of relevant vocational programs in
secondary and tertiary education has led to an excessive emphasis on general education with a focus on
humanities. Promoting SMEs and an enabling business environment will help deliver the diversification
agenda, and mitigate the sensitive issue of youth unemployment. Guinea needs to focus on scientific and
technological skills and core competencies required by the vast majority of economic sectors and
technical skills relevant to the key priority sectors.
45.
Investors providing on-the-job training should find local competencies more widely
available in Guinea. The government plans to open training and vocational education centers, while also
creating higher education offer by introducing mining universities. Defining and implementing support
programs for skills development and higher education will be critical to generate local jobs from large
mining investments.
V. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA (FY14-FY17)
A. The World Bank’s Role in the Current Landscape of Development Assistance in Guinea
46.
A key and longstanding partner of Guinea, the World Bank will leverage its strategic
position. The Bank will convene the other development partners to support Guinea’s development
agenda, especially around the key sectors of energy, agriculture and human capital development. In
addition to its financial contribution to supporting the Government’s PRSP, the Bank Group will
contribute its large knowledge base and provide advisory leadership to help Guinea formulate and
implement sound and results-based development solutions.
47.
The World Bank Group CPS for the period FY2014-FY2017 focuses on: (i) improving
governance and service delivery, (ii) stimulating growth and economic diversification, and (iii)
strengthening human capital. The delivery approach of proposed interventions under the CPS the Bank
will be by (i) leading in a small number of selected areas where the World Bank has a well-established
track record; (ii) complementing the activities of other development partners on issues for which the Bank
Group shares a common vision and development objectives with such partners; and (iii) keeping the Bank
Group informed on developments on issues where the Bank Group does not intervene directly. From a
sectoral perspective, proposed operations are mainly focused on agriculture and energy, using the full
spectrum of instruments at the World Bank’s disposal: economic sector work (ESW), technical assistance
(TA), investment financing and policy lending, given the potentially high synergies between them. IFC
and MIGA will contribute, each based on their respective areas of expertise.

17

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

48.
The focus areas of the World Bank Group CPS were selected based on an assessment of the
World Bank Group’s comparative advantage. Consistent with the Africa Regional Strategy, this CPS
focuses on areas where the Bank can contribute directly to (a) inclusive growth through better governance
and diversification and (b) strengthening of human capital, with a strong focus on regional synergies. The
CPS draws on a Fragility Assessment conducted by the Bank’s Global Center on Conflict Security and
Development and feedback received via the Client Survey, and integrates considerations related to
addressing fragility and building lasting stability across the portfolio. Finally, this CPS has benefited from
an extensive stakeholder consultation process, which involved civil society, NGOs, Government, the
business community, parliament, and the donor community, both in Conakry, as well as throughout the
country.
49.
In the Client Survey, stakeholders identified energy sector development as the key
development priority in the country. Education, public sector governance, and
security/stabilization/reconstruction emerge as priority areas as well. Under the umbrella of poverty
reduction, respondents recognized rural and agricultural development (along with the energy sector) as
critical to reducing poverty in Guinea. Within this context, respondents are keen to see the Bank focus its
financial resources and knowledge work in these particular areas. Clients also perceive the World Bank as
a trustful guardian of sound and transparent governance practices and pro-poor reforms in Guinea.
B. Ongoing World Bank Group Portfolio
50.
The proposed CPS builds on strengths and lessons learned from the current portfolio. The
national IDA portfolio consists of 6 approved operations for a total of US$116.15 million, including a
Village Community Support that has disbursed its IDA component entirely and continues to disburse
donor funds, and a recently approved Micro and Small Enterprise operation. About US$66 million
remains to be disbursed. Since the Bank’s re-engagement with Guinea in April 2011, several projects
have been restructured to allow for rapid service delivery without overburdening the limited institutional
capacity. Disbursements have picked up and most projects are being upgraded to satisfactory status.
Guinea has ended Fiscal Year 2013 with a 28.5 percent (as of the end of June) disbursement ratio, above
both the IDA 25 percent target and the 16 percent AFR trend disbursement rates (annualized at 19.2
percent). In addition, the E-signature disbursement procedures are being applied to the entire active
portfolio, projected to boost the disbursement rate further. Guinea also benefits from four regional
operations amounting to US$68.1 million: the Niger Basin Water Resources Development and
Sustainable Ecosystems Management Project (US$9 million), West Africa Regional Communications
Infrastructure Project APL-1B (US$34 million), Senegal River Basin Multi-purpose Water Resources
Development Project (US$18 million), and the West and Central Africa Air Transport Safety & Security
Project (US$7 million).
51.
The fiduciary performance of the current portfolio is, to some extent, hampered by capacity
constraints, especially in the procurement processes. As a result, some initiatives have been taken to
overcome systemic procurement issues; for example, a focal point has been designated at the Ministry of
Finance to follow up on administrative clearances. Financial Management performance has generally
been good, as almost half of the Project implementation supervision reports (ISRs) are rated as
satisfactory with a moderate financial management (FM) risk rating. Most interim financial reports (IFR)
are being submitted on time to the Bank and the quality of reports appears acceptable. In 2012, Guinea
achieved 80 percent fiduciary compliance of audited reports submitted within the fiscal year. Most of the
opinions of the audit reports were unqualified and there were no significant FM issues

18

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

C. Lessons from the Previous Country Strategies
52.
The previous CAS and the 2011-12 ISN provide the following lessons for the 2014-2017
CPS, as detailed in the CAS Completion Report:
a.

Sector policy dialogue needs to be integrated into the macro policy dialogue and elevated to the
highest level, reflecting the increasingly centralized nature of the policy dialogue. This approach
may also require the Bank to focus on supporting key reforms, wait for policy decisions to
materialize at the preparation stage, before committing funding for investments even if investment
levels are relatively modest. Positive examples of these lessons were acquired by the education and
governance projects, as well as the analytical work on trade issues.

b.

Development Policy Operations can provide an effective framework for Government entities to
focus on the implementation of a selected and time-bound set of critical reforms, as it was observed
in the 18 months prior to the attainment of the HIPC completion point. Enabling conditions for
success include complementary technical assistance, harmonized budget support from partners, as
well as an adequate macro-economic framework.

c.

In choosing lending instruments, consideration should be given to the specific sector objectives and
the overall institutional environment of the sector. While certain instruments (such as APLs) were
seen as innovative in addressing previously identified weaknesses in traditional project lending,
financing was not always adequate to complete all activities planned in each phase. Without
presumed recourse to the subsequent phase, triggers become less meaningful and there’s a risk of
incomplete activities.

d.

The design of the operations should be simple and focused on the Government’s priorities and
commitment. Consistent with the Government’s strategy discussed above, local authorities and
communities should play a crucial role in the design and implementation of such projects and be
represented in the oversight committee.

e.

Implementation arrangements and staffing need to be well-embedded in existing administrative and
political structures. Pro-active project supervision (and effective management) should aim to identify
opportunities and take action where they occur. The background is that while almost all Bankfunded projects are led by project implementation units (PIUs), experience shows management
responsibility should be entrusted to suitable Government units, equipped for the task.

f.

M&E systems should set realistic targets and be established prior to project launch, including
arrangements for collecting and analyzing data. As always, the timetable for project activities should
be consistent with borrower implementation capacity.

g.

Given the anticipated and unanticipated risks associated with working with fragile countries in
general, close coordination with other development partners is indispensable for mitigating risks,
realizing synergies, and increasing leverage in such important areas like policy dialogue.
D. Proposed Program

53.
The CPS addresses poverty reduction and shared prosperity by supporting improved
governance systems, fostering accelerated, equitable and diversified growth in Guinea and
accompanying improvements in human capital. The proposed program of activities is grouped under
the following Strategic Areas of Engagements: (i) Improve governance, (ii) Stimulate growth and
economic diversification, and (iii) Strengthen human capital. The IDA resources allocated for Guinea for
the CPS, are indicative and subject to: (i) total IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s performance
rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits) and the allocation
19

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

deductions associated with debt relief; (iv) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA
assistance terms for other IDA borrowers; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. The FY15
allocation will depend on the above factors, as well as on the overall size of the IDA 17 replenishment. 2
54.
The WBG’s twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity will be
pursued through existing and new investment and technical assistance instruments. For example the
Bank’s Productive Social Safety Nets project which aims to provide income support to vulnerable groups
and lay the foundations of a social safety net strategy by testing some of the building blocks necessary for
a larger system, will contribute to the poverty goal. The project plans to support a labor intensive public
work program in urban areas with a focus on youth and life skills trainings. For example in Conakry, the
capital, the number of beneficiaries for this component is expected to reach 162,000 urban poor people,
including 33,000 temporary jobs, with the person/days of work reaching 2,700,000.
55.
The Bank will pursue governance and public sector reform in order to alleviate
administrative constraints and improve social service delivery to the poor. To spearhead economic
growth, employment creation, and poverty reduction, the Bank Group’s support will focus on boosting
private sector development, with a specific focus on agriculture and energy. Finding a sustainable solution
to Guinea’s current energy crisis will be central to boosting shared prosperity for all. With the ongoing
Electricity Sector Efficiency Improvement Project and its follow-on operation, the Bank will work with
the Government to replace across-the-board subsidies with a sustainable price structure envisaging lower
rates for small consumers. This will target subsidies at low income households and reduce subsidies from
the budget to the power generating and distribution company (Electricité de Guinée). Liberalization of the
electricity price for large consumers will also help to develop Guinea as a hub for regional power
generation and distribution. Furthermore, a legal framework for public private partnerships would attract
private investors. In parallel, a poverty-oriented power strategy could focus on sustainable biomass
harvesting and more efficient stoves.
56.
In the course of CPS implementation, the Bank will build the foundations for shared growth
generated by mining and diversified activities in agriculture. The Bank will fine tune ongoing
activities, improve the knowledge base and launch new programs to introduce transparency in linking
revenues with priority public investments and pro-poor expenditures. This will entail public expenditure
management, public investment planning, budget transparency with citizen monitoring mechanisms, as
well as improving the governance structure and capacity of key sectors, mainly mining, energy,
agriculture, but also health and education. At the same time, the Bank will contribute to setting up
systems for skills development to meet the demands of Guinea’s economy, as well as in basic and higher
education and in health.

2

Also, IDA allocations are made in SDRs based on performance. While the US dollar equivalent amount is
provided at the exchange rate of USD1.50233/SDR, the final exchange rate for each operation depends on the
applicable prevailing rate at the time of approval.

Strategic Areas of Engagement 1: Improve Governance
57.
The Bank expects to contribute to improving transparency and efficiency in public resource
management, as well as specifically contributing technical expertise and resources to improve the
governance framework of the mineral sector.
Outcomes
1. Improved mining governance
structure and transparency
2. Improved transparency of the
public sector including HR system
management
3. Budget reform introduced
including citizen monitoring

Indicators

58.
As indicated in the poverty analysis above (see Section II. C on Poverty and Gender
Profiles), elusive and volatile growth have led to an increase in poverty rates in recent years. The
World Bank Group will continue to support the Government in maintaining macroeconomic
stability and economic governance for equitable growth. Efforts will continue to focus on reforms in
public expenditure and public investment management, including the improvement of fiscal policy and
the pursuit of prudent fiscal and monetary policies that helped to break the spiral of inflation and the
depreciation of the exchange rate. This will also entail supporting effective monitoring of the state owned
enterprise portfolio and public investment management. The Bank will support the Government’s
program for further structural reforms to reduce barriers to the realization of the country’s full economic
potential. Regarding administrative governance, the Bank’s support will focus on supporting the
Government’s ongoing reform and modernization program (PREMA).
59.
Bank support to Public Sector Management and Governance will be comprehensive and
include a variety of ongoing and new instruments. A technical assistance project, the Economic
Governance and Technical Assistance and Capacity Building (EGTACB) project, became effective only
recently, yet it reflects the priorities of a more uncertain political transition. The project will continue to
provide support for strengthening basic capacities in budget management and public administration, while
initiating support for public investment management, but its design will be fine-tuned to the new context
of longer term governance priorities. A GPF Trust Fund complements this program in support to the
establishment of an investment fund for revenues from natural resources. New activities will include: (i)
an SPF Trust Fund further supporting public administration leadership and reform; and (ii) on the basis of
the performance of EGTACB, a new IDA Credit, in the form of a Results-Based Technical Assistance
project, ensuring sustainable support to public investment management, as well as to the implementation
of reforms to improve the investment climate, in agriculture and energy sectors. The CPS program also
envisages a follow-on operation that will likely address specific executive governance constraints in
public financial management.
60.
The Bank Group will continue to support reforms, initiatives, and short- to medium-term
capacity building to enhance the efficiency and governance systems for institutions involved in the
management of the mining sector. Reforms will be supported all along the Extractive Industries Value
Chain, with the exception of revenue management. The World Bank Group will also support the
development of a framework that promotes regional and local development of mining areas and “demand
for good governance”. In light of the recently adopted policy to increase state ownership of mines and
associated infrastructure (rail and road), this recently approved Mining Sector Governance and TA project
will provide the following: (a) Support to the Société Guinéenne du Patrimoine Minier (SOGUIPAMI) to
clarify its mandate and role vis-à-vis the Ministries of Mining, Transport and Finance; and (b) Transaction
23

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

advisory to relevant government entities regarding available options for financing, ownership, access fees
and operating costs of mines and infrastructure to enable informed decision-making; and to provide
relevant technical, legal and financial advisory services related to potential financing and management of
mining assets. The project will also strengthen the government’s capacities to license, control and monitor
technical, environmental, and financial compliance of mining operations.
61.
The Bank will continue to support improvements to the governance of the mining sector
through the Mining Sector Technical Assistant Project, which became effective in FY13, to support
the capacity of the Ministry of Mines and Geology in contract negotiation, implementation of the new
mining code and coordination with relevant ministries. The Bank will also support progress towards the
EITI. Further support to the governance of the sector will be provided through a new operation which will
address key policy actions in mining, energy and agriculture.
62.
To improve capacity to collect, analyze and use poverty data and statistical information in
key sectors, the Bank will prepare a Country Statistical Brief and seek resources from the
Statistical Capacity Building Trust Fund to support the National Statistical System. The Country
Statistical Brief will include: (i) an evaluation of existing statistics for all sectors; (ii) an assessment of the
main constraints to statistical development; (iii) a review of the implementation of NSDS (National
Strategy for the Development of Statistics), including existing and planned programs; (iv) a review of
partners’ activities including the Bank; and (v) an identification of activities that the Bank could support
(financing, knowledge, partnership). It is envisaged that the Bank’s support will focus on the collection of
household statistics that will allow the authorities to assess the welfare impact of specific policies and
investment projects (see Annex 12).
63.
The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes-Accounting and Auditing of Guinea
(ROSC) highlighted serious weaknesses of the Professional Accounting Organization (PAO) in
Guinea. The Government has therefore recognized the need for support in strengthening the capacity of
the PAO to be more active in the process of regulation and making financial information transparent. An
Institutional Development Funds (IDF) will support the development of the accounting profession in line
with the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) requirements. The improvement in the use of
IFAC standards would contribute to bolstering overall quality of the accounting and audit profession in
Guinea and enhance the country’s financial accountability arrangements and governance practices with a
real impact on private sector development.
Strategic Areas of Engagement 2: Stimulate Growth and Economic Diversification
64.
Under this area of engagement, the Bank Group’s program will focus on addressing key
constraints to growth, diversification and employment creation, in particular by playing a catalytic role in
energy, agriculture, private and financial sector development, and regional integration.

Hydroelectricity
65.
The hydroelectricity sector could provide the basis for Guinea’s modernization and also
supply regional markets. Guinea’s large hydropower potential is estimated at over 6000 MW,
which could make it an important exporter of power to neighboring countries. The overall
electrification rate is estimated at 17 percent, with rural electrification at 3 percent only. In 2011, the
urban power generation capacity in Guinea was 130 MW, against an estimated peak demand of 230 MW,
thus resulting in widespread load shedding. Hydropower contributed 55 percent of generation, versus 45
percent for oil-based thermal power. The urban electricity sector, managed by the state-owned utility
Energie de Guinée (EDG), is in a critical situation resulting in widespread power shortages; dilapidated
infrastructure due to lack of investment and maintenance; high system losses and electricity theft; low bill
collection; and increasing financial losses. Given the current level of subsidies to the sector and the
persistent inefficiency of the utility, there is a need to improve the company’s financial and technical
performance before extending the grid or expanding hydropower. In its action plan for EDG, the
Government has included signing a performance contract between EDG and the Government and an
external assistance contract with a private operator for the management of EDG. To address the ruralurban divide (see Section II. C above) the Bank will support the Government address the off-grid needs,
and the Government has committed to the creation of a Rural Electrification Agency. In the longer term,
Guinea needs to shift gradually away from thermal power generation to hydropower as its main source of
generation for all customers (including mines) and become an exporter of power to other West African
nations. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) constitute the best opportunity for Guinea to develop its
hydropower potential.
66.
Despite the current state of the sector, the development prospects of Guinea’s energy sector
are extremely positive. There is an enormous untapped potential for hydroelectricity: out of 6000 MW
only 127.2 MW are installed capacity. Flagship projects of hydroelectric development include the Kaléta
project for an installed capacity of 240 MW (in progress) and Souapiti, a 515 MW hydropower project.
There are also several rehabilitation projects of the electrical network underway, initiated with the support
of donors (World Bank, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank), as well as
interconnection projects with neighboring countries (Côte d'Ivoire-Liberia - Sierra Leone - Mali and
Senegal), which received the support of the WAPP. The Government has a 20-year plan to realize the full
potential of the sector, covering the supply and demand of energy and incorporating the concerns of
energy efficiency and renewable energy development. In the medium term, a three-year action and
investment plan to improve EDG’s performance includes: (i) an investment plan of over US$1 billion
over the next three years, of which almost US$300 million are yet unfunded. This plan includes the
25

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

Kaléta hydropower plant (US$527 million) to be funded and built through support from China. Other
investments cover power generation, and transmission and distribution, including meters for low-voltage
customers; (ii) a sector recovery plan, which includes modifying the legal framework for the sector and
for PPPs, the restructuring of EDG, and signing a performance contract between EDG and the
Government and an external assistance contract with a private operator for the management of EDG.
Complementary progress on the reform front to ensure adequate regulatory capacity will be supported
through the multi-sectoral (governance, agriculture, energy) Results-based Technical Assistance Project.
67.
The Bank will continue to be engaged in Guinea’s energy sector primarily through the
Electricity Sector Efficiency Improvement Project, with an overall financing of US$30 million. The
project is focused on improving the technical and commercial efficiency of the distribution network in the
city center of Conakry; it also includes actions to rehabilitate power generation and improve EDG’s
management. The Bank Group will provide timely advice to the Government for appropriate approaches
for institutional, technical, and economic design and implementation of access expansion programs, in
consultation with other donors. In addition, the World Bank’s engagement with the energy sector in
Guinea is well aligned with the Government’s priorities, in particular, the development of its large
untapped hydropower potential through public-private partnerships with the mining sector and through
regional projects that will enable Guinea to export part of its hydropower to neighboring countries. In
addition, the Bank brings a number of comparative advantages (e.g. global knowledge, convening power,
expertise for policy advice related to access, etc.) that position it strongly to lead this Technical
Assistance. MIGA’s product could also be used on its own, or alongside other Bank products, to support a
PPP process or more generally to encourage private investors into the sector.
Agriculture
68.
To reduce the high levels of poverty in rural areas, the Bank will support efforts to increase
agricultural productivity. To this end, the Bank’s future efforts will initially focus on food crop
productivity in FY13 and FY14, with built-in support for market access, commercialization and non-food
export crops in FY15, as part of a sector-wide program supporting Guinea’s inclusive National
Agricultural Investment Program. The Emergency Agricultural Productivity (PUAPA) Project and the
Second Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Project (EAPSP) will empower farmer
organizations in the distribution of government goods and services as a transition to a more market-based
mechanism through the Government’s agricultural sector investment plan (PNIASA). The two ongoing
agriculture sector operations: the EAPSP and the WAAPP, complement each other by focusing on
providing producers with inputs to increase food crop production (inputs for rice, maize, cassava and
vaccination of traditional poultry). The Bank will work with the Government of Guinea to draw from the
lessons from these two ongoing projects to inform the design of the proposed follow-on operation. A new
agricultural operation (IDA, $10 million) will support the diversification of activities beyond traditional
rice farming, and contribute to the rebuilding of Guinea's agricultural research and technology transfer
capabilities. The project is expected to help identify commodities with the highest potential for export and
contribute to increase productivity for these commodities selected by the PNIASA, which have the
potential to increase food security, reduce poverty and increase rural income. Complementary progress on
the reform front to develop an enabling investment climate will be supported through the multi-sectoral
(governance, agriculture, energy) Results-Based Technical Assistance Project.
69.
With regard to Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA), an agricultural public
expenditure review (FY13) and a Sources of Growth (FY14) Study will help lay the foundation for
new investment lending in FY14 and FY17 as part of a sector-wide program supporting the National
Agricultural Investment Plan. While the Agriculture Public Expenditure Review (PER) is under
implementation, the analytical work on sources of growth still needs to be funded. Furthermore, IFC and
MIGA will pursue agribusiness investment opportunities in Guinea where potential exists.

The Bank’s strategy for the agriculture sector (including the fisheries sector) will support
the fourth pillar of the PRSP3: Strengthen fight against hunger and malnutrition, with a view to
halting high rates of rural poverty and worsening poverty trends linked to increase in food prices in
in urban areas (see Section II. C above). Enhanced food production would reduce vulnerability to
global price spikes, and potential to address to poor production of a wide range of crops for export can
generate both incomes from peasant farming and employment opportunities in commercial agriculture.
Guinea’s diverse climatic zones allow production of a range of products from rice to fruits (for example,
mango, pineapple, and banana) and cash crops (for example, coffee, cocoa, palm oil).
Mining
71.
Guinea is poised to receive massive amounts of foreign direct investments in mining and
related infrastructure projects. The pipeline of proposed large FDI inflows in mining and related
infrastructure is estimated at above US$20 billion, which is about 4-5 times the country’s GDP in 2010.
On the other hand, the Guinean economy is still relatively weak, with a poor investment climate likely to
face a massive exogenous shock with the discovery and exploitation of natural resources. The Bank
Group will help lay the foundation for a sustained growth path based on these natural resources and for
economic diversification by helping this economy to face the upcoming changes.

The Simandou mining project. The iron ore deposits have historically been the subject of
intense competition among global mining conglomerates, including Rio Tinto (Simandou blocks 3 and 4
in which the IFC holds a 5 percent interest). The Simandou deposit is under development, with an
investment representing almost three times the GDP of Guinea in 2011, and it is projected that it will
contribute on average about US$1.2 billion in royalties and taxes during the operation phase (more than
doubling Government revenues). The development of the project is however facing a number of
challenges, and the World Bank Group has a key role to play in overcoming these. There are other major
iron projects in different phases of development. Guinea is also endowed with other mineral resources
(nickel, limestone, copper, gold, diamond, among others). Hence, the establishment of the appropriate
27

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

investment conditions could enable the development of the proposed large projects with resulting
significant economic and poverty alleviation impacts for Guinea and its neighboring countries. MIGA’s
product could also be used to support investors into the sector.
73.
In order to expand the benefits of large investments in the mining sector in Guinea, IFC has
developed a strong Advisory Services (AS) program. Guinea was selected as the 8th country under the
IFC Conflict Affected States in Africa (CASA) Program in 2012 and since then CASA has contributed to
further informing IFC’s interventions and strategy in Guinea, to focus on: (i) improving the business
environment through regulatory reforms; (ii) strengthening SMEs and supporting institutions; (iii)
rebuilding financial markets, banks and other financial institutions; and (iv) increasing private sector
involvement in providing and rebuilding infrastructure.
74.
IFC will continue its efforts to promote the development of the Guinean private sector
through investment climate (IC) and SMEs development programs. The investment climate program
which was recently restructured to better focus on top priorities of the private sector reform agenda will
continue to aim to improve the competitiveness of, and maximize the economic opportunities for, SMEs
in the mining sector. Concerning SME development, the 3-year Local Supplier Development Program
(LSDP), which was launched in 2012, aims to enhance the development and transformational impact of
the Simandou project through increasing local content, creating sustainable local supply chains, and
developing local skills using the Business Edge™ (BE) product, an IFC training program in management
and financial skills.
75.
IFC will continue to develop a strong AS pipeline to ease access to finance for SMEs in
Guinea. IFC plans to establish a risk sharing facility with a local bank that will ease/expand access to
finance for local SMEs. In parallel, following enactment of a new leasing law in early 2012, IFC is
working with the Central Bank of Guinea (BCRG) to develop a leasing finance framework aimed at
promoting leasing as an alternative financing solution for medium- to long-term financing needs. Other
activities planned in the rest of the pipeline include a regional venture program and the establishment of a
PPP program to support potential investments opportunities in energy, agribusiness and tourism.
76.
There has been encouraging progress in business regulation reforms as measured by the
2013 Doing Business Report, which ranked Guinea as 178th out of 185 countries. Through the
MSME Development Support Project recently approved, the Bank will help create new technical centers
in different regions in support of local MSMEs.
77.
Guinea plans to broaden the country’s small and medium enterprise (SME) base through
investment climate reform, solutions to improve access to finance, and the establishment of SME
growth corridors. In 2012, IFC supported the creation of an Investment Promotion Agency (APIP) and a
one-stop shop to facilitate enterprise creation. Two other reform measures were implemented and
preparation of five other reform measures is currently underway. A Public-Private Dialogue (PPD)
framework is envisioned, among others, but there is still a long way to go. An IFC supported Local
Supplier Development Program (LSDP) was launched in September 2012, building upon the results of a
pilot phase conducted under the “Guinea Linkages Program”, to improve SME capacity. The next phase
of LSPD aims to expand scope and coverage, as part of the new IFC strategy that will help improve
access to financial services for SMEs through microfinance and innovative mechanisms such as leasing.
78.
MIGA continues to offer in Guinea all of its core political risk insurance product lines
(transfer restriction, expropriation, breach of contract, and war and civil disturbance). These
product lines can be used along with other World Bank products, such as IFC loans to directly support
government PPPs or IPPs, as has been the case elsewhere in the region. Moreover, through reassuring
foreign investors with concerns about governance and political risk, MIGA’s product can support the
28

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

strategic priority of stimulating growth and promoting economic diversification. As a post-conflict and
IDA country, Guinea is a strategic priority country for MIGA, and MIGA’s strategic goal of supporting
complex projects in areas such as infrastructure is also consistent with the overall CPS approach. Finally,
MIGA's Small Investment Products (SIP), which has streamlined procedures for smaller projects,
targeting SMEs, is also available to investors into the country. MIGA’s currently has an exposure
US$51.9m in Guinea, supporting a key investment in the telecoms sector.
79.
Using the Bank’s competitive advantage and to support the growth of mining related
investment in the sector, the Bank will propose an instrument toward building a sustainable
partnership and fostering coordination in sector interventions to achieve greater efficiency and
effectiveness in the Guinean transport sector. It will provide Guinea with a platform for maintaining
collaboration with development partners and sustaining the ongoing productive dialogue in the transport
sector. The proposed operation will address, inter alia: (i) the capacity issues of the ministries in charge
of transport in terms of the coordination, management, and the legal and regulatory framework of
transport sub-sectors; (ii) the integration of non-mining freight and passenger services into the on-going
mining infrastructure developments; and (iii) the design of a sustainable solution for the current transport
bottleneck issues of the port and the town of Conakry. In addition, the Bank’s support will complement
EU and AfDB support, as well as support from IDB and Arab states, which is currently largely focused
on investment projects.
Strategic Areas of Engagement 3: Strengthening Human Capital
80.
Under the third area of engagement, the Bank expects to improve access to basic social services,
long term improvement in technical skills to meet the demand of Guinea’s diversifying economy, while
continuing to create short-term support to the vulnerable population through safety nets.
81.
The Bank Group will intensify efforts to promote not only quantity but also quality of
human capital development to tackle education disparities as one of the main determinants of
poverty (see Section C). The Bank is currently preparing a comprehensive tertiary education strategy
and skills assessment to address skills needs for growth and competitiveness focusing on supply and
demand issues, governance and program diversification to meets the needs of the labor market. The
results will be used to inform the design of the new skills development project supported by the Bank
during the proposed CPS period.

The Bank plans to support the Government improve human capital, with a specific focus on
upgrading skills to meet the demands of the Guinean economy. The recent Baccalaureate (Bac) results
show that only 3,190 students passed the scientific Bac and 6,146 passed in mathematics, with an overall
success rate of 23 percent nationally across all subjects. This highlights a serious problem for a country
which needs technical and scientific manpower, knowledge and competencies to fully maximize its
natural resource potential. Predictions indicate that between 52,000 and 100,000 workers will be required
for the construction phase of the mining sector alone. These figures do not include indirect job creation
29

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

and depend on the number of projects considered (59,500 to 73,500 workers for 7 projects and 85,000 to
100,000 if all the projects were to be implemented) and the time horizon (52,000 workers for the next 6
years only). Guinea will need to upgrade the skills of youth, including the large number of unemployed as
well as recent graduates, to meet the demand of the private sector and extend the benefits of investments
in natural resources to the population. During the first year of implementation of the CPS, the Bank plans
to finance a Skills Development operation in support of youth employability in key sectors. During the
final year of the CPS, emphasis will be given to higher education with a focus on systemic governance
reforms. Basic education will be a second priority, focusing on equity and quality of learning.
83.
To strengthen the lagging human development indicators in Guinea, the Bank will continue
to be the leading partner in basic education, social protection and health. In basic education, the
Bank will start the preparation of a new Basic Education project, funded by the Global Partnership for
Education for which the Bank has been elected as the supervising entity. The Social Safety Nets project
will continue to be implemented to provide the government with a clear social protection strategy. At the
same time, the Bank plans to build on its experience and comparative advantage to support the health
sector. Health targets will aim at strengthening prevention and capacity to provide services and quality
care accessible to the entire population to reduce infant and maternal mortality, malnutrition and fight
against communicable and non-communicable diseases. At the same time, the introduction of Results
Based Financing (RBF) will support higher cost-effectiveness in the sector contributing to the broader
governance agenda. The human development program will enable the Bank to contribute to poverty
reduction through improved basic services, in response to a demand from government and in close
coordination with partners.
VI. RISK ASSESSMENT
84.
Political uncertainty and weak governance may negatively affect the CPS implementation.
With repeated delays in the organization of legislative and local elections, the political situation remains
tense, with frequent urban and communal riots sparking out of every minor incident. The risk that
political uncertainly, social tensions and a weak governance framework may spill over and impact the
reform agenda and implementation of the CPS program remains high. To mitigate this risk, the Bank will
have a hands-on approach to project management and monitoring. In addition, the Bank’s Economic
Governance TA and Mineral Governance TA operations will help provide needed institutional
development support to strengthen governance in the mining sector and the public administration.
85.
Economic management remains a challenge. Post-HIPC Completion Point, the authorities need
to improve and sustain the quality of debt management, strengthen their capacity to evaluate Government
liabilities, maintain sound macroeconomic policies, and transform the business environment. The
recurrence of external shocks and/or policy slippages as in the past and the resumption of nonconcessional borrowing could lead to the reemergence of unsustainable debt. Further, populist actions
such as the agreement with the unions in December 2012 over a 50 percent salary increase will be
difficult to manage before further stabilizing the overall macroeconomic environment. Improving the
quality of debt management, strengthened capacity to evaluate potential Government liabilities in PPP
agreements, sound macroeconomic policies, and improvement in the business environment are crucial to
achieving and maintaining a sustainable debt level. Borrowing by all Government-owned entities must
remain strictly under control of the Ministry of Economy and Finance to ensure debt-sustainability. For
the same reason, possible Government participation in mining sector projects is envisaged to be financed
only by project revenue without recourse to the budget.
86.
Exogenous factors (economic shocks and commodity prices). Guinea is exposed to many
exogenous factors, which include the continued instability in the sub-region and the country’s heavy
dependence on mining products for export revenue. Historically, such volatility was managed by long30

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

term contracts at fixed prices for bauxite exports. Exports of gold and iron ore are increasingly important
export commodities and are less likely to be managed by long-term contracts (such contracts are more
expensive). The current Bank strategy aims to help Guinea minimize the risks of external shocks by
strengthening and diversifying its export base. The liberalization of trade, particularly the strengthening of
regional trade with the ECOWAS is expected to be an important component of this strategy. The current
regional integration strategy adopted by the Bank through the rising number of regional projects is a good
way to reduce or contain exogenous shock on a particular country. Furthermore, countries can gain from
shared experience and reduce potential heavy costs related to those external shocks. For Guinea,
integrating Bank’s project within the Mano River Union is a viable strategy to encourage regional
integration and increase the role of the country in the sub-region.
87.
Finally, the financing risk linked to the availability of IDA resources should be considered.
While the anticipated allocation is based on a conservative estimate, which is based on Guinea’s current
CPIA rating of 3.0, the inability to secure the anticipated amounts would necessitate scaling down the
overall level of engagement or changing program priorities proposed in the CPS.

Annex 2: Guinea Country Assistance Strategy (2003-2006)
and Interim Strategy Note (FY11-FY12) Completion Report
Context and Objectives of the CAS
1.
The World Bank’s 2003-2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Guinea was designed to
anchor on the country’s First Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) pillars of fostering sustainable
and equitable growth, improving access and quality to basic services, and strengthening governance and
institutional and human capacity. The CAS focused on supporting selected economic and sector work, a
structural adjustment operation, and second phases of existing adaptable program loans to foster growth,
improve access to social services, and strengthen capacity and governance.
2.
The initial 2003-2006 CAS-period was going to be a period of transition required mainly to
strengthen Guinea's fiduciary arrangements in public finance management and institutional framework for
service delivery. The Bank’s Program was to move gradually towards more programmatic support by
assisting Guinea to reform its institutional and policy framework, build its capacity for service delivery,
and improve the management of public finances so that the country’s national institutions are able to
effectively implement its development programs. To support this transition, the Bank and other donors
planned to gradually move away from projects, to prepare the various sectors for a more programmatic
approach. To the extent that satisfactory public expenditure and fiduciary arrangements would be in place,
the Bank also considered moving towards future support through poverty reduction support credits.
3.
The political instability which afflicted Guinea during the 2000s thwarted the authorities’ efforts
to implement the First Poverty Reduction Strategy covering 2002-2006 (PRSP-I), the basis of the Bank’s
CAS under review. As a result, the government issued a second PRSP (PRSP-II) covering 2007-2010 in
August 2007, building on the lessons learnt from the unsuccessful implementation of the PRSP-I. In
2010, the authorities decided to extend implementation of the PRSP-II to allow more time for progress on
key indicators, especially as the period 2008-10 had been affected by numerous adverse shocks, chief
among which is continued political instability.
4.
The Bank’s 2003-2006 CAS period was never closed, owing partially to a suspension hiatus from
December 2008 to April 2011 following a military coup. The resumption of the Bank’s activities in 2011
was guided by an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY11-12 which outlined a Bank re-engagement
strategy in Guinea with the aim to support the Government’s plan for the period. The Bank pledged to
support macroeconomic stabilization and help Government to reach the HIPC completion point rapidly by
providing budget support and technical assistance, with a special focus on the areas of public financial
management, public administration, the security sector, and mining. The Bank also committed to support
a major push to boost the delivery of social services and the creation of jobs to help deliver tangible quick
wins to the citizens. This was to be done by using the existing portfolio, creating a few select new
projects, and leveraging new sources of finance. The Bank’s emphasis was going to be placed on
strengthening civil society and social accountability mechanisms and on accelerating regional integration.
Significant progress under the ISN was expected to lead to a full Country Assistance Strategy, at the end
of the ISN period.
5.
The Bank’s performance is considered to be moderately unsatisfactory because, while some of
the Bank supported programs achieved results, many were not successful, with a few are still under
implementation for more than 8 years.

37

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

Progress towards Guinea’s Long-term Development Outcomes
6.
In tracking progress towards fostering sustainable and equitable growth, it is notable that
Guinea’s performance has been erratic with economic growth strongly decelerating since 2008, to
become negative in per capita terms. Cumulatively, GDP per capita declined by 4.6 percent between 2008
and 2010. While agriculture continued to grow modestly, the mining sector - historically a major driver of
growth contracted in real terms by 6 percent between 2008 and 2010 in spite of rising world commodity
prices. The regulatory business environment worsened with the cancellations of contracts in the mining
sector, changes of license terms and conditions in the telecommunications sector, on the one hand and
political uncertainty in the context of deteriorated security situation on the other. In contrast, the
construction sector benefited from the large fiscal expansion recorded in 2009-10. The incidence of
poverty also increased, from 49 percent in 2002 to 58 percent in 2010. Recent poverty data from the
2012 Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire survey show that 55 percent of the population continue to
live below the poverty line, compared to 53 percent in 2007 when a similar survey was conducted.
7.
Second, during the review period the delivery of access and quality to basic services suffered as a
result of the budget crunch, under-paid civil servants, and faltering decentralization. Health services are
in a serious state of decay. Government spending on health (excluding external assistance) is dismally
low, having decreased from less than 1 percent of GDP in 1993 to 0.2 percent in 2010. Chronic
malnutrition in 2007 was 36 percent up from the previous survey in 2002. Less than 16 percent of the
population consulted health care workers even though 56 percent had access to services according to the
same survey. Malaria remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children. The infant
mortality rate is 101 per 1,000 (2004) and the maternal mortality rate is one the highest in Africa at 740
per 100,000. Among those accessing services, only slightly over half expressed satisfaction. The HIV
prevalence rate is low relative for the region, estimated at 1.6 percent. The government is pursuing a
policy of free access to anti-retroviral drugs but so far, public resources were not in place to finance this
policy.
8.
The recent crisis also had negative effects on education. The gross enrollment rate has stagnated
at around 79 percent since 2007 (86 percent was expected in 2010), and for girls, at around 70 percent. In
the rural areas, the rate has remained at around 60 percent over the same period. Dropout rate however
shot up from 5.9 percent in 2007 to 11.6 percent in 2010, and as a result, the primary completion rate fell
to 57 percent in 2010. Enrollment in secondary schools has also remained flat at about 44 and 25 percent
GER respectively for secondary 1 and 2 since 2007. The Technical and vocational education and training
including post-primary cycle is very weak: in 2008, the overall enrollment in this sub-sector was less than
6,000 students. Sector inefficiencies seem to have risen, especially in expenditure management and
planning with more than 90 percent of primary and secondary education recurrent expenditures spent on
salaries. It is widely suspected that public employment, especially in education, is rife with ghost workers
and double dippers.
9.
Third, progress towards strengthening governance and institutional and human capacity fell short
of expectations, as a result of years of institutional neglect, authoritarian rule, predatory behavior on the
part of senior government officials and civil servants alike and ethnic tensions. The Ibrahim Index on
African Governance ranks Guinea 42nd out of 52 African countries, reflecting a judicial system that has
been weakened by political interference and corruption. Transparency International reports that
Guinea, over the past several years, ranked at the bottom of the scale in terms of perceptions of corruption
- in 2011, it was ranked 164 out of 178 countries. A central component of this state of affairs is the
weakness of the state. The decaying public administration has lost many of its core skills. After years of
under-investment and institutional neglect, the public administration requires significant attention in order
to become an effective agent for the country’s rebirth. Serious inconsistencies between the payroll and

38

personnel data plague the public service pointing to the existence of large abuse and irregularities in the
payroll.
Program Performance
10.
The CAS Completion Report focuses on the core CAS benchmarks identified for assessing
Bank’s performance. However, the review period spans from 2003 to 2012, therefore including the FY11FY12 ISN period as well. At the ISN stage and to align the interim strategy with Guinea’s new political
and economic context, three projects were dropped from the previous CAS program, including the
Structural Adjustment Credit, the Water Support Program, the First PRSC and the Second CBSD; as well
as the Investment Climate Policy note. This was in line with the Bank’s new focus devoted to
stabilization and economic governance, and the need to clear US$74 million of arrears, a precondition to
resuming Bank activities as well as that of the IMF and other donors. Furthermore, program Results
missing any supporting instrument during the period have been dropped.
Promoting Sustainable and Equitable Growth
11.
To support sustainable and equitable growth, the Bank planned to carry out analytical work and
contribute to (a) fostering macroeconomic stability; (b) improving the investment climate through
assistance for establishment of minimum infrastructure services required for growth; (c) supporting policy
reforms in fisheries, agriculture, mining, and trade; and (d) improving rural services. These actions were
expected to help Guinea achieve an annual GDP growth rate of 5.8 percent (8 percent rural areas) by
2005.
12.
Macroeconomic stability. The Bank delivered only partially on supporting this first pillar of the
Government’s PRSP. The structural adjustment operation (FY04) which was planned to cover policy
reforms in tax administration, mining and trade, and including various activities to strengthen Guinea's
public expenditures and fiduciary framework did not materialize. However, in 2011 as part of the reengagement effort and to contribute to one of the two objectives of the ISN, namely the consolidation of
national reconciliation through building state capacity and increasing accountability, the Bank prepared a
Reengagement and Reform Program which was rated moderately satisfactory at completion. It aimed to
strengthen financial management, efficiency and accountability in the public sector and to increase
transparency in the mining.
13.
Improving rural services. The Bank also delivered on the planned rural infrastructure program
(FY04) and the second phase of the Urban Program (FY05) in the CAS. However, both projects
(P065127 and P091297) are still under implementation following restructuring. The former, which closes
on June 30, 2013, is currently rated moderately unsatisfactory in overall implementation progress, with a
disbursement lag of 37.83% or 62 months. The two Global Environmental Facility-supported projects in
support of the sustainable management of natural resources were delivered and are still under
implementation. Both are rated moderately satisfactory in overall implementation progress.
Improving Access and Quality to Basic Services
14.
To support increasing equitable access to social services, the CAS planned to strengthen the
Bank’s analytical base in support of (a) empowering urban and rural people, their local governments, and
their organizations; and (b) strengthening service delivery in specific priority sectors (health, education,
fight against HIV/AIDS, and water resource management). To that end the proposed efforts in the CAS
anticipated a second phase of the then existing health program (FY04). Hypothetically, the Bank also
suggested provision of budget support to complement the ongoing support to social sectors (the Education
for All program, and the Multisectoral HIV/AIDS program).
39

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

15.
Service delivery. The Multisectoral AIDS Program (P073378), designed to increase HIV/AIDS
knowledge and low risks behaviors and to improve the coverage and the use of HIV/AIDS prevention,
care treatment and support services, scored a moderately satisfactory rating at closing. The Education for
All program which is still ongoing, is currently rated moderately satisfactory. It aims to establish a stable
framework for good quality universal primary education.
Strengthening Governance and Institutional and Human Capacity
16.
In support to governance strengthening and institutional and human capacity building, the CAS
planned to build capacity in its broadest sense, creating conditions for effective use of existing capacity
(public and private sectors, and civil society) to deliver basic services to the poor in rural and urban areas.
To achieve this, the CAS planned to focus on cross-sectoral generic issues relating to institutional
transformation, with the ultimate goal of transforming the public sector agencies from organizations
focusing on bureaucratic control-which hinders service delivery and provides opportunities for rent
seeking, patronage, and corruption-to organizations supporting public and private service delivery to the
poor. Through the CAS, the Bank planned to focus on: (a) establishing the analytical base to support the
government's actions to strengthen governance; (b) transforming cross-cutting national institutions and
service delivery agencies; and (c) strengthening mechanisms of accountability to ensure that local
government is accountable to citizens, and operates in a transparent and participatory way. In addition, the
Bank planned to support developing statistical capacity to allow adequate monitoring and evaluation of
the PRSP implementation.
17.
Programs such as the Community Support Program and the Urban Program that involved strong
participation of beneficiaries have done somehow well in improving the quality of services and poor
people's access to these services. Such programs have also promoted gender equity, since many of the
community-identified priorities have involved measures improving the quality of women's lives, such as
maternal health services, better access to drinking water and agricultural services. These efforts also
allowed the Bank to have a decisive impact on governance at the local level. The Bank’s close
relationship with civil society was also helpful in creating the momentum for change which ultimately led
to the first free and peaceful elections in Guinea.
Results Rating
18.
The CAS Completion report rates the achievement of results foreseen in the CAS as moderately
unsatisfactory. In the absence of a proper results framework, the team proposed core CAS benchmarks to
assess Bank’s performance. Factoring in the limited context of limited information the Bank had pledged,
during the CAS period, to support the strengthening of the knowledge base and of statistical capacity,
which was going to allow establishing a stronger baseline of the various benchmarks, especially in the
area of strengthened governance and institutional capacity, and measuring the progress over the CAS
implementation period. Guinea’s statistical system continues to face major shortcomings including poor
coordination between producers and users. Persistent weaknesses are noted in terms of regularity and
timeliness of publications, modeling tools for forecasting and simulation tools for impact to better
understand the impacts of macroeconomic policies at the micro level (on households and enterprises). In
addition, the national statistical system is still confronted with the absence of methodological documents
on standards, classifications, procedures for the collection, processing, analysis and data dissemination.
Bank Performance, Design and Relevance
19.
To reach its objectives, the 2003-2006 CAS proposed a three pronged-program, comprising (a)
ongoing activities; (b) new analytical work, building on the existing knowledge base; and (c) new lending
operations. At the time the portfolio comprised eight projects representing a total commitment of
US$215.6 million in IDA allocations and US$20.3 million in grants.
40

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17

20.
The design of the CAS was in sync with the Government’s poverty reduction strategy, in that the
CAS’s pillars were mirrored against those of the PRSP. It was inspired by lessons learned from what
worked and what did not work under the previous CAS, feedback from consultations (Government and
civil society) and the client feedback survey completed a few years before. The CAS was designed to ease
the transition required mainly to strengthen Guinea's fiduciary arrangements in public finance
management and institutional framework for service delivery. To support this transition, the Bank (and
other donors) planned to gradually move away from projects, to prepare the various sectors for a more
programmatic approach. To the extent that satisfactory public expenditure and fiduciary arrangements
would be in place, the Bank also considered moving towards future support through poverty reduction
support credits.
21.
Several years through the period of the 2003-2006 CAS and many years afterwards, it is hard to
attribute the poor performance of the Bank’s program to design failings more than it is to the gradual
weakening of the state, weak institutional environment, and political instability in Guinea.
22.
Concerning the Bank’s reengagement activities, they were sequenced in time, with the more
urgent areas receiving more support in the early period in 20011. This included 9 projects that supported
improved service delivery in maternal health and basic education, and stimulating agriculture and rural
development. Re-activating the portfolio involved overall 11 retroactive extensions of closing dates and
six level 1 or 2 restructurings. The restructurings were devised in ways to improve disbursement rates,
tighten fiduciary controls, make the projects more participatory, and more generally, more adapted to the
current circumstances at the time. Following a comprehensive fiduciary review of the portfolio, existing
operations were assessed as being ready for a resumption of activities. All projects were also submitted to
the required audit reports. During the ISN period, the portfolio was simplified and organized around the
three key clusters of economic governance, jobs, and decentralized services.
Implementation
23.
The Bank’s support to Guinea’s the PRSP implementation was manifested through its lending
program and analytical and advisory services proposed in the CAS. By supporting the PRSP
implementation, the Bank also aimed to support Guinea in achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), which are consistent with the PRSP objectives. Hence, the Bank’s support to the
implementation of the PRSP was to focus on governance, transformation of country institutions, and
empowerment of beneficiaries.
24.
The delivery of AAA activities followed neither the planned timeline, nor the sector focus the
AAAs were originally designed for. Only three non-lending activities were delivered during the original
CAS period: Integrated trade framework diagnostic, Guinea integration and competitiveness study, and
strengthening public procurement. The IDF grant for accountancy was started, but did not complete.
However, additional analytical and/or advisory services activities were carried during the broader span of
time subject to the current review. They are: Strengthening fiduciary framework : support to the finance
committee of the national assembly and the chamber of accounts; Building institutional capacity for
improved management and transparency of Guinean mining sector; Scaling up SME participation in
Rural Electrification; Re-engagement technical assistance.

Bank Performance Rating
25.

The Completion Report ranks the Bank’s performance as moderately unsatisfactory.

Summary Findings and Recommendations
26.
A favorable political environment that provides the power base, incentives and commitment to
implement difficult reforms is paramount. Understanding the political economy of reform and
anticipating opposition needs to inform project planning. In a country where policy decisions are highly
centralized, the Bank should be prepared to elevate sectoral policy dialogue at the highest level and to
integrate sectoral reforms in the macro policy dialogue. The Bank should also be prepared to wait for
policy decisions to materialize at the preparation stage, before committing funding for investments even if
investment levels are relatively modest.
27.
Strengthening accountability mechanisms has been a key element of ensuring some level of
impact to donor financed activities in an environment where traditional institutional counterparts revealed
themselves to be unresponsive. Those initiatives whose reach went beyond the traditional institutional
partners fared better than those who did not.
28.
Community participation is central to reaching tangible results. Programs which involved
participation of beneficiaries (e.g. the Community Support Program and the Urban Program) that tend to
do better in terms of improving the quality of services and poor people's access to these services. Such
programs also seem better fitted for promoting gender equity, better access to drinking water and
agricultural services.
29.
Choosing lending instruments, consideration should be given to the specific sector objectives and
the overall institutional environment of the sector. While certain instruments (such as adjustable program
lending (APLs)) were seen as innovative in addressing previously identified weaknesses in traditional
project lending, financing was not always adequate to complete all activities planned in each phase.
Without presumed recourse to the subsequent phase, triggers become less meaningful and there’s a risk of
incomplete activities.
30.
Regarding design and preparation assessment of some Bank financed projects has shown that
engagement with the borrower during preparation should ensure that those involved are motivated by
providing the best assessment of the country’s needs and the likely capacity of the implementing agencies
to take on the responsibilities of executing the project. Also, there tend to be clear advantages from
keeping the design of the operations simple and well-focused on the Government priorities. Of equal
importance in this chapter are representation and voice of prime beneficiaries: local authorities and
communities should play a crucial role in the design and implementation of such projects and be
represented in the oversight committee.
31.
The involvement of the private sector, including beneficiary and producer organizations, in
service delivery helps increase the quality of services. For example, in one survey, beneficiaries of the
Community Support Program have expressed increased satisfaction with services. Garbage collection in
Conakry has improved under the Urban Program through subcontracting of the services to private
organizations. Working with the private sector will be particularly important in the future given the very
low level of capacity in the public sector.

1. Clearance of arrears to IDA facilitated.
2. Recruitment of civil servants and improvement of

1. Legal and regulatory framework of the sector needs to
be improved to promote private sector involvement in

2. Despite Government’s efforts and donors’ involvement
in the sector, effective road management has been
stymied by the lack of an overall network management
plan, and inadequate and irregular maintenance funding.
The Government will need to raise its game in order to
regulate significant investments (Roads, Rail, and Ports)
which are expected over the next 10 years from the
mining sector.

Lessons and Suggestions for new CAS
1. A strong and continuous political will is as essential for
consolidating and deepening reforms, as for initiating
them. In a country where policy decisions are highly
centralized, the Bank should be prepared to elevate
sectoral policy dialogue at the highest level and to
integrate sectoral reforms in the macro policy dialogue.
2. The Bank should also be prepared to wait for policy
decisions to materialize at the preparation stage, before
committing funding for investments even if investment
levels are relatively modest.
3. Donor coordination in supporting and deepening reforms
in the water sector is critical for the Government to
remain on track and sustain commitment to reform. Lack
of co/parallel financing and ability for donors’ action in
the country to support the deepening of the previous
reform in the water sector didn't help cement the
development of a strengthened partnership in the
Guinean's urban water supply that culminated with
performances that were lower than during the previous
project.
4. The Bank's supplemental financing did not help to
strengthen the reform process and actually gave the
wrong signal to the Government. The concept of
Supplemental Financing put too much emphasis on
technical aspects and cost control and failed to address
the bigger picture of sector development and
sustainability.

1. As part of its development program, the Government
foresees a two-phase process to strengthen
decentralization over the next 10 years. A first phase is

1. The project objectives remain achievable and are
relevant and consistent with the Government's poverty
reduction strategy and the Bank's country Assistance
strategy.
2. A project economic analysis will be carried out in
August to appreciate its efficiency before the last ISR.
3. In 2012, the scarcity of public resources (1.8 % of the
national budget) has impacted on all health indicators.
Health financing went so low that the Government was
able only to pay salaries leading, for the first time, the
country to go into vaccines shortage -- not to mention
drugs. This will be discussed again after the PER study
with the Guinean authorities.

1. Learning assessment conducted in 2012 in grades 2, 3
and 4 suggest that the Government must do more to
increase primary completion rate and achieve gender
parity, improve learning outcomes, and make education
more relevant to the needs of the labor market.
2. A relatively low share of the government budget geared
towards education and a distribution of resources
between the different education sub-sectors which is not
aligned with MDG goals is not conducive to
improvements in the sector.

1. Adequate Government’s response to the crisis given its
limited capacities.
2. Longer-term sustainability of the Government’s food
price crisis program and overall economic reform efforts
was weakened by the military coup of late 2008, which
undermine the ability of the Government to address
future food price shocks effectively.
3. Given the (anticipated and unanticipated) risks to this
operation in the country’s fragile context, close
coordination with other development partners has been
indispensable to mitigate risks, realize synergies, and
improve the leverage in the policy dialogue.
Collaboration with the IMF has also been important.
4. In the context of Guinea, the Government M&E system
worked reasonably well during the crisis but its efforts
weakened after the emergency period.

of these conditions were met.
2. The lessons learned from this project can be divided into
issues relating to design, especially for decentralization
projects, and management and supervision of such
projects in weak fiduciary environments.
1. Addressing governance challenges and restoring
confidence will be critical in establishing a lasting
stability in the country.

1. Specific impacts in the financial management system
and procedures are yet to be assessed, but are expected
to be significant, given the strong focus on program
budgeting, the elaboration of Medium Term
Expenditures Frameworks in key priority sectors, the
introduction of risk based approach and the use of the
country system for donor financed projects.
2. The country needs strong support to implement these
reforms

Outcome: introduce a system to
allow l’Ordre des Experts

and improve the quality of the
accountancy and auditing
services provided by private
Guinean firms and significantly
reduce quality control issues.

disbursement rate was 4 %.

Outcome 2: build capacity of
the Guinean Government and
key stakeholders to improve
governance and transparency in
the management of the
country’s mineral resources in a
participatory way. This would
be achieved through the
strengthening of Government’s
ability to negotiate stable and
fair investment agreements,
which would contribute to
economic development at the
national, regional and local
levels; and through the
development of a sound and
transparent revenue
management framework.

Partially achieved (on-going project)
• At least one contract negotiated using
the newly drafted standard
agreement.
• Supervision committee formed and
EITI templates adapted to Guinean
conditions.
• Guinea surpassed this indicator and
was expected to produce its second
report by June 2008.

Lessons and Suggestions for new CAS

1. Although the proposal was based on a strong request
from the Accounting profession, it was not underpinned
by a proper analytical work that would have highlighted
the main areas of focus to strengthen private sector
accounting and auditing in Guinea.
2. A comprehensive assessment such as the ROSC A&A
would have provided a better action plan and sequence
of the reforms, taking into account the implementation
capacity of key local actors.
3. Given the volatile political situation in FCS countries, it
is important to design the implementation arrangements
in such a way that political instability does not prevent
smooth implementation of the activities. One solution
could be to be very opportunistic and take advantage of
period of stability to fast track implementation.
1. Period characterized by a high level of political
instability and uncertainties in Guinea. The struggle for
power within the old regime resulted in frequent changes
of Ministers of Mines (4 in the course of the
implementation of the grant). This impacted on
continuity and resulted in added needs for supervision
and dialogue to ensure that each Ministers is aware of
past achievements

Annex 6: Summary of Gender Portfolio Review
1.
The Government of the Republic of Guinea recognizes that in order to meet its development
challenges it is critical that both women and men are able to contribute to a benefit from economic
and social development. The government’s latest PRSP has a separate section on the promotion of
gender equality and also mainstreams gender throughout much of the rest of the document. Attention to
gender issues is particularly visible with regard to the following areas: education, social protection, health
(including reproductive health and women’s vulnerability to HIV/AIDS), and women’s agricultural
productivity/contribution to household food security. The PRSP sets out its commitment to gender issues,
stating that “the promotion of women with a view toward full participation in decision-making processes
at all levels is an integral part of the government’s development policy and one of its priority areas”. The
government’s commitment to gender is also demonstrated with its publication of a national gender
strategy (GoG, 2011), and a national strategy against gender-based violence (GoG, 2010).

The World Bank believes that the integration of gender objectives and indicators into the
CPS and its Results Framework is the most effective way to maximize the accountability of the
Bank for achieving gender outcomes and to highlight and learn from those outcomes. The start of a
new CPS period now presents the Bank with the opportunity to put this strategy into practice. Integrating
gender into the CPS, particularly into the Results Framework, will allow the Bank to: (1) ensure clarity of
purpose in the overall gender-related objectives of the country portfolio; (2) ensure alignment with the
priorities of the Government of Guinea; (3) highlight progress; and (4) ensure effective accountability of
the CMU for achieving such progress.
3.
The main focus of this review is the portfolio of 11 IDA projects 13 – the review finds that 45
percent (5 out of 11) of the IDA portfolio is gender-informed in at least one of the following
dimensions: (1) analysis; (2) actions; (3) M&E. This review also looks at a number of trust-funded
and AAA activities and finds that 25 and 43 percent of these respectively are gender-informed (see
annex 1 for a matrix of key project review comments). The portfolio is supporting the following
gender-related outcomes: improved access to basic infrastructure and services; reduced gender
inequalities in education; improved understanding of the impact of cash transfers as a tool for increasing
girls’ school enrollment/attendance; improved life skills and knowledge of essential family practices
(EFP); improved delivery of maternal health care; increased productivity, incomes, and food security for
rural women; increased representation of women in teaching positions; Increased employment
13

The focus of the review is on IDA because the World Bank’s corporate targets and guidelines on the integration of
gender are specific to IDA projects (i.e. not including AAA or Trust Funds).

61

opportunities for women through public works; Increased representation of women in local rural
governments; and increased participation of women in demand for good governance in the mining sector.
4.
This review proposes the following gender vision for the CPS: The vision of the FY14-17 CPS
is to increase the proportion of IDA projects that are rated as gender-informed from 45 percent to at least
60 percent (the IDA16 minimum target) and to make the same commitment to the portfolio of AAA
activities. The CPS will demonstrate the country team’s commitment to achieving these objectives by
specifically including the proportion of gender-informed IDA projects as an indicator in the CPS Results
Framework. The specific actions that the CMU will focus on in order to achieve greater gender
integration in the portfolio will include: (1) Increasing the use of gender analysis to inform operations and
encouraging project teams to be more explicit in illustrating how gender analysis/an understanding of the
relevant gender issues influenced the design of project activities; (2) Improving the availability of existing
country level gender analysis (in order to achieve objective 1) by encouraging greater attention to gender
in AAA work . Any gender-focused AAA work could take advantage of new data from the 2012 Core
Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey; (3) Improving the explicit integration of gender into
infrastructure sector operations, so that activities take account of women’s and men’s specific and
differing infrastructure needs and vulnerabilities and maximize positive gender synergies between
different sectors (e.g. in the case of transport - access to health care, access to markets, access to
employment through public works, access to schools, and reduced time poverty); (4) Ensuring that
projects which use participatory approaches are more specific in outlining the exact mechanisms to be
used to ensure that both women and men are able to participate effectively (both in terms of numbers and
in terms of the qualitative level of their engagement) – and ensuring that projects also recognize that
women’s participation alone is not sufficient to ensure that activities are gender sensitive.
5.
The CPS will focus on the following broad objective areas, drawn from the gender
objectives highlighted in the latest PRSP and the National Gender Policy, and based on the review
of the Bank’s current portfolio of activities in Guinea - these objectives will be reflected (in line with
PRMGE’s step 3 for integrating gender into the CPS) with relevant indicators in the CPS results
framework (see annex 3):
(1) Improved basic infrastructure and services, creating cross-sector synergies and lifting barriers to
women’s and men’s economic participation, access to health care, and access to education.
(2) Reduced gender inequalities in education
(3) Improved maternal and reproductive health and improved knowledge for women and men of
HIV/AIDS and other life-skills issues
(4) Improved agricultural livelihoods for women through improvements in productivity, food
security, and livelihoods diversification
(5) Improved participation of women in local governance and in the governance of the mining sector
Figure 1 (see below) presents a brief overview of the Guinea portfolio in the form a SWOT analysis.
However, it should be pointed out that the points listed here, along with the analysis provided in the
remainder of this review, should be discussed with project TTLs and other key staff. This review was
conducted with only minimal input from TTLs and project documents cannot provide as complete and
accurate a picture as consultation with implementing staff.

In the absence of a recent Country Gender Assessments, a
gender-sensitive analysis of 2012 CWIQ survey results
could provide useful inputs for operations.
With better attention to gender issues, the portfolio’s
infrastructure projects offer an excellent opportunity to
make significant contributions to women’s economic
opportunities, health, and time-poverty.
Many projects attempt some form of participatory
process, yet there is a lack of attention to gender.
Participatory mechanisms could be easily adapted to
ensure that women are specifically identified as a target
group.
The Community-Based Land Management Project and
the Second Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support
Project present opportunities to improve the inclusion of
women in the management of water, land and other
natural resources.
Given the Bank’s previous experience of integrating
gender in extractive industries work, there should be
plenty of lessons that could be used to further strengthen
the Mineral Governance Support Project
The pipeline Integrated Growth Centers project (not
included in this review) should increase the gender rating
of the portfolio, will add to the body of impact
evaluations, and could provide useful inputs to inform
work related to women’s economic opportunities - it plans
to test the effect of the project on the incomes of womenowned SMSEs.

63

Lack of clarity in the government’s gender strategy will
require the Bank team to be especially focused and
well-informed if it is to successfully identify and
address the most critical gender issues.

“When thinking about how the World Bank can have the most impact on development results Guinea, in
which sectoral areas do you believe the World Bank should focus most of its attention and resources in
Guinea? (Choose no more than THREE)”
(Respondents chose from a list. Responses combined.)

1.
Overall alignment with perceived development priorities: Stakeholders are very clear on what
they perceive to be the most critical development priorities in Guinea. These include energy (nearly sixty
percent of respondents reported that this is the most critical contributor to growth while forty percent
noted that it is the country’s top development priority), education, and public sector governance. Rural
and agriculture development are also seen as vitally important in reducing poverty in the country.
Stakeholders report that the development areas that would benefit most from Bank involvement in terms
of resources (and knowledge) are aligned with the expressed priorities, and include education; energy and
governance are identified as key areas for Bank emphasis.
2.
Perceptions of how the Bank operates on the ground: Stakeholders appear quite satisfied with
many aspects of the Bank’s work in Guinea. These include monitoring and evaluations, using country
systems when available, follow through over time, increasing institutional capacity, and collaboration
with government and donors. In addition, research suggests that the Bank is viewed as very relevant and
aligned with development priorities on the ground, with a very well prepared staff.
64

As we see in surveys conducted in other fragile and conflict affected states, the Bank’s speed is of
greatest concern to stakeholders in Guinea. This appears to be related to disbursement of funds. Related
to this, when asked what the Bank’s greatest weakness is, respondents point equally to the speed of
processes, bureaucracy and technocratic approach in the face of political realities. In addition, as in other
FCS countries, ratings for the Bank’s responsiveness are relatively low (when compared to all other
ratings of the Bank’s work). This may be worth further discussion and exploration.
3.
Increasing the value of the Bank in Guinea: One message that emerges clearly from the data is
the perceived need for the Bank to reach out to greater groups in an environment where stakeholders
report (a full fifty percent) that in the greatest obstacle to reform is inadequate levels of citizen
participation. In fact, nearly fifty percent (a plurality) of respondents say that the top way to increase the
value of the Bank on the ground in Guinea is to reach out beyond government to other groups.
There is also significant room for the Bank to work more actively in the area of capacity development in
Guinea (seen in other FCS countries as well). Nearly half of respondents note that the primary obstacle to
reform is government inefficiency. Nearly forty percent of stakeholders say that capacity building/training
are the Bank’s greatest or second greatest value in the country (financial resources are of greatest value).
In addition a majority of respondents say that the most effective instrument in Guinea is capacity
development (equal to those who identify investment lending as the Bank’s most effective instrument).
Finally, research indicates that stakeholders believe that the Bank’s clear comparative advantage is related
to building capacity (in particular of state institutions), and related, strengthening public financial
management. This aligns well with stakeholders’ view that the most important area for the Bank to
emphasize in its knowledge is governance/reform (in contrast, stakeholders believe other donors are best
positioned to lead in stimulating dialogue to promote peace and stability).
4.
Communication: In a country where half of the respondents report that they are still using dial
up for access to the internet, it is not surprising that workshops and conferences are the preferred source
of information from the Bank (55%) followed by direct contact. This will evolve, most probably, as
technology improves, but for now it is important to recognize that substantive interaction is a critical
aspect of outreach in Guinea in terms of information and knowledge sharing.

Annex 8: Addressing Fragility across World Bank Portfolio in Guinea
1. Fragility as a cross-cutting issue
Fragility can be addressed through the projects of each sector of the portfolio by adapting program design
and implementation. At a minimum, project design should take a ‘do no harm’ approach, recognizing the
potential drivers of fragility in localities or faced by beneficiaries of the projects.
The country portfolio as a whole can be leveraged to address the drivers of fragility by embedding a
conflict-sensitive, peace-building approach into project design and management. Specific design and
management elements could include the following:
•
•

•

•
•
•

•
•

Generating tangible and visible outputs and outcomes: to address the short-term drivers of
conflict related to a breakdown in citizen-state relations, projects should be designed in such a
way that they generate tangible results that can be seen by all levels of society.
Labor intensive project design and management:
o For public works this would mean using methods that use laborers for building, road,
bridges, drainage and infrastructure. In urban environments this could also include
municipal services such as waste management and repair and maintenance of urban
facilities. The same can be said for the development of infrastructure in other sectors such
as Health and Education.
o Projects that use participatory and consultative processes can generate livelihood
opportunity by generating the need for local level facilitators
o Labor intensive methods for survey and other data collection as well as third party
monitoring of projects should also be considered.
Participatory and consultative decision making processes for decisions related to projects:
Where appropriate, projects implemented at local level need to be designed to be participatory,
consultative and transparent as possible. In practice, this would mean budgeting for an increased
number of public consultations throughout the projects as well as in a high-visibility public
information campaign.
Complaints handling: projects should have extremely robust systems to receive and manage
complaints from all levels of society. Systems would need to take into account literacy levels in
areas of implementation and should also consider having a local ombudsman.
Conflict risk monitoring and management: project design should include regular monitoring of
the social impact of the project and mechanisms to respond immediately to any potential risk of
conflict generated by the project
Maintaining flexibility to respond to situation on the ground: the design of projects should
include the ability to respond quickly. Examples could include a zero budget line item for
emergency response that can be triggered if conflicts arise, distribution of work amongst multiple
implementing agencies in order that work can be shifted between them if situations arise that
affect implementation
Embed learning and knowledge transfer into project design: By ensuring the trajectory of
project implementation includes activities to capture lessons innovative practices can be
transferred to other projects.
Increasing visibility of state actors: In areas where fragility is driven by an acute lack of
confidence in the state, projects should consider how state involvement in the project is
communicated as a means to re-establish confidence.

2. Dedicated Program for Supporting the CT to Address Fragility
As well as implementing an approach to building stability that cuts across all sectors, a standalone
program could be developed. This would introduce interventions specifically targeted at peace-building
66

and increasing stability. The program would also put in place dedicated experts and resources within the
Country Management Team to support other sector teams to address the drivers of fragility. The basic
outline of such a program is provided below for illustrative purposes.
1.
Program Objective: Increased stability is achieved by reconciliation between state and citizens
and the establishment of platforms for peaceful public and collective expression.

Program Activities:
Projects targeted at building stability
o Creating platforms for public debate – working to build capacities of CSO to act as a
channel for public expression – this work is already addressed in the Public Sector
Governance project but could be expanded. The INGO, Search for Common Ground, that
is contracted by the Government’s reform agency (HCREMA) could be engaged for work
beyond the scope of the project, to include general public outreach. Alternatively, the
scope of the project could be increased with additional funds from the State and Peacebuilding Fund SPF.
Country Team Support: Support to sector teams for addressing fragility and conflict in sector
work – provision of expertise to task teams to support better integration of stability activities in a
cross-cutting manner across the portfolio.
Fragility monitoring – liaison with other partners, data collection and monitoring to understand
fragility and conflict dynamics across the country and consider their implication for the portfolio
Regular coordination with development partners
Management of the Stability Program
Oversight by TTL (Suggest TTL of Public Sector Accountability Project, Alexandre Arrobio)
Daily management by ETC with specialist knowledge on Guinea and state and peace-building
expertise, supported by an ETT (to be hired)
Regular coordination meetings with peace-building focal point from each sector team
Regular coordination meetings with CMU
Funding the Program

Sources of funding:
• Korean Trust Fund: Operational budget to fund TTL time, ETC and ETT and analytical work,
including fragility monitoring, impact evaluation and development of a baseline. This could also
fund further consultations with government and civil society actors for project design (maximum
budget US $450,000)
• State and Peace-building Fund (SPF): Funds to support task teams to adapt projects and TA for
the Government where necessary
• Bank budget – it will be necessary to identify Bank budget for supervision of projects

CASA Program: Established presence on the ground in October 2012 to strategically manage AS interventions in
Guinea, providing cross business line strategic support and AS portfolio supervision. In this context, the Guinea
Conflict Analysis Report, under finalization, will inform our interventions moving forward to support the IFC
Guinea strategy.
Investment Climate Program (IC): Aims to establish an enabling environment for SMEs to grow through two
components: (i) Business regulatory reform program and (ii) Investment policy and tax reform program. The
program will make it easier and less costly for firms (especially SMEs) to start and operate their businesses
formally; establish and support an “Investment Climate Reform” operating Committee; develop an effective
investment policy letter that will drive an attractive investment code, rationalize the investment incentives regime to
benefit strategic investments, and support the development of an SME taxation system and an effective tax appeal
system that is conducive to encouraging economic activities, especially for the mining value-chain.
Local Supplier Development Program: Support mining related supplier linkages, community development,
ensuring that concession activity around mining contributes positively to broadening and deepening the domestic
Guinean private sector, and that the capacity of local suppliers (SMEs) is strengthened in order to participate in the
supply chains of international mining companies. IFC will build capacity of 100 SMEs in Conakry, Forecariah and
Beyla during the period from January to June 2013. IFC has trained around 300 SMEs to date and over 1000
participants through IFC Business Edge and other activities.
Leasing Program (Pipeline): Activities aim to promote the leasing market as an alternative financing solution in
Guinea. The leasing law was promulgated in February 2012 and a launching mission of program implementation is
planned in May 2013, starting with the development of a leasing finance framework.
Public-Private Partnerships (PPP/Pipeline): The program aims to increase private sector participation in
providing and rebuilding infrastructure. In conjunction with the WB, the IFC team conducted a mission in October
2012 to assess PPP opportunities, with a particular focus on the transport, water, tourism, health and education
sectors. The PPP team is in discussions with the GoG on the establishment of a PPP unit, which will implement
institutional and regulatory frameworks to build an environment conducive to PPP activity.
Simfer: Support the development of the Simandou project and Simandou-related transport infrastructure while the
WB supports sector governance.
Semafo: Support independent power projects (e.g. Semafo’s Poudalde hydropower). However, at this stage they
have decided to wait for the outcome of the legislative elections to proceed prior to firming up potential interest.
SGHI: IFC is currently considering additional investment in the hotel for the renovation project, however, issues
pertaining to the nature of the renovation and the GoG and Accor’s contribution to the financing of the hotel need to
be resolved as a prerequisite.
Palma Guinea (Pipeline): This is a Greenfield 303-room US$61 million 5-star Sheraton hotel project in the district
of Kipé in Conakry. IFC is considering a loan package of up to US$26 million with a US$15 million-A loan and
US$11 million-B loan. The project was presented to the IFC Credit Committee on April 19, 2013; the Transaction
team is actively working towards a closing by the end of this fiscal year.
Agribusiness project (Pre-Pipeline): IFC is interested in developing agribusiness investment opportunities in
Guinea where high potential exists and a scoping mission was conducted in end of April 2013.
Ecobank Guinea: The Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) Guarantee Facility for Ecobank Guinea (FY2012)
was designed to assist Ecobank Guinea’s trade operations by providing guarantees that cover the payment risk in
trade transactions, thus enabling the continued flow of trade credit into the Guinean market.

Annex 10: Summary of Guinea Conflict Analysis: a private sector perspective/ IFC
The democratic elections of 2010 brought Guinea back into donors and investors' radars, after five
decades of political turbulences. This renewed interest in Guinea is justified by its strategic value in a
world hungry of natural resources, energy and agricultural supplies. The country has an enormous mineral
potential, including the second world reserves of bauxite, gold, cobalt and Iron ore, just to name a few.
Offshore oil prospects are also tantalizing. Yet, the business climate is still recovering from the deep
effects of the country's troubled history but it could also fall into chaos if the current political stalemate is
not resolved. Restoring business confidence and the conditions of growth is the challenge faced by the
new government in a context of high expectations for social change, justice, jobs and better livelihoods.
The reform cliff is inevitable in order to mitigate conflict risks on the fragile future.
This study attempts to understand the main drivers without which conflicts would not exist, or their
impact on the private sector would be less deterrent to investors. While looking at the drivers of political
and social tensions in Guinea, the study also examines the levers of an enabling environment for doing
business with confidence and a sustainable impact in lifting up the society from poverty.
I.

Determinants of conflict and instability and their consequences

Guinea has successfully avoided large scale civil or military conflict in the past fifty four years. However,
political uncertainty has remained the most prevalent factor of conflict analysis and risk to business
development in the country. Generally, five key periods and political regimes delineate the timeline of the
post-colonial history of Guinea, each with polarized figures, political turmoil and uncertainty affecting
private sector development: 1958-1984: President Ahmed Sékou Touré's socialist experience and
totalitarism; 1984-2008 Military rule of Colonel Lansana Conté, failed hope for reforms, established
the laissez-faire and a legacy of military repression and impunity; 2008-2009 Captain Dadis Camara’s
interlude of accelerated social turmoil and confusion; 2009-2010 General Sékouba’s handover of
power to civilians; 2010-2013 Professor Alpha Condé, winner of the free and fair elections heads the
Fifth Republic and comes with great expectations from people. However he faces a difficult question: “Is
it possible to change Guinea?”
The extreme expectations for reform and social justice might be perilous for the new civilian regime. It
still has to negotiate its way through the complex meanders of a sixty year old political dynamics of
power, dependency and survival, particularly the ethnic elites and the military. The political timeline of
Guinea constitutes the backdrop of conflicts and social tensions which can be grouped into five sensitive
bubbles or vicious circles of conflict drivers that are in turn closely interwoven with ten main business
risks mapped in this study. These bulbs are reviewed with their consequences as follow: Political
governance; Social expectations and grievances; Natural resources and the notion of a national
cake; Regional and external factors and finally Asymmetric factors which are still not fully understood
but critical.
1. Political Governance
1. Institutional Power Sharing and lack of counter powers. For over fifty years, the Presidency and the
army have consistently dictated on the legislature and the judiciary with deep consequences on the
volatility of the business climate, affecting particularly big businesses.
2. Ethnic cleavages. The country has successfully resisted ethnic persecution. However, the 2010
Presidential election revealed major cleavage between the main candidates along ethnic lines. The
dangerous effects have persisted into today's tensions and social violence bringing fear and causing losses
to businesses.
3. Polarization of the Presidency. The excessive concentration of power at the Presidency has
characterized all Guinean regimes.
70

4. Impoverished and Predatory State. Since independence in 1958, the State has been the main source
of jobs in Guinea. But it does not pay. In the streets, people say: “The State pretends to pay Guineans.
Guineans pretends to work.” The impoverished State has developed numerous predatory strategies to
compensate low wages through corruption and extortion.
5. The military. Guinea has a long history of military coups and military involvement in government and
business, similar to South East Asia.
6. The culture of impunity. The dominance of the Presidency and the military over the judiciary has
created an entrenched culture of impunity.
2. Social expectations and grievances
7. Poverty and social insecurity. Despite vast mineral resources, a great potential in agriculture and
fisheries, Guinea remains poor, ranking 178 out of 187 countries in the UNDP’s Human Development
Report, with an HDI of 0.344, well below the sub-Saharan African average of 0.463 and the world
average of 0.682.
8. Inequalities and Social injustice. Sharp contrasts are traditionally part of the Guinean social
landscape. However, the polarized political system has generated a deep gap between the have and have
not. The Gini index in Guinea is still around 40%, much higher than Norway’s 26% but better than the
56% found in Central African Republic 14. The loss due to inequalities in income is estimated at 31.1%,
putting Guinea similar to Burundi respectively ranked 178 amongst 186 countries in the world1. Real
unemployment is very high, hidden by the informal sector. Only 49% among women and 58% among
men are actively employed 15. However about 70% of the active population is involved in informal sector
activities. Finally the bank services cover less than 20% of the informal sector’s estimated demand 16.
9. Lack of Basic Social Services. A few indicators describe the acute lack of access to basic social
services: in education, health, housing, water and sanitation. Infant mortality is too high, 130 per thousand
in 2010. The combined public expenditure on health (0.6%) and education (2.4%) is just 3% of GDP 17.
10. Regional disparities. Most development in Guinea has taken place in the coastal ecological region
around Conakry, Kindia and Boke. Central, Upper and Forest Guinea regions have received less
investment and are typically rural. The dry savannah Upper Guinea is the poorest region. Deep disparities
continue to exist between urban and rural Guinea. About 69% of Guineans live in rural areas which are
also the poorest.
3. Nationalistic approach to natural Resources and the economic cake
11. Nationalistic approach to natural resources. The Guinean elite and patronage network have
maintained a nationalistic view of controlling natural resources.
12. Polarization on Mining & Oil Sector. Minerals are by far the largest exports of Guinea. The control
or access to mining and oil resources has continued to polarize Guinean elites, civil and military.
13. Sharing the economic cake. Like in other African countries with a large indigenous trading sector,
the control of importations and the transport services polarized the business elite and is a source of
conflicts.
4. Regional and External factors

14. External conflicts and internal dynamics. Strategically, Guinea has been able to contain the effect
of political instability and war affecting its neighbors, but it has paid a high cost for it. Monitoring
regional stability remains a priority.
5. Asymmetric factors
15. The informal sector and political actors. The unprepared transition from Socialism to a liberal
economy led to a ballooning informal sector, the laissez-faire and impunity.
16. The cash economy. The economy is mainly driven by trade, agriculture and the informal sector,
which all rely on cash transactions, out of the banking system.
17. Relations between State and business leadership. Traditionally, the Strong State in Guinea has seen
key private business leaders as “partners” or “opponents
II.

Hotspots of political and social risks to business development

The ongoing increased polarization of the Presidential role is a traditional trend justified by the need to
secure guarantees at the most senior political level for the large investment at stake. But it comes with the
risk of political uncertainty. The notion of risk here relates to the level of uncertainty induced by the
drivers of political conflicts and social unrest that may reduce performance predictability of the private
sector’s investments and projects or drive markets down.
1. Political instability
Four major trends should be monitored in priority in 2013:
18. Confidence in the Presidential leadership and the governance system. Despite tangible
achievements in just two years, key challenges are still ahead:
1. The legislative elections have repeatedly been delayed since 2011, leaving the country
without an elected Parliament. The Conseil National de Transition (CNT) cannot play the role of
a legislature.
2. Continued delay of the establishment of an independent judiciary which is the foundation of
the rule of law.
3. Lack of resolve in fighting corruption. The President is expected to move on the fight against
corruption and limit the power of patronage networks so deeply entrenched in Guinea.
19. Social expectations: After long negotiations with trade unions threatening the mining sector, the
government reached an interesting deal at the end of 2012 for a phased 50% increase of salaries in 2013,
but tensions will continue.
20. Political tensions and clashes. With the backdrop of expected reforms, social hardship, the fight for
political power and the role of the military, exacerbated rivalries and clashes are likely to make the overall
issue of political stability a major risk.
21. Transforming the army. This will remain a major challenge.
2. Conflict risks for IFC
The magnitude of IFC’s investment in the mining sector in Guinea makes it inevitable to face the broader
reality of conflict risks in Guinea. Three risks appear in priority: reputation; slow or no delivery of
social dividends from investments and a limited flexibility for an exit strategy. Working in conflict

72

affected countries put investors, the private sector and even humanitarian and development actors at risk
if targeted populations perceive them as a substitute to government social responsibilities.
A well-planned exit strategy is a mitigation tool that helps visualize and manage when to get involved,
when to exit and how to do so in transferring a sustainable capacity to people. In the Context of the lack
of clarity on accompanying infrastructures, business and social services around major investments, an exit
strategy will identify the challenges and opportunities for a handover to receiving societies. In Guinea,
IFC will continue to face the combined expectations of the government and people around its
investments, particularly Simandou, in a dynamic and unpredictable way. Added to this nationalistic
sentiment may encourage the “right to ask” attitudes.
3. Top ten risks in Guinea for business in 2013
In general, the business and investment climate in Guinea faces ten top risks identified through the
analysis of the drivers of political and social conflicts.
1. Political volatility. There will be increased uncertainty in predicting performance variability for long
term investment and projects, particularly in the Oil & Mining sector. Being able to maintain a dialogue
between investors, business and the country's governance system will be essential.
2. Rule of law. The judiciary vacuum is likely to persist with short term impact on the ability to protect
deals depending on national laws.
3. Resource nationalism. Like in many resource-rich countries, the increased opportunities and demand
for deals will also increase the complexity of negotiating with the government. Some existing deals might
be at risk. The pressure for enticements will increase along with the request for free infrastructures and
social services to people.
4. Social license to operate. Recent trends of social expectations will continue to grow with a culture of
“right to ask” or social license obligations. A reactive approach to such demand could be very costly as
both government and communities feel it legitimate to adopt such attitudes.
5. Skills shortages. The shortage of skills is one of the major consequences of four decades of failure in
the education system in Guinea. In the short and medium term, business and projects will continue to face
a cliff to find qualified labor.
6. Infrastructure access. For companies operating in Guinea, the lack of infrastructure with high impact
on supply chains will remain a great challenge particularly transportation, power, water and
telecommunications. The size of the funding requirements to address these gaps indicated the need for a
concerted approach between government and stakeholders, whereby economies of scale could be made in
sharing infrastructures.
7. Cost inflation. The increased demand of supply for projects is likely to initially push up importations
in Guinea. Conflicts may appear in relation to who will control that market. Ultimately, this added to
other structural factors such as the increasing oil prices will put a burden on companies to control costs.
8. Fraud and corruption. Progress in the fight against corruption is likely to be slow. Companies will
continue to face red tape and negotiate their ways in a complex environment.
9. Sharing the benefits. Locally, this is understood as sharing the cake, particularly in a context where
communities have rarely seen a successful job creating venture for the past forty years. Associated risks
of high costs of suppliers, labors and social license obligations could be a real threat.
10. Finance and credit risk. The high level of capital involved in Guinean projects is associated with
proportional risks. Further, it is likely that the country and stakeholders will need more funds to move
73

projects forward. The local private sector and banking industry will face enormous challenges in
mobilizing capital for Guinea given the existing regulations. Finally, the size of the informal economy,
the opacity of transactions will continue to make it difficult to measure credit risk or use traditional credit
risk decision-making tools, for lack of reliable data.
4. Win-win Conflict Mitigation Levers and Sustainable Opportunities for Business
A substantial level of uncertainty will continue to affect business predictability in the medium term.
Therefore donors and stakeholder support to political dialogue, institutional reforms and the
transformation of the army will pave the way to a greater business confidence. The main challenge facing
the government is how to establish the conditions for the emergence of a sustainable business ecosystem
in Guinea. In the context of a stable and reforming Guinea there are many opportunities for IFC as a
catalyst of increased investment and sustainable growth in Guinea, working with the government, the
private sector and financial institutions. The challenge is targeting priority interventions and keeping a
focus on multipliers of sustainable change that are tangible to the demanding society for jobs and better
living conditions.
The following sectors offer great growth opportunities to the private sector in Guinea for both local and
international investments: Mining and Oil; Banking; Building and Infrastructure, Agriculture and Food
Processing; Manufacturing Industries; Retail Distribution; Transport and Logistics Services; Mobile
Telecommunications; Tourism; Technical Training and Education; Technical Support Services and
Security Services. IFC intervention could contribute help Guinea avoid the conflict trap through its risk
mitigation tools. In this context, CASA completed recently the Guinea Conflict Analysis Report which

Annex 12: Statistical Development in Guinea
Current Status and Planned Activities over the CPS Period

1.
The Guinea National Statistic Development Strategy (Stratégie Nationale de Développement
de la Statistique, SNDS) was prepared in 2008 for the period between 2009 and 2013. The diagnostics of
the statistics sector and the vision for the sector development have not been updated since, nor is there a
review prepared to evaluate SNDS implementation.
2.
The 2008 SNDS envisioned a coherent national statistical system, well-coordinated with a
capacity to produce and disseminate reliable statistics to meet the growing data demands of all users. The
action plan of the NSDS was based on five strategic pillars: (1) improvement of the institutional and
regulatory framework for the national statistics system; (2) improved coverage and quality of statistics
produced; (3) strengthening of the personnel, material, and financial resources of the national statistics
system; (4) improved dissemination and archiving of data through the use of new information and
communication technologies; and (5) mobilization of resources from technical and financial partners for
implementation of the SNDS.
3.
SNDS had prioritized 7 areas of improvements for the National Institute of Statistics (INS),
including: (1) improving the institutional and organizational arrangements for better coordination of
statistical activities; (2) improving the coverage and quality of statistical production in accordance with
international standards; (3) improving working conditions in the statistical system (infrastructure,
equipment, furniture, logistics); (4) promoting statistical training, including training in specialized schools
of statistics, demography and applied economics, on-job learning opportunities, and recruitment and
retention of a large number of statisticians with professional status; (5) improving processing capabilities,
archiving, analysis, and dissemination of statistics by adopting ICT; (6) strengthening analytical and
research skills; and (7) promoting statistical literacy. It is well recognized, however, little has been
accomplished in these seven strategic areas by INS since the implementation of SNDS.
4.
Five years after launching SNDS, lack of reliable and relevant statistics for timely inputs to
policy making remains one of the fundamental development challenges in Guinea. The World Bank
CPS identified many gaps in statistics production and their impact on development. These include the
delay in the publication of the national accounts and weak economic analysis tools (no publishing
industry statistics, index of industrial production and lack of predictive model short-term). Insufficient
knowledge of the informal sector is a serious handicap especially since it contributes more than 60
percent of GDP and provides most jobs. The weakness of the structures responsible for producing
statistical information in key sectors such as mining is a serious handicap in achieving sectoral policy
objectives such as Extractive industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). It is the same in growth sectors
such as tourism, transport and public works where the lack of a reliable information system does not
encourage investment. In the field of demographic and social statistics, production statistics of
employment and treatment of vital events remain a concern. Health statistics remain the weakest link in
social statistics because of their incomplete coverage and the irregularity of their publication. In the field
of water, energy and the environment, there is a lack of an integrated statistical system in the rural sector
and the existence of a multitude of projects on to systems information causing duplication and permanent
contradictions. With the last annual agricultural survey dating from 1997, it is impossible to carry out
regular monitoring of food production in a context of food crisis. There is also an imbalance in the
collection of fisheries data, essentially limited to sea fishing. Finally, the availability of statistics on the
environment remains largely insufficient.
5.
There are low standards of statistical production, marked by the absence of methodological
documents relating to standards, classifications and procedures for collecting, processing, analyzing and
disseminating data. Additionally, low skilled human resources, material and financial resources are
characteristic of the statistical system. Chronic underinvestment in infrastructure is also a major handicap
88

for statistical production. There is a real gap between user needs and supply of disaggregated data at subnational and micro levels. This gap seems to be widening with the revitalization of decentralization.

6.
Given the scope of statistical capacity deficit in Guinea and limited resources, the strategy
of the World Bank statistical support will be focusing on limited areas where differences could be
made independent of the low in-country capacity and limited financial resources. These supports
could serve as catalytic activities, paving the road for future support when opportunities present.
7.
First, the Bank will take a lead in preparing a review on the status of the institution, capacity,
financing, production, and dissemination of statistics in Guinea, as well as the implementation of the
NSDS 2009-2013 and donor coordination in statistics support. Based on the review, recommendations
will be made for targeted strategic statistics support for INS with suggestion of possible areas
coordination with other development partners and highlight government’s role in financing of statistics
and internal use.
8.
Second, the Bank will prepare an analytical work aiming at recovering the comparability of the
four household surveys conducted in 1994, 2002, 2007 and 2012. Because the first two household surveys
were LSMS and the last two were Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire (CWIQ) surveys, the reliability
of poverty trend based on these four surveys is currently in question. The analytical work will examine
possible sources of incomparability, including questionnaire design, prediction error, and sampling error
of LSMS and CWIQ. In addition to examining the incomparability issues in consumption aggregates, the
analytical work will also examine the comparability of other variables critical to shared prosperity,
including employment and access to services. Recommendations will be made for the future household
surveys in Guinea in regard to sampling and survey instrument design. Attention will also be paid to the
fragile political balances of the country, exploring the relevance and feasibility of using recently proposed
micro-level surveys to measure conflicts.
9.
Third, based on the review described above, the government’s priority initiatives and World
Bank areas of engagement, there would be a focused effort to develop the statistics requirements to
support decision–making in one particular policy area that the CPS is supporting. Bank could provide
support in producing, analyzing and disseminating statistics in this area. Other possibilities would be to
focus on improving human development indicators collected through household surveys or
complementing the ongoing public expenditure review analysis by strengthening the administrative data
that would be used for public investment decisions. If the effort is successful, it would be possible to then
build on that success in other areas.
