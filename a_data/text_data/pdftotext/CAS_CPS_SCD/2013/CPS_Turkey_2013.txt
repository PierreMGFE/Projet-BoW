EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Turkey’s rapid growth and development over the last decade is one of the success stories of
the global economy. Today, Turkey is an upper middle income country with a population of 75 million
and a gross domestic product of US$735 billion, making it the 16th largest economy in the world. It is the
Government’s stated intention that Turkey becomes one of the world’s 10 largest economies by 2023, the 100th
anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. Turkey is an EU accession candidate country, a member
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the G20, and an increasingly
important donor of bilateral Ofﬁcial Development Assistance (ODA). Turkey is one of the largest middle
income partners of the World Bank Group (WBG).
ii.
Turkey faces signiﬁcant economic risks going forward, including spillover from the European debt
crisis. With low domestic savings, Turkey’s economic growth relies on capital inﬂows to ﬁnance investments
and growth. The country’s large current account deﬁcit and the composition of its ﬁnancing remain critical
concerns. A weak outlook for global activity and more severe international funding strains have the potential
to spill over to Turkey. Turkey’s dependence on external ﬁnancing has left the country prone to boom-bust
cycles, and the key challenge going forward is to deliver a soft landing, from the high growth rates in 2010
and 2011.
iii.
Other countries, notably in the Middle East and North Africa, are looking to Turkey, with its gains
in income and social outcomes in recent years, as an interesting development model to emulate. Per capita
income almost tripled in less than a decade and now exceeds US$10,000. The Government’s 2023 ‘vision’
aims for per capita income to reach US$25,000. Poverty decreased from 28.1 percent in 2003 to 17.1 percent
in 2008, increasing by 1 percentage point to 18.1 percent in 2009 as a result of the global crisis. It is expected
to have fallen since then as labor markets, the main channel through which the crisis affected households,
recovered quickly, with seasonally adjusted unemployment at 9.1 percent and the employment rate at 45.4
percent in October 2011, improving on pre-crisis levels. Economic growth and social policies are behind these
achievements. The results of the nation-wide Health Transformation Program launched in 2003, for example,
include remarkable gains in the health status of the Turkish people, particularly among women. At the same
time, regional, gender, and other disparities persist, and inequality remains a challenge.
iv.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) aims to contribute to Turkey’s goal of fast, sustainable and
inclusive growth that respects the environment. Its design reﬂects priorities established in Turkey’s own
development frameworks, notably the Ninth Development Plan 2007- 20131 and the 2012-2014 Medium-Term
Program (MTP), and is intended to be ﬂexible to adapt to changes. The main criterion for WBG support in
Turkey is its ‘strategic value-added’, through a combination of ﬁnancing, analysis and advice, implementation
support to help address development challenges, and the sharing of global experience to provide benchmarks
and help inform the development and implementation of policies and programs.
v.
The CPS has three main strategic objectives and pillars: enhanced competitiveness and employment;
improved equity and public services; and, deepened sustainable development. In pursuit of these objectives,
the Turkish government, private sector, civil society and the WBG plan to work together toward ten key
outcomes during the four-year CPS period, as set out in Figure A.

The Tenth Development Plan starting 2014 is under preparation.

vi.
Strategic Objective 1: ‘Enhanced Competitiveness and Employment’. Planned CPS activities include:
(i) support for the adoption and implementation of the National Employment Strategy currently under
preparation with Development Policy Loan (DPL) ﬁnancing and analytical and advisory activities (AAA).
The aim is to enhance productive employment, particularly the activation of low-skilled youth and women
into formal employment and the expansion of employment activation programs, focused on skills upgrading;
(ii) support for investment and business environment reforms and the completion of the review of the national
competition policy framework; and, (iii) provision of medium and long-term funding to Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) and exporters.

Cross-cuƫng : Sharing Turkey’s Experience – Results, Knowledge and Capacity

vii.
Strategic Objective 2: ‘Improved Equity and Public Services’. Planned CPS activities include: (i)
increasing ﬁnancing for early childhood education (ECE); (ii) strengthening the Ministry of Health’s
stewardship functions (not its role as service provider); (iii) the development and implementation of the
private sector gender equity certiﬁcation program; and, (iv) analytic and advisory work on state-ownedenterprises (SOE) governance.
viii.
Strategic Objective 3: ‘Deepened Sustainable Development’. Planned CPS activities include: (i) policy
advice and ﬁnancing to address energy, environmental and climate change challenges in a more integrated
manner; (ii) support for the completion of a water basin management strategy; and (iii) analysis, advice, and
investment ﬁnancing, by IBRD and IFC, for the Sustainable Cities Program, which is grounded in Turkey’s
Integrated Urban Development Strategy and Action Plan 2010-2023.
ix.
‘Sharing Turkey’s Experience – Results, Knowledge and Capacity’ is a dimension of the CPS that
cuts across all three objectives. Turkey and the World Bank are exploring avenues to collaborate in sharing
Turkey’s successful economic and social reforms. Two areas of particular focus include: health sector policy,
reform, and performance; and disaster prevention and mitigation. The WBG intends to use its global network
to work with Turkey in sharing these experiences and successes with a wider international audience.

v

x.
While Turkey will remain a large-scale borrower during this CPS period, the role of analytical
and advisory activities will grow in relative terms. Knowledge services and technical assistance add value
through the provision of analysis, global experience, and hands-on implementation support. Reﬂecting the
Government’s ongoing demand for analytical and advisory services, the share of AAA spending in IBRD’s total
work program budget for Turkey steadily increased over the last four years. Responding to the Government’s
request for continued high levels of IBRD ﬁnancing, the CPS FY12-15 envisages an IBRD ﬁnancing program
in the order of up to US$4.45 billion. IFC’s own-account investment program in Turkey is expected to remain
in the range of US$425-500 million a year or, US$1.7-2.0 billion for the CPS period.
xi.
What we can learn from the past partnership with Turkey. The WBG is most effective when it
combines the skills of its three arms: IBRD, IFC and MIGA. Opportunities for mutually complementary work
are high in areas such as supporting SMEs, exporters, and energy efﬁciency investments, which will continue
to feature prominently in the new CPS. Lessons from the FY08-11 CPS include:
• The systematic development and maintenance of a policy dialogue in support of long-term strategic
goals, combining knowledge and lending operations, are vital to support reforms.
• The new engagement on environment and climate change, which started during the previous CPS,
illustrates the importance of identifying strategic entry points for policy dialogue and seizing
opportunities to strengthen engagement as country priorities evolve.
• An increased focus on monitoring and evaluation (M&E) during the last CPS period, welcomed by the
Turkish authorities, resulted in a deepening of the Turkey-WBG partnership.
• In a number of ﬁelds Turkey’s policies and reforms, some of which were conducted in partnership with
the WBG, have gained international recognition. This provides an opportunity for Turkey and the WBG
to work together in sharing knowledge and experience with countries in the region and further aﬁeld.
xii.
The outcomes of this CPS are subject to signiﬁcant external economic risks. Increasing global
uncertainty and deteriorating prospects for economic growth and stability in Europe and other developed
economies create downside risks to global demand for Turkish exports, to output growth and correspondingly
ﬁscal performance, and to the availability of international private capital ﬂows to ﬁnance Turkish investments.
The key to mitigating the most severe risks of further global economic disruption lies in sound economic
management – and in particular measures to contain and reduce the current account deﬁcit. Over the medium
term, increased productivity, the expansion and diversiﬁcation of exports, higher domestic savings, and
greater energy efﬁciency and diversiﬁcation of energy sources are the keys to reducing Turkey’s reliance on
external ﬁnance. Turkey faces political and economic risks to the effective implementation of complex and
challenging reforms – which can however be mitigated through systematic policy dialogue, participatory
project preparation and implementation and evidence-based analytic work. Turkey also faces signiﬁcant risk
of natural disaster as the recent, tragic earthquakes in the Van region have shown.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT
Country Background and Political & Social Context
1.
Turkey’s rapid growth and development over the last decade is one of the success stories of the
global economy. Today, Turkey is an upper middle income country with a population of 75 million and a
gross domestic product of US$735 billion, making it the 16th largest economy in the world. Per capita income
almost tripled in less than a decade and now exceeds US$10,000. Standard & Poor’s upgraded Turkey’s
local currency credit rating to investment grade in September 2011.2 Turkey has already met the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) for maternal and infant mortality as well as universal primary education, and
is well on the way towards meeting its other MDGs by 2015. Turkey is an EU accession candidate country,
a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the G20, and an
increasingly important donor of bilateral Ofﬁcial Development Assistance (ODA).3 Turkey is one of the largest
middle income partners of the WBG.
2.
Economic growth has been aided by a long period of political stability. In June 2011, the Justice
and Development Party (AKP) won a mandate for a third-term of single-party government, with 327 seats in
Turkey’s 550 seat unicameral Parliament. Constitutional reform is high on the agenda. The Turkish people
approved an earlier package of constitutional reforms by referendum in September 2010. Parliament started
work on a new constitution in October 2011 and expects to complete a draft by the end of 20124. Approval
of constitutional changes or a new constitution will require a two-third parliamentary majority (367 votes or
more), or a 60 percent majority (330 votes or more) and adoption in a public referendum.
3.
Turkey’s regional and global role is growing. Turkey has set out to strengthen relations with countries
in the region, broadening its engagement with the Middle East and increasing its presence in Africa, the
Balkans, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. Recent political developments in the Middle East and North Africa
have focused regional and worldwide attention on Turkey’s political and economic system, inspiring other
countries. Prime Minister Erdoğan acknowledged this interest in his June 2011 election victory speech, which
outlined Turkey’s willingness to extend and deepen ties across the region.
4.
Turkey made gains in social outcomes - supported by a decade of economic growth. Poverty
decreased from 28.1 percent in 2003 to 17.1 percent in 2008 (using the national poverty line), but remained
unchanged in rural areas. Extreme poverty has virtually disappeared. Inequality has declined but still remains
a challenge. The crisis affected households mainly through the labor market. It led to a one percentage point
increase in the poverty rate in 2009 according to ofﬁcial estimates. Although more recent ﬁgures are not yet
available, poverty is likely to have come down after the crisis, as labor markets recovered quickly, with the
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate falling to 9.1 percent and the employment rate rising to 45.4 percent
by October 2011, improving on pre-crisis levels. Economic growth, social policies, and the nation-wide

S&P raised Turkey’s local-currency rating by one notch to BBB in September 2011 citing ‘continuing improvements’ in the country’s ﬁnancial
industry and the expansion of local debt markets.
Turkey’s ODA increased almost 15-fold from US$67 million in 2003 to US$967 million in 2010 and is predominantly bilateral (2010: US$920
million bilateral versus US$47 million multilateral). The largest bilateral recipients are Afghanistan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Pakistan, followed by
Kazakhstan and Iraq. Turkey’s contribution to International Development Association’s (IDA) 16th replenishment was US$15.5 million, a share
of 0.06 percent, the same as it was in IDA15.
The Parliamentary Commission charged with drafting a new constitution aims to complete a draft by 2012.

2

Health Transformation Program launched in 2003, are behind these achievements. The health status of the
Turkish people has improved, particularly that of women. Maternal mortality fell from 29 deaths per 100,000
live births in 2005 to 16.4 deaths in 2010, while infant mortality fell from 25 deaths in 2005 to 10.1 deaths in
2010, meeting the MDG targets for maternal and infant mortality. There has also been an increase in access to
education, particularly among girls: Turkey has virtually achieved universal primary education and increased
secondary school enrollment to 69 percent.
5.
European Union (EU) accession continues to be a priority. Turkey has a deep-rooted relationship
with the EU. The EU is Turkey’s largest economic partner, accounting for 46 percent of Turkish trade in
2010. Turkey became a candidate for full membership in the EU at the Helsinki summit in 1999. Accession
negotiations began in October 2005 and continue to progress, albeit slower than Turkey would like. Following
the June 2011 elections, the Government upgraded the institution which oversees EU accession into the new
Ministry for EU Affairs. Negotiations on 13 chapters of the Acquis Communautaire are currently open. One
of the 35 Chapters (Chapter 25: Science & Research) has been opened and provisionally closed. Turkey is
determined to continue its reforms on the way to EU accession, its strategic objective. Turkey has beneﬁted
signiﬁcantly from deepening integration with the EU through growing sophistication of both exports and
imports and access to ﬁnancing5.

II. ECONOMIC CONTEXT
6.
While Turkey beneﬁts from strong private and public sector balance sheets, an externally-ﬁnanced
demand boom has recently weakened Turkey’s resilience. Strong growth over the 2010-11 period has led
to a fast widening current account deﬁcit. In the current uncertain external economic environment, risks to
growth (particularly in 2012) are signiﬁcant. Recent economic developments are discussed below, followed
by a discussion of medium-term prospects and risks.
Recent Economic Developments
7.
Turkey’s macroeconomic policies and structural reforms over the past decade have yielded robust
economic growth. Real GDP growth averaged nearly 7 percent during 2003-07, up from 4 percent during
the 1990s. Growth resumed rapidly after the 2008-2009 global crisis, at 9 percent in 2010 and 9.6 percent in
the ﬁrst three quarters of 2011. Per capita income now stands at US$10,067. Public sector primary balance
averaged about 2.8 percent of GDP over 2004-10 and gross public debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 73.4
percent in 2002 to 45 percent in 2010, in spite of a moderate increase during the 2008-09 global crisis.
8.
The credibility built with consumers, investors, and ﬁnancial markets over several years allowed
the Government to adopt expansionary macroeconomic policies during the 2008-2009 global crisis. Turkey
suffered from a short but sharp fall in GDP (4.8 percent) in 2009. Imports and exports (which are concentrated
in pro-cyclical goods) both declined in 2009. Foreign direct investment slowed considerably from 2.3 percent
of GDP (US$17 billion) in 2008 to 1.1 percent of GDP in 2009 (US$6.9 billion). Unemployment reached a
high of 16.1 percent in February 2009, an increase of 4.2 percentage points compared with the same time in
2008. The authorities moved quickly to maintain conﬁdence and liquidity in the banking sector (including
through a reduction in reserve requirements and the reintroduction of a ‘blind-broker’ lending facility), and
implemented a set of employment measures, as well as ﬁscal stimuli. Between October 2008 and November
2009, the overnight interest rate was cut by a cumulative 10.25 percentage points. The general government
ﬁscal deﬁcit increased sharply from 1.6 percent in 2008 to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009, due mainly to the
operation of automatic stabilizers (such as the increase of approximately 1.8 percentage points of GDP in
budgetary transfer to the Social Security Institution (SSI)). Facilitated by expansionary policies, output is now
almost 10 percent higher than its pre-crisis peak, and the unemployment rate has fallen below 10 percent in
April 2011 for the ﬁrst time since mid-2008, notwithstanding an increase in labor force participation. However,
Turkey faces the challenge of managing the ﬁnancing of its high growth performance as well as increased
inﬂation rates.

As rapid growth resumed in 2010-2011, Turkey’s current account deﬁcit (CAD) rose from an eightyear low in 2009 to historic highs during 2011, ﬁnanced largely by short-term inﬂows. The CAD widened
from US$14 billion (2.3 percent of GDP) in 2009 to US$47.1 billion (6.4 percent of GDP) in 2010 and US$77.8
billion as of November 2011 (9.8 percent of GDP) on a 12-month rolling basis. Furthermore, the composition
of ﬁnancing of the CAD deteriorated with the share of FDI in total inﬂows falling from 45 percent in 2007 to
18 percent in 2011 (Figure 1). Although energy accounts for a large share of the trade deﬁcit (nearly 5 percent
of GDP on average in recent years), the non-energy balance contributed signiﬁcantly to the deterioration. The
private sector accounted for the bulk of the CAD, and private external indebtedness increased correspondingly,
from US$188 billion in 2008 to US$202.2 billion in 2011. The high level and short-term nature of the ﬁnancing
of the current account deﬁcit will likely continue in the near future, with the associated risks of a signiﬁcant
growth slowdown should Turkey be hit by growing risk aversion in global ﬁnancial markets.

High growth translated into continuing improvements in the headline ﬁscal balance, but primary
spending remains above pre-crisis levels. The general government ﬁscal deﬁcit declined from 5.5 percent
of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 1.2 percent in 2011 and, after a crisis-related increase in 2008, the public debt
to GDP ratio has resumed its downward trend. The decline in the ﬁscal deﬁcit reﬂects the strong cyclical
nature of tax revenues, but a comprehensive tax restructuring program and a reduction in the interest bill
have also contributed. However, primary spending remains signiﬁcantly above the pre-crisis level, primarily
due to higher capital investment, wage and pension spending. Adjusting for cyclical factors, the underlying
structural ﬁscal position has loosened, from a structural primary surplus equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP in
2007 to an estimated deﬁcit of around 1 percent of GDP in 2011.
11.
Facing difﬁcult policy trade-offs, CBRT (Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey) has implemented
an ‘unorthodox’ policy, moving to a tightening stance in late 2011. A weak global economy, the crisis in the
Euro-zone, and the transition from large capital inﬂows and upward pressure on the lira in 2010 to declining
inﬂows and lira depreciation pressures in 2011 have created difﬁcult economic policy trade-offs. In late 2010,
in response to surging capital inﬂows, CBRT adopted an ‘unorthodox’ monetary policy cutting overnight
interest rates in an effort to discourage portfolio investors from taking short-term ‘carry trade’ positions in lira
assets, while at the same time increasing reserve requirements to curtail domestic credit. The lira weakened
signiﬁcantly as a result, while credit growth began to slow following the introduction of macroprudential
measures by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority in June 2011. Prompted by concerns about the
global economy and early indicators of a domestic slowdown, CBRT reduced the policy rate by 50 bps in early
August. Since mid-October 2011, responding to an increase in inﬂation (primarily reﬂecting pass-through of
the cumulative 30 percent nominal depreciation since November 2010), CBRT has tightened monetary policy,
inter alia by increasing overnight lending rates and engaging in large-sale foreign exchange selling auctions
and direct interventions. As a result, the interbank overnight rate increased from 6.5 percent in December
2010 to 11.2 percent in December 2011, and the benchmark government bond yield rose from 7.11 to 11.04
percent during the same period.
12.
Turkey has moderate public safety net capacity and readiness in the event of a sudden increase
in needs. Social assistance spending is still low by international standards (1.2 percent of GDP in 2010) but
growing fast (a budget increase of 40 percent in 2012). Large programs, such as the Green Card and the
Conditional Cash Transfer Program, coexist with a multitude of small programs. These programs are now
better integrated thanks to the creation of a new ministry in charge of all social assistance beneﬁts and the
introduction of an Integrated Social Assistance Information System (ISAIS). The new system, along with efforts
to develop a single and improved proxy-means test for targeting all beneﬁts, will enhance the responsiveness
of the social assistance system to future crises by determining eligibility automatically and objectively through
a single proxy-means test.
Medium-term Economic Prospects
13.
Growth is expected to slow down signiﬁcantly in 2012, before recovering to about 5 percent annually
in the medium-term. On the back of slower credit growth and falling domestic and foreign demand, a slowdown in growth in the last quarter of 2011 is expected, following 9.6 percent GDP growth during the ﬁrst
three quarters of 2011. The annualized weekly credit growth rate declined to 23 percent in mid-December
2011, less than half its peak of 50 percent in January 2011. Annual GDP growth for 2011 is expected to be
around 8 percent and about 3 percent in 2012. The medium term macroeconomic outlook beyond 2012 is more
favorable and, in line with Government’s Medium-Term Program, projects a GDP growth rate of around 5
percent per annum, driven largely by strong private-sector led domestic demand. The projected growth is
predicated on capital inﬂows ﬁnancing a current account deﬁcit of 5-6 percent over the medium term.

6

14.
The growth path projected in the MTP is predicated on continued progress on Turkey’s unﬁnished
structural reform agenda. Such reforms include the implementation of the new commercial code and the
code of obligations, the labor market reform, measures to bolster long-term ﬁscal savings, and steps to reduce
the dependency on imports of fuel through an expansion of renewable energy use in electricity generation
and improvements in energy efﬁciency.

Despite the benign outlook in the baseline scenario, a combination of external and domestic factors
pose signiﬁcant risks going forward, including spillover from the European debt crisis. With low domestic
savings, Turkey’s economic growth relies on capital inﬂows to ﬁnance imports. The country’s large current
account deﬁcit and the composition of its ﬁnancing remain critical concerns. Under a deepened crisis scenario
in the Euro zone and a corresponding sudden stop of capital inﬂows to emerging markets driven by a ﬂight
to safety, Turkey could possibly face a renewed recession. See Annex 2 for the sustainability analysis.

III. VISION AND DEVELOPMENT
CHALLENGES
16.
The Government of Turkey has set itself ambitious development goals. Turkey intends to be one
of the world’s 10 largest economies by 2023 – the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic.
The Government’s 2023 ‘vision’6 aims for a gross domestic product of US$2 trillion; a foreign trade volume
in excess of US$1 trillion; per capita income to reach US$25,000; and, unemployment to decline to 5 percent.
Turkey also aims to complete full membership negotiations with the EU; further develop Istanbul as a leading
international ﬁnancial hub; and, become the leading manufacturing and service provider both in the region
and beyond 7.
17.
To achieve Turkey’s development goals and realize sustainable shared growth, the Government
is pursuing a wide range of economic policies and structural reforms, set out in its Ninth Development
Plan for 2007-2013,8 2012-2014 Medium-Term Program, and annual programs. Priorities include: (i) sound
macroeconomic and related structural ﬁscal policies to maintain stability and reduce short and medium term
vulnerabilities; (ii) investment climate, labor market, and skills reforms to increase competitiveness and create
jobs, especially for women and youth; (iii) fundamental education reforms and continuing health and social
welfare reform to increase productivity and help share the gains from growth through equal opportunities;
and, (iv) continuing energy and water sector reforms and investments to increase energy efﬁciency, the use of
renewable energy, improve energy security, help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigate and adapt
to climate change.
The Challenge of Enhancing Competitiveness and Employment
18.
For the last decade the Government’s rolling multi-year programs have been grounded in
macroeconomic policies and ﬁnancial reforms to support sustainable public and external debt positions.
During the 2001 banking crisis, GDP contracted by 5.7 percent and the country embarked on a concerted path
of structural reforms. These reforms included, inter alia, improving ﬁscal and public ﬁnancial management
and revamping the framework for macroeconomic management, within which an independent CBRT is
now responsible for inﬂation-targeting and the lira ﬂoats freely against other currencies. The effect of these
reforms has been pronounced. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) deﬁned public sector primary balance
averaged about 4.5 percent of GDP over 2004-07 and, after more expansionary policies in 2008-2009 during
the global crisis, the primary balance reverted to 1.6 percent in 2010. Gross public debt fell sharply from 73.4
percent of GDP in 2002 to 45 percent in 2010. Strengthening private and public sector balance sheets in the
aftermath of the 2001 crisis made Turkey resilient when the global economic and ﬁnancial crisis hit in 2008,
but growing external imbalances during the recovery have since eroded some of this resilience.
19.
The overarching macroeconomic goal of the Government’s medium-term program for 2012-14 is
to maintain robust growth and generate employment by improving competitiveness and increasing and
diversifying exports, thus helping to contain and reduce the current account deﬁcit. As Turkey’s openness
to trade – measured as the share of imports and exports in GDP – increased modestly over the last decade,
one target is to achieve exports of US$500 billion by 2023, up from US$114 billion in 2010. Meanwhile, the
composition of exports by sector underwent changes with a switch from textiles and garments to machinery

exports. Turkey’s trade with the EU-27 also changed as in particular Germany’s share of total exports fell
from 20.7 percent in 1997-99 to 10.5 percent in 2007-09. In 1997-99, the top ﬁve destinations for Turkey’s
exports (Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and France) accounted for 45.9 percent of
total exports but in 2005 the top ﬁve (Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, and Iraq) accounted for
only 40.4 percent of total exports.

20.
Creating more and better jobs for Turkey’s young and growing population is the most important
medium-term challenge. Although the labor market adjusted ﬂexibly after the international ﬁnancial crisis, it
remains characterized by low activity rates and low labor productivity, especially among women and youth.
Less than half of the working-age population (15-64 year olds) is employed, 20 percent below the OECD average,
and the employment rate of women is especially low (26.5 percent). About 31.1 percent of youth (15-24 year
olds), mostly women, are neither working nor attending school—the highest share of inactive youth among
OECD countries. Job informality (deﬁned as jobs without social security beneﬁts) has fallen remarkably, but
still affects 43.3 percent of workers (29.1 percent excluding the agricultural sector), contributing to Turkey’s
lower labor productivity compared with OECD and other peer countries. Urbanization, agricultural labor
shedding and a still rapidly growing working-age population (until 2020) will continue to put pressure on
the labor market.
21.
The Government’s prioritization of the labor market and jobs agenda will allow Turkey to use its
gradually closing demographic window and lay the basis for the creation of more and more productive
jobs as early as possible. The Government introduced an action plan to reduce informality in 2008. The
2008 labor reform reduced non-wage labor costs and opened Active Labor Market Programs (ALMP) to all
registered unemployed. Subsequently, the Government expanded the coverage and increased the relevance
of ALMPs, with a focus on vocational training. The 2011 Omnibus Law reduced disincentives to part-time
work and extended the program of subsidies to new employees (particularly women and youth).
22.
The Government is preparing a new National Employment Strategy, which will include a focus on
making labor markets more ﬂexible while increasing the protection of workers. Policies and reforms under
discussion include: more ﬂexible contracting, including reduced restrictions or disincentives for part-time,
ﬁxed-term and temporary work; the introduction of pre-funded severance accounts and an increased coverage

9

of unemployment insurance; and an enhanced enforcement of labor laws and awareness-raising to reduce
informality. Also under consideration are efforts to further scale up employment activation programs and
services, particularly among low skilled youth and women, in a cost-effective way through better targeting
and proﬁling (so that the package of services is adapted to the needs of the jobless) and linking the receipt of
social beneﬁts to activation. The new National Employment Strategy will complement ongoing and planned
reforms to improve secondary education curricula to build job-relevant skills, increase program choice and
ﬂexibility in secondary education, and raise quality assurance in higher education.
23.
Building skills for work, entrepreneurship, and innovation will enhance productive employment.
Half of the working-age population has less than basic education and this group accounts for 64 percent of
the jobless and 65 percent of informal workers. Younger workers are better educated and skilled, but still lag
behind their counterparts in OECD countries. Turkish ﬁrms cite skills as the third most important constraint
to business operations after credit availability and corruption. The Government is focusing on challenges
like building a strong foundation through early childhood education, getting basic skills right through basic
education, and building job-relevant skills through high quality secondary and higher education, as well as
upgrading skills and reducing employment barriers particularly for low skilled youth and women.
24.
Continuing efforts to improve the business regulatory regime will also be important in enhancing
private sector competitiveness. Turkey has made strides to improve business regulation, partly through
closer consultation with the private sector. This has been most notably done through the Committee for
the Improvement of the Investment Climate (YOIKK) platform. However, challenges remain with red tape
continuing to impose a signiﬁcant cost on businesses.9 The lead agency in regulatory reform, the Prime
Ministry, is addressing these challenges in the preparation of a national strategy for regulatory reform. This
is expected to focus on improving intra-government coordination, better documentation of the many relevant
laws and secondary regulations, and on a pilot project for administrative simpliﬁcation.10
25.
Turkey has made progress in promoting more competitive domestic markets, and the authorities
have identiﬁed and set out to address remaining challenges, particularly in the area of state-owned
enterprises. Turkey has strengthened the application of antitrust and merger control policies, achieving a
high level of alignment with the EU. Since the early 2000s a signiﬁcant privatization program was launched
reducing the share of SOEs net sales to 23 percent (2009) of the largest 500 ﬁrms. The share will go down further
as the energy privatization progresses. However, it remains a reform agenda as government ownership is still
prevalent in Turkey in some areas of the economy.11 Moreover, these companies receive state support and
often regulatory functions are not clearly separated. This risks distorting the market and creating a non-level
playing ﬁeld for potential private entrants and investors.
26.
The Government recognizes the importance of innovation to increase long term growth. Innovation
can serve as a ‘silent engine of prosperity,’ spurring sustained wealth and growth. It can lead to the expansion
of an internationally competitive SME sector to complement Turkey’s globally integrated large corporations.
Public and especially private sector R&D spending can help boost the productivity of existing ﬁrms and
stimulate the creation of new innovative businesses. While Turkey still has ample scope to grow by adopting
frontier technologies from abroad, it shares with many European countries the challenge of promoting
product and process innovation among its SMEs, which account for 27 percent of total output and 80 percent
of employment.

According to the World Bank’s 2008-2009 Enterprise Survey, the share of senior management‘s time spent dealing with requirements imposed
by government regulations averaged 27 percent in Turkey compared to an average for Europe and Central Asia Region of 15 percent.

27.
Deeper and broader ﬁnancial markets will promote investment and competitiveness. Turkey’s
ﬁnancial system has deepened since the 2001 crisis, with ﬁnancial system assets amounting to 105 percent of
GDP in 2010. However, despite a relatively large number and variety of non-bank ﬁnancial institutions, the
market share of the banking sector, already relatively high, has increased. Moreover, despite recent gains,
the maturity proﬁle of both assets and liabilities remain short term in nature, with the average maturity of
deposits oscillating at around 45 days, and just about half of loans bearing a remaining maturity of one year or
less as of end-June 2011. Turkey is still relatively under banked, with a credit to GDP ratio of about 50 percent.
28.
Turkey’s ﬁnancial services coverage is particularly low in rural areas and among female-owned
enterprises. Expanding access to ﬁnance is critical for both farmers and agro-processing companies–
especially in the SME segment–to upgrade productive assets, compete with EU counterparts and move
towards compliance with European Union food safety standards. In Turkey, women-owned businesses
represent almost 40 percent of registered SMEs, of which only 15 percent have access to ﬁnance. The banking
environment does not encourage women to receive bank ﬁnancing.
29.
Productivity and competitiveness have been rising in agriculture and rural areas, but more slowly
than in other sectors and urban areas—and government policies and programs aim to address the challenges
of rural competitiveness; rural area job creation; and, rural-urban migration. Although Turkey is a leader
in the production of a number of crops with export potential, limited technical and human capacity and
non-compliance with EU food standards (the largest potential market for Turkey’s agro exports) constrain
the development of Turkey’s agri-business sector. Agricultural polices aim to bring agriculture in line with
EU standards, with a particular emphasis on agri-business modernization. The Government aims to develop
policies toward measures that support private investments in rural areas, including the agri-food sector, as
well as in R&D and human resources to create rural opportunities and help boost efﬁciency, competitiveness
and improve market access. The Government is in the process of strengthening water management to address
energy, agricultural, environmental, and climate challenges. Possible government interventions may include
programs for modernizing agri-food processing; an innovative rationalization of land consolidation; and,
integrated approaches to water basin management and strategic regional development.
The Challenge of Improving Equity and Public Services
30.
While average social outcomes have improved, large inequalities persist, starting at a very early
age and reinforced in school. Turkey’s Human Development Index (HDI) has increased from 0.671 in 2005
to 0.699 in 2011, putting Turkey in the high human development group, although its index remains below the
OECD average. However, Turkey’s inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)—which adjusts
for inequalities in health, education and income measures—is 23 percent lower than its nominal HDI. A large
share of this inequality is explained by factors outside of individuals’ control: one third of wealth inequality is
explained by factors like birth place and parental education. Inequality of opportunities transcends generations
and thus appears from a very early age, limiting the ability of poor children to succeed in life: 29 percent of
0-5 year olds in the low opportunity group suffer from stunting (very low height for age, an indicator of
malnutrition), compared to only 3 percent of the high opportunity group.12 Similar differences can be seen in
child care and preschool use. These differences are reinforced by the school system, leading to differences in
educational achievement and learning outcomes.

12

The low opportunity group includes children who live in rural areas, with parental educational attainment of primary school or less and
households where the mother tongue is not Turkish. The high opportunity group includes children who live in urban areas; where the
mother has at least secondary and the father at least tertiary education, and where the mother tongue spoken at home is Turkish. For further
information, see Turkey: Equality of Opportunities and Early Childhood Development (World Bank, Report No. 48627-TR, February 2010).

11

31.
The Government plans to expand early childhood education (ECE) to help correct inequalities at
an early stage by providing a strong foundation for all children. Adding one year of pre-school education
in Turkey could increase family incomes by 8 percent, reduce the number of poor families by 11 percent, and
increase female labor force participation by 9 percent. A plan is underway to achieve universal enrollment
of ﬁve-year olds by 2014.13 Building on this plan, the further expansion and improvement of ECE could be
supported by increased public funding; targeted resources for disadvantaged children and lagging provinces;
a quality assurance system, including education standards and a mechanism for monitoring and enforcing
them; and, reaching out to groups including the private sector and NGOs to complement government efforts.
32.
The Government aims to improve teacher quality and education service delivery in low performing
schools to help promote equal opportunities and provide all children with basic skills. The average 15 year
old in Turkey is still about one full school year behind the average OECD student. However, performance
varies across schools and regions: while students in Science and Anatolian high schools perform at OECD
levels, other schools (accounting for 75 percent of students) perform below. These inequalities are partly rooted
in the secondary education entrance exam and the system of private tutoring centers that it has generated—a
system that the Government is reviewing and targeting to eliminate its demand. Efforts are under way to
expand and improve in-service teacher training. Other key challenges and opportunities for improving the
education service delivery system and learning outcomes lie in developing a more objective and transparent
education ﬁnancing system that allocates funding according to costs, providing additional resources to
disadvantaged schools, and increasing school ﬁnancial autonomy and accountability at all levels.14
33.
Gender equality has improved in education and health, but large inequalities remain in the access
to economic opportunities. There are virtually no differences in vaccinations and stunting between 0-5 year
old boys and girls. Maternal mortality has been sharply reduced. Virtually all girls and boys attend primary
schools and, in 2011, girls’ secondary enrollment rate of 66 percent lagged 6 percent behind the 72 percent
for boys. However, only about one quarter of women work (as opposed to 67 percent of men), 60 percent
of women work in the informal sector (37 percent of men), and only 9 percent of ﬁrms have a female senior
manager. Even among youth, 48.1 percent of women neither work nor attend school or training (21.6 percent
of men). Improving women’s access to more and better jobs as well as opportunities for entrepreneurship will
increase total productive employment in Turkey. Indeed, a 6 percentage point increase in the proportion of
working women might increase income by 7 percent and reduce poverty by 15 percent.
34.
Turkey’s Health Transformation Program has produced gains in the access to and quality of
health services since 2003, leading to cumulative improvements in aggregate health outcomes.15 The
family medicine model is already operational nationwide and Universal Health Insurance covers most of the
population16. Both internal factors (increased social security and health service coverage) and external factors
(rising demand for new and expensive technologies, population ageing and the rising incidence of noncommunicable diseases) will drive up health care costs in the coming years. Global expenditure caps have
helped to contain health spending in the short term, but addressing the underlying drivers of health spending
could further strengthen the long term sustainability of the health system. To sustain high performance, the
Government is pursuing further reforms to increase the efﬁciency of health spending, including: a review of
the basic beneﬁts package, improvements to the current provider payment and cost containment mechanisms
(through measures such as the expansion of diagnosis-related group payments for hospital inpatient and
outpatient services to all hospitals), strengthened pharmaceutical policies, hospital autonomy, and the
introduction of incentives for family medicine providers to act as gatekeepers to the system, particularly in
strategic areas like Non-Communicable Diseases.

Turkey: Equality of Opportunities and Early Childhood Development (World Bank, Report No. 48627-TR, February 2010).
School report cards may be one tool for increasing school accountability.
For example, maternal mortality fell from 29 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 16.4 deaths in 2010. Infant mortality also decreased,
dropping from 25 to 10.1 per 1,000 live births in the same period.
16 Starting from January 2012, the cost of health services provided to citizens covered by non-contributory health insurance (formerly known as
the Green Card Program) will be part of SSI’s balance and ﬁnanced through the overall government transfers to the SSI.

12

35.
Turkey’s 2008 social security reform improved the coverage of public pensions and is expected
to yield signiﬁcant savings - but these are insufﬁcient to ensure pension system balance over the long
term. Pension spending in Turkey is still modest in comparison to high income OECD countries at around
7 percent of GDP, reﬂecting a relatively young population. However, more than half of pension spending is
ﬁnanced through budget transfers. This is due to the high system dependency ratio (fewer than two people
contributing per beneﬁciary), unusual for a country with a young and growing population, resulting from
generous eligibility for public pensions (early retirement, low minimum years of service). The 2008 reform
adjusted pension parameters, gradually increasing the retirement age and contribution period and reducing
the accrual rate. But the adjustments are phased in over a period of several decades, too slow to counter
the effects of rising coverage and a maturing population on pension system deﬁcits which are expected to
remain around 3 percent of GDP until the middle of the century. To improve the long term sustainability of
pensions, additional parametric adjustments of public pensions, increased formal labor force participation,
and expanded private pensions would be necessary. Current efforts to reduce social security deﬁcits are
focused on reducing informality through better monitoring; enforcement and awareness; and, containing
health spending.
36.
The Government is taking steps to develop an integrated social assistance system and expand
targeted social assistance to help welfare recipients out of poverty. Social assistance spending increased
rapidly in recent years, but remains low by international standards (1.2 percent of GDP). Coordination across
social assistance programs has been limited in the past. After the June 2011 election, the Government combined
responsibility for all central government social assistance beneﬁts under the new Ministry of Family and
Social Policies. The Government is implementing a new Integrated Social Assistance Information System,
with a single proxy-means test to target beneﬁts more effectively. All beneﬁciaries of social assistance who are
able to work are required to register with ISKUR.
37.
Building on the achievements in reforming the public ﬁnancial management system, both in
sectors (like health and social assistance) and the central government at large, Turkey is now focusing on
implementation issues and an extension of the reforms to the rest of the public sector. At the central level,
the Government is planning to amend the Public Financial Management and Control Law, drawing on ﬁve
years of experience with the systems the law established. Strengthening the link between plans, programs and
budgets will be one priority for the Government—for example by moving towards a program based budget
classiﬁcation that is compatible with the existing budget code. Other areas include the full implementation of
the new external and internal audit framework, the complete integration of the internal audit function, and
improvements in the commitment monitoring system. In addition, the Government plans to broaden and
deepen reforms in the public ﬁnancial management and accountability framework for local administrations,
where progress has been lagging to date, in part due to the weak capacity of many local administrations. The
Government also plans to prepare a new governance framework for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with a
view to improving the transparency, accountability and efﬁciency of SOEs while promoting private sector
entry and investment in markets where SOEs participate.
38.
The Government is planning to advance Turkey’s decentralization agenda, with a focus on
improving public service delivery while maintaining ﬁscal discipline. In its 2012 Annual Program, the
Government announced its intention to prepare new legislation on local administrations’ own revenues. This
will complement the previous efforts to reform intergovernmental ﬁscal relations.

Box 1: Implementing Governance to Underpin Economic Growth
Overall, Turkey is ahead of other upper middle income countries, as well as of countries in the Europe and
Central Asia region, in many governance indicators. Signiﬁcant strides have been made in introducing an
appropriate legal framework to address governance challenges. However, implementation issues exist, as well
as more generally access and use of information by civil society1. This box provides a summary of governance
challenges in the public and private sector, focusing on areas where the authorities and the World Bank have
partnered in the past and intend to continue work during this partnership strategy:
Governance and the Public Sector:
• Public Financial Management Performance: A 2010 benchmarking study highlights areas for improvements in
downstream budget management, including internal control and audit systems and commitment monitoring.
It also indicates that the modernization of external audit has not kept pace with progress in other parts of the
public ﬁnancial management system. The new Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA) Law, enacted in 2010, expands
the mandate of the TCA to cover the entire public sector, introducing ﬁnancial and performance audits in line
with international standards and providing the legislative basis for improved control.
• Legal Framework against Corruption: A national Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan were adopted in 2010,
with a focus on preventative and awareness-increasing measures. The adoption of speciﬁc provisions in the
Criminal Code, and legislation on public procurement, public ﬁnancial management, right to information,
and asset declaration strengthened the legal framework. Enforcement efforts have been enhanced through
the establishment of agencies such as the Public Procurement Agency, the Ethics Board, the internal Audit
Coordination Board and a more autonomous Revenue Administration Ofﬁce. More streamlined procedures
for tax administration; customs; and business licensing have increased efﬁciency and reduced opportunities
for corruption. Judicial Reform and ‘Fight against Informality’ Strategies have been prepared, and action plans
are in place to follow through on implementation.
Governance and the Private Sector:
• Licensing Procedures: Turkey lags behind comparator economies in offering efﬁcient and transparent licensing
procedures. OECD indicators of product market regulation show that administrative procedures in Turkey
remain opaque and continue to impose high entry barriers on new market players. Compared to EU countries,
for example, start-ups in Turkey have to undergo more mandatory steps, need to interact with more public
and private bodies, spend more time and money to complete registration requirements, with no single contact
points (‘one stop shops’) for obtaining information and for issuing licenses. Moreover, according to the World
Bank’s 2008-2009 Enterprise Survey, the share of senior management’s time spent dealing with requirements
imposed by government regulations averaged 27 percent in Turkey, compared to an average for the Europe
and Central Asia region of 15 percent.
• Corporate Governance and Contract Enforcement: The implementation of a New Commercial Code (to become
effective in June 2012), together with additional steps to reduce red tape, will play a signiﬁcant role in improving
corporate governance in Turkey. The main approach of the new Code is to introduce more transparent
corporate governance principles, with the aim of fostering trust in the ﬁnancial positions of Turkish companies
and thus increasing their global competitive strength. The four main pillars of the code are: Transparency,
Accountability, Regulatory Innovation and Fairness. It is expected that Turkey would improve its score in the
‘protecting investors’ indicators in the World Bank’s Doing Business ratings following this reform.

A detailed report on governance in Turkey has recently been prepared by Global Integrity. Comparative data can also be found in annual
reports by Transparency International, the Bertelsmann Transformation Index and the World Bank Institute Governance indicators. The
Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey provide information on governance issues seen from the perspective of the private
sector. This box draws on these and other public sources.

The Challenge of Deepening Sustainable Development
39.
Building on fundamental energy sector reform, which accelerated over the last decade, Turkey is
moving to develop an increasingly reliable and efﬁcient energy supply, while seeking to mitigate climate
change. After a temporary slowdown during the global crisis, energy demand is growing rapidly, particularly
electricity demand (which grew by 7 percent in 2010), mirroring the rebound in economic growth. Turkey has
added signiﬁcant new generation capacity - 11,400 MW between 2008-11. Future demand growth however,
is projected to be around 6.5-7.5 percent per annum, and forecasts suggest that in the absence of continued
large-scale investments in generation and under average hydrological conditions, Turkey could begin to see
supply shortages by 2015/16. Challenges include:
i. Import dependency: Energy imports (mostly oil and gas) account for over 20 percent of Turkey’s imports
and about 50 percent of the current account deﬁcit. Natural gas now accounts for almost half of total
electricity generation, and has the largest share of primary energy supply (at 31 percent, followed by oil
at 28 percent). Turkey’s dependence on imported gas could therefore increase energy security risks - in
terms of both volume and price. Growing diversiﬁcation of energy supply, particularly through renewable
resources, could help reduce this import dependence over time.
ii. Legal and regulatory framework strengthening for more hydro energy: Turkey’s target is to utilize its estimated
140 TWh of economic hydro potential, of which about 40 percent has been exploited. Further development
requires addressing potential cumulative environmental effects and dam safety issues.
iii. Transmission network investments for more wind energy: Turkey’s target is to reach a wind generation capacity
of 20,000 MW by 2023 from just above 1,300 MW in 2010. Wind generation is decentralized, has a short
construction period and produces electricity intermittently with substantial variations. The challenge for
the transmission system is therefore the large-scale implementation of the still largely untested licensing
and grid connection mechanisms like SmartGrid applications.
iv. Climate change mitigation through energy efﬁciency: Turkey’s economy is relatively energy intensive –
requiring 0.26 ton of oil equivalent (toe) for every US$1,000 of GDP, compared with the OECD average of
0.18 in 2008. A recent World Bank study17 estimated that in industry and buildings alone, the total energy
saving potential is about 27 percent or 15.1 million tons; about 20 percent of annual energy imports. The
systematic pursuit of energy efﬁciency is therefore a priority and critical for Turkey’s energy security,
macro/ﬁscal stability, competitiveness, climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability.
The Government has taken many of the required legal, regulatory/pricing and institutional measures to
promote energy efﬁciency and is supporting the ﬁnancing of investments through specialized targeted
credit lines.
40.
The sustainable management of natural resources and nature protection are growing in importance
as long-term challenges for Turkey, along with climate change adaptation. Turkey’s natural resources face
increasing pressures from growth in energy use, industry, transport, tourism, and agriculture resulting in
water stress, soil erosion and pollution. At the same time, Turkey is also one of the most vulnerable countries
in Europe and Central Asia to climate variability and change because of its location and the condition and
sensitivity of its natural resource base. Issues include: water stress—with Turkey already being considered a
‘water-stressed’ country by international standards;18 and severe land degradation—with more than 59 percent
of Turkey’s land area suffering from severe erosion, and forest cover now at 26 percent, down from 70 percent
originally. Turkey is already addressing a range of regulatory and institutional reforms in the environment and
forestry sectors and prioritizing investment programs in infrastructure, pollution mitigation, and afforestation.
Measures to address these challenges are now becoming a priority for the Government. Negotiations on the
EU Chapter on Environment were opened in December 2009.

Tapping the Potential Energy Savings in Turkey (World Bank, Report No. 52210-TR, January 2011).
Turkey’s renewable water resources are estimated around 1,500 m3 per capita per year, expected to further drop in the future as a result of
climate change and resource exploitation.

15

41.
Cities are at the forefront of Turkey’s sustainable development agenda. The pace of urbanization in
Turkey has transformed what was a predominantly agrarian economy in the 1950s with only 4 million Turks
living in cities (25 percent of the total population) into a globally competitive industrialized economy with
over 70 percent of its population in cities. While cities enabled this economic transformation, bringing human
capital, innovation and know-how to urban centres, they have also brought new sustainability challenges.
For instance, motorization rates have increased more than ten-fold over the past 30 years (15 vehicles per
1,000 persons to 190 vehicles per 1,000 persons), adding congestion costs to growing metropolitan areas.
Housing shortages have driven up rents, causing informal settlement expansion in precarious locations with
inadequate services and sub-standard housing vulnerable to seismic risks. Longer planning horizons will
be important for improvements in the sustainability of Turkish cities–as will improved land-use planning
and a shift to life-cycle costing of investments, which may entail higher upfront capital outlays but reap
better economic returns over the long term. The Government’s newly issued National Integrated Urban
Development Strategy (KENTGES 2011) reﬂects these progressive urban planning principles.
42.
Turkey is vulnerable to natural disasters, particularly earthquakes. Within the nation’s high-risk
context, Istanbul is most vulnerable due to its seismic-prone location on the North Anatolian Fault, and its
high population and commercial/industrial densities. The Government has made progress in strengthening
the national emergency management system, and the local system in Istanbul. In addition, a large program of
seismic retroﬁtting of public buildings in Istanbul is an internationally respected showcase. However, much
remains to be done to replicate the experience of Istanbul in other high-risk areas in Turkey, and to expand
the current mitigation actions to include private and commercial buildings. Disaster mitigation, including
preparation for long-term effects such as climate change, remains a focus of Turkey’s urban development
agenda.

IV. TURKEY-WORLD BANK
GROUP PARTNERSHIP
Previous Country Partnership Strategy
43.
During the FY08-11 CPS, Turkey achieved substantial development results, while weathering
the impact of the global economic crisis, with the World Bank Group playing a catalytic role. Sound
government policies were at the heart of Turkey’s strong overall economic performance. Policies, programs,
and projects realized in partnership with the WBG produced concrete development results. For example,
electricity transmission and peak capacity increased by 60 percent between 2002 and 2010. The health system’s
greater reach and efﬁciency improved health outcomes throughout the country, and has gained international
recognition. The progress made by Istanbul’s Governorship in strengthening the city’s resilience against
earthquakes, and disaster response preparedness, is considered an international model. Most CPS milestones
were achieved or partially achieved (see CPS Completion Report, Annex 3).
44.
Over the course of the previous CPS, Turkey’s partnership with IBRD, IFC and MIGA, while
strategically focused, grew in size, importance, and strength—with a timely scale-up of WBG ﬁnancial and
knowledge services during the global crisis:
a) Increased ﬁnancing: Turkey became IBRD’s second largest client, with US$12.9 billion in outstanding
commitments at the end of FY11. Total new IBRD ﬁnancing commitments in the CPS were US$7.6 billion,
an increase of US$1.4 billion from the originally envisaged US$6.2 billion, reﬂecting increased ﬁnancial
support to help address the impact of the global ﬁnancial crisis. IFC delivered US$2 billion in ﬁnancing
in 45 projects: 41 percent in the infrastructure sector; 38 percent in the ﬁnancial sector; and 21 percent in
manufacturing, agribusiness and the health and education sectors. Turkey is now MIGA’s second largest
client, with a growth in gross exposure from US$671.8 million at the end of FY08 to US$951 million at
end-FY11.
b) Extensive demand-driven knowledge and technical assistance: IBRD’s large program of analytic and
advisory (AAA) services focused on supporting Turkey’s policy and reform priorities. It featured 52
knowledge products, many of which were prepared jointly with Government and in collaboration with
other development partners. Topics included, inter alia, work on public ﬁnancial management; informality
and savings; energy sector reform and regulation; food safety, and watershed management, education
quality, female employment and gender certiﬁcation, and the (in)equality of opportunities, the investment
climate, competition and business regulation, and corporate bond market development.
45.
The CPS’ ﬂexible framework enabled the World Bank Group to support Turkey in attaining results
beyond the strategy’s original scope. The WBG was able to respond to Turkey’s request for additional
support, and to adapt the composition and sequencing of analytical work and ﬁnancing to help address
urgent new challenges, while keeping a focus on longer-term development priorities. The CPS also permitted
Turkey and the WBG to launch a new collaboration on climate change and environmental management.
The initial strategy had not elaborated program activities in the areas of climate change and environment,
but recognized and allowed for the possibility of developing collaboration later. Such collaboration indeed
developed later, including through both analytic work and ﬁnancing, and is expected to grow in the new CPS.

18

46.
Leveraging the capabilities of the entire World Bank Group in strategic sectors strengthened the
partnership. Work on private sector development is a good example. IBRD was able to focus on medium
and long term policy issues, for example through investment climate assessments (ICAs) and the preparation
of a roadmap for the development of the Turkish corporate bond market. IFC focused on infrastructure
projects, mobilizing US$1.6 billion through private ﬁnancial institutions, and helped to strengthen ﬁrms’
competitiveness and international expansion including to the Balkans, Russia, Georgia, Tunisia, and Egypt.
Both IBRD and IFC scaled up ﬁnancing for SMEs and exporters during the global crisis when such ﬁnancing
was urgently needed—serving a broadly complementary customer base. MIGA also supported the private
sector, and assisted Turkish companies looking to expand abroad – there were ﬁve active projects guaranteeing
these sorts of investments at the close of the last CPS.
Lessons from the FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report
47.
Lesson 1: The systematic development and maintenance of a policy dialogue in support of long-term
strategic goals, combining knowledge and lending operations, are vital to support reforms. Major policy
and legislative reforms can take time to implement; therefore ﬂexibility and patience are critical for ensuring
good results. Collaboration on the Commercial Code (seven years in preparation) provides an example of the
value of long-term engagement from the previous CPS. To increase success, the full integration of combined
analytical work and policy ﬁnancing into national development plans and medium-term programs is critical.
The programmatic structuring of work, in the form of modular interventions which build on each other
sequentially, is particularly effective.
48.
Lesson 2: The new engagement on environment and climate change, which started during the
previous CPS, illustrates the importance and value of carefully identifying strategic entry points and
seizing opportunities as country priorities evolve. Turkey and the WBG agreed not to use the environment
as a pillar in the CPS FY08-11, reﬂecting limited advancement of the environmental agenda during 20042007 and a decision to consider a possible re-engagement, at Turkey’s initiative, during the 2008-2011 CPS
period. Turkey’s accession to the Kyoto protocol and the opening of the Environmental Chapter of the EU
Acquis in 2009 provided the opportunity and strategic entry point for a new engagement on this topic. This
opportunity grew out of the Turkey-WBG partnership on energy. The electricity DPL series was broadened
into the Environmental Sustainability and Energy Security (ESES) DPL series, with three components: energy,
climate change, and environmental sustainability. This work led to collaboration in preparation for the 2012
UN Sustainable Development Conference (Rio+20). IFC used its support for Turkey’s liberalization program
to secure low carbon solutions to meet growing electricity demand.
49.
Lesson 3: A strengthened focus on monitoring and evaluation (M&E), welcomed by the Turkish
authorities, became a vehicle for further developing the Turkey-World Bank Group partnership. Turkey
and the World Bank established a rolling programmatic Joint Portfolio Progress Report (JPPR) to collaborate
in strengthening monitoring and evaluation and the results focus of government and WBG-supported
programs. The World Bank also provided technical assistance on M&E ﬁnanced by the IDF, and Turkey and
the World Bank were partners in many task-speciﬁc M&E activities during the CPS period, including special
efforts to include results frameworks in all AAA activities, with the intention of strengthening the World
Bank’s own approach to M&E.
50.
Lesson 4: In a number of ﬁelds Turkey’s policies and reforms, conducted in partnership with
the World Bank Group, have gained international recognition. Examples include health, energy market
development, and disaster risk management. This experience provides a basis for further such Turkey-WBG
collaboration in this CPS. Turkey and the WBG plan to expand their partnership by working together on
enabling knowledge sharing and contributing to development with other countries both in the region and
globally.

19

51.
The World Bank Group will continue to be most effective in its partnership with Turkey by
leveraging its three arms: IBRD, IFC and MIGA. Turkey and the WBG expect to continue the approach to
private sector support in the previous CPS—where all parts of the WBG provide complementary ﬁnancing
and services to Turkish clients.
Stakeholder Consultations and Client Country Survey
52.
The 2011 Client Country Survey, conducted in preparation for the new CPS, presented a broad
range of opinions on the World Bank Group’s work in Turkey. Development priorities for TurkeyWBG partnership identiﬁed by respondents were education with an emphasis on skills; environment and
natural resource management; employment; energy; and disaster preparedness19. These choices are broadly
consistent with the priorities identiﬁed in this CPS and the analysis presented in the CPS Completion Report.
Development priorities were as follows: rural development, increased job opportunities in the formal sector,
enhancing opportunities for private sector growth and investment, access to pre-school education, and
economic growth. With the exception of rural development, these sector priorities largely mirrored work
carried out in the previous CPS. Less positively, respondents noted the slowness and complexity of processes
as the WBG’s greatest weakness in Turkey, and identiﬁed interaction with stakeholders outside government
as an area for improvement. Respondents also perceived WBG work as not being particularly effective in
reducing poverty in Turkey.
53.
The World Bank Group undertook a number of formal consultations and workshops with
counterparts and civil society while preparing this CPS. Events were held in Ankara, Erzurum and Istanbul,
in addition to the WBG’s regular process of consulting with both government counterparts and Turkish civil
society. Overall, the feedback from all parties was encouraging and provided both a realistic vision of the
efﬁcacy of the WBG’s work in Turkey to date, and provided valuable input on future directions the partnership
might take–both in the new CPS and beyond. In this CPS, to further strengthen its partnership with Turkey
and ensure that work carried out becomes increasingly responsive to client demand, the WBG will continue
to work with, and listen closely to, civil society and our broader range of counterparts in Turkey.

19

The survey had a 32 percent response rate.

V. RESULTS AREAS
Strategic Objectives of Country Partnership Strategy FY12-15
54.
The objective of this partnership strategy is to contribute to Turkey’s goal of fast, sustainable,
and inclusive growth that respects the environment. Turkey has a set of clear strategic development
frameworks that guide the implementation of its reform agenda. The most important medium to longer-term
programs are the Ninth Development Plan 2007- 201320, the Medium-Term Program, and the Pre-Accession
Economic Program 2011-13; these are complemented by the Government’s Annual Programs. The CPS
design reﬂects the priorities established in these programs and is ﬂexible to respond to changes. The main
criterion for WBG support in Turkey is its ‘strategic value-added’, through the combination of ﬁnancing
support, analysis and advice, and implementation support to help address particularly complex development
challenges, and relevant international experience to provide benchmarks and help inform the development
and implementation of policies and programs.
55.
The CPS has three main strategic objectives: enhanced competitiveness and employment, improved
equity and public services, and deepened sustainable development. In pursuit of these objectives, the
Turkish government, private sector, civil society and the WBG plan to work together toward the following 10
outcomes during the four-year CPS period:

56.
A ﬂexible CPS design. The results framework for the CPS deﬁnes the development outcomes of the
WBG partnership with Turkey for the entire four-year CPS period. These CPS outcomes are contributions
to concrete government targets. A number of speciﬁc milestones will serve to monitor progress toward
achievement of the CPS outcomes. These milestones mostly reﬂect the envisaged partnership through
analytic and advisory services and DPL ﬁnancing and, as much as possible, quantitative targets drawing
on the planned implementation of WBG ﬁnanced investments in some areas. The coverage of milestones
is focused on FY12-13. The CPS Progress Report will deﬁne milestones for FY14-15, allowing for mid-term
adaptation to respond to evolving priorities. This pragmatic approach is expected to facilitate the formulation
of realistic and veriﬁable milestones that enjoy the ownership of implementing agencies.
57.
A sizable program of analytical and advisory activities (AAA) will continue to be a central feature
of the Turkey-World Bank partnership. Knowledge services and technical assistance add value through
the provision of high quality analysis, global experience, and practical hands-on implementation support.
Reﬂecting the high value that the Government places on AAA, the share of AAA spending in IBRD’s total
work program budget for Turkey has steadily increased over the last four years. In the next CPS, Turkey and
the World Bank expect to identify and explore modalities, including cost sharing options, for continuing a
large and strong AAA program.
58.
The World Bank Group ﬁnancing program. Responding to the Government’s request for continued
high levels of IBRD ﬁnancing, the CPS FY12-15 envisages an IBRD ﬁnancing program in the order of up to
US$4.45 billion. The indicative ﬁnancing program is set out in Table 3. Overall amounts will depend, inter
alia, on government demand and performance, country and global economic and ﬁnancial developments, and
IBRD’s ﬁnancing capacity and demand by other borrowers throughout the CPS period. The IBRD ﬁnancing
program for FY14-15 will be ﬁnalized at the time of the CPS Progress Report. IFC own-account investment
program in Turkey is expected to remain in the range of US$425-500 million a year or, US$1.7-2.0 billion for
the CPS period. IFC expects to invest US$200-230 million a year in the ﬁnancial sector, US$130-150 million a
year in infrastructure, and US$90-120 million a year in the manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors.
IFC’s advisory services will continue to focus on sustainable energy and gender ﬁnance.
Strategic Objective 1: Enhanced Competitiveness and Employment
World Bank Group contributing to:
Outcome 1: Sustained macroeconomic and ﬁnancial stability and strengthened exports, domestic savings,
and external resilience
Outcome 2: Increased employment and reduced job informality, especially for women and youth
Outcome 3: Improved investment and business climate; deepened and broadened access to ﬁnance
59.
Outcome 1: Sustained macroeconomic and ﬁnancial stability and strengthened exports, domestic
savings, and external resilience. The Government’s medium-term program projects robust growth for the
next four years, grounded in continued strong economic policies and reforms. However, new vulnerabilities
have emerged as a byproduct of strong growth. These are unlikely to abate in the near term, and careful
management will be important to avoid the boom-bust cycles of the past. Implementing ongoing and planned
reforms to bolster productivity, employment and to secure long-term ﬁscal savings will be critical. These
include: implementing the new commercial code and code of obligations; planned second-stage labor market
reforms; including severance pay reform and greater employment ﬂexibility; improvements to the business
environment; and further privatization that will help gradually improve corporate sector productivity and
proﬁtability.

23

60.
Outcome 2: Increased employment and reduced job informality, especially for women and youth.
The World Bank plans to continue supporting the Government’s labor market reform and job creation
agenda, including in particular the implementation of the new, comprehensive National Employment
Strategy—with its expected focus on increased labor market ﬂexibility and worker protection, the market
relevance of skills and education, the employability of vulnerable groups such as youth and women, and
reduced informality. The WBG intends to support government efforts to enhance productive employment,
particularly the activation of low skilled youth and women into formal employment through the expansion
of well-designed employment activation programs, with a focus on skills upgrading. The program for the
planned new programmatic DPL series around growth, competitiveness, and employment is expected to
include policy actions to increase labor market ﬂexibility, worker protection, and reduction of job informality.
AAA is expected to support the development and implementation of the National Employment Strategy;
education and training initiatives through studies (e.g., ESW on Labor, ESW on Programmatic Education);
and, technical assistance (e.g., Programmatic Human Development TA). The WBG is also expected to continue
to work with the Employment Agency ISKUR on the effectiveness of vocational training programs.
61.
Outcome 3: Improved investment and business climate, and deepened and broadened access to
ﬁnance. The main objective of the ongoing Second Access to Finance for SMEs Project (FY10) is to broaden and
deepen the access of Turkish small and medium enterprises to medium- and long-term ﬁnance, with a view to
ultimately contributing to an expansion of productive activities and job creation. The Fourth Export Finance
Intermediation Loan (FY08) supports exports by providing medium and long-term working capital and
investment ﬁnance to private exporting enterprises, and improves the ability of the ﬁnancial sector to provide
ﬁnancial resources to ﬁrms through development of ﬁnancial intermediaries. Proposed CPS milestones and
activities that help achieve them are expected to include:
•
•

•
•

•

The development and completion of a review of the national competition policy framework, reﬂecting
policy dialogue with the Turkish Competition Authority and through the planned programmatic DPL
in support of growth, competitiveness and employment.
Introduction of simpliﬁed administration for licenses and permits, such as a ‘one stop-shop’, or more broadly
(under discussion): formulation of a national strategy for regulatory reform, reﬂecting technical
assistance (e.g., Investment Climate and Competitiveness TA). The regulatory reform strategy would
cover: (a) the formal use of Regulatory Impact Analysis for the introduction of new regulations, (b)
an increase in the transparency of the regulatory process, including through formal consultation with
stakeholders; and (c) the introduction of a well-deﬁned administrative simpliﬁcation program for
Turkey, with speciﬁc monitorable goals.
Identiﬁcation of regional dimensions of the challenges and opportunities facing the private sector to inform
future policy, reﬂecting, for example, the implementation and ﬁnancing of regional Investment
Climate Assessments (ICA), building on the 2010 ICA.
Development of policy options for a legal framework to help foster the commercialization of public
research and for rebalancing incentives for private research, reﬂecting policy dialogue, analysis, and TA
focused on reforms to help increase the efﬁciency of R&D expenditures and enhance the role of the
private sector in R&D21.
Improved SMEs’ and exporters’ access to longer-term funding, with an enhanced capacity of
intermediaries to appraise investment projects with longer maturity proﬁles: IBRD expects to continue
ﬁnancing lines of credit for SMEs (including focus on speciﬁc sectors like agri-business and micro
enterprises) and exporters. IFC expects to invest more than US$800 million in the ﬁnancial sector
during FY12-15 with emphasis on (a) ﬁnancial inclusion by focusing on underserved sectors and
regions like upgrading agribusiness productive assets; (b) gender ﬁnance by enabling banks to focus
on women-owned SME’s; (c) development of new ideas and products, including the development of

21 Turkey has the goal for R&D expenditure to reach 3 percent of GDP and private sector R&D spending to reach 2 percent of GDP by 2023 (Decree
adopted in 23rd Meeting of Supreme Council for Science and Technology). In 2010 (latest available ﬁgure) R&D expenditure was 0.84 percent of
GDP.

24

•

the Turkish corporate bond market; and, (d) South-South cooperation. If needed, IFC would be able
to provide a rapid and coordinated crisis response in Turkey that is demand driven and can be quickly
rolled out with active coordination with other IFIs.
Enhanced ﬁnancial sector effectiveness, reﬂecting technical assistance (e.g., Financial Sector Development
TA) on broadening the investor base for non-bank liabilities, enhancing the capacity of bank regulators
in evaluating system risks, and deepening ﬁnancial intermediation.

62.
Support provided to Turkey in governance and reforms of public ﬁnancial management systems
is a part of the World Bank Group’s Governance and Anticorruption Agenda (GAC). The Bank’s approach
to governance aims both to directly improve the development effectiveness of its own support to Turkey
as well as strengthening Turkey’s country systems. As country ownership and leadership are vital in the
implementation of the World Bank’s GAC agenda, work in this area will continue to be driven by client
demand. In this regard, support for the Government’s new governance framework for SOEs will be
particularly important; and will complement work carried out in the previous CPS.
Strategic Objective 2: Improved Equity and Public Services
World Bank Group contributing to:
Outcome 4: Improved quality and coverage of early childhood education
Outcome 5: A more effective and ﬁnancially sustainable health system; other countries expressed
interest to learn from Turkey’s good experience
Outcome 6: Progress made toward gender equity
Outcome 7: Improved public services and governance
63.
Outcome 4: Improved quality and coverage of early childhood education (ECE). Turkey and the
WBG plan CPS activities to contribute to an expansion in coverage and improvements in early childhood
education (ECE) toward the broader objective of equality of opportunities for all. World Bank support for
the development and implementation of a program to expand and improve ECE in Turkey will build on
current progress to achieve universal enrollment of ﬁve-year olds by 2014 and may include a combination of
programmatic analytic work, technical support and a ﬁnancing operation. The Government’s ECE program
is expected to include a sound quality assurance system and, possibly, targeted resources for disadvantaged
children and lagging provinces.
64.
Outcome 5: A more effective and ﬁnancially sustainable health system; other countries expressed
interest to learn from Turkey’s good experience. The WBG plans to support the Government’s Health
Transformation Program (HTP) as outlined in the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) Strategic Plan 2010-14, which
aims to improve the coverage, effectiveness and ﬁnancial sustainability of health services in Turkey. The
ongoing Health Transformation and Social Security Reform APL2 is contributing to these results through
support to increase the effectiveness of the Social Security Institute (SSI) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in
formulating and implementing reforms in provider payments and health systems performance, and piloting
output-based ﬁnancing for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. CPS activities are expected
to include capacity building support to the Ministry of Health to carry out its stewardship functions, continued
strengthening of the family medicine program, improvements in provider payment systems, and a focus on
pharmaceutical spending and the rational use of drugs. Studies and technical support (e.g., Programmatic
ESW on Health, including evaluation of the family medicine model, impact evaluation of positive incentives,
rational use of drugs, and evaluation of beneﬁts package and burden of diseases) are expected to be elements
of WBG engagement. An operation, potentially featuring results-based disbursements, is expected to support

25

this agenda. The HTP is already recognized as a global ‘good practice’ reform and under the CPS, modalities
are expected to be explored for sharing this experience in the region and beyond. The Turkish Ministry of
Health’s ‘Health Care Public Private Partnership Program’ and its strategic plan aims at providing affordable
services beyond major urban areas. IFC plans to support it with tailoring ﬁnancing products for healthcare
companies.
65.
Outcome 6: Progress made toward gender equity. The CPS program plans to support government
efforts to increase women’s access to economic opportunities, particularly access to formal employment and
entrepreneurship. In the new CPS, Turkey and the WBG plan to build on the momentum of debate among
the public and policy makers partly fueled by a Female Labor Force Participation Study in Turkey completed
in 200922. Analytical work and TA are expected to support efforts to help (i) low skilled women ﬁnd formal
employment; (ii) increase access to affordable child care; (iii) improve gender equity in the workplace;
and, (iv) increase female entrepreneurship. The Government and the private sector expect an expansion of
employment activation programs for low skilled women. The ongoing implementation of a WBG supported
pilot gender certiﬁcation program will promote the incorporation of gender equity as an internal business
practice for enhancing equal job opportunities. Completion of the piloting and national expansion of the
model is expected in the course of this CPS. In addition, work is planned on gender equity in the private
sector. IFC intends to encourage women to receive bank ﬁnancing to serve better women-owned businesses,
which represent almost 40 percent of registered SMEs. In order to promote ‘Banking on Women’ in Turkey,
IFC will establish a platform for Turkish banks to scale up their reach to women-owned SMEs. IFC will offer
a package of investment and advisory services to interested ﬁnancial institutions, encouraging them to focus
on women owned businesses.
66.
Outcome 7: Improved public services and governance. The WBG plans to continue its programmatic
engagement in public expenditure and ﬁnancial management with analytic studies and technical assistance.
WBG support includes policy recommendations for the transport sector in a Public Expenditure Review
(FY12), and continuation of the work on a Citizen Score Card system. The WBG expects to also work closely
with the Turkish Government to support its efforts to strengthen the ﬁnancial management and ﬁscal
position of local administrations and improve SOE governance. In education services, the CPS is expected
to support government efforts to raise l earning standards through improved education access, quality and
equity including stronger governance mechanisms. Studies and technical assistance are planned to support
efforts to (i) develop a more objective and transparent education ﬁnancing system that allocates funding
according to costs (as opposed to inputs); (ii) provide additional resources to disadvantaged schools; (iii)
increase school ﬁnancial autonomy; and (iv) increase school and teacher governance accountability (e.g.,
through school report cards). The School Development Program under the ongoing Secondary Education
Project (FY05) is expected to deliver about 3,500 grants to disadvantaged schools throughout Turkey. IFC will
explore opportunities to play an increasing role in the transport sector, given substantial funding gaps created
by the current market dislocations and withdrawal of many traditional project ﬁnance banks from the market.
IFC expects to support private sector participation in the ﬁnancing and operation of motorways and bridges
through debt and equity as well as the mobilization of funds from other ﬁnancial institutions.

Strategic Objective 3: Deepened Sustainable Development
World Bank Group contributing to:
Outcome 8: Improved supply of reliable and efﬁcient energy, increased use of renewable energy sources
and climate actions under implementation
Outcome 9: Strengthened environmental management and adaptation to climate change
Outcome 10: Improved sustainability of Turkish cities
67.
Outcome 8: Improved supply of reliable and efﬁcient energy, increased use of renewable energy
sources and climate actions under implementation. During the FY12-15 CPS, Turkey and the WBG will
continue addressing energy, environmental and climate change in an integrated fashion—an approach that
has proved successful during the FY08-11 CPS. Milestones include: (i) improvements in energy security,
through the commissioning of at least 10,000 MW new generation capacity, reduction/avoidance of electricity
supply/demand imbalances, and/or conclusion of new gas import contracts, (ii) expansion of renewable
energy, through increased renewable energy investments, measured by renewable electricity generation as a
percentage of total generation, from 19 percent in 2009 to 30 percent or more in 2015, (iii) implementation of
the Climate Change Action Plan with the help of technical assistance, (iv) the adoption of an Energy Efﬁciency
Strategy, and (v) the adoption of market-based mechanism for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Private
Sector Renewable Energy and Energy Efﬁciency Project (FY09) is helping to increase privately owned and
operated energy production from indigenous renewable sources, enhance demand-side energy efﬁciency,
and thereby help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The ongoing Energy Community for South East Europe
Project (FY11) will increase the reliability and capacity of the power transmission system in Turkey and
improve its ability to integrate renewable energy into the system. Planned or possible energy sector CPS
activities to help achieve these milestones include:
i.

Continued AAA with an emphasis on energy efﬁciency and renewable energy.

ii.

A third operation in the Programmatic Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector (ESES) DPL
series. The ESES DPL 3 program will revolve around further electricity and gas sector restructuring,
further electricity market development, renewable energy, the National Climate Change Action Plan,
and transposition of EU’s Large Combustion Plants directive.

iii.

Investment ﬁnancing to support energy security, greenhouse gas emissions limitation through
renewable energy development, energy efﬁciency in private ﬁrms, in the building sector, and in
electricity production; to help the Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation (TEIAS) integrate
renewable energy into the national power system; and to help integrate renewable energy generation
to the distribution system; and/or to help ensure adequacy of funding for the gas storage facility.

iv.

Turkey’s participation in the World Bank-managed Partnership for Market Readiness provides the
opportunity to exchange views and learn from the experience of about 15 other middle-income
countries.

v.

EU IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) grant support for complex energy sector reforms
and programs may draw on WBG managed analytical and TA support, possibly starting in 2012 with
initial funding of around EUR 11.8 million (subject to a satisfactory project ﬁche). Such input will help
maintain the reform momentum and strengthen institutional capacities in the areas of power and gas
market development, energy efﬁciency and renewable energy integration as pointed out in the Multiannual Indicative Planning Document as energy sector priorities.

27

vi.

IFC also plans to emphasize ﬁnancing for sustainable energy, renewable energy (e.g., geothermal,
hydro, and wind power), and gas distribution projects. IFC will focus on projects with high
development impact that cannot be achieved through alternative investments resulting in signiﬁcant
GHG emission reductions and projects where IFC can play a mobilization role. IFC will increasingly
seek opportunities to invest in large ticket equity investments utilizing the Asset Management
Company and the new Global Infrastructure Fund.

68.
Outcome 9: Strengthened environmental management and adaptation to climate change. WBG
support for sustainable and equitable resource management and environmental protection is expected to
focus on the implementation of EU environmental acquis, and exploring the options for Turkey to invest in
environmentally sustainable growth (including sustainable accounting, carbon markets, climate adaptation
in climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture and water management, and forestry management, including
completion of the National Basin Management Strategy). Using AAA, the WBG plans to support the
formulation of Turkey’s position at the Rio+20 Conference. The continuation of the programmatic AAA on
National Watershed Management is expected to include the development of a methodology for integrating the
cumulative impact assessment of water usage installations in river basins in the current legislation, effective
monitoring and evaluation tools, and more effective targeting of investments using social, environmental,
and economic criteria. The ﬁnal operation in the Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector (ESES)
Development Policy Loan series is expected to cover the implementation of environmental policies—including,
for example, further harmonization with relevant EU legislation, strengthening the environmental permitting
and enforcement processes, and further development and use of economic instruments.
69.
Outcome 10: Improved sustainability of Turkish cities. The CPS envisages support for Turkey’s
response to its urbanization challenge through the Sustainable Cities Program. Using the Integrated Urban
Development Strategy and Action Plan 2010-2023 as a basis, the sustainable cities program is expected to
provide an umbrella framework for partners in government, civil society, ﬁnancing institutions, among others,
and the WBG to work together in a multi-sector manner to support: (i) policy analysis and advice in areas
of urban development such as urban transport, housing and land markets, urban transformation including
an assessment of risk, improving city management, fostering agglomeration and regional development,
improved urban/rural linkages, and ﬁnancing of cities; (ii) capacity building for government agencies, cities
and domestic ﬁnancing institutions to assess and strengthen ﬁnancial capacity of cities; (iii) the use of global
experience for monitoring city sustainability and livability; and (iv) investment ﬁnancing, possibly through
Iller Bank, for environmental and energy efﬁciency investments in cities. As the Sustainable Cities Program
develops over time, other areas and mechanisms of engagement may be added. Along with the Bank, IFC will
contribute to the Sustainable Cities Program by providing support at the municipal level to build ﬁnancial
management capacity and improve project preparation and implementation standards. IFC can draw on a
wide range of products including straight senior loans, both in EUR and local currency, channeling its funds
through local banks with a portfolio approach, and foreign exchange hedging for EUR denominated loans. IFC
expects to seek collaboration with local banks in expanding access to ﬁnance to underserved municipalities.
The World Bank and IFC/Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility launched a joint initiative to provide
technical assistance to Turkey’s central government and local administrations in an effort to help improve the
ﬁnancial and environmental sustainability and the efﬁciency of public service delivery at the municipal level.
The ongoing disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness program in Istanbul will undergo a detailed
evaluation. On the basis of this information, an expansion of Turkey’s disaster mitigation program will be
discussed.
70.
The World Bank Group plans to explore with Turkish counterparts, over the CPS period, the possible
scope for collaboration in addressing selected rural development challenges. Areas to be explored include:
policies for strengthening rural competitiveness and managing rural-urban migration; technical assistance

28

and possibly ﬁnancing for the development of innovative rural investments including for the modernization
of agri-business; and, technical assistance in areas such as basin management, land consolidation, sustainable
tourism to foster local economic development, and adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector.
Building on the ongoing dialogue and analytic and advisory work, the CPS Progress Report may identify
further speciﬁc activities for inclusion in the FY14-15 CPS program.

A Cross-Cutting Partnership Dimension: Sharing Turkey’s Experience – Results, Knowledge and
Capacity
71.
Turkey’s development success and a number of its economic and social reforms have attracted
international interest and recognition. Turkey is also increasingly interested in expanding and strengthening
certain elements of its international development cooperation. Together, Turkey and the World Bank are
exploring avenues to collaborate in sharing Turkey’s experiences abroad. Areas of particular interest include
health sector reform and disaster prevention and mitigation (see Box 2). The WBG’s ‘value-added’ in sharing
development experience is the breadth and strength of its global network, and its credibility as the premier
global development institution and ‘honest broker’ in validating international good practice. As one initial
step, work has begun to explore trade relations between Turkey and its neighbors. Teams from Turkey,
the Middle East and North Africa, and the Caucasus identiﬁed opportunities where the World Bank might
support the regional sharing of Turkish success. Other World Bank tools available include support from WBI,
the South-South Experience Exchange Trust Fund (SSTF), the Knowledge Platforms Initiative, and the Global
Expert Teams.

29

Box 2: Sharing Turkey’s Experience—Two Success Stories

Effective Disaster Risk Mitigation and Management: Istanbul’s Experience
The Istanbul Governorship launched the Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project
(ISMEP) in 2005 to help Istanbul prepare for potential earthquakes. The project pioneered an innovative approach
of combining a focus on preventative investments (especially the retroﬁtting or reconstruction of schools and
hospitals) and programs (e.g., broad public awareness campaigns) with disaster response investments (state of the
art disaster management center with modern equipment and communications) and supportive measures, such as
for an improved enforcement of building codes and land use plans—as well as, a ﬁrst in Turkey, the development
of a digital inventory for cultural heritage buildings and pilot designs for the seismic strengthening of buildings.
Initially supported with a US$550 million IBRD loan, the project has attracted a total ﬁnancing of Euro 969.8 million
(about US$1.3 billion) from International Financial Institutions. The Istanbul Governorship, with the support of the
National Disaster Management Presidency under the Prime Ministry, and through the Istanbul Project Coordination
Unit (IPCU), is already sharing its experience with other countries in neighboring regions and globally, and plans to
continue to expand and strengthen these activities during the CPS period. Activities will include the dissemination
of the project methodology, guidelines, and publications; the provision of training through training modules,
training materials, or training of trainers; public campaign models; workshops, seminars and conferences; on-site
surveys; and customized project design, implementation, and dissemination activities based on needs assessments.
Health Sector Reform: Delivering Affordable Universal Health Insurance and Quality Health Care to All
The transformation of Turkey’s health sector and health service delivery systems through the implementation of
the Health Transformation Program (HTP) since 2003 has attracted many countries’ attention, and Turkey has already
entered in a number of cooperation agreements. One of the goals of the Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Health
(MOH) is to share its successful experience systematically and expand and strengthen the collaboration on the design
and implementation of health policies and delivery systems with other countries and national and international
institutions. Speciﬁcally, the MOH aims to (i) increase the number and quality of projects with international
institutions, (ii) enter into new cooperation agreements, (iii) strengthen its own efﬁciency and effectiveness in
engaging with international institutions, (iv) implement projects and programs for third countries, and (v) conduct
training and research activities for and with foreigners who come to Turkey under the framework agreements.
Neighboring countries, countries in the Balkans and Central Asia, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, African
and other interested countries are potential partners. Some initial priority areas for MOH in sharing its success
story include health system analysis, the development of training programs, and the preparation of presentation
and training materials on the HTP and speciﬁc topics

30

31

VI. IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation of the FY12-15 Partnership Strategy
Managing the Program
72.
Analytical and Advisory Services (AAA) are central to the Turkey-World Bank partnership and are
expected to grow further—programmatic multi-year; ‘discrete’ single-year; and, ‘just-in-time’ AAA. In the
new CPS, Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and technical assistance are expected to be ﬁnanced in two ways.
While the World Bank’s core provision of AAA will continue, Turkey and the World Bank will explore and
complement the core AAA program with cost sharing activities. Cost sharing, as an element of the TurkeyWBG partnership, is expected to enable the Government to select, design, and pursue additional tasks.
73.
The ﬁnancing framework provides for up to US$4.45 billion in the CPS FY12-15 period. Development
Policy operations (DPL) have a proven record of combining policy advice and support and ﬂexible ﬁnancing
and are expected to continue to play an important role. At the same time, the proportion of investment
ﬁnancing, as a constituent part of the overall lending envelope, is expected to increase. Reﬂecting lessons
learnt from the previous CPS, the timing and composition of IBRD ﬁnancing is expected to be managed
ﬂexibly, allowing for ﬁnancing across instruments and areas of engagement in response to evolving global
conditions and country priorities within the overall envelope. During the next CPS, Turkey and the World
Bank also intend to explore the use of new investment ﬁnancing instruments like Program for Results.
74.
IFC aims to tailor its program in Turkey to achieve maximum development impact. Although IFC’s
investment volume is not expected to increase, its strategy is ﬂexible and consistent with the WBG’s approach
to MICs. IFC aims to adjust its areas of intervention, products and instruments to the country’s needs – focused
on its competitiveness agenda and employment creation. IFC expects to target under-served segments of
the economy, providing ﬁnancing in areas including Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises; energy efﬁciency
and renewable energy; municipalities; and, poorer regions in the country. IFC intends to continue promoting
South-South investments and supporting Turkish companies to invest in the region and further abroad.
75.
The Turkey World Bank Group partnership covers only a small part of Turkey’s development
program. WBG ﬁnancing therefore accounts for only a small fraction of Turkey’s total external ﬁnancing23. In
the new CPS, the WBG’s contribution is targeted at providing mainly catalytic support. Direct attribution will
remain challenging, if not often impossible—although Turkey’s continued high demand for WBG services may
provide an imperfect, indirect indicator of their ‘value-added’. In this assessment it is important to remember
that demand for IBRD services continues to exceed already high levels of new ﬁnancing and knowledge
services IBRD is able to provide, given ﬁnancial risk management considerations and budget limitations.
Loan Portfolio and Pipeline Management
76.
IBRD’s portfolio is expected to remain concentrated and strategically focused. An effort to
concentrate and increase the focus of the lending portfolio has resulted in fewer, larger operations. The average
investment loan size increased from US$245 million in FY08, to US$339 at the end of FY11. As of January 2012,
23

The scale of WBG ﬁnancing, averaging US$1.9 billion in new commitments and US$1.71 billion in disbursements during FY08-11, was very
small when compared with Turkey’s total public debt, which was US$321.4 billion in 2010, and it amounted to 23 percent of Turkey’s average
public external borrowing (US$8.43 billion between 2007-2010) and less than 1 percent of its average total gross external debt per year (US$266
billion) between 2007-2009.

32

the Turkey portfolio features 14 projects and US$5.56 billion in net commitments, compared to 24 projects and
US$5.67 billion at the end FY07. Portfolio quality has continued to increase, supported by concerted efforts
and joint management of the portfolio with the Government. A proactive approach to implementation issues
translated in a signiﬁcant decrease in problem projects, from ﬁve at end-FY09 to one in the ﬁrst half of FY12.
Good progress in project implementation is reﬂected in a disbursement ratio of 31% at end-FY11, and of 20%
during the ﬁrst half of FY12.
77.
A procurement review is planned to increase efﬁciency and help address challenges arising from
differences between national procurement laws and those of the World Bank Group. The proposed review
will help the Bank to recognize the debarment under national law within the framework described in the
January 2011 Procurement Guidelines as well as to understand the national rules. As the national procurement
law does not allow contracts to be awarded to nationally debarred ﬁrms not only in national competitive
bidding but also in international competitive bidding contracts, there is a danger that procurement processes
might create reputational and implementation risks which could prove difﬁcult to resolve. The planned
Procurement Review is expected to explore this issue and seek to identify systemic solutions. In anticipation
of potential results-based projects in health and education sectors, the World Bank will conduct a dialogue on
procurement with the Government and undertake procurement assessments to underpin project preparation
and monitoring of such operations.
Working with Development Agencies and Partners
78.
Good and broad relations with civil society remain an important part of the Turkey-World Bank
Group Partnership. Continuing with work begun in the previous CPS, where civil society participated in the
preparation and implementation of projects including the HTP and ISMEP, the World Bank aims to broaden
and deepen its relationship. The World Bank intends to continue using its convening power: working with
the Turkish Investment Advisory Council; Parliament; and, developing new avenues for engagement with
civil society, including organizations like TEPAV (Training and Research Institute for Public Policy), as it
looks to support Turkey in sharing knowledge and expertise regionally and globally. Beyond consultations
undertaken with civil society in developing this CPS, the World Bank will also seek to ensure that it maximizes
the effectiveness of its relations with academia, think tanks, private sector associations and businesses, as well
as NGOs.
79.
A continued strong and good relationship with development partners. The World Bank aims to
continue working closely with the IMF, sharing expertise on macroeconomic and a broad range of structural
issues. It intends to continue its close working relationship with the UNDP and UNICEF in Ankara. Turkey,
the WBG and the European Union are working closely together to further strengthen alignment on ‘Europe
2020’, while also seeking to strengthen their multi-lateral relationship. Regular meetings are planned between
the EU Commission and the World Bank’s Europe and Central Asia Vice-Presidency; the ﬁrst of which took
place in October 2010 with the EU’s Directorate General for Employment and second of which is planned in
March 2012. A new phase of tripartite institutional partnership may provide new opportunities for closer
operational cooperation in important sectors including energy. For example, working alongside the European
Commission and Turkey’s ministries for EU Affairs and Energy and Natural Resources, World Bank technical
and analytical assistance on energy is currently scheduled for 2012 EU IPA funding of about EUR€ 10 million.
The WBG also expects to look to further relations with bilateral partners – building on the pilot project run
by the World Bank’s private sector team (ECSPF) on the simpliﬁcation of administrative procedures with the
UK Foreign and Commonwealth Ofﬁce (FCO) in FY12. IFC intends to continue working closely with other
IFIs, including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Black Sea Trade & Development
Bank, and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau Bankengruppe (German Development Bank).

33

VII. RISKS
80.
The outcomes targeted by this CPS are subject to economic and external risks. Increasing
global uncertainty and, deteriorating prospects for economic growth and stability in Europe and other
developed economies create downside risks to the global demand for Turkish exports, to output growth
and correspondingly ﬁscal performance, and to the availability of international private capital ﬂows
to ﬁnance Turkish investments. The main macroeconomic risk is a reversal of capital ﬂows, which could
cause a signiﬁcant growth slowdown, given the high level and the short-term nature of the ﬁnancing of the
current account deﬁcit. There is also a risk of further systemic disruption in the global ﬁnancial system, with
potentially signiﬁcant ripple effects on the Turkish economy. The key to mitigating the most severe risks
of further global economic disruption lies in sound economic management – and in particular measures to
contain and reduce the current account deﬁcit. Over the medium term, higher productivity, higher exports to
more diverse markets, higher domestic savings, and greater energy efﬁciency and diversiﬁcation are the keys
to reducing Turkey’s reliance on external ﬁnance.
81.
Risks of natural disasters, while mitigated by some World Bank supported programs, remain.
Turkey is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes, and within the nation’s high-risk context, Istanbul is most
vulnerable due to its seismic-prone location on the North Anatolian Fault, and its high population and
commercial and industrial densities. As the recent, tragic, earthquakes in the Van region have shown the
preparation for and the mitigation of risks associated with seismic activity remain a foremost development
challenge for Turkey and the WBG and the Turkish authorities expect to maintain ongoing dialogue on this
issue over the course of the new CPS.
82.
Implementation risks. Social consensus on the reform program and institutional capacity are needed
for the implementation of the CPS which supports the Government’s Ninth Development Plan. The complexity
and social impact of many elements of the reform program require consensus building among all interested
groups. This is a process which takes time and results in compromises. However, the implementation of
reforms would be more problematic without the careful application of such processes. A systematic policy
dialogue with country counterparts on World Bank supported project preparation and implementation,
and analytic and advisory work can support countries’ reform process. Institutional capacity building, in
particular in the area of monitoring and evaluation, strengthens the implementation of policies and projects.

MACROECONOMIC ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments24
1.
After a banking crisis in 2001, when GDP contracted by 5.7 percent, and an expensive recapitalization
of its banks, Turkey embarked on a path of concerted structural reforms. Reforms were wide-spanning and
aimed at improving ﬁscal and public ﬁnancial management, strengthening banking supervision, introducing
a comprehensive social security reform, and revamping the framework for macroeconomic management,
within which an independent CBRT is responsible for inﬂation-targeting.
2.
Turkey’s macroeconomic policies and structural reforms over the past decade have yielded robust
economic growth. Real GDP increased by 50 percent between 2001 and 2010 and the average growth rate
was nearly 7 percent during 2003-07, up from an average of 4 percent during the 1990s. Growth resumed
rapidly after the 2008-2009 global crisis, at 9 percent in 2010 and 9.6 percent in the ﬁrst three quarters of 2011.
Per capita income almost tripled since 2002 and now stands at US$ 10,067. Public sector primary balance
averaged about 2.8 percent of GDP over 2004-10 and gross public debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 73.4
percent in 2002 to 45 percent in 2010, in spite of a moderate increase during the 2008-09 global crisis. Inﬂation
came down from a high of around 70 percent to under 10 percent. Healthy export growth (13 percent per
year over 2004-10) contributed to limiting external vulnerability. On the back of strong reserve build up,
improvements in the country’s prospects were also signaled by upgrades post- 2008 and outlook revisions
by all the main credit rating agencies. More recently, in September 2011 S&P raised Turkey’s local-currency
rating by one notch to BBB-. In November 2011 Fitch changed Turkey’s sovereign debt rating outlook from
positive to stable while keeping the rating at BB+, reﬂecting increasing near term risks to macroeconomic
stability (see below).
3.
The Government adopted expansionary macroeconomic policies during the 2008-2009 global crisis.
Turkey suffered from a short but sharp fall in GDP (4.8 percent) in 2009 reﬂecting a strong deterioration of
investor and consumer conﬁdence and a drop in external demand and capital inﬂows. The current account
deﬁcit narrowed signiﬁcantly as imports reacted strongly to the sharp slow-down in domestic demand while
exports were less affected. Foreign direct investment slowed considerably from 2.3 percent of GDP (US$
17 billion) in 2008 to 1.1 percent of GDP in 2009 (US$ 6.9 billion). Unemployment reached a high of 16.1
percent in February 2009, an increase of 35 percent compared with the same time in 2008. The authorities
moved quickly to maintain conﬁdence and liquidity in the banking sector (including through a reduction in
reserve requirements and the reintroduction of a ‘blind-broker’ lending facility), and implemented a set of
employment measures, as well as ﬁscal stimuli. Between October 2008 and November 2009, the overnight
interest rate was cut by a cumulative 10.25 percentage points. The general government ﬁscal deﬁcit increased
sharply from 1.6 percent in 2008 to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009, due mainly to the operation of automatic
stabilizers (such as the increase of approximately 1.8 percentage points of GDP in budgetary transfer to the
Social Security Institution (SSI)). Facilitated by expansionary policies, unemployment peaked by mid-2009
and output began to recover by the last quarter of 2009.
4.
Turkey recovered from the 2009 recession with a GDP growth of 9 percent in 2010 and 9.6 percent
during the ﬁrst three quarters of 2011, facilitated by rapid credit growth25 and high capital inﬂows on
the back of global liquidity and healthy Turkish balance sheets. Output is now almost ten percent higher
than its pre-crisis peak. During the past two years, growth has been driven by domestic consumption and
investment demand from the private sector, fueled by historically low interest rates. In 2010 economic
growth was 9 percent; of this, private consumption and private investment accounted for a sizeable share
(about 5 percentage points each, with net exports making a negative contribution; see Table 1). With very
low domestic savings, and on the back of healthy Turkish balance sheets and quantitative easing in some

Annualized weekly credit growth peaked at 50 percent in January 2011.

advanced economies, growth has relied on short-term, capital inﬂows (mostly mediated by the banking
system) to ﬁnance imports, while Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has remained subdued. This has in turn
contributed signiﬁcantly to the widening of the current account deﬁcit.
5.
High growth of imports (in particular of capital and intermediate goods) led to a rapid rise in
Turkey’s current account deﬁcit (CAD), from an 8-year low in 2009 to historic highs during 2011. The CAD
widened from US$ 14 billion (2.3 percent of GDP) in 2009 to US$ 47.1 billion (6.4 percent of GDP) in 2010
and 77.8 billion as of November 2011 (9.8 percent of GDP) on a 12-month rolling basis. Furthermore, the
composition of the CAD deteriorated with the share of FDI in total inﬂows falling from 45 percent in 2007 to
18 percent in 2011 (Figure 1). Although energy accounts for a large share of the trade deﬁcit (nearly 5 percent
of GDP on average in recent years), the non-energy balance contributed signiﬁcantly to the deterioration. The
private sector accounted for the bulk of the CAD, and private external indebtedness increased correspondingly,
from US$ 188 billion in 2008 to US$ 202.2 billion in 2011. The reliance on high level and short-term nature of
the ﬁnancing of the current account deﬁcit will likely continue in the near future, with the associated risks of
a signiﬁcant growth slowdown should Turkey be hit by growing risk aversion in global ﬁnancial markets.

Unemployment has fallen below pre-crisis levels, notwithstanding an increase in labor force
participation, but it remains high. After peaking at above 16 percent in February 2009, seasonally adjusted
unemployment has decreased steadily falling to 9.1 percent by October 2011, improving upon pre-crisis levels.
Nonetheless, open unemployment in Turkey remains high in absolute terms, and the Turkish labor market
is characterized by low activity rates and high job informality. The employment rate of working age (15-64)
women in 2010 is the lowest among OECD and Europe and Central Asia countries. And about 40 percent of
those employed are working in the informal sector, although job informality has been decreasing somewhat.

Gross public debt as deﬁned by the Undersecretariat of Treasury varies from the EU deﬁned general government debt stock deﬁnition. The
difference arises from the following adjustment items for EU deﬁned debt: (i) recording of zero coupon securities at face value; (ii) inclusion of
inﬂation variation for CPI indexed bonds; (iii) inclusion of coins in circulation issued by Treasury; and, exclusion of the government securities held
by different public sector institutions, (iv) exclusion of debt stocks of SOEs. *actualized

7.
High growth has translated into continuing improvements in the headline ﬁscal balance, but
primary spending remains above pre-crisis levels. The general government ﬁscal deﬁcit declined from 5.5
percent of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 1.2 percent in 2011 and, after a crisis-related increase in 2008, the public
debt to GDP ratio has resumed its downward trend. The decline in the ﬁscal deﬁcit reﬂects the strong cyclical
nature of tax revenues, but a comprehensive tax restructuring program and a reduction in the interest bill
have also contributed. However, primary spending remains signiﬁcantly above the pre-crisis level, primarily
due to higher capital investment, wage and pension spending. There has been structural loosening in recent
years, from a structural primary surplus equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2007 to an estimated deﬁcit of
around one percent of GDP in 2011.

8.
Facing difﬁcult policy trade-offs, CBRT has implemented an ‘unorthodox’ policy, moving to a
tightening stance in late 2011. A weak global economy, and the transition from large capital inﬂows and
upward pressure on the lira in 2010 to declining inﬂows and lira depreciation pressures in 2011 have created
difﬁcult economic policy trade-offs. In late 2010, in response to surging capital inﬂows, CBRT adopted an
‘unorthodox’ monetary policy cutting overnight interest rates in an effort to discourage portfolio investors
from taking short-term ‘carry trade’ positions in lira assets, while at the same time increasing reserve
requirements to curtail domestic credit. The lira weakened signiﬁcantly as a result, while credit growth began
to slow following the introduction of macro-prudential measures by the Banking Regulation and Supervision
Authority only in June 2011. Prompted by concerns about the global economy and early indications of a
domestic slowdown, CBRT reduced the policy rate by 50 bps in early August 2011.
9.
Since mid-October 2011, responding to an increase in inﬂation (primarily reﬂecting pass-through
of the cumulative 30 percent nominal depreciation since November 2010), CBRT has tightened monetary
policy. It has inter alia increased overnight lending rates and engaged in large-sale foreign exchange selling
auctions and direct interventions. As a result, the interbank overnight rate increased from 6.5 percent in
December 2010 to 11.2 percent in December 2011, and the benchmark government bond yield rose from 7.11
to 11.04 percent during the same period.
10.
Turkey’s EMBI spread has continued to outperform the aggregate emerging market index. It fell
from a post-crisis high of 889 (October 27, 2008) to 265 at end-November 2009, essentially back to pre-crisis
levels. By mid-November 2010, Turkey’s EMBI spread had dropped to 159 bps, but by end-November 2011,
they surged to 352 bps (although still below the 413 bps EMBI global spread for emerging markets).
Medium-term Economic Prospects
11.
Growth is expected to slow down signiﬁcantly in 2012, before recovering to about ﬁve percent
per annum in the medium-term. The annualized weekly credit growth rate declined to 23 percent in midDecember 2011, less than half its peak of 50 percent in January 2011. On the back of slower credit growth and
falling domestic and foreign demand, growth is estimated to have slowed down already in the last quarter
of 2011, bringing the growth rate for the year at around eight percent. Real GDP growth is expected to slow
down to about three percent in 2012. The macroeconomic outlook beyond 2012 is more favorable and, in line
with Government’s Medium-Term Program (MTP), projects a GDP growth rate of around ﬁve percent per
annum, driven largely by strong private-sector led domestic demand. The projected growth is predicated on
capital inﬂows ﬁnancing a current account deﬁcit of 5-6 percent over the medium term.
12.
This growth path is predicated on continued progress on Turkey’s unﬁnished structural reform
agenda. Such reforms include the implementation of the new commercial code and the code of obligations,
the labor market reform, measures to bolster long-term ﬁscal savings, and steps to reduce the dependency on
imports of fuel through an expansion of renewable energy use in electricity generation and improvements
in energy efﬁciency. The current account deﬁcit is projected to narrow in the outer years (on the back of
structural reforms and enhanced competitiveness as well as a recovery in global growth) and supported by
higher domestic savings.
13.
The MTP envisages gradual improvements in ﬁscal balances. On the public sector side, Table 2
shows a shift from a 1.0 percent public sector primary deﬁcit in 2009 to a 1.4 percent surplus by 2014, with the
general government balance shifting correspondingly from a 5.5 percent deﬁcit in 2009 to a 0.5 percent deﬁcit
in 2014. Given current global economic uncertainties, the Authorities need to remain vigilant and avoid ﬁscal
policy slippages. This will help limit risks, which can rapidly increase in the current volatile environment,
strengthen investor conﬁdence, and moderate aggregate demand.

Annex 2

44

14.
The ﬁscal adjustment over 2012-14 will come mainly from expenditure measures. General
government expenditures as a share of GDP are projected to decline, from the 2009 level of about 40 percent,
to about 36.8 percent by 2014, leading to a declining borrowing requirement. The decrease in spending over
the MTP period is driven by a decline in current expenditures, mainly cuts in goods and services spending,
and a decrease in current transfers to the Social Security Institutions (because of the improvements in its
balance).

15.
External ﬁnancing needs will remain high in 2012-16 (Table 3). Turkey should be in a position to
attract further FDI given privatization efforts and the potential for mergers and acquisitions. The baseline
net FDI inﬂows are projected to rise from US$13 billion in 2012 to US$18.1 billion in 2016. Similarly, net
portfolio ﬂows are assumed to be positive, consistent with continued Eurobond issuance and the potential of
the domestic capital market to raise ﬁnancing. However, higher oil prices than assumed here (US$100), for
a sustained period, would create additional external ﬁnancing requirements - a risk that needs to be closely
monitored going forward. A US$10 increase in oil prices would increase the CAD by an estimated 0.4-0.5
percentage point of GDP, and would shave around 0.2-0.3 percentage points of growth.

16.
Despite the benign outlook in the baseline scenario, a combination of external and domestic
factors poses high risks going forward, including from the spillovers of the European debt crisis. Turkey’s
dependence on external ﬁnancing has left the country prone to boom-bust cycles. The weakening global
economic outlook and increasingly severe international funding strains have the potential to spill over to
Turkey. Under a deepened crisis scenario in the Euro zone and a corresponding sudden stop of capital
inﬂows to emerging markets driven by a ﬂight to safety, Turkey could possibly face a renewed recession.
17.
In such a scenario, unlike in the baseline scenario, public debt would rise. The public debt
sustainability analysis suggests that the risks to the sustainability of Turkey’s debt burden are moderate in
the baseline scenario. Under the baseline macroeconomic scenario, gross public debt is forecast to decline
from 45 percent of GDP at end-2010 to 33.2 percent of GDP by 2015. However, in the extreme downside
scenario described above the interest rate would go up, the exchange rate would depreciate and GDP contract
and ﬁscal performance would deteriorate. As a result, public debt to GDP ratio would rise to 44.4 percent
(7.4 percentage points above baseline) in 2013 before resuming its downward trend and declining to slightly
below 39 percent by 2016.

External debt dynamics are also vulnerable to a severe unfavorable shock. After declining
considerably from 56.2 percent in 2002 to 35.3 percent in 2005, external debt stood at 41.3 percent at end-2011
and is forecast to increase to 42.6 percent by end-2012 before easing to 41.1 percent by end-2016 in a baseline
scenario. However, external debt sustainability analysis shows that, in the event of a sudden stop of capital
ﬂows, the external debt to GDP ratio would rise from 41.3 percent to almost 48 percent in 2014 (5.3 pp higher
than in the baseline) (Figure 3). The pace of increase in the external debt ratio would slowdown thereafter,
with external debt to GDP at 48.6 in 2016.

TURKEY: COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY COMPLETION REPORT
World Bank Group FY08-1126

I. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
1.
The FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) between Turkey and the World Bank Group
(WBG) was carried out against the backdrop of the global ﬁnancial crisis. The global downturn had a
signiﬁcant impact on Turkey, but the economy rebounded quickly and strongly. Turkey’s robust growth
before the global crisis, resilience during the global crisis, and renewed rapid growth after the global crisis
are grounded in sustained strong economic management and fundamental and systematic structural reforms
carried out since the economic crisis in 2001 and continuing today—all supported by the WBG.
2.
Turkey expanded and strengthened its partnership with the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Cooperation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) during the CPS period. Total new IBRD ﬁnancing of USD 7.6 billion in this
CPS—an increase by USD 1.4 billion over the originally envisaged USD 6.2 billion, reﬂecting increased
ﬁnancial support to help address the impact of the global crisis—meant that by June 2011 Turkey was IBRD’s
second largest borrower, with USD 12.9 billion outstanding. Total new IFC ﬁnancing was USD 2.0 billion and
its committed portfolio grew by 82 percent. Turkey is MIGA’s 2nd largest client, as gross exposure grew by 42
percent, from USD 671.8 million in 2008 to USD 951 million at end-FY11.
3.
Turkey and the WBG adjusted the CPS at its halfway point. The modiﬁcation, laid out in the
Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR), enabled the WBG to support Turkey in its response
to the ﬁnancial crisis and the recovery of sustainable growth. The adjusted CPS centered on macroeconomic
resilience and stability; an increase in medium-term credit to the private sector, especially small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), which create around 80 percent of employment in Turkey; and medium-term structural
reforms to underpin sustained economic growth and job creation—with an additional new focus (introduced
through the CPS PR) on the environment and climate change. IFC realigned its strategy to help its clients to
survive the crisis and improve their competitiveness, while conserving and creating jobs.
4.
This self-evaluation argues that the FY08-11 CPS was successful. Both the program’s performance
in inﬂuencing CPS outcomes as laid out in the results matrix, and the WBG’s performance in designing and
managing the implementation of the program during the CPS period have been assessed as satisfactory. The
reasons for this are as follows:
•

All CPS milestones were achieved or partially achieved (see Section III below for details). Sound policies
and reforms, supported by the WBG, contributed to Turkey’s strong overall economic performance—rapid
growth, interrupted for two years by the global crisis, macroeconomic and ﬁnancial stability, and increased
employment. Moreover, policies, programs, and projects realized with the support and partnership of
the WBG produced concrete development results in key CPS areas. For example, electricity transmission
and peak capacity increased by 60 percent between 2002 and 2010. The health system’s greater reach and
efﬁciency improved health outcomes nationwide, gaining international recognition. The progress made
by the Istanbul Governorship in strengthening the city’s resilience against earthquakes, and preparedness
for responding to disasters is considered to be an international role model.

26 Date of CPS: January 25, 2008 (Report No. 42026 TR). Board discussion on February 28, 2008. Date of CPS Progress Report: December 3, 2009
(Report No.51689-TR) Prepared by Ina-Marlene Ruthenberg, Ben Welch and the Turkey Country Team. George Konda had the leadership for
IFC contributions, and Franciscus Johannes Linden for MIGA. October 26, 2011.

•

The open design, ﬂexible mid-point adaptation, and effective implementation of the CPS helped ensure
that all goals and milestones were at least partially met even in the highly challenging context of the
2008-2009 global ﬁnancial crisis. Goals and milestones that were partially rather than fully achieved
are concentrated in areas particularly sensitive to the impact of the crisis, such as increasing private
investment, improving export competitiveness, and increasing employment.

•

The CPS delivered results beyond its originally envisaged scope and goals. The WBG worked closely with
Turkey in responding to the global crisis. Support for Turkey’s energy reforms grew into collaboration
on renewable energy, energy efﬁciency, and climate change mitigation. Turkey became the ﬁrst country
to access the Clean Technology Fund (CTF). The engagement on clean energy and climate change and
customized knowledge services on watershed management and the alignment with EU environmental
regulations led to consideration of a sustainability pillar in the FY12-15 CPS.
II. PROGRESS TOWARDS COUNTRY GOALS
Turkey emerged from the global ﬁnancial crisis with an impressive rebound in GDP growth
The current account deﬁcit remains a vulnerability

5.
Turkey has made major advances towards achieving its development goals outlined in the Ninth
Development Plan27 and its Millennium Development Goals (MDG), as shown by its 2010 MDG Report.
Turkey’s per capita income almost tripled since 2002 and now exceeds USD 10,00028. Extreme poverty has
been eliminated; the primary education and maternal health goals have been achieved; signiﬁcant progress
has been made in reducing infant mortality and improving environmental sustainability; and Turkey is on
its way to reach other outstanding MDGs by 201529. EU harmonization is advancing, albeit slowly—with 13
chapters of the EU-Acquis opened and one (Science and Research) provisionally closed. Turkey increased its
net ofﬁcial development assistance from USD 67 million in 2003 to USD 967 million in 201030.
6.
Turkey’s economic stability is enhanced and its credit ratings have been upgraded,31 although the
country’s current account deﬁcit remains a critical vulnerability. After rapid economic growth before the
crisis averaging almost 7 percent during 2003-2007, GDP fell by 4.8 percent in 2009, and unemployment
peaked at 16.1 percent in February 2009 (29 percent among youth). Yet, in a rapid and strong rebound, the
Turkish economy grew by 9 percent in 2010 and by 10.2 percent in the ﬁrst half of 2011, and unemployment
fell back to pre-crisis levels, at 9.2 percent, in May-August 2011. The quick return to robust growth caps a
decade of robust growth since 2010—a decade in which sound and prudent macro-economic management,
coupled with ambitious structural economic reforms, turned Turkey into a leading international economy.
EU deﬁned gross public debt fell from 77.9 percent in 2001 to 42.2 percent in 2010 (even after the temporary
increase during the global crisis). The government’s primary surplus fell from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2006
to 0.7 percent in 2010, and the primary surplus is expected to increase in 201132. Despite broad success,
challenges remain. The largest of these is the current account deﬁcit (CAD). The 12-month rolling CAD rose
to USD 74.6 billion in June 2011, and the annualized current account as of June 2011 reached 9.3 percent of
GDP—not yet reﬂecting initial signs of a cooling down of credit, import, and output growth. More than 60
percent of the CAD reﬂects Turkey’s structural dependence on energy imports. The high CAD is a particular
vulnerability, as about half of it is ﬁnanced by short-term capital inﬂows.

Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan 2007-2013 lists these strategic objectives: increasing competitiveness, increasing employment, strengthening
human development and social solidarity, ensuring regional development, and increasing quality and effectiveness of public services.
According to TURKSTAT, per capita GDP was USD 3,492 in 2002 and USD 10,079 in 2010.
Other MDGs cover universal primary education (Goal 2), gender equality & empower women (Goal 3); child mortality (Goal 4); HIV/AIDs,
malaria & other diseases (Goal 6); ensure environmental sustainability (Goal 7); and a global partnership for development (Goal 8).

7.
The ﬁnancial sector proved resilient in the crisis, and ﬁnancial markets are deepening slowly, but
medium and long-term credit remains scarce. Credit markets are stronger and the scope of ﬁnancial services
is greater today than in 2007, at the beginning of the CPS period and before the global crisis. Bank credit
increased signiﬁcantly after 2008-09; by 2010 the share of total credit in the economy was 48 percent of GDP,
up from 32 percent of GNP in 200633. Nevertheless, while the maturity proﬁle of loan portfolios has improved,
as of end-June 2011 about 50 percent of banks’ loans had a remaining maturity of less than one year. Other
forms of ﬁnancing have expanded commensurately: leasing, factoring and consumer ﬁnance assets grew
by more than 80 percent, from TL 20 billion in 2006 to TL 36.4 billion in 2010. Bonds issued by banks have
increased almost tenfold, with TL 14.3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding in July 2011.
8.
A business climate reform program is underway, but trade performance is improving slowly after a
steep decline in 2008-2009, in part due to weak external demand. Export growth slowed in late 2010 and early
2011, held back by weak demand (particularly European)34. Foreign direct investment ﬂows also dropped
dramatically during the crisis35. Despite signiﬁcant increases in 2010 they have yet to return to pre-crisis
levels. Business climate reforms, started before the crisis, have resumed. Sweeping legislation to modernize
the investment climate and further align it with EU regulation was passed in 2010 and 2011—including a
new Commercial Code, which fundamentally reforms and is akin to a ‘new constitution’ for the corporate
sector and commerce; a new Code of Obligations; a new Civil Procedures Law; and a new Monitoring and
Supervision of State Aids Law.
9.
Employment and labour market reform is incomplete. The Government separated reforms into
two packages. The 2008 Labour Package reduced non-wage labour costs, cutting employers’ social security
contributions by 5 percent. This lowered tax loads, reduced the non-ﬁnancial costs of providing employment,
and supported the expansion of Active Labour Market Policies (ALMP). The February 2011 Omnibus Law
reduced disincentives for part-time work. The Government’s Medium-Term Program for 2011-2013 envisaged
the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive new employment strategy, including reforms to increase
labour market ﬂexibility and worker protection.
10.
Turkey’s energy reforms yielded impressive results. Effective management and regulation increased
energy security and reliable supply to households and ﬁrms. Annual output increased from 176 TWh in 2006
to 210 TWh in 2010. Electricity tariffs have allowed for full cost recovery since 2008. The private sector’s share
of distribution grew from 3 percent in 2006 to 44 percent in 2010. Renewable energy capacity and investments
increased: electricity produced by privately owned renewable generation facilities rose nine-fold, from 1,490
GWh in 2002 to 14,002 GWh in 2010; and the 2007 Energy Efﬁciency Law gives further impetus to energy
efﬁciency.
Social outcomes have improved
11.
Health outcomes have improved. Access to education and to social security has broadened. According
to government data, maternal mortality fell from 28.5 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 16.4 in 2010,
and infant mortality decreased from 25 to 10.1 per 1,000 live births in the same period—a major achievement,
although infant mortality remains high in comparison to other OECD members. Access to education has
improved substantially: primary education is now virtually universal, and secondary education enrolments
and completion are also on the rise (for details: paragraph 28). Pre-primary school enrolment, at 30 percent,
is rapidly increasing, but remains below the level of countries with similar income levels. Consumption(food
and non-food)-based poverty36 fell from 27 percent in 2002 to 17 percent in 2008 and, after a modest increase
to 18 percent in 2009 during the global crisis, is estimated to have been falling again in 2010-2011.
33 TURKSTAT calculated GNP in 2006 and calculates GDP today.
34 MTP 2011-2013 revised targets to USD 127 billion in 2011, USD 143.5 billion in 2012 & USD 160 billion in 2013.
35 Gross FDI was: USD 22 billion (2007), USD 19.5 billion (2008), USD 8.4 billion (2009) & USD 8.9 billion (2010).
36 In keeping with WBG practice in Turkey, this Completion Report uses the Turkish Government’s deﬁnition of poverty lines.

Public sector management and service delivery are improving in quality and transparency
12.
Public sector management has improved. Successful tools include medium-term projects and
budgets, strategic plans, and performance programs. Turkey’s systematic implementation of public ﬁnancial
management (PFM) reforms has improved the comprehensiveness, transparency, accountability and
credibility of government budgets, especially at the national level. It has also strengthened the capacity,
transparency, and effectiveness of the public sector and public sector service delivery throughout the central
public administration.
13.
Sustainable municipal development is key; improved disaster risk management is a success.
Turkey’s urbanization rate has reached at 65 percent. The Law on Iller Bankası A.Ş., enacted in 2011, is a
major achievement in the development of municipal infrastructure ﬁnancing and effective local ﬁnancial
management systems. Turkey’s new Integrated Urban Development Strategy and Action Plan for 20102023 lays out a comprehensive approach to city development, including spatial planning and infrastructure
prioritization. Turkey has made great strides in upgrading its disaster management system. Istanbul’s Seismic
Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project is acknowledged as a leading international example of
work in the ﬁeld.
III. DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES OF THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM
Pillar 1: Competiveness and Employment Opportunities
Macroeconomic stability and economic growth have been sustained
14.
Turkey and the WBG responded to the global economic crisis by adapting the CPS to focus on
macroeconomic resilience and stability, maintaining medium-term credit to the private sector, especially
SMEs, and medium-term structural reforms to underpin growth and job creation. The implementation
of the CPS program supported and contributed to Turkey’s achievement of robust and resilient economic
growth, improved ﬁscal performance, and a decline in inﬂation, which fell to 6.2 percent in June 2011, the end
of the CPS period.
15.
Central to the WBG’s partnership with Turkey were four programmatic DPL series, and
accompanying parallel programmatic AAA, focused on competitiveness, employment, the public sector,
energy, environmental sustainability and crisis response37. The four DPL series provided total IBRD
ﬁnancing of USD 4.4 billion. More importantly, the DPL series and parallel AAA were the key vehicle for
the WBG’s partnership and engagement with Turkey on macroeconomic policy and medium-term structural
reforms. Economic growth was also supported by 11 IBRD and 45 IFC investment projects.
Private investment, export competitiveness, and ﬁnancial sector performance felt the impact of the global
ﬁnancial crisis but proved resilient
16.
Private sector credit, including ﬁnancing for exporting ﬁrms and SMEs, has resumed rapidly after
contracting during the crisis. After remaining essentially ﬂat in real terms in 2009, total loans increased by
33.9 percent, and loans to SMEs increased by 50.6 percent, in 2010. During the entire CPS period, credit to
SMEs increased by 64 percent. The growth in total credit, and in particular SME credit, during 2007-2010
is particularly noteworthy, because the global crisis sharply curtailed credit to the private sector, especially
to SMEs. However, lending remains mostly short-term although maturities are gradually being extended,
reﬂecting a dearth of longer-term ﬁnancing. Indeed, the 2010 Investment Climate Assessment showed
that the majority of surveyed ﬁrms (especially SMEs) see themselves as restrained by problems associated
37 Development Policy Lending during CPS period:
• Competitiveness and Employment DPL 2 (CEDPL2) for USD 500 million. (CEDPL 1 was part of the previous CAS.)
• Programmatic Public Sector DPL 2 (PPDPL) for USD 400 million (PPDPL 1 was part of the previous CAS.); Restoring Equitable Growth and
Employment (REGE) DPL 1 for USD 1,300 million; and REGE DPL 2 for USD 700 million. Responding to the global crisis, the PPDPL series
continued into the REGE series, which also incorporated key elements from the remaining CEDPL agenda.
• Programmatic Electricity DPL (PEDPL) 1 for USD 800 million and Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector (ESES) DPL 2 for USD
700 million. The name of the series changed (PEDPL to ESES) when it was broadened to include climate change and the environment.

with access to ﬁnance. SMEs account for almost half of total investments, two-thirds of total retail sales,
and around 60 percent of total exports in Turkey. Both IBRD and IFC ﬁnancing helped the Turkish private
sector maintain production, exports, and employment during the crisis. IBRD lines of credit (LOC) provided
targeted support to exporting ﬁrms and SMEs. The IBRD AAA program included an evaluation of the results
of the LOCs—showing that the two SME LOCs contributed to the creation of an estimated 9,300 jobs and
the exports of ﬁrms beneﬁtting from the second export ﬁnance intermediary LOC (EFIL II) increased by
117 percent during the CPS period. The SME LOCs included a requirement that on average 25 percent of
disbursed funds be provided to underserved regions. IFC support included an emphasis on short-term trade
ﬁnance and debt roll-overs, risk diversiﬁcation through exports, microenterprise and SME ﬁnancing through
portfolio ﬁnancial institutions and private equity investments, and the mobilization of long-term funds from
other ﬁnancial institutions (USD 1.73 billion). IFC’s client banks provide more than USD 10 billion in loans to
MSMEs and its portfolio companies have 68,000 employees, including 16,000 women.
17.
The investment climate, export competitiveness, technology use and innovation are improving
slowly; further advances are a priority. The CPS program included a substantial of analytic and advisory
services as well as policy based ﬁnancing in support of business and investment climate reforms—including
investment climate assessments, Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS), a study of SME
development, and ﬁnancing under the Second Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy Loan
(CEDPL) and the Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development Policy Loan (REGE DPL)
series. The program helped sustain the momentum of investment climate reforms through the global crisis.
Signiﬁcant progress has been made, including the adoption of major reforms, such as the Commercial Code
and the Monitoring and Supervision of State Aids Law, supported by the WBG. However, the achievement
of milestones has been slow. The ﬁnal draft of a new Public Private Partnership Law (PPP) was prepared in
2010 (in the meantime BOT Law no: 3996 was amended in 2011 and the secondary legislation was revised
accordingly to move forward with the BOT highway projects), enforcement of the new Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR) legislation has still to be fully raised to EU standards and the Commercial Code will take time to
become effective and be implemented. Preparation for a new capital markets law is ongoing. IBRD and IFC
are working together in providing ongoing support to the Capital Markets Board on the development of a
corporate bond market. In the meantime, IFC ﬁnancing has helped strengthen Turkish ﬁrms’ competitiveness
with new technology (e.g. energy efﬁciency and cleaner production) and on supporting Turkish companies’
regional and international expansion (15 projects in the Balkans, Russia, Georgia, Haiti, Tunisia, Egypt, and
Argentina with over USD 350 million in ﬁnancing). MIGA worked extensively on this issue. In Turkey 5 projects
(4 infrastructure and 1 ﬁnance) 38 were carried out, with a total of USD 1.02 billion in gross exposure. The ﬁrst
underground metro system on the Asian side of Istanbul was supported by MIGA’s new guarantee product.
MIGA added 1 guarantee supporting an investment sponsored by a Turkish investor in a manufacturing
project in Iraq, bringing the total gross exposure of MIGA guarantees to Turkish investments outside Turkey
to USD 29 million in 5 currently active projects.
Turkey’s low employment rate and high informality remain a challenge
18.
Turkey’s low employment rates and high informality made policies to enhance productive
employment a top priority. A series of analyses, most joint with government and other development partners,
and advisory work led to key policy recommendations on labour taxes, informal economy, female labour
force participation, and youth employment. IBRD ﬁnancing under the PPDPL-REGE DPL series supported
the ﬁrst stage of Turkey’s labour market reform in 2008, which was focused on reducing non-wage labour
costs and improving skills. Technical assistance supported the preparation of a crisis-response employment
package; the expansion and improvement of Active Labor Market Policies (ALMP);39 and the development of
the upcoming National Employment Strategy.

Energy supply is more reliable and more efﬁcient
19.
Turkey has an impressive track record in implementing reforms and improving energy security.
During the CPS period, Turkey updated its energy strategy; and introduced and implemented cost recovery
pricing. IBRD’s ﬁnancing and knowledge activities supported tariff reform, privatization, energy market
liberalization and regulation, power generation rehabilitation and transmission investments, and the
strengthening of Turkey’s Electricity Transmission Corporation (TEIAS). IFC invested around USD 2.2 billion
(USD 560 million of its own ﬁnancing and over USD 1.6 billion through mobilization) in 5 power sector
projects. The power sector represented the majority of IFC investments in infrastructure, with syndication an
important component of IFC ﬁnancing. IFC investments focused on supply security through private sector
participation in power distribution, including one of Turkey’s ﬁrst two privatized distribution companies40,
and new generation capacity projects, particularly clean energy projects41.
20.
Increasing renewable energy use and energy efﬁciency is vital for Turkey. Renewable energy and
energy efﬁciency investments increase energy supply security; help contain energy imports and thus the
current account deﬁcit; create jobs; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change.
In short, they are a “quadruple win.” The Turkey-WBG partnership has included a major focus on promoting
renewable energy use and energy, and during the CPS period Turkey established a clear legislative-regulatory
framework for renewable energy, implemented energy efﬁciency legislation, and included renewable energy
and energy efﬁciency as key components in its new National Climate Change Strategy. As a result, Turkey
was able to attract substantial private investment for the development of renewable energy, especially
wind and small hydropower stations. Extensive IBRD knowledge services and the PEDPL-ESES DPL series
supported the new legislation and reforms. WBG ﬁnancing included IBRD credit lines, intermediated through
local institutions, for renewable energy and energy efﬁciency investments,42 especially in wind power and
small-scale hydropower plants. IBRD and IFC partnered with the Clean Technology Fund (CTF). IFC also
undertook the ﬁrst limited recourse wind farm ﬁnancing, laid the groundwork for private investment in
new technologies like solar technology, facilitated JVs between international players and local partners, and
in March 2011 published ‘Sustainable Investment in Turkey’, as a part of IFC’s broader efforts to promote
sustainable investment.
21.
Addressing climate change is becoming a priority. Turkey became a party to the Kyoto protocol on
August 26th 2009, and the Government and the WBG have become partners in Turkey’s efforts to mitigate
and adapt to climate change. As the energy sector accounts for more than 70 percent of Turkey’s greenhouse
gas emissions, climate change mitigation is closely tied to “green and clean” energy investments and reforms.
This link is reﬂected in Turkey’s new National Climate Change Strategy and forthcoming National Climate
Change Action Plan. The World Bank has supported the National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan
with advisory services and through the Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector (ESES) DPL II. IFC
supported its client companies to invest in new technologies with a focus on energy efﬁciency and cleaner
production. Also, IFC’s investments in the energy sector were focused on renewable energy projects43. As
Turkey is expected to be among the countries most affected by climate change in the Europe and Central Asia
region, climate change adaptation will continue growing in importance over the medium term.

Awarded “Best Power Deal in CEE” by EMEA Finance
Enerjisa was selected as 2008 “European Portfolio Power Deal of the Year” by Project Finance Euromoney Magazine, as well as “Best EMEA
power Deal for 2008” by EMEA Finance Magazine.
42 IBRD Credit Lines in this CPS were as follows: Fourth Export Finance Intermediary Loan (EFIL IV), 2008; Access to Finance for SMEs –
Additional Financing, 2009 ; Private Sector Renewable Energy & Energy Efﬁciency, 2009; Access to Finance for SMEs – Second Additional
Financing, 2010; Access to Finance for SME II, 2010; & Fourth Export Finance Intermediary Loan (EFIL IV) Additional Financing, 2011.
43 The Enerjisa project alone is expected to generate over 20,000 MWh of clean energy, representing nearly 10 percent of Turkey’s electricity needs,
and to reduce anticipated CO2 emissions by 1.15 million tons per year by 2014.

Annex 3

Pillar 2: Equitable Human and Social Development
Social security has been strengthened and become more equitable
22.
Turkey’s health and social security reform (the Social Insurance and Universal Health Insurance
Law was enacted in 2006, amended in 2008 and most provisions of the Law took effect by October 1, 2008)
established universal health insurance, increased coverage for the poor, and fundamentally reformed the
pension system. The Green Card system, established in 1992, provides free access to medical care for those
who earn less than a certain minimum (deﬁned by law) and are not covered by public insurance. The Green
Card program grew from 6.852 million beneﬁciaries in 2004 to 9.4 million in 2010 which, along with the
introduction of universal health insurance, have signiﬁcantly increased the share of the population covered
by some form of health insurance (an increase from 86 percent in 2005 to 96.2 percent in 2010). All Green Card
holders are expected to be covered by 2012 according to the Law No: 5510 Provisional Article 12. The health
and social security reform also put the pension system on a path toward long-term ﬁscal sustainability and
improved its equity, by better aligning the pensions of civil servants, workers and the self-employed.
23.
Some initial steps were taken to integrate social assistance programs. While social assistance
spending increased rapidly, it accounted for only 1.2 percent of GDP in 2009. A new ministry called the
Ministry of Family and Social Policies was created after the June 2011 elections, bringing all social beneﬁts
under a single roof. An integrated social assistance information system has been developed and is already
operational.
24.
The WBG has been a close partner with Turkey in supporting social security reform and in efforts
to improve equity and inclusion. The PPDPL and REGE DPL series and parallel policy dialogue, analyses,
and advisory services supported the social security and universal health insurance reform, the accompanying
administrative reform to unify existing social security schemes under the Social Security Institution (SSI), and
crisis response measures. The Second Privatization Social Support Project (PSSP2) assisted the privatization
program by mitigating the negative social and economic impacts of the privatization of State-Owned
Enterprises (SOEs). Analytical studies, technical assistance and close policy dialogue included assessments
of the welfare impact of the economic slowdown, labour force activation policies, pensions’ and the Green
Card program.
25.
Two major studies, on female labour force participation (joint with the Government) and on
equality of opportunity, broke new ground on key social policy issues in Turkey, providing new analysis,
advancing public debate, and helping inform policy. The female labor force participation study found that
an increase in female employment to 29 percent (the target rate in Turkey’s 9th Development Plan), with new
entrants assuming full-time jobs, could reduce the poverty rate to 15.5 percent. The equality of opportunity
study found large demographic disparities in opportunity among children from early ages and made the case
for early childhood development as an effective means to promote equal opportunities, strengthen growth,
and reduce poverty. The studies’ ﬁndings were taken up in a joint WBG/United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) conference on Early Childhood Development (ECD). A roundtable on Early Childhood Education
(ECE) and a study exploring the expansion of the provision of high quality ECE followed—in partnership
with UNICEF and in support of the Government’s priority program to roll out universal pre-school education.
Turkey’s health system has become more effective
26.
Turkey’s Health Transformation Program (HTP) has improved healthcare. It increased access,
ﬁnancial protection, service coverage and patient satisfaction. The roll-out of Family Medicine as part of the
HTP, completed in December 2010, improved patient satisfaction and access to health services across the
country. Average patient satisfaction in family medicine provinces rose from 69 percent in 2004 to 86 percent
in 2008.

Annex 3

56

27.
WBG support for the strong implementation of the HTP complemented the support for the
introduction of universal health insurance, improvements in health system performance, and ﬁscal
sustainability under the PPDPL-REGE DPL series. IBRD support for the HTP focused on increasing
health insurance coverage, expanding and improving family medicine, improving hospital autonomy, and
strengthening performance management. It included two Adaptable Program Loans—the Health Transition
Project and the Health Transformation and Social Security Reform Project—and accompanying advisory
services and technical assistance. A 2008 study jointly prepared with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) assessed health system performance and provided the analytical
foundation for deepening reforms. The World Bank Institute (WBI) engaged policy makers and stakeholders
on health sector reform and sustainable ﬁnancing. IFC supported private sector participation with two
investments totalling USD 50 million. Through a loan to a leading leasing company in Turkey, IFC supported
550 SME healthcare projects. Additionally, through equity investments in a distressed but signiﬁcant
healthcare provider, IFC enabled improved access to high quality private healthcare services at affordable
prices, including frontier and underserved regions.
The education system is expanding, reforming, and increasing its sensitivity to labor demand
28.
Education reforms led to improvements in school access and educational achievements. Primary
education is now nearly universal (98 percent in 2010-2011). Secondary education enrolment and completion
rates increased signiﬁcantly during the CPS period: enrolments increased from 57 percent in 2006-2007 to 69
percent in 2010-2011, and completion rose from 45 percent to 51 percent in the same period44. Pre-primary
education enrolments are increasing rapidly, as the Government is rolling out its program to implement
universal pre-school enrolment of 5 year olds by 2014. Regional and gender disparities remain signiﬁcant. For
example, 2010-2011 preschool enrolments varied between 13 percent in Hakkarı and 59 percent in Amasya,
and girls’ secondary school enrolments remain six percentage points below boys’ (66 versus 72 percent).
Turkey’s results in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which assesses the educational
attainment of 15-year olds, improved signiﬁcantly in the 2009 round compared with the 2006 round, partly
due to the new primary education curriculum. However, the average 15 year old remains about one full
school year behind the average OECD student.
29.
Turkey’s partnership with the WBG in education focused on improvements in quality and equity.
The IBRD supported Secondary Education Project (SEP) included the development of a new secondary school
curriculum and a national career guidance and counselling system to improve the quality and relevance
of secondary education—along with the development of a national qualiﬁcations framework for vocational
education and training, and enhanced in-service teacher training. To improve the quality of disadvantaged
schools, the SEP introduced school grants and piloted a different way of ﬁnancing schools: funds are distributed
in proportion to the number of students, and schools have autonomy in the allocation of funds. Analytic
and advisory services included studies on the quality and equity of basic education and early childhood
education.
Pillar 3: Efﬁcient Provision of High Quality Public Services
Public expenditure management system has improved; Public sector governance was strengthened
30.
Turkey’s public sector increased in breadth, transparency, accountability and credibility,
according to the Public Financial Management Performance (PFMP) benchmarking in June 2010. Turkey
has reformed many central government institutions, systems and laws governing public sector transparency
and performance. The implementation of the 2006 Public Financial Management and Control (PFMC)
Law throughout the CPS period effectively delegated ﬁnancial control and internal audit to line agencies.
44 Here the secondary completion rate is deﬁned as the proportion of 20-24 year olds who have completed at least secondary education, data taken
from Labor Force Survey.

Annex 3

57

Accordingly, ﬁnancial controls and internal and external audit structures have signiﬁcantly improved. The
enactment of the Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA) Law in December 2010 broadened the mandate of the TCA
to audit the entire general government and aligned its structure with the PFMC Law.
31.
The Turkey-WBG partnership on public sector reform included both analytic and advisory
services and ﬁnancing. Programmatic public expenditure and public ﬁnancial management analytic work
and technical assistance, jointly implemented with the Government and also with Parliament, and ﬁnancial
support under the PPDPL-REGE DPL series were closely integrated with the National Development Plan.
Their programmatic design proved effective in the support of complex public sector legal and institutional
reforms, which often require a number of years to fully implement and deliver. Two examples are the
establishment of strategy development units for ﬁnancial control and internal audit in all general government
institutions, and the development of speciﬁc codes to allow the Ministries of Finance and Health to track
program expenditures under the HTP. The TCDD Railway Restructuring Project met its development
objectives, as operating revenues and the ratio of operating revenues to expenses rose toward commercially
viable levels. TCDD’s legal status is unchanged, although a draft law is under preparation.
32.
Progress on the judicial aspects of governance has been slower. A new Civil Procedure Code
was enacted in February 2011 and the Government plans to resubmit a draft mediation law to the Judicial
Commission of the Grand National Assembly. The judicial network project (UYAP) established online
connections in 100 percent of courts. The Judicial Reform Strategy and Action Plan was endorsed and
published in 2009. Regional Courts of Appeal have been established in 15 centers (Istanbul, Bursa, İzmir,
Ankara, Konya, Samsun, Adana, Erzurum, Diyarbakır, Sakarya, Gaziantep, Antalya, Kayseri, Trabzon and
Van) but are not yet operational. However chief public prosecutors of all these courts have been appointed by
High Council for Judges and Prosecutors. The efﬁciency of judicial processes has been reforming slowly, and
Turkey’s demand for World Bank contributions was limited.
Local service delivery and disaster preparedness have improved
33.
Municipal reform has moved forward. Total budgetary transfers to local administrations as a share
of tax revenues increased from 9 percent in 2007 to 10 percent in 2010 (including BELDES and KOYDES
programs that support development at local level, the budgetary transfer to local administrations increased
from 10 percent to 11 percent during the same period). The Law on Iller Bankası A.Ş., enacted in 2011, was
critical for municipal infrastructure ﬁnancing and effective local ﬁnancial management systems. Progress
was made on cadastre modernisation. Cadastre and Registration Agency has started working on property
valuation policy in-line with international practices and standards, and 24 institutions now have on-line
access to digital cadastre information, exceeding the target of 18. Successful IBRD support for municipal
infrastructure investments, through Iller Bank, led to additional ﬁnancing in 2010 to scale up results. IFC’s
investment in the Istanbul Metro was the ﬁrst WBG ﬁnancing in Turkey at a sub-national level without a
sovereign guarantee and has become a ﬂagship project for private sector participation in the urban sector. It
is considered a major step towards greater ﬁnancial strength and independence for municipal governments
in Turkey. Beyond the original CPS objectives, Turkey and the WBG started work on ‘Sustainable Cities’, and
Turkey launched a new Integrated Urban Development Strategy and Action Plan (2010-2023)—envisaging a
comprehensive approach to city development, including spatial planning and infrastructure prioritization.
34.
Istanbul’s improvements in disaster preparedness are an international success story. Investments
have been made in seismic strengthening for public buildings, especially schools, hospitals and dormitories.
Of 1,576 public facilities identiﬁed, 496 had been completed by February 2011 through combined World
Bank, EIB and CEB ﬁnancing. The Istanbul Seismic Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness (ISMEP) Project
includes collaboration with the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Response and the World Bank
Institute (WBI). A national-level Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency was created in the Prime
Ministry, unifying previously fragmented institutional responsibilities.

Annex 3

58

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
Country Partnership Design
35.
The CPS was designed to be based on, fully aligned with, and adaptable to changes in Turkey’s
evolving development priorities. The ﬂexible CPS design was tested and proved successful during the global
ﬁnancial crisis, as the strategy was adjusted at the mid-term progress review (CPSPR). DPL support expanded
and focused on macroeconomic stability and medium-term structural reforms to support economic growth
and job creation (REGE DPL series)45. In response to client demand, IBRD increased total ﬁnancing over the
CPS period was USD 7.6 billion, with USD 3 billion committed in FY10. In parallel, in view of global credit
restrictions, IFC focused on client companies rolling-over short-term debt, provided much needed short-term
ﬁnance such as trade ﬁnance, and mobilized long-term funds from other ﬁnancial institutions (USD 1.73
billion).
36.
The CPS was designed to support Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan, with advisory services geared
to inform and support national policies and WBG ﬁnancing contributing to large nation-wide programs
and selected speciﬁc projects. Combined ﬁnancing and knowledge services enabled support to be delivered
in a targeted, effective and timely manner. The extensive use of programmatic AAA and DPLs allowed IBRD
to provide customized and consistent yet ﬂexible support for broad development goals and programs over
several years. The large volume of LOCs (6 WBG operations, including 3 Additional Financings, totalling
USD 2.35 billion) is a distinct feature of the CPS program, facilitating the wide reach and rapid disbursement
of WBG project ﬁnancing.46 These design choices reﬂect country demand and a shared assessment by Turkey
and the WBG of the areas of maximum WBG “value-added.” Naturally, the Turkey-WBG partnership covers
only a small part of Turkey’s development program, and WBG ﬁnancing accounts for only a small fraction
of Turkey’s total external ﬁnancing47. The WBG’s contribution has thus been mainly catalytic, with direct
attribution being challenging if not often impossible, and with Turkey’s continued high demand for WBG
services providing an imperfect, indirect indicator of their value added. Demand for IBRD services continues
to exceed the already high levels of new ﬁnancing and knowledge services IBRD is able to provide, given
ﬁnancial risk management considerations and budget limitations.
37.
In general, the CPS results framework was a useful structure for measuring progress and
performance. Milestones in the results framework were largely met. A review of results against targets
must take into account that some original milestones and targets became less relevant as the crisis changed
country and program priorities. Thus, the CPS goal of enhancing the educational system and increasing the
sensitivity of education to labour demand (Pillar 2C) is assessed to have been substantively achieved, albeit
in a very narrow sense. Similarly, progress has been made towards the goal of increased private investment,
improved export competitiveness, and a deeper and broader ﬁnancial sector (Pillar 1B), but major legislation
to modernize the investment climate was passed only in late 2010 and in early 2011. As there is neither new
Public Private Partnership (PPP) nor bankruptcy legislation, the achievement of milestones was slower than
anticipated, and the overall goals in this pillar are assessed to have been partially achieved. At the same time,
WBG support has contributed to the achievement of additional outcomes, beyond those originally envisaged
in the CPS. These are outlined above.
45 REGE-DPL focused on the transition from managing the impact of the global crisis to ﬁscal consolidation and shared growth and contributed
to the following objectives: (1) economic management; (2) public ﬁnancial management; (3) affordable universal healthcare and improved
educational access; (4) employment; (5) improved investment climate; and (6) increased ﬁnancial intermediation, especially to SMEs.
46 The WBG’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rated the outcomes of two export ﬁnance loans (EFIL II & III) as highly satisfactory.
47 The scale of WBG ﬁnancing, averaging USD 1.9 billion in new commitments and USD 1.71 billion in disbursements during FY08-11, was very
small when compared with Turkey’s total public debt, which was USD 321,4 billion in 2010, and it amounted to 23 percent of Turkey’s average
public external borrowing (USD 8.43 billion between 2007-2010) and less than 1 percent of its average total gross external debt per year [USD 266
billion] between 2007-2009.

Annex 3

59

CPS Implementation
38.
IBRD’s portfolio is large, focused and considerably improved. Disbursement rates steadily increased,
rising from 20 percent in FY08 to 31 percent in 2011. With a realism rate of 94 percent, which stood at virtually
100 percent over the majority of the CPS period, and proactive portfolio management (67 percent), only one
problem project remained at end FY11 (compared to 3 at end-FY10 and 4 in mid-FY11). The one problem
project was the Istanbul Municipal Infrastructure Project (Loan No. 4866-TU), which was cancelled at the
borrower’s request in July 2011.
39.
IFC ﬁnancing during FY08-11 was spread across 45 projects with USD 2 billion in commitments,
compared to USD 1.55 billion over 35 projects during FY04-07. IFC also mobilized USD 1.73 billion through
private ﬁnancial institutions to assist the private sector. Targeted areas included exporters, MSMEs, renewable
energy, energy efﬁciency, cleaner production and energy security, health, infrastructure, trade ﬁnance and
support for Turkish companies investing in the region and beyond.
40.
Implementation of an extensive program of analytic and advisory (AAA) services, focused on
Turkey’s key policy and reform priorities, was central to the success of the CPS. IBRD’s AAA program
featured 52 major knowledge products, many prepared jointly with the Government and in collaboration
with academia, UN institutions, and other development partners. Topics ranged from public ﬁnancial
management, informality, and savings to energy sector reform and regulation, food safety, and watershed
management, to education quality, female employment and gender certiﬁcation, and the (in)equality of
opportunities, to the investment climate, competition and business regulation, and corporate bond market
development. The program also included focused “just in time” analyses of draft legislation and reform
options and policy notes for the incoming Governments in August 2007 and June 2011. Turkish counterparts’
persistent strong demand for these knowledge services is testimony to their value-added, which is rooted
in their demand driven selection and design, their collaborative preparation, the extensive engagement on
ﬁndings and conclusions with a broad range of stakeholders, and the increasing use of results frameworks for
knowledge activities.
41.
Good relations with civil society. Civil society participated in the preparation and implementation of
projects, including HTP and ISMEP. The WBG works with academia, think tanks, private sector associations
and businesses, as well as a wide range of non-governmental organizations including TUSIAD (Turkish
Industry and Business Association) and KAGIDER (Women Entrepreneur’s Association of Turkey). The WBG
played a convening role: working with Parliament; supporting the World Water Forum; and holding its 2009
Annual Meetings in Istanbul. A speciﬁc example of the WBG’s convening power is the human development
policy dialogue carried out jointly with the Middle East Technical University, Ankara University, Sabanci
University, and UNDP. In preparing this CPSCR, the WBG met with civil society organizations to gauge
opinions of work carried out during the CPS period and seek inputs to the report.
42.
Strong partnership with development partners. The WBG works closely with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) on macroeconomic issues, sharing expertise on pension, energy sector, and a broad
range of other structural issues. It maintains a close relationship with the EU, UNDP and UNICEF in Ankara.
Of particular note was the success of the WBG private sector team (ECSPF) in mobilizing £100,000 from the
UK Foreign and Commonwealth Ofﬁce to fund a pilot project to simplify administrative procedures, a ﬁrst
for the WBG in Turkey. IFC increased its cooperation with other IFIs in Turkey. Work included a country
engagement plan with EBRD on the Clean Technology Fund; syndicating a ﬁrst loan with Black Sea Trade
and Development Bank, based on IFC’s Master Cooperation Agreement; coordinating with FMO to jointly
sign a subordinated loan to a client bank; and cooperation in two projects with KfW on energy efﬁciency and
MSME ﬁnancing.

60

Annex 3

43.
The 2011 Country Survey presented a broad range of opinions of the work of the WBG. With a
32 percent response rate, respondents identiﬁed education (skills), environment and natural resource
management, employment, energy, and disaster preparedness as key development priorities for the WBG’s
partnership with Turkey. This choice is broadly consistent with the CPS and the analysis in this CPSCR. Sector
priorities were as follows: rural development, increased job opportunities in the formal sector, enhancing
opportunities for private sector growth/investment, access to pre-school education, and macroeconomic
growth. With the exception of rural development, these largely mirror work carried out in this CPS. Less
positively, respondents noted the slowness and complexity of processes as the WBG’s greatest weaknesses
in Turkey and identiﬁed interaction with stakeholders outside Government as a key area for improvement.
Respondents also perceived WBG work as not being particularly effective in reducing poverty.
V. KEY LESSONS LEARNED & RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MOVING FORWARD
44.
The systematic development and maintenance of a policy dialogue in support of long-term
strategic goals, combining knowledge and lending operations, is vital to support reforms. Major policy
and legislative reforms can take time to implement; therefore ﬂexibility and patience are critical for ensuring
success. Successful collaboration on the Commercial Code (seven years in preparation) is an example of the
value of long-term engagement. To increase success, the full integration of combined analytic work and policy
ﬁnancing into national development plans and medium-term programs is critical. Programmatic structuring
of work, in the form of modular interventions which build on each other sequentially, was particularly
effective.
45.
The story of engagement on environment and climate change: step back, identify strategic entry
points and seize opportunities that open as country priorities evolve. Turkey and the WBG agreed not to use
environment as a pillar in CPS FY08-11, reﬂecting limited advancement of the environmental agenda during
2004-2007 and a decision to consider jointly a possible re-engagement, at Turkey’s initiative, later during the
2008-11 CPS period. Turkey’s accession to the Kyoto protocol and the opening of the Environmental Chapter
of the EU Acquis in 2009 then provided the opportunity and strategic entry point for a new engagement
on environment and climate change. The new engagement grew out of the Turkey-WBG partnership on
energy. The electricity DPL series was broadened into the ESES DPL series, with three components: energy,
climate change and environmental sustainability. This work led to collaboration in preparation for the 2012
UN Sustainable Development Conference (Rio+20). IFC used its support for Turkey’s liberalization program
to secure low carbon solutions to meet growing electricity demand.
46.
A strengthened focus on M&E and results has been welcome and useful. Turkey and the WBG
have collaborated in strengthening monitoring and evaluation and the results focus of government and WBG
supported programs - through the rolling programmatic JPPR, technical assistance on M&E ﬁnanced by the
IDF and many other task speciﬁc M&E activities. A special effort was made to include results frameworks in
all AAA activities. One joint example of M&E and a strong results focus is the work on vocational training
with ISKUR.
47.
Sharing success. A number of Turkey’s policies and reforms, conducted in partnership with the WBG,
are leading examples of work in their ﬁelds. These include: (1) the Health Transformation Program; (2) energy
market development, and (3) disaster risk management. This experience provides a basis for further TurkeyWBG collaboration during the next, FY12-15, CPS in knowledge sharing and contributing to development
with other countries, regionally and globally.

(no consideration of possible WBG contribution)

1A. Sustained Macroeconomic Stability and Sustained Economic Growth

Pillar 1: Competitiveness and Employment Opportunities

A cross-cutting ﬁnding from the implementation of the FY08-11 CPS is that Turkey has achieved international good practice results in key areas of the Turkey-WBG partnership, with WBG
support. Examples include: (1) the Health Transformation Program; (2) energy market development, and (3) disaster risk management. This experience provides a basis for further Turkey-WBG
collaboration during the next, FY12-15, CPS in knowledge sharing and contributing to development with other countries, regionally and globally.

± Leasing, factoring and consumer ﬁnance assets increased from TL 19.7 billion in 2006 to TL
36.4 billion in 2010. Insurance sector assets increased from TL 17 billion in 2006 to 36.6 billion
by the end of March 2011.

Expand the scope of ﬁnancial services in Turkey by developing non-bank ﬁnance as measured
by NBFI assets (leasing assets, and insurance ﬁrm assets/total ﬁnancial sector assets).

± 2010: Share of total credit in GDP was 48 percent. Note: TUIK now calculates GDP rather
than GNP.

Increase private sector access to ﬁnance in Turkey by strengthening credit markets. Target:
Expand the share of total credit in GNP from 31.7 percent in 2006 to around 35 percent by 2011.

Development of Intellectual Property Rights legislation aligned with the EU Acquis.
± Partially Achieved: The legal framework is in place but enforcement needs to be raised to
EU standards, particularly in the area of Industrial Property rights. Key legal enforcement
institutions and the Patent Institute need capacity strengthening. Measures to improve
government-private cooperation and the commercialization of research are still needed.
Implementation of investment climate reforms to facilitate entry and exit and remove obstacles to
the growth of surviving entrants, such as a) bankruptcy reform including legislation; b) approving
state aid legislation in conformity with EU and c) facilitating enterprise formalization by easing
doing business.
± Partially Achieved: Monitoring and Supervision of State Aids Law was approved in early
2011. Government working jointly with the Bank on a TA program to develop regulatory
reform strategy to reduce “time tax.” Ministry of Justice has prepared draft amendments to
bankruptcy legislation to address some of the existing shortcomings, but there is no timetable
for their approval yet.

National Key Outcomes & Indicators inﬂuenced by the CPS

Labor market relevant policies informed by Bank supported AAA.
± Achieved: Analytic studies have covered labor taxes, informal economy, female labor force
participation, and youth employment. The programmatic HD TA has provided advice on
ALMP, labor market regulations, employment-related crisis measures and capacity building on
impact evaluation. The ﬁndings and policy options in this work have helped inform policy
discussions among government and non-government stakeholders.
Implementation of measures to reduce labor costs as well as increase labor market ﬂexibility
and worker protection
± Partially Achieved: First-stage labor market reforms reduced non-wage labor costs and
non-ﬁnancial costs of employment for employers (e.g. those imposed by profession-speciﬁc
employment quotas and similar legal constraints has been partially achieved) and allowed for
the expansion of ALMP. Second-stage labor market reforms (to address issues of short-term
and part-time employment, unemployment insurance, severance pay, etc.) are pending, and a
comprehensive employment strategy including those reforms is in the making.
± Beyond CPS Achievements: Government responded to the economic slowdown with several
employment packages, including the expansion of vocational training (from 30,000 beneﬁciaries
in 2008 to around 210,000 in 2010) public works and wage subsidies. Continued expansion
and quality improvement of ALMP after the crisis (the Government expects 400,000 ALMP
beneﬁciaries in 2011, up from around 33,000 in 2007; introduction of quality assessment of
vocational training providers). IBRD supported these programs.

1C: Increased Employment

Increased Employment:
•
Passage of labor market reform law that increases labor market ﬂexibility and improves
the effective protection of workers.
± In 2010 and 2011 the government continued to expand Active Labor Market Policies and
introduced reforms to improve the quality and relevance of vocational training. The so-called
“Omnibus Law” of February 2011included some changes related to ﬂexible contracting
and the extension of the targeted subsidies to new hires. A comprehensive employment
strategy, including reforms to increase labor market ﬂexibility and worker protection, has
been prepared.

Achieved full pass-through of costs to electricity tariffs. Baseline - proportion of electricity costs
passed through to consumers: 91 percent in 2006.
± Since 2008 100 percent of costs have been passed through.

Reduced distribution system technical losses from 15.1 percent in 2006.
± Distribution losses were reduced to 14.4 percent in 2008 then rose to 18.6 percent in 2010. This
ﬁgure is higher than the original ﬁgure because the remaining (not privatized) distribution
companies are those with high loss & theft ratios.

Increased private sector participation in power distribution and generation. Baseline: 3 percent
of the market served by distribution companies and 55 percent of generation output was private
as of 2006.
± In 2010, electricity served by private distribution companies raised to approximately 44
percent of the market and 55 percent of output came from private generators.

•

•

•

Supply security measures informed by analytic work and energy program ﬁnancing: e.g.,
improving supply and demand side energy efﬁciency; increasing renewable energy generation;
introducing capacity mechanisms during CPS period.
± Achieved: Government has been informed effectively by analytic work and energy program
ﬁnancing focusing on increasing renewable energy generation and supporting energy efﬁciency
investments.
Improve operational effectiveness of the Turkish electricity market and power systems, informed
by advisory services on market functioning and rehabilitation of generation, transmission, and
distribution networks, as measured by the approval of ﬁnal market rules and their subsequent
implementation during CPS period.
± Partially achieved: Improved operational effectiveness is anticipated, informed by delivered
and ongoing advisory services. Market rules have been approved by EMRA. Day-ahead market
has already been tested, and is planned to be launched in on December 1st 2011.
Implementation of the energy efﬁciency law commenced.
± Achieved: Implementation has started, wide-ranging regulations approved. Informed by
advisory services, main regulatory body, EIE’s mandate on EE is being strengthened and its
capacity is being strengthened. Bank investment loan is supporting EE in key industrial sectors.

Pillar 2: Equitable Human and Social Development

Equity of pension system improves: pension parameters are uniﬁed for workers, self-employed
and new civil servants.
± Fully implemented.

Effective ﬁnancial protection of the poor in health: a new targeting system (such as proxy means
testing) is introduced for non-contributory health insurance, is implemented, and reaches at
least 50 percent of the vulnerable population in 2011.
± Technical discussions on targeting options have begun. According to Law No 5510 all green
card owners will be covered by the universal health insurance system by 2012 and their
premiums will be paid by the government.

A coordinated social assistance system under clear management authority with adequate
budgetary ﬁnancing has been established.
± A new ministry of Ministry of Family and Social Policies was created, bringing all social
beneﬁts under a single roof.

•

•

•

Increased coverage of health insurance among vulnerable groups.
± Achieved. As a result of the expansion in obligatory insurance schemes as well as the green
card program coverage among the poor, the percentage of population covered by some form of
health insurance has increased from 86 percent in 2005 to 96.2 percent in 2010.

•

Effective proxy means testing system for green card holders developed and implemented.
± Partially Achieved. Although a proxy means test was not introduced during the CPS period,
from January 2012 the identiﬁcation of beneﬁciaries of non-contributory health insurance will
be done using the proxy-means test developed by the new Ministry of Family and Social Policies
through the ISAIS. The Green card program is well targeted to the poor: 71 percent of Green
Card beneﬁciaries are in the poorest 25 percent of the population and administrative controls
have been established to discontinue beneﬁts among non-eligible households.

Enactment of social assistance law creating a coordinated social assistance system.
± Partially Achieved: A social assistance law creating a coordinated social assistance system
has not been enacted, but two signiﬁcant steps to develop an integrated social assistance
system have been taken: (i) all beneﬁts are now managed under one roof in the newly created
Ministry of Family and Social Policies, and (ii) an Integrated Social Assistance Information
System (ISAIS) has been developed and is already operational.

Annex 3

Lessons Learnt and Suggestions for Next CPS:
The story of engagement on environment and climate change: step back, identify strategic entry points and seize opportunities that open as country priorities evolve. Turkey and the WBG
agreed not to use environment as a pillar in CPS FY08-11, reﬂecting limited advancement of the environmental agenda during 2004-2007 and a decision to consider jointly a possible re-engagement,
at Turkey’s initiative, later during the 2008-11 CPS period. Turkey’s accession to the Kyoto protocol and the opening of the Environmental Chapter of the EU Acquis in 2009 then provided the
opportunity and strategic entry point for a new engagement on environment and climate change. The new engagement grew out of the Turkey-WBG partnership on energy. The electricity DPL
series was broadened into the ESES DPL series, with three components: energy, climate change and environmental sustainability. This work led to collaboration in preparation for the 2012 UN
Sustainable Development Conference (Rio+20). IFC used its support for Turkey’s liberalization program to secure low carbon solutions to meet growing electricity demand.
