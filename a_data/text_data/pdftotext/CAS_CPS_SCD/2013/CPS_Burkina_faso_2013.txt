1. CAS
Country: Burkina Faso
CAS Year: FY 2009

CAS Period: FY10- FY12

CASCR Review Period: FY10 – FY12

Date of this review: 09/03/2013

2. Executive Summary
i.
This review examines the implementation of the FY10-FY12 Burkina Faso Country Assistance
Strategy, and assesses the CAS Completion Report. The CAS included activities by IDA and IFC.
MIGA did not approve new guarantees during the CAS period. The review covers the joint
program of IDA and IFC.
ii.
The WBG strategy was formulated to help the country implement the country’s Strategy for
Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development (SCADD). The SCADD priorities reflected a
continuation of the government strategic priorities up to that point. Although the CAS Results
Framework (FY10-12) formally preceded the SCADD, it fully reflects SCADD priorities because
they were prepared in parallel. The WBG strategy aimed at contributing in two areas: minimizing
economic vulnerability and promoting growth recovery through economic transformation, and
sharing growth through improved social service delivery. Improving governance and developing
capacity were crosscutting themes of the strategy.
iii.
IEG rates the overall outcome of the CAS as moderately satisfactory, concurring with the
CASCR. Both pillars contributed to highly relevant country development objectives. Progress was
made in the various areas of Bank intervention but few outcomes were fully achieved reflecting
slow implementation of a number of projects. Under pillar I, Bank Group support during this period
helped sustain performance in the cotton sector, although cotton companies still do not produce a
profit as envisaged. But the other outcomes under this pillar (on agriculture productivity, exports,
environment for private sector, and access to markets) were only partially achieved. Pillar II
focused on the right issues to help Burkina move towards achievement of the Millenium
Development Goals (MDGs). Interventions pursued complex and challenging institutional changes
for the provision of better public services and to improve the accountability of local officials
responsible for delivering those services. Bank Group support helped improve demand for quality
of social services and strengthen institutions for delivery of quality social services. Public resource
management also improved but at a fairly slow pace. The CAS “cross-cutting” issues of
governance and capacity improvements applied mostly to pillar II but the CASCR is silent on if
and how the objectives of the cross-cutting issues were achieved.
iv.

IEG rates IDA performance as moderately satisfactory, concurring with the CASCR. The CAS
design was aligned with country priorities and its activities were highly relevant to key sectors of
the development strategy, but the CAS results framework was aspirational rather than realistic
given Burkina Faso’s weak administrative capacities. Yet, the CAS by aiming high and being
flexible promoted progress in the country’s all-important productive, institutional, and social
dimensions. On the downside, the CAS was dispersed over too many areas and activities, and
this did not bode well for implementation. A significant number of planned loans and AAA activities
in the CAS were dropped and replaced by other interventions as the period unfolded and priorities
changed, but the CASCR does not provide a full rationale for the changes. The WBG’s
supervision and project implementation was hampered by poor monitoring and evaluation
frameworks, which combined with weak client administrative capacity to lead to significant delays

in the implementation of projects. A review of Implementation Status and Results assessments
shows slight concern for implementation risk, which is hardly mentioned. This invited an
unfortunate arms-length involvement by project teams that contributed to implementation delays
and to several missed outcomes. As a consequence, results suffered. At the same time, the Bank
appears to have coordinated well with development partners, particularly in the provision of
budget support. Moreover, during the CAS period it helped the government carry out a
Consultative Group Meeting with the aim of aligning ODA support to government priorities. IFC’s
strategy of concentrating on making mining sector investments and continuing advisory services
on improving business climate was relevant, considering importance of the mining sector for
Burkina Faso, its small scale economy, and the lack of suitable IFC clients for investments.
v.
The CASCR contains a number of well-deduced lessons, although they are presented in the
form of recommendations rather than lessons per se. Salient among these, given the importance
for Burkina Faso of regional activities, is the need for better management of regional projects
through improved internal Bank Group management coordination and incentives. IEG would add
that a flexible approach to a CAS—especially in this case, with no mid-term review and when so
much is being pursued through budget support, trust funds, and multi-donor efforts—can diminish
accountabilities for performance. Moreover, weak risk assessments at the level of interventions can
delay program implementation, lead to over-commitment of resources, and affect adversely the
timeliness of expected outcomes.

3. WBG Strategy Summary
Overview of CAS Relevance:
Country Context:
1.
Burkina Faso is an IDA-only, landlocked country with a mainly rural population and one of the
highest illiteracy rates in the world (over 70 percent). Its narrow productive base is concentrated in
gold and cotton, which exposes the country to the oscillation of their world prices. Real GDP growth
was in the 3-6 percent range in the three years prior to the CAS and during the CAS period growth
increased to the 4-8 percent range. A population growth rate of over 3 percent has kept per capita
income growth low. In recent years Burkina has benefited from an upward cycle in commodity prices,
especially for gold, and the value of exports more than tripled during the CAS period reflecting also a
substantial increase in the volume of gold exports. At the same time inflation was low reflecting a
relatively prudent fiscal policy and some price controls (for example on fuel prices). Burkina received
yearly ODA financing of over a billion USD on average in 2008-2010 of which IDA accounted for less
than 20 percent. The country—which remains close to the bottom of the Human Development
Index—made some progress towards meeting the MDGs but is not expected to achieve them by
2015. Political stability—a constant in the past three decades—has recently come under pressure.
2.
Burkina Faso released its Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development
2011-2015 in April 2009—during CAS preparation—focusing the government strategy on accelerating
growth, developing human capital and promoting social protection, and reinforcing governance.
These priorities reflected a continuation of the government strategic priorities up to that point.
Although the CAS Results Framework (FY10-12) formally precedes the SCADD, it fully reflects
SCADD priorities because they were prepared in parallel.
Objectives of the WBG Strategy:
3.
The WB strategy was formulated to help the country implement the SCADD. To do so, the
WBG strategy aimed at contributing in two areas: minimizing economic vulnerability and promoting
growth recovery through economic transformation, and sharing growth through improved social
service delivery. Improving governance and developing capacity were crosscutting themes of the
strategy.

Relevance of the WBG Strategy:
4.
Congruence with Country Context and Country program. The CAS focused on actions to
address the country’s constraints and pressing issues as diagnosed in the SCADD. The two
engagement areas spoke directly to priority areas in the SCADD and mapped well into key country
development goals. The outcomes sought are congruent with a country context that required
productive diversification, better international and regional connections, and an upgrade of services
aimed at developing human capital.
5.
Relevance of Design. The CAS design was aligned with country priorities and its activities
were highly relevant to key sectors of the development strategy, but the CAS results framework was
aspirational rather than realistic in light of Burkina Faso’s administrative capacities. This was not an
unreasonable way to proceed given the country’s urgent need to make progress from a low
development threshold, but the strategy would have benefited from a mid-term progress report to
adjust priorities in light of developments. Such mid-term appraisal never took place. The mid-term
appraisal would also have enhanced accountability for results under the CAS. A significant number of
planned loans and AAA activities in the CAS were dropped and replaced by other interventions as the
period unfolded and priorities changed, but the CASCR does not provide a full rationale for the
changes. The WB’s most timely and significant deployment of resources was through the budget
support provided by a series of annual Poverty Reduction Support Credit interventions. These
interventions aimed at providing support across the full spectrum of CAS outcomes, and the one-size
fits all approach may not have been the best way to ensure that specific objectives were met.
6.
Given the ambition of the strategy, the results expected went beyond the relatively short
period of the CAS (three years), and therefore neither the Bank nor the country appeared to be clearly
focused on meeting the targets during the CAS period. Most CAS period activities were initiated
before the CAS was prepared and approved, and will not be completed until after the CAS period is
completed. The CAS was designed with this ‘flexibility’ in mind but the results framework objectives
and outcomes were not articulated in the same manner.
7.
Strength of the Results Framework. The program’s results matrix lays out the objectives
and outcome indicators for the two strategic themes but does not contain a separate matrix for the
governance or capacity themes. This makes sense given that governance improvements are
embedded in the activities under the strategic themes, although it also makes for very difficult
monitoring and evaluation of interventions to reach the governance and capacity objectives. The CAS
includes actions by IFC in support the growth theme but these actions are not well integrated in the
results framework. Moreover, design of the framework was poor from the perspective of improving
governance or enhancing capacity. Therefore the aspirational nature of the framework conspired
against having the right incentives to achieve outcomes during the CAS period and be accountable
for results.
8.
Risk Identification and Mitigation. The CAS identified several risks: the effects of a
prolonged global recession on Burkina, vulnerability to weather shocks, internal political turmoil,
public sector capacity constraints, and concentrating multi-sector investments in selected growth
poles. Providing budget support through quick disbursing credits was the way the WB sought to
respond to the risks of a prolonged global recession. But Burkina Faso was only mildly affected by the
financial crisis due to weak external banking linkages, and the growth rate dropped slightly in 2009
and recovered promptly. For weather shocks the strategy envisaged ex-ante risk reduction (weatherbased insurance, land and water resource management, and early warning systems) and provision of
social safety nets for ex-post mitigation. As regards political turmoil, the CAS is grounded in a longer
term national vision and is unlikely to be affected by changes of government or policy. While this may
be true, it reaffirms the aspirational nature of the CAS by minimizing the potential risk for short term
implementation and hoping that policies will be eventually implemented although not under this CAS.
On public sector capacity constraints, the CAS invokes a consistent approach to capacity
development using the GovID filter. The CASCR does not report on how the filter was used and any
results that followed from its application. There is no mitigation for the risk of concentration on

CASCR Review

selected growth poles because the CAS indicates that this is a medium term endeavor (limited
prospects in the short-term).
9.
Relevance of IFC’s and MIGA’s Program. According to the CASCR, IFC and IDA
coordinated closely to identify support from improving the investment climate to supporting
development of financial, hospitality, infrastructure, agribusiness and mining projects. IFC’s main
focus on mining sector investments during CAS period was particularly relevant, considering the
difficulties that IFC faced to make investments in Burkina Faso. As one of the poorest economies in
the world, the country lacks medium and large-scale companies with international accounting and
other standards that IFC needs for its counterparts. The mining sector was also one of the few areas
of the economy where IFC could mitigate foreign currency risk. The CASCR concludes that greater
efforts are needed by the Bank to build synergy between IDA and IFC.
Overview of CAS/CPS Implementation:
Lending and Investments:
10.
At the time of the CAS, there were 15 IDA financed operations ongoing for $530 million.
There were also 3 relatively large separate ongoing regional operations for West Africa that had
components for Burkina Faso of over $76 million. The CAS included a proposal for 13 operations for
$555 million of which 10 operations were funded for an enhanced amount of $674 million. This
compares with an assumed IDA envelope in the CAS of $550 million. Among these operations the
largest were four annual Poverty Reduction Support Credits and the Bagre Growth Pole project for a
total of $520 million. In addition—and based on an enhanced IDA envelope for Burkina Faso—six
unplanned operations for $255 million were funded during the CAS period. Moreover, sixteen
operations for $113 million were financed with Trust Funds. Two of these TF operations for $80
million were Fast Track Grants for Basic Education.
11.
The number of projects at risk (13 percent in FY-10-FY11, 6 percent in FY12) compares well
with an average of 25-30 percent for Africa as a whole during the period. Of the ongoing operations,
two were rated moderately satisfactory according to the latest ISR, five were rated moderately
satisfactory, and six were rated satisfactory. With respect to the operations approved during the CAS
period, four are rated moderately satisfactory and three are rated satisfactory on meeting
development outcomes. All the CAS unplanned operations are rated satisfactory on development
outcomes, except for one not rated.
12.
At the end of CAS period, IFC’s outstanding portfolio consisted of 13 investments totaling
$64.6 million in mining, financial market, information technology, tourism, and retail service
development. During CAS period, IFC disbursed a total of $13.2 million equity investments in two
small mining companies which have gold mine projects at the exploration stage. IFC also supported
Burkina Faso with trade finance guarantees for $24.4 million. MIGA did not issue any new guarantee
during CAS period.
13.
IFC’s internal rating of a US dollar loan to a bank in Burkina Faso had mostly satisfactory
rating for development outcome since IFC’s involvements in both loan and technical assistance
facilitated the acquisition of the bank with improved credit risk management practices. But partially
unsatisfactory ratings were assigned to project business success, screening, and supervision. IFC
was not able to address a foreign exchange risk properly which led to an early prepayment within 18
months after disbursement of IFC loan.
14.
During the CAS period, MIGA had an outstanding guarantee of $2.86 million to the hotel
project. This was the South-South project since the hotel investor is from Mali. Prior to the CAS
period, MIGA made business development efforts by supporting a junior mining company through its
trust fund and helped improved security system and engagement with artisanal miners. CAS
envisaged a possible MIGA guarantee in the mining sector, but it did not do so because a large
international firm purchased the mining company.

Analytic and Advisory Activities and Services
15.
The CAS program was supported by a substantial number of planned AAA services and
technical assistance. But only four of the ten pieces of planned economic sector work in the CAS
were delivered to the client. One – a Health Sector Status Report- is still ongoing, and five were
dropped and replaced by five non-planned pieces of economic sector work, of which one is still to be
delivered outside the CAS timeframe. The CAS also included nine planned TA tasks to be delivered
to the client, but only one of these tasks was done. Instead, eight non-planned TA tasks were
delivered during the CAS period. It seems to be in keeping with the CAS flexibility approach that such
a large number of the planned activities were dropped.
16.
During the CAS period, IFC approved two new advisory service projects for $1.4 million. One
project was for promoting alternative dispute resolution practices, the first such project in subSaharan Africa, and another project was for improving regulatory environment for business licenses.
In addition to 4 projects approved prior to CAS period, IFC managed a total of six advisory services
projects for a total of $7.2 million during CAS period. Except for one advisory service project for
access to finance, all advisory service portfolio projects were for investment climate related projects.
Partnerships and Development Partner Coordination
17.
Burkina Faso is highly dependent on ODA to meet its development needs and close the
financing gap. The Bank provides about twenty percent of ODA on average so coordination with other
development partners, particularly the EU, France, and the African Development Bank, has been
essential to ensure aid effectiveness. During the CAS period the Bank helped the government carry
out a Consultative Group Meeting with the aim of aligning ODA to the government priorities and to the
emerging SCADD. A cornerstone of aid coordination in support of SCADD was the budget support
agreement with nine donors, an effort led by the government with WB assistance.
Safeguards and Fiduciary Issues
18.
The CAS completion report did not discuss safeguard or fiduciary issues. IEG is not aware of
safeguard or fiduciary issues in the WBG’s portfolio.
Overview of Achievement by Objective:
Pillar 1: Minimizing economic vulnerability and promoting growth recovery through economic
transformation
19.
Under pillar I, the CAS aimed to sustain performance of the cotton sector, accelerate
diversification and increase exports, enhance the business environment, and improve access to
regional and international markets.
20.
Sustain performance of the cotton sector. Cotton production remains a mainstay of
commercial agriculture but government involvement is still required through subsidies to cottonproducing companies or majority ownership in the largest cotton company (SOFITEX). While the
cotton productivity target of 1,100 kg/ha was exceeded by a small margin in 2011 the three cotton
companies did not generate a profit as targeted under the CAS, and SOFITEX remains quite
inefficient.
21.
Increase agricultural productivity and improve environmental management. There was
progress on this outcome but objectives were only partially achieved. Cereal production exceeded the
2012 target in 2010, but fell in 2012, and increases in milk production fell substantially short of
expectations. Regarding food security there is no data, as the warranty systems (inventory credit
systems) were not implemented. As for environmentally sustainable land and water management
practices, no data was collected and an agreed indicator was dropped from the project Key
Performance Indicators.

22.
Accelerate diversification and increase exports. Gold and cotton remain the principal
exports, and Burkina Faso has made modest headway in diversifying its productive base. Gold export
volume increased from 5.6 metric tons in 2008 to 34 metric tons in 2012—and value soared due to
higher world prices for gold—while the volume of cotton exports oscillated in the 140-150 thousand of
metric tons range. Cotton remains the backbone of the rural economy and accounts for more than
2 million jobs, but also exposes farmers to volatile world prices and weather shocks. At the same
time, meat exports did not increase as envisaged in the CAS, in part because export slaughterhouses
did not meet required standards for export. Onion production increased but did not reach productivity
targets in the CAS.
23.
The three outcomes above were supported by a number of Bank interventions. The Poverty
Reduction Support Credit 9-11 (FY10-FY12) supported the restructuring and recapitalization of
SOFITEX—the main cotton processing company—where the state has a majority share. The
company remains financially stressed due to weak management. The Agricultural Productivity and
Food security Project (FY10) helped improve the capacity of poor farmers to produce food and
promoted the availability of food products in rural markets. The project encouraged farmers to adopt
new technologies through learning events that used demonstration plots for such technologies
(maize, millet sorghum, rice and cowpea). The Agriculture Diversification and Market Development
Project (FY06) continues to fund micro-projects, support the creation of a new organization for
exporters and traders of mangoes, start construction of small-scale irrigation for 260 ha and support
two centralization poles for fruits and vegetables. Progress in most of these fronts is tempered by
delays in irrigation and marketing infrastructure work as well as in a system of market information and
business intelligence that is not operational yet. AAA considered in the CAS for these outcomes was
dropped. There is no information on a regional mining sector TA, other than for a small technical
assistance loan supporting this sector. A MIGA guarantee is mentioned in support of the
competitiveness project but was not carried out.
24.
IFC supported two gold mine projects at the exploration stage through its equity investments
in junior minors. One of the projects is in the second stage of a bankable feasibility study to determine
whether a full project can be financed. The recent decline in gold prices, sharp declines in stock
prices of goldmine operators, and the risk of a repeat of the 2011 political unrest are all challenges to
these projects’ financial closure and starting production.
25.
Enhance enabling environment for private sector-led diversification. The business
environment improved at a slower pace than envisaged under the CAS. The cost of business start-up
procedures fell below the 50 percent of GNI per capita targeted in the CAS, but the number of days
needed to create an enterprise is still above the 11 days targeted in the CAS and the share of credit
to the private sector in GDP increased only slightly (to 18 percent of GDP in 2012) compared with the
baseline in 2009 (16 percent). This mixed picture and slow progress in improving the business
environment is confirmed by the scores on the global competiveness index of the World Economic
Forum which fell from 3.36/7 in 2008 to 3.34/7 in 2012, reflecting stagnant basic institutional and
infrastructure requirements with a score that stayed flat at 3.45/7 during the period. Overall it is
unclear how the modest achievements under this outcome helped private-sector led diversification or
the quality of private investments. The CASCR does not address this issue.
26.
While the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (FY10-FY12) had some success in the
development of agriculture as reported, their impact on private sector development and environment
was modest. Despite the difficult environment with political unrest and turmoil in 2011 that occurred at
the mid-point of the CAS and lasted for 6 months, IFC helped improve the business climate in Burkina
Faso through its Doing Business line of advisory services, and it also supported successful reforms in
business start-up, construction permits, and contract enforcement. Moreover, under the program,
lower courts adopted a new case management system and software.
27.
Improve access to regional and international markets. As a landlocked country, Burkina
faces high cost and time-consuming transportation for its imports and exports. Although there is some
indication of reduction in average time for exports and imports (from 45 to 41 days, and from 54 to 49
days, respectively) during the CAS period, this reduction was below CAS targets and seems a poor

CASCR Review

indication of access to markets. The share of roads in fair and good condition improved significantly
compared to a baseline of 50 percent, but it is unclear if this led to increased transit to regional and
international markets. An indicator of access to electricity by households—which was met—appears
to be indirectly connected to the outcome of access to markets. At the same time the West Africa
Transport and Transit Facilitation Project (FY08)—which is of direct relevance to the objective
because it would reduce transport delays along the Tema-Ouagadougou-Bamako corridor and
facilitate Burkina Faso’s access to the sea—has seen implementation delayed because of political
turmoil in Mali and slow implementation of civil works in Ghana.
28.
Other than IFC’s Doing Business Report, no other AAA is listed in support of this outcome
and TA support in the CAS planned for this sub-objective appears to have been dropped.
29.
Bank Group support during this period helped sustain performance in the cotton sector,
although cotton companies still do not produce a profit as envisaged. But the other outcomes under
this pillar (on agriculture productivity, exports, environment for private sector, and access to markets)
were only partially achieved. IEG rates the overall outcome for this pillar as moderately unsatisfactory.
Pillar 2: Sharing growth through improved service delivery
30.
Under pillar II, the CAS aimed to improve demand for quality social services, enhance the
efficiency of public resource management, and strengthen institutions for delivery of quality social
services.
31.
Improve demand for quality social services. There has been progress in this area through
improving the accountability linkages between the local policy makers and citizens. The participation
of municipal and village councils in annual performance reviews and reporting on their activities
improved significantly. Municipal councils receiving a satisfactory rating during their annual
performance reviews increased from a low of 40 percent in 2010 to a high of nearly 90 percent in
2012. Moreover, in line with the CAS target, close to 90 percent of village development councils
organized annual public meetings to report on activities in 2012 from a baseline of 65 percent in 2006.
32.
The implementation of decentralization policy—intended to improve primary service
delivery—has been slow because of modest administrative capacity at the municipal level and
inefficiencies in line ministries that were supposed to be decentralized. The Administration Capacity
Building Project (FY05) helped strengthen central government resource management capacity but did
not develop a decentralization roadmap (including M&E system) as envisaged. The latter has been
undertaken by the Local Government Support Project (FY12), which is also making progress in
enhancing local government accountability with the recruitment of local en regional NGOs that will
help local council oversight and citizen engagement in decision-making. A number of AAA products
are listed in the CASCR in support of this sub-objective but there is no performance information on
any of them.
33.
Enhance efficiency of public resource management for better service delivery. Nearly
60 percent of Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability indicators were rated A or B in 2011
just shy of the CAS target. No data is available on the OECD DAC indicator for procurement that was
targeted to increase under the CAS. (PA)
34.
In addition to the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (FY10-FY12), this outcome was
supported by a grant for Strengthening Public Sector Control Institutions (FY07) which helped
develop public finance management capacity through the implementation of a risk-based
methodology and a quality assurance system in line with international standards. Another grant—
Community Monitoring for Service delivery (FY10)—helped the poorest rural municipalities plan and
implement local development activities in a participatory manner. There is no information on the
performance of the Bank’s Public Expenditure Review and the country systems TA approved in FY10.
35.
Strengthen institutions for delivery of quality social services. Institutions were
strengthened at the municipal level, and on education, health, nutrition, family planning, water and
sanitation, and social safety nets. According to the data provided all municipalities prepare and submit

budgets on time and over 90 percent of them have appropriate number of qualified staff. Access time
to education and health facilities fell as envisaged in the CAS, primary education and secondary
education enrollment were also close to targets as was the increase in primary completion rate.
Secondary education completion rate (8 percent in 2011) was far from the target of 31 percent for
2012 but the CASCR does not provide an explanation for this poor result. In health services, targeted
vaccinations, use of treated bed nets, reduction of meningitis fatalities, and pre-natal consultations
were all met. Moreover, progress was made in higher use of skilled birth personnel, the number
retroviral treatments, better nutrition and family planning. But outcomes were not as promising in
urban water and sanitation, with the exception of safe water access in Ouagadougou. Regarding
social safety nets all that was required was a review and this one was done, but whether the
percentage of poor covered increased is not known.
36.
This outcome was supported by the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (FY07-FY10) and
trust funded projects in education and health. Moreover, a Bank project on secondary education
(Second Post-Primary Education Project (FY06)) helped improve secondary education, although the
target for intake into secondary education was missed by a small margin and the closing date of the
project had to be extended by nearly three years because of procurement problems. The Basic
Education Project (FY02) on the other hand was rated moderately unsatisfactory do to very slow
implementation that led to the cancellation of significant project resources. Still, the important
objective of primary school completion rate was met as the rate increased from 23 percent in 2001 to
54½ percent in 2001 (51 percent target). But the poor performance of Bank interventions in basic
education makes attribution of results in this area difficult. The Health Sector Support and Multi-sector
AIDS Project (FY06) has been making slow progress on improving access and quality of priority
health. Implementation of the nutrition component of the project is lagging behind the rest of the
project. The Bank also has delivered or is delivering reports on the education (FY09) and health
(FY13) sectors, and a Social Safety Nets Review in FY10. Other pieces of AAA were dropped from
the original CAS plan.
37.
Bank group support helped improve demand for quality of social services and strengthen
institutions for delivery of quality social services. Public resource management is improving but at a
fairly slow pace. Overall, this pillar is rated moderately satisfactory.

implementation of a number of projects. Under pillar I, Bank Group support during this period helped
sustain performance in the cotton sector, although cotton companies still do not produce a profit as
envisaged. But the other outcomes under this pillar (on agriculture productivity, exports, environment
for private sector, and access to markets) were only partially achieved. Pillar II focused on the right
issues to help Burkina move towards achievement of the MDGs. Interventions pursued complex and
challenging institutional changes for the provision of better public services and to improve the
accountability of local officials responsible for delivering those services. Bank group support helped
improve demand for quality of social services and strengthen institutions for delivery of quality social
services. Public resource management also improved but at a fairly slow pace. The CAS “crosscutting” issues of governance and capacity improvements applied mostly to pillar II but the CASCR is
silent on how the objectives of the cross-cutting issues were achieved.
IDA Performance:
39.
IEG rates IDA performance as moderately satisfactory, concurring with the CASCR. The CAS
design was aligned with country priorities and its activities were highly relevant to key sectors of the
development strategy, but the CAS results framework was aspirational rather than realistic given
Burkina Faso’s weak administrative capacities. Yet, the CAS by aiming high and being flexible
promoted progress in the country’s all-important productive, institutional, and social dimensions. On
the downside, the CAS was dispersed across too many areas and activities, and this did not bode well
for implementation. A significant number of planned loans and AAA activities in the CAS were dropped
and replaced by other interventions as the period unfolded and priorities changed, but the CASCR
does not provide a full rationale for the changes. The WBG’s supervision and project implementation
was hampered by poor monitoring and evaluation frameworks that combined with weak client
administrative capacity to lead to significant delays in the implementation of projects. A review of ISR
assessments shows little concern for implementation risk, which is hardly mentioned. This invited an
unfortunate arms-length involvement by project teams that contributed to implementation delays and
to several missed outcomes. As a consequence, results suffered. The Bank appears to have
coordinated well with development partners, particularly in the provision of budget support. Moreover,
during the CAS period it helped the government carry out a Consultative Group Meeting with the aim
of aligning ODA to the government priorities and to the emerging SCADD.
IFC Performance:
40.
IFC’s strategy of concentrating on making mining sector investments and continuing advisory
services on improving business climate was relevant, considering importance of the mining sector for
Burkina Faso, its small scale economy, and the lack of suitable IFC clients for investments. IFC’s
additionality was present in attracting private investors and setting international standards for
environment management for two mining projects at the early feasibility stage. In addition to producing
a Doing Business report, IFC’s advisory services helped introduce alternative dispute mechanisms in
Burkina Faso. Only IFC’s Doing Business Report was included in the CAS results framework for
monitoring and evaluation. CAS and CASCR are thus not an adequate document for monitoring
whether and to what extent IFC investments and advisory services have contributed to the
achievement of CAS objectives.

5. Assessment of CAS Completion Report
41.
The CASCR is well written but overly descriptive. There is little analysis of the contribution of
the WBG to outcomes, as the discussion is mostly about the results of specific IDA interventions
rather than the achievement of CAS outcomes. Therefore it is not easy to match cause and effect of
Bank interventions, and how they affected the targeted outcomes. Moreover, the CASCR provides no
direct evidence of how the CAS “cross-cutting” governance objectives were mainstreamed in the
supporting operations or how the GovID filter was applied, which makes assessments of outcomes
difficult. In addition it does not discuss IFC contributions or the synergy between the IDA and IFC in its
assessment of CAS outcomes. As noted this CAS appears to have been ‘flexible’ in nature and

interventions (both lending and AAA) responded fluidly to changing priorities, but the CASCR does not
provide a rationale for this evolution in CAS implementation which makes accountability for results
difficult.

6. Findings and Lessons
42.
The CASCR contains a number of well-deduced lessons, although they are presented in the
form of recommendations rather than lessons per se. Salient among these, given the importance for
Burkina Faso of regional activities, is the need for better management of regional projects through
improved internal Bank Group management coordination and incentives.
43.
IEG would add that a flexible approach to a CAS—especially in this case, with no mid-term
review and when so much is being pursued through budget support, trust funds, and multi-donor
efforts—can diminish accountabilities for performance. Moreover, weak risk assessments at the level
of interventions can delay program implementation, lead to over-commitment of resources, and affect
adversely the timeliness of expected outcomes.
