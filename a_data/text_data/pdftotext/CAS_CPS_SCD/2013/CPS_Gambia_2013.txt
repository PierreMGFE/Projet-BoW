ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The World Bank Group (WBG) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) greatly appreciate the close
and fruitful collaboration with the Government of The Gambia in the preparation of this Joint Partnership
Strategy.
The preparation of the JPS document was a team effort by both organizations’ country teams for The
Gambia. Many team members made substantial contributions by drafting parts of the document,
participating in review meetings and providing comments and advice. Special thanks go to Annette De
Kleine Feige, World Bank Senior Economist for The Gambia, for her tremendous support during the
finalization phase of this document, Rory O’Sullivan, Consultant, who helped in the initial stages of the
document preparation, Victor Wahba, Consultant, who elaborated the JAS-1 Completion Report, Upulee
Dasanayake, Consultant/Operations Analyst, for her patience in updating the document and her detailed
editorial support, and Anta Loum Lo for editing and finalizing the Board package. Last but not least,
special thanks to Badara Joof, World Bank Liaison Officer in Banjul, for his extremely valuable support in
facilitating multi-stakeholder consultations and dialogue with Government authorities throughout the full
process of strategy preparation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
The Gambia has had strong economic performance in recent years with average
annual real GDP growth of 6-7 percent during 2008-2010. But it has since dropped to 3.5 - 4
percent in 2012. Effects of the global financial crisis of 2008 were tempered by good agricultural
outputs in the same period, and by increased tourism receipts. Overall poverty rates declined from
58 percent in 2003 to 48.4 percent in 2010, and education coverage and quality improved.
Progress was made in the areas of public sector, economic and fiscal management, civil service
and justice reform, anti-corruption and public procurement reform. Recent data show modest
developments in health, notably on HIV/AIDS prevalence (which remains stable) and maternal
mortality (which declined considerably). The Government is committed to consolidating these
achievements while creating space for continued funding of poverty reduction programs.
ii.
As a small, open economy, however, The Gambia remains highly vulnerable to
external shocks, given its relatively undiversified economic base. The Gambia is heavily
dependent on rain-fed crops for agricultural production, on imports for food security, and on
tourism receipts and remittances for foreign exchange earnings. The 2011-2012 Sahelian drought
crisis caused massive crop losses, with related impacts on household food security and nutrition,
the availability of seeds, and the balance of payments. GDP growth slowed to -4.3 percent in 2011
(compared to 5.5 percent in 2010). And Gambian transit and re-export trade activity has been
hampered by gains in competitiveness in neighboring countries, specifically Senegal, and the
impacts of the most recent crises in Mali and Guinea-Bissau. Finally, the country’s vulnerability
to climate change, land degradation and disaster risk explicitly highlights the need to promote and
strengthen integrated management of the coastal zone and to protect and preserve biological
diversity and ecological assets.
iii.

The Gambia faces three main challenges:
a. Restoring growth and macroeconomic stability. This will require diversification of
the economy and an improved private sector investment climate.
b. Improving service delivery, through effective civil service reform including
improved management capacity for strategic planning, performance measurement,
and institutional coordination, collaboration and dialogue.
c. Improving transparency and accountability in public financial management and
public procurement. In particular, improving the demand side of public financial
management by disseminating information to the public and creating a culture of
accountability and citizen participation.

iv.
The second AfDB/WB Joint Partnership Strategy (JPS-2) for the 2013-16 period, in
support of the Government’s 2012-15 Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment
(PAGE)1 proposes to respond to these challenges by concentrating on two main pillars:
Pillar 1:
Enhancing Productive Capacity and Competitiveness in order to strengthen resilience to
External Shocks. This pillar is aligned with elements of PAGE pillars I (Economic Growth), II
(Infrastructure) and IV (Governance).

viii

Pillar 2:
Strengthening the Institutional Capacity for Economic Governance and Public Service
Delivery is aligned with elements of PAGE pillars III (Human Capital, Social Services), IV
(Governance) and V (Social Cohesion, Cross-cutting interventions).
The AfDB will focus on economic governance and agriculture, while the World Bank Group
(WBG) will, in addition to these, focus on infrastructure, i.e. the energy sector and internet
connectivity, human development, and private sector development.
v.
This Joint Strategy has been prepared and will be implemented jointly by the AfDB
and the WBG to better harmonize the two institutions’ assistance to The Gambia in line with the
2011 Busan Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Completion Report of the first Joint
Assistance Strategy (JAS, 2008-11) concluded that this collaborative approach was successful in
improving the impact of the development efforts by the two institutions – allowing them to align
their development programs, avoid duplication of efforts, and combine their technical expertise.
To this end, the WBG and the AfDB have been working together to develop shared objectives and
a common platform for lending and non-lending activities during the coming JPS period.
vi.
Over the four year JPS period, about US$90 million in lending, supplemented by
trust fund (TF) resources, will be available to support The Gambia’s PAGE. This support
will be complemented by analytical work and other non-lending activities. The program design is
currently based on the assumption of (a) a three-year (2012-14) African Development Fund
(ADF) resource allocation for new commitments of UA3 million (equivalent to US$4.5 million)
from ADF 12 available for 2012 and 2013; (b) UA 8 million (equivalent to US$12 million) from
ADF 13 available for 2014 and 2015; and (c) an indicative IDA-16 allocation of SDR29.8
million (equivalent to US$44.7 million) followed by estimated IDA-17 annual allocations of
about US$14 million, supplemented by TF resources.
vii.
The proposed JPS-2 also takes into account the complementary efforts of other
donors. As part of the program, both institutions will seek to strengthen their communication
with other donors and help the Government improve donor coordination in the country.
viii. Risks: The proposed program carries risks. The overall country risks are vulnerability
to exogenous shocks and governance-related risks, notably with respect to accountability and
transparency in the management of public resources. Major policy reversals and other unexpected
decisions, such as the President’s temporary introduction in late October 2012 of a fixed exchange
rate peg of the GMD to the US dollar is a cause of concern. The temporary lifting of the
moratorium on capital punishment with the executions of nine death row inmates in August 2012,
and the most recent introduction of a four-day work week for the public service represent
challenges for the Government’s dialogue with internal and external stakeholders. Those actions
have reduced confidence in the Government’s commitment to its international agreements. These
risks will be closely monitored by both Banks and their impacts on the joint program mitigated by
continued strong collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the EU, and other
donors on macro-economic management, program design and implementation support.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The Gambia is the smallest country on the African mainland. Its stretches 450 km
along the Gambia River. Its 11,285 sq. km area is surrounded by Senegal, except for a 60 km
Atlantic Ocean front. Although small in size, The Gambia harbors a wealth of land, coastal,
marine and wetland habitats and species of local, national, regional and global significance,
making Gambia an attractive tourist destination and, due to is unique geographic location, a hub
for trade in the region.
2.
The country has a population of 1.8 million and a Diaspora of around 0.5 million.
The current population has been growing at a fairly high rate of 2.8 percent per year over
the last decade. Life expectancy at birth for the average Gambian is 58 years and 60 percent of
the population is under 25 years of age. Most of the population (57 percent) is concentrated
around urban and peri-urban centers. The main languages are English, Mandinka, Wolof, Jola and
Fula, and 90 percent of Gambians are Muslim. The Gambia has maintained a reputation of
relative stability and peace, although its sub-region has been marked by recurring instability and
conflict. The incumbent President 2 Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh was re-elected for a fourth term on
November 24, 2011, receiving 72 percent of the popular vote.
3.
The Gambia is facing serious challenges in achieving most of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). According to the World Development Indicators database, the
poverty reduction goal at the poverty line of US$1.25 has been achieved. In terms of human
development, The Gambia has achieved the MDGs related to gender parity in primary and
secondary education, and to improved access to water sources. Progress towards all other MDGs
is off-target. The MDGs related to primary school completion rates (even though considerable
progress has been made), infant and child mortality, measles vaccination and births not attended
by skilled staff are seriously off-target, and will not be reached any time soon if current policies
are continued and donor support is maintained at current levels (Annex 6).
4.
Regional integration and cooperation are extremely important for The Gambia, due
to its limited surface area, population size and markets, and its geographical position as a
semi-enclave into Senegalese territory. Any developments affecting the sub-region, specifically
Senegal, affect the country’s growth prospects, the sustainability of its natural resource basis, and
its political stability. The Gambia is a member of regional bodies such as the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Gambia River Basin Development
Organization (OMVG). Based on its historic linkages to Great Britain, the Gambia is also a
member of the (British) Commonwealth. Given its location, The Gambia will need to collaborate
closely with Senegal to overcome two major hurdles that might hamper its integration in the sub
region, namely the quality of Senegalese roads and the willingness of Senegalese authorities to
facilitate transit trade.

Economic Developments

5.
The Gambia’s average per capita GDP was US$610 in 2011 (Atlas Method). GDP
composition by sector is depicted in Table 1 below for 2005-2012 The composition though stable
can shift somewhat, due to variations in crop production, but the broad proportions highlight the
importance of the agriculture and trade (including tourism) sectors, and weak manufacturing
activity.

approximately US$373.5 million
in nominal terms until 2050. The total estimated nominal debt relief under both the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative and the MDRI, on principal as well as interest payments is equivalent to about
US$514 million.
7.
Fiscal discipline slipped in 2009 and 2010, but has since improved. The deterioration
was partly due to the unstable global environment and declining tourism receipts. But it also
reflected an increase in tax exemptions on imports, and delays in adjusting the pump prices for
petroleum products. In 2011, the Government generated a basic primary fiscal surplus3 estimated
at 1.2 percent of GDP which is projected to rise to 1.6 percent in 2012, up from minus 0.4 percent
in 2010. This has helped to contain the Government’s net domestic borrowing. It also helped
clear the Government’s overdraft with the Central Bank and, with that, marked an end to the
Central Bank financing of the deficit (see Table 2, below).
8.
Prudent fiscal management is particularly important given the country’s relatively
high public debt to GDP ratio, with low maturity levels for domestic debt. Foreign and
domestic public debt remains high, notwithstanding the country having reached the HIPC/MDRI
completion point at end 2007. The key exposure indicators of the IMF and WB show that total
debt outstanding as a ratio to GDP declined from 143.2 percent in 2006 (pre-HIPC) to 55.1
percent in 2008. However, it increased again to 68.4 percent in 2011, reflecting the combination
of a fast-growing, high-cost, domestic public debt (29 percent of GDP), and a slow-growing,
mostly concessional external public debt (39 percent of GDP). Thanks to improvements in its
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating, The Gambia has been upgraded to a
medium performer, with higher policy thresholds for the assessment of the sustainability of its
debt. There is now some scope for the government to borrow on non-concessional terms. This
and the inclusion of re-exports have resulted in a decrease in the risk of debt distress, from high
debt distress to medium in 2012. However, near and medium-term external debt sustainability
remains vulnerable to adverse shocks, and domestic debt is costly and poses high rollover risks.
Further, it is important to note that active debt management – with a view to minimizing
budgetary risks and ensuring long-term debt sustainability - is one of the criteria for the
determination of the IDA and ADF Resource Allocation Indicators (RAI).

9.
Large fiscal deficits in recent years have forced the Government to resort to
borrowing from the domestic market where interest rates are high. Interest on foreign and
domestic debt in 2011 accounted for an estimated 22.5 percent of public revenues with 18.5
percent of revenues absorbed by domestic debt service alone. While the real yield on the total
public debt is relatively low (averaging less than 5 percent), this average conceals the very high
average interest rates on the domestic public debt (just under 9 percent). There is a significant
domestic debt refinancing exposure.4 The average time to maturity of the external debt is 14.5
years, whereas the average time to maturity of the stock of domestic debt is less than one year.
As a result, the servicing of domestic public debt has crowded out private sector borrowing by
putting upward pressure on domestic interest rates. This has also reduced the available revenues
for development spending. The Government is currently implementing a fiscal adjustment
program aimed at reducing the net domestic borrowing to 0.5 percent of GDP by 2014.
10.
As part of the fiscal consolidation effort, a comprehensive tax reform program is
being envisaged to help stabilize revenues. Actions are being taken to set limits on how tax
exemptions are being awarded, to strengthen tax administration and to raise tax payer awareness
of the application of tax laws and the coverage of the value-added tax (VAT). These actions will
be further strengthened by the establishment and institutionalization of the Tax Tribunal. Better
and more frequent human resources planning for payroll management and control given the
increase in the civil service over the last few years is under consideration. The validation of the
Human Resource records in the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS)
payroll module envisioned under the proposed grant would allow for the regularization of these
records, with the removal of ghost workers and the elimination of vacant positions. This will, in
effect, strengthen the base for a more judicious management of the personnel records, including
the inclusion of new entrants into the payroll, under the auspices of the Personnel Management
Office. These actions will further safeguard the acceptable macroeconomic framework achieved
in 2011.
3

11.
The IMF-supported Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program includes additional
initiatives to maintain and enhance the country’s current fiscal discipline. Actions under the
ECF program to increase tax revenue collection include the closer alignment of domestic fuel
prices with international prices in 2012, and the introduction of the VAT in 2013. These and other
actions will help to reduce annual domestic financing needs and create fiscal space for the
implementation of the Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE).
12.
The IMF postponed its First Review of the Extended Credit Facility from late-2012
until early-2013, due to uncertainties about monetary policy implementation following the
President of Gambia’s decree in October 2012 that introduced a fixed exchange rate peg and
controls on US-dollar shipments. The controls on shipments were subsequently lifted within a
week of the decree’s announcement and the exchange rate peg was lifted in November 2012 with
the reintroduction of a market determined floating exchange rate. The IMF conducted a mission in
December 2012 to assess the impact of the monetary policy shifts, and determined that exchange
rate activity had largely returned to normal and that uncertainty pertaining to the recent policy
shifts had diminished substantially. Nevertheless, market confidence in the Government’s
commitment to the stated exchange rate policy has been eroded. Confidence can only be regained
over time by the Central Bank's ongoing commitment to the market determined exchange rate
policy complemented by the gradual accumulation of international reserves to support
macroeconomic stability. The IMF is finalizing the First Review of the ECF for Board Review.
An Article IV mission is planned following the IMF-WB 2013 Spring Meetings, and the Second
Review of the ECF is envisaged in fall 2013.

Box 1: The Effects of Climate Change in the Gambia
The Gambia is one of the most vulnerable countries in Africa to the
adverse impacts of climate change. With approximately 50% of the
total land area being less than 20m above sea level, and about 33% of
the country below 10m above sea level, any significant global
warming-induced sea level rise could submerge much of the country.
Currently, about 20% of the country is flooded annually and the
mangrove ecosystems are already affected by saline intrusion as well
as flooding.
Linear trends indicate that wet season rainfall in The Gambia has
decreased significantly between 1960 and 2006, at an average rate of
8.8mm per month per decade. Projected annual change ranges from ‐
23 to +18% by the 2090s, with increasing occurrence of heavy rainfall
events.
Global warming and associated impacts of climate change, as well as
projected extreme weather and climatic events will compound efforts
to address the development challenges of the country in the face of
rapid population growth: The country’s First National Communication
projected that about 92 sq. km of land in the coastal zone will be
inundated as result of 1m sea level rise. Accordingly, the whole of the
capital city of Banjul will be lost due to the fact that the greater part of
the city is below 1m. The report also predicts negative effects of
projected climate change on crop production, biodiversity and wildlife,
coastal resources, forestry etc. Effective adaptation to climate change
and its mainstreaming into national development is a pre-condition for
sustainable development.

14.
The Gambia is also vulnerable as a result of its heavy reliance on rain-fed
agriculture, which has led to wide variability in agricultural activity. The severe drought in
2011 and concomitant 60 percent drop in crop production and depletion of seed stores are cases in
point. Notably, with favorable weather conditions, the agriculture sector witnessed substantial
growth in the years5 before the 2011 Sahelian drought which had buoyed domestic consumer
demand and, with that, more than offset the negative impacts of the global economic crisis during
2008 through 2010. The sector is characterized by subsistence production of rain-fed crops (such
as coarse grains, rice, etc.) and semi-intensive cash crop production (groundnuts and vegetables).
Groundnuts are the most important agricultural export, accounting for 60 percent of domestic
exports.
15.
Food security in The Gambia is strongly dependent on imports. Cereal imports
account for 50-60 percent of consumption needs and the average Gambian spends more than 60
percent of his/her income on food in a normal year. The rising food prices since 2007 began on
the heels of locust invasion and a series of droughts that affected both cereals and cash crop
(groundnut) production. In light of rising prices of cereal crops many Gambians have faced
serious hardships in terms of household food security.
16.
The Gambia’s coastal and marine areas, where a large proportion of the country’s
population resides, are under increasing pressure. Population growth and in-migration as a
result of disrupted rainfall patterns and land degradation in the hinterland translate into growing
pressure on coastal and marine resources, including from sand mining, fishing, and clearing of
forest and mangroves for use as domestic fuel. There is also evidence of significant pressure on
species of global and regional concern6. With the further destruction of coastal areas, one of the
country’s primary tourism attractions might be compromised, and with it, one of its major sources
of revenues.

1.2

Political and Governance Context

17.
The Gambia is a presidential republic with a unicameral legislature. The incumbent
President7 Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh, who originally took office in a bloodless coup in 1994, was reelected for a fourth term, with 72 percent of the vote, on November 24, 2011. Parliamentary
elections took place on March 29, 2012, with the President’s party (the Alliance for Patriotic
Reorientation and Construction, or APRC) maintaining its sizeable majority, with 43 seats in the
53-seat National Assembly. 8 Most opposition parties boycotted the elections due to concerns
related to the timing and context of the elections, and to what they perceived as an absence of a
level playing field for competition in the election process. 9 Women continue to be underrepresented at all political levels.
18.
Progress has been made in selected areas of governance. In the face of still pervasive
corruption 10 , the Government is in the process of establishing an Anti-Corruption Agency to
coordinate and consolidate integrity activities within the public sector. Since the early 2000s, the
country’s public procurement system has undergone substantial reforms 11 and there has been
moderate progress in the field of justice.12
19.
While economic governance has been improving, political governance indicators
have declined 13 , and recent major policy reversals have undermined confidence in the
Government’s commitment to its international agreements. For example, The Gambia’s August
2012 executions of nine death row inmates, including two Senegalese nationals, in breach of the
Geneva Conventions and Cotonou Agreement, have unfavorably affected its relations with
Senegal - even though the moratorium on capital punishment has been re-instated one month
later. Another example is the President’s temporary introduction in late October 2012 of an adhoc fixed exchange rate peg that risked the overall macro-framework and diminished confidence
in The Gambia’s commitment to the ECF arrangement signed with the IMF earlier in 2012.
20.
The 2012 Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance ranks The Gambia in the middle
of the countries of the continent. The Gambia scores 51.6 (out of 100) for governance quality –
slightly lower than the regional average for West Africa of 51.9 - and is ranked 27th out of 52
countries. The Gambia ranks relatively well among its West African peers on the 2011 Global
Gender Gap Index, at 77 (out of 135), ahead of neighboring Senegal (rank 92) and Mauritania
(rank 114). The Freedom in the World 2012 report categorizes The Gambia as “not free”. Internal
governance issues have had an unfavorable impact on economic development by, at times,
compromising relations with neighboring countries, development partners, and internal
stakeholder groups. Poor governance also undermines urgently needed private sector investments
due to concerns related to corruption, political interference and the rule of law.
21.
Weak public sector capacity remains a significant constraint. The Government
recently launched a new Civil Service Reform Strategy (2012-2015) building on previous
initiatives. The strategy comprises seven components dealing with broad areas of public sector
performance, pay and pension reforms, accountability and service delivery. Earlier activities,
supported by UNDP and Spain, have improved capacity in public sector management and egovernance, the justice sector, and the National Assembly14.

1.3 Social Context
22.
The Gambia ranks 168th out of 187 on the 2011 Human Development Index and will
not achieve most of the MDGs (Annex 6). Some gains have been recorded in education, health
and nutrition in recent years; however, many challenges remain.
23.
The Government made commendable progress with respect to education coverage,
and quality has started to improve as well. The Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) for lower basic
education increased considerably in the last few years and reached 90 percent in 2012 (including
the certified madrassas which follow the regular curriculum) which is at par with the SSA
average. Gender parity has been achieved at both the lower basic and upper basic levels. With a
primary completion rate of 72 percent, The Gambia compares well with other countries and, if it
accelerates efforts to improve the quality of education, might be able to attain universal primary
completion by 2020.
24.
Progress in health indicators has been less consistent and The Gambia is unlikely to
achieve any of the health-related MDGs: This includes maternal as well as infant and underfive child mortality rates and the percentage of births not assisted by skilled staff. The under-five
child mortality is 106 in the Gambia, compared to 77 in Senegal. As to projections based on
progress in the past five years, the MDG targets for infant and under-five child mortality will be
reached only towards the end of the century or in the 2030s, respectively, if current policies
continue to be implemented as they were in the most recent past - and/or donor support is
maintained at the current levels. Earlier progress in reducing malnutrition has stalled in recent
years: According to the new World Health Organization (WHO) standards, stunting increased
between 2000 and 2005 from 24 to 28 percent, but fell to 23 percent in 201015. Projections on the
MDG target related to undernourishment show insufficient progress, reflecting, amongst others,
the impact of the 2011 drought.
25.
The latest sero-surveillance data indicate that the HIV-1 prevalence rate is stable and
not significantly improving. With a prevalence rate of 0.9 percent amongst adults aged 15 to 49,
according to UNAIDS estimates for 200716, it is at a very low level for Sub-Saharan Africa17.
26.
Though well executed, the poverty programs are primarily contingent on continued
donor support. The budget execution rate of social programs in 2011 was 96.5 percent (see
Table 4). The highest rates were recorded for education, health and nutrition programs, which
reached percentages in the upper 90s. However, most of the program budgets went to wages and
salaries.

1.4 Poverty Profile and Trends
27.
Poverty noticeably declined during the last decade, but remains widespread with
considerable regional variation. The overall poverty rate was an estimated 48.4 percent 18 in
2010, down from an estimated 58.0 percent in 2003.19 While there are problems of comparability,
this suggests a fairly high elasticity of poverty with respect to growth and therefore a relatively
inclusive pattern of growth. This is broadly consistent with the important role played by
agriculture during this period.
28.
There are large regional variations of poverty within The Gambia, with urban areas
recording (based on the upper poverty line) a much lower poverty headcount (32.7 percent)
compared with rural areas (73.9 percent). However, there appears to have been a modest
narrowing of the gap, with poverty actually increasing in the Banjul area, probably due to rapid
migration from rural areas. At the same time, the poorest region, Central River Region-North,
enjoyed the largest decline in poverty between 2003 and 2010, although 79 percent of its
population remains poor. Inequality appears to be somewhat higher than in neighboring
Senegal20.
29.
The extreme poverty rate for female-headed households is significantly lower than
for male headed households – 38 as compared to 51 percent. Factors explaining these figures
include the fact that bigger households, which are most often headed by males, are generally
poorer than those with fewer members. Also, female-headed households are mostly found in the
urban areas, with household heads more often than not gainfully employed. Remittances from
abroad continue to play a significant role in these households. However, the female labor force21
is predominantly rural, and less-skilled, and earns less income than male workers.
30.
The unemployed in The Gambia are more likely to be young, urban, female, and
better educated – reflecting the weakness of the country’s formal economy. 22 Nearly 60
percent of the poor in The Gambia are under the age of 20. Youth face significant challenges with
respect to employment outcomes, such as very difficult transition from school to work and very
low levels of education and training. Rural unemployment rates are low and vary little across the
whole age spectrum, predominantly as a result of rural workers being absorbed into low pay, low
qualification, high informality and low quality jobs in the agriculture sector. In cities and towns,
the services sector is the most important source of employment, particularly for young people,
accounting for almost 65 percent of employed youth aged 20-24 years.

1.5 Major Development Challenges
31.
The Gambia faces three main challenges that need to be addressed to increase
resilience, and allow for more adequate responses to external shocks, including volatile weather
conditions and the effects of climate change:


Restoring growth and macroeconomic stability. This will require in particular
diversification of the economy and an improved private sector investment climate.



Improving service delivery. This will require effective civil service reform including
improved management capacity for strategic planning, performance measurement, and
institutional coordination, collaboration and dialogue.



Improving transparency and accountability in public financial management and public
procurement. The demand-side of public financial management needs to be improved
8

by disseminating information to the public and creating a culture of accountability and
citizen participation.

Reestablishing Growth and Macroeconomic Stability
32.
Sustained reforms are required to enhance the business environment, in order to
underpin growth and private sector employment. In the 2013 Doing Business Report, The
Gambia is ranked 147th out of 185 countries and has dropped in all indicators except enforcing
contracts. The Gambia’s ranking in the Global Competitiveness Report slipped from 81th of 133
in 2009/2010 to 98th of 144 in 2011/2012, but it remains the highest ranked in West Africa. The
Report identified access to finance 23 and tax rates as the most problematic factors for doing
business, far ahead of other issues such as tax and foreign currency regulations and inadequate
infrastructure.
33.
The energy sector of The Gambia - a major bottleneck for the business environment
- faces a number of challenges ranging from structural and operational issues to the need
for significant capital to upgrade and expand its generation, transmission and distribution
capacity. The high cost and the lack of availability of electricity is a serious constraint to
enterprise development and there is also concern that the sector amasses substantial contingent
liabilities. The parastatal, the National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC) is facing
serious financial issues, and efforts are needed to improve its financial viability and operational
performance24, including efforts to address power transmission and distribution losses. Given the
small size and geographic position of the country, The Gambia will need to explore options for
power generation and distribution in close cooperation with neighbors in the region such as
through joint projects under the River Gambia Development Organization (OMVG).
34.
Weak telecommunications links have affected the competitiveness of the business
sector for many years, but basic telecommunications infrastructure is now being
transformed by improved overseas and regional links. Access to the new high capacity
submarine Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) cable will connect The Gambia and other West African
countries with the rest of the world, and make telecom services, including high-speed internet
services, more reliable and affordable. The challenge then will be for local telephone companies
to provide an efficient technical and financial interface that will allow businesses and consumers
to take advantage of this new link.
35.
The Gambia’s performance in the tourism sector has been good as a result of recent
reforms and institutional changes. Recent efforts have focused on increasing air access, and
more needs to be done to (a) update the quality of accommodation (three stars and above); (b)
diversify tourism products; and (c) improve service delivery by adequately training staff and
fostering entrepreneurs.
36.
The agriculture sector continues to be constrained by (a) insufficiently developed
water management systems, leaving the country almost entirely dependent on rainfall, in spite of
the availability of important inland water resources; (b) timely accessibility of farmers to quality
inputs, credit, know-how and new technologies; (c) weakness in linkages for creating value added
through agro-processing; (d) excessive post-harvest losses paired with low value addition, caused
by weak storage, processing and marketing capabilities, and (e) climatic hazards, such as droughts
and floods. While these challenges need to be tackled on the level of Gambian communities and
households, regional cooperation on cross-cutting sector issues could play an important role in the
9

context of organizations such as OMVG and the West and Central African Council for
Agriculture Research (CORAF). Due to its relevance to the Gambian rural economy in terms of
income generation, the value chain linked to the groundnut subsector deserves particular
attention.
37.
Given the direct impacts of the most recent crises related to food price hikes,
drought, and decline in agricultural production, there is a need for reshaping the food
security agenda. A more coherent approach to food security will require that agricultural and
food security interventions be embedded in the community nutrition service delivery platform
(based on community needs, and implemented through community participation as opposed to top
down government implemented programs).
38.
Women across all ethnic groups do not have land rights in The Gambia. The
Government is committed to addressing this issue and the PAGE recognizes the need to
restructure the land tenure and inheritance system to correct for the “gender bias” and increase
agricultural productivity.25

Strengthening Public Service Capacity for Service Delivery
39.
Limited public sector capacity remains a significant constraint for service delivery.
The major capacity bottlenecks include
Box 2: Innovations in the Education Sector
inadequate coordination among the
various institutions within government. A number of innovations, analytical work and rigorous

limited accountability for results and policy decisions such as a conditional cash transfer for Imams
(religious leaders) to allow their students (from the Daaras) to
delays in the decision-making process.
40.
These constraints are rooted in
structural issues related to the incentive
structure and competencies in the civil
service, and frequent and unpredictable
reshuffling of key Government officials,
including ministers. In the short to
medium term, a focus on the efficient
management of human resources within
the civil service, including the recruitment
and retention of personnel should be a
first priority.

first grade to facilitate the acquisition of reading; a
community based ECD pilot; (iii) strategy building for higher
education policy, science and technology innovation and
inclusion of ICT in education for 21st century skills
development instead of traditional and rote learning methods;
(iv) a system of accountability, such as the introduction of
performance management system that is based on annual
service level agreements holding public sector servants
accountable to meet their annual goals; and school report
cards to share results with parents and communities at large.

10

Improving social services
41.
In the education sector, The Gambia has made significant strides in increasing the
number of students enrolled at all levels. The remaining challenges for the education sector
include (a) meeting the demands of hard to reach populations, in order to reach full enrollment,
(b) improving early childhood, senior secondary and higher education and skills development in
general, and (c) improving the quality of education overall, although important steps have already
been undertaken in terms of provision of learning materials, teacher training support and
provision of hardship allowances for qualified teachers in remote and poverty stricken areas26.
42.
A significant proportion of young people, especially in rural areas, leave school early,
in part because of perceived low returns on education. Many of those who do receive highquality education and training choose to emigrate. There is clearly a mismatch between skills and
market demand, and the gap between skilled and unskilled labor income, as well as urban and
rural income is widening. The Gambia will need to align skills with the demands of the private
sector labor market in promising sectors (tourism, agriculture, ICT), and provide incentives to
attract qualified Gambians who are residing abroad back to their home country.
43.
In the health sector, in order to achieve the health-related MDGs and meet the goals
set out in the PAGE 2012-2015, two priorities stand out: (a) maternal health and nutrition;
and (b) household food security. The current stagnation in maternal (and child) health and
nutrition outcome indicators is mainly associated with: (a) a decline in support for Primary Health
Care (PHC) in favor of a proportional increase in spending on tertiary health care, (b) the
virtualization of health programs related to specific diseases, such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and
tuberculosis, (c) centralized planning and budgeting, which leaves regions with little control over
service delivery programs, and (d) limited harmonization of donor support and intra-sectoral
funding processes.
44.
Existing social protection programs, including safety nets, are fragmented and
inefficient and do not respond to the needs of the chronic poor and the most vulnerable.
Very little is known about the actual effectiveness and scope of existing safety net interventions in
The Gambia. Most interventions are fairly small, temporary programs focused on short-term
emergency relief and financed by ad-hoc external resources, rather than elements of a coherent
medium-term strategy to protect the poor that could be scaled-up when a crisis occurs. A more
coherent approach is needed to link the development of social protection strategies to reforms
aimed at strengthening agriculture productivity, food security and nutrition outcomes at the
household level.
Improving Transparency and Accountability in Public Financial Management and Public
Procurement
45.
Public financial management and transparency have improved in recent years.
Progress is reflected in the findings of the 2010 Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA), the 2011 Public Expenditure Review (PER) Update, and the improved CPIA ratings.
One key achievement has been the establishment of an Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS). This system has improved the timeliness of financial reporting by
providing monthly and comprehensive within-year budget execution reports, which facilitate the
preparation of annual financial statements and subsequent budgets.27 As a next step, the IFMIS
system needs to be upgraded and further expanded to include donor-funded projects and linked to
the debt management system. Meanwhile, The Gambia has also reduced the backlog of audited
11

Government financial statements28, established a Tax Tribunal, and strengthened the internal audit
function.
46.
In the area of procurement, the Government issued a new report in March 2010 as
an update of its 2005 Country Procurement Issues Paper. The proposed reform agenda
includes three major objectives: (a) amending the Gambia Public Procurement Act, with a view to
de-linking regulation from implementation; (b) re-engineering the Gambia Public Procurement
Agency (GPPA) to become exclusively a regulatory body (similar to the Gambia Public Utilities
Regulatory Authority, PURA); and, (c) establishing a procurement cadre that will be responsible
for implementation. 29 To accelerate progress, the WBG will collaborate with the EU on an
operation to support public procurement reform under the EU’s governance program.

1.6

The Gambia’s Development Strategy and Priorities

Long-Term Vision and Priorities
47.
The Gambia’s long-term strategic goals were articulated in its Vision 2020, which
aimed “…to transform The Gambia into a financial center, a tourist paradise, a trading exportoriented agricultural and manufacturing nation, thriving on free market policies and a vibrant
private sector, sustained by a well-educated, skilled, healthy, self-reliant and enterprising
population, guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent standard of living for all,
under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry”.

The PAGE was discussed in the
IMF/IDA Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) of March 8, 2012.
49.
One key conclusion of the JSAN was that further prioritization of objectives and
activities is required given the constrained resource envelope. The Government estimates the
total cost of implementing the PAGE at US$943 million. Taking into account the resources
already available for on-going projects, the shortfall in resource requirements is more than
US$650 million. The Government is committed to contributing 35 percent of this amount, leaving
a financing gap of US$423 million to be financed by donors and the private sector.
12

50.
The JSAN also highlights the importance of regional integration for the country,
recommending that PAGE implementation pay close attention to regional trade arrangements. In
addition, it highlights the need to take advantage of regional programs funded by various donors,
including the AfDB and IDA programs on dry lands, water resources management, and regional
agriculture.
51.
One of the challenges for the PAGE implementation is the weakness of the country’s
statistical system. Improving the timeliness and quality of statistics would greatly support the
economic development program delineated in the PAGE, which now lacks target indicators for
development results due to a dearth of data or, in some cases, significant lags between completion
of field surveys and their publication. A further constraint is the limited capacity at all levels to
analyze and use data effectively. There is also a need to monitor and track governance and related
indicators, as well as to increase the frequency of disease surveillance and continue building the
database for health information. Improving macroeconomic accounts is also critical to better
support macroeconomic management. The JSAN recommends prioritizing implementation of the
Government’s “Strategic Plan for the Development of Statistics in The Gambia,” which focuses
on continued structural reforms and capacity building of the Gambia Bureau of Statistics. The
authorities have asked donors, including the WBG, to renew their support for the country’s
statistical system.

III.

THE AfDB AND WBG SECOND JOINT PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

2.1

Lessons from the Previous Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS), Stakeholder
Feedback and Gender Assessment

Lessons from the JAS-1 Completion Report
52.
Results and lessons from the first IDA/AfDB Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS-1) for
the period of 2008-11 were assessed in a JAS Completion Report (see Annex 3). The results
have been assessed as moderately satisfactory by both Banks as good progress was made towards
achieving most major expected outcomes.
53.
One of the key lessons from the experience of the JAS-1 is that the JAS was a useful
tool for coordinating the development efforts of both Banks. Despite some processing challenges
due to different disbursement schedules, the collaboration was determined to be very successful in
improving the impact of the development efforts by the two Banks, and should be continued. The
collaboration allowed the two institutions to align their development programs, avoid duplication
of efforts, and combine their technical expertise. WB and AfDB have worked together to develop
shared objectives and a common platform for lending and non-lending activities in line with the
country’s priorities.
Findings from WB IEG Evaluations, 2012 Country Survey, Stakeholder Consultations and
Portfolio Gender Assessment
54.
The ex-post project evaluations carried out by the WB Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG), lessons learned emphasize the importance of strong Government leadership, and
coordination between line ministries and implementing agencies, for the successful
implementation of programs and projects. A better understanding of political economy issues is
also critical for the effective design of sector reforms. IEG evaluations also highlighted the
importance of quality at entry, managerial and technical capacity and project management for
13

good project implementation.
55.
The FY12 Country Survey shows that the WB is valued for its work. Stakeholders
value the Bank’s policy and economic advice as much as its financial resources, and are satisfied
with the overall relationship. Issues raised were related to (a) alignment of the Bank’s priorities
with perceptions of the country’s top priorities; and (b) Bank procedures and policies (perceived
lack of flexibility, complexity of its financing and levels of bureaucracy). At the country level,
there is clear recognition that capacity is lacking and that reform efforts need to be tailored to
country challenges and circumstances.
56.
The content of the proposed JPS-2 is based on in-depth discussions with the Government
and consultations with donors and other stakeholders on various occasions, preceding a round of
more comprehensive multi-stakeholder consultations in March/April 2012.
57.
The 2012 WB Portfolio Gender Assessment concluded that the current IDA portfolio
in The Gambia is fully gender informed, meaning that the ongoing IDA and TF portfolio
addresses gender-related aspects in their analysis and/or actions, specifically with respect to (a)
gender parity in basic lower and upper education levels; (b) productivity and access to markets for
female farmers; (c) nutrition of children and lactating women. Some operations also have a
substantial gender informed monitoring and evaluation framework. The AfDB 2011 Gender
Profile for The Gambia30 provided a picture of the policies, programs and practice areas that have
promoted women’s empowerment and gender equality in the Gambia. Conclusions and
recommendations of both documents have informed the preparation of the proposed Joint
Strategy.

2.2

The Portfolios of Both Banks

58.
The current IDA portfolio (Table 5) for The Gambia comprises six active operations
(including two regional projects and one budget support operation), representing a total
commitment of US$77.75 million. The IDA portfolio is complemented by TF resources totaling
about US$36.75 million.
59.
The current AfDB portfolio (Table 6) for The Gambia consists of eight active
operations (including one regional project and one budget support operation), representing total
commitments of UA89.34 million. The AFDB portfolio includes TF commitments totaling about
UA8.4 million.
60.
The performance of both portfolios is overall satisfactory. Positive examples include
WB-supported operations in the education sector, The performance of both portfolios is overall
satisfactory. Positive examples include WB-supported operations in the education sector,
implemented by a single Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that manages all projects in the sector
and is fully integrated into the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MoBSE). Based on its
successes so far, the Gambian MoBSE has been presented as a case study in a 2012 WB research
project on Building State Capacity in Challenging Context. The MoBSE Permanent Secretary has
received an international award31 for outstanding services in the same year. In addition to their
lending program, the Banks have been engaging in a range of analytical work and technical
assistance (see Annex 3)

The International Finance Corporation (IFC)’s strategy in The Gambia is selective
and is focused on (a) enhancing the capacity of local financial institutions (through advisory
services and financing) to improve access to finance of potential Small and Medium Enterprise
(SME) clients; and (b) selectively supporting committed and experienced sponsors in priority
sectors (tourism, agriculture). IFC’s outstanding committed amount as of June 30, 2012 is US$8.5
million, including US$6.5 million in Coco Ocean, a tourism project, and US$2 million with
Ecobank Gambia. IFC's investment in Coco Ocean supports the development of a new up-scale
market niche and promotes The Gambia’s image as a quality destination, with the aim of
attracting visitors with higher purchasing power. To further strengthen the country’s banking
sector, the IFC committed two investments in Ecobank Gambia, including a US$0.3 million tier-2
investment through the IFC managed Cap Fund and a US$2 million trade finance facility under
the Global Trade Finance Program, with the latter expected to foster external trade, including for
SMEs. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has not yet issued coverage for
any investments in The Gambia.

2.3

The JPS-2 Strategic Approach

Strategy Overview
62.
The Banks’ overarching objective for the proposed JPS-2 is to support the
Government’s efforts to address major challenges in the areas of poverty reduction, job
creation and economic growth, in light of the country’s vulnerability to external shocks, and in
line with priorities outlined in PAGE 2012. The JPS-2 builds on the successful implementation of
the preceding JAS-1, and gives priority to the consolidation of progress achieved and to creating
linkages among areas of interventions in order to strengthen resilience on both the macro and
micro levels. Given the high elasticity of poverty with respect to growth, the underlying
expectation is that the promotion of growth through interventions in agriculture and rural
development will contribute significantly to poverty reduction.
63.
Governance represents a key factor for achieving the growth and service delivery
results envisioned in the Government strategy. Strengthening governance, including through a
solid and predictable policy and macro-economic framework, is critical for providing an enabling
environment for productive investments to unlock the country’s full growth potential. Similarly,
more effective and transparent management of public resources, along with enhanced human
resources capacity could support improvements in service delivery. The JPS recognizes the crosscutting role that governance plays in the two proposed pillars. In light of the considerable
governance challenges, the JPS proposes to focus on areas where progress has been recorded, i.e.
economic development with a specific focus on rural areas, and service delivery for human
development. Sector operations also will more systematically take governance into account in
their project design. The JPS also includes a dedicated governance and capacity building
operation in the outer year of its implementation period, which will further support an integrated
approach to governance and maximize development effectiveness across the two pillars.
64.
Under the proposed new JPS, the Banks would provide technical assistance and
analytical and financial support to a joint and complementary program which focuses on
the following two pillars:
JPS-2 Pillars
Pillar 1:
Enhancing Productive Capacity and Competitiveness in order to Strengthen Resilience to
External Shocks - aligned with elements of PAGE pillars I (Economic Growth), II (Infrastructure)
and IV (Governance).
Pillar 2:
Strengthening the Institutional Capacity for Economic Governance and Public Service
Delivery - aligned with elements of PAGE pillars III (Human Capital, Social Services), IV
(Governance) and V (Social Cohesion, Cross-cutting interventions).

65.
These pillars are a slightly modified version of the JAS-1 pillars reflecting a shift in
priorities given the country’s most recent exposure to external shocks which affected both the
drivers of growth and the Government’s capacity for service delivery.
66.

The approach of the JPS is to consolidate gains achieved in previous years, while
16

selectively exploring new areas of intervention in the outer years. The Gambia’s overall
development agenda has not changed fundamentally, and the resource allocation of both Banks is
limited.
67.
The principles proposed by AfDB and the WBG to guide the design of the JPS
program are as follows:









Draw on the comparative strengths of each Bank and on AfDB’s focus on economic
governance and agriculture, specifically in response to the 2011 Sahel drought crisis.
Ensure complementarity and avoid overlap, with the activities of other key donors.
Align the activities, where possible, with key institutional and regional priorities of
both Banks, including the AfDB RIAS and the WB Africa Strategy.
Given the small size of the country, regional integration will be a cross cutting theme
as it was in the previous JAS. Regional program resources will be used, where
available to leverage the national IDA and/or ADF allocations and acquire GEF cofinancing while assuring selectivity in the overall lending program.
The JPS-2 program will be very selective and focus on only few key areas of
intervention, i.e. governance/public financial management, agriculture/rural
development (both Banks in close cooperation); critical infrastructure (AfDB on
transport and WBG on energy); and service delivery in the education and health
sectors at the community level and in combination with interventions on improving
nutrition for mothers and children (WBG).
Both Banks will further deepen attention to gender throughout their lending and nonlending portfolios in line with the national Gender Policy.

68.
The proposed new strategy has been designed and will be implemented jointly by
teams from both Banks, and (partly) also with other stakeholders, to ensure maximum of
synergies in approaches and activities, as recommended by the JAS-1 Completion Report. The
proposed strategy includes a joint results matrix which – to the extent possible – specifies which
partner is undertaking which activities.
Expected Results and Program of Lending and Non-Lending Activities
Pillar 1: Enhancing Productive Capacity and Competitiveness in Order to Strengthen
Resilience to External Shocks
69.
Pillar I focuses on promoting a competitive investment climate, strengthening the
agriculture and rural development sectors, including through drought recovery measures, and
developing key supporting infrastructure, with a focus on energy and water sectors – with a view
to strengthening the economy’s resilience to external shocks including those related to climate
change and extreme weather events.
Agriculture and Rural Development: Interventions by both Banks will aim to promote
70.
more diversified and efficient production of priority agricultural commodities by both
smallholders and commercial farms. Specifically, the interventions will promote good practices
and strengthen capacities for sustainable and efficient management of the country’s water
resources. The approach will ensure that agriculture and rural development are geared towards
environmental sustainability and linked to poverty alleviation, improved food security, nutrition
and social protection – and that macro-economic policy, addressed under Pillar 2, builds the
necessary supportive framework for sustainable results in these fields of intervention.32 Support
17

will also include the generation and dissemination of adapted technology for enhanced
agricultural productivity in the context of a regional program. One additional focus will be to
create incentives for increased private sector engagement, including commercial agriculture.
71.
Rural development and agriculture under the proposed JPS will be supported by a new
IDA Commercial Agriculture and Rural Development operation (CARD, US$14 million, FY14),
complemented by the FY13 (second) Emergency Agriculture Production Project (JSDF grant,
US$3 million). The design of both operations will be informed by an Agriculture Sector Policy
Note that was prepared in 2012 in the context of the preparation of the proposed JPS. Synergies
will be created with the regional IDA West Africa Agricultural Production Program and the
ADF-supported Regional Sahel Resilience Program. Relevant AfDB projects include the GAFSP
Food Security Project to enhance food security planned for 2013; and the multinational Sahel
Resilience Project, which includes The Gambia and aims at developing measures and techniques
to counter weather variability.
72.
Production-oriented activities would be complemented by a targeted approach
towards social protection for the most vulnerable rural population through community-driven
development (CDD) activities to strengthen resilience to external shocks / adverse conditions on
the local level. A CDD component in the CARD will use social protection strategies to support
demand-driven activities on the local level related to preventing the impacts of adverse weather
conditions on agricultural production, and make provision for food security and sustained
nutritional outcomes for the most vulnerable, under-served rural poor population.33 The proposed
JPS will build on the multi-sectoral experience in nutrition and CDD from the previous JAS
period. By targeting women, promoting small-scale and diversified food production, and
expanding food and nutrition behavior change communication strategies, the WBG will support
the Government’s efforts to improve the food security and nutrition of its population.

JPS-2 Outcome 1 – Adoption of Diversified Production and Marketing of Selected Agricultural
Commodities
Outcome Indicators:


Number of additional households engaged in food diversification through small scale fruit and
vegetable production, and/or small animal husbandry (25,000 by June 2016 from 0 in 2012).

JPS-2 Outcome 2 - Adoption of improved technologies in Agriculture



Number of additional beneficiaries who have adopted technologies for enhanced agricultural
productivity and storage (120,000 by June 2016 from 0 in June 2012).
Incremental percentage increase in horticulture sales ≥ 15% in June 2015, from 0% in
September 2012 relative to baseline of GMD 3,644 in January 2011)

73.
Investment Climate: The IDA Growth and Competitiveness Project (GCP) will continue
to provide support to strengthen the competitiveness of key sectors and improve the investment
climate. The project will support activities to (a) reduce the costs and delays of starting and
operating businesses in The Gambia, including the time and costs associated with compliance
with tax regulations and (b) improve the collateral registry. These activities will foster
competition and competitiveness, while reducing an important constraint in terms of access to
18

finance for firms. Tourism is an area of focus of the project, and the revamping of the Gambia
Tourism and Hospitality Institute will help provide the necessary skills needed to run the tourism
establishments.
74.
Finally, to further ground the Government's private sector development policies, it is
important to strengthen the public-private dialogue, through the provision of technical
assistance (TA), logistical and personnel support. The newly established Gambia Investment and
Export Promotion Agency (GIEPA) is expected to improve private-public dialogue and facilitate
investment with support from the GCP. The administration of investment incentives has
reportedly improved and there are renewed efforts in investment promotion. The banking sector
continues to perform relatively well, although access to finance remains a constraint with
government borrowing crowding out the private sector. The scope for private participation in
infrastructure is promising if a clear policy and regulatory framework is put in place.
75.
The Government has expressed interest in analytical support for financial sector
strengthening, private-public partnerships, and trade logistics to complement a number of the
interventions supported under the GCP. A multi-sector study on Sources of Growth, Business
Environment and Labor Markets will spell out the main opportunities in agribusiness, mining,
tourism and urbanization and help guide the implementation of the current PAGE and the
preparation of a follow-up strategy. This piece of analytical work will also leverage and
complement the 2009 ICA. Other analytical work will include a Trade Logistics study, a
Financial Sector Development Strategy and studies on the development of critical public private
partnerships (PPPs). A request to the AfDB by the Trust Bank Gambia Ltd. for a line of credit
for on-lending to SMEs, is still awaiting a response.
76.
The JPS also proposes to prepare analytical work on Higher Education (tracer study
of higher education graduates) which could inform the Government’s first ever higher education
policy aimed at aligning human resource competencies and the labor market. IFC aims to support
vocational training schools to improve specialized professional skills among the working
population.
77.
IFC will explore how to further support private sector initiatives, especially in the
power, financial education and agribusiness sectors. To ensure that economic recovery is
inclusive and sustainable, the focus will be on promoting and engaging the local private sector,
particularly SMEs. IFC is active in developing trade with a commercial bank under its Global
Trade Finance Program that is aiming at increasing trade and SME financing. In addition to
facilitating access to credit via the banking sector, IFC will develop the capacity of SMEs to
actively participate in the supply and value chains of the large projects in the country. In this
regard, assessment activities will gauge the potential for Business Edge training programs to serve
as the SME capacity development component of the Africa Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
(AMSME) programs with financial institutions.
JPS-2 Outcome 3 – Improved Business Environment
Outcome Indicators:


78.

Cost of registering a business (<140 % of GNI/capita by June 2015, from 206.10 % in
September 2012)

Infrastructure: IFC is ready to mobilize resources to support the Government in
19

identifying bankable opportunities in the telecom, power, water, road and transport sectors. In
particular, IFC is engaging in a dialogue with The Gambia’s institutions and development
partners in order to identify PPP possibilities that might be in the best interest of the country, in
partnership with the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF).
79.
Energy: Development of the electricity sector, specifically as related to the
organizational effectiveness of NAWEC and the exploration of potential for PPPs, would be
followed up by through the implementation of the recommendations of the 2010 Energy Sector
Diagnostic Study. The WBG will support an Integrated Resource Planning Study (funded in part
through an Additional Financing grant under the IFMIS Project, and in part by the PPIAF) aimed
at reducing the NAWEC’s burden on government accounts, and prioritizing needed investments.
A more important investment in the energy sector will be provided by the WBG’s Energy Sector
Support Project (US$8 million, FY15). IFC support to any Independent Power Producer project
will be contingent to reforms of the sector and NAWEC. The AfDB is considering supporting
private-sector investments in thermal and renewable energy.
80.
Transport: The AfDB will continue supporting the Gambia on more efficient crossborder road infrastructure, specifically as related to the Trans-Gambia Bridge to Senegal that
will be critical in facilitating of cross-border trade in the sub-region. IFC has been in preliminary
discussions with AfDB regarding advisory opportunities on the Trans-Gambia bridge project.
JPS-2 Outcome 4 - Improved Cross Border Transit Time.


Reduced transit time across the Gambia River (from 79min in 2012 to <30min by 2016)



Reduced waiting time at borders (from 4 hrs in 2012 to 2 hrs by 2016)

81.
Telecommunication: The IDA West Africa Regional Communication Infrastructure
Program (WARCIP) has helped The Gambia connect directly to the new high capacity ACE
submarine cable connecting Africa with Europe. It will facilitate the introduction in The Gambia
and in the region of high speed internet services, and make telecom services more reliable and
affordable for consumers. The program is structured to address critical connectivity gaps through
(a) the establishment of infrastructure and institutional set-up for the landing of the ACE cable
and (b) TA to strengthen the enabling environment for connectivity, including the policy and
regulatory framework for open access, in close collaboration with the private sector.
JPS-2 Outcome 5 - Improved Telecommunication/Internet connectivity
Outcome Indicators:


Volume of international traffic: International Communications (Internet, Telecoms, and
Data) bandwidth per person (kbit/per person) (30kbit/person by December 2016, from
10kbit/person in September 2012)



Volume of available international capacity: International Communications (Internet,
Telecoms, and Data) bandwidth (Gbit/s) (5.9 Gbit/s by December 2016, from .16 in
September 2012)

20

Pillar 2: Strengthening the Institutional Capacity for Economic Management and Public
Service Delivery
82.
Pillar II aims at consolidating the gains reached in the 2008-2011 JAS period on
transparency and accountability in the use of public resources, improving the performance of the
civil service, improving public service delivery and quality with a focus on education, nutrition
and community health, and social protection, and making further progress in these areas
consistent with the PAGE and the MDG objectives.
83.
The main outcomes of the proposed JPS under this pillar will refer to improved
fiscal and macro-economic management, and improved service delivery in terms of improved
quality of learning outcomes for basic and secondary education, and nutrition and health
outcomes for women and children.
84.
Recent progress in economic management will be consolidated and further enhanced
during the coming JPS period. Aspects of public financial management (budget planning,
execution, reporting; public procurement, internal and external auditing; aid coordination) as well
as macroeconomic management, education sector management and the role of the private sector
with specific focus on PPPs, the energy sector, the hospitality industry and agriculture will be
covered by a series of budget support operations, determined under a Joint Budget Support
Matrix, as agreed between AfDB, IDA and the Government. The series would be split in four
operations (two by each Bank) in the overall amounts of UA3 million and US$11 million,
respectively, over 3 years.
85.
On-going institutional support and technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance
and Economy (AfDB’s second Institutional Support for Economic and Financial Governance,
ISPEFG II and IDA’s IFMIS-Project) will complement the economic governance reform
agenda. The IFMIS Project will be extended and resupplied with fresh resources through an
Additional Financing (AF) operation that would aim at further rolling out and deepening the
IFMIS modules. In particular, the IFMIS system could be upgraded to a newer web-based version
and expanded to include donor-funded projects which constitute about 40 percent of the national
budget and a link with the debt management system. Additional efforts could also be taken to
improve the demand side of public financial management by actively disseminating information
to the public and creating a general environment encouraging transparency, accountability, and
participation34. The routine publication of IFMIS-generated government fiscal operations reports
on the web will serve as a key measure to trigger demand side accountability for improved
allocative efficiency. The envisaged AF for the IFMIS Project will also support a strategic energy
study - as the energy sector represents a large off budget liability that threatens the country's
overall fiscal balance.
86.
Specifically on Public Financial Management, the WBG will work with the
Government to develop a Customs Assessment Trade Toolkit – an integrated monitoring tool to
measure customs performance over time, to ensure consistency with best practice and/or best fit,
using objectively verifiable data sets. This will provide additional analytical underpinning for a
focused engagement with the Government in the implementation of requisite policy reforms that
could lead to common and simplified customs procedures as well as strengthened regional
integration. A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment is foreseen
for FY14, and Institutional Development Fund (IDF) resources (US$0.7 million) will be
requested for the implementation of actions aimed at strengthening the Public Accounts
21

Committee (PAC) in its oversight role over the three-year period starting in mid-2013.
JPS-2 Outcome 6 – Improved Public Financial Management
Outcome Indicators:




Completion of accounts reconciliation within 30 days of the end of the month for at least 12
months in a row by end 2016.
Time needed for Public Accounts Committee’s completion of review of latest audit reports
(within 12 months of receipt from the NAO by June 2016, from >12 months in 2011).
Number of procurement organizations compliant with the Gambia Public Procurement Act, as
reflected in annual Gambia Public Procurement Agency report. (9 by end-2015, from 0 in
2012)

87.
The WBG will also collaborate closely with the European Commission (EC) to
improve governance in the Gambia, under the public financial management component of
the EU Governance Support Program approved in 2011. The WBG will prepare and
implement a technical assistance intervention funded under the EU Program, which aims at
boosting Public Procurement Reform by (a) strengthening the Gambia public procurement
institutions, (b) improving the efficiency and transparency of the country’s public procurement
system, and (c) enhancing the compliance of the national procurement system with international
quality standards. In addition, options to link activities in support of public procurement with
the IFMIS Project will be explored, as part of tackling the bigger challenges in PFM and
governance.
88.
The ongoing, incremental civil service reform will be supported through the
continued implementation of a small Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant for
technical assistance to support key components in the Government’s long term Civil Service
Reform agenda, specifically in the areas of strengthening the capacity for human resources
management, and wage bill and pension management. Building on this grant, the new JPS will
provide support to more effective service delivery through extensive capacity building and the
introduction of performance management tools in collaboration with other development partners,
notable the EU and UNDP.
89.
In addition, the WBG has agreed to resume support to statistical capacity
development for the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS) and for statistical departments in line
ministries with financial resources to be requested from the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity
Building (TFSCB). The AfDB has launched the 2011 round of the International Comparison of
Prices (ICP) Program with price data collection in 18 regional member countries, including The
Gambia, in support of and in close collaboration with GBOS.
90.
In the social sectors, support will concentrate on education, and on nutrition and
household food and nutrition security in combination with community-based health care.
91.
In education, the successful WBG support during previous years, with its strong
focus on access, will be continued under this JPS with a stronger focus on education quality.
The ongoing Education for all Fast Track Initiative Project financed by the Global Partnership for
Education (GPE), and the IDA Third Education Project (phase 2) will be completed. A follow-up
IDA Education Sector Support Project and, if possible, a new GPE Basic Education Grant, would
be prepared for FY14 to continue the reform process aimed at improving the quality of learning
22

outcomes for basic education. Complementary to these investments, a small number of very
targeted analytical work and technical assistance will help define and support certain elements of
reform, notably a Survey on Parenting Practices, an operation to develop a program for Teaching
Math and Physics through E-learning, and a National Language Pilot TA.

JPS-2 Outcome 7 – Improved quality of learning outcomes for basic education
Outcome Indicators:



% of teachers whose attendance is over 90% in 2016 by region, from 75% in 2012.
% of students reaching the minimum literacy standard on grade 3 NAT reaches 43% in 2016,
disaggregated by gender, from 36.7%, in 2012.

92.
In the area of maternal and child health, nutrition, and household food security the
WB will follow-up on the support provided to the Gambia National Nutrition Agency under
the JAS-1 with a combined IDA / TF operation focused on Community-based Nutrition and
Primary Health Care Services for maternal and child health and nutrition – in close coordination
with activities for rural and agricultural development. This operations will use Results-Based
Financing (RBF). Improved service delivery performance in primary health and community
nutrition, together with complementary measures as suggested in the 2012 Global Monitoring
Report, will strengthen household food and nutrition security resilience in the wake of external
economic shocks, thereby supporting the Government in developing more effective social
protection strategies. The AfDB is considering investment options in the health sector through
support to a private clinic in collaboration with the private sector.
Outcome 8 – Improved nutrition and health services for women and children
Outcome Indicators:




Proportion of births assisted by skilled personnel (65 percent by June 2016, from 57% in 2012)
Exclusive breastfeeding rate in the first six months (i.e., proportion of children 0-6 months
exclusively breastfed in the last 24 hours) (40 percent by June 2016, from 34% in 2012)
Prevalence of anemia in children under five (52% by June 2016, from 62% in 2012)

93.
The application of the RBF approach to the health and nutrition service delivery will
be a catalyst for improving service delivery systems by strengthening accountability systems
as a means of providing quality services to poor people. Substantial technical assistance
accompanying RBF processes will be provided, including TA for the management information
system, the external verification of results, integrated program planning and budgeting, and interagency coordination and organizational development. In addition, the WBG will work with
UNICEF to monitor household food and nutrition security through child anthropometrics. These
analytical products and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey results of 2010 will provide the
basis for policy dialogue.
23

94.
The Bank will provide technical support to help the Government Review the Social
Protection Programs (including safety nets) and define a concrete action plan for developing an
efficient system. One lesson from experience in other countries is that the most effective
approach to prepare for crises is to build elements of a safety net system that can be used in
normal times as a permanent program for vulnerable groups (for example infants, pregnant
women, the disabled) and can be scaled up to cover others in periods of crisis.
95.
Disaster Risk Preparedness: A US$660,000 grant for a Bank executed non-lending TA
project, currently under preparation, will help reduce vulnerability to disaster and foster disaster
preparedness. The team will explore options to create synergies among this activity and the
envisaged new Commercial Agriculture and Rural Development Project and the recently
approved Emergency Agricultural Production Support operation, specifically on risk mitigation
measures.
96.
The government will make an effort to build on the recently approved gender
legislation in country, to deepen the WB’s effort to ensure gender issues are built into the
projects.

2.4

Implementing the Second AfDB / WBG JPS

Financial Envelope
97.
The proposed program design is based on the assumption of a three year (2012-14)
ADF resource allocation for new commitments of UA3 million (equivalent to US$4.5
million) from ADF 12 available for 2012 and 2013 and UA 8 million (equivalent to US$12
million) from ADF 13 available for 2014 and 2015, in addition to an indicative IDA-16
allocation of SDR 29.8 million (equivalent to US$44.7 million35) followed by estimated IDA-17
annual allocations of US$14 million. This would amount to a total in combined ADF and IDA
funds over the four-year JPS period of almost US$90 million, supplemented by TF resources.
Both AfDB and IDA have been quite successful in leveraging additional resources through Trust
Funds and will continue to do so under the JPS-2. Additional resources could come from the
Global Agriculture Food Security Program (GAFSP), Rural Water Supply & Sanitation Initiative
(RWSSI), African Water Facility (AWF), IDF, GPE, GEF (specifically, on dry land agenda and
environmental stability as part of the envisaged CARP) and Bank-executed TFs for technical and
analytical work. Added to this would be allocations for regional projects, to be determined, from
both Banks.
Managing Program Implementation
98.
The JPS-2 lending program (Table 7) will be implemented by Government
implementing organization (IO) and Project Coordination Units (PCUs) or Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) with close support of the WB and AfDB teams. Due to capacity
limitations, most PCUs are still not fully mainstreamed into the respective implementing
organizations. It will be crucial to build mechanisms that would allow the transfer for knowledge
and skills related to project management in these organizations, including strategic planning,
fiduciary management, and monitoring and evaluation, on all levels.
99.
Program implementation will be continuously reviewed through annual Country
Program Performance Reviews, in addition to the close follow-up on implementation by sector
teams. Progress on the implementation of the proposed JPS will be analyzed in the course of a

Partnerships and Donor Coordination
100. The Gambia continues to be highly dependent on external development assistance.
More than 80 percent of the country’s development budget is financed by the international donor
community. In addition to the AfDB, the IMF and the WB, major development partners currently
include the Islamic Development Bank; the EU; DFID; OPEC; UNDP; IFAD; the UN agencies;
Taiwan, China; and Japan. However because of budget constraints in donor countries, external
donor assistance is expected to decline slightly over the period 2012-2015. Moreover, donors
raise concerns about respect for the constitution, the rule of law and good governance in the
country, specifically as related to the events of August 2012. The EU is considering options for an
escalation of pressure through the ongoing political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou
Agreement, which could, as a last resort, lead to a suspension of EU support under Article 96 of
that Agreement.
101. Aid harmonization is an important issue in a small country such as The Gambia.
While an overall framework for external partners’ coordination is not yet in place, the recent
introduction in The Gambia of a joint Government/donor review of budget allocations and
performance on a quarterly basis is a good step forward. The Gambia has signed the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and most external partners are aligning external assistance with
country objectives as presented in the PAGE. The preparation of this JPS has been discussed with
other partners. And a two-day donor conference in support of the implementation of the PAGE,
organized by UNDP, was held in July 2012. Close cooperation is envisaged with a number of
donors, including on fiduciary and governance issues; for example on public procurement reform
with the EU.
102. In addition to the close cooperation between AfDB and WB on the budget support
policy matrix, donor harmonization is most advanced in the education sector (Table 8). At
the pre-higher education levels, IDA and GPE (previously called EFA FTI) are the largest
partners supporting the systemic issues. WFP will continue to support school feeding with a view
of developing a home grown school feeding program. UNICEF will continue to provide support
to the child friendly school initiative. The Islamic Development Bank has recently negotiated a
US$10 million project to support bilingual education in madrassas. At the higher levels of
education, Islamic Development Bank, Kuwaiti Fund, OPEC, the Arab Bank for Economic
Development of Africa (BADEA) and Saudi Fund are supporting the construction of faculty
buildings and student dormitories for the expansion of the University of The Gambia. During the
JPS period, IDA will focus on providing strategic advice and technical assistance as required.
Efforts are also underway for close consultations and harmonization of donors supporting the
agricultural sectors under leadership of the AfDB, and including the WB, Islamic Development
Bank (IDB) and the Institute for Agricultural Development (IFAD). Joint project supervision
with other donors will be sought where interests overlap, along the lines of what is already in
place in the education sector.36 More generally, both banks will continue to work with the Gambia
and other development partners to foster donor coordination.

Monitoring and Evaluation
103. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs will be responsible for the coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the progress of the five pillars of PAGE through the
existing PAGE National Implementation Team. The overall management will be through a
National Coordination Committee that will report to the Ministerial level High Level Economic
Committee. On the Civil Society side, a pro-poor advocacy group (Pro-PAG) established by Civil
Society Organizations (CSOs) to participate in the monitoring of PRSP 2 would also participate in
monitoring PAGE implementation.
104. The WB, AfDB and others will continue to strengthen the capacity of the
semiautonomous Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS). The poverty database has been
improved through the 2010 Household Budget Survey and the 2011 Poverty Assessment - both
supported by UNDP.
105. A JPS results framework will be put in place by the WB and AfDB similar to that used
for the 2008-11 JPS, which will allow adequate review of AfDB and WB contributions toward the
development of The Gambia under the JPS-2. As to the recommendations of the JAS-1 CR, JPS
outcomes will be strictly aligned to specific interventions proposed in the JPS program. There will
be no separate JPS results monitoring foreseen by the government or non-governmental
stakeholders.
106. The Results Matrix (see Annex 1) will include a list of results and intermediate
outcomes to be monitored during the period FY12-15 based on envisaged project outcomes
and indictors, in order to ensure attribution to the work of both Banks and for which the two
institutions will be jointly held accountable. Project activities will be assessed on a regular basis,
including during regular portfolio reviews. The JPS implementation monitoring system will be
linked to the Government’s PAGE monitoring through (a) regular reporting on AfDB/WB
projects and programs (review of key performance indicators, portfolio reviews, project
completion reports), and (b) a planned mid-term evaluation of the JPS.

IV.

MANAGING RISKS

107. The program supported by the proposed JPS carries risks, including governance,
political, macroeconomic, project implementation and fiduciary risks, along with exogenous
shocks that can only be partly mitigated in collaboration with the international donor community.

3.1.

Governance Risks

108. The JPS-2 will be implemented in an environment with various governance risks.
Governance factors, such as accountability and transparency in the management of public
resources and challenges related to the political economy in the environment of projects, will be
anticipated and built into project design. However, they cannot fully be mitigated. In preparation
of the joint strategy, multi-stakeholder consultations have been conducted to enhance ownership.
The consultations have confirmed overall agreement to the proposed approach and substance of
the JPS-2 program. On the level of individual operations, both Banks have been assured of strong
Government and other stakeholder ownership, and both Banks will continue to encourage
constructive multi-stakeholder dialogue, transparency, and participation during program
implementation in order to reduce governance risks and maximize development impacts.
Internally, the Banks will apply their standard fiduciary and procurement safeguards and ensure
that all projects build in governance mitigation measures for the intended development outcomes.
Externally, in line with its mandatory Access to Information policy, the WB will proactively
disseminate information to beneficiaries and other stakeholders to increase opportunities for
citizen feedback.
109. Economic governance slippages and weak technical and managerial public sector
capacity could compromise the most effective use of scarce public resources. The JPS-2
provides for the continuation of the policy dialogue of both Banks through a series of
development policy operations (DPOs) to strengthen economic governance. Amongst others, the
DPOs support improvements in public financial management and budget planning to enhance the
quality of public spending and transparency. At the government level, the WB’s Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) project will support the Government in a
more effective management of its resources, including through the progressive integration of
donor-funded activities into the system. Together with other tools, IFMIS can thus serve as an
instrument to help improve fiscal management and transparency and mitigate governance risks. A
further extension of the scope and application of the IFMIS system will be encouraged.
110. Major policy reversals and other unexpected decisions also represent significant
risks and have undermined confidence in the Government’s commitment to its international
agreements. One recent example is the President’s intervention of October 2012 into the
jurisdiction of the Central Bank in terms of determining the country’s monetary policy through
the (temporary) introduction of a fixed exchange rate peg. This unexpected policy change
exposed the risk of possible political capture of macroeconomic policy with significant
undesirable implications37 and raised questions on the independence of the Central Bank and in
the government’s commitment to the ECF Arrangement that it had signed with the IMF earlier in
2012. Had the peg not been removed quickly, and in consequence, the IMF program been
declared off-track and even possibly suspended, the decision could have affected the approval of
much needed budget support by both Banks in the near future. Another recent example of an
unpredicted decision was the introduction of the four-day work week for the public service in
January 2013. Implications of this decision still have to be observed. Both Banks will continue
28

working closely with the IMF to reach out to the government to highlight the inadvertent
consequences of unanticipated decisions, and if need be, adjust the program accordingly.

3.2

Macroeconomic Risks

111. The Gambia is highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including commodity price
volatility and the impact of the global economic slowdown. The main risk of the economy is
erratic weather that cause crop failures either through droughts, as experienced in 2001/02 and
2011/12 that led to GDP contractions, and flooding, as experienced in more isolated areas of the
country in 2012/13 and may again lead to crop failures at present and in. Interventions especially
in agriculture will need to be designed for taking into account these risks, and identify appropriate
mitigation measures and responses.
112. The ongoing global financial crisis presents considerable risks through secondary
effects of the economic downturn on commodity prices and exports, reduced inflows from
remittances and export services, and more restricted access to finance for both the public and
private sectors. These downside risks are only partly mitigated by lower oil prices, as The Gambia
is fully import dependent on oil. Other adverse external factors include the impact of external
crisis or unfavorable climate conditions. The JPS-2, which will strengthen governance and
improve the business environment, will help the country better deal with external and internal
shocks. The Banks may consider reconfiguring the program in case of unexpected emergencies.
The team will also consider tapping into new Crisis Response Window options, if available and
necessary.
113. The domestic macroeconomic framework and policy conditions also represent
significant risks for The Gambia. Public sector domestic debt, in particular, represents a
significant risk to macroeconomic stability as (i) a high roll-over risk, since it is held entirely in
short-term maturities (one-year or less) and (2) a risk to potential GDP growth through the
crowding out domestic investment. Persistent, albeit recently shrinking, fiscal deficits also
represent an important risk to growth outturns and public sector service delivery, as resources are
diverted to debt and interest payments and by limiting fiscal space and the ability of the
government to respond in the event of crises. Sudden and nontransparent shifts in monetary policy
are disruptive to economic activity and undermine domestic and international confidence.
114. While the overall objective of the JPS-2 to support the Government’s efforts to
address challenges in the areas of poverty reduction, job creation and growth will be
affected by the impacts of the described external and internal risk factors, the proposed
program contributes to at least partially mitigating these risks. Given the vulnerability to
exogenous shocks and the volatile global environment, the IMF, IDA and AfDB will continue to
closely monitor the government’s macroeconomic performance. To date, under the IMF ECFsupported program, has been satisfactory. The PFM reforms supported by the Banks’ budget
support series and the IFMIS Project can also help enhance controls in executing the overall and
sectoral budgets.

3.3

Program Implementation and Fiduciary Risks

115. Frequent and unpredictable turnovers of Government counterparts present another
risk for program implementation. During the JAS-1 period, several Bank programs experienced
frequent turnovers of Government officials, including at the ministerial level. The resulting
29

instability and uncertainty negatively affected program execution and undermined steady
implementation. The risk of ongoing reshuffling is largely outside the control of the two Banks,
except for two approaches: (i) to emphasize the importance of continuity for project
implementation as part of the ongoing political dialogue, and (ii) to diversify and institutionalize
implementation processes as much as possible to reduce dependence on individual counterparts.
116. Institutional and individual capacity weaknesses pose a risk to effective and timely
project management, and to achieving results, which has in the recent past affected Borrower
performance ratings of projects in Implementation Completion and Results Reports. Possible
mitigation measures will, for example, include the option to embed an Immediate Response
mechanism into new projects in case they are facing critical implementation delays. Further,
implementation and fiduciary risks will be mitigated through intensive supervision from the
Washington and Dakar Offices; such supervision will complement various capacity building
activities (as part of the cross-cutting theme) to ensure substantial TA is provided to strengthen
public institutions, including implementing agencies. The JPS program will be monitored on an
annual basis and a formal JPS mid-term review will be conducted to assess progress and
determine the need for any revisions to the scale and scope of the proposed programs. Also, the
Banks will strengthen their strategic communication with country counterparts, including both
Government and key non-governmental stakeholders and other donors. Nonetheless, the residual
risk remains substantial.

Annex 3: JAS Completion Report – FY08-11
THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
JAS COMPLETION REPORT FY08-11
Country: The Gambia

Date of JAS 1: February 1, 2008

Period Covered by the JAS Completion Report: February 1, 2008 – December 31, 2011
______________________________________________________________________________
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.1
The purpose of this JAS Completion Report (CR) is to draw lessons from the design and
implementation of the outgoing JAS (2008-2011) and to provide guidance for the design and
implementation of the forthcoming JAS covering the period 2012-2015. The CR is also meant to
serve as an accountability tool for the country teams in both institutions. This introduction
presents a brief summary of the findings of the self-evaluation and the ratings under each
component. Section II presents a review of the progress made towards achieving the main
country goals; whereas Section III presents the highlights of the detailed evaluation of the
outcomes of the strategy. Section IV presents an assessment of the performance of each
institution; and finally Section V presents key lessons and suggestions for the forthcoming JAS
(2012-2015).
1.2
The design of the 2008 JAS was aligned with the PRSP II, and focused on two pillars:
(i) Strengthening the institutional framework for economic management and public service
delivery, with three components including sub-components, and altogether nine outcomes, and
(ii) Enhancing productive capacity and accelerating growth and competitiveness, with four
components and additional eight outcomes. Pillar (i) was definitely the pillar with the stronger
weight in terms of resource allocation, number of interventions, and attention throughout most of
the JAS period (see details in Annex 3, Table (1), pp. 70ff). Following the JAS mid-term review
in 2010 and as laid out in the 2010 JAS Progress Report, the JAS Results framework was
somewhat straightened and adjusted to implementation reality, notably through the removal of
sub-components and the dropping and/or replacement of outcomes (and related indicators) that
were not relevant anymore, and the reduction in the number of outcomes from 17 to 14.
1.3
Progress towards the JAS (2008-2011) implementation has overall been moderately
satisfactory as it achieved good progress toward all major expected outcomes. Under pillar (i)
progress is rated overall satisfactory: Interventions by both Banks contributed towards
macroeconomic and fiscal stabilization through budget support and the institutional support
projects. Major achievements in this area included reforms in the legislative framework for
budget management and public procurement and the rolling out of the Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS) in January 2011. There has also been progress – albeit
moderate – in the civil service reform and in strengthening the national statistical system and the
audit function. Progress under pillar (ii) has been moderately satisfactory. The JAS contribution
to improving the investment climate has been positive. Intervention for the improvement of crop
productivity and increased output of fisheries has been impressive, particularly with respect of
36

groundnuts and rice, up to the onset of the 2011 Sahel drought. However, extension of credit to
smallholder farmers for the financing of agricultural inputs has been confronted with managerial
problems and low recovery rates, and access to financial resources by MSNEs has been limited.
1.4
Performance by both institutions in the design and implementation of the JAS has
overall been satisfactory. In the design of the joint strategy, the two partners pursued strategic
selectivity and complementarity in their respective interventions and both institutions have
supported their respective interventions with joint and separate non-lending activities (AAA),
which are of relevance to the portfolio in support of the JAS and both institutions have been
proactive in adjusting the JAS to changing circumstances during the Progress Report exercise.
Both institutions delivered both the lending and non-lending activities, with adjustments to the
changing country circumstances during the JAS implementation.

PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING COUNTRY LEVEL GOALS

2.1
The Gambia’s long-term strategic goals were articulated in its Vision 2020, which
aimed “…to transform The Gambia into a financial center, a tourist paradise, a trading export
oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation, thriving on free market policies and a vibrant
private sector, sustained by a well-educated, skilled, healthy, self-reliant and enterprising
population, guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a descent standard of living for all,
under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry”. The current Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II 2007-2011), which is the second in a series of PRSPs1, is
based on Vision 2020 and on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
2.2
PRSP II has five pillars: (i) Create an enabling policy environment to promote growth
and poverty reduction; (ii) Enhance the capacity and output of productive sectors: agriculture,
fisheries, industry, trade and tourism, with emphasis on productive capacities of the poor and
vulnerable populations; (iii) Improve coverage of the basic social services and social protection
needs of the poor and vulnerable; (iv) Enhance governance systems and build the capacity of
local communities and civil society organizations (CSOs) to play an active role in economic
growth and poverty reduction; and (v) Mainstreaming poverty related cross-cutting issues into
poverty reduction.
2.3

The overall implementation of the PRSP II (2007-2011) has been mixed.


1

Regarding the first pillar, while the target for economic growth has been attained, fiscal
deficit and mounting public indebtedness continue to pose a serious challenge. The
policy and institutional reforms introduced since 2005 partly contributed to the relatively
high GDP growth, which averaged a remarkable 6.2 percent during the period 2008-10 despite the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 - up from an average of 1.3 percent
during the preceding 3 years. In 2011, however, the sources of growth in The Gambia
shifted with the onset of the 2011/2012 drought, which led to a sharp contraction in crop

production. The revival in tourism activity in the same year helped to partly offset the
crop failure and was supported by The Gambian’s tourist industry capturing some of the
shift in market shares due to the Arab Spring. Greater fiscal and monetary discipline
contributed to maintaining consumer price inflation for 2011 at below 4.5 percent, down
from 5.8 percent in 2010. However, fiscal deficit has been on the rise since 2008,
reflecting both overspending and public revenue shortfalls. The basic fiscal balance 2
deteriorated from a surplus of about 3 percent of GDP in 2007 to a deficit estimated at 3.3
percent in 2010 and a projected deficit of 2.3 percent in 2012. The country continues to
be debt-distressed 3 in spite of the HIPC relief since reaching Completion Point in
December 2007 and the subsequent debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI). The total debt outstanding as a ratio to GDP declined from 143.2
percent in 2006 (pre-HIPC) to 55.1 percent in 2008 but it increased again to 68.4 percent
in 2011.


Regarding the second pillar, there are proof that indicate the productive capacities of
vulnerable population, particularly smallholder farmers, has generally improved with
favorable weather conditions and the pricing and marketing reforms within the
groundnuts sub-sector and the introduction of improved rice (NERICA). The agricultural
sector has witnessed substantial growth in recent years (until the onset of the 2011
drought) mainly due to favorable weather conditions and strong support by the
development partners. Nevertheless it continues to be constrained by serious problems,
which include: (i) accessibility of farmers to timely inputs and credit; (ii) increased
agricultural productivity will be dependent on reducing the number of people currently
(under) employed in agriculture, by generating more off-farm employment; (iii)
weaknesses in forward linkages for creating value added through agro-processing; (iv)
excessive losses in post-harvest handling and storage and adverse weather conditions.



Regarding the third pillar, the 2010 MDG Status Report concludes that there has been
progress in the area of universal primary education, and in the ratio of girls to boys in
primary, secondary and tertiary education. But there is still a wide gap between PRSP
and MDG targets and the current status. The country’s health indicators remain
relatively good compared with other Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Infant mortality rates
and under-five mortality rates are at par with the best in the Region. There has been less
progress in the under-5 mortality rate and insufficient progress in maternal health and in
combating HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases.



Under the fourth pillar, progress in enhancing governance systems and building capacity
in local communities has been limited.

grants and external borrowing.
3
Thanks to improvements in its CPIA rating, The Gambia has been upgraded to a medium performer, with higher policy
thresholds for the assessment of the sustainability of its debt. This, and the inclusion of re-exports, has resulted in a decrease in
the risk of debt distress, from high to medium in 2012.

III.

Under the fifth pillar, recent estimates (2011) indicate that poverty had declined
substantially from 58.0 percent (using the US$1.00 a day poverty line) in 20034 to 48.4
percent (upper poverty line: US$1.25 a day)5.
EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

The JAS within The Gambia’s PRSP (2008-2011)
3.1 The joint strategy has had a positive contribution on the Government’s PRSP over
2008-2011. The major areas, where the two institutions had positive impact were in public
finance management, agricultural development, basic education, health, and water and sanitation.
The strategy’s objectives in developing the energy sector and in improving the business
environment, however, have fallen short of the planned outcomes.
3.2 The JAS, through budgetary support, technical assistance, and project investments
contributed to robust economic growth and stable macroeconomic economic environment,
which prevailed during 2008-2011. The strategy in particular focused on improving financial
transparency and accountability in the use of public resources through institutional reforms in the
areas of budgeting, public revenue mobilization, public procurement, and civil service reform.
The strategy also involved the implementation of IFMIS, which was completed by the end of
2011, and continued to provide staff training in the use of the system. Both institutions provided
technical assistance and institutional support to bridge the eight years external auditing backlog
existing in 2008 and have provided substantial capacity building in external and internal
auditing. An important output of the strategy intervention was the preparation of a
comprehensive PFM reform strategy (2010-2014), which is currently being up-dated.
3.3 The strategy also had substantial positive impact within the agricultural sector, which
is estimated to have grown by an average 18 percent annually during most of the JAS period.
Most of this growth has been partly attributable to favorable weather conditions and to policy
and institutional reforms within the groundnuts sub-sector, which have been supported by the
joint strategy. Direct project investments in the introduction and dissemination of NARICA rice,
support of artisanal fisheries, and integrated rural development projects have substantially
increased output of both cash and subsistence crops and has contributed to reduced poverty,
improved health and nutritional standards.
3.4 Interventions by both institutions were expected to have contributed to improved
public service delivery in education, health, water and sanitation, and the energy sector.
Whereas achievements related to improved access to basic education were substantial, the impact
of interventions within the health sector has been mainly related to improving nutritional

standards through support to the policy and strategic framework for nutrition and the provision of
technical assistance for the strengthening of the National Nutrition Agency (NaNA).
3.5 The joint strategy has had negligible direct impact on the water and sanitation sector
during 2008-2011, as there has been no direct project investment within the sector by either
institution. With AfDB support, a technical study to assist in the formulation of a national water
sector reform program has been initiated, and implementation of a new Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Project started by mid-2012. The initial outcomes related to improved effectiveness of
the energy sector and respective indicators were dropped following the mid-term review, since
investments and/or technical assistance by either partner have not come forward in view of
financial and institutional weaknesses of the National Water and Electricity Company (NaWEC).
The initial strategic approach was replaced by a modified new outcome, aiming foremost at
reaching an agreement with the government on priority reforms needed. An Electricity Sector
Reform Note has been prepared, and will be followed up under the new JPS.
3.6 The strategy’s objective of promoting a competitive investment climate has been
achieved moderately, so far, and facilitating access to financial resources by SME’s has not
been attained. The WB’s Doing Business Indicators reveal that the country’s ranking has
actually deteriorated in recent years. The IDA Growth and Competitiveness Project (approved in
late 2010) aims at improving investment climate and strengthen competitiveness in key sectors,
with mixed results so far despite moving forward on a promising track. The Gambia component
of the IDA West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Project has successfully
connected The Gambia to the African Coast to Europe submarine communication cable. The
AfDB regional The Gambia River Bridge Project will improve the country’s comparative
advantage as a regional hub for transit trade and promote tourism.
3.7

The following is a more detailed review of progress made on the two JAS pillars.

Pillar #1: Strengthening the Institutional Framework for Economic Management
and Public Service Delivery
3.8
There were three components with initially nine and finally eight outcomes under the first
pillar (one outcome, on provision of electricity, was dropped following the 2010 JAS mid-term
review): (i) Improving the transparency and accountability in the use of public resources (three
outcomes); (ii) Improving civil service (one outcome); and (iii) Improving public service
delivery in education, health and sanitation, and rural electrification (initially five and finally
four outcomes).
Component #1: Improving Transparency and Accountability in the use of Public
Resources
3. 9

Outcome #1 Strengthened public financial management. Overall progress under this

40

outcome has been partly achieved / moderately satisfactory6, as reflected in the findings of the
2010 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the 2011 Public Expenditure
Review (PER) Update, and the improved CPIA ratings. With support from both Banks, the
Government has been making strides in improving its public financial management and
transparency, benefitting from major reforms, which included updating the legislative framework
for budget management and public procurement including a Public Financial Management
Reforms Comprehensive Strategy for the period of 2010 to 2014. One key achievement has been
the establishment of an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). This
system has improved the timeliness of financial reporting by providing monthly and
comprehensive within-year budget execution reports and facilitating the preparation of the
annual financial statements.7 In particular, the IFMIS system has permitted the closer control of
the status of budget execution and of spending levels; an enhanced management of ministerial
resources due to the access to real time information on the status of their budgets; a strengthened
sectoral allocation, planning, and analysis; and greater effectiveness in Government expenditure
programs by identifying cost-drivers in program activities. An IFMIS interface at the Central
Bank has been established, ensuring real-time information on budget financing shortfalls and on
the timing of needed public domestic borrowing, and efforts are being made to regularize the
Human Resource records of central government employees on the IFMIS payroll. Meanwhile,
the Gambia has also reduced the backlog of audited Government financial statements 8 ,
established a Tax Tribunal, and strengthened the internal audit function.
3.10 Outcome #1: Strengthened Public Financial Management, the results have been very
encouraging and are rated partly achieved/ moderately satisfactory, specifically due to the
slow progress in the field of budget management. The Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA)
implemented a three-year Strategic Plan (2008-2010) to up-grade staff performance and has set
specific targets for tax collection and audit of large taxpayers. In 2009 GRA installed a new tax
administration IT for processing large taxpayers. And GRA has now an activity based budgeting
system in place that is linked to its mandate of collecting revenues. Further, a revised Customs
and Excise Act was enacted in April 2010. The Customs regulations have been developed, with
comments from extensive reviews waiting to be incorporated, at the time of the writing of this
document. To improve public procurement, the government has up-dated the Action Plan (20112016) to upgrade procurement practices agreed upon in the 2005 Country Procurement Issues
Paper (CPIP) Action Plan. The first priority in this area is to separate the policy and regularity
functions of the Gambia Public Procurement Authority (GPPA). Progress on the Action Plan,
however, has been slow in view of capacity and financial constraints.
3.11 Progress on budget management has been mixed: Semi-annual fiscal budget reports and
monthly budget outturns are being published since 2010 and these have recently being integrated
into IFMIS. Key PRSP public expenditures (education, health & social welfare) have since 2008

6 The rating of outcomes follows both WB and AfDB rules: Whereas the WB rules allow for 4 categories of outcome ratings
(achieved, partially achieved, not achieved, and not observable), AfDB ratings are covering a 6 point scale (highly satisfactory,
satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory and highly unsatisfactory).
7
The IFMIS currently produces in-year fiscal reports with an average lag of one month and reconciles most banking and fiscal
records also on a monthly basis.
8
The Government financial statements for 2008, 2009, and 2010 have been submitted to the National Audit Office.

41

been in line with the planned targets. However, there were considerable deviations in critical
sectors relevant for the country’s development agenda – ranging from 9 percent (forestry) to 47
percent (energy) - between initial allocations and actual expenditure for 2011, which is clearly
not satisfactory. A comprehensive MTEF is now anticipated to be introduced by 2013. The
government has requested technical assistance from the IMF in this regard.
3.12 The main instrument of support towards attaining this outcome has been the two budget
support operations9 , which supported policy and institutional reforms in macroeconomic and
public finance management, civil service reform, and the groundnuts sub-sector. The two
institutional support operations: IDA’s CBEMP and AfDB’s ISPEFG were designed to
complement the budget support programs and covered the same areas of coverage as the budget
support. The former has mainly supported the establishment and initial roll-out of IFMIS;
whereas the latter has provided technical assistance for the drawing up of the Public Financial
Management Reforms Comprehensive Strategy (2010-14). Non-lending operations by both
Banks also contributed towards attaining the outcomes. These included the CFAA exercise
(WB/AfDB and DFID) and the WB’s: Poverty Assessment Study, PER, procurement support
TA, and Anti-money Laundering.
3.13 The sustainability of the gains attained under this category is at risk, however. This is
particularly so in the case of IFMIS, whose sustainability would require further development,
maintenance and capacity building. To mitigate such risk the government has prepared an IFMIS
Sustainability Plan, and the needed costs were included in the 2009-2011 budget. A Follow-up
IDA IFMIS grant (US$ 5.2 million) was approved in June 2010, and an Additional Financing
will be included into the upcoming new JPS.
3.14 Outcome #2: Strengthened National Statistics System: The main objective of support is to
build capacity to process and disseminate key findings from national surveys within one year of
data collection. Progress towards this goal has been partly achieved / moderately satisfactory.
Most of the support in this area has been through the WB’s CBEMP and technical assistance to
the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS), which supported the transformation of the previous
Central Statistics Department into the GBOS, with greater autonomy. The national accounts data
based on a new methodology were disseminated using IFMIS and NAO web-based information
system by end-2009. Financial reporting by GBOS has also improved with the broad application
of IFMIS and the monthly publication of the cost price indices. There is little progress, however,
in the timely publication (within one year of data collection) of data, specifically national
surveys, on the GBOS’s web-site; the results of the 2010 Integrated Household Survey have been
made publicly available through the GBOS website only in early 2012.
3.15 Outcome #3: Strengthened Audit Function: Progress in strengthening audit has been
partly achieved / moderately satisfactory. The 8-year backlog of unaudited public accounts,
which existed in 2008, was cleared, which is a huge accomplishment. But the timing of
production and dissemination of audit reports has still not fully met the expectations:
Government Financial Statements from 2008-2010 were submitted to the National Audit Office

for auditing only in May/June 2012, which exceeds the benchmark of one year following the end
of the respective fiscal year. The 2011 Statements have been submitted on 20th December 2012.
The AfDB’s ISPEFG was the main vehicle of support in capacity building since 2009; the
recently approved ISPEFG II involves capacity building and institutional strengthening in
internal and external audit.
Component #2 Improving Civil Service
3.16 Outcome #4: Enhanced HR Management Policy and Tools used In Public
Administration: The planned outcome involves the establishment and use of an enhanced human
resources management policy and tools in public administration. Performance under this
component has overall been partially achieved / moderately satisfactory. A joint WB, AfDB
and DfID study on Civil Service Reform formed the basis of the formulation of the government’s
2008-2011 Civil Service Reform Strategy, approved by the Cabinet in mid-2009. The strategy
envisages key reforms related to civil service salaries and performance evaluation systems. In
implementing the strategy, the government increased civil service salaries by about 40 percent
over 2008-09, which has helped in attracting and retaining competent staff at the higher levels of
government. In order to facilitate decision-making, a Pay and Employment Model (basically a
sensitivity analysis on the immediate fiscal impacts of the changes in pay and employment
structures) was prepared with support from the WB. The full success of the measure, however,
has been constrained by the reduced fiscal space available to government to apply the originally
designed pay reform (increase of 68 percent). Integration of the HR information system with the
payroll is ongoing. An Institutional Development Fund for Civil Service Reform grant was made
available during the JAS period to support key components in the government’s long term Civil
Service Reform agenda, specifically in the areas of strengthening the capacity for human
resources management, wage bill and pension management. Development of an effective
performance appraisal tools is in the final stages, and will be piloted in The Ministries of
Tourism, and Youth & Sports. Further activities are ongoing and include the addition of an HR
Module in IFMIS to improve budget reporting, which is currently envisaged as one of the new
activities to be financed under IFMIS AF.
Component #3: Improving Public Service Delivery in Education, Health and
Sanitation and Rural Electrification
(a) Education
3.17 Outcome # 5: Increased Primary Enrollment: Performance towards increased primary
enrollment has been partially achieved/moderately satisfactory with the objectives for the JAS
period. The Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) for lower basic education increased considerably and
has reached 90 percent in 2012 (including certified madrassas following the regular curriculum).
Gender parity has been met at both the lower basic and upper basic levels - helped by
construction and rehabilitation of classrooms, separate latrines, as well as scholarships for needy
girls provided under the IDA and EFA-FTI (Education for All – Fast Track Initiative, now:
Global Program for Education, GPE) projects. Issues of hard to reach populations need to be
given focused attention during the implementation of the upcoming JPS. The JAS indicator
target of 100 percent primary enrollment, however, was not achieved.
43

3.18 Outcome #6 Increased Quality of Education: Expected progress has been partly
achieved / moderately satisfactory: Internal efficiency is quite good in comparison with other
countries, with a primary completion rate of 72 percent which is exceeding the JAS target of 68
percent for the primary completion rate. However the target of 30 percent of beneficiaries of the
in-service training program to obtain credits in English and math could not be achieved. Among
the total of 2,730 beneficiaries, only about 20 percent, i.e. 484, took the English, and only 5
percent, i.e. 140) the Math WASSCE, respectively, in September 2012. The results are expected
in February 2013, but even in the best of all possible cases, the target of 30 percent will not be
achieved.
3.19 The WB support of basic education has been through the Third Education Project (Phase
2) complemented by PHRD co-financing and Additional Financing. The latter introduced
interventions on higher education and teachers training. Further, the WB has also contributed to
improved enrollment and quality of primary education through supervision of the Education for
All-Fast Track Initiative project and various non-lending operations. The AfDB supported the
sector through a Basic Education Project, which was completed in June 2010.
(b) Health
3.20 Outcome #7: Strengthened Policy Framework for Nutrition Programs: The original
planned outcome: “Increased number of households with access to basic health services.” was
replaced at mid-point by: “Strengthened policy framework for nutritional programs.” Expected
progress towards this outcome has been achieved / satisfactory: A new Nutritional Policy
(2010-2020) has been formulated and validated in January 2011 and a costed Strategic Plan for
Nutrition (2011-2015) has been elaborated. The policy and strategic plan have been presented in
early 2012. There has been little direct support to the general health sector by both the AfDB and
the WB. The AfDB Health Services Development Project was completed in 2007. The project
may have had an impact, but it is not feasible to gauge it. The WB’s CDDP has financed 4-5
health sub-projects; but health projects generally have not been selected by the beneficiary
communities in this demand-driven project. The health sector may also have benefited indirectly
from the budget support operations provided by both the WB and the AfDB 10 . To improve
nutritional standards the WB approved in September 2010, the Rapid Response Nutrition
Security Improvement Project, alongside a two year complementary Technical Assistance
intervention to strengthen the National Nutrition Agency’s (NaNA) capacity to improve nutrition
outcomes (December 2009).
(c) Water and Sanitation
3.21 Outcome #8: Increased access to Water and Sanitation: The original planned outcome
“Increased number of water and sanitation connections in the Greater Banjul Area (GBA was
recast and replaced by “Increased access to water and sanitation”, following the 2010 JAS mid-

Response (AFCR).

term review, with a view to monitor progress of new connections across the whole country,
rather than focusing exclusively on the GBA. There has been no direct investment in the sector
by either institution during the JAS period. Hence, the achievement of the target towards this
outcome, of more than 100,000 people benefitting from additional water and sanitation
connections, as established in the JAS Progress Report, cannot be observed. The AfDB in
preparation for future operations within the sector approved in 2010 a National Water Sector
Reform Study to support the formulation of a National Water Sector Reform Program. Further
progress in this regard is anticipated through the currently ongoing AfDB Water Supply and
Sanitation Project11, approved in February 2012.
(d) Provision of Electricity
3.22 Outcome #9: Increased number of Households with access to electricity in targeted areas:
The original planned outcome towards this goal was: “Increased number of households with
access to electricity in targeted areas, and cannot be observed, since envisaged interventions
towards this objective did not materialize. Following the mid-term review, new outcomes for
energy sector support were included under pillar 2.
JAS Pillar (2): Enhancing Productive Capacity and Accelerating Growth and
Competitiveness.
3.23 The second pillar under the original JAS involved four components and eight planned
outcomes. The four original components were: (i) Promoting a Competitive Investment
Climate/Growth and Competitiveness (3 outcomes); (ii) Facilitating Access to Financial
Resources by MSMEs; (one outcome); (iii) Strengthening the Agricultural Sector (two
outcomes); and (iv) enabling the environment of the Energy Sector (two outcomes). Following
the mid-term review, three of the original components remained the same; the third component,
however, has been expanded to read: “Strengthening the Agricultural Sector and Rural
Development.” The number of expected outcomes was reduced from eight to four with three of
the four original outcomes being reformulated. Pillar (2) has proven to be more difficult to assess
than pillar (1) in view of the lack of available baseline information and data collection problems,
except for agriculture. Thus, assessment at the end of the JAS period is based on general trends.
In cases where the linkage between the planned outcomes and outputs is weak, changes have
been introduced in the outcomes.
Component #1: Promoting a Competitive Investment Climate/Growth and
Competitiveness
3.24 Outcome #10: The three original planned outcomes: “Increased number of tourists,”
“increased volume of agribusiness exports,” and “increased credit to private sector,” were
replaced by a single outcome: “Improved business climate” because of lack of credible
indicators, measured by revised indicators, i.e.“monetary value of new private investment

45

attracted in JAS period through GIPFZA12 (since 2008)” with a target value of US$55 million,
and “Time and cost of new company registration” (targets: 20 days at cost of not more than 190
percent of per capita income, down from 215 percent at mid-term). Program performance overall
is promising and progress is partially been achieved/moderately satisfactory. Progress in
terms of value of new private investment (actual investments) through GIEPA has surpassed the
target: In addition to investments of US$ 30 million in 200813, GIEPA received in 2010 seven
new private sector investment proposals with a total proposed investment value of about US$
30.4 million14. Corresponding figures for 2011 were 13 investment proposals the value of which
stood at US$ 60.0 million. The 2013 Doing Business Report indicators, however, show that the
time required for registering a business was still 27 days, in contrast to 34 days for sub-Sahara
Africa, whereas the cost of business registration (158.7 percent of per capita income) by far
exceeded that of sub-Sahara (67.3 percent), but still met the very conservative target value.
Doing Business Indicators depict that the country’s rank for doing business has slightly
improved from 149 in 2012 to 147 in 2013.
3.25 In support of this component the WB approved in September 2010 the Growth and
Competitiveness Project with its primary objective to improve investment climate and strengthen
competitiveness of key sectors in the economy. The project involves improving business
environment through business registration and tax administration reforms and the strengthening
of MSMEs through access to finance, marketing, and skills promotion in key sectors of the
economy (horticulture, groundnuts, tourism, etc.). In addition, the WB implemented a small
Trust Fund operation to create small enterprises for the development and distribution of fuel
efficient stoves and biomass briquettes.
3.26 Two other regional operations were approved, one by the WB and the other by the AfDB,
which will have a positive impact on economic growth and competitiveness, in the long run. The
IDA-funded West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure (approved in March 2011)
aims at connecting 23 countries to the Africa Coast to Europe submarine cable, and has
established a landing station with private sector involvement in The Gambia. The AfDB
combined resources from the regional allocation and the ADF for the financing of “Gambia
River Bridge Project” (approved in September 2011). The bridge constitutes the key component
for the Trans-Gambia Road Transport Corridor, which is an economic and strategic link
connecting the northern and southern parts of both The Gambia and Senegal, and with this, other
ECOWAS countries through the corridor between Dakar and Lagos. The AfDB’s planned
“Private Sector Profile Study” has not been undertaken.
Component (2) Facilitating Access to Financial Resources by SMEs
3.27 Outcome #11: The original outcome: “Improved access to finance” has been
reformulated to: “Improved access to finance for MSMEs” and the indicator has been changed

to: “Number of (direct) clients served through microfinance components of EPMDP and IFC
support” with a target of 10,000. Overall, expected results have not been achieved, and progress
has been unsatisfactory as there has been limited progress in microfinance and almost no
progress at all in SME finance. The AfDB’s Entrepreneurship Promotion and Microfinance
Development Project (EPMDP) over 2009-2011 extended about GMD2 million15 to 567 smallholders for the financing of agricultural inputs. The IFC aims to improve access to finance
through microfinance institutions and trade finance through local banks. Estimates by the Central
Bank put the number of microfinance clients at the end of 2009 at 158,000, compared to 144,500
at the end of 2008 and 129,000 at the end of 2007, but attribution to IFC interventions could not
be established. Total loans outstanding increased from GMD 233 million at end of 2007 to GMD
271 million at end of 2009.
Component (3) Strengthening the Agricultural & Rural Development Sector.
3.28 Outcome #12: The original outcome: “Improved productivity of crops, livestock, and
forestry” has been recast to: “Improved productivity of crops and livestock production and
fishery.” Progress under this outcome has overall been achieved/ satisfactory to the most part,
mainly due to the strong support to the sector by both Banks and the good weather conditions
which prevailed during the period under review until the onset of the 2011 Sahel drought.
Groundnuts output increased from 110,000 MT in 2008 to 122,000 MT and 138,000 MT in the
subsequent two years. Paddy rice over the same period increased from 11,400 MT in 2008 to
61,000 MT in 2010. Rice has benefited from the widespread adoption by farmers of the new
NARICA variety, introduced through the AfDB’s regional NARICA Rice Development Project.
Groundnuts also benefited from the marketing and pricing policy reforms of the two budget
support operations and by IDA’s Gateway Project. There has been, however, limited progress in
the livestock and forestry improvements to date. Fish output increased from 46,000 tons to about
50,000 tons over 2008-2010. The AfDB in 2009 approved an NTF supplementary Artisanal
Fisheries Development Project16, which involved improvement of fisheries infrastructure and
facilities; strengthening of the fisheries department; monitoring and control and a credit program.
3.29 The AfDB had seven ongoing agricultural operations at the start of the JAS in 2008: (i)
Farmer Managed Rice; (ii) NERICA Dissemination;(iii) Peri-Urban Agricultural Development;
(iv) Artisanal Fisheries Development; (v) Participatory Integrated Water Shed; (vi)
Entrepreneurship Promotion & Microfinance; and (vii) Community Skills Improvement. Of
these seven operations, only the Supplementary Artisanal Fisheries Development and NARICA
Dissemination are still on-going. Two new projects were approved during the JAS period; these
are: The Livestock and Horticulture Development Project and the Sustainable Land Management
Project. The IDA portfolio had one ongoing operation covering rural development including the
agricultural sector at the start of the JAS, the CDDP. Three new projects were approved by the
WB in the course of the JAS: The West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program complements
AfDB’s NERICA Rice Project through the establishment of regional centers of excellence in
agricultural research centered on new crop varieties and regional dissemination of new

technologies. The Gambia Emergency Agriculture Production Project was approved in January
2010 with resources from the Global Food Crisis Response Trust Fund. Its main objective was to
improve access to agricultural inputs, equipment, and postharvest storage capacity by targeted
farmers. Outputs by far surpassed the envisaged targets by far: As to WB project monitoring
reports, more than 60,000 farmers had received improved seeds and recommended fertilizer by
early 2011 (as compared to the initial target of 20,000), and 870 farmer groups received farm
machineries (as compared to 667 initially expected). The number of beneficiaries of pesticide
distribution could not be established. The GEF-funded Integrated Biodiversity Management
Project was approved in December 2010. Its main objective was in support of the MDG
environmental sustainability goal.
3.30 Outcome #13: Improved prevention and locust early waning reaction: Progress in
improving prevention and early warning of locusts’ infestations has been achieved/ satisfactory,
as the WB’s regional Locust Project established facilities, which reduced response time from 30
to an estimated one day.
Component (4): Enabling the Environment for Development of the Energy Sector.
3.31 Outcome # 14: Intervention for reform of Electricity Sector agreed with Government.
This outcome has replaced the original two outcomes: “Secure funding for investments identified
in new Electricity Master Plan” and “PURA applies new tariff”. Progress under this outcome
has been moderately unsatisfactory. Private sector investments within the electricity sector
have not materialized mainly due to concerns related to the effectiveness and efficiency of the
National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC) and its lack of ability to undertake much
needed internal reforms, and to assure revenues needed for investments aimed at reducing
transmission and distribution losses.
IV.

INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Design of the Strategy

4.1
The strategy design has been satisfactory as it focused narrowly on two of the five
pillars of the PRSP II: (i) strengthening the institutional framework for economic management
and public service delivery, and (ii) enhancing productive capacity and accelerating growth and
competitiveness. Given IDA’s and AfDB’s concessional resource constraint, as well as the
country’s limited absorptive capacity, the original JAS program focused on mainly four areas17:
(i) policy reforms and institutional support; (ii) agriculture and rural development; (iii) water and
sanitation; and (iv) private sector development. In this respect the JAS avoided committing fresh
funds, where other development partners were already engaged, or where there are on-going
operations, such as health, nutrition, telecommunication, power generation, and transport.
4.2
In selecting the areas of engagement and instruments, the strategy addressed
priority needs for promoting sustainable poverty-alleviation growth. The first pillar was

48

relevant to the PRSP II so as to prepare the way for sustainable growth; it also complemented the
IMF’s efforts in restoring macroeconomic stability and laid the foundations for improved
financial management. The first pillar also included operations (mostly ongoing) to improve
public service delivery in health, education and water and sanitation standards.
4.3
The second pillar is also relevant to the country’s PRSP II as it focused on accelerating
poverty-reduction growth through enhancing agricultural yields and improving the business
environment. The second pillar complemented the first pillar as it addressed issues related to
poverty alleviation through improved accessibility to credit for micro, small, and medium
enterprises (MSMEs).
4.4
The JAS recognized that some of the outcome indicators do not exist and used
milestones and other general indicators as proxy to outcomes. Some outcome indicators had
to be reformulated following the JAS mid-term review, because of little direct support in the
respective sectors.
4.5
Several of the identified critical risks have materialized. The risk pertaining to the
vulnerability of the economy to external shocks has materialized by the sharp increase in the
prices of food and energy in the 1980s, and subsequently by the global financial crisis, which
adversely affected tourism and remittances. The risk relating to the deterioration of the
macroeconomic position has also materialized in view of the increased public expenditure,
increased domestic borrowing, and the relative decline in public revenues (2.4-2.5). Risks
relating to governance, shortage in absorptive capacity and relatively week project
implementation continue to pose risks to sustained growth and development.
4.6
Both banks have been proactive in adjusting the JAS to changing circumstances and
priorities. The AfDB responded to the sharp increase in food and fuel prices in 2008 by
increasing the amount it had allocated for budget support (US $ 4.5 million) by 30percent to help
the country in absorbing the increase in the international prices of food and fuel. Also in
response to the food crisis, the AfDB restructured two ongoing agricultural operations18 with the
objective of increasing food production. At the request of the government, the AfDB has also
financed the Gambia Bridge Project (Regional). The WB, in reacting to the potential adverse
impact of food shortages approved the Emergency Agricultural Development Project. Following
the mid-term review, the WB shifted emphasis from the general health sector to improving
nutrition security. In this respect the WB initiated a Rapid Social Response Operation on
nutrition and complemented it with a Technical Assistance project. The AfDB opted to assist the
country in the formulation of a national water sector reform program prior to investment in the
sector. The outcome matrix following the mid-term review has been adjusted to reflect changing
circumstances. The changes involved the reduction in the number of the planned outcomes from
seventeen to thirteen and the adjustment in four of the remaining outcomes.

Program Implementation
4.7
The Banks’ overall program implementation has been satisfactory. Both Banks have
delivered the planned lending and non-lending activities although there have been some
modifications to adapt to changing country conditions and needs. In terms of analytical and
advisory activities (AAA), the following activities were delivered: (i) in support of strengthened
public financial management the following activities were undertaken: (i) the CFAA exercise
(AfDB/WB/DFID); (ii) Public Expenditure Review (WB); (iii) Procurement Support TA (WB);
(iv) ROSC with focus on auditing and accounting; (v) Poverty Assessment. In the area of Civil
Service Reform the following studies and TA were provided: (i) Civil Service Reform Study
(AfDB/WB/DFID); (ii) Pay and Employment Model (WB); (ii) in support of governance the
AfDB carried out a Governance Profile and a Gender Profile, whereas the WB provided TA in
Anti-Money Laundering. In support of the national statistical system the WB provided TA for
the Transformation of the Central Statistics Department into GBOS. In support of its portfolio in
the education sector the WB undertook the following: (i) Multi-Grade Reading Initiative; (ii)
Reaching out-of-school children & Building Skills for youth Employment Study; (iii) Education
Country Status Report Light; (iii) in support of its operations within the health sector, the WB
provided TA for the National Nutrition Agency (NaNA) and in support of the agricultural sector
it carried out a CDDP Impact Evaluation and an Agricultural Sector Policy Note. Within the
infrastructure sector, the AfDB financed the Banjul Port Design Study.
4.8
The above studies and TA work were of immediate relevance to the development process
of the Gambia and contributed to the policy design of the JAS and to individual project design.
Most of the work has been carried out by professional and specialized staff and thus are
generally of credible quality. The reports were disseminated widely. Most of these reports were
posted on the respective web-sites (AfDB/WB/Government). The following are planned to be
posted in GBOS’ web-site shortly: Integrated Household Budget Survey (2010); the Poverty
Profile; the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey, the Malaria Survey, and the Information
Communication Technology Survey.
Cooperation between the AfDB and WB within the JAS Context:
4.09 Cooperation between the AfDB and the WB within the context of the JAS has been
successful. The first AfDB/WB JAS (2008-2011) was initiated in response to the need for
harmonizing development assistance in The Gambia in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness. It was an attempt by both institutions to align their strategies and programs and
optimize their respective technical expertise. The partnership between the two institutions
resulted in complementarity and synergy through their lending and non-lending operations
(AAA). Both institutions supported policy and institutional reforms in the area of public finance
management. Whereas the AfDB focused on tax revenues, public audit, increased budgetary
allocations for poverty related aspects, the WB focused on improved budgeting, civil service
reform and price and marketing reforms in the groundnuts subsector.
4.10 In the area of technical assistance and institutional support, the AfDB focused on
macroeconomic and public finance management, whereas the WB focused on capacity
building in IFMIS. Intervention through institutional support and technical assistance provided
50

synergy to the policy and institutional reforms supported through the budget support operations
by both institutions, particularly in the area of public audit, macroeconomic modeling, financial
budgeting and planning and accounting for PRSP expenditures.
4.11 There is a general consensus amongst the country teams in both institutions that the
first JAS exercise has been an effective tool for coordinating strategies and streamlining the
lending and non- lending programs and activities, but there is still room to improve upon
the process. The consensus was that there has been very useful collaboration in the budget
support process, as there is an already established institutional process for that purpose. Similarly
the collaboration was very effective in the education sector, where the government plays the
leading role in coordinating development partners’ intervention. Discussion amongst country
teams has concluded that there is a need for a mechanism for closer collaboration - at the country
team level - in other major sectors of focus such as agriculture, regional integration,
infrastructure, and energy. This is particularly so in view of the relatively weak governmentdonor development coordination in the field. Cooperation between the two institutions in The
Gambia was further consolidated by the joint portfolio review exercise undertaken in 2011.
4.12 Efforts by the WB and AfDB to attract more development partners into the JAS
process have failed. However, donor coordination in general has been strengthened within the
overall context of budget support. The Gambia General Budget Support Program (GBSP) has
been jointly designed and monitored by the government, the AfDB, the WB and the European
Union (despite the latter not being a party to the JAS). A draft MOU outlining the modalities for
implementing and monitoring the program has been developed and a Joint Policy Reform Matrix
has also been developed. Semi-annual joint reviews of progress in the policy framework have
been undertaken. Notwithstanding these positive developments, the government’s lead role in
donor coordination remains weak because of capacity constraints - despite several efforts by the
JAS partners to strengthen the Aid Coordinating Agency in the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Affairs.
4.13 Joint Monitoring and Evaluation: The JAS outcome matrix provides a good framework
for the contribution of each institution to the development effort of The Gambia. However, there
is a need to improve upon the choice and quantitative indicators for the planned outcomes. The
mid-term review is another important tool of the joint M&E process. In addition, both
institutions take advantage of the semi-annual budget support review meetings, held semiannually in Banjul, to review progress in the implementation of the JAS and streamline their
respective programs. There is a need, however, to link more closely the JAS implementation
monitoring system to the Government’s PRSP monitoring.
Assessment of Country Capacity in Project Implementation
4.14 Capacity Development: The Civil Service Reform Study, which was jointly financed by
both institutions (AAA) and which was finalized in 2009 concluded the following: (i) the size of
the civil service and the wage bill were relatively reasonable compared to similar countries. (ii)
Staff composition emerged as a critical issue, mainly in view of the loss in upper grade staffs: it
has been estimated that the period 2003-2007 witnessed a 14 percent decline in managerial staff
(grades 11-12), whereas senior staff (grades 9-10) and junior staff have declined by 39 percent,
51

and 5 percent respectively, whereas the semi-skilled and unskilled (grades 1-3) have increased by
31 percent. (iii) A major cause of staff attrition has been the low salaries and benefits. (iv)
Human resource management has been accorded low priority. Efforts by both institutions during
JAS-1 has been focused on building capacity in the areas of macroeconomic management,
budgeting, public finance management, external and internal audit use and maintenance of
IFMIS and in national accounts and CPI (3.14-3.16). The forthcoming JAS will continue to focus
in public finance management areas, including MTEF, audit, and IFMIS.
4.15 The Joint AfDB/WB/GoTG Country Portfolio Performance Review undertaken in April
2011 has concluded that project implementation continues to be weak. Some of the major
factors, which contribute to weak implementation include: (i) inadequate funding of counterpart
funding of development projects; (ii) prolonged administrative delays in processing duty-waivers
for project goods and activities; (iii) weak capacity of PIU staff in the areas of procurement,
monitoring and evaluation; (iv) weak communication between the Banks and the coordinating
agency in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the PIUs.
V.

KEY LESSONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEW JPS

Key Lessons Learned
5.1
The undertaking of this AfDB/WB JAS-1 completion report is a step forward in the
cooperation between the two institutions, but more needs to done to harmonize the
processing in both institutions for joint JAS. The processing of this Completion Report has
been faced with difficulties because of lack of procedures specifically laid out for a Joint
Partnership strategy completion reports. Further problems were encountered because of
inadequate budgeting on the part of the AfDB associated with direct hire.
5.2
The role of the AfDB’s country team and the review process of the design and
program assessment of country strategies need to be revisited. There has been very little
interaction between the sectoral departments and the country program department, beyond
country team meetings. Thus, there may arise a risk of disconnect between the strategy process
and the programming process. It is therefore suggested that management of the AfDB should
revisit the design of country strategy process to strengthen the link between the strategy and
country programming.
5.3
Collaboration with other Development Partners needs to be further improved. Other
major development partners, who were active during the JAS period, include the IMF, the EU,
DFID, IsDB, UNDP, and Japan. The IMF has mainly provided TA in the area of revenue
mobilization, national accounts, and CPI data. DFID has been active in the area of TA in
financial management and poverty alleviation. The EU has supported poverty alleviation through
food security and income generation, decentralization, infrastructure development, energy and
agriculture and rural development. The UNDP has been active in governance reforms, poverty
alleviation, decentralization, and education. The IsDB invested in health, education and
infrastructure; whereas Japan has supported operations within the education, agricultural and
rural development. Attempts to draw other development partners into the JAS partnership have
not been successful, as most of the bilateral partners insisted on following their own procedures.
52

5.4
There is need to improve upon the programming aspect of the JAS at the design
phase. The planned JAS program for the AfDB was UA 15.00 million, whereas actual
commitments stood at UA 89.28 million – a six folds increase. Similarly the WB planned JAS
program amounted to US$ 20.25 million, whereas actual commitments stood at US$ 98.21
million – 5.6 times more than the planned amount. Most of the increase in both institutions was
due to inclusion of projects, which were not factored in during the JAS design phase and which
were financed from multinational allocations or from special accounts. Attempts should be made
to factor in “potential projects” at the JPS design phase for regional projects and special accounts
and to ensure that the proposed projects are consistent with the strategy.
5.5
A lesson learned from the mid-term review is the need to improve upon the quality
of the outcome matrix by identifying appropriate outcomes, which can be quantified, and for
which baseline data exist. Difficulties in this area were evident during the mid-term review,
following which the number of outcomes was reduced from seventeen to thirteen and
adjustments incorporated in four of the retained thirteen outcomes.
Recommendations for the Forthcoming JPS (2012-2015)
5.6
The two pillars of the 2008-2011 JAS continue to be consistent with the
Government’s PAGE (2012-2015). The first JAS pillar corresponds to pillars (iii) and (v) of
PAGE, whereas the second pillar of JAS corresponds to pillars (i), (ii), and (v). Thus, based on
the PAGE and the need to consolidate the gains attained under JAS 2008-2011, it is proposed
that the forthcoming JPS 2012-2015 should maintain Pillar I of JAS-1. Focus under component
#1 should be geared to support the major policy reforms in the next budget support program.
Potential outcomes under component #1 may include revising and updating the current PFM
program (2010-2014), measures to improve domestic resource mobilization, including tax
reforms (replacement of the current sales tax with VAT), public procurement reform, and the
introduction of a three-year MTEF rolling program, adequate budget allocations for the
maintenance and capacity building of IFMIS, consistent with the government’s IFMIS
Sustainability Plan.
5.7
The on-going institutional support and technical assistance operations (AfDB’s
ISPEFG II and IDA’s IFMIS project) complement the policy and institutional reform
agenda. Any fresh commitments of funds should be devoted to building capacity in PFM
monitoring and evaluation, internal and external audit, design and implementation of MTEF. The
forthcoming JPS should also consider pursuing further the civil service reform (component #2)
through the application of the enhanced human resources management policy and tools in public
administration. Public service delivery (Component #3) should continue to focus on basic
education, and water and sanitation.
5.8
The components under pillar II of the 2008-2011 JAS need to be reformulated to be
more strategically focused, yet catering for the investments introduced in infrastructure and

53

regional development19. Components 1 and 2 could be revisited and/or collapsed. The focus of
pillar II, however, should be on the agricultural sector and rural development (Component 3),
where the strategy should be on poverty alleviation and improved food security. The success of
the JAS within the agricultural sector should be consolidated with further appropriate
intervention. To contribute towards food security and to improve nutritional standards, it is
proposed that the forthcoming JPS should consider expansion in rice production, following
success of NERICA Rice Dissemination Project. Component #4 “creating an enabling
environment for development of the energy sector” could be pursued further, within a new
component relating to infrastructure.
5.9
There is need for both institutions to build on the established partnership during
JAS-1, through closer collaboration in critical sectors such as agriculture, regional infrastructure,
and energy. The institutions should also improve dialogue with the government and with other
development partners. Coordination between the JPS partners and other development partners
has already received a big boost through the semi-annual budget review meetings. There is a
need however, to build capacity within the government to enable them play the leading role in
donor coordination. There is also a need to improve the outreach to civil society, particularly
during the JPS design phase, to include the private sector, members of the National Assembly,
political leaders, and opinion leaders.

Annex 4: The Gambia Country Climate Fact Sheet
INTRODUCTION: This document is prepared as part of the African Development
Bank’s preparatory activities for the development of The Gambia’s Country Strategy
Paper (CSP) for the period 2012 – 2016. The objective is to promote climate proof
investments and climate resilient development in the country through mainstreaming of
climate change concerns into the country’s CSP. The Fact Sheet also identifies a range of
investment activities that the AfDB and WB could jointly finance in their support to the
country’s efforts to pursue sustainable development, particularly in the implementation of
its Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE - 2011- 2015).
GENERAL CLIMATE CONTEXT OF THE COUNTRY: Temperatures in The
Gambia generally increase from the coast towards the west. In the hottest season of April
to June (AMJ, the hottest (inland) regions have averages temperatures of up to 35°C,
whilst the cooler coastal regions are 25 to 28°C. In the cooler seasons of October to
December and January to March (OND and JFM) average temperatures can be below
25°C at the coast and up to 30°C in the west. The Gambia has distinct dry and rainy
seasons. Mean monthly wet‐season rainfall varies between 150 and 300mm between the
northern and southern extremes.
RECENT CLIMATE TRENDS: Mean annual temperature has increased by 1.0°C
since 1960, an average rate of 0.21°C per decade. The rate of increase is most rapid in
OND, at 0.32°C per decade. Available data indicate that the average number of ‘hot’
nights per year increased by 7.8percent between 1960 and 2003. Linear trends indicate
that wet season rainfall in The Gambia has decreased significantly between 1960 and
2006, at an average rate of 8.8mm per month per decade.
FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIOS: Recent scenario analysis produced by the UNDP
Climate Change Country Profiles for The Gambia. The mean annual temperature is
projected to increase by 1.1 to 3.1°C by the 2060s, and 1.8 to 5.0°C by the 2090s. All
projections indicate substantial increases in the frequency of days and nights that are
considered ‘hot’ in current climate. Projections of mean annual rainfall averaged over the
country from different models in the ensemble project a wide range of increases and
decreases in precipitation for The Gambia, but tend towards decreases, particularly in the
wet season. Projected annual change ranges from ‐23 to +18percent by the 2090s, with
ensemble means between 0 and ‐3percent. Projected changes ranges from ‐53 to
+74percent by the 2090s, with ensemble means between ‐7 and ‐ 20percent. Despite the
projected decreases in total rainfall, the proportion of total annual rainfall that falls in
heavy events tends towards increases in the ensemble projections. The IPCC (2007)
regional projections indicate that the coastal lowlands of The Gambia may be vulnerable
to sea‐level rise as sea‐level in this region is projected to rise by between 0.13 and 0.56
under different scenarios (Christensen et al. 2007).
TRENDS IN EXTREME WEATHER SCENARIOS: Climate change will magnify
natural disasters’ severity in terms of intensity and frequency in The Gambia. Substantial
increases in the frequency of days and nights that are considered ‘hot’ in current climate

66

are expected from climate change projections. ‘Hot’ days40 will occur on 22‐48percent of
days by the 2060s, and 25‐69percent of days by the 2090s. Days considered ‘hot’ by
current climate standards for their season may increase most rapidly during the rainy
season of July to September. Projected increases in hot days and nights are more rapid in
the east of the country than the west. The proportion of total annual rainfall that falls in
heavy events tends towards increases in the ensemble projections. It is expected that there
will be increasing frequency of extreme weather events evident in terms of floods and
drought in the country.
COUNTRY VULNERABILITY: The Gambia is one of the most vulnerable countries
in Africa to the adverse impacts of climate change. With approximately 50percent of the
total land area being less than 20m above sea level, and about 33percent of the country
below 10m above mean sea level, any significant global warming-induced sea level rise
could submerge much of the country. Currently, about 20percent of the country is
flooded annually and the mangrove ecosystems are already affected by saline intrusion as
well as flooding. Erratic rainfall patterns impact on freshwater reserves and increased
evaporation affects groundwater replenishment. The country’s First National
Communication projected that about 92 sq. km of land in the coastal zone will be
inundated as result of 1m sea level rise. This suggests that the whole of the capital city of
Banjul will be lost due to the fact that the greater part of the city is below 1m, with losses
estimated at 217 million US Dollars as at 2003. The other key sectors of The Gambia that
are considered most vulnerable to climate change are water resources, forestry,
agriculture, fisheries and energy, and health, and their potential vulnerabilities have been
elaborated in the country’s NAPA. In particular, agriculture which is about 99percent
rain-fed is extremely vulnerable to climate. This sector’s contribution to GDP is about
30percent and its share of the workforce is about 70percent.
COUNTRY CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY: Gambia has recognized the need to
address the challenge of climate change seriously, and has put in place many policies and
strategies towards promoting climate resilient economy and society. Some of the polices
and measures to directly or indirectly address the adverse impacts of climate change
include (i) National Adaptation Program of Action (NCC/NAPA, 2007); (ii) The Gambia
Environmental Action Plan II (GEAP, 2010); (iii) Nationally Appropriate Mitigation
Actions (NCC/NAMA, 2011); (iv) National Disaster Management Act (2008); (v)
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II (2007 – 2011); (vi) Program for Accelerated Growth
and Employment - PAGE(2011 – 2015), which integrated climate change in the
development strategies. Its pillar 5 has critical elements of environment, disaster risk
reduction and climate change treated as cross-cutting issues; ; (vii) establishment of the
National Climate Committee in 1992; and (viii) submission of the First National
Communication to the UNFCCC (NCC/FNC) in 2003). The encompassing strategic
approach of these initiatives is the pursuit of low-carbon high resilient infrastructure for
sustainable development. In addition, the Government of The Gambia has been
partnering with many donors to implement many projects that have significant bearing to
the issues of climate change.

67

COUNTRY MITIGATION POLICY: As climate change is mainly due to the
concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere that results in global
warming, any mitigation strategy will have to reduce the emissions of these gases and/or
enhance the carbon sinks. The country’s First National Communication to the UNFCCC
in 2003 identified options for reducing emissions of GHGs and for the greater
sequestration of these gases. These options include:






Reduction of the use of fossil fuel in the generation of electricity especially in the
rural areas;
Promotion of improved cooking stoves;
Carbon sequestration through reforestation and the protection of existing forests;
Integrated crop and livestock farming; and
Large scale introduction of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) to displace fuel wood

There is a serious ongoing attempt to promote alternatives to conventional energy sources
and secure of greater private sector participation.
COUNTRY ADAPTATION POLICY:
In response to the challenges of climate hazards and climate change the Government
completed the formulation of the National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) in 2007
which provides a policy framework to address the impact of climate change at national
and local levels. The main goal of the NAPA is the identification of priority adaptation
activities. Building upon the existing coping strategies implemented by local
communities in order to enhance their adaptation capacity NAPA seeks to: (1) understand
the main characteristics of climate hazards in The Gambia (flood, drought, salt water
intrusion); (2) understand coping mechanisms to climate hazards and climate change at
the local and national levels; (3) understand existing programs and institutional
arrangements for addressing climate hazards and climate change; (4) identify and
prioritize adaptation activities to climate hazards and climate change. Key national
adaptation measures are given in Table 9.

MDG 7: Ensure environmental sustainability

Progress made but in small increments

Source: Preliminary Estimates for the World Development Indicators 2013, the World Bank.
1)

Projections proposed have been modeled based on progress made in the latest available 5 year period. This reflects the assumption that the latest five year period and consequently a time
span that starts after the adoption of the Millennium Declaration (2001) and the Monterrey Consensus (2002) provides a more adequate picture of the impact of the MDGs on policies
implemented and respective donor support received by a current government or its immediate predecessor. Projections on MDG progress on this basis indicate the prospects of achieving the
targets, in case most recent policies were continued to be implemented in the same way in the years to come – and/or donor support in a respective sector would be maintained at the current
level. These projections also reflect more accurately any backdrops due to more recent events; i.e. the 2011 Sahel drought and related food crisis might have contributed to seriously delaying
progress on MDG 1: undernourishment.``

The category Met indicates that the MDG has already been met.
The category Sufficient Progress to be met by 2015 indicates that last observed five year annual growth rate indicates that MDG is on track to be met if growth rate is maintained;
The category Insufficient progress is defined as being able to meet the MDG between 2015 and 2020
The category Moderately off target indicates that MDG might be able to meet between 2020 and 2030
The category Seriously off target indicates that MDG will not be met even by 2030 or a reversal in progress has occurred
The category Insufficient data is defined as having not enough data points to be able to estimate 5 year progress or that the starting value is missing

We note that Jan 2012-December 2015 is the strategy period that will be proposed for the JPS, which is the period of
The Gambia’s ongoing PRSP (PAGE). Because of the differing FY of the two institutions, there may from time to time
be a difference in the FY referred to in some tables for the AfDB and the WB programs. The AfDB FY is concurrent
with the calendar year (Jan 1-Dec 31) while the WB FY is July 1 through June 30.

2The

President’s Office directly governs at least two ministries, at current: the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of
Energy. Two ministerial positions are currently not assigned: Information & Communication Infrastructure, and
Fisheries, Water Resources and National Assembly Matters, and seem to be covered by the Office of the President, as
well.
3
The basic primary balance excludes expenditures financed by projects, grants and external borrowing, as well as
interest payments.
4
The risks associated with the external debt are perceived as limited given that amortizations are gradual and interest
rates are very low.
5
Millet crop production grew at an average of 3.5%/year from 2005-9. Maize (growth of 17%/year during the same
period) and rice (as high as 82% /year) have shown particularly high growth. (see Draft Agricultural Sector Policy Note
by WB. May 2011).
6These

species include, for example, nesting and migratory birds and marine turtles, the eggs of which are frequently
collected; sharks, harvested for their fins; and manatees, hunted for meat, as well as growing conflicts between the
population and species such as hippopotamus as the two are increasingly forced to depend upon the same resources for
survival.
7The

President’s Office directly governs at least two ministries, at current: the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of
Energy. Two ministerial positions are currently not assigned: Information & Communication Infrastructure, and
Fisheries, Water Resources and National Assembly Matters, and seem to be covered by the Office of the President, as

8
48 of the 53 seats of the National Assembly are determined by direct elections, and five through nomination by the
President. The APRC won 43 of the 48 seats determined by direct elections.
9The

African Union observer mission came to the conclusion that the elections were conducted in accordance with the
legal and constitutional framework of The Gambia and with the Durban Declaration on the Principles Governing
Democratic Elections in Africa – even though the mission made several observations and issued a number of
recommendations on how to improve the process. ECOWAS - the Economic Community of West African States - had
neither sent observer missions to the 2011 Presidential nor to the 2012 Parliamentary elections, as the institution
deemed that the situation was not conducive to a "free, fair and transparent" poll. The Government of The Gambia
(GoTG) strongly condemned this decision.
10The

Gambia’s rank in the 2012 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index is 105 (out of 174), a sharp
decline vis-à-vis its rank in the 2011 Index which was 77 (out of 182).
11The

reform followed a Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) carried out by the World Bank in 1998.

12Efforts

have included the increase in the number of courthouses, the appointment of more judges, and the
establishment of institutions such as the Law Reform Commission, as well as ways to improve access to justice for the
poor, for example through the creation of an Alternative Dispute Resolution System and the establishment, by an Act of
Parliament, of a functioning government-funded National Legal Aid Agency to support the needs of litigants (including
children) that cannot afford the services of attorneys. Both have played a major role in addressing the needs of
Gambians with respect to access to justice and led to a reduction in the backlog in the courts.
13Between

2006 and 2011, the Gambia’s overall governance quality deteriorated according to the Mo Ibrahim
assessment, with large variations on the individual sub-indicators: During this period, there have been visible
improvements in the areas of “Sustainable Economic Opportunity” (+4.8) and “Human Development” (+5.8) whereas
the areas of “Safety & Rule of Law” (-7.9) and “Participation & Human Rights” (-8.6) registered significant declines.
The Gambia is ranking highest in Welfare (12th) and the Rural Sector (14th) and lowest in Accountability (37th) and
Rights (41st). The Freedom in the World 2012 report score on political rights decreased from 5 to 6 (out of 7) as
compared to 2011, and remained on the low level of 5 for civil liberties, which changed the country’s status in this
report from “partly free” to “not free”.

14Progress

included, for example, the elaboration of capacity needs assessments and strategic plans for 10 government
agencies, and the recruitment of international and national UNVs to fill critical capacity gaps. The National Assembly
was equipped with an E-Library and a system to digitalize the recordings of National Assembly and Committee

meetings. The legal framework has been updated, including the Public Service Act, General Orders, Public Service
Regulations, the Civil Service Code of Conduct, and Surety Bonds. A Government web portal has been established
linking 22 agencies and improving communications with Gambia’s diplomatic missions abroad.
15
This rate compares favorably by the sub-Sahara African average of 39%, but is still considerably higher than the 16%
(2012) in neighboring Senegal. Acute malnutrition remains stubbornly close to the WHO threshold criteria of 10% for
targeted relief interventions. In 2010, the rate was estimated at 9.5% (as compared to 8.9% back in 2000, Senegal’s
8.8% in 2012, and a sub-Sahara African average of 9%). Work to improve the nutrition of the population continues (see
below para 24)
16
The average HIV/IDS prevalence rate conceals large differences amongst young men and women aged 15 to 24,
however, with rates amongst young women (1 percent) more than double the rate amongst men (0.4 percent). The
estimated antiretroviral coverage for both genders continues rising, nevertheless, doubling to 18 percent in 2007
compared to 9 percent in 2004. These figures include expectant mothers living with HIV/AIDS, who saw their
antiretroviral coverage increase by over 50 percent between 2005 and 2007.
17 According to UNAIDS, the HIV prevalence in West and Central Africa remains comparatively low, with the adult
HIV prevalence estimated at 2% or under in 12 countries in 2009 (Benin, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Sierra Leone).
18
Estimations from 2010 Integrated Household Budget Survey jointly conducted by the Gambia Bureau of Statistics
(GBoS) and the National Planning Commission (NPC), and facilitated by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP). The poverty headcount ratio was measured at US$ 1.25.
19 The poverty lines used here are not entirely consistent: The poverty assessments in 2003 and in 2010 used different
methodologies, estimating poverty in 2003 at the US$1 and in 2010 at the US$1.25 lines. The Bank team assumes that
$1.25 in 2010 was roughly the same as $1 in 2003, implying inflation of about 3% per annum which is not too far off hence there is a limited comparability.
20
The ratio of consumption in the top quintile compared to the bottom quintile is estimated at 8.3, as compared to 6.9 in
Senegal.
21
Women constitute 45 percent of the economically active population, with a labor force participation rate of 72
percent, compared to 83 percent for males.
22
See: Gender Profile for The Gambia, AfdB 2011; and The Gambia Youth Employment and Skills Development
Study: Improving Youth Employment Opportunities Through Enhanced Skills Development, World Bank 2010.
23
Access to finance has been made more difficult recently because of the crowding out of the domestic financial market
by substantial T-bill emissions by the government to finance debt obligations. The Micro-Finance sector operates
without regulations which put clients at risk and obliges them to accept loans at very high costs. Formal credit to the
agriculture sector heavily depends on commercial banks, which mostly limit their exposure to large, short-term loans
for groundnut trading.
24
The steady and drastic decline in NAWEC’s financial performance was triggered to a large degree by the rise in crude
oil prices (the country's main fuel for power generation) from 2008 onwards for which NAWEC was unable to raise
offsetting revenues.
25
This is in line with international research findings showing the link between land ownership and related incentives for
more substantial investments on land, and productivity. The World Bank is currently planning to undertake more
detailed analytical study on land governance in several countries in the sub-region, including in The Gambia.
26
Other measures put in place to support the quality of teaching included additional learning opportunities for primary
teachers at the Gambia College, improved content knowledge through long distance learning and strengthened
supervision of teaching practice for student teachers. Progress has also been made in addressing teacher supply.
27
The IFMIS currently produces in-year fiscal reports with an average lag of one month and reconciles most banking
and fiscal records also on a monthly basis. In particular, the IFMIS system has permitted the closer control of the status
of budget execution and of spending levels; an enhanced management of ministerial resources due to the access to real
time information on the status of their budgets; a strengthened sectoral allocation, planning, and analysis; and greater
effectiveness in Government expenditure programs by identifying cost-drivers in program activities. An IFMIS
interface at the Central Bank has been established, ensuring real-time information on budget financing shortfalls and on
the timing of needed public domestic borrowing, and efforts are being made to regularize the Human Resource records
of central government employees on the IFMIS payroll.
28
The Government financial statements for 2008, 2009, and 2010 have been submitted to the National Audit Office.

This was confirmed following a World Bank mission in December 2011 which found that progress since the 2005
CPIP had been limited, and the Public Procurement system is still far from being fully operative in accordance with the
Act.

African Development Bank Group: The Gambia: Country Gender Profile, October 2011. The Gender Profile aimed
at the following: (i) Identify key gender inequalities that pose a challenge to poverty reduction and development; (ii)
assess existing policy and legal frameworks; (iii) examine gender gaps and opportunities for the promotion of gender
equality in the priority sectors; (iv) examine the institutional capacity for advancing gender equality and empowerment
of women both in government and the civil society; and (v) make recommendations for accelerating the advancement
of gender equality and the social and economic empowerment of women and their equal participation in decisionmaking.
31 Jit Gill Memorial Award for Outstanding Public Service
32 In this context the team is building on the conclusions of the World Bank 2012 Global Monitoring Report on “Food
Prices, Nutrition and the Millennium Development Goals”.
33 As discussed the recent World Bank report on “Improving Nutrition through Multi-sectoral Issues”, there are
opportunities in food security and agricultural projects to improve nutrition at the household level, however, the
operational parameters are often poorly understood.
34More specifically, it is envisioned to extend IFMIS to include all Self-Accounting (donor-funded) projects, an
interface with Central Bank System to implement Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) as a part of fully automated
Treasury Single Account (TSA) operations, implementation of the HR Recruitment Management Module for the entire
Government, capacity building in Professional Accounting and Information Technology, for example.
35
The IDA resource envelope estimate is updated annually updated annually based on the respective country allocation
parameters. The allocation is currently firm for FY12 (SDR 9 million) and FY 13 (SDR 11.1 million) and indicative for
FY14 (SDR 9.7 million). The FY14 final allocation may vary depending on: (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the
country’s performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits) and the
allocation deductions associated with MDRI annual debt service foregone; (iv) the performance, other allocation
parameters, and IDA assistance terms for other IDA borrowers; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. IDA17
estimated resources are based on the average IDA16 annual allocations; the actual allocations for IDA17 will vary
depending on resources available and on the outlined allocation criteria. Also, IDA allocation are provided in SDR
terms, while the US dollar equivalent amount is provided at the exchange rate of US$1.50233/SDR, the exchange rate
for each operation depends on the applicable prevailing rate at the time of approval. The (indicative) IDA-16 resource
allocation (SDR29.8 m equivalent to US$44.7 m) for The Gambia has considerably increased as compared to IDA-15
(SDR12 m).
36
The Government’s Education Program is now supervised jointly under Government leadership by all donors
involved.

37Had

the peg been fully enforced and maintained, the Central Bank would have likely seen a rapid drawdown of
foreign exchange reserves and the drying up of the foreign exchange market with significant implications on trade
activity including tourism, transit trade and government budget revenues tied to trade.
