SUMMARY
1.
Since the last full CAS was presented to the Board in 1996 (progress reports followed in 1998
and 2000), Cameroon has begun experiencing faster growth and declining income poverty, underpinned
by a stable macroeconomic framework and far-reaching structural and institutional reforms. Driven
mainly by renewed growth (averaging over 4 percent annually), income poverty declined by an estimated
13 points-to about 40 percent of the population-between 1996 and 2001. The protracted terms-oftrade-induced depression that dominated the decade up to the mid-1990s has now been substantially
reversed. But the recent pace of reform implementation has sometimes been uneven, as reflected in the
lag between the decision point under the enhanced HIPC initiative (October 2000) and the completion
point (which the authorities now aim to reach in the spring of 2004). And despite the decline in income
poverty, other social indicators-including HIV/AIDS prevalence, which now touches almost 12 percent
of the adult population-have not kept pace.
2.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Cameroon sets out planned lending and non-lending
support to the country from the World Bank Group over the period FY04-06, including base-case IDA
lending of US$125 million over the three years. Bank Group assistance is explicitly rooted in a results
framework, and is aligned with the agenda detailed in the country’s recently-completed PRSP, which was
presented to the Board in July 2003. The main challenge underlying PRSP implementation is one of
strengthening governance in order to help Cameroon meet the MDGs through better delivery of basic
public services and private-sector-led growth.
3.

The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:
Does the Board agree with the CAS’S emphasis on governance, specifically on the need to
strengthen the institutional framework for pro-poor economic management and service delivery,
as well as to improve the environment for the private sector, in order to best support PRSP
implementation?
Does the Board concur with the approach proposed in the CAS of gradual transition to
consolidated programmatic lending through PRSCs by FY06?

4.
Cameroon’s PRSP, which was based on extensive consultations and a thorough poverty analysis,
identifies the development challenges, notably that of improving governance. Recognizing that economic
growth needs to be raised above the level in recent years in order to reach the MDGs, the PRSP sets the
following priorities: (i) promoting a stable macroeconomic framework; (ii) strengthening growth through
economic diversification; (iii) empowering the private sector as the main engine of growth and as a
partner in social service delivery; (iv) developing basic infrastructure and natural resources in an
environmentalIy sustainable manner; (v) accelerating regional integration within the CEMAC framework;
(vi) strengthening human resources, bolstering the social sectors, and promoting the integration of
vulnerable groups in the economy; and (vii) improving the institutionai framework, administrative
management, and governance.
5.
The World Bank Group’s strategy has been aligned with the PRSP goal of poverty reduction
through improved basic service delivery and private-sector-led growth, underpinned by better
governance. The CAS is founded on two main pillars: (i) strengthening the institutional framework for
pro-poor economic management and service delivery; and (ii) reducing selected constraints to, and
directly supporting, private sector development. The following measurable improvements are expected
by the end of the CAS period:
0
the
Transparency and accountability in the mobilization and use of public resources-and
management of resources in education, health, and forestry-will have improved.
0
Rural communities in at least three of the country’s ten provinces will benefit from better service
delivery, and farmers will have begun increasing their productivity through improved extension
services and new technologies.

..

-11-

Models for improving service delivery in urban municipalities will have been tested, and selected
urban communities will have better access to water.
Vulnerable groups in more than 2,000 communities will have improved their response to the
threat of HrV/AIDS through preventative, curative, or mitigating measures, while the national
capacity to respond to the epidemic will have been strengthened.
Private sector companies will enjoy a reduced burden from regulatory, administrative, and
infrastructure constraints.

6.
The current portfolio-which includes operations supporting transport, HIV/AIDS, agriculture,
public-private partnerships, and the environment (notably in relation to the Chad-Cameroon pipeline)will contribute to the attainment of CAS results. New IDA lending-a total of US$125 million for FY0406 in the base case-will complement on-going operations to achieve these results, and help build the
associated capacity, as well as preparing the transition to programmatic lending. Lending would include:
(i) a community-driven development project to channel funds to rural communities and assist
decentralization; (ii) a forestry and environment operation to build on the significant reforms of recent
years and strengthen capacity in forest-related institutions; (iii) an education sector reform project to
strengthen the institutional framework; (iv) a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) to begin testing
institutional approaches to address urban poverty; (v) an energy sector support project to help address
recent power shortages; and (vi) a public sector capacity-building project to support the overall
institution-building and governance agenda. Support through a PRSC focusing on health, rural
development, and private sector development would be initiated in FY06. Base case lending will be
conditional on satisfactory implementation of the PRSP, on governance measures, and on IDA portfolio
quality, and a high-case lending scenario triggered by stronger performance, notably on governance.

7.
The Bank’s non-lending program will focus on: (i) overall PRSP and reform implementation,
sources of growth, and monitoring MDG action plans in health and education; (ii) public expenditure and
institutional/governance analysis in health, education, infrastructure, and agriculture; (iii) key reforms in
procurement and public finance through a CPAR and monitoring the CFAA action plan; and (iv) building
the PSD reform agenda with an Investment Climate Assessment. A Poverty Assessment will measure
progress, while a gender assessment and support for strategy formulation will help mainstream gender
issues in Cameroon’s development agenda. Core diagnostic ESW requirements will be provided for.
8.
IFC’s program will complement IDA’S to strengthen public-private dialogue on the investment
climate and assist with the implementation of key reforms. Previous advisory support for the privatization
of electricity will be complemented with joint IDA-IFC financing for additional generation capacity.
And options for further private participation in infrastructure will be developed. IFC will expand
financing and technical assistance to SMEs, help build competitive financial institutions, and complement
Bank-assisted reforms in the forestry sector with financing for sustainable forestry projects.
9.
Implementation of this CAS is subject to three broad-and inter-related-types of risk. One is
that of political turmoil, either domestically-induced (e.g., as elections take place in 2004), or regional
(but impacting Cameroon owing to the country’s prominence in the Central African Economic and
Monetary Community). A second is that of poor implementation progress in both the PRSP and donorassisted programs, possibly driven by faltering political will to implement governance-related reform. A
third is that of external shocks (e.g., in the terms of trade or foreign resource inflows). While political
risks cannot be directly influenced, World Bank Group support for PRSP implementation, including
capacity-building needs, in concert with development partners, will help mitigate some of these risks. In
particular, the focus on improving transparency and accountability in public financial management and
service delivery will help keep the governance agenda at center stage. The close macroeconomic
dialogue with the IMF under the PRGF will help mitigate risks associated with external shocks.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which sets out planned lending and non-lending World
Bank Group support to Cameroon over the period FY04-06, is rooted in a results-based framework and
aligned with the agenda detailed in the country’s recently-completed PRSP, discussed by the Board in
July 2003. The central challenge for Cameroon is to build on the reform momentum and poverty
reduction gains of recent years by broadening and deepening improvements in governance. On this basis,
the CAS is articulated around two main objectives: (i) strengthening the institutional framework for propoor economic management and service delivery; and (ii) reducing selected constraints to, and directly
supporting, private sector development.
2.
Together with the on-going portfolio, planned new IDA lending-a total of US$125 million over
FY04-06 in the base case-relates directly to the CAS objectives and to the specific outcomes identified
in the results-based framework. New lending will mainly consist of project-specific credits, with a
transition to more consolidated programmatic lending by FY06, inter alia through program support for
forestry- and environment-related reforms in FY04. Remaining in the base case will be subject to
satisfactory implementation of the PRSP, selected governance measures, and the IDA portfolio, failing
which Board presentation of any new operations-including notably the planned PRSC in FYO6-would
be deferred until corrective measures are taken. A high-case lending scenario, which would provide for
some US$35 million over the base case, delivered in the form of a larger PRSC, would be triggered by
specific achievements in “scaling up” the implementation of strategies in key poverty-reducing sectors, as
well as of specific govemance-related reforms.
3.
IFC’s program will focus on improving the investment climate, supporting private participation in
infrastructure, expanding financing and technical assistance to SMEs, helping to build competitive
financial institutions, and complementing Bank-assisted reforms in the forestry sector with direct support
for sustainable projects. The Bank’s non-lending program will help monitor PRSP and reform
implementation, as well as complete the core diagnostic requirements (notably through a CEM/DPR,
PEMGR, and a Poverty Assessment, as well as a new CPAR and monitoring the CFAA action plan), and
address key issues related to the investment climate and gender. Capacity-building will be an integral
part of both lending and non-lending tasks, focusing notably on PRSP implementation.

11. COUNTRY
CONTEXT
(i) Political and social context
4.
Cultural and social diversity. Cameroon became independent in 1961, inheriting Francophone
and Anglophone systems, and both languages officially co-exist. The Anglophone part of the country
covers the Northwest and Southwest provinces and represents about 25 percent of the population, the
Francophone part, the rest. The National Day (May 20) celebrates the joining of the country’s two parts.
Cameroon has more than 200 ethnic and linguistic groups, with the Beti, Douala, and Bassa dominant in
the South and the center, the Bamilkkk and Bamoun in the West, and the Foulbe, Borroros, Matakam, and
Toupouri in the North. Poverty and income inequality are still very high, with more than 40 percent of the
people below the poverty threshold.
5.
The challenge of maintaining political stability. In recent years, President Paul Biya, who has
been in office since 1982, has sent conciliatory signals by loosening the grip on political parties,
establishing a National Election Observatory, encouraging a freer press, and balancing appointments at
the senior levels, including that of an Anglophone Prime Minister. Biya’s Party, the RDPC, is still very
much in control, strengthening its position in the last legislative elections (July 2002). Presidential
elections are expected in 2004. Continuing improvements in political openness and overall security,
coupled with strong signals on corruption and governance, can reassure the private sector and the

-2-

international community. Long considered a safer haven than its turbulent neighbors, Cameroon is
expected to remain politically stable.

(ii) A turnaround in macroeconomic performance
6.
The origins of macroeconomic instability. Cameroon experienced commendable growth during
most of the 1970s and up through the mid-1980s. Boosted by exports of agricultural products (coffee,
cocoa, cotton) and crude oil, its GDP grew at 7 percent a year, sustained by investment of 25 percent of
GDP. By the mid-l980s, however, imbalances began to appear. Inflation was high (10 percent), and the
lack of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate resulted in a significant real exchange rate appreciation.
Fiscal and trade imbalances climbed rapidly as the terms of trade deteriorated and exports fell, external
debt began to swell, and domestic savings and investment contracted (the investment rate fell as low as 14
percent of GDP in 1992).
7.
The depression and its consequences. From 1986 to 1993, Cameroon experienced serious
economic difficulties, with per capita income falling 50 percent. The contraction was also reflected in a
severe fiscal crisis, leading to a large cut in nominal wages,' drastic cuts in education, health, and
infrastructure spending, and the accumulation of external and internal arrears.
8.
The 1994 devaluation and the initiation of reforms. In 1994 the 50 percent nominal
devaluation of the CFA Franc (30 percent real depreciation) and the trade and fiscal reforms within the
CEMAC marked a turning point in restoring macroeconomic stability. Although there was a return to
growth after the devaluation, Cameroon did not capitalize fully on the opportunity from 1994 to mid1996. The two IMF stand-bys and the IDA second structural adjustment credit went off track after one
quarter of implementation. In mid-1996 a new policy and economic management team showed clearer
resolve to tackle the structural problems in the economy. An Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
was worked out and approved by the IMF in August 1997. After the successful completion of the threeyear ESAF (1997-2000), the Government developed a growth-oriented macroeconomic program for
2000-03, supported by the IMF with the PRGF.

9.
The success of the two programs-and more generally of government reforms (forestry,
transportation, banking system, and privatization of public utilities)-translated
into better economic
performance. Real GDP growth was sustained around 4.7 percent during 1997-2000 and inflation
remained at around 3.5 percent. More recently, growth has remained strong, although recent targets have
been revised downwards as a result of power shortages. Growth in 2002 is estimated at 4.2 percent, and
4.5 percent growth is projected in 2003. Inflation stabilized around the 3 percent mark in late 2002.

10.
With better revenue mobilization and prudent expenditure policies, the fiscal position was
significantly strengthened. Non-oil fiscal revenues rose during 1996-200 1, gaining two points of GDP,
the result of better tax administration and implementing the value added tax (VAT). The overall fiscal
balance (commitment basis, excluding grants) has recently stabilized in the range of 1-2 percent of GDP.
11.
An unfinished reform agenda. Nevertheless, the stronger macroeconomic performance masked
serious problems of governance and inadequate attention to poverty and the investment climate. As a
result, growth has not resulted in tangible gains in job creation, poverty reduction, and living standards.
On a positive note, the incidence of poverty did fall considerably from 53 percent to 40 percent, durin
1996-2001. But growth has not especially benefited the core poor, and inequality has remained high.
High inequality and volatility in the economy remain important obstacles to poverty reduction. Volatility
has also meant fluctuations in budgetary resources, often hindering poverty-related interventions.

The cut by about half in the wage bill brought it 4.4 percent of GDP in FY95,one of the lowest in the CFA franc zone,
Inequality in Cameroon, measured by the Gini coefficient, is 0.41, around the average for Sub-Saharan Africa.

-3 -

12.
Revenue prospects challenging. The oil sector, only a few years ago a key source of growth
(roughly 8 percent of GDP, 50 percent of export receipts and 50 percent of government revenues), has
declined considerably since 1999/00, and its medium-term prospects do not look favorable. As the
downward trend in oil revenue continuesY3
the authorities will need to step up efforts to improve domestic
tax administration and tax collection, while also improving public resource management.

(iii) Cameroon in the subregion
13.
Cameroon plays a major role in the Central Africa subregion. It is part of CEMAC4 (Communaute‘
Economique et Mone‘taire dilfrique Centrule), which also includes the Central African Republic, Chad,
the Republic of Congo, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea. Cameroon accounts for half the region’s
population, 45 percent of its GDP, and 60 percent of its money supply. The CEMAC countries share a
common central bank (BEAC) and currency (CFAF).
14.
Cameroon spans more than 10 degrees of latitude, from Equatorial to Sahelian climate, and thus
benefits from the most diverse ecosystems in the area. Its access to the sea, particularly the port of
Douala, is important for its neighboring landlocked countries, such as Chad and the Central African
Republic. The Douala-Bangui corridor is already an important axis, and links to Chad are being
facilitated with the infrastructure developed along the 1070-kilometer-long oil pipeline.
15.
Cameroon’s relationships with its neighbors outside CEMAC are not very substantial. For
historical reasons, its relationship with Nigeria has been very weak and is now even more sensitive
because of the long-standing dispute over the Bakassi peninsula, on which a ruling was recently handed
down in favor of Cameroon by the International Court of Justice in the Hague. Still, with the more than
1,500 kilometer frontier, it is likely that informal trade between the two countries will remain significant.
16.
The most serious obstacles to regional integration are political. Cameroon and Gabon, the most
stable countries for many years and economically more developed, seem to be competing for leadership in
the region. Rivalries over the location of the regional stock exchange (Douala or Libreville) have
contributed to delays in capital market development, a constraint for local business.

111. POVERTY PROFILE IN CAMEROON
17.
Average annual GDP growth of 4.4 percent during 1995-2000 contributed to the partial recovery
from the crisis of the early 1990s and translated into some poverty reduction. The incidence of income
poverty in Cameroon (defined as the percentage of population with annual spending below what is
necessary to meet minimal food and non-food needs)5 fell by 13 points (from 53.3 to 40.2 percent) over
1996-2001. Nevertheless, this gain must be considered with caution, given the difficulty of comparing the
results of the two surveys in 1996 and 2001. Most of the gain can be traced to faster growth rather than
income redistribution benefiting the poor. And despite the gains, absolute poverty remains very high:
more than six million Cameroonians remain poor, and Cameroon is still far from achieving the MDGs
(Table 1).

Income distribution remains skewed, despite apparent recent improvements. Inequality, as

measured by the Gini coefficient, declined from 44 percent to 41 percent, around the average for SubSaharan Africa, over the period 1996-2001. Still, the wealthiest 20 percent of the population spend eight
times more than the bottom 20 percent. The high income inequality in Cameroon is a major concern
because income inequality diminishes considerably the impact of growth-oriented policies on poverty
reduction. Inequalities also have a regional dimension: Northern regions (Far North, North, Northwest,
Adamaoua and Central provinces) have a poverty incidence around 50 percent, far higher than the
average (Table 2). Bank interventions will target some of these areas, notably through community-driven
development programs. The poverty incidence in urban areas is much lower than in rural areas (17.9
percent compared with 52.1 percent). It has also declined more sharply (18 points, compared with 11).

Rapid urban growth (more than 6 percent a year) and the lack of investment in urban
infrastructure have contributed to the spread of illegal settlements, with little or no access to basic
services. Such settlements represent 50 to 60 percent of the area of Douala and Yaounde and two-thirds of
their population. Urban poverty has its own characteristics and so is difficult to compare with rural
poverty. The large share of urban population in Cameroon (50 percent) means that urban poverty has to
be taken seriously. Still, income-gap analysis indicates that the cash transfer necessary to pull a poor
person out of poverty is four times higher in a rural area than in an urban area (43,500 FCFA or US$88
compared with 10,000 FCFA or US$22).
20,

Education, sector of activity, and regions are the three main determinants of poverty.
@Educationappears to be especially important: for every 10 households, more than 4 live in poverty
when the head of family has no education, compared with 0.5 when the head of family is collegeeducated.
@Theincidence of poverty is highest for households headed by farmers (57 percent) and agricultural
wage earners (50 percent), who also make up the largest shares of the nationwide poor population
(70 percent for farmers and 11 percent for agricultural wage earners).
@Householdsin the rural hauts plateaux are twice as likely to be poor as households living in an urban
area (other than Douala and Yaounde).

21.
The participatory consultations on the poor’s perceptions of poverty (April 2000 and January
2002) reveal important differences across regions. Key factors that “account” for poverty are the: (i) lack
of employment opportunities; (ii) relative isolation due to the lack of physical infrastructure (mainly
roads); (iii) corruption and poor management of public resources and (iv) lack of access to social services
(health and education, especially in rural areas). Poor people in rural areas also attribute their situation to
higher input prices, unfair prices for agricultural products, and a lack of access to credit and training-all
from agricultural liberalization. In the North drought and the lack of access to water were the main
concerns. The lack of security is also seen as a serious concern.
22.
Cameroon could meet the key income poverty MDG target of halving the poverty rate by 2015.
But deeper analysis would be needed to confirm the sustainability of this trend which is based on the
PRSP base-case scenario assumptions for growth and demographic change. The PRSP also provides
quantified targets related to the MDGs, especially in the health and education sector, and indicates the

-6-

resource gap that will need to be filled in education and health for the country to remain on target with the
MDGs. But more than resources, reaching the target requires efficient policies, a higher absorption rate,
and stronger institutions (Box 1).
Box 1. Education illustrates the MDG challenges

The opinion is widely shared that weak governance is the main constraint to sustaining economic growth and
reducing poverty in Cameroon. Education illustrates the links between governance, poverty, and growth. The
quality of Cameroon’s education system, high in the 1980s, deteriorated in the 1990s. The economic crisis
resulted in a dramatic salary erosion (more than 50 percent). This fostered widespread corruption among
teachers and in the administration, where the “evaporation ratio” of public resources has been estimated at 70
percent.
Failure to allocate adequate resources to the sector and lack of investment, contributed to deteriorating
infrastructure.This situationjeopardizes Cameroon’s ability to reach the Millennium Development Goal: the last
available figures (1999) show that the primary gross enrollment rate has declined to around 76 percent, having
reached 91 percent in 1990. More important, poor quality and inefficiencies result in a completion rate of 43
percent (percentage of students starting the first grade who reach the sixth grade). To illustrate how worrisome
these declining trends are, if they were projected forward, by 2015 only 1 child in 5 would complete primary
education, putting Cameroon seriously off track for the Millennium Development Goal of 95 percent
completion.

Iv. NATIONAL
PRIORITIES FOR POVERTY REDUCTION-PRSP
(i) National priorities
23.
Cameroon’s PRSP, completed and adopted by the Government on April 8, 2003, was discussed
by the Bank and Fund Boards, along with a Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), in late July 2003. The JSA
found the document’s main strengths to be a comprehensive and genuine consultation process, a candid
assessment of the root causes of economic and social problems, a solid poverty diagnosis, detailed
strategic orientations for the future, and a commendable effort to cost out the implications of the strategy.
Areas requiring greater attention included the institutional framework for monitoring PRSP
implementation, and how PRSP priorities and the related medium-term expenditure framework would
form the basis for future budgetary allocations.
24.
In the PRSP the Government outlines its vision and medium-term objectives. Promoting growth
and reducing poverty by half by 2015 call for a twofold approach: a diversification of the economy to
significantly increase the real growth rate, together with proactive and targeted measures to better
distribute the benefits of growth.
25.
The Government’s strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction is articulated though
seven priorities: (i) promoting a stable macroeconomic framework; (ii) strengthening growth through
economic diversification; (iii) empowering the private sector as the main engine of growth and a partner
in social service delivery; (iv) developing basic infrastructure and natural resources in an environmentally
sustainable manner; (v) accelerating regional integration within the CEMAC framework; (vi)
strengthening human resources, bolstering the social sectors, and promoting inclusion of vulnerable
groups in economic activity; and (vii) improving the institutional framework, administrative management,
and governance.

(ii) Medium-term macroeconomic framework
26.
Medium-term growth prospects. Reaching the MDGs, as indicated in the PRSP, would require
sustained annual GDP growth of around 6 percent. To achieve this, the Government intends to redouble

-7-

its efforts to implement a new generation of economic and social reforms-to improve competitiveness,
create a business-friendly environment for investment, and accelerate private-sector-led growth. In the
meantime, the Government is determined to make every effort to anchor growth in the activities of the
poor, to maximize the employment creation effect and the poverty and social impact.
27.
Sources of growth. The PRSP has developed in detail an ambitious medium-term strategy for
diversifying the economy and accelerating growth. The central scenario targets a growth rate that would
rise steadily from an estimated 4.2 percent in 2002 and a projected 4.5 percent in 2003 to reach 6 percent
in 2007 and 7 percent by 2010 and beyond. Overall, GDP growth would average 6 percent over the next
decade, roughly one percentage point above the performance in 1997-2002. Although shrinking slightly
as a percentage of GDP, the primary sector would remain an important contributor to growth, owing
largely to buoyant food and forestry sectors. And surging agro-industrial, textile, and wood product
sectors would more than offset the decline of the oil sector, accounting for the steady rise of the industrial
sector relative to GDP. Stronger non-oil exports would improve the current account. And boosted by
public sector capital spending in priority sectors, the investment ratio would gain 1.4 points over the
period, reaching 19.7 percent of GDP by 2007. Private investment would also increase as a percentage of
GDP, supported by higher private savings, the result of strong income growth and slighter lower private
consumption growth (See Annex 2 for more details on the central macroeconomic scenario).
28.
Welfare implications. Per capita consumption would remain strong, with a steady rise of 3
percent a year, bringing sustained improvements in household welfare. With the foregoing growth
profile and taking into account the sectoral decomposition of growth and related differences in the
elasticities of poverty to growth, the projected decrease in the poverty rate is 18 points, close to the MDG
target. But deeper analysis would need to confirm the robustness of the elasticities (roughly two
percentage points a year in poverty reduction for each two points of growth in annual per capita income).
29.
Public finances, the medium-term expenditure framework, and debt sustainability. The
Government’s fiscal policy is built on lower oil revenues, higher non-oil revenues, rationalized public
expenditures and better targeting of spending to priority sectors. The overall fiscal balance (excluding
grants) is projected to stabilize at around a surplus of 1 percent of GDP. Total revenues are expected to
decline slightly from 19.4 percent in 2003 to 18.8 percent of GDP by the end of 2007, a result of the
expected decline in oil revenue from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2003 to 2 percent in 2007. The projected
shortfall in oil revenue would be partially offset by increase in nonoil revenue, projected to reach 16.8
percent of GDP in 2007. Public expenditures are projected to stabilize around 17.5 percent of GDP, which
would allow the Government to meet sectoral objectives while maintaining financial prudence. To
confirm its commitment to human resource development, the Government aims to have public
expenditures on education and health steadily rise to reach 4 percent and 1.5 percent of GDP respectively
in 2007. The MTEF also indicates that the Government is determined to commit a significant share of
resources (15 percent of total internal budget and 2.7 percent of GDP) to infrastructure. Finally, a
detailed debt sustainability analysis has been carried out (see Annex 4), and shows a sustainable longterm evolution of the country’s debt indicators-consistent with IDA lending scenarios-that is robust to
reasonable parameter variations (e.g., on export growth).

v. CAMEROON’S MAIN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE: BETTER GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC
SERVICE DELIVERY TO FOSTER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION

30.
Cameroon faces two key challenges in reducing poverty: (i) accountability and transparency in
the use of public resources are insufficient, with scarce public resources poorly targeted to priority
sectors; and (ii) the regulatory framework and investment climate are not conducive to private sector
development. The planned program of the World Bank Group is designed to address these challenges.

-8-

(i) Greater accountability and transparency in the use of public resources
3 1.
Pro-poor resource allocation will not be effective unless there is a marked improvement in the
transparency and accountability of mobilizing and using public resources. Government intends to achieve
this through structural reforms dealing with the effectiveness of spending, procurement reform, and civil
service reform. Given the amount of HIPC resources that will be made available at completion, it is not so
much finding financial resources that is critical for Cameroon-it is the way resources are actually used
and accounted for.
32.
Effectiveness of expenditures. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA),
undertaken in June 2002, highlighted important shortcomings in monitoring of public expenditures. A
priority action plan agreed on with the authorities focuses on strengthening the reliability of the loi de
r6glement of public spending surveillance by: (i) ensuring the independence of the Chamber of Accounts;
(ii) giving responsibility to sector ministries to certify satisfactory completion of works and acquisition of
goods and services; and (iii) setting up a General Inspection service, with a full-fledged mandate to audit
any beneficiary of public funds.
33.
Procurement reform. As provided for in the last CAS, a Country Procurement Assessment
Review (CPAR), completed in FYO1, found the procurement environment in need of improvement in
several areas. Although the procurement reform has suffered delays in its implementation, the
Govemment has put in place concrete measures to achieve some of its objectives. Systematic monitoring
at two levels+x ante monitoring by specialized commissions with independent observers and ex post
monitoring by independent auditors-has been initiated and is now fully in place. Two other features of
the proposed reform have been initiated: the regulation and systematic monitoring of public procurement
through the creation of the regulation agency-Agence de Regulation des March& Publics-and the
broadening of the responsibilities of the contracting authorities. But Cameroon now needs to speed up
implementation of the agreed framework by adopting a new procurement code and the application of
sanctions. This will contribute to private-sector-led growth by reducing transaction costs and increasing
the access of the private sector to public contracts. Sanctions will help dissipate the impression of
impunity and build confidence within the private sector.
34.
Civil service reform. In response to the economic crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the
Government had to take drastic measures to reduce its expenditures to a level consistent with the available
resources. Wages in the administration were reduced by 50 percent in 1993, and the CFA Franc was
devalued by 50 percent in January 1994. Among other effects, the associated reduction of purchasing
power, provoked absenteeism and an overall demobilization of civil servants, and spread corruption
throughout the administration.
35.
The Government has initiated a reorganization of the administration along several lines. A
downsizing program financed by French Cooperation and the European Union (US$25 million) has
allowed for a reduction of about 6,000 staff, including redundancy and voluntary resignation. At the same
time, a civil servant census identified 4,500 ghost staff. Restructuring and privatization of public
enterprises, particularly public utilities (electricity, telephone), has entailed further streamlining. In
education and health, the private sector operates alongside the administration to deliver services-3 0
percent of children are attending private schools, and more than 40 percent of the population receives
medical care from the private sector. Such partnerships between private and public sectors, at the center
ofthe reforms outlined in the social sector strategies, need to be broadened.
36.
Allocation of public resources to priority sectors, previously inadequate, has recently improved,
as reflected in the medium-term expenditure framework of the PRSP. In health during 1990-98
Cameroon spent 5 percent of GDP on health care, 1 percent public and the remainder private. This public
spending on health care was lower than the Sub-Saharan average of 1.7 percent of GDP. In education,

-9-

public expenditure averaged 2.7 percent in 2000, again below the average for African HIPC countries (4
percent). One challenge for Cameroon is to improve the budgetary allocation process, by integrating the
annual budget cycle into the medium-term expenditure framework and possibly moving to a mediumterm budget planning process, consistent with the timeframe of PRSP policies. A second is to implement
the decentralization process and local participatory planning as mechanisms for improving accountability
and public service delivery to local communities.

(ii) Improved investment climate for private sector development and competitiveness of
Cameroonian businesses
37.
Private sector development in Cameroon is critical because public resources will be inadequate to
attain the investment needed to sustain growth and create employment. Competitiveness needs to improve
significantly merely to maintain Cameroon’s small market share in world trade. Efforts in this regard have
focused on the ongoing public enterprise divestiture program complemented by reforms in the financial
sector. But they need to be shored up rapidly by measures improving the investment climate, attracting
foreign investment in the nonoil sector, and enhancing the potential of the national private sector. Three
key areas need attention.

3 8.
Regulatory environment including administrative barriers. There is an unfinished agenda for
state disengagement and the creation of a regulatory environment that sets out clear rules for competition
and reduces uncertainty for the private sector. A case in point concerns agriculture. The cocoa and coffee
office is subsidized through a levy on coffee and cocoa exports (thus paid by the producers), but its value
added is unclear, particularly as a committee for coffee and cocoa (the CICC) mandated to oversee
compliance with deontological practices and fair competition is already operating and in need of
strengthening. Several poorly performing rural development agencies carry out commercial activities that
impede private sector development. Much progress has been achieved in privatizing agro-industries, but
remaining work awaits completion.
39.
Throughout all sectors, owing to an overly bureaucratic regulatory environment, administrative
barriers and rent-extracting practices are widespread. They range from simple red tape issues, which can
discourage many smaller businesses from expanding and joining the formal sector, to time-consuming
and clearly rent-seeking administrative practices, which seriously impair the competitiveness of
Cameroonian firms. Relations with the customs, tax, and labor administrations are quoted most
frequently.
40.
Legal system and functioning of the judiciary. A well-functioning legal and judicial system
able to enforce contracts and guarantee property and creditors rights, is indispensable for encouraging
investment. Cameroon has adopted a set of modern business laws, which came into effect between 1998
and 2000 and replaced existing national legislation. But enforcement of the new business laws by the
judiciary still poses problems that need to be addressed by the Ministry of Justice through training
magistrates and eventually imposing appropriate sanctions for noncompliance. Nor does the existence of
modern business laws do anything about pervasive corruption in the judiciary and the lack of enforcement
of court decisions.

41.
Access to, and cost of, infrastructure. The third important set of measures is ensuring adequate
access to infrastructure (transport, electricity, telecommunications) at competitive costs. The privatization
of the railway and the Douala Port (through a concession) as well as of the electricity and telecom
companies are important milestones. But beyond the completion of the transactions themselves, the
regulators need to ensure that efficiency gains by private operators are partially passed through to users
(including businesses) and contribute to increased competitiveness. In particular, the electricity sector,
which remains one of the most binding constraints, will be an area of attention.

-10-

42.
In addition to improving the investment climate, experience in other African countries has
demonstrated that the supply response capacity of small producers in the agricultural and industrial
sectors is constrained by limited access to resources and business know-how. These two issues need to be
addressed.

*Access to affordable financing for SMEs. The provision of innovative and appropriate instruments
for SME financing is currently being implemented in a number of pilot countries.

*Lack of capacity at the producer or firm level. Firms need support to develop the technical,
managerial, marketing and other business skills needed to be competitive in Cameroon, but also on
the global market. There is a need for provision of business development services and training as well
as increasing the effectiveness of agricultural extension services. In the agricultural sector, pilot
operations for contracting out such services to non-governmental entities need to be tested urgently to
help diversify service delivery.
43.
Agriculture shows all the shortcomings: unsatisfactory regulatory framework, insufficient access
to farm inputs (particularly improved seeds and planting materials), insufficient infrastructure (rural road
network, high-cost port operations for agricultural exports, and lack of access to market price
information). Small wonder that Cameroonian coffee producers receive only 70 percent of the FOB price
at best (compared with more than 90 percent in Vietnam). Removing such impediments in the private
sector environment and increasing capacity are essential for reducing poverty.

VI. THEWORLD BANKGROUPASSISTANCE STRATEGY

(i) The World Bank Group results-based assistance strategy
44.
The World Bank Group strategy for FY04-06 is aligned with the Government’s medium- to longterm objective of poverty reduction through two main pillars: (i) strengthening the institutional
framework for improved pro-poor economic management and service delivery and (ii) supporting private
sector development to diversify the economy and accelerate growth. The strategy cuts across and
contributes to the PRSP, focusing on key areas where the Bank Group has a comparative advantage (e.g.
proven expertise, global knowledge, long track record in support of reforms, strong field presence,
diversified instruments to support private investment). The CAS seeks continuity in the ongoing reform
program, while moving gradually towards a more programmatic approach, for which it prepares the
ground. It uses new instruments to support critical second-generation reforms in order to maximize the
impact of development programs for communities and to promote private sector development. Although
modest in amount, Bank Group support aims to catalyze other donors and build partnerships around the
two main pillars of this CAS.
45.
Table 3 shows the measures to track progress toward targeted outcomes and to help align the
ongoing and planned program with results. Additional detail is in Annex 1, which describes the results
framework.

Pillar 1: Strengthening the institutional framework for improved pro-poor economic management
and service delivery
46.
The World Bank Group will contribute to Cameroon’s progress in achieving two main
development goals: (i) accelerated growth based on greater diversification (agriculture, industry, and
services); and (ii) reaching the poor in rural and urban areas through improved basic services. A common
thread will be a focus on governance issues.

47.
These ambitious development goals expected to be reached only in the medium term. During this
CAS period, the World Bank Group will focus on improved effectiveness and efficiency in public
resource management at the central and local levels, a cross-cutting theme of the PRSP. By the end of the
CAS period, it is expected that there will be measurable improvements in the transparency and
accountability of the mobilization and use of public resources and the way resources are managed in
education, health, and forestry.

-13-

Improving the transparency and accountability of mobilizing and using public resources
48.
There are several constraints to achieving this improved use of resources that will be addressed
by the CAS period. The World Bank Group will support the removal of these constraints through lending
support and Analytical and Advisory Activities in key areas, in partnership with the Government, civil
society, and donors. The constraints and related Bank support are described below.

49.
Improving coordination between ministries. The PRSP process has been instrumental in
enhancing coordination across ministries. Such coordination will continue to be a key factor in aligning
the use of public resources to the objectives of the PRSP, and our policy dialogue will aim at
mainstreaming this management change. The instruments used under this CAS will promote such
coordination, already the case with ongoing projects, such as the MAP and the Petroleum Environment
Capacity Enhancement project. In addition, a community-driven development project will enhance
multisectoral approaches at a local level. The World Bank will continue to assist sectoral ministries in
establishing detailed MTEFs and including them in the overall macroeconomic framework. The Bank will
also provide assistance to the Government to implement an investment module that will be disaggregated
by region to ensure that investment in priority sectors is targeted to the poorest areas. The gradual move
towards a programmatic approach should also enhance the coordination across sectors, initiated under
SACIII.

50.
Aligning the budget process to the PRSP objectives will be a priority. The Bank will provide
support to the Government to gradually establish a full-fledged medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF). During the PRSP process, support has focused on two priority ministries (Health and
Education). During the CAS period, assistance will be extended first to the rural sector, then to other
sectoral ministries (telecom, gender, justice, social affairs) once they finalize their strategies. In addition,
in line with the findings and recommendations of the CFAA dated June 2002, the Bank will monitor the
implementation of a priority action plan to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure.
This priority action will be coordinated with the broader long-term reform of Cameroon’s public finances,
supported by the IMF, the European Union, and French Cooperation.

5 1.
Improving transparency in procurement. Procurement reform, including putting in place a
new procurement code, is part of the overall governance agenda to reach the HIPC completion point.
Implementation of the reform will be strengthened early in the CAS period, targeting more transparent
processes for improved competition and more efficient use of public resources. Audits that, by law, need
to be conducted will help measure progress. Bank support will focus on monitoring the implementation of
this reform and providing ad hoc support to improve the regulatory framework for procurement, to
strengthen public procurement institutions, and to build borrower capacity in procurement.
52.
Strengthening the involvement and capacity of civil society. The overall objective is to help
civil society play an active and independent role in the identification, planning, execution, follow-up, and
evaluation of projects, thus contributing to an improved management of resources. This process has
already started under the HIPC initiative. But given the weakness and diversity of civil society in
Cameroon, its involvement will require intensive capacity building to help the civil society organize itself
and strengthen its ability to produce and process relevant information, while respecting its independence
as a development stakeholder. The World Bank office in Cameroon, in collaboration with UNDP, has
launched a capacity-building program for the 50 largest NGOs in the country. This is the first step in
making NGOs more effective in the implementation of PRSP objectives and more credible with the
Government and donor community. World Bank support during the CAS period, especially in the course
of project preparation and implementation, will seek to extend active partnerships with the civil society
(including NGOs, faith-based institutions, the media, and trade unions). The decentralization program to
be encouraged in the proposed community-driven development operation will also call for a larger role
for civil society, providing a platform for further capacity-building.

-14-

53.
Addressing data capacity and dissemination issues. A critical element in aligning the use of
public resources to PRSP objectives is the monitoring mechanism. Despite recent improvements in the
production and use of data, coverage and quality issues remain, restricting the scope for detailed impact
assessments of recent structural reforms. It is also important to improve the coordination of statistical
activities among Government institutions and to expedite the launching of the National Institute of
Statistics.
54.
Developing statistical capacity to improve governance and accountability needs to aim at: (i)
eradicating inconsistencies and discrepancies in macroeconomic data; (ii) meeting the full needs of
authorities in charge of macroeconomic management; (iii) building the capacity of the administration and
the private sector in data collection and analysis, especially in agriculture, social sectors, infrastructure,
and environmental issues; and (iv) improving the quality of analysis. The Bank and other donors will
actively support this agenda, with Bank support concentrating specifically on data collection and
processing for monitoring the PRSP.

Improving the use of public resources in education, health, andforestry
55.
Overall reforms in public administration will be complemented by specific support to the
education, health, and forestry ministries. Support to other key ministries-agriculture, public works, and
transport, already provided for in ongoing operations-will continue.
56.
Public administration reform. New statutes have been adopted introducing greater flexibility
for managing the civil serivce, including the right to dismiss for economic reasons. Further reforms
should focus on: (i) improving the quality of services to beneficiaries; (ii) facilitating decentralization and
staff management; (iii) fostering public-private partnerships; (iv) reforming and harmonizing salary scales
as a starting point for eliminating corruption in the public service, and (v) developing systematic
evaluation of the public service and civil servants.

57.
The Bank will support this agenda through a public sector reform operation. It will help
modernize the administration through capacity-building activities such as training in situ and distance
learning. Through the distance learning program envisaged in the Education operation, the Bank will
facilitate learning on poverty reduction strategies and best practices in trade, financial sector
development, regulatory reform, the legal environment, and the business climate. In addition, Bank
interventions will focus on improving management and resource flows in key line ministries (health,
education and agriculture), as well as in sectors where reforms need to be consolidated (forestry and
transport).
58.
Education. The PRSP identifies education as a key determinant of poverty in Cameroon, which
is part of the Education for All initiative. Implementation of the Education Sector Strategy (ESS) started
in 2001 and will be strengthened during this CAS period, with a country status report completed in the
coming months. On this basis, the World Bank-in addition to helping consolidate the current ESS into a
long-term strategy, which will include a comprehensive policy framework and detailed action plans to
achieve the Millennium Development Goals-will support an Education Capacity BuiIding Project. The
objectives will be to reinforce the management capacity of the MINEDUC and MINESUP, improve
governance, and accelerate the implementation of reforms through a decentralized and more efficient
administration. An institutionaVgovernance review and PER covering the education sector, among others,
will serve as an instrument to monitor improvements in the flow of resources.
59.
Health. The track record of Bank involvement in Cameroon’s health sector calls for caution,
notably in light of the unsatisfactory implementation experience of the Health, Fertility and Nutrition
Project, which closed on June 30, 2001. A critical test will be the satisfactory implementation of the MAP
project, with the Ministry of Public Health in a leadership role. As in the education sector, the World
Bank Group will provide support to prepare a realistic action plan to reach the MDGs, and to improve the
use of public resources, including those fiom the HIPC debt relief. A public expenditure and institutional

-15-

review will serve as a monitoring tool. Finally, an operation to provide institutional support will be
prepared by the end of the CAS period, so no direct outcomes will be expected during this CAS. IDA
assistance will provide sector-wide support to the health sector as a way of redefining the role of the state
to provide public goods and services more efficiently and to ensure a more equitable distribution of
benefits. Strong emphasis will be placed on: (i) promoting equity in health outcomes, with a special focus
on diseases that most affect the poor; (ii) enhancing efficiency in service delivery (through
decentralization, performance monitoring, and beneficiary assessment of access, use, and satisfaction);
(iii) ensuring sustainable financing arrangements that protect the poor, increasing public funding, and
improving public resource allocation; and (iv) managing and strengthening links with the private sector
and NGOs.
Box 2. Past reforms in forestry
While a lot remains to be done, some evidence of the Government’s political will and capacity to implement
difficult sector reforms and governance can be found in forestry, where the legacy of links between vested
interests and political elites was strong and known for its resilience to all reforms efforts. In a few years, using
the SAC111 forest sector agenda as a framework, a strong interdisciplinary team of reformers within the
government began transforming a sector that not long ago was opaque and dysfunctional. Though still recent and
fragile, the reforms introduced during the past few years in Cameroon have helped test approaches and
Government effectiveness in areas that are key to the success of the proposed CAS, particularly good
governance, economic reform, and poverty alleviation.
Examples of reforms
Competitive award of concessions with participation of an independent observer. A new system of competitive
bidding that includes the involvement of an independent observer has been in place since June 1999. In addition
to increased transparency, the new system has increased area-based forest royalties by 40 times the pre-reform
level. Half of these revenues accrue to local governing bodies in rural areas.
National strategy for the allocation of logging rights. Adopted in 1999, this strategy guided the expansion of
areas under legal, competitively awarded forest concessions and the withdrawal of logging rights of various
types that had been obtained under unclear or questionable conditions. Part of the strategy involved the
enactment of more stringent controls in the field.
Law enforcement against well-established vested interests. More than US$15 million in penalties is being
levied against well-documented cases of illegal logging. Noteworthy is the enforcement a penalty exceeding
US$10 million on a very large company known to operate with impunity until only two or three years ago,
Implementation of the Forestry Tax Revenue Enhancement Program. A Forestry Tax Revenue Enhancement
Program has been under way since June 1999, under the joint responsibility of the ministries in charge of Forests
and Finance. Under the program, the Ministry of Finance recorded a significant growth of forest fiscal revenues,
over a period in which recorded logging actually went down.
Establishment of a guarantee system to ensure compliance with fiscal and environmental obligations. The
system was adopted as part of the Finance Law of June 30,2000, and a Decree dated November 27,2001, under
which private companies must deposit a bond that can be cashed by the government if the company fails to
fulfill its environmental and fiscal obligations. FCFA 15 billion in guarantees had been secured by 2001.
Supervision of forest management and reinforcement of the Ministry’s capacity in this area. Supervision of
management plans is now ensured by the Government through two partnerships:
.World Resources Institute-Global Forest Watch will ensure annual monitoring of all logging activities in
Cameroon and will detect illegal forest harvesting through modern remote-sensing techniques.
.Global Witness will participate as an independent observer in field control missions conducted throughout the
year by the Forest Department’s Special Control Unit to check compliance with management plans and the
quality of record-keeping. It will also assist compliance with penalties to be enforced by ministries in charge
of forests, finance, and justice, testifying that fines are actually paid, and criminal penalties or sentences
enforced.

-16-

Forestry. Implementation of the SAC111 reforms has improved the policy environment and
60.
incentive framework for forest development (Box 2). Cameroon has created a functional body of policy,
legislation, regulations, and partnerships on which forest management and conservation can be safely
grounded. Looking forward, however, Cameroon may not be able to ensure continued implementation of
these new policies without further support from the World Bank Group and other partners. Strengthening
government and non-government institutions for implementation and oversight of the new policies and
regulations will be essential. Difficult decisions and the implementation of new programs will have to be
sustained and assisted by long-term capacity building.
Environment. Efforts to develop a national capacity for environmental management in
6 1.
Cameroon are under way, particularly in monitoring the Environment Management Plan of the Petroleum
Development and Pipeline Project. Capacity building has been slow to start, partly due to the nature of the
cross-sectoral task, which involves the Ministry of Environment and Forest, the Ministry of Public
Works, the Ministry of Mines and Water, and the Ministry of Public Health, among others, under the
coordination of the Pipeline Steering and Monitoring Committee, hosted by SNH (National Petroleum
Company). The Petroleum Environment Capacity Enhancement Project that supports this effort will
continue to require active supervision. As the Pipeline Project moves into the operations phase, the focus
will be on capitalizing on this experience so that future public investments benefit from the same
environmental standards and from the skills acquired by staff. The second phase of the multidonor
Regional Environment Information Management Program, supported under the World Bank Regional
integration assistance strategy for CEMAC, will also be instrumental in sharing and applying this
knowledge and experience regionally.

Improved service delivery in key sectors
62.
Measures to be supported through the planned lending and AAA programs are expected to
improve the delivery of critical services. Work on community-driven development, decentralization,
gender mainstreaming, and rural development will be the focus of Bank Group interventions. Better
management in key line ministries will contribute to improving access to critical basic services. In
particular, expenditure tracking and beneficiary assessments will be conducted in the health and education
sectors. This approach needs to be complemented by more decentralization in the management of
resources to finance these services and more involvement of beneficiaries in the decisions related to the
delivery of basic services.
63.
Rural communities in at least three provinces will benefit from improved service delivery.
Many local development initiatives6 have contributed to (i) involving local communities in the
development process; (ii) preparing local development plans;7 (iii) financing demand-driven community
infrastructure (schools, health centers, wells); (iv) strengthening capacity of local service providers in
community development and participatory approaches; and (v) putting in place a community roads
program. Based on these experiences, three main challenges for community-driven development have
been identified, First, the initiatives lack coordination among donors and regions-they now need to be
harmonized and integrated to take into account the multisectoral nature of rural development. Second,
these initiatives need to be scaled up. Most of them remain at a pilot stage, not reaching most of the
country, and many local development plans have yet to be financed. Third, the technical and financial
weakness of the Communes limits their involvement in local development.
64.
With the donor community, including AFD, AfDB , IFAD, German Cooperation, and Netherlands
Cooperation, the World Bank Group will support the Community Development Program that is expected
to be one of the key instruments to give concrete content to the second pillar of the PRSP. Active

Projects financed by IDA (PNVRA), French Cooperation, the European Economic Commission, IFAD, and AfDB.
Under the PNVRA, 300 villages have appraised their needs and prepared Plans detailing their priorities.

-17-

involvement in this program would foster decentralization, with NGOs, associations, and local
governments playing an important role.
65.
While decentralization has been slow in Cameroon, experience from other countries shows that it
is key to ensuring that decisions are taken close to the primary beneficiaries and thus contribute to a better
allocation and use of public resources. The 1996 constitution called for the Government to transfer some
responsibilities to regions in health, education, water, secondary and tertiary roads, markets, and
community development. Until now, the relevant laws have not yet been finalized, and specific texts
required to complete the legal framework have been in preparation for more than five years. The awaited
texts are expected to lay down: (i) general rules applicable to municipalities; (ii) specific provisions
applicable to regions; (iii) specific provisions applicable to local councils; and (iv) conditions for electing
regional council members. The CAS will thus focus on providing inputs for the finalization of a legal
framework that would facilitate community development as a means to initiate active decentralization
from the bottom up.
66.
Farmers will begin to improve their agricultural productivity through better extension
services and new technologies. The Government’s rural development strategy has the following
objectives: (i) modernizing production systems; (ii) improving the incentive framework; (iii) restructuring
the institutional setup; and (iv) sustainably managing natural resources. Turning this strategy into a
concrete action plan with a sound monitoring and evaluation system will require resources and a lot of
capacity-building. The key institution for this task is a technical secretariat that includes several
ministries, chaired by the Minister of Agriculture. World Bank support to the technical secretariat will
involve, in addition to close collaboration and dialogue in the formulation and implementation of the rural
development component of the PRSP, workshops and training on policy formulation and monitoring and
evaluation.
67.
The Government‘s rural development strategy emphasizes a role for producer organizations: their
capacity needs to be enhanced, and their representation at provincial and national levels needs to be
supported to build their institutional base, improving their management and the transparency of their
activities. Grant resources could also be mobilized. Innovative delivery of extension services, contract
farming, and productivity-related activities will be promoted. The ongoing Agricultural Extension and
Adaptive Research Project will be used to test pilot activities, over a two-year period, to establish the
basis for follow-on support. In addition, the Rural Development Unit is launching a tree-crop
development initiative to formulate operational mechanisms to promote perennial agriculture. Cameroon
is well-suited as a pilot country to test this initiative.

Groundwork for improving service delivery by urban municipalities will be tested, and
68.
selected urban communities will gain improved access to water. The challenge is to reconcile the two
objectives of maximizing the contribution of cities to sustain the development of the country while
vigorously attacking the roots of poverty in and around the urban areas. A very large consensus is
emerging among the various stakeholders and donors on the concept of “City Development Contracts”
(contrats de ville). The objective would be to make municipalities responsible for the choice and
financing of actions within the framework of a project by contracting interventions. The focus is on two
priorities: (i) building up a database (now lacking) on demographic, physical, fiscal, financial, and
socioeconomic conditions, including analyses of the contribution of cities to the economy and the
immediate hinterland,8 and (ii) improving the scope of secondary infrastructure (such as access roads to
unserviced neighborhoods) because such investments-now largely ignored by the donor communityhave a direct impact on the poor while contributing directly to the local economy and efficiency of the
8
Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as UN/World Bank sponsored City Development Studies (CDS) and
“ECOLOC” (Economies locules) studies developed by OECD/Shale Club and the Municipal Development Program (MDP)
would be useful tools.

-18-

city. Bank support will take the form of a pilot project for preparing and implementing such city
development contracts, with the objective of anchoring improved governance at the local level, promoting
decentralization, and targeting poverty and local economic development.

69.
Gender issues. As in most developing countries, gender issues in Cameroon have not received
the attention and support they deserve. Recent attempts by the Government, through its Ministry in charge
of Women’s Affairs, to put together a National Strategy for the Promotion of Women still needs further
work and translation into concrete action. In fact, the proposed strategy needs strengthening and support
for gender issues during the PRSP implementation process. The strategy also needs to ensure that in
building the capacity of civil society, special attention is paid to the needs of women groups-to ensure
their integration into decision-making at all levels, from grassroots-based activities to national
policymaking.
70.
In addition to proposals destined to improve the social and judicial status of women in the legal
and governance agenda, proposals for the economic empowerment of women in agriculture and the
private sector need to be supported. The Bank Group will provide support in this area through analytical
work that looks at gender rights, economic empowerment of women, current laws and regulations, and
capacity building initiatives for gender mainstreaming that will encourage all ministries, not just the one
in charge of Women’s Affairs, to tackle gender issues as part of their core business. Such analytical work
will contribute to the Bank Group’s analysis of risks and vulnerability to poverty. For investment support,
particularly in agriculture and in the fight against HIV/AIDS, a strong gender focus is essential if
operations such as the MAP and the National Program for Participatory Development are to succeed on
the ground.

Targeted communities will improve their response to the threat of HIV/AIDS through preventive,
curative, or mitigating measures, while the national capacity to respond to the epidemic is
strengthened.
71.
In the fight against HIV/AIDS, the World Bank Group will act on four major fronts. First, the
ongoing Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project being deployed in all 10 provinces supports action plans
prepared by public and private organizations. It focuses on a few major issues: behavioral change,
voluntary testing and counseling, support to community and civil society responses, antiretroviral (ARV)
therapy pilots, and monitoring and evaluation of the pandemic and the efforts to fight it. Further World
Bank involvement will focus on fostering implementation of these activities, ensuring that the National
Committee, with a majority of civil society representatives, is effective and that funds are transferred to
around 4,000 targeted communities. Second, World Bank support to the Global Fund aims at facilitating
access to ARV and opportunistic infections treatment. The Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project will begin
testing ways to select who really needs financial support to gain access to these treatments. Third, other
projects would be called on to contribute to the fight against HIV/AIDS through impact assessments in
their sectors and the implementation of sector-specific strategies. Fourth, the Country Office in Yaounde
will pursue its successful partnership with associations of people living with the HIV virus, faith-based
institutions, orphanages, and NGOs in order to keep HIV/AIDS at the center of the national debate. The
Country Office outreach program on HIV/AIDS carried out in 2002 and 2003 in major schools in
Yaounde will now be expanded to other main cities (Douala, Bafoussam, Bertoua, Foumban,
Ngaounderk, and Garoua). The Government will take steps to speed up implementation of the MAP and
get all sector ministries to finalize their action glans. Synergies will be sought with a planned regional
HIV/AIDS operation for the Lake Chad Countries.
Pillar 2: Support private sector development to diversify the economy and accelerate growth

72.
World Bank Group interventions will contribute to Cameroon’s efforts to raise annual growth
from 4.5 percent to 6 percent in the medium term. Investment will increase in industry and agribusiness,

-19-

as outlined in the second pillar of the PRSP. And villages will be better integrated into the economy, as
proposed under the second and fourth pillars of the PRSP.
73.
As a tangible step towards achieving these medium-term development goals, the Bank Group will
focus on addressing constraints encountered in the business environment: (i) regulatory and
administrative barriers; (ii) high costs, inadequate access, poor reliability of infrastructure, and
insufficient electricity production capacity; (iii) limited access to financing; and (iv) business
development services, especially for SMEs. The CAS also recognizes the regional dimension of
Cameroon’s development, especially as it affects private-sector-led growth. In addition, IFC will seek to
complement the Bank’s support on governance and sector reform with private investments in forestry.

Private sector will face reduced burdens (cost, time) associated with regulatory, administrative and
infrastructure constraints
74.
Regulatory and administrative constraints. The CAS will seek to address Cameroon’s
investment climate and competitiveness through a comprehensive investment climate assessment, as the
basis for a reform agenda and action plan. To set priorities and galvanize consensus on implementation,
IFC and the Bank will support a redesigned forum for public-private dialogue on investment climate
issues to succeed the Competitiveness Committee. IFC will support the functioning of this body, and the
Bank will make resources available through the on-going Public-Private Sector Partnership for Growth
and Poverty Reduction Project. This approach will ensure active involvement by the private sector and
thus help address residual complaints that the private sector is not consulted before measures affecting the
profitability of businesses are taken by the administration. Bank Group support is expected to focus on
regulatory and administrative barriers. FIAS and MIGA are expected to provide assistance to a newlyestablished Investment Promotion Agency and to help implement a new Investment Charter.

75.
The retrenchment of the Government from direct commercial activities, and the reduction of its
presence in financial markets, have been facilitated by past adjustment programs (SAC11 and SACIII) and
IFC advisory services and investments (SONEL privatization and BICEC investment). This process will
require continuing support and monitoring by the Bank Group in the medium term and technical support
as needed. This will be especially critical for the remaining parastatals in agribusiness. The next stage will
be to improve competitiveness.
76.
Legal and judicial system reform. Bank support for legal and judicial reform during this CAS
period will be knowledge-based. An ongoing audit of the judicial system will provide the basis for a
broader plan concerning legal and judicial reform. Preliminary conclusions indicate that poor capacity,
corruption, and undue delays have prevented the judicial system from effective contract enforcement and
dispute settlement, clouding the investment climate. Reforms will need to focus on three main
components. First is strengthening procedure for developing new legislation, by establishing a central
legislative policy development group, as a joint group of the Presidency, the General Secretariat of the
Prime Ministry, and the Ministry of Justice. Second is strengthening judicial and law-making institutions
involved in drafting, developing, implementing, and enforcing laws and regulations. The objective is to
reinforce the judiciary, improve the organization of the courts, and enhance the access to legal
information and legal aid. Third is advancing legal education by increasing the funding for law faculties
and the national school dedicated to training civil servants and by developing regular training programs
for lawyers, judges, and other legal practitioners. When this diagnostic is complete, steps will be taken to
enhance the content of learning and training programs, modernize academic premises, improve access to
legal publications, introduce information technology, and develop exchange programs with other
countries, The proposed FY06 Public Sector Reform Project will be one of the vehicles for supporting
these activities.
77.
Infrastructure constraints and support to the energy sector. SONEL, the integrated electric
utility, was successfully privatized in 200 1 with advisory assistance from the Bank Group. Immediately

-20-

following privatization, however, the company experienced difficulties which have undermined support
for further infrastructure privatization and threatened the success of this key private venture. For the past
two years, Cameroon has faced a severe electricity crisis, with recurrent power cuts during the dry
seasons. The main reasons are insufficient generation capacity to respond to increasing needs as the
country industrializes and vulnerability to climatic conditions as 95 percent of capacity is hydro-electric,
concentrated on one river basin.
78.
One of the options contemplated by the Government, the Lom Pangar dam, has raised some
concerns for the World Bank Group because of potential negative social and environmental impacts
related to long-term and cumulative changes in the Sanaga river system flow regime. The flooding of a
large dam catchment area would affect a portion of the Deng Deng forest, a biodiversity hotspot explicitly
protected under current arrangements in the context of the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline project. A costly
adjustment was made to the pipeline route to avoid going through the central Deng Deng forest area and
avoid other dense forest areas. In response to Government concerns about reliable and affordable
electricity, a more comprehensive examination to explore various scenarios to address short, medium, and
long term needs, explicitly incorporating social and environmental concerns, is being undertaken. The
Bank Group will continue to play a catalytic role in this process, to ensure that an investment plan to
address the short-, medium-, and long-term need is agreed upon, complying with World Bank Group
safeguard policies and government commitments under the current portfolio, and is properly financed.

79.
The new investment requirements in the sector for the next four to five years are substantial (up
to US$400 million). They will need to be funded through a blend of concessional and private financing to
ensure that electricity is affordable while access is extended. To this end, IFC and IDA are working with
other donors to finance short-term capacity needs to be met through new thermal generation capacity,
while helping define and build consensus on appropriate long-term options. A US$10 million Energy
Sector Support operation has been included in the lending program, along with planned IFC financing, as
a potential vehicle to play this catalytic role in a sector critical for economic and private sector
development. Cameroon may also be able to identify alternative sources of power generation in a regional
context. (CEMAC envisages a study on the potential sources of power generation and related
interconnections within the region.)
80.
The Transport Sector Project, soon to be closed (December 2003), has achieved important results
in the management of roads. At the end of the project, the agenda for sector reform will be pursued,
alongside sustainable financing for the sector through the Road Fund, to include building capacity for
planning and setting priorities, strengthening transport sector SMEs, and completing the port sector
reform agenda begun under SACIII. The CEMAC regional integration agenda will be advanced by
formulating a transport facilitation policy, preparing corridor-based action plans, and implementing the
rural transport strategy.
81.
The Bank has supported the planned privatization of CAMTEL; IFC will seek to finance the
private concessionaire and other private operators in specific sub-sectors, such as data transmission. IFC
is conducting a sector study of communications and information technology to identify key investment
projects for development and financing. In other infrastructure sectors, where outright privatization or
concession is not feasible or likely, the Bank Group will seek to structure opportunities for private
participation, as in the transport sector.
82.
Financial services. Means of payments are essential for trade and commerce and for
macroeconomic stability. In the PRSP, the Government has identified increased savings mobilization as a
key element in a strategy to support economic growth. Since 1996, Cameroon’s financial sector has been
undergoing a major restructuring. Most of the banks were fully rehabilitated. Some were liquidated.
Others were split into a healthy bank and a liquidation structure. And a few were recapitalized. IFC has

-21-

invested in one of the fully privatized banks, BICEC. Today, almost all large commercial banks are
privately owned, solvent, liquid, and profitable.' Several new banks have entered the market-one U.S.,
one West African, and two Cameroonian. The insurance sector was also restructured, with several
companies liquidated and others recapitalized. The restructuring of the sector has improved governance,
as delinquent borrowers are no longer allowed to obtain further bank credit and participate in bids for
public procurement and privatization. They are also prevented from holding management positions in a
microfinance institution.

83.
A joint Bank-IMF FSAP, conducted in 2000, outlined the need to vigorously pursue the ongoing
reforms of the microfinance sector, to undertake reforms of the payments systems, to rehabilitate the
postal savings and the housing banks, and to complete the reform of the social security system. With the
exception of the housing bank, reform is under way in all these areas. For microfinance, new regional
regulations were adopted in the first quarter of 2002, a flexible regime recognizing the specific nature of
microfinance institutions. Support is now needed for COBAC to fulfill its mandate of supervising these
institutions. To fulfill this role, its staff needs to be reinforced. Assistance is also needed to bring the
financial cooperatives in conformity with prudential standards." The Government has also launched a
reform of the postal savings bank. With the help of consultants funded under the on-going Public-Private
Sector Partnership for Growth and Poverty Reduction Project, it will proceed with a financial and
organizational restructuring of this institution. But the quality of services offered by the postal savings
bank depends on the post office itself, which needs restructuring. In 1998, the Government launched a
major two-pronged reform of the pension system. The cleanup of rosters at the CNPS" have started. And
the Head of State approved a far-reaching reform of the social security system, including the privatization
of its management. But the reform is lagging, and renewed commitment is needed to implement it.
84.
Looking forward, the Bank Group will closely monitor the implementation of these reforms. New
actions will be taken, such as developing instruments for long-term financing and for SMEs and
refocusing the recovery corporation (SRC) on providing services to banks and other enterprises. IFC will
seek to develop CFAF bond markets through guarantees and credit enhancements for quality issuers, and
technical assistance services to the new capital markets authority. IFC expects to implement key
investments in leasing stemming from recently completed technical assistance. And it will pursue other
SME financing vehicles, including microfinance banks, credit ratings agencies, and local currency
guarantee mechanisms. IFC will support the continuing development of the banking sector with selected
investments and institution-building technical assistance. The restructuring and privatization of the
housing bank, as discussed in the FSAP, will require the authorities to first elaborate a housing
development strategy.

85.
Support to SMEs. During the CAS period, the Bank Group will significantly expand business
development services to SMEs-to
complement the financing initiatives and help build the
competitiveness of the private sector. The IFC Africa Project Development Facility recently opened an
office in Douala and will be expanding its activities to:
.Build the credit analysis capacity of financial institutions through a loan officers' training
program, developing and offering new training modules. Mentoring and coaching programs are
under discussion with various financial institutions (BICEC, CENAINVEST).
.Build the capacity of local consultants to service SME needs, through training and the
development and implementation of an accreditation program.
9

Only one small bank presents some difficulty and is under close watch from the regional banking commission
(COBAC).
10
Cameroon was the first of the six CEMAC countries to complete the licensing of existing financial cooperatives: 324
institutions received a license and 388 unsuitable institutions were removed from the registry at the Ministry of Agriculture.
11
CNPS is the social security institution serving private sector workers.

-22-

.Strengthen the capacity of business associations and schools to deliver services to SMEs. Several
agreements are already under discussion, notably with GICAM, the leading business association
in Cameroon.
.Working with the power and water utilities to develop standards and procedures for their
subcontractors. The linkage programs will include training and technical assistance to the SMEs
to enable them to meet the standards.

86.
Other initiatives will use intermediaries and demand-driven mechanisms, such as matching grant
funds or voucher schemes, to make access to local training institutions affordable while promoting a
market for private business development services. The approach could include support to local SMEs in
construction (preparing bids for small construction or civil works contracts, cost calculation, project
supervision). Cameroon is not currently included in the initial round of countries establishing an
integrated program of SME support and financing implemented by IFC with IDA support. But such a
program will be discussed with the Government, and it could be formalized in the current CAS period
with funding from the private sector component of the planned PRSC. Such a program would expand the
scale of initiatives discussed above and offer a more comprehensive approach.
87.
IFC support to sustainable forestry projects. Cameroon has made important headway in
implementing transparent, environmentally sustainable forestry management policies. And it has the
biggest wood-cutting and processing capacity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Within the framework of the
recently-revised policies that permit appropriate tropical forestry projects, IFC will pursue investment
opportunities that will showcase these policies and introduce best practices in environmentally sustainable
forestry and downstream wood products manufacturing.
88.
In light of its limited involvement in forestry in the past, IFC will seek, as an initial step, to
improve its knowledge of the industry and with a view to developing key investments. A review of the
industry to identify opportunities, to be undertaken in FY04, should provide the basis for follow-up
investment activities.

(ii) Regional dimension of World Bank Group assistance
89.
The World Bank’s Board discussed a Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS) for the
CEMAC countries on February 6, 2003. This strategy is based on the premise that regional integration
can contribute to poverty reduction by strengthening the links between the poor landlocked countries
(Central African Republic, Chad) and their more prosperous coastal neighbors (Cameroon, Congo
(Brazzaville), Equatorial Guinea, and GabonFand more generally by helping establish the basis for
faster economic growth. The CAS recognizes the role that Cameroon already plays-in infrastructure
development, transport facilitation, natural resource management, banking and financial management
systems, and agricultural production. Improving the serviceability of multi-country transit corridors
toward Chad and the Central African Republic serves the landlocked CEMAC countries and benefits
internal trade.
90.
Several operations in the current portfolidhad-cameroon pipeline, Douala Infrastructure,
CAMRAIL railways concession-are fully supportive of the strategy. In addition to these operations,
efforts will be pursued during the CAS period in support of reforms and activities destined to complement
the regional program. These include: (i) implementing the customs union (a recent report highlighted
deficiencies to be corrected in each CEMAC country); (ii) improving clearing procedures at the port of
Douala; and (iii) facilitating transport along the corridors through the progressive removal of
administrative and “bogus” barriers. The emphasis of this CAS on governance will help Cameroon
address generic issues in both public sector reform and private sector development so that Cameroon can
establish substantive leadership in the CEMAC region. To be explored during the CAS period, mainly in

-23-

the analytical program, are the formal and informal flows between Cameroon and Nigeria, a basis for
stronger ties between the two countries.
91.
Regional payment system. With the financial assistance of the first regional IDA credit in the
central Africa region, the central bank, BEAC, has launched a major reform of the payments system. It
was well-documented (FSAP) that the long manual clearing systems presented definite risks for the
newly-restructured banks and hampered the growth of the banking system and the private sector. This
project will introduce real-time settlement for large or urgent transactions, an electronic clearing system
for mass payments, and a modern card system. Delays in payment clearing and settlement will be
significantly reduced to a maximum of three days for bank-to-bank transactions and seven days for clientto-client transactions. As a by-product, a prepaid card system will be developed for electricity and water
consumption, contributing to better access to these services for more consumers.
92.
The Bank plans to supervise this project actively as a key vehicle under the RIAS for the
CEMAC Region. A regional microfinance project, complemented by potential IFC investments in
commercial microfinance banks, is also envisaged under the RIAS to support the implementation of the
recently-adopted regional regulations. Cameroon, which hosts more than half of the microfinance
institutions, is expected to play a leading role.

(iii) World Bank Group country program and vehicles for assistance
93.
In the base case, the IDA lending program in FY04 will include: a community development
project, cofinanced by AFD, IFAD, KfW, and Netherlands Cooperation that will channel funds to rural
communities and accompany the decentralization process in Cameroon (Table 4). A Forestry and
Environment SECAL will be launched to further strengthen the reform process in this strategic sector and
build capacity in forestry institutions. The preparation of an Energy Sector Support project will also be
initiated, to be delivered in FY05.
94.
In FY05 an Education Sector Reform Project will be launched, and a Learning and Innovation
Loan (LIL) will start testing institutional approaches to address urban poverty. The lending program for
FY04 and FY05, coupled with the completion of some of the building blocks for PRSCs (such as the
P E M G R exercise) through the Bank’s Analytical and Advisory Activities, will set the stage for a PRSC
in FY06, focusing on health, rural development, and private sector development. Also in FY06 a Public
Sector Capacity Building Project will also be launched in support of the overall governance agenda. For
all these operations and to the extent that all major donors are in favor of supporting Cameroon’s poverty
reduction strategy, cofinancing will be sought systematically.
95.
Under the non-lending program, informal work will monitor the macroeconomic environment,
including the HIPC process, PRSP implementation, trade prospects (especially with Nigeria), and the
monitoring of action plans developed for MDGs in health and education (FY04-06). Formal work will
focus on completing or updating core diagnostic ESW. A Development Policy Review focused on
sources of growth analysis will be prepared in FY04. To advance the governance and public resource
management agenda, a PER and institutionaVgovernance review exercise will be undertaken in key
sectors (health, education, infrastructure, agriculture, and possibly the judiciary) in FY05. A gender
assessment and strategy support exercise (FY05) will help mainstream gender in the country’s
development. A Poverty Assessment (FY06) will measure progress in PRSP implementation. Under this
program core diagnostic ESW would be completed and/or updated. Key reforms in procurement and
public finance will be supported through a new CPAR (FY06), and there will be follow-up action on the
CFAA. IFC advisory projects and investments will be initiated in FY04, and realized throughout the CAS
period. The comprehensive SME program will also be put in place in FY06 with support of the PRSC.

IDA portfolio management and performance. The current portfolieincluding operations in
transport, HIV/AIDS, agriculture, public-private partnership, and environment-will contribute to the
attainment of CAS objectives (Annex 1). Eight of nine operations in the current portfolio are rated
satisfactory. During this CAS period, emphasis will be put on project supervision to improve quality of
portfolio and the timely completion of activities, to ensure better use of committed IDA resources. Work
initiated in this area in March 2002, and re-emphasized in a CPPR in December 2002, will be pursued in
close collaboration with the Government through bimonthly portfolio review meetings with MINEPAT,
project units, and the World Bank office in Cameroon. Particular attention will be paid to project M&E
systems to make sure they are fully operational and fit the overall framework of PRSP monitoring. In line
with the overall goal of addressing governance issues, this effort should help build the capacity of the
administration to monitor and evaluate and thus to improve accountability.
97.
IFC portfolio management and performance. IFC's portfolio has increased significantly to
about US$141.5 million'* as of June 30, 2003, largely due to the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project, with
12

-25-

US$86 million allocated to Cameroon. Portfolio performance is substantially above the IFC average in
loan performance, given the dominance of this one project and two other large projects-Orange
Cameroon (US$5 million) and Pecten (US$44 million)-all
performing well. Measured by the ratio of
reserves against losses to disbursed balances, Cameroon’s 3.4 percent compares favorably with 15.5
percent for IFC overall and 15.3 percent for the Africa region. The dominance of these large projects
masks the poor performance of IFC‘s smaller investments. The country’s total loss reserves of US$3.4
million are concentrated in only six projects with an outstanding disbursed balance amounting to US$4.15
million (4.1 percent of the total outstanding disbursed balance), reflecting a loss reserve ratio of more than
80 percent.

(iv) Lending scenarios and triggers
98.
The base case lending scenario will be subject to satisfactory implementation of the PRSP,
selected governance measures, and the IDA portfolio. Failure to meet the base-case criteria in Table 5
would result in Board presentation of any new operations-including notably the planned PRSC in
FY06-being deferred until corrective measures are taken. A high-case lending scenario, which would
provide for some US$35 million over the base case, delivered in the form of a larger PRSC, would be
triggered by specific achievements in “scaling up’’ the implementation of strategies in key povertyreducing sectors, as well as of specific governance-related reforms. While IFC investments and technical
assistance activity will not be explicitly tied to the IDA lending triggers, the level of IFC activity can be
expected to be closely correlated, as it will depend on overall levels of private investments, themselves
affected by government performance in the areas noted.

The completion point under HIPC initiative is scheduled for April 2004, albeit with some
uncertainty as to whether it will be actually reached on time. By that time, Cameroon could be in a
situation where the completion point is reached, and HIPC funds are made available to finance activities
in priority sectors (as described in HIPC documents, and refined in PRSP documents). Given the volume
of HIPC resources (US$1.26 billion, of which Bank share is less than 15 percent) and since IDA
resources for FY04-06 amount to US$125 million, (in addition to US$179 million to be released under
HIPC) the Bank would have only modest leverage in financial terms. But it would use these resources to
complement other donors and HIPC resources to finance PRSP activities.
100. Alternatively, Cameroon could be in a situation where the completion point is delayed by 6
months, 12 months, or more. Under such circumstances, the dialogue with Government would likely be
rather difficult, and IDA resources would fit in a less consensual strategic framework towards poverty
reduction, In a sense, then, the HIPC initiative is an excellent test of the will of the Government to work
in partnership with the community of donors and the World Bank Group.

(v) Partners and participation
101. The difficult policy dialogue in the past makes it even more critical to improve coordination
among donors, to ensure that a consistent message is conveyed on governance reforms and ways to
reduce poverty-and
that an assessment of Cameroon’s overall performance is cooperative and
consensual.
102. As shown in the results-based matrix in Annex 1, and in the matrix in Annex 5 on donor
coordination, there are many synergies between other donors’ interventions and Bank Group assistance.
More specifically, the governance agenda is broadly shared by the community of donors, with support
from (among others) UNDP, the European Union, and French Cooperation. Public finance reform and
capacity-building are key elements of donor support that will be complemented by the Bank’s focus on
public sector reform. The strong collaboration with the IMF on monitoring the HIPC initiative and PRSP
implementation will continue. Currently, there is active multi-donor coordination on the community
development program. The same can be said of the education and health sectors, where the Bank Group is
working closely with Japanese Cooperation, WHO, and French Cooperation. Forestry and environment is
also an area where there is close collaboration between the Bank Group and key donors (DFID, French
Cooperation, German Development Cooperation, and the European Union). Finally, Bank Group
upstream support to remove selected constraints to private sector development will complement others
donors’ direct support to investments (on the road program, for instance) and to private companies.
103. The CAS, prepared in close collaboration with the donor community, will be complemented by a
renewed effort on donor coordination through: (i) sharing information on sector strategies, with joint
funding of programs and projects; (ii) providing feedback on implementation and generic portfolio issues
for ongoing operations; and (iii) undertaking joint coordinated efforts in communicating with the
Government and other stakeholders.
104. Participation. On May 5-7, 2003, national consultations were held for the CAS in Yaoundk.
These consultations were attended by: (i) no less than 19 cabinet members; (ii) civil society, including
about 30 NGOs, faith-based institutions, and the media; and (iii) donors. At the end of these
consultations, there was broad agreement on CAS objectives, outcomes, and its conformity with the
PRSP. The results-based format was particularly appreciated.

(vi) Lessons from the previous CAS
105. A self-evaluation report (CAS Completion Report) has been produced for 1996-2003, confirming
some of the lessons leamed in past CAS completion and progress reports and an OED evaluation and
providing guidance for the development of the current CAS. The three objectives of the previous CAS

-27-

were to (i) consolidate the benefits of the devaluation, (ii) alleviate poverty, and (iii) create a climate
favorable for private sector deve10pment.l~The OED country assistance evaluation for Cameroon, dated
January 2001, noted substantial progress toward the first and third objectives, but less so toward poverty
alleviation. The CAS Completion Report confirmed the lack of progress on poverty reduction, with even
less enthusiasm for progress on private sector development.
106. Growth performance in Cameroon should be enhanced and sustained by support to private
sector development. During the last five years, Cameroon’s GDP growth rate averaged 4.4 percent.
While a positive achievement, this is still far from sufficient to significantly improve living conditions of
the poor, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Indeed, the economic recovery after 1994 had raised per
capita GDP from 58 percent of its pre-depression 1986 peak level in 1994 to only 63 percent in 1999. And
the economic outlook with declining oil revenues calls for a rapid and deep diversification of the
economy.
107. Improved governance and sustained reform will affect private investments and the level of
IFC activity. IFC investments and advisory services expanded significantly in the last CAS period,
although the aggregate amounts are biased by the pipeline project. IFC was able to support privatization
through investments in banking-and private infrastructure through the SONEL privatization and the
Orange Cameroon cellular telephone operator. But overall investment levels have been low relative to the
size of the economy, reflecting low private investment levels (except where major new sectors are
opened, as in power and telecom.) IFC’s ability to increase its activity will depend on sustained progress
in implementing reforms, addressing long-standing issues to improve the investment climate, and seeking
innovative means of structuring private participation in infrastructure. All will be key to achieving higher
GDP growth rates and more broad-based growth.
108. Growth needs to be anchored on the poor. As mentioned above, GDP growth will affect the
poor only if income redistribution mechanisms are in place and poor households are part of the growth
process. The agricultural sector has potential for higher productivity, while encompassing the poorest.

109. The World Bank program needs to complement conditionality with investment operations.
Current success in transport reform, though fragile, is in part due to the combined structural conditionality
and investment lending, giving substance to the reforms. .
110. A consistent and sustained country dialogue is important in getting results. Substantive and
sustainable improvements in governance are possible even in sectors previously corrupt, such as forestry.
World Bank Group advice on delicate reforms must focus on simple, but important, objectives to engage
authorities for the long term, reaching consensus over time. Sustained communication on difficult issues
is critical in building confidence and trust, especially when firm messages need to be delivered. It is also
essential to escalate complex, delicate issues to the highest level of Government, even when political and
economic power are involved. The World Bank Group needs to engage the Government and civil society
(including private business) in a collegial way, and gather commitment from many levels in the country,
supplementing dialogue at the top with support, outreach, and communication. The interactive processes
that accompanied the forest reform in Cameroon helped convey that complex sector reforms require
national reformers, deep Bank Group knowledge of the issues, a clear understanding of associated
political and economic dimensions, and a strategy to involve other constituencies.

(vii) Lessons of IDA’S and IFC’s portfolios
111, IDA’Sportfolio in Cameroon is in major transition. With 9 active projects, the current portfolio is
rather small. The average implementation period is 3.5 years, but this average hides some bunching that is
13

There was little change in the revised interim strategy, whose objectives were to complete the previous program and
support second-generation reforms.

-28-

difficult to manage. Five projects accounting for 60 percent of the total portfolio (including SACIII,
instrumental in moving the reform agenda forward) are expected to close before the end of FY04. This
CAS aims at consolidating the first-generation reforms while promoting a governance reform agenda for
the long term, so building a stronger portfolio, better spread out, becomes critical.

112. A CPPR, undertaken in December 2002, highlighted the problems with project implementation:
mainly delays in procurement and disbursement, inadequate capacity in project implementation units, and
shortcomings in project supervision. A bi-monthly meeting between the MINEPAT and the project teams
on the Government side, and the Country Manager with relevant field staff on the World Bank side,
makes it possible to address problems in the portfolio in a timely manner-and to identify and address
recurrent issues, such as bottlenecks in procurement. This effort, initiated in early 2002, will be
intensified as part of the followup to the recommendations of the CPPR. In July 2002, a financial
specialist joined the procurement specialist in the YaoundC Country Office.
113. IFC investments have experienced some of the administrative burden and red tape that all
investors are exposed to. Disbursements on the BICEC investment have been delayed for two years,
pending Government approval of the individual Cameroonian shareholders. Delays on disbursement of up
to six months were experienced in the Orange Cameroon project, pending receipt of a simple comfort
letter from the relevant ministry on the continuity of government policy. Liquidation and disposition of
troubled investments, typically the smaller direct investments financed under the African Enterprise Fund,
has been time-consuming and frustrating to IFC lawyers and workout teams, leading them to accept
unsatisfactory outcomes simply to avoid the high transaction costs and delays.

VII. RESULTS-BASED

MONITORING & EVALUATION

1 14. Country capacity in results-based M&E. Information management and decision-making are
focused on the administrative process of expenditures and activities rather than on outcomes, impacts, and
goals. A major challenge for Cameroon is ensuring that policies and budget allocations are informed by a
sustainable M&E system that promotes public accountability. Specific issues include:
*Policy formulation, work planning, and budgeting are undertaken as separate exercises at the sector
and subnational levels.
*The link between spending and outcomes is insufficient.
*A wide range of institutions is involved in inspection and audit, but there is no institutional capacity
to link public spending to service delivery outcomes and results.
*Reporting is fragmented, and the large volume of reporting has little outcome-oriented information,
such as the effectiveness of actually public spending.
*It is unclear from the PRSP what the institutional arrangements for participatory monitoring will be
and how communities will participate directly in the assessment of needs, the definition of
actions, and the evaluation of impacts.
*The links between central data collection and analysis need to be addressed, and the monitoring of
inputs, outputs, and outcomes needs to be done at the local level.
*Data collection needs to be strengthened to ensure a timely and frequent publication.
*The selected PRSP monitoring indicators need to refined to reflect urban-rural and regional
dimensions, and indicators for monitoring security, women’s rights, and gender equality need
more emphasis.
1 15. The Bank Group is planning to continue support for improvements in Cameroon’s M&E capacity
through its Public Sector Reform Agenda, IDF grants, AAA in economic monitoring, and as a cross-

-29-

cutting element of various operations. This will include support for statistical capacity -building (see
paragraph 5 1).
116. Monitoring CAS implementation. The results framework establishes the results chain for the
Bank’s program and augments the traditional monitoring of progress on inputs and deliveries with a focus
on outputs and outcomes, linked to longer-term country outcomes. The CAS has identified a set of
outcome and output indicators to measure progress (column 3 and 4 of the matrices in Annex 1). In most
cases, these indicators are quantified with expected target ranges-and in some cases, more qualitative
information needs to be derived. Where there are gaps in information, the Bank will work with the
Government in identifying specific measurements of outcomes during the first year of CAS.
117. The Bank’s CPPR will be aligned with the results framework, assessing progress in achieving the
main CAS outcomes and outputs, dealing with risks and problems that might hinder achievement of the
outcomes, and identiQing systemic issues that may affect the portfolio. At mid term, the CAS progress
report will draw on an in-depth examination of the CAS outcomes and assess whether they remain
relevant to the longer term objectives, given country conditions. A completion report, similar to the one
provided in Annex 3, will be completed to feed into the next CAS cycle.
118. Data link to the PRSP. Table 3 shows the links to the main areas of the PRSP and the results
framework. Where possible, the CAS will use data collection mechanisms already in use in monitoring
the PRSP (chapter 5 of the PRSP), mainly for higher order outcomes. For other more detailed or
aggregated indicators, the PRSP does not provide all the necessary information. In many instances, this
information will be provided either through administrative data in the line ministries, or within the
management of projects. For instance, the CDD operation will provide information on improvements in
service delivery of local communities in the four regions of Bank Group involvement.
119. Managing for results. While specific operations are planned against the outcomes defined in the
results matrix, the CAS will remain dynamic, responding to changes in the country and the need to
redirect resources. If Cameroon should move to the high-case or low-case scenario, the Bank Group will
adjust the monitoring framework to take into account the potential impact of moving from the base case.
The Bank Group will also support the Government in improving its management towards results. Pillar 1
directly supports improving capacity in government for expenditure management and through other
operations.

VIII. MANAGING
RISKS
120. Political turmoil, either national or regional. Cameroon is considered a safer haven than many
of its more turbulent neighbors, but political stability and security remain priorities in the leadership’s
agenda. Recent tensions in the Central African Republic, and to a lesser extent in Nigeria and Chad, can
affect Cameroon, on the economic front and on the political front. And persistent poverty, with high
ethnic diversity, can be a threat to internal stability. More generally, Cameroon is still a country under
democratic transition, with the attendant risks.
121. Lukewarm implementation. The central PRSP scenario assumes that the Government
implements the reform programs as described in the PRSP. A risk to the strategy is lukewarm
implementation. If this were to materialize, the macroeconomic scenario would essentially continue the
growth trends of the past five years (1997-2001), where the reform program has been implemented rather
slowly and structural problems have persisted. On the supply side, oil production will continue to decline.
On the demand side, stimulus is expected from increased public expenditure in the context of HIPC and
the implementation of the first years of the PRSP. On the basis of those assumptions, the annual GDP
growth rates would average 5 percent over the next three years. Once the multiplier effects of government
spending have dissipated, growth is projected to regress back to its core rate of 4.5 percent after 2006.
Overall, GDP per capita would increase on average by 1.5 percent per year over the next decade.

-30-

Sensitivity analysis on key projection parameters (elasticity, variance of the mean growth rate) indicate
that under the current growth scenario, Cameroon would not meet the MDG of halving poverty by 2015.
122. Important assumptions. The PRSP and the related MTEF rest on important assumptions. If
these do not materialize, successful implementation of the PRSP could be compromised. For example,
external shocks (terms of trade, low foreign resources inflow) or internal factors (persistent structural
problems, energy shortages) that would adversely impact GDP would also reduce domestic and external
resource availability and compromise the priority spending program. The PRSP assesses the adverse
effects of these factors on the sustainability of the strategy (Annex 2). The close macroeconomic

dialogue with the IMF under the PRGF will help mitigate some of these risks, notably those
associated with external shocks.

123. Lack of political will. The political commitment of the Cameroonian Govemment for reforms
will be tested in achieving the HIPC completion point. Once the HIPC completion point is achieved,
there is risk of losing political momentum for further reform. It is expected that sustained focus on
governance issues, and further deepening the partnership, not just with the Government but also with civil
society and the donor community, will mitigate some of the risks. While political risks cannot be directly
influenced, World Bank Group support for PRSP implementation, including capacity-building needs, in
concert with development'partners, will help mitigate some of these risks. In particular, the focus on
improving transparency and accountability in public financial management and service delivery will help
keep the governance agenda at center stage.

Ix. CONCLUDING REMARKS

124. The next three years will be critical for Cameroon. The country has made significant progress in
the implementation of its first-generation macro and structural reforms. It now needs to accelerate
implementation of the governance agenda and take full advantage of the HIPC initiative to promote
economic growth and improve the quality of life of its people. The World Bank Group will continue to
provide full support for Cameroon's efforts to this end.

ANNEX2 - MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK

I - A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE CENTRAL MACROECONOMIC SCENARIO OF THE PRSP
1.
Sources of growth. The PRSP has developed in great detail an ambitious medium-term strategy
for diversifying the economy and accelerating growth in order to fight poverty. The thrust of the strategy
is to enhance competitiveness and promote a supporting environment for export-oriented and private
sector-led economic diversification and growth. Agriculture will continue to drive the economy and
specifically support a broader rural development. Progressively though, diversification will intensify in
favor of a more dynamic industrial sector (fruit and vegetable processing, wood transformation, textile
etc.) and high value service activities (tourism, transport and telecommunication). Improved
competitiveness will be the result of structural reform policies, but also aggressive policies in favor of
infrastructure service development (particularly transport and water) and human resources development
and valorization (education, health, employment, etc.).

Aariculture: Cameroon’s agricultural potential is substantial and can provide a much higher
standard of living to both its rural and urban populations. This would be achieved through improved
productivity as well as area expansion and intensification. The supply-enhancing policies, coupled with
favourable demand conditions, would boost agricultural production. In particular, Cameroon enjoys a
vigorous and increasing demand for food products from its rapidly expanding urban population,
neighbouring Nigeria as well as from oil-rich/arable-land-scarcecountries of the region (Chad, Equatorial
Guinea, Gabon, Angola, etc.). Consequently, the authorities have projected medium-term growth in the
food sector around 4 percent per year by 2010 (Le. roughly 2 point above the performance of the past
decade). With cash crops growth rate remaining around the trend of the past five years or so
(approximately 3 percent per year), and development of new export products (peppers, ginger, onions,
watermelon, etc.), overall agricultural GDP is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 4 percent in
the medium run.

Annex 2 - Macroeconomic Framework

-2-

3.
Forestrv Sector: The forestry sector is the largest non-public sector employer and the most
important non-oil export sector. Cameroon exports the highest volume and value of wood among African
countries. It also possesses the greatest wood processing capacity in Africa, 3 million cubic meters, the
second being South Africa. In addition to a large estate of forests set aside for biodiversity conservation,
Cameroon still has significant forest resources suitable for long term timber production. From timberbased, the forests’ contribution to economic growth is likely to gradually shift towards a broader range of
forestry products and environmental services. Thanks to recent reforms (including competitive award of
concessions, introduction of mandatory management plans and strengthening of forest revenue collection
and management capability), the contribution of the forestry sector to the rural and national economy is
expected to continue to increase over the next decade. While log production is expected to remain
constant or decrease, overall sector growth is estimated at 4 percent per year over the 2006-1 5 period. The
wood processing industry is expected to expand towards secondary processing thanks to improvements in
the overall investment climate and a continued emphasis on incentives to local processing. Given the
direct links on local and national revenues and on employment, overall sector growth is expected to result
in marked improvements in the contribution of forestry to both local and central revenues.
4.
Industry: With improved competitiveness, Cameroon has the potential to become a sub-regional
industrial base, especially in the context of the CEMAC and with growing demand from neighbouring
Nigeria. The GOC is determined to foster industrialization as means for expanding export, raising mean
growth rate and reducing its variance and thus the extent of income fluctuation and economic
vulnerability. Government studies on the sources of growth indicate that Cameroon does have
comparative advantage in a number of branches including wood transformation and agro-industry (such
as textile, beverages, poultry), and that this could be enhanced by competitive policies (lowering factor,
infrastructure services and general transaction costs). Future growth will revolve around small and
medium enterprises (SMEs), which appear to be the most vibrant agents of pro-poor growth. The GOC
intends to support its industrial strategy with a number of specific cross-cutting and sectoral policies. One
is the acceleration of regional integration with a revitalized CEMAC Custom Union (see section on
regional integration). Other GOC policies in support of industrial development are: (i) the development
of physical infrastructure, especially transport and energy, (ii) promotion of a business friendly climate
that is attractive to foreign investment (including combating fraud, promoting competition and fighting
corruption), and (iii) improving the legal and the regulatory framework for private businesses. The above
reform programs, coupled with increased public investment in the priority sectors (health, education and
the rural sector), are expected to raise average growth rate in manufacturing to around 10 percent by
20 10, thus increasing the contribution of industry to 8 percent of overall GDP.
Box 1 - A multisector macroeconometric model
The GOC has projected a medium-term growth profile using a detailed multisector and macro econometric
endogenous growth model. The model was developed by GOC, with technical assistance from the World Bank and
UNDP as part of a capacity building project. Sectoral GDPs are projected as function of long-term determinants
(human capital, infrastructure and foreign direct investments), short-term determinants of aggregate demand
(relative prices, terms of trade and income), and exogenous factors (such as specific sectoral policies and programs,
business plans of recently privatised companies). The econometric projections were revised in some cases in order
to take into account additional information derived from the study on the sources of growth. The sectoral growth
profiles were then reviewed in a participatory manner through a series of technical meetings between the macro unit
and the priority sector teams, especially education, health, infrastructure and the rural sector. The objective was to
assure consistency between the sectoral strategies and the macroeconomic framework.

Combining the above tools and process, the GOC has provided a detailed macroeconomic and medium-term
expenditure framework for the PRSP. The GOC acknowledges that achieving such a sustained growth performance
will entail speeding up the implementation of structural reforms, intensifying investment in human resources and
physical infrastructures, and significantly improving governance. This would lower factor cost, raise productivity
and create a business-friendly environment, which would attract foreign investment and accelerate private sector-led
diversification and growth.

5.
Services: The service sector will accompany growth in the primary and secondary sectors (trade,
transport, telecom). Additional stimulus is expected from strong public expenditure in the priority sectors
(with released HIPC expenditure), renewed investment in the telecom sector following the expected
privatisation of CAMTEL, and increased dynamism of the financial sector with the opening of the Douala
stock market. These factors account for an expected strong sector growth of 7 percent per year for the
next decade.

Welfare implications. Per-capita consumption remains strong, with a steady rise by 3 percent per
year, which means sustained improvement in household welfare. With the above growth profile, and
taking into account the sectoral decomposition of growth and related differences in the elasticities of
poverty to growth, the projected decrease in the poverty rate is 18 points, which indicates that Cameroon
could meet the MDG target.
7.
Public finances and the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). GOC fiscal policy is
built on expected decline in oil revenue, increased non-oil revenues, rationalization of public expenditures
and a better targeting of spending toward priority sectors. Total revenues are expected to decline slightly
in the coming years from 19.4 percent in 2003 to 18.8 percent of GDP by the end of 2007 as a result of
expected decline in oil revenue from 4.8 percent in 2003 to 2 percent in 2007. The projected shortfall in
oil revenue will be partially offset by increase in non-oil revenue, which is projected to reach 16.8 percent
of GDP in 2007. The overall fiscal balance (excluding grants) will stabilize around +1 percent of GDP.

Non-oil revenue mobilization. The increase in non-oil revenue is mostly based on a broadening
of the tax base and improved efficiency of the tax and customs systems as a result of the ongoing
structural reform program. With regards to the domestic tax system, measures to broaden the tax base
include: (i) expansion of the tax payer master file and the establishment of a large tax payers’ unit; (ii)
reduction of the number of exempted items under the VAT system and the special tax system for
petroleum products and a stricter enforcement of the exemption system; (iii) introduction of a new income
tax law for individual taxpayers as of January lSt2004; (iv) the new property tax system in YaoundC and
Douala based on a land survey that should be implemented as of 2005; and (v) the securization of specific
taxes (forestry, mines etc). The tax Directorate is also taking some administrative measure to reinforce the
fight against tax fraud. In the customs area, measures will be taken to: (i) further strengthen the single
processing window for external trade; (ii) improve the physical and documentary controls for the release
of goods and enhance the control system for exemptions and special status traffic; and (iii) facilitate the
exchange of information between the tax and customs administrations (establishing a computer link and
strengthening the cellule impbts douanes).
9.
Public expenditures are projected to stabilize around 17.5 percent of GDP, which would allow the
GOC to meet sectoral objectives while maintaining financial prudence. Table 4 on medium-term
expenditure allocation shows a steady increase in spending on PRSP priority areas, especially education,
health, social welfare, infrastructure and the rural sector.
10.
Indicating government commitment to human resource development, public expenditure on
education and health will steadily rise to reach 4 and 1.5 percent of GDP in 2007. Developing basic
infrastructure is also an important PRSP goal for improving competitiveness as well as for enhancing
access for the poor. The MTEF indicates that the GOC is determined to commit a significant share of
resources (1 5 percent of total internal budget and 2.7 percent of GDP) to the infrastructure sector.

11.
As indicated before, the main priority sector ministries have also prepared detailed MTEFs,
which have been aligned on the macro framework through the above budget envelope. In particular, the
Education and Health Ministries have prepared detailed medium-term expenditure framework which
spelled-out the main programs and related activities and financing needs over the 2003/07 period. A
similar work is underway for Public Works as well as for the Rural Sector.

11 - RISK ANALYSIS
12.
The PRSP scenario and related MTEF also rest on a number of important assumptions, which if
not realized, could jeopardize successful implementation of the PRSP. For example, external shocks
(terms of trade, low foreign resources inflow, etc.) or internal factors (persisting structural problems,
energy shortage, etc.) that would adversely impact GDP would also reduce domestic and external
resource availability and compromise the priority spending program. The PRSP provides an assessment
of the adverse effects of the above factors on the sustainability of the strategy (Cf. table 5). The Poverty
impact analysis was done by linking the 123PRSP model to the macroeconometric model of the Direction
de la Prevision. This has allowed to assess the impact of various shocks and policies on the income
distribution of the poorest and richest households.

Adverse terms of trade shocks. As noted before, the Cameroonian economy has remained
13.
largely dependant on few exported commodities, mainly oil, wood and cocoa. These commodities have
experienced important price volatility over the past two decades, as indicated by relatively large
coefficients of variation (175 percent for cotton, 42 percent for wood, 20 percent for oil and cocoa). The
central scenario of the PRSP was based on a modest annual increase in the term of trade over the next 3
years. The GOC has estimated that, other things being equal, a drop in the oil price of 20 percent in 2003,
10 percent in 2004 and 5 percent until 2007 would result in an annual -0.6 point decrease in GDP growth

Annex 2 - Macroeconomic Framework

-6-

rate relative to the reference scenario over the 2003-07 period. This would translate into a substantial
shortfall in revenue and force the government to curtail annual spending by as much as 37 billions CFAF
over the period, including in priority areas, thus compromising PRSP objectives. Household income
would also be adversely affected, declining by a total of 2.8 points in 2007 relative to the baseline.
However, the impact is more severe on the 20 percent poorest households whose income suffers a sharper
decline (3.1 points) relative to the richest quintile (2.3 points).
14.
Foreign assistance hold-up or low-absorption capacity. Cameroon would also depend on the
assistance of donor countries and agencies in supporting its effort to reduce poverty during the next
decade. The government has identified the financing needs associated to the central scenario of the DSRP.
In the event that anticipated additional donor support does not materialize, the government would need to
revise the sectoral objectives and spending allocation as well as the overall growth profile. Simulations
indicate that a 50 percent reduction of external resources would reduce annual GDP growth by 0.6
percent, so that real GDP would stabilize around 5 percent instead of 6 percent. Also, assuming that
external resources are available, failure to absorb them will reduce growth and adversely impact the social
sectors. Simulations results indicated that if the rate of absorption of current and capital expenditure were
only 94 percent and 66 percent percent, growth will average 4.4 percent instead of 5 percent in the
previous scenario over the 2002-2007 period.
15.
Persistent problems in energy supply. Were ongoing electricity shortages to persist, the
competitiveness of the industrial sector and the expected diversification of the economy would fail to
materialize, condemning the country to a low and volatile primary-commodity dependent growth profile.
Simulations results indicated that a “timid” implementation of the investment plan in the energy sector
based on a 50 percent reduction in programmed investment in the sector would lead to a 0.5 point lower
annual growth rate over the 2004-07 period.

REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
1996 CAS COMPLETION
REPORT

Country: Cameroon

Date of CAS: January 12, 1996
Date of First Progress Report: February 18, 1998
Date of Second Progress Report: May 25,2000

Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: FY96 - FY02
CAS Completion Report
Completed by:

Cynthia Cook, Consultant
Madani M. Tall, Country Manager
Date: May 27, 2003

1.
This CAS Completion Report evaluates the effectiveness of the Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy for Cameroon (January 1996). Since 1996, two CAS Progress Reports have been presented to
the Board. Lessons learned from the early phases of CAS implementation and consequent adjustments in
the Country Assistance Strategy are reflected in these two reports. Progress in achieving the goals of the
1996 CAS is summarized in Annex A. Annexes B and C compare the planned and actual deliveries of
lending and non-lending support during the three CAS periods under review. Annex D details progress in
achieving CAS outcomes over the CAS period, and Annex E gives some indicators concerning progress
toward Cameroon’s long-term goals.
2.
In the twenty-five years following independence (1960- 1985), Cameroon showed strong
economic growth. However, from 1985 on, the world oil crisis and declining world prices for Cameroon’s
major export crops caused a dramatic drop in government revenues, while public expenditures and public
debt continued to grow. In 1988 the Government launched an economic reform program supported by an
IMF Stand-by and a Structural Adjustment Loan from the Bank. However, it proved impossible to
restore Cameroon’s competitive position through internal adjustment and trade liberalization. In 1993 the
Government cut wages in the civil service in half, and in January 1994, all the CFA franc countries
devalued their currency by 50 percent. An Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) was approved by the Board
in June 1994. Although the ERC reform agenda was mainly implemented, it became clear that sectoral
reforms could achieve little in a macroeconomic environment still marked by poor management of public
finances and large internal and external debts.
The 1996 CAS aimed at supporting the unfinished adjustment agenda for Cameroon and
3.
returning the country to a growth path. It recognized that additional debt relief would be needed to
sustain growth in the long run. In the meantime, the CAS stated that Cameroon should aim at restoring its
creditworthiness through vigorous export promotion, fiscal revenue mobilization, and restructuring of the
financial sector. The CAS highlighted findings of the 1994 Poverty Assessment and suggested what
might be the main components of a poverty reduction strategy. In addition to financial sector reforms, it
recognized the importance of regulatory and judicial reforms to create an enabling environment for
private sector development.
4.
The CAS Completion Report concludes that the Bank’s assistance program was relevant to short
term country objectives which were seen by both the Bank and the Government as prerequisites to
achieve longer term goals of poverty reduction and sustainable development. It assisted the Government
to make and implement politically difficult decisions in a challenging economic and social climate.
Significant progress was achieved on the macro front; since 1996, there have now been nearly seven

Annex 3 - CAS Completion Report

-2-

years of uninterrupted good performance on the macro and structural front (annual growth of 4.0 percent
to 5.5 percent). However, progress in the different development sectors was uneven. In some areas,
notably the “social” sectors, little progress was made during the period under review. However, the
dialogue on poverty reduction was initiated, broadened and deepened over this period.
A.

Long-Term Strategic Goals

5.
The 1996 CAS described the Government’s long-term objectives as (1) to create a democratic
society within an ethnically diverse context, in which per capita income would at least double within
twenty years,’ and (2) food securityS2The Government recognized the need to restore fiscal balance and
confidence in political and financial institutions in order to regain the momentum of growth based on
private sector investment. The CAS mentions the results of the Poverty Assessment conducted by the
Bank in 1994 but does not indicate any intention of the Government to address the issues raised in this
assessment.

6.
The Government’s short-term strategy is described in the CAS as (1) keeping the government
current on its interest payment obligations, and ( 2 ) implementing a comprehensive privatization and
financial sector reform program. The logic of these short-term objectives was that sustained international
debt service, divestiture of the State from public enterprises, and restructuring of the financial sector, were
all prerequisites to the return of foreign capital inflows, which were expected to restore the momentum of
growth and eventually to create conditions under which poverty reduction would become financially
feasible. The logic was that of growth eventually “trickling down” to lift ever-larger segments of the
population out of poverty. The Millenium Development Goals were not yet a part of the Bank’s dialogue
with its borrowers.
7.
The CAS recognized the political and social tensions inherent in Cameroon’s situation and the
risks that these posed for the successful execution of a reform program. It acknowledged that key reforms
needed to restore confidence in the private sector had not yet been accomplished. It also mentioned
“long-entrenched corruption” as a potential problem, both in itself and as a factor tending to undermine
donor support and the prospects for foreign direct investment. Over the CAS period, the governance
factor became ever more visible as an obstacle to growth and poverty reduction, and increasing attention
was devoted to it by the Government and by the Bank team.
8.
In retrospect, the Bank made a significant contribution towards achieving the Government’s longterm growth goal through its analytical work, which helped to establish clear intermediate targets and
action plans, and through its policy dialogue, which helped to expand the constituency for reform in the
country. The Bank provided extensive implementation support, both technical and financial, which
helped the Government to achieve most of its short-term goals. The goal of civil service reform was
partially achieved through a significant reduction of the wage bill. However, the efficiency and
effectiveness of the civil service was not notably improved. The Bank also engaged the Government in
broadening the planning process to include the private sector and civil society, and to improve the focus
on poverty reduction.

1
The baseline for this target is not specified in the CAS. According to the “African Development Indicators” of 2002,
GNI per capita in 1996 was Us$620.

It seems that the term “food security,” as used in Cameroon, may be interpreted as a proxy for “poverty reduction,” Le.
the idea that everyone ought to have enough to eat. It does not mean food self-sufficiency; it is recognized that Cameroon’s
early economic success derived from its ability to move from smallholder food crop production to market-oriented export crop
production.

CAS Outcomes

9.
CAS Objectives. The Bank’s goal, as expressed in the 1996 CAS, was to help Cameroon recover
lost ground in economic and social development as quickly as possible, while further restructuring its
economy to remain competitive in a rapidly changing world. The three pillars of the Bank’s strategy were
(i) consolidating the benefits of devaluation through improved public resource management, (ii)
alleviating poverty, and (iii) creating a climate favorable for private sector development. The CAS
envisaged a gradual shift from adjustment to investment lending, with more policy discussion than in the
past, and with reduced IDA lending complemented by greater efforts in mobilizing and coordinating
support from other donors. The Bank would work closely with the IMF in helping to stabilize
Cameroon’s public finances, and with IFC and MIGA in helping to mobilize private investment. Another
important feature of the CAS was strengthening the staffing of the Resident Mission (now Country
Office) to broaden consensus around the reform agenda.
10.
The CAS identified a number of “actions required” to achieve its objectives. These could be
viewed as the intended outcomes of Bank assistance. Some performance indicators were also suggested,
although these were not systematically related to the proposed actions. No target dates were established,
and only a few indicators were expressed in objectively measurable terms. This matrix, which was used in
the 1998 and 2000 Progress Reports to track progress on the CAS action program, is reproduced in Annex
D.
Consolidating the benefits of devaluation. The first “pillar” had as an overarching goal the
11.
improvement of macroeconomic stability and public finance, through increasing resource mobilization,
improving the quality of public expenditure, reforming procurement practices, settling domestic debt
arrears, divesting the State of productive activities, and deepening the civil service reform program
initiated under the ERC. Macroeconomic stability and more efficient and transparent management of
public finance were seen as prerequisites for generating public savings and attracting private capital to put
Cameroon back on a growth path. The proposed performance indicators included the revenue to GDP
ratio, the share of priority sectors in public expenditure, and completion of staffing plans (part of the
unfinished agenda for civil service reform).
12.
The 1998 CAS Update reported “substantial progress” on increasing resource mobilization,
reduction of the public wage bill, and privatization of public enterprises. Tax revenues and transfers from
public enterprises had increased, and external debt arrears had been eliminated. The budget surplus
reached 5.8 percent of GDP in FY97. However, tax administration remained weak and the budget was
still too dependent on oil revenues. The privatization program was proceeding well. A substantial
reduction had been accomplished in the civil service and the corresponding wage bill. In contrast, only
partial progress had been made in settling domestic arrears, and little progress in improving the
management of public expenditure.
13.
The 2000 CAS Update reported continued substantial progress on resource mobilization, with
fiscal revenues projected to be 19.1 percent of GDP in FYOO, compared to 15.1 percent in FY97 and 10.1
percent in FY94. The share of non-oil revenues had also increased. Substantial progress was also
reported with the privatization program. The settlement of domestic arrears was ongoing. Little further
progress had been made on the civil service reform program; a new civil service reform strategy was to
be prepared. Also, little progress had been made on improving public expenditure management,
procurement, public financial information, or governance.

14.
Cameroon reached the HIPC Decision Point in September 2000 and became eligible for interim
HIPC funding. Excluding HIPC spending, in recent years the govemment has maintained a surplus in the
primary fiscal balance, despite declining oil revenues. Inflation has been contained at an average of 3.5

percent per year from 1997 to 2000, but now shows signs of rising in response to high food prices. No
further progress has been made on civil service reform.
15.
The instruments foreseen to help the Government consolidate the benefits of devaluation included
two adjustment credits originally programmed for FY96 and FY97. The first would support budgetary
and financial reforms; the second would focus on privatization of parastatals and private sector
development. On the non-lending front, a CEM was planned in FY97, and PERs would be completed on
an annual basis. The underlying logic of this strategy was that the financial and technical support
provided by adjustment credits, with disbursements linked to specific policy reforms, together with
intensive policy dialogue, would be sufficient to bring about significant improvements in public financial
management and the incentive framework for private investment, which in turn would engender growth
and generate resources for poverty alleviation.
16.
SAC I1 was delivered as planned in FY96, followed by two Fifth Dimension credits in FY96 and
FY97. The major macroeconomic objectives supported by SAC I1 were eventually achieved. However,
the civil service reforms had a serious negative impact on morale, motivation, and integrity in the civil
service. Progress in the reorganization of ministries was slower than anticipated. Government arrears to
banks were securitized, but the settlement of other domestic arrears did not make much progress.
Although the objective of completing the privatization program was not achieved, good progress was
made. Disbursements on SAC I1 were suspended in mid-1996 when the fourth IMF Standby
Arrangement went off track. However, SAC I1 was disbursed in full in August 1997 (compared with an
original closing date of March 1997), upon approval of the IMF PRGF, following successful completion
of a one-year staff monitored IMF Program.
17.
SAC 111 was approved in June 1998. Its design was more complex than that of SAC 11. The
macroeconomic program included two tranches focused on continued improvements in revenue
mobilization, controlling inflation, reforming social security, and completing the settlement of domestic
arrears. In addition, there were four “floating tranches” related to reforms in the transport and forestry
sectors and actions needed to advance the privatization program. This design was intended to maintain
flexibility in financing while remaining firm on the need to fully satisfy the conditionality for each
tranche. Only four tranches have been released, with considerable delays. The first macro tranche was
released on effectiveness in September 1998, and the second macro tranche in June 2000. The forestry
sector tranche and the first privatization tranche have been released, but the second privatization tranche
and the transport sector tranche remain outstanding. The former is expected to be released by June 2003,
and the latter by September 2003. Delays can be explained by the technical and political complexity of
the reforms, the continuing reluctance of the Cameroon authorities, and the advent of the HIPC Initiative,
which consumed much of the energy of the Government and the World Bank Team after September 1999.
18.
The agenda of non-lending activities in support of this pillar was not carried out as planned. A
series of short “Issues Notes” were prepared in FY99 for internal Bank discussion, but were never
discussed with Government. Instead, increasing concern about governance and corruption led the Bank to
conduct an unplanned Country Procurement and Audit Review and a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment, as well as a Governance Overview, in the years covered by the 2000 CAS Update. These
activities were intended to underpin a continuing dialogue with Government in an attempt to improve the
management of public expenditures and thereby enhance the environment for growth. The Governance
Overview assisted the Government in completing its own Governance Strategy as part of the PRSP
preparation process. However, the planned Civil Service Strategy and Judicial Reform Strategy were not
budgeted for or completed.

Annex 3 - CAS Completion Report

19.
In retrospect, the program’s reliance on structural adjustment lending combined with technical
assistance was reasonably successful in supporting the macroeconomic management pillar of the CAS.
Some of the desired outcomes, such as increasing resource mobilization and privatization of public
enterprises, were substantially achieved. Others, such as eliminating internal arrears, took longer to
accomplish than initially expected. Civil service reform stalled after the initial reduction in force.
Extensive dialogue took place on improving public expenditure management and procurement, but little
real progress could be observed over the CAS period. In summary, the strategy of support for
Cameroon’s structural adjustment program worked where the Government was firmly committed to
implementing the program, but failed where Government did not really want to change.
20.
Borrower performance in re-establishing macroeconomic stability was generally satisfactory.
Quantitative targets were achieved, international debt obligations were met, and a number of structural
reforms were made, especially in the area of divestiture of state enterprises. The small group of reformers
in the Ministry of Finance gained credibility and clout, and the political regime was strengthened by
economic success. However, Borrower performance in the area of public expenditure management
continued to be disappointing, and civil service reforms were not fully implemented. The area of
governance came to be the main focus of policy dialogue and Bank non-lending support, in parallel with
an increasing emphasis on poverty alleviation.
21.
Poverty alleviation. The second “pillar” of the 1996 CAS was poverty alleviation. The CAS
objective was to put poverty alleviation at the center of the Government’s development strategy. This
goal was not aligned with the Government’s own priorities. Rather, it aimed to alter the Government’s
priorities. Poverty alleviation was present in the Government’s agenda but as a secondary objective,
which would be accomplished as a result of the return to growth.
22.
The CAS identified four poverty-related objectives which it hoped would be achieved in the
“sustained adjustment scenario.” These included providing (a) adequate education and (b) appropriate
health services (to the poor), and generating employment through (c) private sector-led growth and (d)
labor intensive (public) works. To accomplish these objectives, eight outcomes were identified, which
the Government was expected to achieve under the sustained adjustment scenario. These outcomes,
drawn from the 1994 Poverty Assessment, include:
promote sustainable and employment-generating growth;
reallocate budgetary resources towards priority sectors;
improve access to primary education and health services;
promote employment generating programs with a special focus on rural areas;
increase availability of financial services for the poor;
promote food production, processing and marketing;
reduce inter-regional income disparities;
monitor evolution of poverty.
23.
Two performance indicators for progress in poverty reduction were mentioned in the 1996 CAS:
(i) an increase of at least 3.5 percent per year in nominal terms in budgets for the education and health
sectors; and (ii) establishment of an efficient mechanism to reach local communities. No indicators were
proposed to measure progress toward the other outcomes. The first indicator, while measurable, proved
not to be a meaningful indicator of performance on poverty-oriented expenditure, let alone on poverty
reduction. “Budgetary reallocation” was achieved, but it proved impossible to determine if this was
translated into increased poverty-oriented expenditure. The second indicator was too vague to be

Annex 3 - CAS Completion Report

monitored over time, was not clearly linked to any of the desired outcomes, and was certainly not
accomplished during the CAS p e r i ~ d . ~
24.
Poverty in Cameroon increased from 40 percent in 1984 to 51 percent in 1994, as a result of the
economic crisis. The 1994 Poverty Assessment anticipated that poverty would increase further in the
short run as a result of recent cuts in civil service wages and the devaluation. The 1996 Household
Budget Survey confirmed a peak level of poverty at 53 percent. The restoration of macroeconomic
stability and renewed growth led to a gradual reduction of income poverty over the latter part of the CAS
period. A second Household Budget Survey in 200 1 showed that poverty had dropped substantially in the
1996-2001 period, from 53 percent to 40 percent. However, the same survey confirmed that growth has
not brought significant benefits to the “core poor,” regional disparities remain, and inequality remains
high, especially in rural areas. Other social indicators (not included in the CAS) have declined over time,
indicating a failure to achieve almost all of the CAS objectives on poverty alleviation, except for the one
on poverty monitoring. (See Annex E)
25.
The 1998 and 2000 CAS Updates reported little progress on the poverty alleviation agenda. As
one of the up-front actions required for SAC 11, budgets were reallocated to place greater emphasis on the
priority sectors for poverty. However, by 2000 it was noted that budget data were inadequate for
monitoring actual expenditures, much less their regional distribution or poverty incidence. As for
promoting sustainable, employment-generating growth, the growth of per capita GDP had not been fast
enough to generate substantial additional employment, nor had there been any particular effort to ensure
that this growth would be “pro-poor”. A slight increase in agricultural productivity was noted, but no
progress had been made on employment creation through public works, on delivering financial services
to the poor, or on reducing inter-regional income disparities. One area where good progress was made
was in poverty monitoring, as a result of the 1996-97 Household Budget Survey and the 1998
Demographic and Health Survey.
26.
The Bank strategy for supporting Government’s efforts in poverty alleviation initially relied on
increasing economic growth combined with targeted interventions in the social sectors. In addition to the
growth expected to be generated by the structural adjustment process, the 1996 CAS included the already
approved Health Project (FY95), a planned Education Project in FY97, and a Social Development Project
in FY98. The logic of this strategy assumed that Government was ready to adopt significant programs of
poverty-oriented public expenditure and to seek IDA financing for such programs. The implementation
of these programs was expected to improve education and health service delivery and consequently to
improve living conditions for the poor. As it turned out, however, the Government was not ready to adopt
and implement such programs. The Health Project performed poorly throughout its lifetime, and the
other projects were postponed or dropped until a satisfactory agreement could be reached with
Government on poverty oriented service delivery strategies and programs.

27.
Also under the heading of poverty alleviation were included a future Agricultural Extension and
Research project, the ongoing GEF project for biodiversity conservation, and assistance to the
Government in preparing its National Environmental Management Plan. The logic here was that
agricultural extension would help improve the productivity of poor farmers, and that improved
environmental management would help protect public assets and improve the living conditions of the
poor in both urban and rural areas. However, the small increase in agricultural production reported in
2000 (2-3 percent) was viewed mainly as a response to trade liberalization and macroeconomic

stabilization, rather than increased effectiveness of the extension services.’ The Biodiversity Project
performed poorly in the early CAS years, but by the end of the CAS period it was being implemented in a
satisfactory manner.
28.
On the non-lending front, sector strategy work would be focused on poverty alleviation, with
Strategy Notes originally programmed in education, rural water supply, rural infrastructure, and rural
finance. In fact, none of these planned non-lending activities was carried out. The 1998 CAS Update
recognized that the Government was not ready to implement real reforms in the priority sectors for
poverty alleviation and that further policy dialogue would be needed before lending in those sectors could
be expected to succeed. It also recognized the need for the Government to develop its own poverty
reduction strategy, rather than simply adopting the strategy proposed by the Bank. A series of short,
analytic notes was then planned to support the dialogue in priority sectors. However, no activity was
foreseen in the key areas of employment generation, rural finance, or gender analysis.
29.
The 2000 CAS Update focused on the Government’s desire to benefit from the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. In response to the 1994 Poverty Assessment, the Government issued a “Poverty Strategy
Declaration” in December 1998, and by 2000 was in the process of preparing a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). The serious and seemingly intractable constraints in the public sector suggested
that the Government should seek to involve the private sector to a greater extent in the delivery of health
and education services. Regional and gender targeting would also be needed to correct historical
disparities in service delivery. The implementation of these reforms would, however, depend on securing
debt relief through the enhanced HIPC initiative.
30.
In September 2000, an Interim PRSP, based on a first round of participatory consultations, was
presented to the Bank’s Board together with the HIPC Document. The Interim PRSP (I-PRSP) stressed
the need for “pro-poor” growth to focus on income-generating, labor-intensive activities, microfinance,
and gender equity. In particular, the I-PRSP consultations raised the focus on rural development as the
key to sustainable poverty reduction. The I-PRSP also highlighted popular concern about HIV/AIDS and
spurred the development of a national strategy involving all sectors to address this issue.
3 1.
The Cameroonian authorities were both challenged and intrigued by Bank proposals to prepare
the PRSP through a broad participatory process. They understood that poverty and exclusion were
detrimental to social cohesion and national unity, which were important though hitherto unspoken pillars
in the national development strategy. At the same time, they realized that “raising the lid” on popular
perceptions could result in rising expectations, confrontation, and potentially open conflict. Participation
methods were therefore carefully chosen to emphasize solidarity rather than social differences.
32.
The planned shift from adjustment to investment lending in support of poverty alleviation was not
accomplished during the CAS period. The poorly performing Health, Fertility and Nutrition Project was
restructured in 1999 and half of the credit was cancelled. The Social Development Project was dropped
from the CAS lending program. The Education Sector Project was first forwarded to FY99 and then
dropped.6 The Agricultural Extension and Research Project was forwarded to FY99. A Forestry and
Environment Project (FY02) was added to the lending program in the 2000 CAS Update. It is currently
scheduled for Board presentation in FY03. Consequently, the Bank was unable to provide the lending

The Agricultural Extension and Research Project was approved only in FY99, so it was perhaps premature to expect a

support originally envisaged for activities aimed at poverty alleviation in Cameroon during the CAS
period.
33.
On the non-lending front, activities originally planned to produce Bank sector strategy notes were
transformed into support for the Government to prepare an Interim PRSP and to initiate the participatory
preparation of sector strategies and expenditure programs for the PRSP itself. Ultimately, Government
strategies were produced with Bank support for Health, Education, Rural Development, and Governance.
The Bank continued to provide informal support to improve forestry management, as well as to improve
social and economic statistics. Finally, the Country Office administered in the period from 1997 to 2000
a Small Grants Fund to support local civil society initiatives.
34.
In fact, the Government has made rather remarkable progress in income poverty reduction over
the CAS period. Poverty levels are basically back to where they were before the depression years.
However, the Government’s capacity to deliver services related to poverty alleviation has declined
dramatically. Continued progress in poverty reduction will be much more difficult to accomplish. It will
require addressing structural deficiencies in the delivery of services and the obstacles faced by the poor in
securing access to assets and employment. It will almost certainly require greater involvement by the
private sector and civil society. In that sense, the accomplishments of the CAS period may not be
sustainable unless the Government seriously embarks upon the “second generation” of reforms identified
in the PRSP, while at the same time increasing the pace of growth and improving the management of
public resources.

Private Sector Development. The third “pillar” of the 1996 CAS was creating an environment
35.
attractive to private sector investment. The CAS established five outcomes it aimed to accomplish in this
area: (i) improving the incentive and regulatory framework; (ii) improving the functioning of the
judiciary system; (iii) reforming the financial sector; (iv) maintaining and developing basic [transport]
infrastructure; and (v) completing the privatization program already started under SAL I and the ERC.
An ambitious list of performance indicators was also established: elimination of monopolies in the
petroleum sector, liberalization of marine transport, phasing out of export taxes, privatization of all large
public enterprises and banks, recovery of loan assets, and maintenance of the road network. Although not
defined in quantitative terms, these were operationally defined, measurable targets, which served as
effective benchmarks for Bank and Government performance.
36.
As a result of this clear definition, and possibly also as a result of the fact that many of these
objectives had already been the subject of extensive policy dialogue with Government over the years
preceding the CAS, substantial progress was achieved in this area, with one exception: little progress was
achieved on judicial reform, The petroleum monopoly was eliminated; international shipping was
liberalized; export taxes were removed; the privatization agenda was largely accomplished, although a
few difficult cases remain to be completed; liquidity was restored to the banking sector; a priority road
network was defined, a Road Fund involving public and private stakeholders was created to finance and
manage road maintenance, and the priority road network has been successfully maintained with
increasing involvement by local contractors.
37.
The policy agenda was well articulated in and strongly supported by the two structural adjustment
credits (SAC I1 and SAC 111) which were the key features of Bank lending over the CAS period. In
addition, the implementation of reforms was supported by a Transport Sector Technical Assistance
Project (FY95), a Privatization Technical Assistance Project (FY96), and a Publidprivate Partnerships
TA Project (FYOO). The implementation of reforms in the financial sector was also supported by a senior
Bank financial specialist assigned to the Resident Mission for the duration.

Annex 3 - CAS Completion Report

-9-

38.
The implementation of the SAC I1 reform program was slower than expected. Consequently, the
delivery date for SAC I11 was shifted from FY97 to FY98. The policy agenda for SAC I11 was also
broadened over this period. Its objective became to support the implementation of the entire program
outlined in the Government's Policy Framework Paper (1997-1999). The policy agenda for SAC I11
included the actions which Government had found it most difficult to undertake, and the logic was that
significant financial flows would be sufficient to induce Government to take the final steps needed to
establish a healthy environment for private sector development. In fact, SAC I11 experienced even more
delays than SAC 11, and its reform agenda is still not entirely implemented.' Completion of the SAC I11
program is a key condition for Cameroon to reach the HIPC Completion Point and gain unrestricted
access to HIPC resources.
39.
A Transport Sector Project was planned and delivered in FY96 to support privatization of stateowned transport companies, ensure the rehabilitation and maintenance of a priority road network, and
implement other sector reforms. The 1998 CAS Update introduced a new project to provide
implementation support for the privatization of the Cameroon Railway, which was finally delivered in
FY03. The logic of these investment operations was that sector lending could improve resource
management, encourage private entrepreneurship, and generate additional revenues which could be used
for poverty alleviation. This approach seems to have succeeded through effective collaboration between
Bank sector staff and Government colleagues.
40.
In collaboration with IFC, the Bank also foresaw lending to Cameroon for its share of equity in
the future Chad/Cameroon Pipeline (FY97). This project ran into difficulties because its first
Environmental Assessment was not acceptable to the Bank and IFC. In particular, the Bank assessed that
neither Cameroon nor Chad had the capacity in place to play the role foreseen for them in the EA in terms
of monitoring the implementation of the Pipeline Project. Consequently, a Capacity Enhancement for
Petroleum Development and Environment (CAPECE) project was added to the Cameroon lending
program in the FY98 CAS Update.' Extensive consultations with civil society on the revised
environmental documentation further delayed these projects, which were finally delivered in FYOO.
41.
The 2000 CAS Progress Report introduced additional capacity building projects to support the
implementation of reforms, including one to promote publidprivate partnerships (FYOO), one to support
commercial bank debt restructuring (FYO I), and one to provide technical assistance to the social sectors
(FYO 1). The publidprivate partnerships project was approved as planned, while the other two projects
were dropped." The Commercial Bank Debt Restructuring Project was replaced with a regional credit to
the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). The $50 million originally
allocated to the two dropped projects was reallocated to an unprogrammed Multisectoral HIV/AIDS
project approved in FYO 1.

42.
Non-lending activities related to private sector development over the CAS period were less
extensive than for the other two pillars, perhaps because the policy dialogue in this area was already well
underway. The Government may also have been more readily convinced and committed to change in this
area, although there was significant resistance to privatization by key stakeholders both inside and outside
8

It seems that port privatization has been the element which caused the greatest delays. In this case, the
Bank may have underestimated both the reluctance of the Government to take action in this area, and the complexity of the new
institutional arrangements which would be needed, in view of new international agreements that came into force in the meantime.
9
10

A similar project was prepared for Chad.

The PublicPrivate Partnerships Project was basically a vehicle to provide technical assistance in a wide variety of areas
to Government to support implementation of the SAC 111 agenda. While it largely supported privatization, it also provided
support for poverty monitoring, development of a new regulatory framework for micro-finance institutions, and social security
reform.

the Government. Informal advice on judicial reform was planned in the 1998 CAS Update, and a
Judiciary Reform Strategy, together with work on Core Labor Standards, was planned in the 2000 CAS
Update. However, these activities were not carried out, and little measurable progress has yet been
achieved in this area.
43.
In retrospect, the mix of lending and non-lending activities for this area was appropriate and
successful in achieving most of the desired outcomes. (See Annex D.) Policy dialogue and financial
incentives through adjustment operations were important in generating government commitment in the
early stages. Successful implementation of key initial reforms created the momentum for further
progress. The policy dialogue was strongly supported by technical assistance and, when appropriate,
investment operations. The only area where little progress was achieved was judicial reform."

44.
Borrower performance on the private sector pillar of the CAS was generally good, although there
were, as always, delays both in the implementation of reforms and in the execution of investment
projects. The reform program placed heavy demands on the Government in terms of institutional capacity
and changing institutional mandates. The provision of informal Bank advice as well as project technical
assistance helped to build capacity and transform good intentions into effective action on the ground.
Combining clearly defined and time-bound action programs with investment support once reforms had
been achieved proved to be a successful strategy for achieving change.
45.
It appears likely that the progress achieved over the CAS period in building a favorable
environment for private sector development will be sustained. The restoration of growth and the
reduction of poverty which have been achieved over this period can only strengthen the hand of reformers
who promoted private sector development and weaken those who opposed it. Though reforms have
challenged some key constituencies which benefited from the old way of doing things, they have spread
the benefits of growth beyond the political elite and significantly strengthened the role of the commercial
and industrial middle classes. Because of the limited investment response, however, these reforms have
yet to benefit the poor in a significant way.
46.
Additional CAS Objectives. During the extended CAS implementation period, two additional
issues gained prominence as potential obstacles to the achievement of Cameroon's long-term goals.
These were (i) governance, and (ii) HIV/AIDS. These issues cross-cut the pillars of the CAS, as they
have major implications for macroeconomic stability, poverty reduction, and private sector development.
The 1998 CAS Progress Report brought forward the governance issue, and the concern about HIV/AIDS
was introduced in the 2000 CAS Progress Report.
47.
Governance. Although it was implied by the objective of improving public resource
management, governance was not explicitly identified as an issue in the 1996 CAS. However, the 1998
CAS Progress Report presented an extensive discussion of the governance issue in Cameroon. This
followed a public recognition of the problem by the Government, partly precipitated by its classification
by Transparency International as the most corrupt country in the world. Government understanding of the
links between its governance problems and the reluctance of the international community to invest in
Cameroon had matured since 1996, partly as a result of IDA policy dialogue. The 2000 CAS Update
planned for a Governance Overview to assist the Government in the preparation of a Governance and
Anti-Corruption Strategy for the PRSP. This review was carried out, and an operation to support
Government actions in this area is planned for the next CAS.

11

A component to support judicial reforms was included in the Privatization TA Project, but could not be implemented.

Annex 3 - CAS Completion Report

48.
HIV/AIDS. An extraordinary effort was made by the Bank team during the period following the
1998 CAS Progress Report to get the Government of Cameroon to recognize the potential magnitude of
the HIV/AIDS threat and to undertake preventive action before the epidemic reached crisis proportions.
Like poverty, HIV/AIDS was a problem that proved difficult for the Government to acknowledge and
address. A national strategy and program were supposedly in place, but little progress had been achieved
on the ground. The Bank made a point of raising the issue in high level policy dialogue, retrofitting its
ongoing operations to improve the focus on HIV/AIDS, and including HIV/AIDS components in projects
under preparation. A consultant to the Agricultural Extension Project, which had piloted the
incorporation of HIV/AIDS concerns, was assigned to assist the Government in implementing its
program. However, there was a fundamental difference between the Bank’s view of HIV/AIDS as a
threat to a country’s development prospects, and the Government’s view of it as primarily a health
problem. Consequently, by 1990 little had been accomplished relative to the Bank’s ambitious agenda for
HIV/AIDS. Subsequently, however, with support through the Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project (FYOl),
the quality of the dialogue has improved and the Government of Cameroon has begun to take action on
HIV/AIDS .
49.
Summary Assessment. A majority of the CAS’S planned outcomes were achieved, including
those most relevant to the country’s own goals. As a result, Cameroon has returned to a growth path and
has become eligible for international debt relief, an important prerequisite for shifting the focus of public
expenditures to poverty reduction. Despite a failure to achieve many actions believed to be essential for
poverty reduction, in fact, income poverty, which had increased substantially due to the economic crisis,
returned to pre-depression levels over the CAS period. This suggests that macroeconomic adjustment
complemented by improved performance in key sectors such as finance and infrastructure can help a
country overcome the poverty-inducing consequences of a severe depression. However, such actions are
not likely to be sufficient to address persistent structural poverty problems. These remain to be addressed
in a second generation program which will likely take another ten years to implement.
50.
The pillar of improvedpublic resource management has been substantially achieved in terms of
the original CAS objectives of enhancing revenue, controlling inflation, managing debt, and controlling
public expenditure. Settlement of domestic debt arrears is still ongoing. Budgetary reallocation in favor
of priority sectors and regions became meaningless when it proved impossible to verify actual
expenditures. Civil service reforms were planned and programmed but rarely implemented. Public
expenditure management received a good deal of attention during the CAS period, as it was closely
related to governance issues; many reports were prepared and discussed, but performance in this area,
though part of the structural adjustment agenda, has not yet substantially improved. l 2 The rehabilitation of
Cameroon’s public finances was further slowed by the Asian financial crisis, by declining output from its
domestic oilfields, and by the reluctance of donors other than the Bank to come forward with new
investment. In retrospect, the strategy of support for Cameroon’s structural adjustment program worked
where the Government was firmly committed to implementing the program, but failed where the
Government did not really want to change.

51.
On the poverty reduction pillar, the challenge to the World Bank Team was to convince the
Government that poverty should be addressed along with, rather than after, restoring economic growth.
Needed actions were identified in the CAS, but these did not correspond to Government priorities, and
consequently little was achieved in terms of measurable change in outcome indicators. Instead, the CAS
period was largely spent in conducting intensive policy dialogue and involving stakeholders to convince
the Government of the need for fundamental change. The one attempt to bring about change through
12

Improved performance in public expenditure and resource management is expected to materialize with the introduction
of the integrated information and financial management system of government revenue and expenditure, implementation of
which started in late 2001 (as a prior action for the second PRGF review), and is to be completed by end-September 2003.

Annex 3 - CAS Completion Report

-12-

investment lending in advance of Government commitment proved a failure (the Health, Population and
Nutrition Project). Wisely, other planned projects in Education and Social Development were postponed
or dropped.
52.
The Agricultural Research and Extension Project did go forward, aimed at achieving institutional
and cultural change, and including a pilot program in community-based development. This successful
pilot became the basis for preparing a national community-based development program which is expected
to go forward, with Bank support, during the next CAS period. In Education, a LIL was used to test the
Government’s willingness to experiment and learn from experience. While the LIL did not succeed in
getting Government to adopt needed management changes, it stimulated a dialogue which contributed
toward the preparation of the Government’s Education Sector Strategy for the PRSP. Clearly, the lending
strategy envisaged under the CAS to support poverty alleviation evolved in response to a recognition that
change in Cameroon would not come easily and would require a shared learning approach to be
sustainable.
53.
Exogenous factors affecting the achievement of poverty alleviation objectives during the CAS
period were mainly the same factors as those that slowed the pace of growth: the Asian financial crisis,
declining oil production, and the reluctance of donors and the private sector to re-engage in Cameroon.
The difference between the substantial achievement of growth objectives and the minimal progress
towards poverty alleviation objectives over the CAS period was mainly due to endogenous factors; first,
lack of information, then weak political commitment, and finally the lack of Government capacity to
deliver the needed services. Bank efforts during this period were aimed at, first, filling the information
gap, and second, raising consciousness, generating commitment, and bringing civil society into the
dialogue on poverty. Joint work with Government and civil society on poverty-oriented sector strategies
set the stage for directing future HIPC resources towards poverty alleviation. Shared learning experiences
were key to generating the necessary understanding and commitment, and may have done much to
reactivate latent capacity in Government as well.
54.
On private sector development, substantial progress was achieved in financial sector reform,
privatization of parastatals, and creation of regulatory capacity in the public sector. In infrastructure, a
priority road network was defined and new institutions put in place to plan and carry out road
maintenance in a sustainable manner. However, these changes failed to elicit a strong response from
investors, apparently due to concern over governance and corruption issues. Because of the limited
investment response, there was limited opportunity to ensure that growth would be employmentgenerating and pro-poor. Though privatization was successfully accomplished, it took longer than
expected, and the consequences for growth were not as impressive as they might have been. Social and
environmental constraints on private sector development were not fully anticipated by the Government,
and entered the Bank (and IFC) dialogue only at a late stage. The main issues impeding investment,
however, were those related to governance.

55.
Sustainability. The PRSP preparation process and the impending release of HIPC resources have
created a momentum for change that augurs well for the sustainability of the reforms achieved so far and
the chances of achieving “second generation” reforms in the near future. Nevertheless, there are still
significant risks associated with the magnitude of investments needed to achieve growth targets and the
management of social tensions, including threats to security. Continued economic growth and a visible
increase in the commitment of Government to resolve governance and poverty issues should help to
mitigate these risks in the coming years. Finally, the spread of HIV/AIDS remains a serious threat to the
country’s development prospects.

56.
Institutional Impact. The CAS agenda was largely one of policy reform, and this agenda has been
nearly completed. Institutional change has taken place at the top levels of Government. It is difficult to

Annex 3 - CAS Completion Report

-13-

assess at this point how far these changes have penetrated the culture of Government institutions and
changed the behavior of civil servants. Institutions serving the private sector have been significantly
transformed, and there is no possibility of going back on these reforms. Regional trade and regional
institutions have been successfully promoted. Good work has been started on developing publidprivate
partnerships for service provision. The Bank has played an important role in widening the space for
public participation in decision making and in mobilizing capacity in the private sector. However, the
Government has still not fully implemented civil service reforms, improved its performance in public
expenditure management, or addressed the judicial reform agenda.

C.

Bank Performance

57.
Portfolio performance, The 1996 CAS described the problems which had plagued the earlier
generation of IBRD-financed projects: absence of counterpart funds, failure to comply with audit
requirements, mismanagement of special accounts, and failure to observe Bank procurement procedure^.'^
However, it expressed confidence that the new portfolio of IDA-financed operations would operate under
substantially improved conditions, due to intensified supervision and closer monitoring by staff in the
Resident Mission, as well as by required hiring of financial managers and independent auditors by the
implementing agencies. In 1998, despite these measures, portfolio performance remained very weak. A
1997 CPPR produced action plans to improve disbursements under the two ongoing investment
operations, and responsibility for managing these projects was transferred to the Resident Mission.
Another CPPR and Portfolio Action Plan were scheduled for FY98.
58.
Through intensive efforts by the Bank, the quality of the portfolio improved significantly between
1998 and 2000. A procurement specialist was hired in the Country Office, and a financial specialist was
added in FY02. Six ongoing IDA operations and the GEF project were rated satisfactory in FYOO.
However, the Health, Fertility and Nutrition Project (FY95) continued to perform poorly until its closure
in FYO1. The portfolio has now increased to eleven active projects. A CPPR undertaken in December
2002 highlighted continuing problems: procurement and disbursement delays, inadequate implementation
capacity, and shortcomings in project supervision. Recently, the Country Office has taken on additional
responsibility for managing the quality of the portfolio.

59.
Despite the fact that all projects carry two “risk” flags for country risk and country
macroeconomic management, the number of potential problem projects has remained low, indicating that
project execution is generally satisfactory. Furthermore, there are different potential problem projects in
each year, indicating that identified problems are being solved on a case-by-case basis. There are no
longer significant problems with counterpart funding or project management, indicating that Government
is now more supportive of the Bank’s program. Eight projects have been subjected to a Quality of
Supervision Analysis by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG); six have been rated Satisfactory
and two Marginal.14 A Quality at Entry review of the Agricultural Extension and Research Support
project rated this project as Marginal, apparently for macro rather than project-related reasons (failure of
the Government to proceed on civil service reform more generally). Finally, a QAG review of the
Cameroon CPAR rated this piece of Fiduciary ESW as Satisfactory.
60.
Aid Coordination. At the beginning of the CAS period, the Bank was almost alone in providing
donor support to Cameroon. The country was seen as a reluctant reformer, and other donors waited to see
13

Furthermore, most of the projects approved from 1982 to 1994 had unsatisfactory outcomes, uncertain sustainability,
and modest to negligible institutional impact. Thus, they were not really good investments for the Government of Cameroon.
14

real evidence of its commitment to improved governance and poverty alleviation before re-engaging with
Cameroon in a significant way. Those donors who maintained a presence in the country accompanied the
PRSP process with interest. An awareness that the international community saw poverty alleviation as
the key justification for debt relief undoubtedly helped strengthen the Government’s commitment to the
process.
61.
The 1996 CAS expected the Bank to play a catalytic role in assisting the Government to obtain
the financing it needed to achieve its short-term objectives. A Consultative Group meeting was carried out
in FY97, under IDA leadership. However, aid flows continued to be low, and by 2000 donor coordination
was viewed as unsatisfactory because of inadequate leadership by Government. The PRSP process has
proved to be a good mechanism for involving other donors, together with Cameroon civil society, in
building a firm consensus on the programs to be supported under the PRSP with HIPC funds. UNDP has
been helpful on governance and poverty issues, and UNAIDS plays a key role in the Bank assistance
strategy on HIV/AIDS.
62.
Consultation and Coordination with Development Partners. The 1996 CAS was based primarily
on consultation with a few key leaders in Cameroon. The private sector agenda was quickly broadened to
include consultation with private sector groups in Cameroon and outside. However, public sector reforms
were often blocked by government officials who had not been involved in developing the CAS strategy.
Realization of this result led the Country Team to initiate more dialogue with sector decision makers.
Over the CAS period, this process was gradually broadened to include more civil servants and
representatives of civil society. The culmination of this process was the preparation of a PRSP in a truly
participatory manner.
63.
A client feedback survey conducted in 1999 showed a perceived disconnect between the Bank’s
rhetoric on poverty reduction and the priority given to poverty reduction in its program in Cameroon.
Respondents felt that the Bank relied too heavily on technical assistance and not enough on building local
capacity. They wished for more communication, sharing of Bank documents, and solicitation of
beneficiary input in the design as well as the implementation and evaluation of projects. The Country
Team interpreted these findings as reflecting a lack of communication. The Country Office has now
implemented a dynamic outreach strategy.

D.

Lessons Learned

64.
This assessment confirms the continuing validity of OED’s 2000 evaluation of the Cameroon
country assistance program. OED suggested that the future challenge for the Bank would be to assist
Cameroon to design and implement measures which would lead to an efficient use of the savings to be
generated through the HIPC process. Given the shrinking administrative budget and small prospective
lending program, the report urged the Bank to be selective in the next CAS, concentrating on a smaller
number of reforms that could be closely monitored and would be likely to produce tangible results.

The following lessons can be learned from implementation of the 1996 CAS:
e
e
b

e
e
e

A consistent and sustained country dialogue is needed to get results.
Adjustment lending needs to be followed up with investment operations to build capacity and
consolidate commitment to reforms.
Growth performance in Cameroon must be sustained through continuing support to private sector
development.
Future growth needs to be made more pro-poor through a focus on improving agriculture and
other income-generating activities, as well as improving service delivery to the poor.
Participation and a “learning approach” are key to building commitment and capacity both in
Government and in the private sector.
Governance issues must be addressed as an integral part of a comprehensive development
framework.

The experience of the 1996 CAS shows that reforms can be carried out even under the most
66.
difficult conditfons, but they will probably take longer than expected. Government may be the best judge
of the pace at which policy reform can be implemented without straining the social fabric of a country.
However, even extensive policy reform will not generate much economic growth if investor confidence is
not restored. Therefore, governance issues should receive a high priority in order to speed up the pace of
investment.
67.
Before policy reform can be achieved, Government must be convinced that a problem is serious
and must be committed to its solution. Policy reforms pushed through by a macroeconomic team can be
blocked at the sectoral level. Even with high level commitment in sector ministries, implementation may
be delayed if middle level civil servants have not developed ownership for the reforms and a client
orientation. Thus, institutional analysis, stakeholder analysis, and beneficiary participation are needed to
design and implement successful sector strategies. Given the reduced capacity of Government to provide
public services, there is a need to place greater reliance on the private sector and civil society to
complement Government initiatives.
68.
The adjustment agenda is now largely completed and with full HIPC resources in sight,
Cameroon no longer risks net negative transfers. Structural or sectoral adjustmenthnvestment operations
(SECALs, SILs or hybrids) could usefully combine remaining reforms with investment support focused
on capacity building. New approaches should be piloted through LILs or pilot components in ongoing
projects. “Scaling-up” successful programs should be based on extensive institutional and stakeholder
analysis and should be prepared and implemented in a participatory manner. Analytic work under the next
CAS should address issues which are important for poverty reduction but have been neglected so far,
including rural finance, natural resource management, and gender issues. It will be important to follow
through on civil service reforms through decentralization and shared decision-making. Finally, the
unfinished agenda for public expenditure management and judicial reform should be incorporated in
future work on governance.

AND DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

I.

Introduction

1.
The provision of assistance under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative would reduce substantially
Cameroon's external debt burden. Cameroon reached the Decision Point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative in October 2000. At end-June 1999, Cameroon's disbursed and outstanding debt amounted to
US$7,802 million in nominal terms. The net present value (NPV) of this debt, after assuming the full use
of traditional debt relief mechanisms' (US$4,691 million), was equivalent to 205 percent of exports. The
Enhanced HIPC assistance to be provided to Cameroon would amount to US$1,260 million in NPV
terms. As can be seen in Chart 1, this reduction would bring down the ratio to 150 percent at end-June
1999 and, under the assumptions made at the Decision Point2, the ratio would decline steadily during the
complete period of analysis (FY99/00 - FY 18/19). The delivery of bilateral assistance beyond HIPC3 at
the Completion Point would further reduce the ratio.

2.
The World Bank assistance under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative would amount to US$179
million in NPV terms. Following the Decision Point Document, this assistance was to be delivered
through: (i) the provision of IDA supplemental HIPC debt relief grants during the interim period4 to cover
45 percent of IBRD debt-service due (equivalent to US$60 million in NPV terms or one third of the total
assistance to be provided by the Bank), (ii) a supplemental HIPC debt relief credit from IDA of US$118
million at the Completion Point to repay outstanding IBRD debt; and (iii) a reduction of 51 percent in
IDA debt service falling due after completion point and through May 2009. The mechanisms described
above would have reduced the debt service payments by about US$266 million. However, since the
Stock of debt operation on Naples terms on official bilateral and commercial debt.
The main assumptions were the following: (i) a real GDP growth rate rising from 5 percent to 7 percent, with a low
inflation (2 percent); (ii) a growth of export volumes of 6.2 percent in average; (iii) an increase of the revenue to GDP ratio from
16 percent to 21 percent; and (iv) highly concessional new financing.
3
For the purpose of this exercise, this scenario was prepared based on preliminary estimates on the amount of the
bilateral assistance beyond HIPC. The final figures may change significantly in terms of the level of the assistance and the profile
of its delivery.

Other major multilateral creditors and the Paris Club are also providing interim assistance.

Completion Point would be reached after the date that was assumed at the Decision Point', the nominal
amount and the schedule of assistance to be provided by the Bank after the Completion Point will need to
be adjusted.

The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio under the CAS lending scenarios

(i) The evolution of the ratio until the end of the CAS period

3.
During the period July 1999 - June 2006, the NPV of debt-to exports ratio6 would remain
below 150 percent and would be broadly in line compared to the Decision Point projections. As at
end-June 2002 the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would have reached 137 percent, compared to 134
percent projected at the Decision Point (see Chart 2). Additionally, the results of the simulations for the
CAS baseline indicate that the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio at the end of the CAS period would reach 88
percent, three percentage points above the level projected at Decision Point7.

Cameroon's lower actuaVprojected exports performance compared to the Decision
Point projections. Actual exports for the period July 1999 - June 2002 have been lower
by about seven percent in average than projected at the Decision Point (see Table 1).
Also, for the rest of the period of analysis the updated exports projections are well below
the Decision Point projections (about 20 percent lower in average for the CAS period and
about 29 percent lower in average beyond the CAS period).
Lower levels of new borrowing compared to the Decision Point projections. Given
the lower exports, had the new borrowing been as high as in the Decision Point
Document, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would have been ten percentage points

At the Decision Point it was assumed that the Completion Point would be reached by March 2003. The current
expectation is that it would be reached by end-April 2004, once the one-year Progress Report on the PRSP is presented to the
Bank and Fund Boards. This delay is due to a slower than expected progress in the preparation of the PRSP and on the
implementation of other completion point triggers.
6
All the simulations presented in this CAS are updates of the Decision Point debt sustainability analysis. For the period
July 1999 - June 2002 the Decision Point figures were updated by the actual new borrowing and exports and beyond this period
by the corresponding figures (new borrowing and exports) under the different CAS scenarios. However, this simulations do not
take into account the evolution of exchange rates and discount rates. Given the sensitivity of the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio to
this factors, the results of the full DSA that will be conducted for the Completion Point may be significantly different.
Under the CAS high-case and the CAS low-case lending scenarios, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would reach 88 and 86
percent, respectively.

'

higher than projected at the Decision Point. However, actual disbursements for the period
July 1999 - June 2002 would have been about 39 percent lower than projected at the
Decision Point (Table l), and during the CAS period, they are expected to be about 27
percent lower. Consequently, by the end of the CAS period, the stock of total debt would
be about 18 percent lower than projected at the Decision Point.

(ii) The evolution of the ratio beyond the CAS period

5.
The results of the simulations suggest that under the three scenarios proposed in the CAS,
the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would remain below 150 percent during the complete period of
analysis (see Chart 3). Due to the material reduction in new borrowing figures under the CAS baseline,
at end June-20 19 the NPV of debt to exports ratio would reach 4 1 percent, 3 1 percentage point lower than
projected at the Decision Point. At the same date, the NPV of debt-to exports ratio under the CAS
highcase and lowcase scenarios would reach 44 and 39 percent, respectively.

projections

6.
Debt sustainability prospects for Cameroon seems robust under the CAS scenarios. Two
alternative scenarios have been prepared: i) lower exports growth starting in 2006/07 (3 percentage points
lower than projected under the CAS baseline), and ii) higher levels of new borrowing starting in 201020118. The impact of lower exports in the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would be an increase of 11
percentage points in average beyond the CAS period (see Chart 4). Similarly, the ratio would be raised by
about 5 percentage points if higher levels of new borrowing are assumed. However, in both casesg the
ratio would remain below 100 percent. As shown in Chart 4, similar results are obtained for the CAS high
case scenario.

Notwithstanding these results, Cameroon remains vulnerable to shocks beyond its control and,
to increased levels of new borrowing. For this reason, it will be important to monitor closely the evolution
of the external debt indicators and ensure that a prudent borrowing policy is maintained". This would
include the linkage of the Bank's assistance program during this CAS and beyond to debt sustainability
indicators, limiting the commitments consistently with the sustainability of the external debt.

8
Starting at this year, the PRSP new borrowing projections start to decline dramatically. In the alternative scenario, it is
assumed that new borrowing would follow the latest IMF projections.
9
An even considering the combined effect.
10
As shown in the simulations, the favorable evolution of the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is driven mainly by the new
borrowing projections, which have been significantly revised downwards compared to the Decision Point projections.
