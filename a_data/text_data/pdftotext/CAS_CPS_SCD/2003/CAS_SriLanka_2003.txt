Country Assistance Strategy
Executive Summary
i.
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka-discussed at the Board on June 13,
1996-was prepared at a time of great uncertainty with regard to the prospects for peace, political
stability and economic reform. For a number of years the uncertainties continued: Sri Lanka went
through frequent elections that slowed the momentum for structural reform and the domestic security
situation-most notably, an escalation of the nearly two decade-long civil conflict waged between the Sri
Lankan army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)-took a tremendous toll on development
of this unique island nation.
ii.
Since late-2001, however, the situation in Sri Lanka has shown noticeable improvements. On the
peace front, 'a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Government and LTTE in February
2002 has resulted in a permanent cease-fire. Five successful rounds of peace discussions-facilitated by
Norway-have taken place and with significant advances being made, there is great optimism that the
long-standing conflict can be resolved. On the political front, in December 2001, a private sector-oriented
Government-headed by Prime Minister Mr. Rani1 Wickremasinghe-assumed control and has moved
forward decisively in starting to implement a comprehensive reform program. Finally, on the economic
front, Sri Lanka has begun to experience a gradual recovery and the economy is currently growing at an
annual rate of more than 5 percent. With these developments, today Sri Lanka faces a rare window of
opportunity.
iii.

The Executive Directors may wish to discuss:
The planned significant increase in IDA activity in response to the peace process and poverty
reduction strategy (PRS);
The balance between the lending and non-lending programs;
The choice of instruments to deliver the lending program; and
The appropriateness of the CAS outcomes given the PRS.

iv.
The Government has articulated an economic program and poverty reduction strategy: Regaining
Sri Lanka: Vision and Strategy for Accelerated Development (RSL). This is an ambitious proposal to
eliminate factors which inhibit the restraints on private sector activity and to change the role of the state,
while addressing the key elements of poverty. The principal objectives of RSL include: (i) building a
supportive macroeconomic environment; (ii) reducing conflict-related poverty; (iii) creating opportunities
for pro-poor growth; (iv) investing in people; (v) empowering the poor and strengthening governance; and
(vi) implementing an effective monitoring and evaluation system.
V.
The CAS program supports the Poverty Reduction Strategy and is organized around three central
themes: Peace, Growth and Equity. First, a return to peace and restoration of domestic security are
critical to create a framework for sustainable poverty reduction and growth and ensure that the fiscal
burden remains tolerable. It is also important towards ensuring that the most vulnerable poor groupsi.e., the displaced and those in conflict-affected areas-are reached. Secondly, economic growth is the
main instrument for achieving prosperity and creating more resources for distribution. Finally, ensuring a
balance/equity within the society is essential, especially with deep pockets of poverty existing in the
South and North East. Sri Lanka's ability to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be
influenced by equitable progress towards improving social and human development indicators. The
assistance strategy is a comprehensive one in which the International Development Association (IDA),
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)

all play significant roles. Capacity building is an integral element of the strategy and the World Bank
Institute (WBI) plays a central role in implementing this cross-cutting theme.
vi.
The CAS is “results-focused,” In the thematic area of peace, key outcomes that the CAS is
designed to support include: (i) restored infrastructure in health, education and irrigation; and (ii)
technical capacity built to implement the reconstruction and poverty reduction efforts. In the area of
growth, key CAS outcomes include: (i) legal frameworks established to increase flexibility in the labor
and land markets; (ii) regulatory environment conducive to private sector participation established; (iii)
the time and formal cost of business start-up reduced; and (iv) agricultural producers receiving more
consistent price signals and clearer land title. Finally, in equity, key CAS outcomes include: (i) improved
access to and quality of public services in education, health and water supply; and (ii) expanded degree of
empowerment of communities to address their own development needs.
vii.
The base case lending program consists of an average of four operations per year for a total of
US$SOO million of IDA resources during FY03-FY06. In each year, the lending program would be
anchored in a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) providing program support to the
implementation of the PRS. This would be complemented by two to four investmentlsectoral operations
per year to support key programs in the focus areas. Given the intensity of the conflict, Sri Lanka
qualifies for a limited amount of IDA grants during FY03 and FY04. Key operations in the equity
theme-i.e., in rural water, health and rural poverty-would be financed by IDA grants. Lending
activities would be accompanied by a strong non-lending program, with a particular focus on public
expenditure and poverty issues. In the base case, it is assumed that progress would continue towards
achieving a lasting peace. To remain in the base case, specific triggers must be met including: (i)
maintaining satisfactory macroeconomic performance; (ii) successful implementation of the economic
reform program; (iii) progress in addressing equity concerns; and (iv) satisfactory portfolio management.

viii.
The high case scenario would have a lending volume approximately 25 percent above the base
case. In addition to maintaining performance as envisioned under the base case, additional improvements
would be expected in the areas of fiscal management, private participation in infrastructure, public sector
management and decentralization. The strategy also describes two types of low case scenarios: (i) a
situation triggered by a breakdown of the peace process and the resumption of hostilities or the serious
lagging behind of structural reforms; and (ii) a deeper low case scenario-i.e., an exit strategy-if the
peace process were to break down entirely and hostilities were to break out on a national scale.
A CAS Completion Report--evaluating performance under the previous CAS-has
been
ix.
prepared and the lessons learned have been subsequently incorporated. Furthermore, the CAS contains a
comprehensive country program results framework that links together the different levels of results-Le.,
the country’s longer-term development agenda (based on the PRS/RSL) and the shorter-term goals to be
achieved during the CAS period and supported by the Bank’s interventions. During initial
implementation of the CAS, special focus will be placed on refining the results framework by
establishing: (i) baseline information and benchmarks for the various indicators to be monitored during
implementation; and (ii) a solid monitoring and evaluation capacity.
X.
Because of the historic moment at which Sri Lanka finds itself, the strategy is inherently risky.
The Government and indeed the LTTE are themselves being very bold and taking enormous risks with
respect to their own political futures for the sake of a better future for the people of Sri Lanka. The Bank
should be prepared to accept the risks of this strategy so long as the two parties remain committed to
achieving peace and laying the foundation for a renewed attack on poverty. Therefore, while the strategy
has very high risks, it has potentially very high rewards in a country that for too long has been performing
below its potential. The Bank is adopting appropriate strategies to mitigate the risks.

... - 111
xi.
Sri Lanka now has the opportunity to break out of the conflict and follow a path of sustained
development and progress for all its people. This CAS presents a coherent strategy for how the World
Bank Group should support Sri Lanka to help this opportunity be realized.

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

INTRODUCTION
1.
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka was considered by the Board on June
13, 1996 and a Progress Report was discussed on January 19, 1999. Since that time, Sri Lanka has been
through numerous elections that slowed the momentum for structural reform. At the same time, the
domestic security situation worsened as a result of the intensification of the nearly two decade-long civil
conflict between the Sri Lankan army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). This period of
uncertainty has been costly to the development of this unique island nation.
2.
In the last year, however, the country has experienced encouraging developments in many
respects. First and foremost, there has been progress towards peace and improved domestic security. The
Government and LTTE signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on February 23, 2002 that
resulted in a permanent cease-fire. Both sides have demonstrated their commitment to finding a lasting
solution to the conflict and five successful rounds of negotiations-facilitated by Norway-have taken
place. Second, a more optimistic political environment has emerged. The private sector-oriented
Government-headed by Prime Minister Mr. Rani1 Wickremasinghe-which took office in December
2001 has taken earnest and decisive steps in implementing a far-reaching economic reform program.
Finally, an economy recovery is underway with growth currently at an annual rate of more than 5 percent.
Today, Sri Lanka is poised to capitalize on these promising developments.

3.
This CAS has been drawn up on the basis of the post-conflict situation in which Sri Lanka finds
itself. As such, the lessons from other post-conflict situations have been incorporated, but it has been
decided not to apply the IDA post-conflict framework to this case. Although many features of postconflict countries apply to Sri Lanka, the state did not break down during this conflict, even within the
conflict-affected areas of the country. Therefore, a number of the challenges that other post-conflict
countries have faced are not present.

SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

Social Context

Sri Lanka-long an outlier among developing nations-holds a unique position in South Asia. It
was one of the first developing countries to provide universal health and education coverage and promote
gender equality and social mobilization. As a result, Sri Lanka achieved human development outcomes
comparable to those of high income countries and surpassed some of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) at an early stage of its development process (see Box 1 and Appendix VI). Sri Lanka has largely
eradicated destitution and its long-standing commitment to human development has ensured that even the
poor have relatively good health and education. For the most part, economic growth has been reasonable,
and despite the acceleration of the conflict in the 1990s, the country’s per capita income (US$830)
remains the second highest in South Asia (behind Maldives).

2003 and staff estimates.

A poverty assessment-Cri Lanku: Poverty Assessment'-was finalized in FY02. Based on is
and other analysis, it is estimated that 25 percent of Sri Lankans remain below the national poverty line;
there are large disparities in poverty incidence among regions; and the rural population remains especially
vulnerable to income fluctuations2. Whereas the Western province--containing the capital city and most
of the country's manufacturing and services-has a relatively low incidence of poverty, the North, East
and other areas affected by the conflict have high levels of material deprivation and human suffering.
While it has not been possible to carry out surveys in the North and East in recent years due to the
conflict, it is likely that the poverty conditions in these regions are far more severe than in other parts of
the country and compounded by massive destruction of economic and social infrastructure.

Over 90 percent of Sri Lanka's identified poor live in rural areas of the South and on tedrubber
estates in the Central region where the depth and severity of poverty are almost twice as high as in urban
areas. Small-scale subsistence agriculture-especially paddy farming-and wage labor (in farms or
plantations) are the main sources of income for most of the poor. Incidence of poverty varies only
slightly across ethnic groups, although plantation estate workers (who represent about 4 percent of the
poor and are mostly Indian Tamils) are among the poorest, often deprived of basic infrastructure and

other public services, and face severe difficulty integrating into the economy and society due to the
remote location of estates, language barriers, and for some, lack of citizenship cards.
7.
The poor in Sri Lanka are relatively well-protected due to free and universal access to health and
education services, large income transfer programs-such as Samurdhi-and substantial subsidy
schemes. The early successes in human development outcomes undoubtedly result from these longstanding policies. But there are weaknesses. While access to health and education services is welldistributed, quality--especially in poor areas-remains inadequate. Poor households also face shortfalls
in access to other basic services+.g., among the poorest households, only 38 percent have electricity, 55
percent safe sanitation and 61 percent safe drinking water. Access to English language and technical
education-both in great demand-is also low in poor regions. Moreover, social protection programs
have become highly politicized and Samurdhi is presently available to 60 percent of the population.
B.

Political Developments

8.
Sri Lanka has had numerous elections since the last CAS-including Provincial Councils (April
1999), Presidential (December 1999), Parliamentary (October 2000 and December 2001) and local
(March 2002). The United National Front (UNF)-traditionally
supportive of economic liberalizationwon a near majority in the 225-member legislature in the December 2001 parliamentary elections. With
the support of allied parties, the UNF formed a Government with a two seat majority, returning to power
after seven years in the opposition. Mr. Rani1 Wickremasinghe-Prime Minister from 1993-1994 and a
cabinet minister from 1977-1993-was sworn in as Prime Minister on December 9, 2001. Following this,
in the March 2002 local elections the UNF won a sizeable majority of the seats, strengthening its mandate
to pursue a peace and economic reform agenda.

9.
Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunge, leader of the People’s Alliance (PA), first became President in
1994. After being re-elected in 1999, her term expires in December 2005. Under the constitution, the
President is Chief Executive, while Parliament retains financial and legislative control. The party that
controls the legislature nominates the Cabinet of Ministers. Except for a brief interlude in 1994, this is
the first time in Sri Lankan history there is a President from one party and a legislature controlled by
another. Both sides are pursuing a strategy of “cohabitation”, with the Prime Minister making key policy
recommendations to Cabinet, which is chaired by the President. However, the President retains the power
to dismiss the Government after one year in office.
10.
A top priority of the new administration is
to end the nearly two decade-old civil conflict that
has placed severe stress on Sri Lanka (see Box 2)3.
Early on in his administration, the Prime Minister
revived internationally-supported initiatives to
undertake peace talks with the LTTE. The
Government and the LTTE announced a cessation
of hostilities in December 2001 and signed a
permanent cease-fire in February 2002 under a
Norwegian-brokered
Memorandum
of
Understanding (MOU). To date, this is the longest
cease-fire to hold. The Government has removed
the economic embargo imposed on rebel-held
areas, lifted restrictions on the movement of
civilians, rescinded restrictions on fishing and

Box 2: The Humanitarian Effects of the Conflict
The conflict in Sri Lanka has led to loss of life, the
displacement of persons belonging to all ethnic groups and
the destruction of infrastructure, health care facilities and
schools. Approximately 2.5 million persons lived in areas
of direct military activity-65,000 people have been killed,
800,000 are intemally displaced, including 172,000 living in
refugee camps and another 700,000 left the country. There
are 30,000 war widows and an estimated 300,000 displaced
children in the North East where the school drop out rate is
double the national average. The infant mortality rate in the
North East is twice the national average, the matemal
mortality rate is thrice the national average and 92% of
malaria deaths are reported from the region. There are an
estimated 1.8 million landmines in the North-a per capita
incidence comparable to Angola.

For a brief analysis of the root causes of the conflict, see Appendix I.

accelerated its de-mining program. The military has vacated schools and public buildings in the North
East and most paramilitary groups have been disarmed. The LTTE has re-opened roads in areas under its
control for vehicular traffic after a gap of 12 years. It has also opened political offices in militarycontrolled areas in an effort to participate in the political process and has expressed willingness to give up
its demand for a separate state under certain conditions. An international team monitors the truce and
approximately 260,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) have spontaneously returned to their original
homes since the cease-fire, with more returning daily.
11.
The Government de-proscribed the LTTE in September 2002 and Norwegian-facilitated peace
discussions commenced in Thailand on September 16, 2002. Further discussions were held in October
2002, December 2002, January 2003 and February 2003. Both sides have agreed to set up mechanisms to
oversee humanitarian and reconstruction activities in the North East-lead by the Sub-committee on
Immediate Relief and Humanitarian Needs (SIRHN)-and on the broad outlines of a future federal
structure of governance for Sri Lanka. Following the January 2003 discussions, the Bank was invited to
act as administrator for the North East Reconstruction Fund (NEW) through which humanitarian and
rehabilitation programs will be implemented (see paragraph 40) in the conflict-affected areas.

C.

Macroeconomic Performance

12.
Despite the prolonged civil conflict and several external shocks, Sri Lanka has sustained
reasonable economic growth of around 5 percent from 1996-2000 (see Table 1). Inflation generally
declined over this period and through 1998 the current account deficit declined significantly in line with
strong growth in exports and remittances. This, combined with labor migration (mainly to the Middle
East and accounting for over 12 percent of the labor force by 2000) reduced unemployment to 7.6 percent
from rates exceeding 14 percent in the early-1990s.

Sri Lanka has many strengths, including leading developing countries in recognizing the
importance of education, health and gender equality for development. These, together with one of the
most open trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) regimes in South Asia, have fostered healthy
manufacturing production and export performance, especially in tea and textiles. With the successful
privatization of the plantation sector, Sri Lanka has recaptured its position as the world’s largest tea
exporter. Benefiting from the liberalization of banking and telecommunications and, until 2001, the
expansion of tourism and container traffic, the service sector has grown steadily. Nevertheless, slow
progress in key structural areas-including civil service reform, restructuring state-owned enterprises
(SOEs), and financial, land and labor market reform-have undermined potential growth and slowed
progress towards reducing poverty.
14.
The fiscal situation was an increasing concern throughout the 1990s, with the deficit (before
grants) remaining between 7-11 percent of GDP and revenue performance weakening by about 4
percentage points of GDP since 1995. The escalation of the conflict in the late-1990s and the continuing
expansion of public sector employment compromised expenditure adjustments. Heavy reliance on
domestic deficit financing-averaging 75 percent of financing needs since 1996-have made interest
payments one of the largest budget expenditure items, amounting to 6.7 percent of GDP and over 40
percent of tax revenue in 2001. Hence, important expenditure categories-such as physical and social
infrastructure-have been crowded out and public debt climbed to over 100 percent of GDP in 2001.
15.
Sri Lanka suffered significant economic setbacks in 2001. The change to a floating exchange rate
regime on January 23 was an important step to stem the loss of external reserves that had started in 2000.
However, given import demand pressures and high oil prices, by March 31 gross official reserves fell to
under 2 months of import financing needs. To improve fiscal balances, stabilize the exchange rate and
reverse reserve losses, the Government entered into a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on April 204. However, adverse political and economic
developments in the second half of 2001-including the July 24’h attack by the LTTE on the Colombo
international airport, sluggish external demand, the prolonged drought and the general political
uncertainty-contributed to derailing the program5. With these shocks, output declined by 1.4 percent in
2001-the first contraction since independence in 1948. In addition, defense spending over-runs and
fiscal laxity intensified in the run up to the December 2001 elections.

In 2002, Sri Lanka began to experience a gradual recovery. The Government presented a strong
16.
budget in March demonstrating their commitment to growth, fiscal consolidation and structural reform.
To this end, the goods and services tax (GST) and national security levy (NSL) were transformed into a
value added tax (VAT), selective expenditure cuts were introduced (including a credible public sector
hiring freeze), restrictions on FDI were further relaxed and the deficit target was set at 8.5 percent of
GDP6. The measures have fostered investor confidence, boosted the stock market and doubled capital
inflows on a cumulative basis. With the return of normal rains and the cessation of hostilities, GDP
growth turned positive in the first quarter of 2002 and is estimated at about 3 percent for the year, largely
reflecting a pick-up in domestic-oriented activity since global demand remains sluggish. The 2003
budget presented on November 6, 2002 maintains continuity of the earlier initiatives.

For more information on the IMF program in Sri Lanka, see the “Fund Relations Note” in Appendix 11.

The program was subsequently brought back on track and the IMF released the last tranche under the SBA in
September 2002.

6

The estimated 2002 budget deficit of 9 percent is primarily due to less than expected GDP growth and VAT
exemptions intended to contain upward pressures on the cost of living.

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Prospects

D.

17.
Looking ahead, Sri Lanka has a good opportunity to restore macroeconomic stability and achieve
economic performance commensurate with its human and natural resources. Its medium-term prospects
for increased GDP growth and sustained fiscal and external sustainability have recently improved due to:
(i) the positive developments in the peace process; and (ii) the continued implementation of a credible
program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms. A growth-focused program is being
implemented to liberalize factor markets, increase agriculture productivity, restructure SOEs, strengthen
the commercial legal foundations, implement a stable import tariff regime and increase private sector
participation in infrastructure. Furthermore, steps are being taken to strengthen tax administration and
fiscal discipline, as well as to refocus the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to its primary task of price
stability. A healthy economic revival should result from these developments, along with improving
investor sentiments, expected reconstruction activities in the North East, improvements in the power
supply and recovery in agriculture and services.
18.
If peace holds and the stabilizatiodstructural reform program stays on track, Sri Lanka can
achieve 5-7 percent GDP growth with single-digit inflation in the medium-term (see Table 2)'. Regarding
the fiscal outlook, sustained implementation of the reform program, together with higher GDP growth,
should lead to gradual reduction of the budget deficit and public debt. This would also create increasingly
more fiscal space for high priority poverty programs. In an environment of price and political stability,
business and household formal savings would be encouraged; hence, leading to an increase in the national
savings rate.

REGAINING SRI LANKA AND CONNECTING TO GROWTH:
SRI LANKA’S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

Background

A.

19.
During the past four years, the administration has engaged in broad stakeholder consultations to
reach consensus on a medium- to long-term strategy for faster and sustained economic development and
poverty reduction. The incidence and depth of poverty were widely discussed, along with the country’s
approach to the problem. The island-wide consultative process also mobilized views of key stakeholders
on how to work together on relief and rehabilitation in the conflict-affected areas through the Framework
for RelieJ Rehabilitation, and Reconciliation (RRR). The results of these consensus-building
consultations together with background assessments resulted in a well-developed draft of Sri Lanka’s
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), which development partners strongly endorsed at the June 2002
Development Forum.
20.
After its election, the new Government set about the task of defining its own economic and
poverty reduction program-Regaining Sri Lanka: Vision and Strategy for Accelerated Development
(RSL)-more precisely’. This is an aggressive proposal to eliminate factors which inhibit the restraints
on private sector activity and change the role of the state, while addressing the key elements of poverty.
The main objective of the PRS is to “regain Sri Lanka” by accelerating growth and eliminating poverty
through private sector-led development. This marks a fundamental departure from the previous
unsustainable policies of “redistribution and transfer’’ to alleviate poverty. To meet its objectives, the
PRS outlines six core areas:

0

Building a supportive macroeconomic environment;
Reducing conflict-related poverty;
Creating opportunities for pro-poor growth;
Investing in people;
Empowering the poor and strengthening governance; and
Implementing an effective monitoring and evaluation system.

21.
The PRS identifies halving the number of poor by 2015 as its key target. Other targets include:
(i) raising GDP growth to around 7 percent within three to four years and to 10 percent in the second half
of the decade; and (ii) creating a minimum of two million new jobs during the next few years. For each
of the key PRS elements, recently implemented actionsheforms are identified and specific actions to be
implemented over the medium-term are outlined and prioritized (see Annex B 10).

B.

Building a Supportive Macroeconomic Environment

22.
Creating the conditions for accelerating economic growth with macroeconomic stability is a top
priority of the PRS. Sri Lanka has not been able to achieve economic growth consistent with its human
and natural resource endowments. In part, this below potential performance has been due to the conflict,
however, there is also a need to remove distortions in the economy and reform the enabling environment
to foster private sector development. The PRS identifies highly inflexible labor laws, constraints on land
transfers and sizes, inadequate infrastructure, a largehnefficient SOE sector, bureaucracy and a serious
bottleneck in tertiary education as key factors contributing to a high cost of doing business. Further, it
proposes to address a variety of legal, institutional and regulatory impediments which hamper private
sector activity.

23.
Recognizing that macroeconomic stability is a sine qua non for sustained high economic growth,
strong emphasis has also been placed on fiscal sustainability and strengthening the macroeconomic
framework. Significant reductions in the budget deficit and public debt are planned to restore fiscal
sustainability and strengthen macroeconomic stability. Currently, interest payments, the salary/wage bill,
defense spending and subsidies/transfers account for most of the budgetary expenditures, leaving small
amounts for capital expenditures-less than 5 percent of GDP-and negligible amounts for non-wage
repairshnaintenance. The medium-term objective is to reduce the budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP by
2005 and public debt to below 90 percent of GDP. Aside from the fiscal measures, some of the structural
reforms initiated under the program-Le., those pertaining to SOEs and administered prices-will
contribute to the fiscal consolidation and deficivdebt reduction effort. To ensure that fiscal discipline is
maintained and fiscal consolidation continues, the Government recently enacted the Fiscal Management
Responsibility Act, which requires regular reporting on the budget and also mandates a “Pre-election
Budgetary Position’’ report to discourage pre-election hand-outs. The Act also sets strict limits on
borrowing from the Central Bank and fixes the 2006 budget deficit target at below 5 percent of GDP.

structure; (ii) modernize the legalhegulatory environment for market entry and exit; (iii) establish a
modem, unified tax administration; and (iv) reduce and rationalize tariff protection.
26.
Sri Lanka has a significant number of large SOEs involved in commercial activities, including
utilities, transport, banking, petroleum and the wholesale of basic commodities. The PRS concludes that
these SOEs have been a drag on the economy and burden on the budget”, and have failed to deliver
reliable and affordable goods and services. Consequently, the PRS proposes to continue the privatization
program in most commercial activities, while undertaking restructuring of some of the large SOEs and
encouraging private sector participation in infrastructure. For example, in petroleum some of the Ceylon
Petroleum Corporation’s (CPC) assets are being divested and steps are being taken to open importation,
distribution and retail activities to the private sector. In power, legislation is proposed to: (i) unbundle
generation, transmission and distribution; (ii) break-up Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB); and (iii) establish
an independent regulatory body with responsibility for implementing economically sound tariff policy,
regulating the sector and issuing licenses.
27.
About 80 percent of Sri Lanka’s population and 90 percent of the country’s poor live in rural
areas. Despite its declining contribution to GDP (20 percent in 2000), the agricultural sector (including
livestock and fisheries) remains vital for employment and income generation. Thus, fostering rapid rural
development-particularly raising productivity and competitiveness in agriculture and the non-farm rural
sector-is critical for achieving faster overall economic growth and poverty reduction. As such, the PRS
gives high priority to rural development and measures are being taken to remove policy/institutional
constraints, including the on-going reforms in labor and land administration and policy. Other key
elements of the rural development strategy include: (i) rationalizing the trade regime for agricultural
outputs, inputs and technology; (ii) gradually reducing state involvement in agricultural marketing; and
(iii) supporting improvements in rural infrastructure-Le., roads, electricity, communications and water
and sanitation-to facilitate connectivity and integration.

C.

Reducing Conflict-Reluted Poverty

28.
As indicated, Sri Lanka’s protracted
conflict has resulted in a significant
humanitarian problem. Establishing lasting
peace is viewed as the key to reducing
conflict-related poverty and as such, a
critical element of Sri Lanka’s PRS. To this
end, the Government is pursuing a threepronged approach consisting of: (i)
negotiating a political settlement; (ii)
enacting constitutional reforms to fulfill the
aspirations of all citizens; and (iii)
expediting development in the conflictaffected areas (see Box 4). The RRR
Framework will help to address the basic
needs of the people affected by the conflict,
improve conditions for the resumption of
economic activities and facilitate ethnic
reconciliation. The Government has been
actively engaged with donors to mobilize
10

Box 4: The Bank’s Activities in the North East
Since 1999, the Bank has been a leader in assisting development of
to the North East (NE). The NE Irrigated Agriculture Project
(NEIAP; 1999) has been active in conflict-affected areas supporting
community-driven efforts to rebuild economic activity and the 2001
Land Mine Action Project (a US$1 million Post Conflict Fund
Grant administered by UNDP) has been supporting de-mining
activities. In mid-2002, the Bank developed a three-phase strategy
for comprehensive reconstruction support to the NE. In the first
phase, we are redirecting, expediting, and scaling-up activities in
the NE in those projects which focus on the entire country, but
activities could not be carried out in the NE because of the conflict.
Approximately US$15 million was identified through four projects.
In the second phase, certain projects-with significant savings
and/or where project components will not meet development
objectives by closing-have been restructured to provide additional
urgently needed support to the reconstruction efforts. US$3 1
million was identified in three operations and a restructuring
package was approved by the Board on November 14, 2002. In the
third phase, a longer-term program to meet the development needs
of the NE is being addressed in the context of this CAS. In
addition, the Bank will administer the North East Reconstruction
Fund (NERF)-the main vehicle for implementing humanitarian
and rehabilitation programs in the NE.

SOE losses equaled 1.5 percent of GDP in 2000 and budgetary (recurrent and capital) transfers to SOEs amounted to 3
percent of GDP in 2001.

financial support for immediate humanitarian and rehabilitation needs in the North East. A donor
conference was held in Oslo on November 25, 2002 and will be followed by an international donor
meeting in Tokyo on June 9-10,2003.

D.

Creating Opportunitiesfor Pro-Poor Growth

29.
Another priority of the PRS is to effectively connect poor regions to rapidly growing domestic
and international markets. The strategy focuses on six main pro-poor transport and communications
initiatives, specifically: (i) upgrading the port network; (ii) building a national highway system and
integrated road network; (iii) enhancing performance of the bus system; (iv) modernizing the railways; (v)
improving access to telecommunications facilities; and (vi) bringing internet into the countryside. The
strategy in this area is to introduce public-private partnerships to expand the scope for investment and
provide a wider range of services-especially in areas such as energy, ports, water supply and transportto the public.

E.

Investing in People

30.
Improving access to quality education and basic health services is central to the PRS and the
strategy promotes a growing private sector role in their provision. In education, the focus will be on: (i)
addressing regional inequities in the provision of quality basic education; (ii) improving the curricula in
secondary education; and (iii) enhancing the relevance of tertiary education in line with market needs,
including increasing capacity by opening up to the private sector. In healthhutrition, the goals are to: (i)
improve the nutritional status of infants, children and pregnant women; (ii) maintain a low incidence of
non-communicable diseases; (iii) reduce the burden of vector-borne diseases, including malaria; and (iv)
fight AIDS. The overall objective is to improve the equity, efficiency and effectiveness of health
expenditures and the main focus will be on preventive health care programs and encouraging the private
sector to develop secondary and tertiary care private hospitals. Capitalizing on Sri Lanka’s long-standing
strengths in social mobilization, there will be reliance on community-based organizations (CBOs) to
expand the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation services in rural areas under a sustainable
system of tariff setting and maintenance. In urban areas, the private sector will be encouraged to play an
increasing role in these activities.

F.

Empowering the Poor and Strengthening Governance

3 1.
Another thrust of the PRS is to change the role of the state from being a “provider” of goods and
services to being a “facilitator” of private sector activity. As such, there is commitment to reducing state
involvement in commercial activities and focus on primary activities and responsibilities in providing
public gooddservices and using public resources more effectively for poverty reduction. To this end,
there is a need to: (i) reform public administration; (ii) improve transparency and accountability; and (iii)
continue decentralization. As mentioned, public expenditure management needs to be strengthened,
including expenditure planninghudgeting, execution, monitoringhontrol and oversight. At the same
time, to empower the poor, the intention is to shift the focus of authority from the central to local
Governments. Efforts will be placed on strengthening the management capacities of local Governments
to ensure that they play a more effective role in meeting locally-defined initiatives and discharging
devolved responsibilities.

G.

Assessment of the PRS

32.
As indicated in the B a n W Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), Sri Lanka’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy is broadly appropriate for addressing the country’s current economic development and poverty
reduction challenges and provides a sound foundation for the Bank’s assistance. The PRS candidly lists

SRI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

Page I 1 of 31

the causes of poverty. Aside from the civil conflict, it correctly identifies the highly restrictive
controls/regulations that have inhibited the functioning of the domestic factor markets and rural economy
as principal causes of Sri Lanka’s below potential performance. It acknowledges that the heavy
involvement of the state in commercial activities has constrained private sector development and
economic growth. Particularly important is the recognition that the policy of redistributiodtransfers
pursued so far to reduce poverty has been ineffective. As mentioned, the PRS envisions a role for the
state as that of: (i) facilitator of an enabling environment for private sector-led growth; and (ii) creating
opportunities for the poor to participate in the growth process. The latter is to be achieved through greater
public expenditure devoted to human resource development and infrastructure. The PRS also calls for
smaller and better targeted safety net programs. Given the large public debt and the tight fiscal situation,
the PRS correctly indicates that the pace at which the reform agenda can be implemented depends on the
fiscal space that can be created by economic growth, the restoration of peace, macroeconomic stability
and concessional assistance.
This said, the JSA points out a number of areas in which the PRS could be strengthened;
33.
specifically:
There is nothing with regard to institutionalizing a public sector tracking system;
Although there is a comprehensive picture of the patterns and determinants of poverty, further
work is warranted to monitor and assess the impact of current and future fiscal policies on the poor;
The poverty diagnostics for the North East is inadequate and needs to be improved; and
0
There is a need to enhance institutional arrangements to coordinate monitoring and evaluation
and promote incentives for its use in policy and budgetary decision-making.
0

0

34.
These all underscore the tremendous capacity building needs in the country, especially as they
relate to measuring, analyzing, monitoring and evaluating poverty reduction outcomes. It is
recommended that the first annual progress report of the PRS include: (i) an update of the macroeconomic
framework and prioritization of policies aligned to a detailed costing of the PRS agenda; (ii) addressing
critical issues in the governance agenda, especially in civil service reform, transparency and
decentralization; (iii) a selection of indicators and baselines to monitor PRS implementation and setting
up an expenditure tracking system; (iv) a preliminary assessment of the impact of policies on the poor and
disadvantaged groups; and (v) completing the poverty assessment and reconstruction needs of the North
and East.

A.

THE BANK GROUP’S COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

The Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy for FY03-FY06

35.
The CAS program is built on the Poverty Reduction Strategy contained in Regaining Sri Lunku:
Vision and Strategy for Accelerated Development. Within this, the Bank will focus on three core themes:
Peace, Growth and Equity. Without peace, there is no prospect for development. This derives not only
from the difficulty of creating a framework for sustainable poverty reduction and growth in such a
situation, but also that the fiscal burden would likely become increasingly intolerable, and the most
vulnerable of the poor in today’s society-the conflict-affected and displaced populations-would not be
reached. Growth is the key to prosperity and to creating more resources for distribution. The Regaining
Sri Lanka strategy is the Government’s response to the poor recent growth performance, and answers one
of the Bank’s key concerns over the earlier drafts of the PRS. Equity concerns will remain high in Sri
Lanka, not only to permit the expected attainment of the MDGs, but more to ensure balance within the
society. Education and health have made great strides, but access varies sharply across the country and

quality is a major concern. Furthermore, the South faces many natural disadvantages and growth has
lagged behind other parts of the country. The explicit links between the PRS core areas and the CAS
priority outcomes by theme are contained in Table 3.

In designing the CAS program, wide consultations have been undertaken both within and outside
the Bank (see Appendix IV). The CAS is explicitly drawn on the fact that Sri Lanka is a post-conflict
country, and thus incorporates three key conclusions from the experience of such countries:

SRI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

Page 13 of 31

There is a strong case for increased assistance in the period following the end of hostilities,
although the maximum impact is likely to be felt two to four years after such a cessation;
There are good prospects for addressing key economic and social reforms in such a situation,
even those that have proven difficult in the past; and
The highest returns may be found in social aspects of development.
37.
The CAS has been drawn up as a Bank Group strategy with the full participation of IFC. As will
be seen below, there could be substantial synergies between the different arms of the Bank Group. In
addition, an important cross-cutting theme of the CAS is capacity building. First of all, for the conflictaffected areas to “catch up” with the rest of the country, strengthening capacity in the region is as
important as the physical reconstruction efforts. Furthermore, given the finalization of the PRS and
results-orientation of the CAS, there is a critical need to focus on building capacity both for successful
program implementation, as well as for effective monitoring and evaluation. While the World Bank
Institute (WBI) will play a leading role in these efforts, strengthening institutional capacity is an
important element in many IDA lending and non-lending activities.

Peace
38.
As mentioned, peace is the very basis for the future of the Sri Lankan economy and for balanced
poverty reduction. The key outcomes that the CAS is designed to support (see Table 3) include: (i)
restored infrastructure in health, education and irrigation; and (ii) technical capacity built to implement
the reconstruction and poverty reduction efforts.
39.
There is a huge need for reconstruction and capacity building and to address the fiscal support
needs generated by the peace process. It is important that the population begins to see the gains from
peace at an early stage and that resources are in place to permit resettlement to occur. The Bank has
already begun this process with the restructuring of the portfolio, which was approved by the Board on
November 14, 2002. This restructuring affected seven on-going projects and mobilized US$46 million in
extra resources for the North and East, some 17 percent of our undisbursed portfolio. In total
approximately US$62 million-or over 25 percent of the existing undisbursed portfolio-will be
available for this region of the country. The restructuring provides resources for health, water supply,
capacity building, connectivity, and payments to returning IDPs, in what is referred to as the North East
Emergency Reconstruction Program. This supplements the on-going work in community development
and irrigated agriculture (through NEIAP), education, the legal system and environment. Furthermore,
the Bank will contribute to the reconciliation effort in particular through the on-going education projects
by assisting the Government in its strategy to: (i) develop English as a way to eliminate language-based
segregation, while encouraging Sinhalese and Tamil as “second” languages-Le., native Sinhalese
speakers to learn Tamil and native Tamil speakers to learn Sinhalese; and (ii) formulate curricula,
textbooks and pedagogic approaches that foster pluralism, tolerance and social cohesion.
40.
In addition, the North and East have been starved of investment for the past 20 years. Poverty
levels are unknown, but appear to be among the highest in the country. After the immediate
reconstruction, there is 20 years of deferred maintenance and postponed investment that will need to be
addressed. It is likely that many development partners will be willing to participate in these efforts. The
Bank will work with these partners, both on the planned needs assessment in FY03”, and also in the
design and implementation of further support programs for infrastructure and for capacity building.
Many donors are willing to increase their assistance to Sri Lanka in the short-term to support

The Bank is leading the efforts in preparing the housing needs assessment and is working closely with UNICEF on
education, as well as co-financing the team leader with UNDP. The needs assessments will provide background for the
June 2003 Tokyo Financing Conference for Sri Lanka.

SRI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

reconstruction and rehabilitation. For this purpose, the North East Reconstruction Fund (NERF) has
been created and the Bank will act as its administrator. In the Bank’s lending program, a Credit for
Znfrastructure Rehabilitation and Capacity Building in the NE is proposed for early-FYO5, but its size
and timing would be determined to a significant degree by absorptive capacity issues and by the level and
timing of commitments from other development partners. This operation would be flexible, and thus able
to respond to a variety of needs in infrastructure, capacity and perhaps in land management, with the
Bank acting as the “lender of last resort”. A key feature would be to utilize such an operation to
encourage the local private sector, especially in the area of contracting.
An issue that has not yet been addressed is that of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
(DDR) of combatants. The two sides are not yet ready to discuss demobilization, and thus it is difficult to
assess whether it will be necessary for the Bank to consider a role in this regard. Initial discussions in
partnership with the International Labor Organization (LO) have taken place and this will be kept under
close review.
41.

Growth
At the core of RSLJPRS is the desire to raise the rate of growth and to rejuvenate the private
sector by removing the policy constraints that are inhibiting the achievement of these objectives. The
CAS strongly supports the Government’s view that it is imperative that the peace process be accompanied
by an equally determined economic reform process to unleash the strong potential of the economy. As
such, the key CAS outcomes (see Table 3) to be achieved include: (i) legal frameworks established to
increase flexibility in the labor and land markets; (ii) a regulatory environment conducive to private sector
participation established; (iii) the time and formal cost of business start-up reduced; and (iv) agricultural
producers receiving more consistent price signals and clearer land title.
42.

43.
A key component of any poverty reduction and growth scenario for Sri Lanka must be a sound
macroeconomic environment. As mentioned, the conflict has resulted in high fiscal deficits, leading to an
accumulation of over 100 percent of GDP in public debt and domestic debt of 58 percent of GDP.
Restoration of fiscal stability is at the center of the macroeconomic program to be supported by the IMF
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)-an
important basis for the Bank-supported program.
44.
In FY03, the Bank’s initial support to this process will come through the Economic Reform
Technical Assistance Project which was presented to the Board on December 10, 2002. This will
provide the technical support that is needed to implement the ambitious program. It is designed to be
flexible, in order to be able to respond to reform opportunities as they emerge. An initial group of reform
areas-including financial sector, utilities and regulatory capacity building-have been identified, but the
allocation of the majority of funds will be determined over the next three to four years and will likely
include assistance to prepare a public sector reform program. As mentioned below (see paragraph 65),
this project will also support capacity building efforts to strengthen the country’s poverty monitoring and
evaluation ability. This project accompanies the on-going Legal and Judicial Reform which is
supporting the modernization of the legal system, especially as it impacts on the private sector, and with a
special emphasis on improving the quality of judicial services. A particular focus is access to justice for
women and for the citizens of the North East through a Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant.
The completed PRS provides the basis to proceed with Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs) in Sri Lanka. Annual PRSCs would provide budgetary support to assist in the implementation
of the PRS, not least to permit government to provide public services in previously unserved areas. At
the heart of the PRS is a program to release the private sector from its constraints, and to reorient public
expenditure away from a welfare and control mentality towards an empowerment and service provision
approach. While the PRSCs would review the overall progress in the implementation of the PRS
45.

SRI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

Page 15 of 31

program, there would also be an annual focus on particular areas of the strategy where deeper progress
would be targeted. In the first of these-planned for FY03-the focus would be on factors of production:
finance, labor, land and utilities; the elements of the PRS described in paragraphs 24-26 above”.
46.
The financial sector has received a lot of past Bank attention, with an on-going operation to
support the strengthening of the Central Bank and a recently-completed Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP). Following up on vulnerabilities revealed in the FSAP with regard to anti-money
laundering and counter-terrorism financing, in the coming years the Bank will provide technical
assistance for capacity building and formulatiodimplementation of an appropriate legal framework.
Nevertheless, the primary obstacle to the healthy development of the financial sector remains the
dominance of the state banking system, whose reform would be central to this program. Labor markets
have long been identified as a major constraint to investment, and the program would focus on improving
certainty for employers in such areas as the costs and timing of redundancy, while improving the
functioning of the market itself through better information centers. Land markets are to be improved
through converting restricted land grants to freehold so that farmers can more readily sell, lease or use
their land as collateral. The reform of the power and telecommunications sectors calls for greater
regulatory capacity and a change in the role of the state, and this too would form a part of the early
program to be supported. Last and by no means least, the first year of implementation of the PRS would
see a strong emphasis of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for the PRS itself through various
capacity building efforts. In this regard, lack of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) has
made the costing of PRS initiatives difficult. The development of a MTEF-aided by public expenditure
analysis-which the Government plans to have in place by mid-2003, is key to a more in-depth costing of
the PRS, thereby helping to undertake pro-poor budget allocations over time, and the Bank will provide
any necessary support for this effort.
47.
The second PRSC would be in FY04 and might focus on two key areas for the poverty agendathe reform ofthe welfare system into one which is much more tightly focused on those in need, and
reform of the rural economy, in particular to raise the productivity of farmers, who remain the poorest
sector of the economy. The greatest challenge in this regard is to de-politicize and improve the targeting
of Samurdhi-largely a cash transfer program-based on the recently enacted Welfare Reform Act that
sets objective criteria for selection of beneficiaries through means-testing and tracking. These reforms are
expected to engender better targeting with lower exclusion of deserving beneficiaries. In the third
PRSC-in FYOS-attention would turn to the public sector itself, with a focus on the reform of public
sector employment systems and structures, and the related structure of public expenditure, including the
issues of decentralization of decision-making and revenue-sharing. It is likely that the implementation of
this public sector reform would need to be accompanied by a Technical Assistance Credit to support the
complex technical work associated with public sector restructuring (including retraining re-deployed
staff) and developing a comprehensive program for strengthening public sector capacity. If this reform
program is ready sooner it could be incorporated into the second PRSC. The specific theme of the fourth
PRSC in FY06 would be determined on the basis of the outcome of the Development Policy Review
(DPR), but could well focus on the management and efficiency of public expenditure.

48.
To accompany this work, a continuous program of Public Expenditure Review (PER) work is
planned, again with annual themes. Rather than producing a large report, this work would result in
12

Obviously, the reforms receiving “focus” in each of the PRSCs will not be completed in a single year, but will take
time for complete implementation-e.g., the land and labor reforms highlighted in the first PRSC. When a reform is a
“focus” area in one PRSC, it is likely that additional milestones to “cement” the reform will be featured in subsequent
PRSCs-Le., as discussed in paragraph 47, labor and land issues also figure prominently in reforming the rural
economy, and therefore, follow up actions in these areas will likely figure prominently in the second PRSC.

SUI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

Page 16 of 31

smaller outputs that can be incorporated into the living PRS as implementation proceed^'^. This would
complement and build on the work of the Country Financicrl Accountability Assessment (CFAA)and the
Country Procurement Assessment Review (OAR)-both to be completed in FY0314-and would form
the basis for a future program of technical support to reform the fiduciary framework. These would be
summarized in a Safeguards Assessment Paper that would also incorporate the current state of
knowledge on Sri Lanka’s management of environmental and social safeguards, and would accompany
the first PRSC to the Board.
49.
While addressing the policy issues through budgetary and technical support can remove many of
the constraints inhibiting the private sector, it is also important to contemplate the sources of growth.
This will be addressed in part by two proposed non-lending pieces. The first of these would be an
assessment of the Investment Climate carried out during 2003 and 2004 in cooperation with the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). In addition to the
standard work on the climate for “urban” investment, given the importance of encouraging off-farm
employment opportunities in rural areas, this would incorporate a “rural investment climate” component.
In addition, after the initial reform process has had a chance to eliminate the most obvious constraints, the
Bank would conduct a Development Polzky Review, with a particular focus on future sources of growth.
It is clear that the economy will be going through major changes in the corning years, both because of the
potential for new areas of growth and the likely decline of the garment industry after the end of the
current Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) in 2005. The PRS makes a start in this direction by outlining
detailed action plans for raising productivity in priority sectors-i.e., agriculture, fisheries, tourism,
apparel and the tea industry. However, the PRS does not analyze the links between these sectors and
poverty-related outcomes, which is critical for prioritizing policies that promote pro-poor growth. It is
also important to increase the availability of financing to support the growth of the private sector. IFC
will take the lead role here, making direct investments in medium and large-scale companies and building
the capacity of the financial sector to finance private enterprises-especially for small and medium
enterprises (SMEs)-through investments and technical assistance.

50.
One area that is considered by many to have significant potential for fostering growth both on its
own and by raising productivity in other sectors is the Znformation Communications Technology (ICT)
sector. This is an important focus of the Government’s development policy and the Bank would provide
support to this effort in FYO4-through E-Lanka-emphasizing the policy and regulatory environment,
the development of e-government, rural connectivity and societal applications. There seems to be great
potential for Sri Lanka to follow India as a major player in this market and this operation would be
designed to help “jump start” this activity. A related operation would be the proposed Improving
Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education Project (ZRQUE), which would both increase the
supply of in-demand skills-such as those in Information Technology (IT)-while also equipping recent
graduates with basic employment requirements, including English language skills. IFC will also consider
investments in ICT companies.
51.
Another issue that impacts on growth and also on the durability of the peace process and the
achievement of equality of opportunity is Land Administration and Policy. It will be important to absorb
the lessons of the Laming and Innovation Loan ( L a ) currently under implementation and decide
whether the experience justifies a “scaling up” into a major operation, that might include key aspects of
13

One particularly pressing issue to be covered by the PER work relates to the increased IDA lending volumes provided
through program support and Sri Lanka’s potential near-term graduation from IDA concessional lending (see paragraph
88 below). Specifically, given the already high levels of debt servicing, in the near future this work will focus on
helping Sri Lanka start to prepare-i.e., with regard to formulating a sustainable debt strategy-for the phasing out of
large volumes of concessional financing.

14

See Appendix V for a summary of the findings of these reports.

SRI LA NKA Country Assistance Strategy

land policy, not the least of which is the massive holdings of land by the Government in both urban and
rural areas. This analysis would be done in FY05, and if a positive evaluation of the learning experience
emerges, it could be followed by a scaled up project in FY06.
52.
Without rural growth, the prospects for sustained poverty reduction are unclear. However, while
land policy is a clear case, it is less clear how the Government proposes to address more general issues
related to agriculture and rural development. For instance, while the PRS advocates private sector-driven
productivity improvements, the action plan appears to advocate continued state interventions. The
strategy would also benefit from refinements to address important systemic issues such as improving
linkages between federal and provincial-level agencies and making lead institutions-such as the
Department of Agriculture-more responsive to sector demands. Policy issues would be addressed
through the PRSC framework, and the on-going Mahaweli project will continue to implement important
pilot programs in areas such as bulk water and river basin management. The Government has asked that
the Bank support the agricultural sector through lending. Based on recently completed work-Sri Lanka:
Promoting Agricultural and Rural Non-Farm Sector Growth, Report No. 25387-CE, February 2003-and
work contemplated for the future, should a reasonable proposal emerge, the program would be adjusted
accordingly. Nevertheless, while there is a land management problem in the wet zone, there is a water
management problem in the dry zone. If the pilots progress well and the on-going irrigation management
reforms are completed, this could be followed by lending support later in the CAS period.

53.
In the base case, IDA would not finance infrastructure. The two largest external providers of
financing-the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and ADB-are willing to continue to
finance the key programs in roads, energy and water supply. In the spirit of selectivity, IDA will
participate only with respect to supporting key reforms and potentially private participation in
infrastructure. If the Government does proceed with advanced reforms in areas such as urban water,
railways, roads financing and ports, and succeeds in attracting private participation, in a high case
scenario-in which these reforms are explicit triggers-IDA would consider participating through
lending and/or guarantees. While generally limited to supporting cases where private financing would be
attracted, one possible exception would be the highways sub-sector. Should the Government develop a
viable Road Fund, the Bank would investigate participating through a sector-wide operation. Support for
private infrastructure will be a top priority for IFC and is a primary area of potential synergy between
IDA, IFC and MIGA, with scope for a creative combination of the instruments available to the three
institutions if the policy environment is right. In the meantime, IFC will continue to look for investment
opportunities in this area, beyond its existing investments in power, ports and mobile
telecommunications.
Equity
54.
While Sri Lanka has made remarkable strides in the area of human development over the last
decades, serious equity issues remain-Le., equality of opportunity and access to services. Access to and
the quality of services in Sri Lanka differ greatly from one area to another. As such, equity issues are
very important in a country where the resource base is not evenly distributed and where groups of citizens
have been mired in poverty for a long time. Key CAS outcomes (see Table 3) focus on: (i) improved
access to and quality of public services in education, health and water supply; and (ii) increased degree of
empowerment of communities to address their own development needs.

55.
As noted, a new household income and expenditure survey (HIES) is under way, which will
include the North and East where many citizens suffer from conflict-related poverty. Once this new
information is available, the Bank will work with the authorities to draw up a poverty map of Sri Lanka
and collaboratively produce an Updated Poverty Assessment. This would start in FY04 and be finalized
in FY05. While many policy reforms have been outlined in the PRS, a mechanism to monitor and assess

SRI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

Page 18 of 31

their impact is largely lacking. It is difficult to judge a priori whether these reforms will reduce poverty
or have their intended impact. In this context, using the new national household data and other sources to
analyze the poverty and social impact of reforms, as well as building similar capacity within Sri Lanka,
remains a critical exercise for the future. This would be a focus of the Bank’s contribution to the joint
poverty work. Other early sector work would stress the MDGs and what is needed to attain these-and
beyond-in Sri Lanka.
56.
While the North and East suffer from conflict-related poverty, the South-notably Uva and
Southern Province-suffers from structural poverty. The resource endowment of these areas is limited,
water is scarce, distances are great and the human resource endowment is the lowest of those that are
known. Under the on-going Mahaweli project, the Government has carried out community-driven
development (CDD) pilots that have worked very well. NEIAP operates very successfully under similar
principles and there are numerous other examples of this type of approach in Sri Lanka. Thus, the
Ministry of Rural Economy has proposed that IDA undertake a Rural Poverty Reduction Initiative, under
which poor communities in the South would be mobilized to analyze their key constraints-Le., rural
roads, water supply, income-generating activities, etc.-and
resources provided directly to these
communities to address those constraints. This process is one that would be scaled up gradually and
would need support over a long period of time. An Adaptable Program Lending approach will be
utilized, under which IDA would commit support in phases for 10-12 years, and the scope of the coverage
would be gradually expanded from the South to include all the poorest parts of the country, including the
estate/plantation sector. The results of the rural investment climate study will be useful for this operation.
Nevertheless, one important service many rural communities place great emphasis on is water supply and
a Second Community Water project has recently been neg~tiated’~.It is envisaged that this operation
will make a transition into a CDD approach over its lifetime, developing the locally-based expertise to
support village level managed investments.
57.
One of the key questions facing Sri Lanka with respect to access to services is the growth of
urbanization and the related issue of Servicesfor the Urban Poor. It is one of the key issues within the
more general issue of decentralization, but with a set of rather specific features of its own. The
Government has begun working to address urban policy issues and obviously the eventual outcome of the
peace process-which will define more accurately the concept of “asymmetrical devolution”-will shape
future policy in this regard in key ways. In preparation for a possible lending operation in FY06, a
strategic options study, including fiscal decentralization issues, would be conducted in FY04. It is
possible that CDD approaches would be adapted to the urban framework for an operation in this area.
58.
In the sub-sectors related to equity concerns, it is very important that investment interventions be
based on sound analytical frameworks. A Health Sector Strategy and program formulation exercise is
under way, using a Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grant. This would lead to the first
proposed sector-wide operation for Sri Lanka in the Health Sector in FY04. This would supplement the
National HIV/AIDs Prevention operation that was approved on December 17, 2002 and aims to build
awareness of the risks of the pandemic, while improving capacity to address its most frequent
manifestation in Sri Lanka, in tuberculosis’6. The comprehensiveness of this sector-wide approach is
expected to deepen over time, and one key area that is not being addressed with the current health sector
15

Given the severity of the poverty in the South and the CDD approach to be used, as well as the emphasis placed on
water supply by rural communities, the Rural Poverty Reduction Initiative and the Second Community Water Project
will be entirely financed by IDA grants.

16

Although mention of HIV/AIDs is made with regard to the health context, it is well-recognized that this issue is more
appropriately an overall development issue. As such, an important aspect of the recently approved operation is to
strengthen multi-sectoral involvement-i.e., the Ministries of Health, Defense, Labor, Education, Child Protection and
Interior-and capacity on the fundamentals of HIV prevention.

SRI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

work is that of Nutrition. Joint analytical work would be carried out, for later incorporation to the health
sector program. Furthermore, IFC has already invested in a private hospital in Colombo and would
continue to look for opportunities to support the private provision of health services.
Similarly, it has been agreed with the Ministry of Education that there would be a Strategic
Framework Exercise for the Education Sector launched in 2004 and followed by a possible Education
Sector Operation in FY05. Under this and the health sector operation, the Bank would provide financial
support to the overall sector programs-essentially on a budgetary support basis-while ensuring
appropriate expenditure frameworks to address key sectoral issues and constraints, with procurement and
financial management arrangements that reassure all financiers-including most importantly the state-of
sound resource use. In both sectors, it is especially important to use this opportunity to create capacity in
the Ministries so that they can more strategically direct recourses in the future, as well as more effectively
monitor human resource development progress. Close work with the authorities would be undertaken to
develop concrete action plans in areas such as decentralizing school management, promoting publicprivate partnerships and seeking private investment in training and technical education. Effective
delivery of education services will also require defining the role of the provinces and devolved
institutions in school administration and teacher deployment, in the context of the overall decentralization
program. The previously mentioned IRQUE will focus on raising access to quality education at the
tertiary level and making it more accessible to deserving students, thus supporting both growth and equity
concerns.
59.

Gender
60.
While there is no freestanding program for gender activities proposed in this CAS, some
operations do include a specific gender focus, such as the JSDF-supported program to encourage and
expand women’s rural financial institutions and networks. Rather, the approach is to ensure that in
everything done by the Bank, the potential contribution of women is maximized in this country where
women’s roles are often discounted. For example, within CDD operations, efforts will be made to
mobilize women’s rural development societies-an approach that is already transforming villages in the
North. In the HIV/AIDS program, women’s groups will be empowered and sex workers-both women
and boys-will be targeted for support. In the health sector, women’s health issues and knowledge will
be a major target of the program, not least in the area of nutrition. Finally, in terms of the program for the
North East, there are many war widows who will receive particular support during the reconstruction and
reconciliation process. In summary, the CAS does not propose a gender program; but instead proposes a
program that will ensure that women’s contributions to development are realized, since it is clear in Sri
Lanka that whenever this happens the overall impact is significantly greater.

Safeguards
61.
Similarly, in implementing the CAS, ensuring the Bank’s safeguard policies will be crucial.
Major work has recently been undertaken to review financial and procurement issues, with the completion
of the CFAA and the CPAR (see Appendix V). Overall, financial management in Sri Lanka is quite
good, but a major effort is needed with regard to the oversight aspects. Thus, the CFAA calls for
particular attention to internal and external audit and to the role of Parliamentary Committees. In
procurement, the issue is not adequate controls, but rather overlapping control systems that end up with a
diffusion of responsibilities and with major delays to the procurement process. The CPAR calls for a
simplification of the regulatory framework for procurement, possibly through a new procurement law.

62.
A successful six-year program of support to environmental capacity-building is drawing to a
close. Capability in the sector is quite high and awareness exceptionally so. Continued strengthening is
needed--especially in the area of natural resources management-and will be primarily supported by a

SRI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

Page 20 of 31

new ADB-financed program. The high degree of collaboration between the Bank and ADB will continue
in implementing this program, with the Bank serving on the project steering committee and Bank staff
participating in ADB implementation efforts.
63.
Finally, social development issues have come to the forefront, with significant resettlement of
IDPs with Bank support and a major reconciliation program. As part of the IDP process, the resettlement
regulations have been revised to a standard that meets the Bank’s guidelines. Furthermore, the Bank
plans to post a Post-Conflict Adviser for the South Asia Region in Colombo and a social development
adviser is also being recruited. As mentioned, a note summarizing safeguard issues and assessing
capacity will be submitted to the Board along with the first PRSC in FY03.
Summary of Outcomes
64.
In preparing the CAS, the Bank’s country team for Sri Lanka has developed a comprehensive
country program results framework that links together the different levels of results-Le., the country’s
longer-term development agenda based on the PRSRSL and the shorter-term goals to be achieved durin
the CAS period and which are supported by the Bank‘s interventions (in partnership with other donors)18.
The key priority base case “CAS Outcomes’’have been summarized in Table 3 above.
65.
Both the Government and the Bank realize that an effective monitoring and evaluation system is
critical for tracking implementation of the PRS and hence, the CAS outcomes. There is much work ahead
in data collection, analysis and its linkages with policy and the monitoring of inputs, outputs and
outcomes. Particularly weak are the current institutional arrangements in Sri Lanka to coordinate the
monitoring and evaluation efforts. An immediate challenge is to enhance the capacity of the Department
of Census and Statistics to be able to conduct the key surveys-Le., the HlES and the Consumer Finance
and Socioeconomic Survey (CFSS)-required to deepen poverty diagnostics and monitoring at
appropriate intervals. An integral part of poverty monitoring and impact is also the participatory
component to assess access and consumer satisfaction with service delivery. During the initial phases of
CAS implementation, the Bank will place specific emphasis on addressing these capacity constraints. As
one example of how this will be done, the capacity of the Department of Census and Statistics will be
enhanced in the context of the on-going Economic Reform Technical Assistance Project. Furthermore,
the program of the WBI (see paragraphs 66-69 below) will also help to build monitoring and evaluation
capacity. These and other efforts will clearly facilitate the monitoring of the CAS outcomes. At the time
of the CAS Progress Report-Le., two years from now-this particular aspect will receive special
attention. It may be the case that CAS outcomes will need to be adapted in the light of experiences.

B.

Bank Group Scenarios

Capacity Building
66.
As mentioned, an important cross-cutting theme of the CAS is capacity building. To be able to
achieve the CAS and PRSP outcomes and, more fundamental, to be able to monitor and evaluate progress
toward achieving these outcomes, there is an urgent need to build capacity in Sri Lanka. Throughout the
IDA lending program, there are numerous sectoral operations (e.g., health and education) and technical
assistance operations (e.g., economic and public sector reform) which provide support in this regard. In
addition, key pieces of the non-lending program-e.g., public expenditure, poverty and reviewing
implementation of social policies/programs-will be carried out jointly with local counterparts, both
public and private/academic, to strengthen in-country capacity for this essential analytical work. These
17

activities will be fully coordinated with and reinforced by the World Bank Institute (WB1)-for
Lanka is a focus country-which will also play a leading role in the capacity building efforts.

which Sri

67.
WBI will support the CAS peace, growth and equity themes through a variety of face-to-face and
distance learning programs (see Appendix VII). With the formal launching of the Sri Lanka Distance
Learning Center in February 2003, WBI will be increasingly making use of this facility to reach clients in
Sri Lanka. The WBI program will be continuously assessed and adapted to ensure that it is responsive to
key institutional capacity weaknesses and bottlenecks in the country. The main priorities for capacity
enhancement are in the areas of PRS implementation, governance and the media. In addition, other
priorities are in health, nutrition and population, education and rural development.

68.
Related to cementing and strengthening the PRS process, WBI will develop programs to: (i)
support the establishment of an on-going process of consultation in Sri Lanka; (ii) help Government
develop firm linkages and appropriate mechanisms between PRS objectives and budgetinghesource
planning, including inter-governmental public finances at both the central and decentralized levels, and
(iii) build capacity in designing and implementing a “citizen’s scorecard.” In the area of governance, to
assist in the implementation of CFAA recommendations, WBI will engage in programs to strengthen the
public accounts and parliamentary committees, focusing on the role of Parliament in the budget and PRS
process. Finally, related to the media, programs to enhance the reporting skills of journalists-in English,
Sinhalese and Tamil-will be developed and implemented.
69.
The PRS learning program is expected to support the achievement of the CAS growth and equity
outcomes by strengthening capacity to implement growth-oriented and pro-poor budgets. Strengthening
of Parliament under the governance program also contributes to the achievement of the growth and equity
outcomes. The development of parliamentary capacity would ensure that: (i) public resource allocation is
consistent with constituent demands, as well as with the country’s development objectives; (ii) funds are
not misappropriated; (iii) fiscal transparency is maintained; and (iv) PRS expenditures result in improved
service delivery. The media program is cross-cutting in nature and is expected to contribute to the
achievement of outcomes in all three thematic areas. Generally, it will help to increase transparency of
the public decision-making process, which in turn will improve accountability. This process will
eventually increase the overall governance and efficiency of development activities. The media will
receive training on covering the development needs of a diverse, multi-ethnic society--crucial to the
country’s efforts to sustain the peace process. Finally, programs to support other CAS objectives will
contribute to achieving the equity outcomes through improving public sector service delivery capability in
health (HIV/AIDs communications), education (developing and implementing national education
assessments) and rural development (integrated water resources planning).

IDA Non-Lending Program
70.
The IDA program is founded on a significantly augmented program of Analytical and Advisory
Activities (AAA; see Table 4). Given the strong analytical capabilities existing in Sri Lanka, AAA will
all be carried out in conjunction with Sri Lankan agencies, both within Government and the network of
research institutions and universities. The AAA program falls into three broad types of activity:
First, there are major knowledge gaps that need to be filled. These include areas such as poverty
mapping and poverty in the North East, the investment climate, sources of growth and progress
towards achieving the MDGs.

SRI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

Second, there are areas of
analysis specifically requested by
the Government. These include
topics such as urbanization and the
role of local government and the
reform of the welfare system, It is
anticipated that further requests of
this type-both through Bank staff
and technical assistance (TA)-will
be forthcoming and as such, the
ability of the Bank to respond to
such requests will be retained.
Third, there is AAA that is
necessary as the basis for future
lending, especially for sectoral
programs.
Work in health,
education and land are specific
examples of this, to help define the
priorities
for
future public
expenditure and reform.

71.
One of the early programs
proposed for support-the
e-Lanka
program-is itself about the generation
and management of knowledge for
development. In terms of allocation of
the administrative budget, the AAA
program will receive an allocation similar to that of the lending program. All core diagnostic economic
and sector work will have been completed by the end of FY03, with the exception of the DPWCEM that
will be carried out in FYM1*.

IDA Lending Scenarios
72.
The FY03-FY06 base case lending program consists of about four projects per year for a total of
US$SOO million of IDA resources (see Table 5). While this lending amount is significantly higher than
the amount approved during the last CAS period, such an increase is based on a dramatic change both in
the peace prospects and the economic policy framework and is merely a restoration of a “normal” lending
program for Sri Lanka in line with its IDA allocations.
73.
As mentioned, in each year the lending program would be anchored in a PRSC providing
program support to the implementation of the PRS. It is envisaged that the four PRSCs might account for
close to half of the total four-year lending program. This would be complemented by two to four
investmenthectoral operations per year to support key programs in the focus areas. Given the intensity of
the conflict, Sri Lanka qualifies for IDA grants for a limited period of time-Le., FY03 and FY04. In
FY03, the IDA grant amount-ver
and above that approved in December 2002 for the National

In summary: (i) the CPAR and CFAA are on-going and will be finalized in FY03; (ii) a Poverty Assessment was
finalized in FYOl and will be updated in FY05; (iii) a Public Expenditure Review was completed in FY97 and
continuous public expenditure analysis is a key part of the CAS program; and (iv) the last CEM was canied out in
FYOO and the DPWCEM emphasizing growth will be undertaken in FY04.

An assumption for Sri Lanka to
remain in the base case is continued
progress in implementing the peace process.
In addition, Sri Lanka must meet the triggers
shown in Table 6 that cover: (i) maintaining
macroeconomic performance, with special
emphasis on fiscal issues; (ii) successful
implementation of the economic reform
program as contained in the PRS; (iii) progress in addressing equity concerns; and (iv) portfolio
management. These are broad policy and performance indicators. The “intermediate indicators” in
column four of the “Thematic Matrices” in Annex B l l will be used to measure the status of these
indicators. Thus, for example, improvements in the quality of education would be measured inter alia by
the national learning assessments; factor market deepening by the extent of commercialization of the
People’s Bank and labor market legislation and fiscal reform by the size of the public sector domestic
borrowing requirement. There are thus a series of specific measures and indicators that will be used to
assess performance against these broader categories.
75.
The high case would have a lending volume approximately 25 percent above the level of the base
case. In addition to maintaining performance as envisioned under the base case, the expectation would be
for high performance in the following areas:
Accelerated structural reform, especially in financial sector and public expenditure management;
Progress in private participation in infrastructure; and
0
Deepening of public sector management reforms in the areas of staffing and decentralization
beyond that currently envisaged.
0
0

For the first case, it is proposed that the high case would be reflected in larger PRSCs. In the
76.
second, this would trigger specific operations to support those reforms, notably possible investments
supporting private participation in water, railway concessioning, landlord port arrangements or IDA
guarantees for private power generation investments or toll roads. For the third case, this would trigger
additional resources for the public sector management technical assistance programs to cover the costs of
re-deployment. Given the triggers, it is unlikely that a high case scenario would be reached for about a
year.

77.
The CAS envisions two types of low case scenarios. The first would see lending fall to levels
similar to those of the last five years-on the order of US$250 million over the four year period-with the
elimination of the PRSCs, the e-Lanka Project and the technical assistance operations for economic and
public sector reform. This low case would be triggered by either: (i) the breakdown of the peace process
and the resumption of hostilities, but essentially limited to the North East; or (ii) the lagging behind of
structural reforms and a failure to maintain satisfactory macroeconomic performance as evaluated by IMF
PRGF program. The deeper low case scenario would be an exit strategy. If the peace process were to
break down entirely and hostilities were to break out on a national scale, there would be no new lending
and in all probability, it would be necessary to suspend all operations. Nevertheless, it should be
emphasized that such a scenario has never been seen in Sri Lanka during the 20 years of conflict and is
thus considered highly unlikely.

IFC Program
78.
As discussed above, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) will support the growth agenda
through investments that contribute to the CAS outcomes related to establishing and fostering private
sector participation. IFC will focus on investments which:

Develop financial markets, increase the availability of financing for SMEs, expand housing
finance, add value to the on-going consolidation of financial services, or support the growth of
pri vately-managed contractual savings institutions;
Expand the private provision of infrastructure services, especially in power, ports, water and
telecommunications;

Page 25 of 31

SRI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

Support the growth of export-oriented manufacturing and service companies, including IT
companies; and
Support privatization.
In addition, IFC will explore new opportunities to support the growth of SMEs in conjunction with multilateral and bi-lateral partners.

MIGA Program
79.
During the CAS period, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will explore the
possibility of working with Sri Lanka’s investment promotion intermediaries to improve their investor
outreach capabilities through the use of the FDZ Xchange. This e-mail based technology developed by
MIGA allows promotion agencies to send customized information to international investors that matches
their specified interest in a region, country or sector. With funding provided by the Gateway Foundation,
MIGA is prepared to offer hands-on support to appropriate content partners in Sri Lanka who would make
use of the FDZ Xchange. As foreign investor interest in Sri Lanka grows in a post-conflict environment,
MIGA would also be ready to help reduce non-commercial risks for foreign direct investors through the
provision of guarantees to qualified investments against currency inconvertibility and transfer restrictions,
war and civil disturbance, expropriation and breach of contract.

Progress under the Last CAS and Lessons Learned
80.
When the previous CAS was presented to the Board, due to the prevailing uncertaintiesincluding the conflict-the low case was considered the most likely scenario. By the time of the Progress
Report, Sri Lanka had moved to the mid-base case following the initiation of policy reforms in early1997. However, the country slipped back into the low case in mid-1999 as the Government became
preoccupied with elections, the conflict escalated and reform efforts weakened. As a result, lending to Sri
Lanka was relatively modest, with just twelve IDA credits for a total of approximately US$370 millionor an average of two credits per year for an annual amount of US$62 million-approved during the period
FY 97-FY02.
81.
As part of the CAS process, a CAS
Completion Report for the 1996 CAS has been
prepared (see Appendix 111). This analysis
identifies the major factors-Le., political
instability and the lack of ownership, which
often resulted in complex projects that
suffered from weak implementation-that
contributed to a lack of significant progress
towards implementing the CAS program.
Similar lessons were highlighted in the
Country Assistance Note (CAN) carried out
by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) in December 1998 (see Box 5). These
lessons are being taken forward in the design
of this CAS in a number of ways, including:

Box 5: Lessons of the Country Assistance Note (CAN)
The main lessons from the December 1998 OED CAN were:
The physical components of projects-while implemented
well-were subject to increasing implementation delays,
due primarily to procurement problems;
Policy changes and institutional reforms were difficult to
achieve; therefore, the Bank’s assistance should have been
more sensitive to the political cycle and substantial
preparation and consultation with stakeholders;
The Bank did not give adequate attention to the possible
divisive impact of its programs-e.g., several large
education projects could have had greater value if they had
fostered the role of education in promoting social inclusion
in a more prominent manner; and
Although the Bank’s analysis and advice were sound and its
strategic objectives were well-aligned with Government’s,
only limited institutional framework changes were made.

Adopting a more realistic approach to the issues of political instability and ownership,
specifically by focusing more on: (i) AAA and policy dialogue before jumping prematurely into
project preparation; (ii) supporting specific, opportunistic reforms put forward by serious
champions with demonstrated implementation ability; and (iii) capacity building;

Page 26 of 31

SRI U N k A Country Assistance Strategy

*

Placing greater emphasis on project implementation. In the past, project preparation has often
taken more than three years and consumed a substantial share of the administrative budget,
thereby leaving limited resources for implementation efforts. In the future, project preparation
will be shortened and greater resources will be allocated for implementation;
Developing simpler, yet larger projects supporting either CDD approaches or comprehensive
sectoraUmulti-sectoralefforts; and
Being more selective and focused in areas of engagement, in addition to shifting towards more
use of programmatic/adjustment lending instruments.

IDA Portfolio Management
82.
After a steady decline during the 199Os, since FYOO the IDA portfolio for Sri Lanka has shown a
slight increase in the number of projects, annual lending levels and overall disbursements (see Table 7).
Currently, the portfolio consists of thirteen IDA projects and one Global Environmental Facility (GEF)
operation with total commitments of about US$470 million, net of cancellations and an undisbursed IDA
balance of about US$250 milli~n’~.

Although the portfolio has experienced some deterioration since the last CAS, since FY02 there
have been improvements as a result of the pro-active measures (discussed below) taken by both the
Government and IDA2’. The most important systemic issues affecting portfolio implementation include:
(i) lack of accountability and commitment; (ii) lack of continuity in carrying out reform initiatives; (iii)

Recently approved projects not yet effective-Le., Economic Reform Technical Assistance and National HIV/AIDs
Prevention-are included in these totals. The portfolio restructuring-in which US$31 million was reallocated to
provide support to the North East Emergency Reconstruction Program-is not counted as a stand-alone project.

20

Going into FY02, four projects were identified as “projects-at-risk” and four were on the “watch list” (Le., potential
projects-at-risk). By mid-FY03-through restructurings and/or cancellations-there were only two projects-at-risk and
one on the watch list.

85.
IDA’S portfolio management plan focuses on enhancing quality, with special attention paid to
sociaYenvironmenta1 safeguards and fiduciary controls. For example, quality enhancement reviews are
being taken to achieve high quality at entry and emphasis is being placed on establishing procurement
planshystems before project effectiveness. Compliance with social and environmental safeguards will be
strengthened through systematic sector reviews, particularly for the energy, infrastructure and irrigation
sectors and by building local ownership and capacity to address social and environmental concerns.
Greater emphasis will be placed on CDD activities and multi-sectoral approaches, both in rural and urban
settings.

86.
To ensure more effective portfolio implementation, specific supervision strategies for each sector
are being developed. Regional sector specialists will provide quality oversight, while staff in the
Colombo Office-supported by the New Delhi procurement hub-will interact with project staff and
other stakeholders on day-today implementation issues. The underlying principle will be on pre-emptive
action to resolve issues before they become full-fledged problems. In addition, more interaction will be
undertaken with the media, as this is an essential part of promoting understanding and awareness of the
portfolio objectives and for engaging civil society in an open and transparent manner.

IFC Portfolio
87.
As of January 31, 2003, IFC had outstanding committed investments in 14 companies in Sri
Lanka with a total exposure of US$74 million, consisting of US$68 million from its own account (net
exposure) and US$6 million from participating banks. This includes projects in the financial sector,
infrastructure, general manufacturing, health care and tourism. In the infrastructure sector, IFC

SRI LANK4 Country Assistance Strategy

Page 28 of 31

participated in the South Asia Gateway Terminal project together with ADB, Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) and the Private Sector Investment Development Corporation (PSIDC)
to develop a quay of the Colombo port as a private container terminal on a 30-year build, operate and
transfer (BOT) basis. It also invested in Asia Power-Sri Lanka’s first private power generation
project-and Suntel-one of Sri Lanka’s two mobile operators. In the financial sector, IFC activities
have included investments in venture capital funds, housing finance companies, commercial banks, the
country’s first credit rating agency and support of capital markets through credit lines to leasing
companies and other non-bank financial institutions. Portfolio performance is excellent, with no loan
arrears.

C.

IDA Eligibile and IBRD Creditworthiness

88.
While Sri Lanka’s per capita income level is approaching the IDA operational cut-off (US$875),
the country is currently not considered creditworthy for IBRD lending because of political risks and its
precarious fiscal position. Previous reviews have concluded that Sri Lanka’s creditworthiness was not
strong enough to justify access to IBRD resources because of: (i) the civil conflict; (ii) high total public
debt and inadequate fiscal performance; and (iii) vulnerability to external shocks.
89.
Nevertheless, given the policy performance envisioned in the base case scenario and the strong
prospects for peace, it is possible that Sri Lanka might be deemed eligible for IBRD lending by the time
of the next CAS, or even before-Le., possibly in a high case scenario. With regard to potential IBRD
lending in the coming years, the following possibilities exist:

In a base case scenario, Sri Lanka would remain an IDA-only country during the entire CAS
period (Le., FY03-FY06). A creditworthiness analysis would be carried out in mid-FY06-i.e., to
coincide with the preparation of the next CAS-to determine Sri Lanka’s readiness for transitioning
to an a IDNIBRD blend-country during the next CAS period; and
If the triggers for the high case scenario are met and economic performance is in line with the
medium-term economic framework set out in Table 2, a review of IBRD creditworthiness could be
carried out earlier-Le., early-FY0621. If under this review, Sri Lanka is deemed creditworthy, then
the high case scenario could include a limited amount of IBRD lending-primarily for private
participation in infrastructure projects. Otherwise, the high case would be an IDA-only scenario.

IV.

A.

IMPLEMENTING THE CAS

Partnerships

There are three types of partnership that are important for this CAS. First, there are official
90.
partnerships. Of these, the most important are with JBIC and ADB, the two largest providers of finance
to Sri Lanka. The two institutions are currently preparing their assistance strategies and clear efforts have
been made to ensure congruence. In February 2003, the Bank and JBIC co-hosted a workshop of the
three institutions in Tokyo to discuss their respective strategies and fine-tune coordination. The workshop
was extremely successful and permitted the agencies to ensure complementarity between their strategies,
~

21

In moving towards a scenario in which Sri Lanka is considered IBRD creditworthy, first and foremost, there is a need
for the country to develop a track record in a number of areas, including solidifying the peace process and macro
stability, most importantly in regaining strong growth and fiscal paths. Such a track record could only be established
based on the observation of economic and financial performance indicators through 2005, including public debt and
fiscal debt levels reached by end-2005. The economic targets as set out in Table 2 thereby provide useful benchmarks
against which to assess economic performance and progress.

SRl LANKA Country Assistance Strategy

Page 29 of 31

especially in terms of support to the North East, support to implementation of the PRS, financing of
infrastructure and balancing lending. There is a very reassuring degree of complementarity between the
strategies-Le., the Bank is addressing macro constraints on business, while the ADB is focusing on PSD
institutions and JBIC is providing support to financial institutions. ADB’s focus on sector policy in roads
and power has facilitated JBIC financing in these sectors. In education, the Bank is focusing on primary
and tertiary education, while ADB interventions are focused on secondary and vocational skills. The
Bank is also working closely with the Japanese authorities to ensure the success of the Tokyo Financing
Conference for Sri Lanka, scheduled for June 9-10,2003.
91.
The relationship with the UN system is also strong, and ADB, LO,UNDP, UNHCR, UNICEF
and the Bank have been working especially closely together with respect to assessing the needs of the
North and East. In addition, coordination with the IMF has been consistently excellent. Currently, the
Bank’s PRSC is being prepared in parallel with the IMF PRGF and the two institutions are working
closely to ensure that the programs are consistent and reinforce each other. As another example of the
close coordination, the assessment of the PRS was carried out by a joint Bank/IMF team.
92.
An important part of the coordination efforts revolves around selectivity in implementing the
PRS-Le., development partners are working together to ensure that duplication is minimized, while at
the same time, all essential components of the PRS are receiving adequate support. The multi-lateral and
bi-lateral partnerships for implementing the PRS are summarized in Table 8.

93.
This being said, nevertheless, Government leadership of the coordination of development partners
leaves much to be desired. This is an area that the Bank is working with ADB in trying to improve,
especially to ensure continuity between meetings of the Development Forum.
94.
The second type of partnership is with the private sector--especially, the Chambers of
Commerce. These are exceptionally well-organized in Sri Lanka and routinely prepare inputs to policy
formulation, such as comments on the draft PRS and suggestions for the budget. The Ceylon Chamber of
Commerce-one the oldest in the world-is collaborating with the Bank to prepare the Development
Gateway for Sri Lanka and will be an important partner in carrying out the investment climate work and
other initiatives affecting the private sector.
95.
Partnership with civil society is mixed. On the development implementation front, it is going
well in such projects as the NEIAP, in which Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are performing
strongly in their role as social mobilizers. NGOs are also playing a significant part in the North East
Emergency Reconstruction Program. However, there is not a very well-organized framework for policy
consultation, and no structured framework exists for exchange of views between the Govemment, the
Bank and civil society. Thus, there are those who felt fully consulted on the PRS and others who never
saw it. This will receive increased attention during this CAS period, especially through the efforts of
WBI. Priority will also be placed on building better partnerships with the media and improving the
Bank’s external communications efforts with regard to both lending and non-lending activities.

B.

Monitoring of Outcomes

96.
As mentioned above (see paragraph 65), effective monitoring and evaluation is critical for
tracking implementation of the PRS, and hence, the CAS outcomes. The Thematic Matrices4ontained
in Annex B 1 I-identify clear, specific indicators that will be used to measure progress toward achieving
the CAS outcomes. In the coming months, as emphasis is placed on monitoring and evaluation systems,
for each of the indicators, annual targets for the CAS period will be established and agreed with the
Government. Preliminary indications are that sufficient information is available to carry out this exercise
as envisioned. However, there is still the need to determine whether or not valid and verifiable data
exist-including baseline information-to measure real progress towards achieving all of the CAS
outcomes.
C.

Risks

97.
There are five types of risk associated with this CAS. In Box 7 these risks are listed in order of
importance, with the first two-peace and politics-being the most critical. This is therefore a relatively
risky strategy. It is intentionally so, because of the historic moment at which Sri Lanka finds itself. The
Government and indeed the LTTE are themselves being very bold and taking enormous risks with respect
to their own political futures, for the sake of a better future for the people of Sri Lanka. It seems only
reasonable that the Bank should also be prepared to accept the risks of this strategy so long as the two
parties remain committed to achieving peace and laying the foundation for a renewed attack on poverty.
It is therefore a strategy that has high risks, but potentially very high rewards in a country that for too long
has been performing below its full potential. Sri Lanka now has the opportunity finally to break out of
the conflict and follow a path of sustained progress for all its people. The World Bank Group can make a
substantial contribution to this process.

98.
To handle these risks, several mitigation
strategies are being adopted. First, with Bank
support, a major communications program is being
developed to present and explain the reform
program to the population. This should reduce
resistance to the reforms. In addition, a major
program of technical assistance for the reform
process has been approved-Le., the Economic
Reform Technical Assistance Project-which
should boost implementation capacity. Both the
IMF and the Bank will also provide support to
strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capacity
building effort.
99.
The political risks are harder to mitigate,
but should be tractable so long as the Government
retains the confidence of Parliament.
The
successful implementation of the reform program
and successful negotiation of the peace process are
the best guarantees of this. With regard to the
peace process, there is every indication of strong
commitment from both sides and the best prospect
to supporting this is an early demonstration of the
benefits of peace. Thus, the Bank-along with
other development partners-will provide early
support for reconstruction efforts as part of the
strategy. Finally, the external shocks require that
foreign reserves be built up as quickly as possible.
This would require appealing for this type of for
external assistance during the forthcoming
Financing Conference for Sri Lanka planned for
June in Tokyo.

Box 7 : CAS Risks
Peace: the biggest uncertainty is whether peace will indeed
be achieved this time. It has been noted that the process is
going remarkably well and that both sides appear
determined. But after 20 years and several failed attempts,
claiming certainty would be foolish. The Bank is ensuring
resources are available for reconstruction and has a strategy
in the event hostilities were to resume.
Politics: Sri Lanka is going through “cohabitation”-i.e., a
President from one party and a Government from anotherfor the first time. The President has the constitutional power
to dismiss the Government and call elections. Such an event
would obviously disrupt both the peace process and
economic reform. The President has stated that she will not
call elections as long the Government continues to
command the confidence of Parliament. But, a political
crisis remains a risk for this strategy.
Economic reform: the Government is committed to reform,
but could face serious opposition to some of its policies,
such as in the financial sector. In addition, if economic
reform were to threaten the peace process Government
might slow down. Thus, the level of support is linked to
both the pace and quality of reform.
External: Sri Lanka remains a country with heavy external
dependence. If the situation in the Middle East were to
deteriorate, intemational tourism and remittances might
decline significantly just as the Sri Lankan economy is
recovering.
Implementation: the CAS proposes a major increase in
lending at a time when Sri Lanka’s own resources are
heavily stretched, raising the question of absorptive
capacity. Significant resources will be transferred in the
form of program assistance. This is easily absorbed and in
and of itself makes it easier for project assistance to be
absorbed.

100. Sri Lanka now has the opportunity to break out of the conflict and follow a path of sustained
development and progress for all its people. This CAS presents a coherent strategy for how the World
Bank Group should support Sri Lanka to help this opportunity be realized.

The Root Causes of the Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka’
Background
The ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka has many root causes and consequences that are closely interlinked. However, given its complexities, it should not be assumed that these causes are part of linear
historical processes where one event led to another. Often many of the issues that may be regarded as
root causes arose within a single but extended context and equally as often, simultaneously. It is
primarily within the context of ethnic politics that language and education policy can be located.
However, for discussion purposes it is necessary to separate these issues as clearly identifiable themes
that would emerge in any analysis of the Sri Lankan conflict. In general, these themes can be broadly
identified as:
Ethnic politics and the interpretation of the past;
Politics of language;
Politics of education; and
Other factors, including employment and land.

Demographic Patterns
Sri Lankan societ is an ethno-religious mosaic2 and within the ethnic groups, there are clear
religious divisions as wellY. To a certain extent, ethnicity and religion also have a regional basis, which
is a significant reason why the Tamil militancy has a strong geographical dimension, which extended to
the demand of a separate independent state. Of the ethnic and religious groups, Tamil Hindus
predominate in the Northern Province and maintain a significant presence in the Eastern Province. The
Eastern Province is an ethnically mixed area where Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese are found in sizeable
numbers even though Tamils have a slightly higher statistical edge. Indian Tamils-the descendants of
laborers brought from Southern India by the British in the 19” century to work on tea and coffee
estates-are concentrated in parts of the Central, Uwa and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. Sinhalese
Buddhists predominate in all parts of the country except the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Muslims
have a significant concentration in the Eastern Province, but generally are scattered throughout the
country. Christians maintain a significant presence in the coastal areas as a result of over 500 years of
constant European colonial presence and the consequent Christianization of significant numbers of the
population in these areas. However, Christians are found in all parts of the country in small numbers.
Malays are mostly concentrated in and around the city of Colombo and the Western Province.
By the time Sri Lanka achieved independence in 1948 from the UK, there were expectations that
the country would become a model democracy. Universal adult franchise had been introduced in the
1

This draws heavily from “The Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka: A Historical and Sociopolitical Outline”, by Dr. Sasanka
Perera, of the Department of Sociology, the University of Colombo, December 1999. At the time this paper was
written, Dr. Perera was a full-time staff member of the World Bank. The views and opinions expressed here are those
of the CAS team and do not necessarily represent those of the World Bank or the Government of Sri Lanka.

2

Based on 1981 statistics, the population is as follows: Sinhalese: 74.0%;Sri Lankan Tamils: 12.7%;Indian Tamils:
5.5%; Muslims: 7.1%; Burghers: 0.3%; Malays (followers of Islam): 0.3%; and numerous other small groups: 0.2%.

3

Buddhists make up 69.3% of the population; Hindus, account for 15.5%; Muslims-who constitute the only ethnic
group who have a single term to denote ethnicity and religion-along with Malays (also Muslims) account for 7.6%.
Christians account for 7.4%.

1931, democratic institutions and traditions had been in place and political violence was not an issue.
Moreover, by the 1950s literacy in Sri Lanka was on the rise and there were no serious indicators of
economic or social catastrophes of the years to come. However, even before independence, there were
clear indications of ethnic politics that were to emerge later.

The Emergence of Ethnic Politics
Relations between Tamils and Sinhalese have not always or consistently been antagonistic. This
happened only in times of external threats from South India after the formulation of clear Sinhalese and
Tamil ethnic or cultural identities in the 9* (or 12*) century. These wars were wars of dominance fought
between regional rulers and were not ‘race’ wars as defined later. Historical chronicles compiled by
Sinhalese Buddhist monks defined these wars as campaigns undertaken to protect Buddhism and the
Sinhalese nation. Mainly reinforced by formal education, many Sinhalese accept these problematic
interpretations as fact today. In the eyes of many Sri Lankans, these interpretations seem to suggest a
long and bloody tradition in which hope for reconciliation is minimal. Significantly, these
interpretations-with their potent and emotional contents-have also found their way into school
textbooks, which is an important aspect of social and political socialization in contemporary Sri Lanka.
Forces of Sinhalese nationalism perpetuating notions of eternal conflict with Tamils had been
gathering strength since before independence. Many of them were Sinhalese-educated rural people
whose nationalist aspirations for cultural transformation, power and status did not automatically
materialize with independence. Soon after independence it was clear that a conflict was emerging
between Sinhalese-educated rural elite and the English-educated urban ruling elite.
Meanwhile, one million Indian Tamils were disenfranchised in 1948 under the Ceylon
Citizenship Act. Of this, approximately 350,000 were repatriated to India under the Indo-Ceylon
Agreement of 1964. Over the years, subsequent governments conferred citizenship rights to the rest.
The Ceylon Citizenship Act served to reinforce ethnic politics and reduced the electoral leverage of the
Indian Tamils who remain an impoverished community today.

Ethnic Conflict and Language
In addition to the barriers imposed by the continued use of the English language as the official
language after independence, the emerging nationalist forces perceived that Sri Lankan Tamils had
access to a disproportionate share of power as a consequence of educational opportunities in the colonial
period and were also disproportionately represented in the civil administration. Moreover, considerable
mercantile interests were also controlled by non-Sinhalese groups. These fears and concerns were a
basis for the politics of language that was to emerge.

As early as 1944, politicians proposed resolutions in Parliament to declare Sinhalese the official
language, while other amendments proposed both Sinhalese and Tamil as official languages4. A 1944
resolution specified that Sinhalese and Tamil would become the languages of instruction in schools,
examinations for public services and legislative proceedings. The resolution was approved by 27 to 2 in
the Sinhalese-dominated legislature. Committees were established to advise on how these changes were
to be implemented, however, there was little progress in implementing the policy. In 1956, S.W.R.D
Bandaranaike was elected Prime Minister with a main election promise of establishing Sinhalese as the
official language of the country, replacing English. The new government fulfilled this promise-through

4

In the colonial period, both Tamil and Sinhalese politicians espoused the idea of swabasha, which, literally translates
into ‘native languages’. By this, they meant that in the post independent period primacy of place should be given to
local languages, namely Sinhalese and Tamil.

the passage of the so-called “Sinhalese Only Bill” (Official Language Act, No. 33 of 1956)-soon
the election giving no status of parity to the Tamil language.

after

The language issue in many ways brought the Sinhalese-Tamil conflict into the forefront of Sri
Lankan politics. In terms of the dominant strands of Sinhalese nationalism, the Sinhalese language along
with the Buddhist religion necessarily had to occupy the pre-eminent position in society. This was
perceived to be the only way the glory of ancient Sinhalese civilization could be revitalized. Even
though Tamil has been decreed an official language along with Sinhalese in terms of the 13*
Amendment to the Constitution (in 1987), the damage caused by the politics of language generally
remain unaddressed. Moreover, the vast gap between the official recognition of Tamil as an official
language and the practical implementation of the provisions and conditions it entails, is yet to be
bridged.
Ethnic Conflict and Education
Since the 1970s, access to education-particularly access to higher education-has been
ethnicized. In addition, many other aspects of education-including the structural organization of
schools and universities, contents of textbooks and training of teachers-have impacted directly on
ethnic conflict. Compared to other ethnic and religious groups in the country, Tamils have had strong
cultural norms which valued education. Many Tamils attended English Ianguage schools which were the
passport to higher education and better employment in the colonial period. As a consequence of wellfunded American missionary activities, the Tamil-dominated Northern Province had comparatively
better facilities for English language and pre-university education.
There was also a limit beyond which Tamils could not be absorbed within the traditional landbased occupations in the arid areas where they predominated. This further encouraged many to seek
employment through education. The net result was the relative over-representation of Tamils in higher
education, professions and the administration in comparison to their status in the general population’.

In this context, post independence Sinhalese nationalism sought to curb the Tamil presence in
education and thus also in the professions and civil administration. While the passing of the “Sinhalese
Only Bill” was one attempt in this process, more direct hurdles were placed on the path of Tamils’
realization of educational goals since the 1970s. The constitutional provisions in the 1972 Constitution
favoring the Sinhalese language and Buddhist religion, along with their educational policies, convinced
many Tamils that they had been perceived as a marginal community.
From 1971 onwards, a new “standardization” policy was adopted, which ensured that the
number of students qualifying for university entrance from each language was Froportionate to the
number of students who sat for university entrance examination in that language . In real terms this
meant that Tamil speaking students had to score much higher than Sinhalese speaking students to gain
admission to universities. This also meant that for the first time, the integrity of university admissions
policy was tampered with by using ethnicity as a basis. In 1972, a district quota system was introduced
5

By independence, Tamils accounted for over 30% of govemment services admissions, a share larger than their
proportion in the general population-i.e., Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils have never totaled more than 25%. By 1956,
it is estimated that Tamils constituted 50% of the clerical personnel of the railway, postal and customs services, 60% of
all doctors, engineers and lawyers, and 40% of other labor forces.

Prior to this, individuals entered universities on the basis of national competitive examinations marked on a uniform
basis. Those who scored highest, gained access to different faculties in universities irrespective of their ethnicity or
districts from which they came. While there was no inherent bias, Tamils from Jaffna and Colombo did particularly
well-e.g., in the 1969-1970 intake to science and engineering courses, Tamils constituted 35% and over 45% of the
intake in medical faculties.

Appendix 1

in order to benefit those not having adequate access to educational facilities within each language. These
changes had a serious impact on the demographic patterns of university entry’.
In general, these policies seriously impacted upon not only the chances of Tamils to gain access
to higher education, but also on the overall process of ethnic relations as well. In 1977, the languagebased admission policy was abolished and since that time various adjustments have been introduced on
the basis of merit, district quotas, disadvantaged area quotas, etc. While the obvious ethno-linguistic
discrimination of the 1971 policy has long been dismantled, many Tamil youth still feel that they are
discriminated against in access to higher education.

Furthermore, the ethnic divisions in Sri Lanka tend to manifest within the education structure in
a number of other ways-Le., the organizational structure of educational institutions, the training of
teachers and the content of textbooks and syllabi-which are much more long lasting and far more
insidious than the more visible ethno-linguistic policies of the 1970s.
Related to the organizational structure of educational institutions, it is clear that language-based
segregation takes place. This does not apply to privately-owned institutions in which instruction is in
English, but applies to institutions with more than one language of instruction (such as some universities,
mixed media schools and technical institutes) where a system of internal segregation takes place. In real
terms Sinhalese students are segregated into Sinhalese-language schools and Tamil and Tamil-speaking
Muslim students are segregated into Tamil-language schools. If they enter universities or technical
institutes, this segregation is likely to continue unless they o t to, and have the money to receive, a nonsegregated further education in English in private institutions .

t

The training of teachers poses similar problems, as most teachers in the system today are
products of the segregated education system they are teaching in. Moreover, they are also trained in
institutions that are internally segregated except in the training of teachers specializing in subjects such
as English. Few teacher training institutions in operation today, have seriously taken into account the
need to train teachers who can teach in a context keeping in mind the challenges of a multicultural
society. There is a clear disjuncture between current state policy towards ethnic relations and the manner
in which teachers are trained.
Since the early-l98Os, many have stressed the role school texts play in shaping ethnic relations
in the country. Ideally, school texts (e.g., texts used for teaching religion, language, social studies, etc.)
should portray the multi-cultural reality of Sri Lankan society and address issues that are important in
this context while approaching the prescribed subject matter. School texts have been written, supervised,
produced and distributed by agencies of the state, meaning that their contents reflect state policy or
thinking. Furthermore, ethnic politics have also been played out in the process of text production. In
recent times some of the more problematic contents in these texts have been removed in the process of
revision and re-writing’. Ironically however, sometimes this has gone to the opposite extreme--e.g., in
some texts all references to ethnicity and related issues have been removed.
7

Tamil representation in the science-based disciplines fell from 35% in 1970 to 19% in 1975, while Sinhalese
representation in all disciplines increased quite dramatically.

8

Some state institutions (e.g., university departments where instruction is given in all three languages such as the
Department of Law at the University of Colombo) are exceptions to this as students can opt for the medium of
instruction of their choice. But given the legacy of segregated school education and the general poor state of English
language education, very few have the required background or make the choice to educate themselves in a nonsegregated environment even when given the choice.

9

Support for development of new textbooks, along with teacher training is being provided under two on-going IDA
projects: Second General Education (Cr. 3014-CE) and Teacher Education and Teacher Deployment (Cr. 288 1-CE).

Appendix I

Ethnic Conflict and Employment
As mentioned above, both language and education policies have placed barriers on employment,
especially in the administrative and professional ranks in which Tamils were at one point “overrepresented.” In the private sector-which for the most part continued to work in English-employment
opportunities for Tamils and other minorities remained relatively open. As a result, today some of the
leading business ventures in the country are Tamil-owned. However, as a result of the discrimination
that has occurred in state sector employment practices over time, there is a tendency among many Tamils
to perceive of themselves as generally discriminated against in employment. According to the census of
public sector and corporate sector employment in 1990, Sri Lankan Tamils accounted for 5.9% of those
employed in the state services. This represents a significant drop from earlier years.
Ethnic Conflict and the Issue of Land
The issue of ownership over and access to land has also been a consistent area in which ethnic
politics in Sri Lanka have manifested, and have sustained themselves over the years. As noted, one of
the peculiarities in the demographic patterns in Sri Lanka is the relative concentration of certain ethnic
groups in certain geographical regions. The clearest site of politics of land and ethnicity has been in the
sparsely populated areas of the dry zone in the North Central Province and the Eastern Province”. When
post independence governments decided to settle poor Sinhalese farmers from the densely populated wet
zone areas of the country, many Sinhalese politicians and people in general viewed the process as a
“reclamation and recreation in the present of the glorious Sinhalese Buddhist past.” The so-called
“colonization schemes’’ became an integral aspect of Sinhalese Buddhist ‘nation-building.’
Not surprisingly, the Tamils had a completely different perception of the colonization of the dry
zone. The notion of the ‘traditional Tamil homeland’ became a potent component of popular Tamil
political imagination. Since Sinhalese irrigation settlements in the North Central and Eastern Provinces
occurred under direct state sponsorship, it appeared to many Tamils as a deliberate attempt of the
Sinhalese-dominated state to marginalize them further by decreasing their numbers in the area. The
colonization schemes did alter the demographic patterns, particularly in the Eastern Province in a
significant way”.
A decision was made in the late-1970s to accelerate the development of the dry zone through the
“Accelerated Mahaweli Program,” that provided for the opening up of dry zone areas further for
agriculture and resettlement of people. Only in 1986, as a result of continuing Tamil agitations, did the
government agree to allocate the remaining land under the Mahaweli Program on the basis of the ethnic
distribution of each ethnic group in the total population.

Meanwhile, the Muslim community tended to reject the countervailing notion of a traditional
Tamil homeland in the North East region. Growing cooperation between the security forces and Muslim
home guards led to LTTE attacks on Muslim villages in the East, armed counter attacks on Tamil
communities in the South East and to the eviction of 55,000 Muslims from the North in 1990 most of
whom remain displaced today.

10

The dry zone areas of the North Central Province had special socio-cultural significance for Sinhalese in term of their
popular imagination of the past-Le., it was area where a number of ancient Sinhalese capitals were located in a time
considered as the “golden era of Sinhalese civilization.” It was also where many of the ruins of these ancient cities and
citadels continued to be a source of pride to many Sinhalese.

II

According to census data, the Sinhalese population-which constituted 3% of the population in the Trincomalee
District in the east in 1921-was 30% in 1981. Similarly, Amparai District which used to be a largely Tamil and
Muslim-majority area is now a Sinhalese-majority area.

Appendix I
Page 6 of 6

Loss of Confidence in Non-violent and Democratic Politics
Ethnic politics and fears of discrimination led Tamil politicians in the Federal direction from a
very early stage of recent Sri Lankan politics. Since the 1930s, and much more clearly since the 1950s,
Tamil political parties have been asking for greater political autonomy for the areas in which they
predominate. Such a devolution of power has been recognized at different times as a means to diffuse
tensions between the two groups. A number of pacts had been formulated to define the modalities for
devolution of power, including the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam Pact in July 1957 that offered a
framework for regional devolution. But due to various political pressures, the provisions of the pact
were never implemented. In 1965, the Dudley-Chelvanayagam Pact was formulated and agreed upon.
But, yet again the provisions of this pact-quite similar to the earlier one-were annulled.
The failure to implement these proposals led to Tamil demands for separation, instead of
Federalism that they had been mostly seeking up to that point. On the part of many Tamils-particularly
Tamil youth from the north-the failure of these pacts also marked a disintegration of confidence in
parliamentary politics in general. In 1977, the Tamil United Liberation Front won an overwhelming
electoral victory on a highly charged political platform of separatism. In 1980, the District Development
Council Act was passed in Parliament and elections to the councils were held in July 1981. But given
the lack of government commitment to decentralization of power, this attempt also proved to be a
failure. After this point, there were clear indications that the politics of Tamil society were shifting from
the commitment to parliamentary democracy (held by its conservative leaders) to a commitment to
armed struggle (held by considerable sections of Tamil youth). In 1979, the government enacted the
draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act as a an interim measure, but in 1982 it was amended to be part of
the permanent law.

The Emergence of Armed Conflict
Until the early-l980s, ethnic conflict was primarily limited to the political arena where
destruction to property and life was minimal. However, violence had occurred on number of occasions,
such as in the passing of the “Sinhalese Only Bill” in 1956. Similar ethnic riots involving Tamils and
Sinhalese occurred in 1958, 1977 and 1981, with the most violent and destructive taking place in July
1983. Many observers see the violence of July 1983 as a turning point in the conflict.
After the early-1980s, such sporadic cases of violence gradually gave way to institutionalized
political violence which became a main feature of the conflict. At this stage, organized or
institutionalized political violence was widely utilized by both the political parties in power and Tamil
youth who organized themselves into armed guerrilla outfits. This development marked the
militarization and the steady brutalization of the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict.
The failure of parliamentary politics and the entrenchment of ethnic politics which led to
frustration among Tamil youth, eventually made some of these youth organize themselves into armed
groups for the ostensible purpose of seeking independence from Sinhalese domination. The first of these
groups was the Tamil Tigers which later came to be known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam or
LTTE. In 1978, the Tamil Tigers carried out a series of bank robberies and also assassinated a number
of police officers, many of whom were Tamil. Bank robberies and selected assassination of individuals
within the Tamil community (who were considered traitors) later led to massacres of Sinhalese and
Muslim civilians in the border villages and contested areas. By the 1980s, this phase in the evolution of
political violence expanded to include indiscriminate bomb attacks in the Sinhalese-dominated south,
particularly in Colombo. Subsequently, the conflict reached civil war proportions and Indian peacekeeping forces were sent to Sri Lanka in 1987. The Indian forces left in 1990 and the civil conflict
between the Government and LTTE resumed three months later. The conflict escalated in the late-1990s
with conventional battles being fought to capture territory.

Washington, D. C. 2043, USA

Sri Lanka: Public Information Notice
On September 3, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)concluded the
Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka'.
Background
Sri Lanka's economy grew steadily during the last two decades, despite the civil conflict, which has
been going on for over 9 years. During this period, financial markets were liberalized, the outward
orientation of the economy was significantly increased, and a more diversified export base
established. However, large fiscal imbalances (which averaged more than 9 percent of GDP during
this period) led to prolonged periods of public dissaving. Slow progress in key structural areas,
including civil service reform, restructuring of state-owned enterprises, financial and labor market
reforms, undermined the economy's growth potential.
Faced with low reserves, large import bills, and an exchange rate level and regime (a crawling band)
that was no longer credible, the authorities initiated a program of economic stabilization. The Central
Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) floated the exchange rate on January 23, 2001 and committed to an
ambitious stabilization program, supported by a Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved by the
Board on April 20, 2001. As envisaged, the current account deficit narrowed, and the CBSL
succeeded in building up net international reserves with a broadly stable exchange rate. At end-June
2001, the program had met all its key objectives. However, political developments complicated
economic policymaking during the second half of 2001. During this time, the government was not
able to take corrective policies to keep the program on track in the face of worsening circumstances.
GDP contracted by about 1% percent in 2001-the first contraction since independence in 1948. The
global recession led to stagnant demand overseas for garments and textiles-which account for half
of exports. Due to the drought, agricultural output declined more than 3 percent and low water
reservoir levels led to widespread power cuts. The attack on Colombo airport and the events of
September 11 also exacerbated the slowdown. While underlying inflation was close to the program
target of 8 percent (end-year basis) for 2001, drought-affected food prices drove up the headline rate.
The official Colombo Consumer Price Index (food items account for 65 percent of the CCPI basket)
increased 10%percent in the 12 months to December 2001.

I

Under Article IV of the IMFs Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On retum to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. The PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the September 3d Executive
Board discussion on the staff report.

Appendix II

Although, the external reserve losses of 2000 were partly reversed, balance of payments
developments in 2001 were weaker than programmed due to the external and domestic shocks and
delays in external financing. Private capital flows (including privatization receipts) fell below
expectations as structural reforms were delayed and investor confidence was undermined.
After a good start, the envisioned fiscal stabilization in 2001 did not materialize. In the second half of
the year, the slowing economy and a lack of resolve weakened the budget performance considerably.
Instead of declining as planned, the fiscal deficit rose in 2001 by 1 percentage point to almost 11
percent of GDP. Revenue suffered from slower growth, election-related tax cuts, and a lack of
progress on tax administration reform. On the expenditure side, despite tight controls on nonwage
recurrent spending, the authorities failed to tackle the politically sensitive spending on Samurdhi and
subsidies. Fiscal laxity intensified in the run-up to the December 2001 elections, with the granting of
large wage and pension increases. There was also an overrun in defense spending. The program
target on borrowing by public corporations was exceeded due to large losses by the Ceylon
Electricity Board (CEB).
Monetary policy was constrained by the fiscal situation, requiring high real interest rates to counter
exchange rate and inflationary pressures during most of 2000 and the early part of 2001. However,
the CBSL progressively reduced rates during the last three quarters of 2001 because of the weak
economy. By end-2001, the reverse rep0 rate was 900 basis points lower than its rate in January
2001. Despite the weak economy and the concomitant compression of credit to the private sector,
broad money growth slightly exceeded the 2001 target (13% percent) reflecting the increased public
sector borrowing requirement.
Following victory in the December elections, the United National Front (UNF) government
committed to deal with the major economic challenges it faced and move ahead with the program.
The new government presented a strong budget in March 2002, which demonstrated their
commitment to fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to lay the foundations for private sector
led growth in the medium-term.
Substantial progress was made on the macroeconomic stabilization front during the first half of 2002.
Inflation showed a trend decline-headline
inflation was in the range 8-9 percent for the 12 months
to August, consistent with the year end target. GDP growth bottomed out in the first quarter GDP.
The external position has stabilized and the rupee remained broadly stable, The CBSL continued to
maintain a broadly prudent monetary stance. Fiscal consolidation has began which is a key program
objective. The financial position of the public corporations also stabilized over January-June 2002.
In addition, major initiatives have been taken to resolve the civil conflict-a
permanent ceasefire is
in operation and peace talks are expected to commence in Thailand in September.

Economic Prospects2
Modest growth of 3%-4 percent is expected in 2002, reflecting in part the gradual pace of recovery in
external demand. With improved rainfall, early indications are that agricultural output will rebound
during the second half of 2002. Although some recovery is expected in both the garment and tea
sectors, which should boost manufacturing activity, significant turnaround in exports is not expected
2

more updated outlook provided in the main text.

Appendix II

until the latter part of 2002. Headline inflation through August indicates that the annual inflation
target of 7-8 percent is achievable. The CBSL continued to maintain a prudent monetary stance and
fiscal data through June suggest that the 8% percent deficit target is achievable. Nominal interest
rates are expected to decline during the second half of 2002 as inflation comes down and fiscal
consolidation takes hold and confidence begins to strengthen. The rupee, which is freely floating, has
remained stable in recent months. The trade deficit narrowed significantly during the first four
months of 2002 before increasing in May, and official reserves continued to rise steadily through
August. Preliminary data suggest that recent progress on the peace front has improved the outlook for
both portfolio and FDI flows. Thus, the external position is expected to strengthen, and gross official
reserves are projected to rise to $1% billion, about 2%months of imports of goods and services.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Sri Lanka is at a critical juncture-despite recent improvements, the
macroeconomic situation remains fragile, and achieving sustainable high growth requires major
adjustments. Directors also noted that resolution of the civil conflict and the scope for generating
growth opportunities are closely intertwined.
Directors welcomed the fact that the cease-fire is already providing an economic boost to the country
through lower security spending and renewed economic activity in the country’s conflict-affected
North and East. Sustained peace would allow budgetary resources to be reallocated to social
programs and building or rehabilitating infrastructure, especially in the war-tom parts of the country.
Directors welcomed that the government’s key macroeconomic objectives under the Stand-By
Arrangement had been achieved, with reserves being rebuilt and fiscal consolidation and several
structural reforms initiated, especially in the public sector. Nevertheless, Directors observed that the
government’s adjustment program has significant downside risks. In particular, there remain risks of
drought, and the long-term electricity shortages are still a major concern. Directors were also
concerned that any resumption of political uncertainties could slow down the peace momentum, and
undermine the fiscal position.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to press ahead with fiscal consolidation, which is
essential to ensuring fiscal and external sustainability over the medium term. They welcomed the
introduction of the new VAT, but stressed that the government should press on with other measures
to reform the tax system and administration. To contain current spending, the government should
also stand firm on its disciplined approach to wage and recruitment policies and defense spending. In
that connection, Directors welcomed the newly formed Defense Spending Monitoring Committee. In
addition, they urged the authorities to avoid having subsidies and transfers exceed the budget
provisions, and they should resist any further broad cost-of-living relief measures, including tax cuts
and administered price adjustments, that would undermine the financial viability of the budget or the
public corporations. If needed, the authorities should stand ready to take additional measures to
ensure that the broad fiscal goals are achieved.
Directors stressed that the 2003 budget will need to continue the path of fiscal consolidation, with the
focus on controlling current expenditures. They urged the authorities to extend the VAT to the retail
level and remove exemptions. The proposed unified revenue authority would likely soon contribute
to enhancing tax administration.

Appendix I1
Page 4 of 4

Directors considered that firm fiscal consolidation would enable the CBSL to maintain a prudent
monetary stance, while balancing the need to provide sufficient and affordable bank credit to the
private sector. While welcoming the gradual decline in policy interest rates this year, in line with the
path of inflation, Directors urged the CBSL to avoid further significant easing until it is clear that
fiscal consolidation has taken hold.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ current exchange rate policy and their commitment to improve the
functioning of the interbank foreign exchange market by implementing the Financial System
Stability Assessment (FSSA) recommendations. They agreed that CBSL’s intervention should
continue to aim primarily at realizing the net foreign asset path of the monetary program, with only
limited smoothing of short-term exchange rate volatility.
Directors emphasized the need to strengthen the banking system, which, together with a stable
macroeconomic environment, would provide a stronger basis for a gradual and sequenced form of
capital account liberalization. They called for further strengthening of the CBSL’s supervisory
function. They welcomed the authorities’ decision to tackle the problems of Peoples Bank and to
improve the performance of the Bank of Ceylon, with the help of technical assistance from the Fund
and the World Bank. The authorities were encouraged to finalize the draft law on anti-money
laundering, in the light of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission’s
recommendations.
Looking ahead, Directors noted that a major challenge for the authorities is to press ahead with
deeper structural refom measures to promote growth and reduce poverty. They endorsed the
authorities’ structural reform agenda, and were encouraged by the initial steps taken on the structural
front. The measures to restructure the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the Ceylon
Electricity Board (CEB), and to invite private participation in those companies under an appropriate
regulatory framework, were welcomed. More ambitious privatization was recommended, which
could provide resources for government debt reduction, and contribute to long-term economic growth
and private sector development. Over the medium term, further reform of public expenditure and the
financial sector, restructuring of public sector institutions, strengthening the tax collection agencies,
and labor market reforms would serve to improve public sector effectiveness and promote private
sector growth.
Directors noted that data quality and timeliness are satisfactory for surveillance. They looked forward
to Sri Lanka soon subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

CAS Completion Report
Country: Sri Lanka
Date of CAS: May 21, 1996

Date of Progress Report: December 23, 1998

Period covered by the CAS Completion Report: July 1996-December 2002
CAS Completion Report completed by: Deborah Bateman, Country Coordinator for Sri Lanka
Date: December 6, 2002

A.

Country Development Results

At the time the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was written in 1996, the most important
country development results which the CAS were aligned with included: (i) reducing poverty, especially
in rural areas; (ii) improving the quality of education and health services; (iii) obtaining higher and steady
growth rates; and (iv) reducing unemployment (see Table 1). Although the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) are a much more recent concept, a number of the development results with which the CAS
was aligned-specifically, reducing poverty, improving the quality of education and health services and
reducing unemployment-are directly related to the MDGs. However, it is important to note that at the
time the CAS was written, Sri Lanka’s impressive social achievements-i.e., low infant mortality;
virtually universal primary school enrollment, with enrollment rates for girls comparable to those for boys
throughout the system; and gender disparities in wage levels among the lowest in the world-set it apart
from most low and middle income economies.
While it appears that some progress has been made in achieving the country development results,
in many areas it is difficult to measure progress given a lack of data and clear indicators. Initially growth
rates improved slightly, but due to the sharp downturn in 2001-in which negative GDP growth was
recorded for the first time since Independence-Sri Lanka is far from achieving the higher, steady growth
rate that it desires. Furthermore, while unemployment has also declined during the period, it still remains
high and identifying new sources of employment remains a chief concern.

B.

CAS Outcomes the Bank Expected to Influence through its Interventions

The specific CAS outcomes focused on key areas required to help Sri Lanka realize its dream of
economic growth and poverty reduction comparable to that of its more prosperous East Asian neighbors.
CAS benchmarks were established in the areas of: (i) improving fiscal discipline/ensuring sustainable
macroeconomic balances; (ii) developing/promoting the private sector; (iii) enhancing social protection/
building human capital; and (v) improving portfolio performance. There are a number of direct links
between these and the country development results+.g., improving/promoting the private sector is
directly related to obtaining higher and steady growth rates and reducing unemployment. However, many
of the linkages are more indirect--e.g., improving fiscal discipline and enhancing social protection are
indirectly linked with improving the quality of education and health.
There has been considerable progress on meeting many of the CAS outcomes (see Table l),
although much of the progress has been quite recent and as a result, the remaining agenda is substantial.
Specifically:

Appendix 111
Page 2 of 15

Improving fiscal discipline/ensuring sustainable macroeconomic balancenthere have
been periods of weak fiscal discipline during the period-in part associated with the almost
annual pre-election “hand-outs.” Nevertheless, the previous administration did make some
notable progress-including entering into a Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF in April
200 1-and the current administration (elected in December 200 1) is continuing with serious steps
towards fiscal consolidation. With regard to specific targets, initially the overall budget deficit
declined, but starting in 2000, weakening revenue performance and increasing expenditures
(many related to the security situation and the large debt burden) have resulted in relatively high
deficits. The current commitment to ensuring macroeconomic stability and institutionalizing
fiscal discipline is strong, but in a peace scenario with large reconstruction needs, there is a
possibility that high deficits could remain in the coming years. On the issue of subsidies, there
has been good progress-even prior to 2002-with many large subsidies removed and the few
that remain are more limited and closely monitored. With regard to the tax system, there have
been impressive gains with the introduction of a goods and services tax (GST), which more
recently (August 2002) has been replaced by a VAT.
DeveIoping/promoting the private sector-there has been significant progress over the
period on number of fronts. With regard to privatization, there was progress early on with the
successful privatization of the plantations (1996) and the national telecommunications company
(SLT). Following this, there was little action for a number of years, due in part to frequent
elections that slowed the momentum for structural reforms. Nevertheless, 2002 has seen a burst
of activity, including the privatization of two sugar companies and Lanka Marine, along with
progress toward unbundling the electricity company (CEB) and plans to place additional shares of
SLT on the stock exchange. With regard to People’s Bank, the Government is exploring a
number of options (developed with lMFA3ank assistance) and will announce its plans in mid2003. Furthermore, early in the period there were some reductions in Government interference in
the domestic agricultural market-including closing the Paddy Marketing Board. More recently,
there has been an acceleration of implementation of the pilot land titling program, but, as
identified in a recent Bank Report (“Sri Lanka: Promoting Agricultural and Rural Non-farm
Sector Growth”), improvements in agricultural productivity growth are still restricted by
extensive Government interventions in agricultural commodity and factor markets.
Enhancing social protectionhuilding human capital-Progress was fairly limited during
the initial years of the CAS period, with a lot of talk about reforming Samurdhi, but little action,
with the exception of annual real reductions in budget allocations to Samurdhi since 2001. In
recent months, the Government has passed a new Welfare Benefits Act that provides a legal
framework for all welfare relief benefits financed by the Treasury. This act sets out transparent
processes and guidelines dictating how all social transfer programs will be carried out, along with
giving the Ministry of Finance a key role in the implementation of all schemes. Hence, targeting,
efficiency and effectiveness of such programs will likely improve. Over the last two years, there
have been positive outcomes in the area of teacher re-deployment with evidence now that all
provinces are continuing to make steady progress on deploying teachers to difficult areas.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to assess whether or not there has been real progress in building
human capital.
Project implementation-while the disbursement ratio declined for the most part during the
period, it improved slightly in FYOl and substantially (to 25%) in FY02. In part, this is due to
the strong commitment that the new Government has shown to improving project
implementation, including the establishment of a cabinet subcommittee to focus on this area.

Appendix III
Page 3 of 15

Nevertheless, a number of important generic issues-including weak project management, slow
procurement decisions and frequent changes in project personnel-persist and need to be tackled.
As mentioned above and shown in Table 1, many of the CAS outcomes can be quantified and
provided a general basis for measuring progress. However, it has been difficult to measure whether or not
there has been progress with regard to the human capital development efforts.
A number of factors-including the prolonged internal ethnic crisis, continuing political
instability and the external environment (e.g., the repercussions of September 1l*)-have contributed to
the limited achievement of the CAS outcomes. Specifically, all these factors had considerable impacts on
economic growth, both directly through declines in important activities such as tourism and exports, and
indirectly on development of the private sector due to uncertainty and lack of demand. Furthermore,
despite some successes in structural reforms, on more than one occasion during the period, increases in
political instability were directly linked with slowdowns/stalls in the pace of reform implementation, as
Government became preoccupied with politics and ownership of reform efforts weakened.
There have not been any unintended negative impacts-such as unintended social costs or
environmental damage, etc.-as a result of the implementation of the CAS.

C.

Measuring Bank Performance'

Throughout the period, the assessment of quality at entry has been impressive with ratings of
100% being maintained (see Table 1). The quality of supervision has been rated as relatively high,
although declined slightly in recent years. The assessment of quality of ESW has been very limited with
two of the three pieces-the Urban Transport Strategy Note and the Poverty and Social Development
work-evaluated as marginal'. Similarly, evaluations of achievement of development objectives and
sustainability of results have been fairly poor and not improving through the period.
With regard to program delivery, under the CAS base case scenario it was anticipated that lending
volumes would be in the range of US$70-140 milliodyear. Alternatively, the low case scenarienvisioned in the event of a failure to stem the current fiscal deterioration or if the structural reforms
entirely stalled or reversed--carried with it a lending program of about one or two operations a year, for
an average annual total of about US$50 million. During the period FY97-FY02, twelve IDA credits were
approved for a total of approximately US370 million (see Table 2-r
an annual average of two
projects per year for US$62 million. As such, while performance supported a base case lending program
for a short sub-period (Le., in 1997 and 1998 following the initiation of policy reforms), for the remainder
of the period-as the Government became preoccupied with the elections, the conflict escalated and
reform efforts weakened-performance was judged to be less than that required to operate under the base
case scenario. This was appropriately borne out in the Bank's lending volumes. Nevertheless, throughout
I

A serious lack of availability of reliable data for the purposes of the evaluations in this section should be noted. As
many of the Bank's systems-including SAP and Business Warehouse-were only being developed during the CAS
implementation period, consistent historical data series are lacking for most variables. Furthermore, routine tracking of
quality and performance-by QAG and OED-were only being developed during the period and the small samples for
these indicators may be very misleading. While this discussion is based on the best available data, the scope for
inaccuracy and drawing of wrong conclusions should be noted.

In the case of the Urban Transport Strategy Note, the major faults cited included a lack of clarity of the task and limited
dialogue and dissemination. It should be noted that this was always intended to be a small piece of work (Le., less than
US$50,000) and for an internal Bank audience-both of which the QAG team did not accept. In the case of the
Poverty and Social Development work, again the clarity of the task objectives were questioned, as were its cost and
audience.

the period, a strong AAA (Analytical and Advisory Activities) program was carried out, with an average
of 4-5 activities per year (see Table 3). Key reports included Annual Economic Updates, a Poverty
Assessment, assistance in carrying out the “RRR Framework3, an Agricultural Policy Review and a
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
With regard to portfolio performance, the number of (IDA) projects declined steadily from 19 in
FY96 to 10 in FY99, before increasing to 12 in FYOO where it has since remained. This decline was
accompanied by a decline in the average implementation period-from 4.4 years in FY96 to 2.4 years in
FY99-and at the same time, a decline in the disbursement ratio-from 24% in FY96 to 15% in FYOO.
Since then, there has been a substantial increase in the disbursement ratio-to 25% in FY02-as the
portfolio matured. Prior to the CAS, portfolio performance experienced a sharp turn around in FY95,
following a major restructuring effort after successive years of decline. Throughout the period, both the
percent of projects at risk by number and the percent of problem projects by number stayed below 20%,
with the exception of FY99 when it increased to 30%. The two current problem projects-Mahaweli and
PSIDC-are
experiencing many of the generic issues previously identified, including weak
regulatory/policy environment, lack of ownership and political will to implement reform measures and
weak project management. Nevertheless, in November 2002, a portfolio restructuring-primarily of
these two projects-was undertaken to provide urgently needed support to the conflict-affected North
East.

D.

Consultation and Coordination

During the period, aid coordination has been an important component of the Bank’s strategy and
efforts have been quite successful. Until assumed by the Government in June 2002, the Bank had chaired
the aid coordination meetings-Le., Development Forums-held approximately every 18 months. At the
same time, an active donor coordination forum in Colombo has been developed and meets regularly under
the leadership of a chairman that has rotated between the Bank, ADB and UNDP. As Japan (JBIC), the
ADB and IDA account for about 90 percent of concessional assistance, the Bank has also made efforts to
coordinate at the country strategy and sector level with these large donors. While this has resulted in
some successes-such as the joint CAS consultations carried out in FYOl and the more recent rapid needs
assessments in the North East-there is still considerable room for progress, especially with convergence
on the need to link lending decisions to outcomes and implementation of programdresults. This is a
process that will need to be further strengthened and the efforts towards reconstruction in the North East
pose a tremendous opportunity for further improvements and solidifying a “best practice” donor
coordination model. Furthermore, Government leadership of the coordination of development partners
leaves much to be desired. The Bank, along with the ADB, is working on trying to improve this.
PHRD and GEF have been the major sources of trust fundgrant resources mobilized in support of
the CAS implementation. Disbursements from these sources ranged between US$2 million and US$4
million during the period FY99 to FY02 with a shift taking place from Bank to country execution. GEF
funding for two projects-Energy
Services Delivery and Medicinal PlantsAominate these
disbursements, complemented by PHRD grants for project preparation and an IDF grant to support
improvements in urban air and fuel quality.
When the CAS was developed in 1996, there were broad consultations with various stakeholders,
including the Government. However, compared to today’s standards, the consultations were relatively
3

The Relief, Rehabilitation, and Reconciliation (RRR) Framework was an important consultative process that brought
together Govemment, civil society, individuals and communities to identify ways to work together to improve relief,
rehabilitation and reconciliation efforts in the context of the civil conflict. The Bank assisted the Government in
launching this process and provided strong support until the Government completely took over in early-2002.

Appendix I l l

limited. In FYO1, a substantial CAS consultation process was carried out4-by the Bank and joined by
ADB and JBIC-to gain a better understanding of the development challenges and priorities facing Sri
Lanka. The team consulted with a wide range of civil society groups, including teachers, students,
religious leaders, trade unions, political party leaders, members of the international donor community,
journalists, professionals, young entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), national and
provincial chambers of commerce, fishermen, villagers, plantation workers, and national and local
Government officials. Although the views of stakeholder groups diverged, there was strong consensus on
several key priorities. The cross-cutting concerns raised during the consultations include: (i) the
deterioration of governance in the country; (ii) the effects of the civil conflict; (iii) the absence of
empowerment and opportunities for the poor; (iv) the need for reforms in education, notably the provision
of education in English; and (iv) the role of donors. Prior to this, the Bank had assisted andor
participated in other important consultation processes carried out by the Government for the development
of the RRR Framework and the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).

E.

Lessons Learned for Subsequent CAS Design

While the country development results supported by the Bank during the CAS period were quite
broad and generic, they were likely the correct ones. In that the CAS was undertaken before MDGs when
many of the Bank’s clients had yet to define clear and specific development results, the lack of
clarity/specificity in the country development results have made evaluation of the country and the CAS
performance somewhat more difficult. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned Sri Lanka is in a fairly
unique position, having achieved human development outcomes as great as those of high-income
countries and surpassing almost all of the MDGs at an early stage of its development process.
Overall, the CAS outcomes achieved during the period are sustainable. While in many cases
progress was relatively modest and prolonged in being achieved, there appears to be a clear and
irreversible reform process set in motion. For example, the need for fiscal consolidation is clearly
accepted today and an important part of the country’s strategy. Furthermore, there is well-recognized
need to remove the distortions hindering private sector development and reform the enabling business
environment. Prior to the CAS, recognition of the need for these types of reforms-at least across the
political spectrum-were not so widespread. Nevertheless, considerable public awarenesddissemination
is still required to education the general population on the justification and benefits of such reforms.
An important factor that contributed towards achievement of the CAS program was strengthening
of the Colombo office, including moving the Country Director to Colombo in 1997 and building a local
capacity to support the economic/policy dialogues and project implementation. In addition, the strong
presence in Colombo allowed the Bank to: (i) work successfully in fosteringlfacilitatingthe early conflictrelated activities-Le., the RRR framework; (ii) gain experience in implementing community-driven
demand (CDD) approaches in both conflict-affected and other areas through the North East Irrigated
Agriculture Project (NEIAP) and the Village Self Help Initiative; and (iii) react quickly-through
portfolio restructuring to support an emergency program for the North East-when the conditions for
peace turned favorable. Bank support to the Central Bank (through the Central Bank Strengthening
Credit) also worked well by demonstrating that quick reaction to a reform-minded champion can foster
reform efforts and begin to chip away at governance issues.
Major factors contributing to a lack of real progress toward implementing the CAS program were
political instability and lack of ownership, which often resulted in complex projects that suffered from
4

It was intended that a CAS for Sri Lanka be presented to the Board in late-FYOl/early-FY02. Due to heightened
political instability at that time, along with a severe worsening in the domestic security situation, it was assessed that it
was an inappropriate time to present a new CAS.

Appendix Ill
Page 6 of 15

weak implementation. These are being taken forward in the design of the next CAS in a number of ways,
including:
adopting a more realistic approach to the issues of political instability and ownership,
specifically by focusing more on: (i) AAA and policy dialogue before jumping prematurely into
project preparation; (ii) supporting specific, opportunistic reforms put forward by serious
champions with demonstrated implementation ability; and (iii) capacity building;
placing greater emphasis on project implementation. In the past, project preparation has
often taken more than three years and consumed a substantial share of the administrative budget,
thereby leaving limited resources for implementation efforts. In the future, project preparation
will be shortened, and greater resources will be allocated for implementation efforts;
developing simpler, yet larger projects supporting either CDD approaches or comprehensive
sectoral/multi-sectoral efforts; and
being more selective and focused on areas in which we choose to engage, in addition to
shifting towards greater use of programmatic/adjustment lending.
There are a number of analytical gaps which need to be addressed in the next CAS, specifically:
given the current continuing fragile fiscal situation-including the effects of the large public
debt burden-public expenditure analysis will need to become a permanent core activity and
work has already been initiated in this regard;
as governance remains a fundamental challenge, completing the Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) and Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) will be
essential for setting a strong foundation for the shift toward a more programmatic lending
approach and uncovering other important issues for potential future AAA;
given the “opening-up” of the North East-in
which currently all (including the
Government) have a substantial knowledge void-key pieces of ESW are needed, comprising a
Poverty Assessment (including updating the situation for the entire country) and a Social
Assessment of Conflict-Affected Areas;
to better understand the reform challenges, it will be important to carry out a Development
Policy Review (DPR), with a particular focus on future sources of growth;
0
given that the private sector will need to play an enhanced role in generating future
economic growth, an Investment Climate Survey-for both urban and rural areas-will need to
be undertaken;

given the urgent need to show real improvements in the quality of human development, it
will be important to analyze carefully the issues in both the health and education sectors and
assist the Government in developing appropriate strategies; and
0

an effective monitoring and evaluation system is critical for tracking implementation of the
country development results and CAS outcomes. Given the current institutional weaknesses in
this area, there is much to be done with regard to strengthening data collection, analysis and its
linkages with policy and the monitoring of inputs, outputs and outcomes.
0

In recent years, between specific consultations carried out by the Bank-including for the CASand consultations carried out by the Government with Bank involvement-such as for the RRR
Framework and the PRS-there is a bit of “consultation fatigue” within Sri Lanka. Therefore, it will be

Appendix I l l
Page 7 of 15

important to be more selective in carrying out further consultations and Bank efforts in this area need to
take a backseat to Government efforts. Nevertheless, in developing more projects that use communitydriven demand approaches, strong emphasis will be placed on consultations during project preparation
and implementation. With regard to a related issue-i.e., a relatively poor image of the Bank within Sri
Lanka-we will be more proactive in our external relations efforts, including focusing on disseminating
information about the Bank’s activities in all native languages and supporting the Government in its
public awareness campaigns surrounding the reform efforts. It is envisioned that important lessons will
be learned from these activities to fine-tune the CAS during the implementation period.
Similar lessons were highlighted in the Country Assistance Note (CAN) carried out by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in December 1998; specifically:
The physical components of projects-while implemented well-were
implementation delays, due primarily to procurement problems;
0

subject to increasing

Policy changes and institutional reforms were difficult to achieve; therefore, the Bank’s
assistance should have been more sensitive to the political cycle and substantial preparation and
consultation with stakeholders;
0
The Bank did not give adequate attention to the possible divisive impact of its programse.g., several large education projects could have had greater value if they had fostered the role of
education in promoting social inclusion in a more prominent manner; and

0
Although the Bank’s analysis and advice were sound and its strategic objectives were wellaligned with Government’s, only limited institutional framework changes were made.

Appendix IV
Summary of CAS Consultations

I

Consultation Process
The Bank carried out extensive consultations for the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) during
June-November, 2000 in order to benefit from various stakeholder groups’ knowledge and ideas, as well
as gain a better understanding of the development challenges and priorities facing the people of Sri
Lanka’. Given the strong presence of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japanese Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC) in Sri Lanka, these two organizations ’were invited to participate in the
consultation process. The Bank/ADB/JBIC team consulted with a wide range of civil society groups,
including teachers, students, religious leaders, trade unions, political party leaders, members of the
international donor community, journalists, professionals, young entrepreneurs, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), chambers of commerce at both the national and provincial levels, fishermen,
villagers, plantation workers, and government officials at both the national and local levels. Detailed
summaries of individual consultation meetings were prepared and sent to the participants for their
comments and subsequent endorsement for wider distribution. Two documents containing these
summaries of the meetings (“Summaries of the First Round Consultations for the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) of the World Bank, Colombo Sri Lanka June-July 2000” and “Summaries of the Second
Round Consultations for the CAS of the World Bank, Sri Lanka November 2000”) were prepared and
widely disseminated within the country and the Bank. More recently, small meetings have been held with
various stakeholder groups-primarily in Government, the international donor community, professionals,
chambers of commerce and with various groups in the North East-to validate the observations of the
previous consultations. For the most part the earlier observations remain valid, however, given the
current prospects for peace and the poor economic performance during 2001, in the more recent
consultations substantially more emphasis has been placed on the need for finding a lasting solution to the
conflict and improving opportunities for the population, especially for the poor

Main Messages
The insights provided by the consultations have been valuable in formulating the Bank’s future
role and assistance strategy for Sri Lanka. While there were often diverging views among and between
stakeholder groups, there was also strong consensus on several key priorities issues. The cross-cutting
priority concerns raised during the consultations include the: (i) deterioration of governance in the
country; (ii) impacts of the civil conflict; (iii) lack of empowerment and opportunities for the poor; (iv)
need for reforms in education, most notably provision of education in English; and (iv) role of donors.
Some illustrative quotations and highlights from the consultations are presented below. It should be
stressed that the views and comments expressed in this Annex are not those of the World Bank, but have
been expressed by various stakeholders during the consultation process.

*

Deterioration in governance

“We always talk to the World Bank, JBIC, ADB, and others and keep repeating the same things, but
donors are not in a position to help with the biggest problem in Sri Lanka-the absence of good
governance. The rule of law and due process must prevail. ’’
I

It was intended that a CAS for Sri Lanka be presented to the Board in late-FYOl/early-FY02. Due to heightened
political instability at that time, along with a worsening in the domestic security situation, it was decided that it was
inappropriate to present a new CAS at that time.

Appendix IV

Page 2 of 4

L6Governanceis the biggest issue. There is no participatory democracy in Sri Lanka. Politicians are not
answerable to people after they are elected.”
“National development has to be government-owned and an inclusive process. It may not be the best, but
is better than other strategies since it is government-driven. An example is the Poverty Framework
prepared by the Government of Sri Lanka.”
The deterioration of governance in Sri Lanka was overwhelmingly identified in the consultations
as one of the highest concerns. In general, there is the feeling that policy and political debates center not
around poverty reduction or the problems facing the poor, but on vested interests. Stakeholders expressed
the view that Government decision-making has been driven by short-term political considerations, and
there is little evidence of long term planning. Furthermore, it is felt that there is a lack of accountability
in the public sector. For instance, the Public Accounts Commission of the Western Provincial Council is
still reviewing the financial statements and audit queries for 1995. Statements for subsequent years have
not yet been prepared, and no one has been held accountable for this lapse. There is the view that while
high standards were maintained in the civil service in the 1960s, there has been a gradual erosion over
time. The abolishment of the Public Service Commission in 1972 was identified by many as the
beginning of pervasive politicization of government recruitment and the deterioration in governance. It
was felt that an independent Public Service Commission, Police Commission and Election Commission,
if established with proper guidelines and incentives, would help improve accountability in the public
sector.

*

Poverty, conflict and social divisions

“ l f a small fraction of what is being spent on the war would have been spent on the development of Sri
Lanka, we would have seen a much greater reduction of poverty.”
“Despite several constraints, the country has managed to continue a reform process. I f not for the war,
the benefits of the reform process would be great.”
“Development should not only be in Colombo!”
There is consensus that the quality of life in Sri Lanka is higher than in other South Asian
developing countries. Nevertheless, the war has prevented the country from fully capitalizing on its high
social indicators, and generous levels of foreign assistance. The detrimental effects of the conflict are far
more widespread than just the North East. For example, the livelihood of fishermen is constrained by
curfews imposed due to security concerns; foreign investment has been restrained by the pervasive
uncertainty and insecurity; and inflation has been rising with the government having to increase
administrative prices and taxes to finance military expenditures.
People see the end to the civil conflict as a political solution. A commonly shared opinion is that
the conflict has become a business in Sri Lanka with widespread allegations of corruption in the “war
business.” As one child in the consultations put it, successive governments have utilized the war to their
advantage as a kind of “wound on a beggar’s leg” to justify soliciting foreign aid-Le., many felt that the
war has been used as an excuse for poor governance in the country. The view was also expressed that the
conflict is a convenient justification to delay reforms and development. Many attribute the origins of the
conflict to divisive policies/politics. The country has been divided along ethnicity, religion, politics and
geography. Disparities among these divided groups have caused frustration. For instance, the division of
the country between Colombo and the rest of the island in terms of level of public expenditures,
employment and economic growth with industries concentrated in the Western Province (because of good

Appetzdrx I V
Page 3 of 4

infrastructure) was mentioned repeatedly as a concern by government officials and the segments of civil
society consulted outside Colombo.

*

Lack of empowerment and opportunities for the poor

“Give them (the poor) opportunities.. .. not handouts. ”
“We are not a poor country, but there are many poor people.”

The view that development needs to be “people-centered” was often voiced. It was felt that
people must be empowered in making decisions that affect their lives. Often the beneficiaries were not
even consulted as to what they need and what they feel is needed to improve their lives. However, many
did comment on the successes in public programs/policies based on inclusion and consultations (e.g.,
privatization of plantations) and the fact that voter turnout during elections is high. There was a sense of
frustration regarding inadequate social debate on important issues in Sri Lanka, despite the country’s long
legacy of literacy.
Another commonly expressed sentiment was that the country’s development is leaving the poor
behind. A number of important facets were noted; specifically that: (i) the poor need access to markets
and information; (ii) there is a lack of good roads and the transport networks restrict the mobility and
access of people from remote villages. This in turn results in middle men exploiting poorer farmers and
depressing producer prices, which keep families in these remote villages in poverty; (iii) young women
from remote villages are at times left with no other option but to work in estates outside their villages or
as domestic workers in the Middle East, because there are no jobs available in their own localities; (iv)
there are few, if any, training opportunities for the poor; and (v) Sri Lankans have a lot of potential, but
there are often very limited avenues available to utilize their capacities.
A view was expressed that the poorest of the poor are often difficult to target. For instance, when
midwives visit a community, the poor are generally not present since they are often away trying to make
ends meet. Furthermore, it was felt that: (i) children of poor families are unlikely to be immunized since
they frequently do not have birth certificates; (ii) social security programs are usually so complex that the
poor are unable to participate in them; (iii) very few services are provided to abused and institutionalized
children (including orphans and abandoned children) with psychologistlpsychiatrists in short supply in the
country; and (iv) mainstreaming these children into society is a major issue when they leave institutions at
age 18 without adequate life skills.

*

Reforming education

“Sri Lanka created human capital, but a stifling environment.’’
“There is literacy, but there is very little education.”
“There is a mismatch between education and market needs. The education system has failed to improve
despite ad hoc changes. Education is insulated from the market. ’’

The need for education reforms was another cross-cutting challenge identified. The key themes
included: (i) the lack of English and computer science education in most rural areas which handicap the
poor; (ii) a disconnect between the education system and the needs of the economy; (iii) English and
computer skills-while vital for the job market-are often not effectively taught in schools; and (iv) over
90 percent of the population is said to be literate, but much of this is either in Sinhalese or Tamil.

Appendix 1V
Page 4 of 4

Many expressed the view that the medium of instruction in schools should be English, as
proficiency in English will widen the economic opportunities for young graduates and can also be used as
a link language to promote social harmony in the country. For example, all students in one meeting in
Galle unanimously raised their hands when asked who wanted to learn in English. The students clearly
understood that they were at a disadvantage if they are not conversant in English. The education system
is currently segregated by medium of instruction (Sinhalese or Tamil), which makes it difficult to foster
social harmony.

*

Donors share part of the blame, but they can also be part of the solution

“One has to ask ifgovemment has made the best use offunds from donors.”
“They (Government) know donor money will continue to come in, so they don’t need to change. ”
“There had never been consultations with NGOs (non-governmental organizations)for the CAS process
before.”

Foreign donors have played an important role in Sri Lanka in the past, but it is felt that foreign
agencies may have also compounded Sri Lanka’s problems by continuing to provide assistance without
questioning the adequacy of policies and rationale for projects. Some groups expressed concerns about
the fungibility of aid to a country in conflict. It was also felt that monitoring and evaluation of donor
programs must improve to maximize the developmental impact of aid and that many donor projects need
to do better to reach the grassroots level.
Some of the advice offered by the stakeholders on how the Bank can improve the effectiveness of
aid to Sri Lanka included: (i) the need for better public dissemination of information regarding Bank
projects and activities in the country; (ii) inclusion of people at the grassroots level in monitoring and
evaluating Bank-funded projects; and (iii) the need for the Bank to continue policy dialogue with the
government and make an effort to influence the government to end the war.

Appendix V
The Main Findings of Two Key Fiduciary Assessments:
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)
and the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR)

A.

The Country Financial Accountability Assessment’

Context
The framework for public financial accountability in Sri Lanka is founded in the principles of
governance associated with the Westminster model inherited from the British. This framework is widely
accepted as appropriate for the country. The primary accountability institutions and organizations for
financial management, control, audit and legislative scrutiny have, however, not evolved in line with the
changes in the more advanced democracies of a similar background. This lapse has reduced the
effectiveness of the system of public financial accountability in Sri Lanka, resulting in less than adequate
assurance that public funds are used for the purposes intended with due consideration to economy and
efficiency.
Financial accountability at the sub-national level is less well-developed than at the center. The
reasons for this are similar to those concerning the central government, but more acute and pronounced.
For example, control over funds is subject to less public scrutiny and financial reporting is less regular. In
addition, provincial and local governments’ dependency on the central government for funds and
confusion over the role of the center vis-his that of the provinces, result in excessive duplication of
effort and resources. As regards public corporations, there are over 180 state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
which combine commercial and regulatory activities in Sri Lanka. The majority of these are
characterized by excessive staff; weak management; inefficiencies; heavy losses; dependency on budget
transfers; and delayed publication of audited accounts, thus, further eroding public financial
accountability.

Key Findings
The will to reform is evident at both the political and bureaucratic levels. Confirming the
willingness to move ahead with much needed reforms are several recent initiatives jointly taken by the
government, legislators, and the Auditor General (AG) for improving accountability of key SOEs,
including: (i) strengthening the reporting requirements of government agencies; (ii) drafting of new
legislations, setting up organizational arrangements for improved oversight by the Treasury of state
owned enterprises; and (iii) the ‘e-Sri lanka’ initiative for implementing the e-governance concept.
Discussions with stakeholders on reforms centered around the urgent need to arrest further
deterioration in public financial accountability. Five priority areas of concern were identified:
Parliamentary control of the public purse has become ineffective and does not currently meet the
expectations set in the Constitution. This can be restored by strengthening the oversight function
provided by the public accounts and public enterprises committees (COPA and COPE) and
I

The CFAA was undertaken from February to October 2002 by a team comprised of Bank staff, govemment
counterparts and consultants. The work was carried out through a combination of field studies in specific areas,
reviews of existing studies and self-assessments. In addition, there was extensive discussioddialogue with concemed
stakeholders in the govemment, private sector, legislature, media, civil society and donors.

establishing a standing committee to focus on the annual budget. The recent initiative taken by
the COPE to probe into the performance of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is noteworthy in
this regard.
The accountability of the executive at present is too focused on ‘spending to budget’, rather than
on ‘managing for results’. This shift in focus, widely considered to be important, can be
accomplished by introducing, on a progressive basis, a performance-based culture with incentives
that reward achievement of outputs and outcomes, and holding the secretaries of government to
account for meeting departmental objectives and performance standards. In this context, recent
efforts taken to base the year 2003 budget on a Medium Term Budget Framework (MTBF) is
notable. It will be equally important to reduce the emphasis on concern with administrative
processes and mere compliance with detailed rules and regulations. The government’s move
towards establishing a separate revenue agency is a good example of re-thinking on these lines.
At the same time, it will be necessary to clarify the accountability relationship of the secretary of
each department to hisher minister. The government has received advice on the issue of
ministerial accountability from the Netherlands Court of Audit.
The public audit function does not currently meet the standards implied in Article 153 of the
Constitution and those expected of the auditing profession, and consequently, its impact on
financial accountability is below its potential. This can be strengthened by making the Auditor
General more independent of the executive and by building capacity to provide more relevant
audit information to parliament. A preliminary study carried out by the Netherlands Court of
Audit has endorsed the need for strengthening this institution. Recent initiatives of the Auditor
General to improve the timeliness of audit reports is a significant step in this direction.
The culture of governance that derives from colonial times is not appropriate to the present needs
and the government has expressed its intention to move towards a more open, participative form
of governance and decision-making. This can be accomplished by removing obstacles, such as
the Official Secrets Act, and re-visiting the Establishment Codes to bring government in line with
evolving good practices in other parts of the world.
The lack of clarity over the accountability relationships of the central, provincial and local
governments and financial reporting arrangements not being well-aligned to the needs of a more
devolved system of governance, weaken accountability at the sub-national levels. The efforts
underway to address this issue should include greater specificity on financial accounting,
reporting, auditing, and public scrutiny arrangements and capacity building at the sub-national
levels.
To address the above concerns, the government intends to move forward on two broad fronts: (i)
enacting new legislation and rules to address institutional issues; and (ii) carry out capacity
buildindtraining, for improving organizational efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically:

Institutional Reforms
Amend the standing orders and the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act, which govern the
rules of procedures of parliament, to allow for greater public access to the hearings of the COPA
and COPE and for opportunities for these committees to further explore ways to enhance
government productivity, over and above scrutiny based on audit information.
Enact the proposed Public Finance draft legislation after due consultation with stakeholders and
review of recent similar legislations enacted in other countries, for financial management of the
government of Sri Lanka, the establishment and maintenance of the accounts of the State, and the
control of public sector enterprises. Such legislation would have greater authority than the

Appendix V
Page 3 of 10

existing financial regulations promulgated by the government, and consequently provide a firmer
basis for more effective enforcement. At the same time, this should clarify the financial
accountability of the minister as distinct from the secretary of the ministry.
Enact dedicated audit legislation that specifies the duties, powers and responsibilities of the AG
and provides safeguards for his financial and administrative independence from the executive.
The Act should also provide for unrestricted access by the AG to information, property and
personnel associated with management of all significant public resources.
Pass the proposed Freedom of Information bill, after due consultation with stakeholders, to allow
for greater public access to information in line with the principles of more accountable and open
system of governance.
Develop the form and content of the financial accounts of the various levels of government, and
common reporting standards consistent with international public sector accounting standards.

Capacity Building
Build awareness, information sharing, and research capacity of the two oversight committees and
the proposed new standing committee on the budget in the legislature.

Strengthen the management control practices associated with revenue, expenditure, assets and
liabilities of the government. This work would complement initiatives currently being covered by
the Public Expenditure Management Systems Project (funded by ADB) would include
simplification of Financial Regulations (FRs), modernization of accounting and financial
reporting in conformity with international public sector professional standards, and performance
reporting in line with the evolution in more advanced democracies.
Formulate an Institutional Development Plan for strengthening the AG’s Department. This
would entail changes to the audit work program, methodology and the organizational structure,
and, most importantly, a human resources strategy, including recruitment policy, compensation
packages, training, and career development opportunities.
Implement the proposed legislation on Freedom of Information through the development of
policies, procedures, and training of personnel involved with the provision of timely and
appropriate information to the public.
Set accounting and financial reporting standards in line with international public sector
accounting standards, and develop policies and practices for the preparation and dissemination of
financial information, including by means of information technology under the e-governance
initiative.

The assessment concluded that there are substantial opportunities for introducing institutional
reforms for strengthening public financial accountability in Sri Lanka. There is every indication that the
political will for reforms will be sustained. The government seeks a time-bound action plan for moving
forward on each of the areas of reform and capacity building as outlined above. The Bank, in partnership
with other development agencies, will support initiatives aimed at developing the action plan and provide
technical assistance for implementing the recommendations of this assessment.

The Country Procurement Assessment Review2

Context
Per capita employment in the public sector in Sri Lanka is the largest in Asia and provides
employment for more than 850,000 people. In addition to ministries and departments, Sri Lanka has
over 150 Statutory Boards, Public Corporations and Public Enterprises, which combine commercial and
regulatory activities. Public sector contribution to GDP is 12.3%;the fiscal situation is dominated by
defense and interest payments (56%) and public debt is 97.1% of GDP (2000). Furthermore, public
accountability systems, processes and institutions are weak, outdated and not sufficiently independent.
The volume of public procurement in Sri Lanka is about Rs.70 billion, with about 65 billion in US$.
The Sri Lankan legal system is well-established and based on British Common Law, with some
influence of Roman Dutch Law and customary practices.
Key Findings
The following are the key findings:

Legal and Regulatory Framework
The Constitution has no specific provisions regarding award of contracts. Under Article 44 (1)
(a), the President may assign any subjectlfunction to a MinisterMinistry. As such, the President has
assigned to the Minister of Finance the subject of the “Government Financial regulations, Interpretation
and Amendments, etc.” Chapter XI11 laid down the rules to be followed for procurement of works, goods
and services. In addition, there is no central law or provincial law regulating public procurement and the
basic contract law has no specific provisions having direct bearing on public procurement.

In order to keep the procurement process fully transparent, “timely” and to obtain the financially
most advantageous and qualitatively best services/supplies, on September 30, 1996 the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) issued “Guidelines on Government Tender Procedure.” The introduction of the
Guidelines was an epoch-making step and ushered in procurement reform. Revised Guidelinescontaining procedures both for projects financed from Consolidated Fund and Foreign Financing
Agencies-were issued on September 25, 1997 to be implemented with effect from November 1, 1997 by
all Government institutions-including Ministries, Departments, Public Corporations, Public Statutory
Bodies, fully-owned Government Companies, Provincial Councils (PC)s and Local Authorities including
Pradeshika Sabhas (PSs-for the procurement of works, services and supplies and disposal of
government assets. The Guidelines are approved only by the MOF/Cabinet and not by Parliament3.
To enhance public confidence in the system, rules of this nature which govern the use of large
amounts of public funds-although having the force of law- should be: (i) difficult to change; and (ii)

2

In association with the govemment, the Bank carried out a comprehensive assessment of the public procurement
system during the period April to November 2002. Twelve public sector organizations participated in the CPAR and
other contributors included ADB, JBIC and National Construction Contractors Association of Sri Lanka (NCCASL).

3

Most countries have public procurement laws enacted by Parliament dealing with the public procurement of goods,
works and services by governmental entities at all levels. Very few countries still follow the approach-as used in Sri
Lanka-using Financial Regulations and Guidelines.

Appendix V
Page 5 of IO

changed only in a public and transparent manner. Therefore, it is suggested that a Public Procurement
Law be enacted4. The law should be complemented by detailed Guidelines for implementation.

Entity to Oversight Policy Responsibility for Procurement Functions
There is no independent entity to provide oversight to the policy-related responsibilities of public
procurement functions, including policy formulation. In practice, the MOF has been taking this
responsibility through the Procurement Support Bureau (PSB). PSB was created in 1999 to provide
procurement implementation support, including advice on evaluation of tenders and assessment of tender
proposals. It has also tender monitoring functions. Presently the policy-making responsibility-Le.,
functions of a regulatory nature that should be carried out by an independent organization-are also being
carried out by PSB. As such, there is a need to create a small high-powered, professionally-staffed,
independent Procurement Regulatory Agency (PRA) to develop the procurement legal framework. The
functions of this agency should be confined to policy-making, documentation, development of rules, etc.
and not include line clearance functions for awarding and execution of contracts as presently done by
PSB .

Framework for Audit, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Measures
The Constitution provides for the appointment of the AG-who shall audit the accounts of all
public expenditure-and details the duties and functions of the office. The AG reports the findings on
unauthorized expenditures, waste of public funds, and abuse of procedures resulting in loss to the
Treasury. In general, the institution is seen as a watchdog and feared; however, procurement audits,
technical audits and performance audits are not conducted.
The Bribery Act (1954) and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption
Act (1994) provide a legal framework for anti-bribery and anti-corruption measures. The bribery
provisions are adequate, but reportedly implementation is poor and few have been punished. As such,
there is a need to strengthen the Bribery Commission and make it more pro-active in seeking support of
non-governmental agencies such as Transparency International (TI) in making the public aware of the
seriousness of the problem and prompt them to fight against bribery and corruption5.

Procurement Procedures and Practices
The Guidelines on government tender procedures-which
are broadly based on donor
procurement guidelines-have provided a much needed procedural framework. However, the Guidelines
have some provisions, which are not conducive for transparency and fairness. The important ones are
discussed briefly below, as well as some of the provisions which need to be clarified, supplemented,
enlarged and strengthened.

4

The law should be based on United Nations Commission on Intemational Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model on
Procurement of Works, Goods and Services with established Intemational practices, an appeakhallenge mechanism,
debriefing to unsuccessful tenderers, dispute resolution mechanism, suspension and blacklisting of firms and
publication of awards.

5

In its latest report, TI has given Sri Lanka a “Corruption Index” of 3.7. This can be compared to 3.5 for China; 2.7 for
India; 2.6 for Pakistan; and 1.2 for Bangladesh.

Appendix V
Page 6 of 10

a.

Standard tender documentsfor goods, works, and services

Except for procurement of works, there are no standard tender documents for goods, design,
supply and erect contracts, or consulting services. The quality of the tender documents-which includes
contract format and conditions4ecide the level of competition, the transparency of the process, the risks
imposed on the tenderer and consequently the price. As such, the tender documents need to be
standardized and mandated for use by all procuring entities.
b.

Registration ofjrms and contractors

Since pre-qualificatiodpost-qualification is required for works of more than Rs.5 M, the need for
registration and grading by the Institute for Construction Training and Development (ICTAD) for this
category of contracts, appears not relevant and serves no purpose. For works of value less than Rs.5 Mwhich may be large in number-going through the process of verification to meet the specified
qualification criteria in each case may turn out to be cumbersome and lead to delays. Hence, determining
the eligibility on the basis of simplified method of registration would be preferable. Also, membership in
the National Construction Contractors Association of India (NCCASL) should not be compulsory.
c.
Evaluation of tenders, evaluatiodpurchase committee, preparation of evaluation reports, approval
for award of Contracts and contract award

The procedures for the constitution of Tender Boards (TBs) and Tender Evaluation Committees
(TECs) need to be streamlined to reduce the time periods. If need be, the number of standing TBs and
TECs may be increased. The “multi-layered review approval process”-particularly for large value
contracts-needs to be simplified to expedite the process and minimize opportunities for mal-practices
and corruption. TBs need to be empowered to take award decisions on the recommendations of TECs.
While a TB may seek clarification from the TEC or reject the recommendations giving its reasons for the
TEC to reevaluate, it should not itself re-evaluate the tenders. The tenders need to be awarded within the
initial validity period.
d.

Negotiations

To improve outcome and benefits (including cost reduction and reduce uncertainties, presumably
with all tenderers), the provisions in the Guidelines are ambiguous and permit-in fact encouragenegotiations before selection of the successful tenderer. Negotiations should not be held merely to push
down the competitively quoted price of the lowest (selected) tenderer. Negotiations should be
permissible only in very exceptional circumstances (single, substantially high tender, evident/obvious
collusion, etc.) with prior government approval and that too by a high level committee.
e.

Standard finctional specijcations for goods

To bring consistency and increase transparency, there is a need to develop standard functional
specifications, particularly for goods that are usually procured by various implementing agencies. Placing
of these specifications on the PSB website inviting comments from manufacturers, suppliers and users
will lead to refinement of specifications.

J

‘Tender Capacity ’ as a criteria for award of contracts

“Tender Capacity” should be made a mandatory criteria for award of contracts. Specific
requirements in this respect should be pre-disclosed in the tender documents. The contracts on hand need
to be assessed to determine the available capacity net of current commitments and ability of the tenderer

Appendix V
Page 7of 10

to perform the new contract satisfactorily, if awarded. In addition, where the tenderer is lowest in more
than one tender or slice of a package, the qualification requirements to be satisfied by the lowest tenderer
need to be the aggregate of the individual tenders or slices of a package.
Electronic tendering

g.

One of the major steps towards e-governance is e-tendering. Systems are available to introduce
electronic tendering in public agencies. This will substantially increase transparency, efficiency and
reduce scope for mal-practice and corruption. The Procurement Law should also cover e-tendering
aspects.
Areas for improvement in the guidelines

h.

Some of the other procurement aspectdareas covered in the Guidelines which need to be
clarified, supplemented, enlarged or strengthened are:
e

Provisions for incorporating minimum functional specifications in accordance with national/
international standards for goods; ICTAD detailed specifications or other Sri Lankan standards
for works;

e

Specify the various methods of procurement including their applicability for contracts financed
by the Government’s consolidated fund at a single place for easy usage by all executive agencies;

e

Wide gap between the thresholds for optional and mandatory pre-qualification requirements;

e

Adequate guidance to the implementing agencies on the incorporation of the price adjustment
provision;

e

Unusual provisions empowering the Secretary to waive liquidated damages for special reasons, if
provided for in the tender documents;

e

Restrictive provisions for sale of tender documents to only those who are registered contractors
and members of NCCSAL;

e

Stipulations on the date of start and close of issue (sale) of tender documents;

e

Different tendering periods for tenders financed by internal and external sources;

e

Different procedures for correction of errors and establishing the tender price for donor and
Consolidated Fund financed tenders;

e

Price and/or purchase preferences provision, and exemptions for submission of tender security
deposit to a group of organizations (such as approved societies and parastatals);

e

With regard to types of insurances to be taken out and coverage, removal of the stipulation that all
insurance should be from government-owned insurance companies;

e

Cumbersome procedures for evaluation of unbalanced tenders and different procedures for
tenders financed from donor agencies and consolidated fund; and
Procedures for hiring of consultants, methods of selection and types of contracts.

Though a commendable effort has gone into the drafting of the Guidelines, they need revision to
include provisions as discussed above and exclude those provisions which should be covered by the
Standard Tender Documents.

Appendix V
Page 8 of I O

Organization and Resources
Procurement functions are mostly decentralized. The concerned Ministries and Provincial
Councils are responsible for procurement within their organizations and the Guidelines govern public
procurement in all organizations. The Guidelines are available for sale and all the procurement entities
are aware of the Guidelines and the thresholds prescribed therein. However, the delegation of contracting
authority is inadequate. Since tenders beyond a certain value have to be referred to the Cabinet for
decision, the possibility of political interference in decision-making is a distinct possibility.
Furthermore, there is no separate procurement cadre or procurement core group in the country
and most of staff carrying out procurement functions are from general engineering or accounting
backgrounds and are inexperienced and are not specially trained in procurement. Furthermore, contract
administration is weak, resulting in cost and time over-runs.
PSB was established to improve public procurement performance in Sri Lanka and improve the
efficiency of procurement processes to expedite the economic and social development of the country for
the betterment of the Sri Lankan people. However, the PSB has a lot of independent responsibilitiese.g., it also acts as a support office for MOF for preparation of briefs for the Cabinet Appointed Tender
Board (CATB) sub-committee, as well as CATB and Cabinet; it is involved in the appointment of
members for TB and TECs. Therefore, PSB needs to be strengthened and manned by competent officers
and technical experts, and should deal with planning, setting of standards and monitoring of outcomes and
capacity building, including training. PSB should also be entrusted with the responsibility for
implementation of the CPAR Action Plan.

Procurement Capacity Building System and Institutions
PSB contains a training unit. Due to the large number of officers requiring training in public
procurement procedures, a “Train the Trainer” type approach has been adopted by PSB with selected
senior officers in the key sector agencies being trained and supported to conduct training within their
respective agencies. A training master plan has been prepared and PSB’s Training Unit has been
conducting some programs. Nevertheless, the training effort is inadequate and has to be increased
substantially to cover all staff involved in procurement functions. Courses should be developed for
various levels and types of staff on a number of topics, including public procurement policies; rules; good
practices; standard tender documents; evaluation of tenders; contract management, etc. The training
master plan needs to be reviewed, updated and effectively implemented. Further, efforts are required to
be made to include public procurement and contract administration’ courses in the curricula of
engineering, commerce, law and business management courses at the Graduate and Post Graduate levels.

Public Sector Management Pe~ormance
Contract administration and monitoring is neglected, reflecting poor implementation capability in
general. Clear contract provisions and “right-sizing” of contracts play a vital role in efficient
implementation. Similarly, clear and complete specifications and well-defined performance standards can
reduce disputes and ensure satisfactory works contract performance. With respect to goods contracts,
contract administration is also weak, particularly with respect to inspection and taking over. Even for
consultancy contracts, the monitoring of the completion of all the stipulated tasks as per the “description
of services’’ and the timing and contents of the reports to be submitted, is rather poor.

Appendix V
Page 9 of IO

Performance on World Bank and ADB-financed Projects
The most serious shortfalls in contract awards are due to: (i) delays in contract awards resulting
from delays in carrying out procurement actions according to Guidelines, lack of authority given by
executing agencies to project directors, delays in approval procedure of TEC and CATB and unfamiliarity
with ADB Procurement Guidelines; (ii) delays in establishing project units and appointing project staff;
(iii) time consuming procedures for land acquisition and resettlement; and (iv) delays in preparation of
documents and TOR finalization; and (v) inadequate counterpart funds and budget allocations.

General Risk Assessment
Donor agencies finance a substantial portion of public sector procurement in Sri Lanka. The
government follows the procurement procedures as stipulated by the donor agencies in the Loadcredit
Agreements. Also, the government has issued the “Guidelines for Government Tender Procedure” which
establish the procedures and are generally being followed for contracts financed from Government’s own
Consolidated Fund. Implementation of contracts lacks efficiency and needs improving. However, there
are inadequacies in the Guidelines and Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs). Public procurement would
improve vastly if the recommendations made in this report are fully implemented. This may take some
time, but with the introduction of SBDs, marginal improvements in the Guidelines, better implementation
monitoring by PSB and intensified capacity building effort, Sri Lanka’s risk rating for procurement
purposes could improve substantially.

Competitiveness and Participation of Private Sector in Public Procurement:
The private sector needs to be equally more efficient, competent, healthy, honest and vigilant if
public procurement is to function effectively. The construction industry is in an infant stage in Sri Lanka
and until recently, all big contracts have been awarded to foreign contractors. To develop the
construction industry, ICTAD has been conducting training courses. With this, domestic contractors are
participating in the tenders and also winning them. The consultant services profession has not developed
in Sri Lanka and consultants are usually from outside the country. However, local consulting firms andor
individuals are becoming associated with foreign firms in the form of sub-consultants or individual
experts.

Performance on Public Procurement Contracts: Quality, Timeliness, Disputes
Public procurement performance is not encouraging. Since technical auditing mechanisms are
not in place, the quality of construction-particularly for small value contracts supervised by the
employer-has scope for improvement. Contracts are generally not completed in time, thereby causing
cost and time over-runs. Disputes may arise, but they are generally settled amicably without going to
litigation. Mediation and arbitration are not very common. With a small manufacturing industry in the
country, most of the finished goods and supplies are from outside the country and their quality is
reported to be satisfactory.

Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the principal recommendations are the needs to:
Enact a Public Procurement Law;
Revise the Guidelines;
e

Create an entity to provide oversight to public procurement policy;

Appendix V
Page I O of 10

Strengthen PSB;
Develop and mandate standard tender and contract documents;
Develop standard functional specifications for goods;
Dispense with registration requirements for contracts of value more than Rs.5 million;
Introduce ‘tender capacity’ as a criteria for award of contracts;
Introduce electronic tendering progressively;
Restrict negotiations;
Simplify and streamline review and approval processes to ensure award of the contracts within
the initial validity period of tenders;
Review, finalize and implement a procurement training master plan;
Strengthen the institution of the Bribery Commission; and
Prescribe a ‘code of conduct’ for procurement professionals.
