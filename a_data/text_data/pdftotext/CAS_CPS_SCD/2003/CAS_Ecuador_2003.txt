EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY
i.
Background. This i s the f i r s t full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ecuador since 1993.
Following the 1993 CAS (R93-85), discussed by the Board on June 1, 1993, a Progress Report was
prepared in 1996-97 due to volatile political circumstances, and was discussed by the Board o n March 25,
1997, while a second Progress Report (R2000-102) was prepared following the change in Administration
in January 2000, and was discussed by the Board on June 15, 2000. This CAS for 2003-07 i s grounded
in country-wide CAS consultations undertaken in JanuaryFebruary 2003, and programming discussions
held with the Government in March 2003. It also draws on analytical work undertaken in the preparation
of a comprehensive series o f Policy Notes, takes into account lessons under the previous CAS periods and
recommendations from the 2001 Operations Evaluation Department (OED) Country Assistance
Evaluation for Ecuador, and reflects coordination with strategic partners in the donor community. In i t s
discussion o f this CAS, the Board may wish to consider the following issues:
0

A r e the CAS priorities an appropriate response to the current economic and social conditions?
I s the planned m i x and timing o f lending and nonlending instruments adequate and in line with the
Bank’s capabilities and comparative advantage?
Does the design o f the program and its triggers offer a sufficiently flexible yet careful response to
country conditions and risks?

Country Context and the Government’s Program. Ecuador has important natural resources
ii.
and unique biodiversity, but i t has not fulfilled its potential. Real income per person has remained
unchanged during the past two decades and the vast majority o f the population has remained poor. In
1999 Ecuador experienced its worst economic crisis in a century. Real income per capita shrads 9
percent, as a result of severe external shocks and internal factors. The external shocks included contagion
from crises in Asian and other emerging markets, El Nifio-related flooding, a sharp fall o i l and banana
prices, and a collapse in shrimp production due to diseases. Internal factors included persistently poor
fiscal management that led to a default on public external debt in August 1999, and a severe banking
crisis that entailed the closure of almost half the banks in the system. The national currency (formerly the
sucre) was also repeatedly devalued before the Government decided to dollarize in January 2000. After
2000, the economy experienced a fragile recovery as a new Administration began to implement economic
reforms, but lack o f political support left the reform agenda largely incomplete.

iii.
The November 2002 elections produced a shift in power towards poorer Ecuadorians. Mr. Lucio
Gutierrez was elected President with support from a coalition o f indigenous, peasant and labor
organizations. His first steps in office were to launch a National Dialogue and to take austerity measures
to stabilize the fiscal accounts. While consensus s t i l l has to be developed around a national long-term
development agenda, the new Administration has announced a medium-term development strategy that
focuses on promoting economic growth through competitiveness, reducing poverty and exclusion, and
fighting corruption. Immediate steps involve reforming customs, taxes and labor laws to consolidate the
Government’s fiscal position and to begin to increase the flexibility o f the economy in response to
external shocks. In addition, the Government i s developing proposals to strengthen the coverage and
quality o f education and health services, and to improve the targeting o f its social assistance programs.
iv.
The Bank Group’s Program and Risks. The World Bank Group has developed a Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period 2003-07 with the objective o f helping the Government to
achieve its medium term development strategy. The three key goals o f the CAS are to (a) consolidate the
macroeconomic framework and lay the foundations for diversified and sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction; (b) increase opportunities and broaden access to economic resources, and make the

1

needed structural reforms socially sustainable by mitigating the impacts on the poor; and (c) strengthen
governance by helping the Authorities build an accountable and efficient government whose services are
accessible for all Ecuadorians.
T o achieve these goals, the CAS would combine financial and technical assistance from the Bank,
including the World Bank Institute, with demand-driven support from the Intemational Finance
Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The Bank envisions up t o
$1,050 million in new loan commitments over the next four years in the base case scenario, with o n
average four operations per year. Under a high case scenario, with improved macroeconomic
management and project implementation, the ceiling for new Bank lending could be up to $50 m i l l i o n
higher per year. Under a low case scenario o f limited reforms or weak implementation o f Bank-supported
projects, the Bank does not envision any adjustment lending, and the number and value o f investment
loans would be reduced to less than half the base case envelope, and focused on direct poverty alleviation.

v.

vi,
Non-lending activities would include analytical and advisory activities related to health insurance,
education, rural development, nutrition, the environment, the financial sector, constraints to growth and
poverty assessments, among other areas, as well as diagnostic and capacity building assistance through
the World Bank Institute and support for environmental protection through the Global Environmental
Facility. These analytical and advisory activities would pave the way for related lending activities. On
the lending side, the Bank has identified education, rural production, urban poverty reduction, financial
services for the poor, rural roads, competitiveness, and natural resources management as possible new
areas for support that directly respond to needs identified by civil society, together with judicial reform
and institutional reform in order to promote increased transparency and efficiency in the public sector.
Additional support would also be provided for indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian people’s development
and for rural water supply and sanitation. These areas would be complemented by assistance with
reforms aimed at consolidating the fiscal position and promoting growth through competitiveness, and for
improving the quantity and quality o f social sector expenditures to better serve the poor.
vii.
IFC’s priorities during the CAS period will include technical assistance for promoting foreign
private investment in Ecuador, supporting the export sector, including hydrocarbons, and providing
micro, small and medium sized businesses with technical assistance or financing via intermediaries.
Given the challenging investment climate, IFC’s ability to invest in the export, financial and infrastructure
sectors w i l l continue to depend on progress with economic reform, improvement in the regulatory
framework, and macroeconomic and financial sector stability. MIGA i s considering expanded support
through investment advice and guarantees, although i t will clearly be market driven.

viii.
Ecuador continues to face important extemal risks, particularly related to terms-of-trade shocks
and competitive pressures from trading partners, which can be particularly destabilizing in a dollarized
economy. Internal risks include potential resistance to fiscal and structural reforms by social movements,
and lack o f Congressional support for reforms. While measures w i l l be taken to mitigate these risks-for
example by promoting competitiveness and market flexibility, insulating the budget more from sharp
swings in o i l prices, improving the quantity and quality o f social expenditures, and consensus building
through the National Dialogue and other processes-these risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and
significant political, economic and social risks w i l l remain. O n the other hand, Ecuador also faces a
unique opportunity to reform the structure of its political economy toward a more participatory and
transparent society, together with an economy characterized by increased stability and greater growth and
efficiency, in which the fruits of growth are shared more broadly. The new Administration’s commitment
to reducing poverty; the strong indigenous presence in the Government with their traditions o f
participatory processes to ensure consensus building and o f public oversight to strengthen transparency;
and the benefits of greater economic stabilization that have thus far come with dollarization, all represent
a significant break from the past that warrants greater Bank collaboration with and support for Ecuador.

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTIONAND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION
AND THE MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
FOR THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR

I.INTRODUCTION
1.
Ecuador has unique natural and culttlral resources, but has not fulfilled its potential. In spite
of the country’s richness, real income per person has not grown during the past 20 years, and the vast
majority of the population has remained poor. The macroeconomic difficulties faced by Ecuador over the
past 20 years are largely explained by i t s political and socioeconomic context (Section 1I.A). A culture of
state paternalism toward both wealthy and poorer Ecuadorians, reinforced by large growth in public
sector resources after Ecuador began exporting oil in the early 1970s, was complemented by one of the
lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the region (along with Guatemala, Ecuador had tax-to-GDP ratios under 10
percent until 2000). This in turn resulted in persistent fiscal deficits, which were financed by borrowing
against oil revenues or printing local currency (formerly the sucre). Thus the national debt quadrupled
between 1980 and 2000, while real GDP per capita remained unchanged, and price inflation averaged 30
percent in the late 1990s. The high rates of inflation in turn led to pressures to devalue the sucre, which
between mid-1998 and January 2000 lost threequarters of i t s value (moving from S.6,OOO to S.28,OOO per
U.S. dollar) before the government decided to dollarize in January 2000.
2.
The late 1990s witnessed Ecuador’s worst economic crisis in more than a century, as a result of
a combination o f internal and external factors. The internal factors included persistently poor fiscal
management that eventually led to a default on external debt in August 1999, and a collapse in the
banking sector that same year, resulting in the freezing o f bank deposits and the closure of almost half the
banks in the system, at a cost o f at least 15 percent o f GDP. The external factors included a sharp capital
outflow from the region as a result of contagion following crises in Asian and other emerging markets;
the simultaneous decline in Ecuador’s three main exports as oil and banana prices collapsed and diseases
ravaged shrimp production; and close to $3 billion in damages due to El Niiio-related flooding in coastal
regions. B y January 2000, the economy was devastated by a severe economic crisis, rising poverty,
default on public debt, frozen bank deposits and a collapsing banking system, production systems in
disarray, and a major indigenous uprising supported by members o f the military.

3.
The decision of the new Administration that assumed power in January 2000 to maintain
dolhrization made it clear that Ecuador could no longer look back. With or without dollarization, a
series of structural reforms became essential in Ecuador to increase economic growth, share the benefits
of growth more evenly, and to improve governance, making government services accessible to all. The
government o f former President Noboa took several steps to implement reforms, including the so-called
Trole Z and Trole ZZ laws of 2000, that established the basis for dollarization and began to increase
flexibility in labor markets and increase the scope for private participation in services long provided by
public enterprises. In addition, the Fiscal Responsibility Law approved in 2002 set clear l i m i t s on
expenditure growth and indebtedness, as dollarization imposes a new discipline on the country (Section
II.C). The improved fiscal position relative to the pre-dollarization period, the progressive unfreezing o f
deposits, and improved oil prices, together with a more stable environment under dollarization, led to a
recovery in economic growth that s t i l l needs to be consolidated over the next few years.

1

4.
The November 2002 elections resulted in a major shi@ in power toward poorer Ecuadorbns.
Mr. Lucio Gutierrez was elected President with support from a coalition o f indigenous, peasant, and labor
organizations o n a mandate to fight corruption, promote economic recovery, and reduce poverty b y
improving economic justice. President Gutierrez’ s election reflects widespread rejection o f the politicsas-usual that had produced two decades o f weak economic performance and rising poverty. H i s f i r s t steps
in office were to launch a National Dialogue and to take austerity measures t o stabilize the fiscal accounts
(Section V). In addition, the Administration has developed plans to introduce several key reforms in
legislation t o Congress, as part o f i t s economic reform program, that are designed to strengthen and
stabilize the fiscal accounts, promote reforms in financial and labor markets, increase the efficiency o f
public enterprises, and increase access to and the quality o f education, health, and other public services
(Section V). The Government’s medium-term economic reform program has received IMF support
through the approval o f a new 13-month Stand-By Arrangement.

5.
The current environment presents risks but also an important opportunity for Ecuador. There
are several risks to the success of this program, due to continued macroeconomic vulnerability, resistance
from entrenched interests, and concerns within the indigenous movement allied with the President about
the impact o f the reform program on the poor. On the other hand, Ecuador also faces a unique
opportunity to reform the structure o f i t s political economy toward a more participatory and transparent
society together with an economy characterized b y increased stability and greater growth and efficiency,
in which the fruits o f growth are shared more broadly. The new Administration’s commitment to
reducing poverty; the strong indigenous presence in the Government with their traditions o f participatory
processes to ensure consensus building and o f public oversight to strengthen transparency; and the
benefits o f greater economic stabilization that have so far come with dollarization, all represent a
significant break from the past that warrant greater Bank collaboration with and support for Ecuador.
11. THECOUNTRY
CONTEXT
A. Political, Socioeconomic, and Historical Context
6.
Ecuador is a country with unique advantages. I t i s strategically located at a prominent part o f
South America on the Pacific Ocean, and has significant o i l reserves in both the coastal region and the
interior. Although Ecuador i s one o f the smallest countries in South America, i t s mainland combines a
tropical coastal region (the Costa), a fertile highland valley in the Andes (referred to b y Humboldt as the
“Avenue o f the Volcanoes”), and a largely unspoiled Amazon interior, which together with the unique
Galapagos Islands 600 miles offshore, make Ecuador one o f the most biodiverse countries in the world,
with an estimated 9.2 species per square kilometer. This natural richness has enabled Ecuador to compete
successfully over time in the production and export o f cocoa, bananas, coffee, shrimp, tuna, and more
recently ornamental horticulture and palm oil, and to produce such staples as maize, beans, and rice, as
well as livestock, mainly for the domestic market.

7.
In addition to this r i c h natural diversity, Ecuador enjoys a significant cultural diversity. I t s
population o f 12 million combines a predominant mestizo population with indigenous nations and peoples
based primarily in the highland region (the Sierra) and the Amazon (estimated at 15 to 25 percent o f the
population), and an important Afro-Ecuadorian population (estimated at 5 percent o f Ecuadorians),
mainly in northern provinces and in the two largest cities, Guayaquil and Quito. The ethnic diversity
brings with i t a richness o f languages, cultures, and traditions.
8.
I n spite of its natural and cultural wealth, Ecuador has long had a turbulent and fragmented
political history. This i s evinced b y 19 Constitutions since independence in 1830-the most recent o f
which was ratified in 1998. Many o f the issues contributing t o the turbulence remain unsolved, including
regional tensions between the Costa, centered around the port city o f Guayaquil, and the Sierra, centered
in the capital city, Quito. One consequence o f the regional rivalry, which dates back to colonial times, i s
2

that the central Government has had limited effective power, and Congress has been characterized by an
unusually large number of political parties for a country of Ecuador's size, making effective governance a
challenge. This rivalry has also made it harder to agree on acceptable mechanisms for decentralization.
9.
Another important legacy of the colonial period i s a history of exclusion of the majority of the
population. Ecuador has among the highest Gini coefficients of income inequality and of inequality in
land distribution in the world. The wealthiest 10 percent of the population, with 42 percent of GDP, earn
70 times more than the poorest 10 percent, with only 0.6 percent of GDP. The history of exclusion and
serfdom based on large haciendas or landholdings as recently as the last century eventually gave rise to
major indigenous uprisings in the 1990s. In addition, a significant incidence of entrepreneurial rentseeking through trade preferences and tax avoidance or evasion, often coupled with cost containment via
lowering real wages, have constrained productivity-based economic growth and resulted in disaffected
labor movements in the private sector. On the other hand, public sector employees have acquired
privileged positions and significant political clout, which in a context of limited accountability and public
disclosure has in certain cases led to allegations of rent-seeking and corruption. More generally, Ecuador
has in recent years consistently ranked among the countries with the highest perceived incidence o f
corruption in Latin America.

10.
I n this context, there have been increasing demands among indigenous movements and social
classes for greater participation in political strategy setting and decisionmaking. The current
environment presents an opportunity for strengthening participatory planning, budgeting, and consensusbuilding processes that have flourished at the local level in several municipalities and in at least one
province, up to the national level in the form of a National Dialogue. This process will take time to
establish roots at the national level and to have a clear impact on the budget; however, a successful, open,
and participatory National Dialogue process promises the beginnings o f a comprehensive development
framework for Ecuador, and the possibility of making a sustainable impact on reducing poverty.

B. Poverty and Social Conditions
11.
Poverty and inequality have increased in the past two decades. Real economic growth per
capita in Ecuador was negative during 1980-89 (-0.6 percent), and was zero during 1990-99. On the
other hand, the Gini coefficient has increased steadily over the past two decades, reaching 0.62 for urban
areas as of 2001. That year the richest quintile of the population earned 64 percent of incomes, while the
poorest quintile earned 1.7 percent. With no growth in real income per capita and increasing inequality,
Ecuador had experienced rapidly growing poverty over the past two decades even before going through
i t s worst economic crisis of the last century in 1999, when real income per capita fell 9 percent.
12.
Poverty, as measured by consumption indicators (that is, the proportion of the population that
cannot afford the basic consumption basket), rose from 34 percent to 56 percent of the population
between 1995 and 1999, reaching 77 percent among rural inhabitants and over 90 percent among
indigenous rural communities. One-third of the rural population in Ecuador in 1999 was characterized by
extreme poverty, that is, they were unable to afford the critical i t e m o f the consumption basket.' In
terms of income indicators for poverty, most of the gains in urban poverty reduction during 1990-97 were
although poverty in terms of income has declined again since
lost in the subsequent crisis (Figure l),
dollarization in 2000. One-third o f urban dwellers and 60 percent of rural inhabitants in Ecuador lived on
less than $2 per person per day in 2001. This represents a decline from 40 percent of urban and 70
percent of rural inhabitants in 2000. There is, therefore, an important share of the poor who are not
chronically poor, but rather who slip back into poverty during economic downturns, and who do not have
access to an adequate countercyclical safety net to protect them.

13.
Although the economy has grown and poverty has declined since 2000, the benefits of economic
growth since dollarization have accrued to a greater extent to wealthier Ecuadorians, and inequality has
continued to rise. Between 1999 and 2001, the Gini coefficient rose from 0.57 to 0.62, as new
employment opportunities for workers lagged behind the recovery in economic growth, and a large onetime adjustment in prices led to an initial decline in real wages, since the latter necessarily need to be
related to increases in productivity.

Who are the poor in Ecuador? In addition to being more prevalent in rural than in urban areas,
14.
poverty i s more prevalent among indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian populations than among white mestizo
populations, higher among female-headed than male-headed households, and more prevalent in the
Amazon, central highland regions (such as Chimborazo and Cotopaxi), or certain coastal regions (such as
Esmeraldas, Los Rios, Manabi) than in the provinces that surround Quito and Guayaquil (see Annex Map
o f Ecuador).
15.
Since wages are the primary source o f income for poor households, poverty i s higher among the
unemployed and underemployed who, respectively, account for 8 percent and 55 percent of the
economically active population, than among households headed by workers employed in the formal
sector. In urban areas, low human capital and productivity and lack of employment opportunities are the
underlying drivers of poverty. In rural areas, poverty i s tied to low on-farm and off-farm productivity,
which i s the result of inadequate technology and infrastructure, together with lack of access to land and
credit, and inadequate human capital development-according
farmers has completed primary school.

16.
The poor are also likely to have significant unmet basic needs, especially in rural areas. Only 25
percent of the population i s covered by public health insurance, and about 30 percent have no access to
basic health care services. Net primary enrollments are unchanged at 90 percent since 1990, while net
secondary enrollments increased only 1 percent during the 1990s to 44 percent. At the primary level, one
in five children in the poorest quintile i s not enrolled, while school participation by the richest decile i s
100 percent. On average, Ecuadorians have 7.5 years of education, but only 5 years in rural areas, and 2.5
years among indigenous Ecuadorians. One-third of rural households do not have access to safe water or
electricity, and only 3 percent of rural homes (and only 15 percent of all homes in Ecuador) have access
to telephones. Poverty also correlates with low-quality lands and environmental degradation in rural
4

areas, and exposure to unsafe water, precarious housing, and deficient waste disposal services in urban
areas.
Women and children are particularly vulnerable. Women have lower educational completion
17.
rates than men (64 percent compared to 69 percent at the primary level), and higher illiteracy rates (12
percent compared to 8 percent for men, with a substantially larger gender literacy gap in the indigenous
population). Consequently, women have fewer employment opportunities, especially in urban areas in
the Coast, where unemployment rates are significantly higher for women than for men (20 percent
compared to 8 percent), and earn salaries that are one-third lower than for men. Despite passage of the
Free Motherhood Law, one-quarter of Ecuadorian women do not receive any prenatal care, and the
maternal mortality rate, at 159 per 100,000 live births, i s high. Gender i s also an important variable in
household coping strategies, with more women joining the labor force during downturns, but taking on
poorly paid and precarious work in the informal sector. Similarly, children are withdrawn from schools
during economic downturns both to contribute to family income and to avoid education-related expenses.
At present, one in eight children aged 5 to 17 i s employed, with employment rates for children rising
particularly sharply between ages 13 (34 percent) and 16 (58 percent). The labor force participation rate
of 16-year-olds in Ecuador i s significantly higher than in other Andean countries such as Bolivia (39
percent) or Colombia and Peru (around 30 percent). Moreover, there i s a high rate of chronic
malnutrition among children, affecting 44 percent of children in the poorest quintile, and one-third of
Ecuadorian children are stunted in terms o f anthropomorphic (size/weight) measures.
Zncreasingpoverty has led to worsening social conditions. Crime rates have risen sharply in the
18.
major urban areas since 1995, as a result of rural-urban migration, lack of employment, poverty, and
inadequate enforcement. In addition, the prevalence o f high rates of alcoholism and domestic violence
(again with inadequate enforcement or support for women) have been documented in various studies.
Lack of employment has led to an estimated half-million Ecuadorians migrating abroad to North America
and Europe since 1997, leaving 1 in 12 children with at least one parent abroad. While the out-migration
has resulted in $1.5 billion in annual remittances, (or $140 per person, the highest rate per capita in Latin
America after El Salvador and the Dominican Republic), the migration has also had a severe impact on
the social fabric, particularly o f rural communities.

19.
To address chronic poverty and worsening social conditions, i t will be essential to ensure greater
equity and inclusion of the poor in Ecuadorian society, because their voices have gone largely unheard in
the determination of economic policies (Section 1I.D and Annex D). The policy bias against the poor i s
reflected in the disproportionate tax burden borne by lower-middle-income compared to higher-income
Ecuadorians, subsidies that disproportionately benefit the richer half of the population, the low level of
social expenditures compared to other Latin American countries, and the low quality o f those social
expenditures, whether in terms of the efficiency of public services, or the degree to which they are
targeted to the poor, or the degree to which they provide an anticyclical support to the poor (Sections 1II.C
and N.C).

C. Recent Economic Developments and Performance
20.
The Bank has prepared a comprehensive set of Policy Notes covering economic growth and
competitiveness issues, poverty, social sector and governance themes, as a proposal for economic and
social recovery.’ These Policy Notes underpin the macroeconomic and sectoral analysis throughout this
CAS, and key findings are highlighted in this Section and in Section IV.C on the Bank Group’s program.
~~

2. The Policy Notes were started in November and presented to the President and h i s Cabinet on January 11, 2003. They cover
the macroeconomy and competitiveness, tax reform, trade reform, labor markets, and the civil service, decentralization,
govemance and anticorruption, judicial reform, hydrocarbons, financial sector development, urban development, rural
development, environmental protection, basic infrastructure (energy, telecommunications, transport, and water), education,
health, social security, and social protection. The Notes will be published in May 2003 and disseminated thereafter.

Ecuador’s macroeconomic conditions are stabilizing. Benefiting from a positive extemal
environment characterized by high petroleum prices, low intemational interest rates, and significant flows of
family remittances, GDP grew 2.8 percent in 2000, 5.1 percent in 2001, and an estimated 3.0 percent in 2002.
Average annual inflation fell to 38 percent in 2001, and reached single digits by late 2002 (Figure 2), while
unemployment fell from 14.4 percent in 1999 to 8.5 percent by 2002. In many ways, the economy has
performed much better than projected at the time of the last CAS Progress Report in June 2000 (Table l),
with
some key exceptions, includinginflation, export growth, and the debt servicdexports and reservedimportsratios.

22.
The economic recovery since 1999 i s explained by the increase indomestic demand (particularly private
demand), stimulated in turn by high pemleum prices, growing remittances, an (unsustainable) increase in public
expenditures, and a gradual reactivationof private credit, consistent with the continuing recovery of the banking
system Construction of a new pipeline for heavy crude oils (OCP) was the main factor that attracted significant
inflows of foreign investmentafter 2001 (Annex Table B6).
23.
For its part, the initial inflationary impulse, followed by a gradual decline in inflation, fits into the pattem
observed inmost dollarizedeconomies: in the mediumterm, the domestic inflation rate tends to be determinedby
intemational inflation, but in the short term, lags occur in relative price adjustment due to the control of certain

6

managed prices belongingto the basic basket, and to the postcrisis reactivationof domestic demand. Moreover,
Ecuador began i t s dollarization with an undervalued real effective exchange rate, which had to appreciate
somewhat. However, the continued increase in the price of nontradables relative to tradable goods i s affecting
Ecuador’s competitiveness. Thus significant efforts are required to boost productivity and competition in
domestic markets so as to contain the rise inprices of nontradables and maintainEcuador’s competitive position.

24.
Despite improvement, the recovery &j?a&le. The key sources of vulnerability are the fragile fiscal
position, Ecuador’s worsening competitiveness, and the lack of flexibility in domestic markets to respond to
shocks, which i s an even greater concem under dollarization. While national government revenues have
increased significantly since 2000, revenues from oil (which account for around 40 percent of all revenues)
have been volatile, and instead of building up savings in good times, the Executive and the Legislature have
allowed revenue increases to be outpaced by expansionary spending policies, thereby complicating mediumterm fiscal sustainability. In particular, primary surpluses of the Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS), which
are fairly high by Latin American standards, have decreased from 7.7 percent of GDP in 2000 to 4.5 percent
of GDP in 2002. Moreover, after covering interest on public debt, overall fiscal balances have been marginally
positive to negative during the last two years. The primary surpluses could certainly have been maintained at
higher levels, were it not for the expansionary trend in current primary spending. The overall budget increased
from $4.9 billion (23.3 percent of GDP) in 2001 to $6.7 billion (an estimated 25 percent of GDP) in 2003.
Spending on public sector wages has doubled since 1999 to around $2 billion, rising 55 percent injust the last
year, while public goods expenditures have increased by 80 percent to $900 million over the same period.
Finally, public expenditures have been extremely inflexible, with 95 percent of the budget pre-assigned to debt
service, public salaries or legally mandated expenditures, leaving only 5 percent to adjust more readily
according to changing circumstances (Figure 3).
25.
Following El Niiio and the strong capital outflows from Latin America in 1999, there was some
improvement in Ecuador’s external position in 2000. This improvement followed the successful
negotiation of an IMF Stand-By Arrangement, within an overall package of $2 billion from multilaterals,
in March 2000; the repurchase of $6.4 billion in old Brady Bonds and Eurobonds at a 40 percent discount
in August 2000; the rescheduling of debt owed to the Paris Club in September that year, and a recovery in

7

o i l prices. As a result, “excess freely disposable intemational reserves” went from negative-US254
million in 1999-to positive-US$776 million in 2000. However these reserves have declined two years
in a row, halving to about US$400 million in 2002, mainly due t o a reversal in the current account
position from a 6.3 percent surplus in 2000 t o a 5.0 percent deficit in 2002.

The productive sector is losing competitiveness. About 80 percent o f the current account
26.
imbalance corresponds to a rising deficit in the trade balance. This i s in turn largely explained by
declining o i l exports (in spite o f higher o i l prices) due t o reduced o i l production b y Petroecuador; falling
exports in the key banana and shrimp industries due to market access problems in Europe and t o pest
problems, respectively; loss o f competitiveness relative to neighboring countries Colombia and Peru, the
currencies o f which depreciated sharply against the dollar; growth in imports o f consumer goods as
remittances increased and overall GDP recovered; and increased imports o f intermediate and capital
goods (in part for the OCP pipeline) as Ecuador’s productive sector began t o plan for longer-term growth
under dollarization. The latter includes a major but temporary surge in imports accompanying
construction o f the OCP, which i s fully financed by foreign investment inflows in the capital account for
about 3 percent o f the 2002 GDP. The sharp swing in the trade balance was on the other hand
accompanied b y a rapid decline in net interest payments o n external debt (nearly US$500 million) and
growth in remittances, which became the second-most-important source o f foreign currency, representing
about 6.5 percent o f GDP in 2002.

27.
Ecuador has been unable to take full advantage of recent high oil prices due to
underinvestment in hydrocarbons. Ecuador has proven reserves o f close t o 5 billion barrels, or 30-years
equivalent o f production, i s expanding i t s pipeline capacity through the OCP, has a pool o f potential
private investors, and has qualified technicians in the industry. There are few industries in which Ecuador
could increase production as rapidly as in hydrocarbons. And yet private investment in the sector has
flattened or declined, while production b y Petroecuador has fallen b y one-quarter over the past four years
alone. Ecuador has not been able to take advantage o f the recent exceptionally high o i l prices, has not
managed the o i l revenues that it has generated as efficiently as i t could, and, importantly, has fallen short
o f best practices in ensuring adequate prevention and management o f potential environmental and social
impacts. The reasons are an inadequate legal, regulatory, and institutional framework; uncertain and
inappropriate taxation and pricing policies; insufficient transparency in o i l revenue collection and
management mechanisms; institutional limitations related to environmental and social protection; and
inadequate attention o f key policymakers t o the sector in light o f other macroeconomic priorities. In light
o f the critical role that the industry can play and needs to play t o generate revenues for sustainable
8

development, it will be important for the Government to develop and implement a strategy that addresses
each of these shortcomings.

The financial sector has recovered significantly, but is still not deep or robust enough to be an
28.
engine for growth. One important reason that the economy was not able to respond to the sharp initial
devaluation in the real effective exchange rate was the collapse o f the financial sector in 1999, which
resulted in relatively limited access to credit in subsequent years. Bank deposits have now almost
recovered to precrisis levels, growing by $2 billion since 1999 (which i s fairly rapid for a post-crisis
economy); however, the absence of a credible lender o f last resort coupled with a run on deposits in July
2001 has led banks to self-insure via high liquidity ratios, and to maintain excess reserves outside o f the
country. In addition, the financial system’s lack of access to long-term funding and caution regarding
term transformation risk has inevitably limited long-term credit for the private sector. Moreover, banks
have been prudently building loan-loss reserves and capital in the run-up to meeting Bade capitaladequacy standards by December 2003. Credit growth has therefore not kept up with growth in deposits,
with banking sector loans at only 13 percent of GDP as of 2002. Moreover, while deposit interest rates at
around 5 percent are negative in real terms, the domestic on-lending rates faced by Ecuadorian producers
and traders are high compared to those o f foreign competitors, as they range from 12 to 18 percent
(relative to a 9 percent domestic inflation rate and a 2 percent international inflation rate in dollars).
Banks have also tended toward financing consumer credit as producers have become less competitive,
and have yet to expand significantly into lending to micro-and small-scale enterprises or into providing
investment capital for manufacturing and agriculture or medium-termmortgage financing.
The labor market is still insufficiently flexible to absorb external shocks through price rather
29.
than real adjustments. The Economic Transformation Law o f August 2000 permitted the hiring of
workers on a per-hour basis for the f i r s t time, thereby alleviating some o f the rigidities of the labor
market. However, these measures have been insufficient to ensure that adjustments in response to
external shocks occur through prices rather than through production and employment. Critical challenges
remain in reducing the costs of hiring workers (including a 15 percent profit-sharing law) and releasing
workers (including high severance entitlements, especially in the public sector). Moreover, the law s t i l l
mandates an annual increase in wages, which if not agreed between workers and employers, i s required
by law to be equal to the rate of inflation.

30.
Overall, Ecuador i s at an important stage in the dollarization process in which further fiscal
consolidation i s essential, together with improvement of the legal and institutional framework to promote
competitiveness and growth, enhanced banking supervision and financial sector strengthening, and more
flexible input markets, especially for labor, in order to be in a better position to absorb external shocks
under a rigid monetary and exchange rate regime through prices rather than real domestic adjustments.

D. Perspectives of Civil Society
3 1.
The Bank has maintained a continuous dialogue with Ecuadorian civil society in recent years.
Ecuador i s one of six countries participating in the Structural Adjustment Participatory Review Initiative
(SAPRI), which has provided an important forum for a tripartite civil society-government-World Bank
review of adjustment policies on poverty reduction since 1996 (Annex D). In addition, with assistance
from an Ecuadorian nongovernmental organization (NGO), the Center for Planning and Social Studies
(CEPLAES), the Bank undertook and disseminated the results of a national study of “Voices of the Poor”
(Box 1). Finally, for the purposes o f the CAS, the Bank has participated in the National Dialogue process
(Section 111, Box 2), and undertook a two-week consultation in nine different cities across the country in
early 2003 to elicit views on the country situation and national priorities, and recommended areas for
Bank support (Annex E).
32.
These major avenues for listening to civil society are complemented by a continuous dialogue
between the Bank‘s Resident Mission in Ecuador and a wide range of civil society representatives on both

9

broader socioeconomic issues and specific Bank assistance to Ecuador. This dialogue has been facilitated
by civil society staff and by gender and indigenous consultants located in the Resident Mission in Quito,
who have also taken the lead on a number o f important nonlending activities with civil society. For
example, the Bank has promoted social accountability through nonlending support to develop guidelines
on consultations for mining and hydrocarbons investments and community oversight o f mining activities.
With support from the Japanese government, the Bank has built greater gender consciousness into i t s
portfolio of investment projects, particularly Prodepine, which i s designed to support rural indigenous and
Afro-Ecuadorian communities. In addition, with support from the Norwegian government, the Bank has
hired an indigenous consultant in the Resident Mission to work on gender and intercultural issues,
including analysis of indigenous social capital, particularly as it relates to indigenous women’ s productive
activities. Moreover, to improve outreach to important but frequently marginalized segments of the
population, the Bank and the key indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian organizations in Ecuador established
an Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian People’s Advisory Council for the Bank in 2001. The Council
reviews the Bank‘s portfolio in Ecuador as part of the Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR)
process, and provides upstream advice on the design of new operation^,^ and i t s members participated in
the CAS consultations.
Box 1. “Voices of the Poor” Identify P r o b l e m and Solutions for Poverty
“In order to be free of poverty, Iimagine there must be a little o f everything, electricity, water, land, animals,
livestock.. .the needs of the home.. .” -Consultations with the Poor, Ecuador, July 1999.

Ecuador participated together with 22 other countries in a global consultation effort to hear the voices o f the poor, as
an input into the World Development Report 2000/01. More than 500 men and women, o f different ages and ethnic
origins, living in urban and rural areas of half o f Ecuador’s 22 provinces, were interviewed in a process led by the
Center for Planning and Social Studies (CEPLAES), an Ecuadorian NGO. Topics ranged from the definition o f
well-being to problems and priorities, “spaces o f poverty” related to access to basic services, gender relations,
institutionality, and challenges for an agenda for change. Key findings o f the voices of the poor echo those of the
SAPRI process and of the Bank’s CAS consultations:
Poverty affects not only material well-being but also psychological well-being, and i s reflected in the
constrained capacity to decide and act, and in feelings o f depression and loss o f hope.
Employment and self-improvement are very important; the poor want opportunities in the form o f stable
employment in urban areas and access to credit and training in rural areas, rather than handouts.
The rural poor feel isolated, while the urban poor feel trapped, subject to insecure living conditions with high
rates o f contamination, unemployment, and crime.
Gender roles have been transformed due to unemployment and migration o f men, and due to women joining the
labor force; women are more empowered while men’s self-esteem has plummeted; with support from women’s
NGOs, people are more conscious o f domestic violence and o f gender disparities.
The poor feel alienated not only from traditional politicians, but also distanced from municipal governments and
NGOs with their own agendas; thus they rely mainly on their own organizations.
An agenda for reform must include overcoming isolation, provision o f basic infrastructure, guaranteeing access
to health and education, and creating capacities and opportunities.
In 2001, Bank staff joined CEPLAES in a process o f dissemination o f the “Voices o f the Poor” survey results to
communities that had been consulted. The follow-up round was appreciated by the communities as evidence o f a
genuine exchange o f ideas, and served to reconfirm the findings o f the original surveys.

33.
The SAPRI process has permitted a series of diulogues since 1996. As an input to the SAPRI
dialogue, two national universities prepared economic studies on structural adjustment, which clearly
documented increases in poverty during the past two decades, together with the presence of a series of
IMF-and Bank-supported adjustment programs. This has led to two opposing views arising on the issue
o f structural adjustment in the dialogue. The first view i s that over the past 20 years there has been a
3. The valuable inputs provided through this process are reflectedin Section V.

10

continuous process o f orthodox, neoliberal economic measures across a range o f sectors, which although
not deep, have been sufficient to deal a major economic blow to and further impoverish the weakest
sectors o f society, particularly through price adjustments that have eliminated subsidies and fuelled
broader inflation. The second view i s that while there have been a series o f structural reform programs
over the past 20 years, in practice the reform measures taken b y the Government prior to dollarization
have been limited at best, and have failed to resolve glaring inefficiencies in public enterprises, public
service provision, and in the management o f fiscal and monetary policies. The lack o f deep structural
reforms, under this view-which i s shared b y Bank Management-has resulted in the need for a series o f
stabilization measures that have added to adverse economic conditions for the poor.
What is clear under either view is that very limited application of structural reforms as
34.
conducted in the past has not yielded the hoped-for results. On the other hand, there i s a strong demand
among civil society for a range o f reforms in the way the Ecuadorian economy operates. This i s
confirmed both in the SAPRI process and in the CAS consultations. In particular, both processes have
highlighted the increasing poverty and inequality; rising unemployment and migration; high prices;
deteriorating competitiveness; an alarming lack o f institutional capacity in public institutions; limited
coverage and poor quality o f public services ranging from health and education t o water, electricity, and
telecommunications; limited and nontransparent attempts at privatization in lieu o f genuine solutions to
improve the operations o f public enterprises; increasing environmental degradation; rising crime rates;
corruption; lack o f genuine participation in political processes; and the gradual loss o f social capital and
social values.
The Ecuadorian civil society has proposed several measures to remedy these problems. These
35.
include measures to prioritize reforms that increase access t o and the quality o f education and health;
provide incentives t o boost production and productivity by rural producers and microenterprises; improve
access to credit and technical training; strengthen participatory planning processes to develop a long-term
vision for the country; fight corruption b y increasing transparency and accountability in the public sector
t o civil society; reduce bureaucracy and promote decentralization to ensure that more resources reach the
community level; recognize and promote multicultural values and human values; and protect the
environment through greater local participation. These recommendations have been shared with the
Government and have been taken into account in the design o f the lending and Analytical and Advisory
Activities (AAA) program developed in this CAS.

111. ECUADOR’S
STRATEGY AND PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH
AND POVERTY REDUCTION
A. The Government’s Overall Development Objectives
36.
The new Administration that came to offie in January 2003 inherited a severe liquidity
problem that called for immediate corrective measures. In particular, the sharp increase in the public
sector wage bill and in unbudgeted transfers to local government during the first half o f the 2002 election
year (before the passage o f the Fiscal Responsibility Act) were approved without identifying sources o f
financing for these liabilities. Consequently, the previous Administration accumulated arrears o f an
estimated $700 million, or around 3 percent o f GDP, including arrears on Paris Club debt and on public
employee salaries.
The Government immediately adopted a two-pronged approach involving stabilization
37.
measures and longer-term reforms. First, the President signed an austerity decree that increased state
revenues by raising o i l prices and containing expenditures on public sector wages. Second, the
Government announced a five-point, medium-term development strategy to fight corruption; promote
economic growth through competitiveness; reduce poverty and exclusion; adopt a proactive and sovereign
international policy; and broadly strengthen security, in terms o f fighting crime, improving food security
and environmental security, and ensuring the predictability o f judicial proceedings (or “judicial security”).
This longer-term program was informed b y the National Dialogue process (Box 2). The Government’s
11

I

economic program has also received support from the IMJ?s Board of Directors, which approved a $205
million-equivalent Stand-By Arrangement on March 21,2003.
Box 2. The New Government Has Launched a National Dialogue Process
The National Dialogue was launched around five key topics: corruption, economic growth, poverty and exclusion,
international policy, and security. The process brings together a broad range o f government, private sector, and civil
society actors who would normally not have the inclination or opportunity to communicate with each other. I t began
with working groups o f civil society representatives in November 2002, who debated a range o f political, economic,
and social issues, and concluded i t s first phase o f activities in a National Dialogue in Quito in January 2003. A
second Dialogue was held in Guayaquil in March and plans are under way for further conventions in different cities.
The process builds on similar initiatives at the local government level, and has resulted in considerable demand that
the President keep the process open and make it increasingly inclusive and increasingly binding on the national
government. The Dialogue process clearly serves as a vehicle for building consensus for reforms, identifying areas
of disagreement, and for beginning to establish mechanisms for monitoring the implementation o f agreed policies
and actions. The new Administration's appointment o f a Secretary o f Planning and Dialogue within the Presidency
to institutionalize the dialogue process evinces a serious government commitment to the process.

38.
The overall objective of the Government's medium-term program is to bring Ecuadorian
citizens together to launch a concerted fight against poverty, through coordinated advances on
economic and social fronts. The Government has announced an ambitious set of specific monitoring
indicators to evaluate i t s program. In particular, during 2003-07, the Government's main stretch target i s
to reduce consumption poverty from 51 percent to 38 percent through sustained, high economic growth.
A summary of the key goals i s presented in Table 2. In September 2000, Ecuador joined other U.N.
members in the pursuit of Millennium Development Goals; however, it i s likely to face tremendous
challenges in achieving them all.

B. Promoting Economic Growth and Competitiveness
39.
The Government’s policies to promote economic growth are anchored around fiscal
consolidation, accompanied by a series of sectoral reforms. These reforms are designed t o relieve
microconstraints to growth in production and commerce, infrastructure, labor markets, and financial
sector development.

40.
The first priority for growth is fiscal consolid&’on. Under dollarization, the Government can n o
longer actively apply monetary and exchange rate policies, and a sound fiscal policy becomes even more
essential. T o t h i s end i t i s undertaking a short-term stabilization program involving austerity measures,
accompanied b y longer-term measures to strengthen public finances. The austerity package approved in
January 2003 includes a 20-percent reduction in the salary o f the President and o f senior public sector
officials earning more than $1,000 per month; a freezing o f all public sector salary increases in 2003;
filling only 90 percent o f government vacancies and ensuring a gradual downsizing o f the public sector;
increasing fuel prices; and the sale o f unused public assets.

4 1.
The longer-term measures involve reforming the Ecuadorian Customs Corporation, promoting tax
reforms, unifying public salaries, strengthening the Government’s SIGEF, and ensuring effective
functioning o f the fiscal stabilization fund. The Government’s legislative agenda o f urgent economic
legislation began with the submission o f a draft law in February t o Congress t o reform the Ecuadorian
Customs Corporation, where i t i s estimated that the equivalent o f a few percentage points o f GDP are lost
to fraud, corruption, inefficiency and lack o f coordination with the Internal Revenue Service (SRI).
42.
The austerity package, together with longer-term measures in customs and tax reform, civil
service reform, resolution o f failed banks, and reforms in public enterprises, permitted the signing o f a 13month Stand-By Arrangement for $205 million with the IMF. Key macroeconomic assumptions under
the Arrangement are economic growth o f 3.5 to 4 percent in 2003, annual inflation o f 6 to 8 percent by
December 2003, and a primary budget surplus target o f 5.2 percent, with agreement o n key o i l revenue
assumptions for the budget o f o i l exports o f 105 million barrels at an average price o f $18 per barrel.
The Government’s priorities in production, commerce, and infrastructure are increased
43.
competitiveness and efficiency. With regard to production, especially in rural and microenterprise
production, the Government intends to strengthen access to credit, education, and capacity building to
increase productivity. These measures are part o f an overall National Competitiveness Agenda that also
calls for aggressive promotion o f nontraditional non-oil exports, increasing measures against smuggling
o f contraband, streamlining bureaucratic requirements for producers and exporters, and improving
Ecuador’s basic supporting infrastructure, particularly in electricity generation and distribution,
telecommunications, roads and highways, ports and airports, and water and sanitation, generally through
private participation in the form o f management contracts, concessions, or in some cases (for example,
electricity generation and telephony), direct investment and ownership. In addition, Ecuador i s seeking
private investment in hydrocarbons and mining.

44.
The Government intends to complement these reforms with measures to promote a more
flexible and dynamic labor market. The Government i s developing a program for comprehensive reform
o f labor markets, including salary unification and salary adjustment mechanisms, labor hiring and f ~ n g
processes, social security reform, and human capital development. As part o f i t s tax reform legislation for
this year, the Government w i l l also propose the elimination o f the 15 percent profit-sharing requirement
in public enterprises owned exclusively by the State. T o build consensus o n broader labor market
reforms, the Ministry o f Labor has launched a stakeholder dialogue on issues including profit-sharing
rules, collective bargaining, labor productivity and competitiveness, enforcement o f labor laws, and the
widespread use o f outsourcing via temp agencies to avoid labor code requirements. The Government
aims t o build consensus on reform proposals to be included in a new Labor Code, t o be presented to
Congress next year.

13

45.
Within the financial sector, Government intends to strengthen the banking system, improve
access to credit, and resolve banking problems related to the recent crisis. The Government i s
concerned about limited outreach and high interest rates in the banking system. It has adopted a strategy
designed in the f i r s t instance to strengthen the banking system, via measures to bolster banking
supervision, raise banking standards to international levels, and strengthen the interbank payments
system, clearing and settlement mechanisms, liquidity mechanisms, and deposit insurance. In addition, it
intends t o eliminate the poorly performing Deposit Guarantee Agency (AGD), liquidate the banks under
i t s purview, and bring in international expertise to ensure transparent asset management and disposition
and pay o f f remaining depositor claims from closed banks. I t also intends to reengineer public banks, the
administration o f which has been disappointing, in order t o refocus their efforts toward small farmers,
artisans, and microenterprises (especially in the case of the National Finance Corporation and the
National Development Bank). Finally, i t intends to amend and implement the Social Security L a w to
strengthen the pension system and to elaborate policies for developing Ecuador’s nascent capital markets.

C. Reducing Poverty and Promoting Social Inclusion
46.
The Government’s target i s to reduce poverty from 5 1percent t o 38 percent and extreme poverty
from 25 percent to 10 percent b y 2007. These large reductions in poverty are to be achieved not only b y
promoting economic growth, but also via reforms to address inequality and improve access to social
assistance, education, health, and social security, and to promote social inclusion b y ensuring that social
expenditures reach the poor t o a greater extent and by ensuring broader participation in policy formulation
through the national dialogue.
47.
K e y aspects o f the reform program in social assistance w i l l include improving the coverage and
targeting o f the principal social assistance program, the bono solidurio, and increasing the monthly
amount from $11.50 to $15 per poor female head o f household. T o this end, the Govemment i s currently
strengthening i t s Beneficiary Targeting Database (Seleccih de Beneficiaries, SELBEN) and poverty
mapping. The Government also intends t o improve the targeting o f subsidies in such areas as electricity,
gas, and telecommunications t o favor the poorest and most vulnerable. Moreover, the Ministry o f
Finance w i l l be incorporated into the “Social Front” that currently comprises the Ministries o f Social
Welfare, Education, Health, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development, t o ensure better coordination
with and financing o f social sector priorities.
In the area of education, the Government i s developing an integrated vision for reforming the
48.
sector that includes reforming the education financing system, improving the timeliness o f payments to
teachers, and strengthening incentive mechanisms for ensuring teacher attendance and quality instruction,
and greater public oversight o f the education system. Specific targets are reductions in illiteracy and
increases in the average years o f school attendance from 8 years t o 9.4 years over the next four years; and
boosting primary coverage t o 95 percent, secondary enrollment from 5 1percent to 60 percent, and tertiary
enrollment from 15 percent to 18 percent. These initiatives will be developed in Ecuador in the context o f
the Decade for Literacy (2003-12) and Education for All (1990-2015). They w i l l require an increase in
the education budget from i t s current level o f 2.8 percent o f GDP toward the Latin American average o f
4.2 percent.
In health, the Govemment intends t o build on the recently approved Health L a w and to work
49.
toward a universal health coverage system. During the next four years, i t intends to reduce the share o f
the population without access to health services from 23 percent to 17 percent. B y extending health
coverage including prenatal care, the Government plans to reduce i t s monitored infant mortality rate from
11.5 to 8.8 per 1,000 live births (rates are much higher in rural areas), and the crude death rate from 4.3 t o
3.6 per 1,000 o f population. Since a critical factor in promoting health i s adequate water supply and
sewerage, the Government also intends to increase the proportion o f piped drinking water from 41.9
percent t o 49.5 percent and coverage o f sanitation systems from 46.1 percent to 54.4 percent. The

14

extension of adequate health care coverage i s to be complemented by improved old-age insurance in
terms of outreach, benefits, and the efficiency of the system, to which end the Government will present to
Congress amendments to the Social Security Law.

D. Improving Governance to Fight Corruption and Increase Security
50.
The Government was elected with a mandate to fight corruption and increase the transparency of
public services. It proposes to extend the SIGEF and i t s web-based disclosure system, Sistema de Gestidn
para la Gobemabizidad (SIGOB), and to implement a web-based public contracting system. It has also
proposed reforms to increase the coordination among key oversight agencies, including the Offices of the
Government Auditor, Attorney General, and Prosecutor, and the Anti-Corruption Commission. Indicators
of service quality and productivity w i l l be introduced throughout institutions that manage public funds.
Moreover, the Government intends to promote greater accountability and participation through the
National Dialogue process. And in the area of judicial security, i t will develop proposals together with
the judicial system and civil society with a view to strengthening contract enforcement and overall
judicial security. Finally, with respect to environmental security, Governmentthe government intends to
strengthen financing and management of the National System of Protected Areas, which will receive legal
support through a Biodiversity Law that i s currently being considered by Congress. Ecuador i s also
exploring ways to improve environmental management and to address climate change r i s k by availing
itself of carbon-rights funding in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol.

E. Prospects and Challenges for Growth and Poverty Reduction

5 1.
Ecuador needs to generate employment to reduce poverty. During the consultations processes,
civil society representatives clearly indicated that Ecuador’s poor do not want to depend on handouts,
such as the bono solidario, but rather want meaningful opportunities for employment. This i s consistent
with the fact that the most important asset, and therefore source of income, of poorer households i s their
human capital. Ecuador’s population i s growing at 1.9 percent per year, and because i t i s a young
population that has not yet gone through the demographic transition, the economically active population
i s growing at around 3 percent per year. Therefore, even more rapid growth in GDP i s required just to
absorb new entrants into the labor force, and thereby avoid increases in unemployment,
underemployment, or migration. Given these demographics, the Bank‘s analysis suggests that a 4 percent
economic growth rate would reduce consumption poverty by 1 percentage point per year. In addition,
during the 199Os, 80 percent of the change in poverty in Ecuador was driven by changes in growth rather
than distribution, however efforts to improve equality could conservatively add a further 0.25 percentage
points per year, making a 5 percentage point reduction in consumption poverty an achievable target
during the CAS period. The Government’s poverty target i s therefore clearly ambitious and will depend
on high economic growth rates (well above historical trends over the past two decades). To achieve this
and generate sufficient remunerative employment, the Government’s program focuses on creating a
favorable environment for investment by (a) ensuring a stable macroeconomic environment anchored on a
prudent fiscal framework and consolidated fiscal accounts, while simultaneously taking measures to boost
competitiveness; and (b) developing human capital. The Government will also need to prevent the
deterioration of living conditions during a difficult adjustment period and take decisive measures to
reverse the long-term trend toward greater inequality to ensure success in the fight against poverty.
52.
Dollarization has contributed to economic stabilization but also to heightened risks. As a result
o f dollarization, inflation in tradables prices has declined towards international levels for the f i r s t time in
several years. However, nontradables prices have continued to rise more rapidly than in international
markets. This i s a major concern, since adverse external shocks-such as a sharp fall in oil and other
commodity prices, real depreciation by non-US trade partners, or a significant decline in remittances or
other capital inflows-would be especially destabilizing in a dollarized economy like Ecuador, as they

15

would entail the need for an adjustment in the real effective exchange rate that could happen only through
deflation o f domestic prices in nontradables, which could in turn result in a protracted recession and debt
servicing problems for the public and nontradables sectors, with potential consequences for the financial
sector. These risks entail the need for much stricter fiscal policy in Ecuador than would be required in
non-dollarized but otherwise similar economies; the design and rigorous application o f mechanismssuch as the o i l stabilization fund-that promote savings in good times so as to be able to apply
countercyclical fiscal policies in adverse times; as well as higher liquid reserves for banks, and prudential
regulation that takes into account the risks o f significant lending to the nontradables sector.
Ecuador’s prospects of achieving sustained economic growth in the medium term depend on
53.
the successful implementation of the economic program and on sustained dollurization. In a base case
scenario, there would be no major exogenous shocks t o the currency regime and n o catastrophic natural
disasters, and the Government would (a) take effective steps to slow down expansionary spending and
increase non-oil tax revenues, to obtain sizable primary surpluses, repay i t s debt, and lower domestic
inflation; (b) induce a reduction in interest rates to slowly improve external competitiveness to foster
private-foreign and domestic-investment and exports as the main sources o f economic growth; (c)
conclude the construction o f the new o i l pipeline by end-2003, so i t can gradually increase o i l exports
from 2004; (d) generate marginal growth in o i l production in 2003-barely 2 million barrels (lower than
a result o f the l o w investment by state-run
the official forecast o f 10 million barrels)-as
PetroProducci6n; (e) proceed with a slow but steady restructuring o f the banking system; (f) clear all i t s
arrears in 2003 and prevent any further default over the next three years; and (g) provide full financing o f
the social expenditure to bring adequate protection t o the poorest, while minimizing the potentially
negative short-term impact o f adjustment measures, thus achieving minimum social and political
consensus over the difficult measures to be adopted.

54.
More specifically, the base case scenario assumes moderate growth with l o w inflation (see Table
3). During 2003-05, specific assumptions are (a) growth averaging 4 percent, with single-digit inflation
rates slowly converging to international levels; (b) a slow recovery o f the U.S. economy after the second
semester o f 2003; and (c) a short-lived, price-driven boom in o i l revenues in 2003, with a later decline in
o i l prices at least partly offset until 2005 b y increases in o i l exports through the new OCP pipeline as the
Government strengthens the regulatory and tax framework to encourage private investment. As a result,
the primary surplus o f the NFPS should average 5 percent o f GDP, for an NFPS overall balance surplus
o f 1 to 2 percent o f GDP after servicing interest on public debt. This surplus would be attained via the
approval o f several tax measures in 2003, temporarily higher o i l revenues, and declining public
expenditures in real terms. The base case scenario also envisions compliance with all fiscal rules
contained in the Fiscal Transparency, Stabilization and Responsibility L a w (LOREFIT), approved in June
2002 (Box 3). The period ends w i t h a gradual decline o f the public debt-to-GDP ratio to the minimum
sustainable ratio o f 40 percent o f GDP in 2005, the benchmark set up in the fiscal rule, as a result o f the
active repayment o f expensive domestic debt with the primary surpluses. Such ratio should continue
declining over subsequent years.

55.

On the external balances, the current account deficit would decline to about 2 t o 3 percent o f GDP
in the base case scenario, as substantial imports related to the construction o f the OCP disappear in 2004
and o i l exports begin to increase. Moreover, it i s expected that growth in remittances from Ecuadorians
working abroad may lose dynamism but remain positive. On the other hand, foreign direct investment
(FDI) i s projected to remain even or decline slightly after completion o f the OCP pipeline. Finally, it i s
expected that the economic program will lead to lower domestic inflation and a gradual increase in total
factor productivity as investment grows, and that the American Free Trade Area w i l l not have a notable
impact on Ecuador’s external balances before 2006-07.

Box 3. Ecuador’s Congress Approved a Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2002
The Organic Law for Fiscal Responsibility, Stabilization and Transparency (Law 2002-72-Registro Oficial No 589,
June 4 2002), was approved in June 2002 and regulated in February 2003 (Presidential Decree 96-Registro Ofcial,
February 10,2003), with a view to addressing persistent fiscal problems. Four key areas were targeted in particular:
0

0

0

Planning and budgeting processes: this involves unified and multiannual budgeting and fiscal goals.
Macrofiscal rules: in particular, real primary expenditure increases shall not exceed 3.5 percent per year, and the
debt-to-GDP ratio shall be reduced by 20 percent over five years, and municipalities shall not run deficits, or
exceed a 40 percent ratio o f debt to current savings.
Stabilization o f expenditures: via a Fund for Stabilization, Social and Productive Investment and Public Debt
Reduction (FEIREP), to be used for anticyclical expenditures (20 percent) and for retiring debt (70 percent)
with incremental o i l revenues from the OCP and unusually high o i l revenues from all sources, a portion o f
which (10 percent) i s also to support basic social expenditures.
Transparency and accountability: via mandatory publication o f regular fiscal reports, public access to all fiscal
information, and integrated public financial management.

These norms should bring a medium-term strategic approach into budgeting; increase predictability about the future
behavior o f some critical fiscal variables; design a long-due comprehensive debt management strategy that
guarantees external solvency in the medium term; make sure that oil revenues saved in the o i l fund are effectively
used for debt reduction, to bring down the country risk spread and facilitate investment in the non-oil economy; and
comply with ,the government’s main goal o f eradicating corruption by increased disclosure and civil society
empowerment in social auditing o f fiscal accounts.

56.
There are important external and internal risks associated with the base case projections.
Ecuador remains vulnerable to intemal and external shocks that, should they materialize, could derail the
economic program. First, the economy i s vulnerable t o terms-of-trade shocks, especially o n i t s two
leading exports, o i l and bananas. Second, remittance flows might fall faster if migration policies in laborrecipient countries like Italy, Spain, and the United States tighten significantly. Third, global economic
recovery could take longer than projected, or a significant rise in deficit spending in the United States

17

could put upward pressure on interest rates. Fourth, neighboring countries could devalue their currencies
significantly, placing pressure on Ecuador’s producers in the short term. Fifth, Ecuador i s vulnerable to
natural disasters, such as the El Niiio phenomenon, and to earthquakes or volcanic eruptions that could
damage the country’s production and infrastructure, including oil pipelines.

57.
Turning to intemal risks, the projected increase in the volume of oil production and exports might
not materialize due to inefficiencies or underinvestment by Petroecuador and continued tax-related or
regulatory impediments to private investment in hydrocarbons. Second, the fiscal and structural reform
program assumed in the base case could be delayed or derailed by political resistance, which would in
turn put the IMF Stand-By Arrangement and other multilateral assistance at risk. Finally, if entrepreneurs
fail to boost productivity or to reduce profit margin expectations toward international norms, they may
consider foreign competition unbearable under dollarization and place political pressure on the
Government to increase effective rates of protection, cut taxes, or in the end even de-dollarize. On the
other hand, the overwhelming majority of Ecuadorians surveyed indicate they would not willingly give up
their U.S. dollars for a new domestic currency, and there i s broad awareness that the structural reforms
needed in the economy to ensure growth are essential even if the country were to consider de-dollarizing,
and that de-dollarization i s not an option that would provide relief to the poor. The experience of the past
two decades has shown that fiscal and monetary indiscipline with the sucre resulted in increased poverty.
The Government has therefore firmly ruled out the possibility o f de-dollarization.
58.
The presence of an Administration firmly committed to poverty reduction also offers a
plausible high case scenario. Under this scenario, the close participation of indigenous, labor, and social
movements in the administration offers a unique opportunity to build bridges between the Government
and the broader population, including a greater understanding of the need for structural reforms to ensure
long-term growth and well-being, and a better appreciation of the measures taken to mitigate the impact
of the reform process on the poor. Similarly, the greater opening to participatory planning processes and
civil society oversight of the public sector may substantially increase transparency and reduce corruption.
Third, the Government may take more decisive steps to reduce inequality through i t s tax and expenditure
policies. Under this scenario, policy reforms have broader support, (or meet with less resistance), and are
implemented more quickly, placing the economy more quickly on a sustainable growth track.
59.
On the other hand, continued political risk could place Ecuador in a low case scenario. The
principal sources of risk are a possible reluctance on the part of all members of the ruling coalition to
support reforms that may be perceived as externally imposed structural adjustments. The reforms, such as
improving the efficiency of public services, flexibilizing domestic labor markets, improving the targeting
of subsidies toward the poor, strengthening tax collections, and eliminating trade protections that favor a
limited few, if undertaken, are expected to benefit a large share o f the population but hurt entrenched
interests that could put up significant resistance either in Congress or in public demonstrations. To this
social inclusion dimension must be added the long-standing regional dimension. If political will to carry
through reforms falters, Ecuador i s likely to continue to face fiscal problems, concentration o f resources,
poverty-enhancing inequality and political gridlock, which have all held up progress for the past 20 years.
Ecuador is at a turning point. I t s prospects for stability and economic recovery are promising, if
the economic reform program i s implemented. However, i t s fiscal and external positions remain
vulnerable due to rigidities in the economy in response to potential shocks. The economy remains highly
dependent on volatile oil and commodity export revenues, s t i l l maintains a heavy debt burden, and has yet
to ensure that efforts to contain public expenditures and make them more flexible have become firmly
rooted. In addition, Ecuadorians s t i l l need to improve the investment climate and encourage more FDI,
strengthen the financial system, and create more flexible labor markets to better absorb shocks, reduce
volatility, and ensure sustained growth. These reforms will require substantial commitment from
Ecuador’s population, together with international support.

IV. Tm BANKGROUP’S
COUNTRY
ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A. Progress Since the 2000 CAS Progress Report and Lessons from Past Bank Group Activities
61.
The objectives o f the last CAS Progress Report for Ecuador, (R2000-102, presented to the Board
on June 22, 2000), were to help the Government t o (a) protect the poor, limit human capital deterioration,
and set the basis for human development and poverty reduction in the medium and long term; (b) restore
macrofinancial stability, rehabilitate the banking system, and promote recovery in economic growth; and
(c) address key structural reforms necessary to support sustainable development and poverty reduction
over the medium and long term. The Progress Report indicated that the effectiveness o f the Bank’s
assistance should be judged in terms o f i t s ability to (a) improve protection o f the most vulnerable groups
and limit human capital deterioration; and (b) improve macroeconomic management and restore the
banking system to operability.
Ecuador has recovered on several performance measures since 2000, but has not advanced as
62.
rapidly as was hoped in certain areas. A comparison o f actual outcomes o n macroeconomic, human
development, and governance benchmarks established in the 2000 CAS Progress Report indicates more
rapid progress than expected on most macroeconomic measures, but delays in achieving the hoped-for
human development and improved governance outcomes (see the CAS Results Framework in Annex
B l l ) , due to a slow start in implementing the reform program attributable t o turnover among key
Government officials, especially in the Ministry o f Finance. Moreover, the Government has struggled to
maintain timely servicing o f i t s debts to all i t s creditors and suppliers and has yet to recover access to
private capital markets. However, i t i s important t o recognize that in almost all instances, the country i s
better o f f than two years ago. For examples among the benchmarks that were not met, inflation has
dropped from 91 percent in 2000 to 9.3 percent in 2002 (compared to the benchmark o f 5 percent); public
expenditure on both health and education has doubled in the last two years, rising to a combined 4.4
percent o f GDP, (compared to a combined 6.5 percent target); and capital adequacy o f private banks i s
being raised to Basle standards by December 2003, compared to a December 2002 target.
Progress was slower than hoped due to difficulties in achieving a consensus on reforms. The
63.
previous Administration had limited support in a divided Congress and after two decades o f “structural
adjustment” and a severe crisis that drove up poverty rates sharply in the late 199Os, there was little public
support for further adjustment. This in turn made it easier for special interests to block essential reforms
(such as increasing the efficiency o f public enterprises and the flexibility o f public expenditures), leading
in some cases to backsliding on commitment^.^ Moreover, Ecuador has had six presidents over the past
seven years, together with countless changes in Government Ministers, making i t difficult to establish a
dialogue and reach consensus on a medium-term development strategy. These risks can s t i l l not be
discounted fully in the future.

64.
The challenging environment affected the Bank Group’s assistance program. Compared to a
base case scenario o f nine loans for up t o $425 million, the final lending scenario was a l o w one, with
$280 million in eight operations. The experience with the $151 million structural adjustment operation
was disappointing, with effectiveness delayed by one year due to difficulties in ensuring a sound
macroeconomic framework after Board approval, and the cancellation o f t w o floating tranches that
supported important legal and tax reforms. On the other hand, the new Administration was able to
complete the commitments for the release o f the $30 million second tranche o n March 27, 2003. The
quality o f the portfolio o f investment projects has been affected b y persistent shortages o f counterpart
funding due to the country’s fiscal problems, but the reduction o f political influence in the selection
process o f project coordinating units, achieved with strong support from the President, helped to
4. In practice, earlier reforms might have helped to avoid or mitigate the 1999 crisis, but this view i s not universally held in
Ecuador.

19

strengthen the technical quality and continuity of project management. Overall, development impact i s
believed to be satisfactory. In terms of technical assistance, the Bank prepared important AAA products,
but high turnover rates in key government positions did not permit adequate follow-up in several cases,
such as on decentralization, anticorruption, and procurement, although AAA on gender, SAPRI, and
“Voices of the Poor” contributed in important ways to buildingbridges with civil society.

Valuable contributions were made through other nonlending activities. These include capacity

building through the World Bank Institute (WBI) and environmental protection supported by Global
Environmental Facility (GEF) and Montreal Protocol (MP) projects. In particular, the W B I provided a
six-month capacity-building course in 200 1 with broad participation across six Latin American countries,
including Ecuador, to promote national anticorruption strategies. It also collaborated with an Ecuadorian
enterprise and local university that brought the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) to
Ecuador in 2001. Training was also provided to indigenous representatives on the Development
Gateway. The activities supported under Japanese and Norwegian grants for gender and indigenous
activities were discussed earlier. Finally, a range of GEF Medium Sized Projects totaling $3.5 million
were implemented successfully during the period, supporting such activities as wetlands conservation,
conservation o f fragile ecosystems in the Choco Andean region, the establishment of a socioenvironmental monitoring system in the Galapagos Islands, and recovering ancestral knowledge on water
and biodiversity conservation in semi-arid coastal areas. In November 2002, an $8 million GEF grant
was approved to strengthen protection of the National System of Protected Areas, and a $3.4 million MP
grant i s currently helping to reduce the industrial use o f ozone-depleting substances (ODs). Further work
will be required to mainstream GEF support, as has been done with an energy conservation GEF grant
related to an energy loan, Promec (Annex C).
The challenging economic environment precluded major IFC and MIGA support. In the case
66.
of the IFC, the priorities envisioned for FY00-02 were to (a) support existing clients; (b) support exportoriented projects, particularly in natural resources and agribusiness; (c) enhance the capabilities of
financial institutions in improving access to term financing; and (d) stimulate private sector investment in
infrastructure. The 2000 CAS Progress Report anticipated that IFC’s ability to invest in the financial and
infrastructure sectors would depend on progress in reforms and improvements in the regulatory
environment. During this period, political uncertainties and macroeconomic weakness continued, while
the closure of failed banks resulted in consolidation of the private banking sector. These factors
discouraged new private investment in Ecuador. Coupled with little progress in the regulatory
environment, these conditions presented the IFC with very limited investment opportunities. During the
period, the IFC continued to support i t s existing clients with good standing and export-orientation in
agribusiness. In February 2003, the IFC made a $15 million investment in support of the banana
exporting company, Favorita Fruit (Box 4). The IFC’s current held portfolio stands at $68 million
(including the recent $15 million investment), consisting of financings for seven companies in
agribusiness, manufacturing, infrastructure, and the financial sector.

MIGA’s outstanding guarantees portfolio in Ecuador consists o f four contracts of guarantee, with
67.
a US$37.1 million gross exposure, of which MIGA’s net exposure i s US$35.9 million. The total
estimated amount of FDI facilitated to date by MIGA in Ecuador i s US$352.1 million. I t s activities in the
country were fairly limited during the last CAS period, although MIGA currently has various active
applications for Ecuador in the infrastructure and power sectors. MIGA has also assisted Ecuador in i t s
FDI attraction activities. In June 2000, for example, the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) and MIGA jointly held a regional workshop on investment promotion for
representatives from the Andean Community member countries. Ecuador sent representatives from i t s
investment promotion agency to participate and discuss regional trends in FDI, and new initiatives in
investment promotion, and to begin discussions on cooperative regional arrangements for promotion.

Box 4. IFC Case Study-Support for Favorita Fruit Company
The Favorita Fruit Company (‘Favorita” or the Group) i s one of the leading banana producers and exporters in
Ecuador. The IFC has supported Favorita not only with critical long-term financing, but also with environmental
and social sustainability and corporate social responsibility (or CSR).
On the financing front, the IFC has provided Favorita with total financing o f US$45 million on three occasions since
1993. This consists of a US$15 million loan (including a US$5 million syndicated loan) financed for Reybanpac
(the Group’s banana plantation company) in 1993, a U S 1 5 million financing package (including a US$10 million
loan and a US$5 million equity investment) provided to the Group in 1998, and a US$15 million loan approved this
year. With these financings, the IFC helped Favorita expand to create a fully integrated production, packing, and
transport system, including development o f port facilities at Guayaquil, modernization and expansion o f i t s
cardboard box manufacturing plant, and acquisition and refurbishment o f banana plantations.
IFC also supported Favorita in achieving higher international standards in environmental and social measures
(including labor practices) and corporate governance, and extending such applicable standards to i t s independent
banana suppliers. Favorita has had a longstanding commitment in these areas. With IFC’s support, Favorita has
recognized that strengthening i t s practices in these areas has a positive impact not only on the society and the
economy but also on the firm’s market access, and thus an important element for long-term business success. In
coordination with the IFC, Favorita i s initiating a program to have i t s suppliers ECO-OK certified. The ECO-OK
certification i s an international qualification granted by the Sustainable Agriculture Network ( S A N ) , a coalition of
NGOs that includes the Rainforest Alliance. Such certification would enable Favorita to broaden its export market,
which i s increasingly sustainability-conscious. The activities on Favorita’s individual supplier farms to achieve
certification would range from elimination o f child labor practices and reforestation programs to construction of
solid waste and wastewater systems and pest management programs. Favorita i s committed to leading these efforts.
The IFC-administered Corporate Citizenship Facility has approved funding for this program.

The last CAS period presents several lessons for this CAS. Experience with regard to
68.
adjustment operations in Ecuador since the mid-1990s has shown that multi-tranche loans have run into
difficulties in later stages of execution, largely due to changing political circumstances that have quickly
eroded support for reforms. The lack o f success with multi-tranche operations was also pointed out in a
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review of the recently concluded S A L , which recommended singletranche lending in Ecuador’s case. To increase success in new policy-based lending, the Bank will follow
this recommendation and develop a series of single-tranche operations with all commitments met prior to
Board presentation. The investment portfolio benefited from joint World Bank-Ministry of FinancePresidency follow-up on project issues under the previous Administration, and from independent
prequalification processes for appointing technical staff of project coordination units. These modalities
will be continued over the next CAS period. In light of the difficulties in project execution caused by late
or inadequate transfers of counterpart funds, it will also be essential to reach agreement with Ecuadorian
officials during the budget planning process, and via quarterly reviews o f transfers, on adequate
counterpart funding of projects. The experience from the previous CAS period suggests that future AAA
w i l l benefit from securing, at an early stage, a broader support base to ensure interest as well as ownership
and support for any follow-up actions that could arise from the AAA. Finally, the Bank should continue
to build on positive experiences with an active dialogue with civil society.
The new CAS also takes into account recommendationsfrom the last OED Country Assistance
69.
Evaluation for Ecuador. The last Country Assistance Evaluation for Ecuador (Report No. 21825) was
prepared in 1999 and was presented to the Board by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in
January 2001. I t concluded that poverty reduction remains Ecuador’s main development challenge and
underscored the difficult external environment and lack of commitment to reform at different levels of
Ecuadorian society. It therefore cautioned the Bank against moving too quickly into a high lending
scenario on the basis of poorly defined or reversible triggers (Box 5).

21

Box 5. OED’s Country Assistance Evaluation of 2001 Recommended a New Approach to Assisting Ecuador

The 2001 OED Country Assistance Evaluation reviewed the Bank’s assistance program for the period FY94-98 and
concluded, among other things, that:
“The reduction o f poverty remains Ecuador’s main development challenge. Meeting it will require faster, laborintensive output growth, inclusion o f the poor (especially women) in the development process and more effective
targeting of social services.”
“Historically, adjustment lending has not been a successful instrument in Ecuador. This suggests that, at a
minimum, further quick-disbursing lending should be extended only when major reforms have reached the “sticky”,
hard-to-reversestage.”
“The experience of the past 16 years suggests the need for a new approach. A revised strategy might incorporate:
continued restructuring o f the existing portfolio; timely and high-quality nonlending services designed to build
wider societal support for reform; diminished reliance on quick-disbursing assistance to solve long-term institutional
and policy problems; small-scale, flexible lending targeted at grass-roots poverty and gender-oriented initiatives;
Adaptable Program Lending Loans (APLs) for poverty-oriented and sectoral reforms where strong borrower
commitment has been demonstrated; strengthened coordination with the IDB and the CAF; and reduced turnover
among Bank managers and staff to enhance project continuity.”

70.
This CAS takes into account OED’s recommendations in that the CAS was developed with
extensive consultations-as will be the case for projects under the CAS; nonlending AAA i s an integral
part of the assistance program beginning with a comprehensive set of Policy Notes, and the lending
program i s back-loaded in the CAS period. This CAS concurs with OED findings that the results of
earlier Structural Adjustment Loans ( S A L S ) have been disappointing-although the most recent S A L
achieved more than previous reform programs. The disappointments are attributable at least in part to the
use of a relatively inflexible multi-tranche instrument in a changing political environment. Therefore,
unlike in the past, and in line with QAG recommendations, adjustment lending in t h i s CAS will only be
via single-tranche loans based on prior actions, the initial S L s are small, and the S A L relationship i s
built up prudently over time if clear, nonreversible reforms are undertaken. These loans are accompanied
by a range of AAA activities, WBI activities and investment projects that support institutional and policy
reforms. The Bank has also approved i t s first Adaptable Program Loans (AF’Ls) for Ecuador-for rural
water. Finally, base and high case lending are contingent on meeting a firm set of triggers (Section IV.D).
B. Objectives of the 2003 Country Assistance Strategy

71.

The Government’s strategy i s to bring Ecuadorian citizens together to launch a concerted fight
against poverty, through coordinated advances on the economic and social fronts. On the economic front,
the Government’s strategy i s anchored around fiscal consolidation and comprises reforms to promote
competitiveness, improve basic infrastructure, strengthen financial markets, and create more flexible labor
markets. On the social front, the Government’s strategy i s to reform social assistance, education, health,
and social security to better fight poverty. This i s complemented by a sovereign and proactive
international policy and by a commitment to fight corruption and increase overall security, which i s
broadly defined to include judicial and environmental security.

72.
The Bank Group’s objective for this CAS i s to help the Government achieve these major results
by providing technical and financial assistance to (a) consolidate the macroeconomic framework and lay
the foundations for diversified and sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction; (b) increase
opportunities and broaden access to economic resources, and make the needed structural reforms socially
sustainable by mitigating the impacts on the poor and vulnerable; and (c) strengthen governance by
helping the Ecuadorian officials build an accountable and efficient government, the services of which are
accessible to all Ecuadorians.

22

C. Bank Group Program and Instruments

73.
This CAS takes a four-year, medium-term perspective o f Ecuador’s development, covering the
full term o f the present government through the change in Administration in 2007. During this period, a
CAS Progress Report w i l l be presented to the Board to update the strategy presented here. The Bank
Group’s technical and financial assistance in this period w i l l focus on promoting economic growth with
greater equity and improved governance (Tables 4 and 5). The effectiveness o f the Bank’s assistance
should be evaluated against these objectives. Annex B 9 sets out benchmarks agreed with the Government
to help monitor and evaluate the implementation o f the Bank Group’s assistance, many o f them aligned
with the Millennium Development Goals. These key objectives coincide with those o f other key
development partners, particularly the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), with whom the Bank i s
coordinating i t s assistance program closely (Section V.E).

74.
Fiscal discipline and consolidation are essential under dollarization, since the Government
cannot use monetary or exchange rate policy to influence economic behavior. Ecuador has had a
history o f fiscal indiscipline that can be ascribed to a legacy o f political exclusion. For example, with
regard to tax policy, a number o f “nuisance taxes” (costing more to collect than they effectively yielded to
Government) were created in response to particular needs, and exemptions were similarly granted to
particular groups. The limited tax collections after exemptions (only 6.3 percent o f GDP in 1996) were in
turn preassigned to specific groups, leaving limited resources for public goods provision and basic
infrastructure, which could indeed have benefited the entire population. Tax revenues are regressive, with
the main revenues coming from the value added tax and relatively limited collections coming from
income, property, and luxury taxes. On the spending side, social expenditures are also regressive, due to
generalized subsidies for products and services consumed more by wealthier families (for example, higher
education, fuel, cooking gas, water supply, telephony). Moreover, there has been considerable inertia in
budgeting, expenditures have not been sufficiently transparent, and they have rarely adjusted in a
significant way (and certainly not procyclically) in response t o highly volatile, oil-based revenues,
resulting in seignorage or in the accumulation o f debt acting as the adjustment variables. Thus, Ecuador’s
public sector debt has quadrupled since 1980, even as real GDP per capita has remained unchanged, and
inflation (which taxes the poor and middle class more than wealthier individuals who can better shelter
24

their incomes in hard currency) averaged close to 30 percent in the late 1990s. Finally, there has been
little incentive for local governments to collect taxes because they have received central government
transfers without corresponding spending or disclosure responsibilities.

75.
The Bank has prepared Policy Notes on the macrofiscal situation, debt administration, and tax
policy for the new Administration, and will be preparing a Public Expenditure Review jointly with the
IDB, as well as a Fiscal Decentralization and Debt Management Study. The FY02 Public Financial
Management Loan will build on earlier support under a State Modernization Project (MOSTA, Loan
3822-EC) to support increased transparency and accountability by consolidating and extending the
SIGEF. In light o f the importance of fiscal consolidation for the success of the Government’s program,
the Bank will support fiscal and debt management, tax reform, improved expenditure management,
revenue stabilization, reform in basic infrastructure services, and preservation of fiscal equilibrium
throughout the decentralization process under a three-part series of single-tranche, policy-based Fiscal
and Competitiveness Loans between now and FYO7.’ These loans will draw heavily on the
aforementioned AAA in their design.
76.
The Bank will also continue to support Ecuador’s efforts to increase competitiveness. Over the
past five years, a Bank-financed International Trade and Integration Project (Annex C) has supported
Ecuador’s efforts to shape a National Competitiveness Agenda, introduce a culture of quality (including
I S 0 ratings) among exporters, improve the country’s institutional framework for metrology, norm-setting,
and accreditation, and reduce impediments to industry and commerce in the form of bureaucratic delays
in business registrations, phytosanitary clearances, and technical barriers to trade. Still, Ecuador earns
low rankings in international ratings of competitiveness, due to impediments ranging from judicial
insecurity to bureaucracy to financial sector weakness and low adoption of technology. Indeed, Ecuador
has low patent applications and invests far less in research and development than the average for the
region (this i s an area in which the Bank and the IDB have tried to support progress in agricultural
research and in science and technology, respectively). I t also has important barriers to imports, lacks
antimonopoly legislation (last year a competition law drawn up with Bank project support and approved
by Congress was vetoed by the President), and faces severe constraints in domestic distribution networks
that prejudice small-scale entrepreneurs and consumers, in particular. It has only recently begun to
address important information technology constraints through a National Connectivity Agenda to bridge
the digital divide. And the costs of doing business remain high compared to other countries (Table 6).

The Bank w i l l provide analytical support to Government with a study o f Constraints to Growth,
an Investment Climate Assessment, and the Rural Development Strategy. In addition, the Bank will
support a Competitiveness project and a Rural Production project to address several of the above
constraints, together with the series o f Fiscal and Competitiveness Adjustment Loans, which will help
strengthen the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for competition. This work will be
coordinated closely with the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), and w i l l be complemented,
wherever feasible, by direct assistance to the private sector provided by the IFC and MIGA.
5. These loans constitute a program of support in fiscal and competitiveness areas. However, since the government has yet to
formulate detailed policies in certain key areas, such as decentralization or hydrocarbons, the Bank i s eschewing a
programmatic loan approach in these areas to be able to adjust the content o f later loans in the series to support key reforms.
In the social areas, the government has already determined a clear program o f reforms that the Bank intends to support with
three Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loans (PSALs) for social sector reform.

25

78.
As noted, the investment climate s t i l l remains difficult in Ecuador, and w i l l likely continue to
present I F C with limited opportunities for direct financing in the short term. Under these circumstances,
the IFC w i l l provide support where possible through selective use o f noninvestment and investment
instruments to help strengthen the Ecuadorian private sector. IFC’s priorities w i l l include (a)
management o f the portfolio; (b) assisting in promoting foreign private investment in Ecuador through the
Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS);6 (c) supporting the export sector, including the
hydrocarbon sector; and (d) supporting micro, small, and medium-sized businesses through technical
assistance or financing via intermediaries. IFC w i l l pursue these priorities with attention to impact on
employment, and better access to credit and technical training. As in the previous CAS period, IFC’s
investment opportunities w i l l continue to depend on progress in reform, improvement in the regulatory
framework, and macroeconomic and financial sector stability. Under the current macroeconomic and
financial sector conditions, IFC will continue to focus primarily on the management o f i t s portfolio and
opportunities for technical assistance activities, with selective investments that have likelihood o f
withstanding potential macro imbalances in such sectors as microfinance and export (including
hydrocarbons). As the macro framework and investment climate improve, I F C would look for
opportunities t o expand i t s activity in other areas. Currently IFC i s reviewing a possible loan to a
specialized institution providing commercial credit and other financial services to microenterprises. IFC
i s also undertaking an early-stage evaluation o f investment projects in the electricity and hydrocarbon
sectors.
The Bank Group will continue to support financial sector strengthening. The Government’s
79.
aim i s to promote a robust, deep, liquid, competitive, integrated, and profitable financial sector that i s
capable o f resisting the shocks that can arise in an open dollarized economy that i s also vulnerable to
natural disasters. Key challenges in the banking sector w i l l be t o improve the interbank payments system;
clearance and settlement mechanisms, including real-time gross settlements for large value transactions;
an effective central registry that can facilitate scripless trading and ensure delivery versus payment; and a
functional liquidity support mechanism and a credible deposit insurance scheme. In addition, banking
supervision needs to be strengthened further, including in the areas o f risk management (with the phased
application o f Basle 1 and 2 guidelines) and o f anti-money -laundering vigilance, while effective bank
resolution mechanisms need to be put in place, including for the resolution o f the last banking crisis,
which so far has cost the State an estimated 20 percent o f GDP. Moreover, alternative financial services
through credit and savings cooperatives, microfinance providers, finance companies, insurance
companies, pension funds, and capital markets need t o be developed considerably t o complement
Ecuador’s banks. Finally, i t w i l l be important t o enhance corporate governance to reduce risks for
creditors and minority shareholders and to attract greater investment in the Ecuadorian enterprise sector.
The Bank w i l l continue to provide technical and financial support in the banking sector, in coordination
with the CAF, IDB, IMF, and the USAID, through i t s ongoing Financial Sector TA loan, a joint BankFund Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) evaluation, additional financial sector advisory
services, a project to promote greater access t o financial services for the poor, and a Financial Sector
Review at the close o f the period t o evaluate the progress made.
The Government has requested Bank assistance in labor and civil service reforms. The Bank
80.
prepared a Policy Note for the new Administration o n labor and c i v i l service issues that identified serious
challenges related to labor market flexibility, wage adjustment processes that do not reflect productivity,
and heavy use o f outsourcing as a second-best solution to direct employment (outsourcing contributes
importantly to labor flexibility but denies workers employee rights). In the case o f the public sector,
wages have increased significantly with n o downsizing in the number o f employees and n o perceptible
increase in productivity, placing a major strain o n the fisc. These issues are being addressed in part by the
Government in the Letter o f Development Policy that accompanies the adjustment operations presented
for the Board’s consideration with this CAS, to which end the Government has requested immediate
6. FIAS has offered to conduct diagnostic and other studies on the competitive environment.

26

technical support from Bank staff in the design of reforms. The Bank’s analytical support will be
complemented by an Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) that will in turn feed into an
Institutional Reform Loan that i s expected to focus on strengthening the quality of public services,
including through civil service reforms, together with measures to be adopted under the series of Fiscal
Consolidation and Competitive Growth Loans. WBI assistance on consensus building would complement
these efforts.
81.
Ecuador depends heavily on oil, but has not availed itself of this resource to its full potential,
nor has it put in place best practice safeguards against environmental damage or social consequences.
The Bank has played a limited role in the hydrocarbons sector in recent years. On the other hand, i t s
assistance has been strategic. Through an Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP)
Grant, the Bank has provided support for training indigenous communities to negotiate on an informed
basis with prospective oil investors, while a Bank-supported Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant
has facilitated a two-year participatory process to develop regulations in line with legal and constitutional
requirements-and with international commitments with the International Labour Office (LO)-to
ensure adequate consultation processes in the case of investments in ancestral indigenous lands and
environmentally sensitive areas. These regulations were promulgated via Presidential Decree in
December 2002. Most recently, a Bank Policy Note on hydrocarbons has pointed out important sources
of inefficiency in oil refinement that could be resulting in enormous economic losses to the State.
Looking ahead, it will be important for the Govemment to consider a five-point program of reform to
promote the sector in an environmentally and socially sustainable way by (a) redefining the role o f
Petroecuador, ending i t s monopoly; (b) creating opportunities for best practice private investment in the
sector, both upstream and downstream; (c) reviewing taxation and pricing policies; (d) improving the
management of environmental and social impacts, ensuring that Ecuador does not lag behind other oilproducing countries in this regard, but rather consistently applies international best practices in the
industry; and (e) improving management, administration, and pansparency related to oil rents. The Bank
i s currently providing joint technical assistance with the IDB and CAF to help the Government redress the
immediate problem of significant economic losses in Petroecuador’s refineries.
82.
The new Administration i s s t i l l formulating i t s policies for the broader hydrocarbons sector,
although it has repeatedly emphasized the importance of attracting private investment into the sector.
Once the Government has conducted i t s review and determined its policies for the sector, i t s level o f
commitment to an oil sector reform that embraces the above areas-notably best practice environmental
safeguards and social participation-will be a critical trigger for determining the scope for Bank technical
assistance to help reform the sector. In a similar manner, potential IFC investment in hydrocarbons will
depend critically on the legal and regulatory framework, and on the sector’s (particularly PetroEcuador’s)
application of international best practice environmental and social safeguards, and assistance by the Bank
or other institutions in these areas. Inthe interim, the Bank i s planning to develop a second ESMAP grant
to strengthen training for indigenous communities on the newly approved consultation regulations, and i s
working with the Govemment to support the implementation of the new consultation guidelines as part of
the series of Fiscal Consolidation and Competitive Growth Loans.
83.
The electricity sector has gone through an incomplete reform process since 1996. While
previous Bank and IDB assistance has helped to separate electricity generation, transmission, and
distribution functions and put in place a wholesale energy market regulated by the National Electricity
Council (CONELEC) and efficiently managed by the National Center for Energy Control (CENACE), the
reforms have been incomplete. The national Solidarity Fund and local government owners of distribution
companies have failed to upgrade their management, permitting average losses o f one-third o f energy
generated, due to a combination o f distribution losses and insufficient bill collection. This has created
persistent deficits in payments to generators, which resulted in the nonpayment o f debt to the national
government and insufficient investment in operations and maintenance by generators, and has in turn
discouraged private participation in generation. Despite this problematic environment, there have been

21

recent additions to supply capacity which have reduced reliance on old and costly thermal generation: a
private sector gas-fired plant and a transmission line capacity upgrade t o increase imports o f electricity
from C ~ l o m b i a .The
~ cash generation deficiency o f the power sector must be nevertheless addressed. In
the light o f a failed attempt to privatize electricity distribution over the past two years and the continued
opposition to privatization o f state assets, the new Administration i s adjusting tariffs to economic costs
and exploring options for private participation through management contracts in the distribution sector as
an incentive to encourage private investment in electricity generation, and as a way to quickly improve
the efficiency o f electricity distribution. Genuine reforms in the sector t o mobilize badly needed private
investment and achieve sustainable efficiency improvements w i l l require considerable political
commitment.
84.
The Government has developed a strategy t o reduce the financial deficit and improve the
efficiency o f the electricity sector, which would entail the following key elements: trust fund mechanism
to ensure timely payment t o generators (as proved essential for the new private sector players); resolution
o f the challenges facing Emelec, the Guayaquil distribution utility; debt restructuring for all governmentowned companies in the sector; and a medium-term strategy for sustainable efficiency improvements in
distribution and private investment in the sector. The Bank, in turn, approved a project in 2001 to
modernize electricity and telecommunications services in rural areas (Promec), which i s assisting with the
regulatory framework, particularly in the wholesale market, and with electrification for poor rural and
infra-urban households, as well as complementary GEF support for energy conservation and small power
generation projects using small renewable energy sources-although the Bank will not engage in major
infrastructure investments in t h i s area. The Promec project has a major social outreach component to
build understanding and support for deeper reforms.
85.
The telecommunications sector also requires further private investment to improve quality and
coverage. Fixed-line telephony i s presently monopolized b y three state-owned enterprises that have
provided poor-quality service (48 breakdowns per 100 lines in 2000) at subsidized rates (about half the
cost per minute o f neighboring countries) to a select few (coverage i s limited t o under 15 lines per 100
inhabitants). The government has attracted private investors into wireless local loop and cellular phone
services in recent years, but competition i s s t i l l weak in these areas, affecting prices and quality o f
service. The regulatory framework for telecommunications remains t o be strengthened, including via
consolidation o f the four regulatory agencies, and further private investment i s required to ensure
sufficient competition and improve quality and coverage. The Promec project together with the series o f
Fiscal and Competitiveness Loans w i l l help strengthen the regulatory framework over the next several
years, and subsidize extension o f coverage to rural and poor infra-urban households.
86.
Maintenance of national highways has improved over the past four years, but secondary and
feeder roads need substantial upgrading. Progress on improving the quality o f highways has been
greatest in the case o f concessions to private operators, which supports the view that the Public Works
Ministry should steadily transform itself into a more regulatory Ministry o f Transport. The CAF has
taken the lead in supporting highway construction-the Bank w i l l not provide support in this area, or in
the area of ports and airports. On the other hand, the IDB and the Bank are jointly preparing a Rural
Roads project focused in the poorest provinces and based on provincial-level planning processes. The
project should encourage jobs in microenterprise and cooperative road maintenance and transport
companies, and open up marginalized areas to the national market and improve access to social services.
87.
The water and sanitation sector is characterized by low levels of coverage, particularly in rural
areas, by poor service quality, and by the inefficiency of urban service providers. In addition, low cost
recovery through tariffs has made water and sanitation service providers highly dependent o n transfers
from national and municipal governments and has deprived them o f the operational revenues needed to

extend coverage to the unserved poor. In peri-urban areas, poor populations not connected to the water
supply network often spend 20 times as much buying water from tanker trucks as their neighbors who are
connected to the formal network. In rural areas, poor, unserved households spend hours each day
collecting water o f dubious quality from streams and ponds. The Bank has supported extension of water
supply services through the first phase of i t s Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation
Adaptable Program Loan (APL), Praguas, designed to reach 360,000 rural inhabitants, and through i t s
Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Development Project, Prodepine. A second APL for Praguas i s planned
to begin late in the CAS period, and will be supported by commitments under adjustment loans, with a
view to deepening policy reforms; developing performance-based transfer mechanisms for allocating
central government transfers; preparing a new Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Sector Law to clarify
the regulatory framework; and supporting new and rehabilitated water and/or sanitation services for about
980,000 people in rural areas. This will be complemented by IDB support for water and sanitation in
larger and medium-sized cities, and by an urban poverty-reduction project scheduled for FY05, which
will among other things address urban drainage and flood control issues of critical importance to the poor.

Broadening Access to Resources and EnsuringReforms Are Socially Sustainable

88.
A key underlying reason for the widespread poverty in Ecuador today is the lack of adequate
social inclusion. There are s t i l l wide gaps in income levels and in unmet basic needs between the whitemestizo population and the indigenous or Afro population. Indeed, while indigenous organizations have
carved out a growing political role over the past decade, the Afro population continues to be poorly
organized and largely invisible (Box 6). There are also large gaps in access to resources between urban
and rural populations and between men and women. Therefore, ethnic, spatial, and gender considerations
need to be built into policy and project designs in a consistent way to ensure access for the poorest, and in
the particular case o f indigenous populations, it i s essential to take into account cultural values tied to
ancestral traditions that may differ from those of the majority population. Together with the International
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the European Union, the Bank has attempted to promote
improved access to financial capital and to productive and social capital in poorer rural communities
through the Prolocal and Prodepine projects. A second Prodepine project, specifically targeted at and
designed by and for indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities, i s planned for the CAS. This would
be complemented by a capacity-building program for indigenous leaders in all five Andean countries,
with support from the WBI and the Development Gateway Foundation, to promote strategic participatory
planning and access to information technology, and WBI assistance to enhance negotiation skills for
indigenous peoples. Moreover, both to increase social inclusion and to build broader support for reforms,
WBI i s also considering capacity-enhancement programs in the areas of consensus building, strategic
planning with communities, governance and community empowerment, the role of parliament and civil
society in pro-growth policy design, access to information, and monitoring and evaluation o f governance
and public services. Finally, the Bank i s considering AAA support for out-of-school youth to promote
youth development and social inclusion.
89.
Improved education is widely considered in Ecuador to be the country’s top development
priority. Not only are Ecuador’s education expenditures relative to GDP below average for the region,
but they are also distributed primarily to salaries (86 percent), with virtually no resources for didactic
materials, school maintenance, or investment in new infrastructure. There are underused resources in the
sector, insofar as studendteacher ratios are low by regional standards and repeater rates are high. Also,
absenteeismi s notorious in rural single-teacher schools and greater accountability and local autonomy are
important challenges s t i l l to be addressed. In response to the priorities expressed by civil society (Annex
E), the Bank has included support for this important sector in the CAS via both AAA and lending,
building on earlier AAA completed in 2003. Education reforms will also be supported through a series of
three, single-tranche Programmatic Social Adjustment Loans designed to promote reforms in the social
sectors (education, health, social assistance, and pensions), which complements the series of three Fiscal
and Competitiveness Loans. The Bank‘s objective i s to support expanded coverage o f basic education

29

(grades 0 to lo), ensure adequate access t o quality bilingual education particularly for indigenous children
while piloting assistance to promote functional literacy among indigenous women, and support efforts to
strengthen governance and accountability in the sector with a view to improving quality. I t i s also hoped
that improved educational quality and coverage will help to reduce the high youth unemployment rates.

Box 6. Ecuadorians of African Descent Are Largely Invisible in Society

There are between 500,000 and 1 million Ecuadorians o f African descent, and they are concentrated in the coastal
provinces o f Guayas and Esmeraldas and in the Chota-Mira Valley north o f Quito. In urban settings, AfroEcuadorians live in extremely poor neighborhoods with deficient public services, limited employment opportunities,
and restricted possibilities for developing small business. In rural and coastal settings, they frequently share
communities with other ethnic groups and depend on forest-, agriculture-, and marine-based subsistence activities
for their livelihoods.
In a society characterized by ethnic and cultural diversity, Ecuadorians o f African descent are largely
invisible. Official disaggregated data about the population and their living conditions are scarce; public investment
in their geographical areas of concentration i s very low. Their national and community organizations lack political
clout or even broad recognition. Their contributions to the economic, social, and cultural identity o f the country are
underestimated and seldom recognized, and the barrier o f prejudice has yet to be fully overcome. As a result, AfroEcuadorians have not been able to reap the benefits o f the development processes o f the country, nor has Ecuador
benefited fully from the knowledge, skills, and imagination of this community.

~

I

Breaking this vicious circle o f poverty, exclusion, and isolation involves assertive actions to create official
and local spaces where the community can voice their concerns and be heard, and where their local development
activities gain legitimacy and acknowledgement. This will require making Afro-Ecuadorians visible in population
information-gathering instruments; supporting locally based participatory models o f development planning,
management, and evaluation; directing more resources to urban and rural communities with high concentrations o f
Afro-Ecuadorians (as do, for example, the Bank-supported projects Prodepine and Prolocal-see Annex C), and
strengthening official institutions mandated to represent and safeguard the well-being o f the community, notably the
recently established Afro-Ecuadorian Development Corporation (CODAEi).
90.
Ecuador’s low public expenditures on health, and shortcomings in health coverage result in a
high incidence of preventable diseases and deaths. Ecuador has made important progress toward key
M i l l e n n i u m Development Goals during the past decade: for example infant mortality and maternal
mortality rates declined by about one-third during the 199Os, putting Ecuador halfway toward the goals o f
two-thirds reductions in these indicators by 2015. There i s also a strong commitment to malaria and
dengue control, as evinced by frequent vector control campaigns particularly in the Costa, and Congress
has approved a Free Motherhood L a w t o improve maternal health. On the other hand, more than twothirds o f the population do not have formal health insurance, and the out-of-pocket cost o f health
treatment i s highest f o r the poorest citizens, so that fully one-third of Ecuadorians postpone or do not seek
formal health treatment. Moreover, child vaccinations have slipped back from 90 percent to 80 percent of
children, increasing exposure t o preventable illnesses. Uneven health coverage translates into sharp
differences in l i f e expectancy at birth, which ranges from 75 years f o r inhabitants of Pichincha province
surrounding Quito to 65 years in the poorest highland province, Chimborazo, and only 60 years in the
Amazon. The health problems are accentuated by problems with inadequate nutrition and lack of access
to safe water, which correlate closely with inadequate access t o health services.

9 1.
The Bank w i l l develop a Health Insurance Study for the Andes countries, beginning in Ecuador in
Ey04, to study effective and affordable ways of achieving universal basic health insurance in the future.
This study w i l l pave the way f o r a planned Health and Social Security Project. In addition, the Bank’s
planned Programmatic Social Adjustment Lending would support steps to link coverage under the Free

Motherhood L a w and the rural social security system (Seguro Social Campsino), as a f i r s t step t o
extending coverage to the most needy. These efforts build o n the ongoing Health Modernization Project,
Modersa, which i s supporting decentralization of health services, and strengthening o f the legal and
regulatory framework for the sector.
30

92.
Ecuador’s pension system has been strengthened by an Intervention Commission since 1998.
Whereas the Ecuadorian Social Security Institute (IESS), which provides both pension and medical
benefits, had been close to bankruptcy and had operated for several years without published financial
accounts, the Commission strengthened management of the IESS, brought accounts up to date, reduced
cross-subsidies across benefit schemes, and presented a Social Security reform law to Congress that
would have set up a three-pillar pension system. On the other hand, the law has not been applied due to
questions on key items raised by the Constitutional Tribunal, and benefits are not coordinated with the
bono solidario social assistance program, which in fact covers more senior citizens than the social
security system. Accounting and investment policies need to be strengthened further, as do actuarial
valuations and oversight of the IESS. The Bank has begun to study these areas through i t s Policy Notes.
The planned Programmatic Social Adjustment Loans and Health and Social Security project would
support further reforms to strengthen and deepen social security coverage.
Ecuador has a range of social assistanceprograms but these are not well coordinated to ensure
93.
comprehensive, well-targeted coverage of the most vulnerable groups. Ecuador has close to 20 social
assistance programs; however, their coverage, targeting, and impact have not been adequately monitored.
The most important program, the bono solidario, i s among the best-targeted social program for the poor
in Ecuador, and reaches about 1.2 million female heads of household. Currently, the SELBEN database
set up to ensure means-testing of beneficiaries i s being reviewed with IDB support to improve targeting,
and the Bank w i l l assist this process with poverty mapping through i t s ongoing Poverty Assessment
AAA, paying particular attention to marginalized groups, including indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian
communities. The Bank recommends increasing the flexibility o f the social assistance programs by
developing an anticyclical program like public workfare, or designing an anticyclical component in the
safety net, such as a mechanism to increase the beneficiaries of some programs during times of crisis, or
automatic increases in social assistance programs during such times. In addition, the Bank has proposed
that the bono solidario be transformed into a conditional cash transfer program to protect the health of
children and pregnant women, improving i t s targeting mechanism, and evaluating i t s impact. Again,
these issues will be taken up through the programmatic lending.

94.
Poverty, while deeper in rural areas, increased significantly in urban areas with the crisis. Six
out of 10 Ecuadorians now live in urban areas. This i s below the average for Latin America but i s rising
rapidly. Moreover, whereas before the 1999 crisis, one-third of the poor lived in urban areas, after the
crisis t h i s number had risen to 48 percent, both because of rural-urban migration and because of the lack
o f coping mechanisms and greater vulnerability to downswings in income with the loss of employment.
Urban property rights are frequently poorly defined, and living conditions and overcrowding in slum
areas are particularly worrisome for Guayaquil and certain secondary cities. The solutions for urban
compared to rural poverty will need to be different, because income and consumption poverty are
relatively greater concerns in urban areas, while unmet basic needs are more pressing in rural areas. After
focusing predominantly on rural poverty during the previous CAS, the Bank will begin to take up urban
poverty issues in an urban poverty reduction project under the new CAS.
95.
The depth of rural poverty will continue to motivate intensive Bank support for rural poverty
alleviation. Agriculture accounts for 11percent o f GDP, continues to be one of the key export earners for
Ecuador, and i s the primary source of income for Ecuador’s (40 percent) rural population.’ Yet i t i s
characterized by challenges all along the production chain, from fragmented land, irregular land titling,
and frustrated land reform, workers with limited opportunities for developing their skills or education,
limited irrigation and poor watershed management, distorted input markets, low productivity, limited
diversification, high vulnerability to natural disasters, insufficient quality control, weak postharvest
conservation practices, severe limitations in marketing and market access, and volatile commodity prices.
There has also been little attention to rural nonfarm production. The Bank i s recommending a “rural

revealed that one-third o f agricultural producers’ incomes derives from nonfarm sources o f income.

31

space” development approach in i t s ongoing rural development study, which i s a precursor to a future
rural productivity and sustainable development operation to address constraints along the entire chain.
This assistance addresses a key priority identified in the CAS consultations (Annex E) and builds on the
positive results achieved in the Agricultural Research and Agricultural Census projects to promote
increased knowledge in the agricultural sector. The new loan would be complemented by assistance to
rural indigenous and Afro communities via the proposed follow-on to Prodepine and the ongoing rural
poverty-alleviation project, Prolocal, both of which will also continue to provide support for rural finance
through components that are cofinanced respectively by IFAD and the EuropeanUnion.

In broadening access to resources, it will be important to ensure that natural resources are also
96.
conserved for future generations. There are important linkages between poverty and environmental
degradation. First, rural poverty can lead to exploitation of increasingly unsuitable lands, leading to
accelerated deforestation or conversion of highland pcirumo, which act as catchment areas for water.
Similarly, inadequate attention to brown and green environmental issues can cause increased infectious
respiratory diseases, water-borne illnesses, and vector-borne diseases. The Bank will continue to play an
important role in overseeing GEF-funded projects, particularly when the large Biodiversity I1Grant for
the National Protected Areas System becomes effective this year, and to t h i s end it will prepare a GEF
country strategy with the Government. The strategy could include future GEF support for planning
related to climate change. In addition, the Bank proposes to undertake an environmental review as a
precursor to a Natural Resources Management operation in the later stages of the CAS program.
Strengthening Governance to Ensure Accountable, Efficient, and Accessible Public Services
97.
A just and efficient economic and social program needs to be founded on good governance.
Detailed surveys indicate that the issue of corruption i s of considerable concern to Ecuadorian citizens
and affects their daily lives. Corruption i s shown in cross-country studies to be associated with worse
rather than better service, to impact the poor disproportionately in the allocation of public resources, and
to increase public disaffection with the polity. As Ecuador went through i t s severe crises between
1997/98 and 2000/01, the trend of most measures of governance was toward worsening performance,
including of such indicators as accountability, political stability, government efficacy, regulatory
capacity, rule o f law, and control of corruption. While i t i s likely that new evidence will point to a halt in
the downward trend since 2000, the Government has made improving governance and reducing
corruption one of i t s key priorities.
98.
To achieve these goals, it i s essential that the Government take the lead in improving governance.
To do so, the Government will need to identify the institutional strengths and weaknesses of the public
sector. This will allow i t to isolate the underlying causes for inadequacies in public services and the
prevalence o f corruption, and enable it to develop a program with monitorable indicators to address these
issues. This will require considerable political leadership and long-term commitment to mobilize broad
support for specific reforms, such as introducing performance standards for public services, reforming
public procurement and financial management practices, increasing accountability and transparency in
public resource allocations, pursuing civil service reforms, and on one hand improving legal protection
for public officials who attempt to enforce laws and regulations while on the other hand pursuing cases of
gross negligence or bad faith in public service.
Improvements in governance are a key area for Bank Group support, because they are
99.
fundamental to achieving sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The Bank Group will bring a
series of instruments to bear in this area in a coordinated manner. These include a Public Expenditure
Review, which will be conducted jointly with the IDB; the Bank’s f i r s t Institutional and Governance
Review (IGR) for Ecuador; an investment climate assessment; a procurement review (CPAR) and a
financial assessment (CFAA), which the Bank’s financial management team plans to launch as early as
FY04, in collaboration with the IDB and IMF. In order to ensure synergies, these AAA instruments will

32

be carefully sequenced, and will be coordinated with WBI capacity-building and diagnostic work
designed to help Government assess the institutional strengths and weaknesses, and improve the quality
of public services. In addition, the Bank will promote increased transparency and accountability through
a range of proposed loan operations, whether sector-specific such as rural water supply (Praguas) or
electricity and telecommunications (Promec), or overarching loans, such as the Public Financial
Management Loan approved by the Board in 2002 to consolidate and extend SIGEF, and a proposed
Institutional Reform Loan, which would be designed using AAA and W B I inputs described above, and
the program o f adjustment loans and proposed support for judicial reform. These planned activities also
build on earlier work by the Bank, including diagnostic and capacity-building work on corruption by the
WBI during 1999-2001, and the State Modernization Project (MOSTA, L.3822-EC, closed March 2001),
which among other activities helped Government begin to develop and roll out SIGEF.
100. Awareness has grown in the legal and judicial community about the need for an effective,
efficient, and transparent legal and judicial system. There i s also greater demand for such a system
from the general public, and the Government continues to make legal and judicial reform a priority.
Some of the main challenges include access to justice for the poor, delays in dispute resolution, and the
perception of a lack of transparency. The Chief Justice, through the Supreme Court and the Judicial
Council, i s leading an effort to develop a comprehensive plan reflecting specific priorities and sequencing
with stakeholders and a program to scale up successful pilot projects. In this context, efforts should be
made to (a) strengthen the legal framework supporting judicial independence; (b) develop a
comprehensive plan to improve legal and judicial training o f judges, lawyers, and court clerks; (c)
introduce legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms to combat corruption; (d) improve access to justice,
notably for women and for poorer Ecuadorians, through further institutional and legal reform; and (e)
encourage public participation in future reform efforts. The process of legal and judicial reform i s long
term. The Bank began i t s support for t h i s area in Ecuador in 1996 with a first Judicial Reform Loan that
computerized, restructured and greatly increased the efficiency of one-fifth of Ecuador’s civil and penal
courts of first instance, as well as promoting mediation as an alternative to judicial settlements, and access
to justice for the poor and for women. The 2003 judicial sector review and planned second judicial
reform loan build on the earlier work to address the issues indicated above.

101. Finally, the Bank undertook a decentralization study in F Y O O that formed the basis for dialogue
with the previous Administration on this topic. Decentralization i s a politically sensitive issue and
progress i s difficult, because Ecuador has multiple layers o f government and has yet to establish transfer
principles embodying clear responsibilities and appropriate incentives. The new Administration i s
evaluating policy options, and the Bank w i l l take up the dialogue again, updating i t s AAA in this CAS
period through a fiscal decentralization and debt management study, which will inform both the proposed
adjustment loans and the dialogue with the Government and the general public, in coordination with other
donors such as the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the USAID.
D. Lending Scenarios and Triggers
102.
The base case scenario o f the CAS will have an envelope of up to $1,050 million during FY0407 with an average of four operations per year (Table 7), as well as $100 million t h i s fiscal year to

provide immediate support to the new Administration’s stabilization and reform program. The higher
base case envelope relative to past lending responds to improved performance by Ecuador, which has
improved i t s fiscal balance while increasing social expenditures, adopted fiscal responsibility legislation,
and reduced debt-to-GDP ratios to below 60 percent, with a further decline to 40 percent projected over
the next five years in the base case. Ecuador’s new Government has also demonstrated early on i t s
readiness to implement unpopular measures if needed to stabilize the economy and promote fiscal
consolidation, which it recognizes as essential for sustainable long-term growth. The planned CAS
program enables the Bank to seize the current window of opportunity, but carefully hedges against the
important risks by building up the relationship over time, and only if CAS performance triggers are met.

Note *: Amounts associatedwith adjustment lending become available only if prior actions
to the programmedoperations are met.

103. Under the base case, adjustment lending would be limited to $100 million per year, all through
single-tranche loans based on fulfillment of actions prior to Board presentation. The Bank envisions a
self-regulating mechanism for adjustment loans, insofar as the lending envelope i s reduced if the prior
actions for the loans are not met. The adjustment loans would support reform programs designed to
ensure fiscal consolidation, promote competitiveness, and improve the quality and efficacy o f social
expenditures. Investment lending would be 50 percent or more of new Bank lending, and would increase
from a base o f $100 million by $50 million per year until FY06, and remain constant in FY07, which
coincides with the next general election.
104. Under a high case scenario, the ceiling for new Bank lending could increase by up to $50 million
per year. The Bank envisions two circumstances in which Ecuador might move to a high case scenario,
involving heightened performance in structural programs in both cases, but different states of the world.
In the first case, severe adverse external shocks coupled with strong efforts to implement reforms could
justify expanded Bank support for Ecuador, in light o f the country’s limited access to private capital
markets. Inthe second case, with a more benign external environment and accelerated structural reforms,
including improvements in governance and financial management, the lending envelope could be
increased and a greater share could be provided through adjustment loans to support the general budget,
although t h i s share would never exceed 50 percent of the envelope. Both of these circumstances are more
likely to arise in the later rather than the earlier years of the CAS period.
105. Under a low case scenario, there would be no new adjustment lending and the number and value
o f investment loans would be reduced and focused on direct poverty alleviation, so that lending would not
exceed 50 percent of the base case lending scenario in the low case. In the event o f a low case scenario
brought on by major and severe exogenous shocks in which the economic reform program becomes
clearly unviable, irrespective o f the Government’s will to enact reforms, Bank Management would seek
the Board’s guidance through a CAS Progress Report. The triggers for the various lending scenarios are
presented in Table 8.

E. Partnerships and Selectivity

106. The Bank’s assistance program is designed to address essential reforms required under
dollarization and to respond to priorities expressed by Government and civil society. The Bank‘s
program envisions two complementary sets o f adjustment loans. The fiscal and competitiveness series
addresses the fundamental issue o f consolidating Ecuador’s fiscal position and removing impediments to
ensure that Ecuador can compete effectively under dollarization and in the context o f a forthcoming
American Free Trade Area. The programmatic social series addresses the fundamental issues o f ensuring
that the essential structural reforms are socially sustainable, b y supporting improvements in the
effectiveness and coverage o f key social programs. The investment lending portfolio responds to key
priorities repeatedly expressed in consultation processes, thereby increasing local ownership o f projects
considerably, for example, supporting education, health, competitiveness, productivity o f agriculture, and
viable nonfarm rural activities, and financial services for the poor. The design o f Bank projects has also
changed in response to civil society recommendations, with considerably greater local participation in the
design and allocation o f subproject resources (as in the Prodepine, Prolocal, Praguas, and Promec
projects-see Annex C-and the forthcoming rural roads project). The AAA pipeline i s carefully
sequenced and closely tied to the lending program, covering core Bank studies, sectoral reviews that pave

35

the way for better-designed lending (for example, education, rural development, environment, and
financial services), and studies that address specific constraints and needs identified by Government and
that are expected to have a major impact, such as hydrocarbons, labor markets, health insurance, and an
institutional and governance review. The planned W B I program supports the Bank’s efforts to build
capacity in key governance and social areas. The IFC and MIGA support will strengthen the
competitiveness o f private sector partners. The overall Bank Group assistance program i s focused on
areas in which the Bank Group has historically counted on considerable in-house expertise.

107. In the event of a significant deterioration in economic conditions, the Bank would restructure i t s
investment portfolio toward poverty reduction by, for example, refocusing and bringing forward the
proposed health project and the proposed rural production project, while emphasizing the urban povertyreduction project. Similarly, on the AAA side, the Bank would likely advance the nutrition review and
ensure that timely poverty monitoring information i s available.
108. Implementation of the Bank’s program requires close coordination with strategic partners,
including the CAF, IDB, IMF, the United Nations system, and bilateral donors. The Government’s
economic reform program establishes an overall framework of macroeconomic targets and policy reforms
that has received IMF support through a $205 million-equivalent, 13-month Stand-By Arrangement
approved on March 21, 2003. Provided performance i s solid under the program, i t i s expected that the
IMF will continue i t s technical and financial support to Ecuador beyond the current Arrangement.
109. The design of the Bank‘s assistance program builds on the Fund Arrangement and recognizes
several areas in which other donors have a comparative advantage and/or are providing important ongoing
assistance. For example, the CAF has a record of significant investment in major infrastructure in
Ecuador and, jointly with the IDB, i s promoting interconnectivity of transport, electricity, and other
networks among Andean nations, and taking the lead on natural disaster management. The IDB has taken
the lead on the issue of reforming public banks, rural finance, defining property rights, and the social
investment fund. The IDB and the Bank are presently developing mutually reinforcing programmatic
loans in the social areas, in which both institutions have played leading roles. The United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has played a major role in monitoring social expenditures and in working
toward a fiscal contract within civil society (pacto social yfiscal). The GTZ and USAID are playing key
roles in advancing municipal development in the context of decentralization. Similarly, while there are
important issues related to border development, particularly on the northern border with Colombia,
bilateral donors are providing community-level grant funding to address needs in these areas. On the
other hand, the Bank i s likely to continue playing a leading role in financial sector development (with a
focus on strengthening the banking sector), institutional reforms in the public sector, human development
(in particular at t h i s time in the health sector), and rural poverty reduction. I t i s not expected to finance
large-scale infrastructure operations.

110. Donor coordination is improving in Ecuador. The Ecuadorian Institute for International
Cooperation (INECI), in the Ministry of External Affairs has joined the Ministry of Finance in playing an
important role in promoting coordination among donors. The Bank Office in Ecuador has actively
supported these initiatives by, for example, chairing the donor coordination group on reducing extreme
poverty and promoting the interchange o f information structured along CDF lines on planned donor
assistance for the next four years (see Annex G for areas o f emphasis of each donor). Moreover, there i s
strong collaboration among the multilateral agencies (CAF, IDB, W, and the World Bank) at the local
level to present a coordinated position on several policy issues. The Bank, CAF, the IDB, and UNDP are
also coordinating to improve multilateral responses and prevention activities related to natural disasters.
The IDB, which i s historically Ecuador’s largest creditor, and the Bank have identified very similar
priorities for the next four years as part o f their respective country strategies, and are coordinating closely
across a range of issues, beginning with a joint Public Expenditure Review. The IDB program i s
highlighted in Box 7.

The IDB’s Country Strategy for 2003-06 i s likely to be presented to the IDB Board o f Directors in June 2003, and
to identify the following three major development challenges for Ecuador:
(1) Strengthening governance, particularly via institutional development, transparency, and organized
decentralization processes.
(2) Structural reforms and increased competitiveness, particularly through reforms in the judicial sector,
public finances, financial and labor markets, pension and capital markets, and investment promotion with
environmental conservation.
(3) Poverty alleviation and social safety nets, including through social inclusion programs, human
development, targeting o f subsidies, and small-scale rural infrastructure.
IDB Management i s likely to propose a lending program o f about $600 million for 2003-06, o f which $200
million would be policy-based lending in the social areas. I t s investment portfolio will focus on rural roads, coastal
resource management, strengthening the rural social security system (Seguro Social Campsino), and developing
rural finance. Other possible areas are municipal development, science and technology, and urban transport. The
IDB i s currently by far Ecuador’s largest creditor, with outstanding loans o f $1.99 billion, equivalent to 50 percent
o f multilateral debt and 17 Dercent o f total Dublic external debt.

CAS P R O G R A M MONITORING
AND R I S K S

A. Managing the Existing Portfolio
111. Performance of the Ecuador portfolio has improved significantly since the FYOO CAS Progress
Report was discussed by the Board. At end-ROO, the portfolio had 15 active projects, o f which six were
classified as At Risk, representing 30 percent of total commitments (see Table 9). Only one project was
classified as unsatisfactory. As of April 1, 2003, the portfolio consisted of 12 active projects, o f which
t w o were classified as At Risk, representing only 9.4 percent of total commitments. Moreover,
performance of projects that closed in the previous five fiscal years also improved. Only 17 percent of
the 12 projects evaluated by the OED by FY02 were rated unsatisfactory, which compares favorably to
the 50 percent obtained in FYOO. This improvement brought the percentage of projects evaluated by
OED since FY80 and rated unsatisfactory down from 27.5 percent in W O O to a current level of 24.5
percent.

With 30 percent of i t s commitments at risk in W O O , Ecuador was identified as a country for
which a Portfolio Improvement Plan was needed. This was developed and implemented in FYO1,
bringing portfolio performance to satisfactory levels with only one project classified as At Risk in R O l
and in FY02, although some effectiveness delays, shortages of counterpart funds, and changes in project
personnel with the new Administration have l e d t o a downturn in performance during and immediately
after the election year, particularly in the disbursement ratio indicator. The recently closed S A L was the
only problem project in W02, but i t represented 37.4 percent of total commitments in the portfolio.
Conditions related to the disbursement of the two floating tranches were not attained, in spite of an
intense effort with the legislative body. Recognizing the high political cost that would be associated with

112.

31

I

trying to secure these conditions, the previous and current Administrations decided to cancel the two
floating tranches.

113. The introduction o f a competitive process for filling key positions in project implementation units
(PIUS)--involving an independent entity in prescreening candidates-has strengthened the quality and
continuity of staffing in the PIUs, insulated them from the consequences of frequent changes at the
ministerial level in different Ministries, and avoided stopgo cycles in project implementation that were
affecting performance. While the process met occasional resistance from new political appointees, i t
enjoyed strong support from the Office of the President during the previous Administration. The Bank
has shared this experience with the new Administration and built i t into the CAS triggers, and have
received expressions of support for this process from the Office of the President and from the Ministry of
Economy and Finance.
114.
Availability of counterpart funds has been an important recurrent issue with several projects.
The Bank has proposed an agreement with the new Administration to monitor the availability of
counterpart funding on a quarterly basis. This i s being built into the CAS triggers for the base case
scenario, as adequate counterpart funding gains particular importance to the extent that the new Fiscal
Responsibility Law precludes state borrowing for noninvestment expenditures, which would include PIU
operating expenditures.
115.
Finally, the CPPR process has strengthened with the inclusion of insights from the Bank’s
Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian People’s Advisory Council in portfolio reviews. Representatives from
the indigenous movement provided valuable suggestions to project coordinators on how to ensure greater
outreach, bridge language and cultural barriers, and build on local social capital. A clear example o f this
was the inclusion o f indigenous enumerators in the Agricultural Census project. Moreover, the World
Bank Office in Quito has encouraged greater coordination among project units responsible for different
projects in the portfolio to achieve synergies across sectors.
B. Fiduciary Responsibilities: Procurement and Financial Management
116.

The Bank conducted a procurement review (CPAR) in April 2000, which identified various
risks in public procurement. Key factors identified as possibly affecting project performance were the
lack of effective tools for procurement planning and monitoring during project implementation, the lack
o f skilled and capable agency staff for management of procurement functions, and the lack o f national
standard bidding documents for the procurement of goods and works and the selection of consultants. As
a result, the overall procurement risk assessment o f the Ecuador portfolio was rated high in the April 2000
CPAR. The Bank attempted to mitigate this risk for Bank projects by organizing procurement training
sessions for all project procurement staff, the most recent of which was held in June 2002. In practice,
procurement procedures under Bank projects have been closely supervised and generally found to be
satisfactory. Nevertheless, the Government and the Bank have discussed improving procurement
implementation as well as the possible preparation of a new procurement law, to be followed by sound
implementing rules and regulations, with a view to (a) streamlining current procedures for the
procurement o f goods and works; (b) incorporating revised consultancy standards; (c) adopting national
standardized bidding documents for procurement by all public agencies; (d) introducing electronic
technologies in public procurement; and (e) establishing a national regulatory body to strengthen
oversight, ensure proper enforcement of the procurement law, and increase transparency and efficiency in
the public contracting system. The Government has demonstrated i t s interest in advancing in this area,
particularly with Internet-based procurement and disclosures as part of an e-government system.

117. The Bank has implemented a risk-based approach to monitoring and evaluation of financial
management capacity at the project level. This involves assessment of new projects; reviews of audit
reports, statements of expenditure, and flow of funds; assistance with the implementation of new
Financial Monitoring Reports; and general ongoing financial management supervision. The presence o f a
38

financial management consultant in the Field Office has contributed to closer follow-up of corrective
actions where needed, and technical advice for PIU staff. In addition, the Bank has supported generalized
training on disbursements and financial management for PIU finance directors and related staff. Overall
findings are that most PIUs are adequately staffed by experienced professionals and that financial
management arrangements meet minimum Bank requirements, including Accounting and Financial
Reporting arrangements. The rollout o f the Government's SIGEF will need to be closely monitored,
since only two projects are currently integrated into the system, and it will be important to ensure that the
project internal control environment i s not compromised in the transition to SIGEF. On the other hand,
once i t i s rolled out, the integrated system, supported by a new Public Finances Control Law approved in
2001, i s likely to increase transparency in accounting, treasury, and budgeting throughout the
government.
118. There has been particularly close follow-up over the past year on project audits. During FY02,
most projects submitted delayed audit reports, with delays attributed to lack o f coordination between the
projects and the Controller General o f the State (CGE), procedural delays in contracting auditors, and in
the review of final audit reports by the CGE (prior to delivery to the Bank). Corrective measures have
been taken via a general meeting o f all PIU Directors and the CGE as part o f a portfolio review with the
incoming Administration, to begin the contracting of auditors in a timely manner. Moreover, early this
year the Bank conducted a Pilot Capacity Assessment of Private Audit Firms in Ecuador. The assessment
revealed that the institutional capacity, audit methodology, and engagement practices of fm are uneven,
As a result of the assessment,
when benchmarked against international auditing standards.
recommendations were made to the CGE prior to the launching of the annual audits on criteria for
accepting firms to audit Bank-financed projects. It i s therefore expected that the risk to Bank funds posed
by uneven quality of audits w i l l be reduced. In practice, 80 percent of projects received unqualified
opinions on the financial statements and 86 percent on the Special Account. Qualifications were due to
use of funds to cover local taxes and counterpart funds, or to inadequate supporting documentation.
Statement o f Expenditure (SOE) reviews (performed by external auditors and by Bank staff during SOE
processing and supervision missions) revealed modest ineligible expenses in three projects. This is,
however, not considered a systemic risk.

C. Country Program Monitoring and Evaluation
119.
The Bank will monitor the country program in this CAS through a set of benchmark
indicators. The benchmark indicators for this CAS include the outcome indicators identified by
govemment for i t s economic program (Section 111, Table 2) together with intermediary benchmark
indicators that the Bank intends to monitor in relation to specific Bank assistance. Annex B 9 provides a
complete l i s t of the output and intermediate indicators, and Table 10 highlights the critical indicators for
assessing the performance o f the program. In addition, the Bank will monitor input indicators related to
i t s portfolio on a regular basis, and with Government as part o f the CPPR process. These input indicators
are included in Annex B2, and key performance indicators for Bank inputs are highlighted in Table 10.
120.
The monitoring and evaluation o f progress under the CAS will encompass a review of the status
o f outcome and intermediate benchmark indicators on a regular basis with the country team as part of
portfolio management, and on an annual basis with the Government and with strategic partners and
stakeholders in civil society. The annual reviews of the outcome and intermediate benchmark indicators
with the Government will be closely linked to the larger of two annual Country Portfolio Performance
Reviews, which the Bank's Ecuador team conducts with Government and with the Indigenous and AfroEcuadorian People's Advisory Council. In addition, the Bank will review the CAS strategy and the status
o f the CAS triggers as an integral part o f i t s annual programming missions with govemment. Annual
reviews of benchmark indicators with strategic partners and with stakeholders will be built into the
Bank's regular consultation processes with these partners and with civil society.

D. Exposure and Risks
121. Despite the expanded lending program, it is expected that both debt service to the Bank and
overall public debt service will decrease during the next four years. The 2002 Fiscal Responsibility L a w
establishes a ceiling o f 3.5 percent in real growth in public expenditures, and a requirement that the ratio
o f public debt to GDP be reduced by four percentage points per year until it reaches 40 percent.
Ecuador’s total public debt to GDP fell sharply from 98 percent to 58 percent between 1999 and 2002,
and i s projected to reach 40 percent or below over the next four years, while external public debt to GDP
fell from 83 percent to 46 percent between 1999 and 2002, and i s projected to decline to 30 percent over
this CAS period (Annex B7). Within public external debt, the proportion that i s preferred creditor debt
increased in August 2000 from 30 percent to 38 percent as Ecuador successfully negotiated a 40-percent
reduction in the principal outstanding on i t s private creditor debt. I t i s expected that Ecuador’s access to
private capital markets w i l l remain constrained over the CAS period, and that the proportion o f preferred
creditor debt service to total public debt service could increase from around one-third to close to one-half
before Ecuador resumes principal repayments in 2006 on the Global Bonds issued in the 2000 private
debt reduction. Ecuador’s large share o f multilateral (38 percent) and bilateral creditors (20 percent)
makes i t less vulnerable to a short-term, debt-led crisis. Nevertheless, Ecuador’s debt situation calls for
continuous monitoring.
122. The World Bank accounted for 21 percent o f preferred creditor debt as o f December 2002, and
this proportion i s expected to remain more or less constant as the CAF (26 percent) implements a $2
billion program over the next four years, while the IDB (50 percent) curtails i t s growth in lending to $600
million over the same period. Debt service to the Bank as a proportion o f total public debt service has
decreased from 10.8 percent to 8.6 percent since 2000, as the Government has made net payments to the
Bank exceeding $250 million over the past five years, servicing i t s debt to the Bank notwithstanding i t s
challenging financial circumstances and difficulties maintaining timely payments to a number o f other
creditors.
123. Even with an expanded pipeline, debt service to the Bank as a proportion o f total public debt
service i s projected to continue decreasing over the CAS period to around 7 percent, while debt service to
the Bank as a share o f exports o f goods and services i s expected to halve from 2.2 percent in 2000 to 1.1
percent by the end o f this CAS period in 2007. The Bank’s assistance program aims at promoting
conditions for sustained high growth, which in turn should yield an improved debt situation. As noted,
with successful implementation o f the economic program and sustained dollarization, the Bank expects

40

real economic growth averaging 4 percent, with single-digit inflation rates slowly converging to
international levels over the CAS period. On the other hand, this scenario i s subject to both external and
internal risks.

124. Ecuador is vulnerable to significant external shocks. The country i s subject to major risks of
adverse terms-of-trade shocks-especially for oil and bananas-and of competitive pressures from
neighboring countries that can depreciate their currencies. These risks are particularly destabilizing in a
dollarized economy such as Ecuador’s because they would require a real effective exchange rate
adjustment that could only happen through deflation of domestic prices in nontradables, which in turn
could imply a protracted recession, possible problems with debt service in the public and nontradables
sectors and potential impacts on the financial sector. Other risks that are less likely but could also have
significant impacts include a substantial decline in remittance flows, which are currently the secondlargest source of external finance after oil; a sharp rise in global interest rates, which could increase the
cost of debt service; depressed exports due to a global economic downturn; or major natural disasters.
125. Ecuador also faces important internal risks. The major source of internal risks are political
resistance to the fiscal and structural reform program from indigenous, labor, and social movements,
including from public servants, that could translate into unsustainably high budget expenditures and wage
concessions; and lack o f Congressional support for the Administration’s reform program-specially in
light of the perennial problem of regional differences on policy issues-resulting in blockage o f key
legislative reforms. Other important internal risks are potential pressures from the entrepreneurial sector
for an “easy way out” through protectionism or even abandonment of the U.S. dollar; diminished state
revenues and limited debt reduction due to continued underinvestment in hydrocarbons; or conversely,
higher oil revenues that encourage Ecuadorians to postpone efforts to contain public expenditures and
make them more flexible; public frustration over the debt burden, leading to unilateral postponements of
repayments to pay the “social debt” of historically underfunded social expenditures; continued inability to
address governance challenges; and constraints in public sector implementation capacity.
126. These risks will be mitigated but cannot be fully eliminated. However, they w i l l be addressed
through a series of actions: political and social risks will be mitigated through the National Dialogue
process, together with active engagement and dialogue with a broad range of Ecuadorian society by the
Bank jointly with other multilateral and bilateral donor agencies. I t will be especially important to raise
broad awareness of the difference between short-term stabilization measures which frequently impact the
poor through price increases, and structural reforms, which are essential to meet the clear demands of
Ecuadorian citizens for better access to services, and which if postponed result in worsening economic
conditions and the need for stabilization measures. Moreover, governance and capacity w i l l be
strengthened through a range of lending and non-lending assistance designed to promote increased public
sector efficiency, transparency and accountability. To mitigate economic and financial risks, the Bank
will assist the Government in encouraging competitiveness and diversification of exports, improving the
environment for FDI, promoting more efficient labor and financial markets, monitoring of financial sector
liquidity and exposures, maintaining a fiscal program that reduces the debt burden, increasing the share of
non-oil fiscal revenues in the budget, ensuring that higher oil revenues are managed effectively through
the fiscal stabilization fund, and developing more responsive and better-targeted safety nets for those
most affected by shocks and economic downturns. Finally, to mitigate debt overburdening and Bank
exposure risks, the Bank would closely coordinate i t s lending program with other multilaterals to trigger
important increases in international assistance with the successful implementation o f the Government’s
economic program, but also prompt adjustments in overall support if the political will for reform falters.
Even if the low case scenario materializes, the Bank would remain engaged in a dialogue and maintain
selected operations to protect the most vulnerable groups, promote sustainable development, and reduce
poverty.

41

VI. CONCLUDINGREMARKS
127. Three years after dollarization, Ecuador i s at an important juncture in which it can reap the
benefits o f a monetary system that entails l o w rates o f inflation and considerable predictability for longerterm planning and investment, but which at the same time requires even more urgently the structural
reforms that were needed but not implemented before dollarization to compensate for lost nominal
exchange rate flexibility in responding t o adverse external shocks. Ecuador’ s prospects for stability and
economic recovery are promising if the economic reform program i s implemented. However, i t s fiscal
and external positions remain vulnerable because o f rigidities in the economy in response to potential
shocks. Moreover, Ecuadorians s t i l l need t o build the necessary consensus to encourage more foreign
direct investment, strengthen the financial system, and create more flexible labor markets to better absorb
shocks, reduce volatility, and ensure sustained growth. Therefore, while the risks related to the Ecuador
program remain significant even after measures are taken to mitigate them, there are major benefits
associated with Bank assistance t o Ecuador in the current situation as the country endeavors to implement
economic reforms. Successful implementation o f the reform program i s essential to prevent deterioration
o f social conditions and worsening poverty, and the Bank’s assistance in partnership with other donors
can play a critical role in correcting macroeconomic imbalances, advancing on structural reforms to
promote more equitable and sustainable growth, and reorienting social policies to protect and assist the
poor. Thus, the economic reform program w i l l require substantial commitment from Ecuador’s
population, together with international support.

Annex C. Progress Achieved to Date with the Bank’s Current Portfolio of Loans and
Montreal Protocol Assistance
Agricultural
Research-PROMSA (L.4075 for $19.8 million. Approved July 1996, Closing December
2003). The objective o f the loan i s to support increased agricultural research, with a view t o increasing
productivity and agricultural production while preserving or improving the natural resource base. The
project supports a Competitive Fund for research projects, intemational strategic alliances, and the
strengthening o f the National Autonomous Institute for Agricultural Research (INIAP). T o date, 114
projects (compared to a goal o f 110) and 17 strategic alliances with education and research centers
(compared to a goal o f 18) have been approved in 21 provinces under the competitive funds component.
Moreover, private sector participation with 56 percent financing compared to the 30 percent initially
expected has permitted the financing o f more subprojects. On the other hand, the future o f the
competitive funds program i s unclear, because financing has yet to be identified once the World Bank
project closes, and i t w i l l be important for the Government to consider making support for research in
agriculture a national priority. The INIAP component began slowly, and while the targets in terms of
Masters Degrees has been surpassed, I N I A P ’ s institutional development plan i s well behind target and
w i l l need to be accelerated before the closure o f the project.
Agricultural Census-SICA (L.4279 for $24.8 million. Auproved January 1998, Closing September
2004). In April 2002, the World Bank Board o f Directors approved a $4.8 million supplement to the
original $20 million approved in January 1998. The objective o f the project i s to ensure the availability,
consistency, timeliness, and usefulness o f information from the agricultural census and other sources, in
order to reduce asymmetries in access to information among different social groups, improve the
competitiveness o f the agricultural sector, strengthen policies and the institutional framework o f the
sector, and ensure the institutional sustainability o f the SICA project. In 2002, the Government
disseminated the general national and provincial results o f the agricultural census. The project has the
most visited website in Ecuador, with an average o f 1.2 million hits per month; i t provides information for
70 weekly radio communications, including 8 in the indigenous quechua language, reaching an audience
o f around 800,000 as estimated by the project coordinating unit. A key outcome o f the project has been
the support provided to the “Consultative Councils,” which bring together stakeholders in the production
and marketing chain for 11 agricultural products, whereby SICA has provided independent information
that has facilitated consensus building and planning, and contributed to resolution of intrasectoral
conflicts. It w i l l be important t o maintain this project under the budget o f the Ministry o f Agriculture in
order to provide continuity in t h i s process once the Bank project closes.
Rural Poverty-PROLOCAL (L.7067 for $25.2 million, Approved July 2001, Closing December 2006).
The objective o f this project i s t o improve the well-being o f poor families in the microregions covered
under the project, beginning with southern Manabi province and the upper watershed o f the Jubones
River, b y supporting participatory local development planning, local advisory services, and subprojects.
The project i s cofinanced b y the European Union, which i s supporting the strengthening o f rural financial
services. The project was declared effective in April 2002, work has begun at the community level in the
design o f the local development plans, and a gender strategy has been developed for the project. The
management o f the project i s also being decentralized further to the local level.
Development Project for Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples-PRODEPW
(L.4277 for $25
million. Approved September 1998. Closing April 2003). The main objectives o f the project are to
strengthen management capacity, democratic integration, and the development process that respect the
cultural values and identity o f indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian peoples in Ecuador, reducing their
poverty levels and strengthening capacity with respect to participatory, decentralized planning processes.
During the past four years, the project has financed components to strengthen the indigenous and AfroEcuadorian organizations, nations and peoples; studies on and titling o f ancestral lands and o f water
systems; rural investments; and capacity building for government agencies responsible for policy
development for indigenous peoples (CODENPE) and for Afro-Ecuadorians (CODAE). The project has
been successful, facilitating 210 local development plans at the community level; providing support to
71

their respective implementing units; supporting educational and cultural programs-among which the
recovery o f cultural identity and the language o f the Zripara people stands out; and titling 252,000
hectares o f ancestral lands. The rural investment component has financed 654 projects, benefiting more
than 60,000 families, and has provided seed capital for 574 solidarity funds, benefiting 14,000 families.
The project i s cofinanced by the International Fund for Agricultural Development, which has provided
$15 million in financing directed primarily to strengthening rural financial services.
Health Services Modernization-MODERSA (L.4342 for $45 million, Approved June 1998, Closing
December 2004). The objective o f Modersa i s to support health sector reform and the construction o f the
National Health System, in order to improve access to health services for the poorest, and improve the
equity, efficiency, and quality o f health services, with particular emphasis o n maternal and child care in
selected provinces and municipalities. The project components support the development o f the legal and
judicial framework, decentralization o f the health system, hospital modernization, and the Integrated
Health Monitoring and Evaluation System (SIME). One o f the main successes o f the project to date i s
Congress’s approval in 2002 o f the Organic L a w o f the National Health System, wherefore the project
w i l l support the development o f the corresponding implementing rules and regulations. The project
implementation unit reports a 40-percent advance in the implementation o f the new structure o f the
Ministry o f Public Health and in the decentralization model, with local management agreements signed
with the cities o f Cuenca and Tena, and advances in the other eight project cities. With regard to hospital
modernization, strategic and business plans have been approved in 7 o f the 10 targeted hospitals, while
the SIME system i s being implemented at the national and local level. The project has also developed
contingency plans in the event that emergency assistance i s required to address a natural disaster such as a
possible El N i i i o phenomenon.
Financial Sector TA Loan-FSTAL (L.4567. for $10 million, Apuroved June 2000, Closing June 2004).
The objective o f the project i s to support the administration and resolution o f the financial sector crisis
and to strengthen the regulatory framework and supervisory capacity with a view t o promoting the longterm solvency and efficiency o f the banking system. The original components support the strengthening
o f the Superintendency o f Banks and Insurance (SBS) and the Deposit Guarantee Agency (AGD),
restructuring o f corporate debt and technical assistance for the preparation o f a competition law and
modernized bankruptcy legislation. The project, which was supported b y parallel financing by the IDB
and CAF, has developed manuals for onsite examinations and off-site monitoring to strengthen banking
supervision, and i s developing proposals for legal reforms to banking laws. It also supported a Debt
Restructuring Unit that implemented an incentive-compatible mechanism for restructuring o f $1.3 billion
in corporate debt owed b y borrowers with loans o f over $50,000 each. The F S T A L has also supported
studies for the development o f a strategy and action plan for the financial sector. The withdrawal o f the
AGD from the project activities and participation o f the Central Bank w i l l lead t o a restructuring of the
project that addresses newly identified needs, including strengthening o f the payments and liquidity
mechanisms, an anti-money-laundering program, enforcement o f rapid foreclosure provisions (known as
coactiva) on loans that could not be restructured, and improving information technology for the Banking
Superintendency.
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation-PRAGUAS
(L.7035, for $32 million, Approved October 2000,
Closing October 2004). The project i s the f i r s t phase o f a 10-year Adaptable Program Loan (APL), the
objective o f which i s t o improve living conditions for inhabitants o f rural areas and small municipalities
through the provision o f sustainable water supply and sewerage services; consolidate a major reform o f
the sector to improve institutional efficiency and service delivery; achieve sustainable services for 1.6
million beneficiaries in rural areas; and transfer water and sanitation services in 50 municipalities
currently provided directly b y municipal govemments to autonomous (public and private) operators. This
f i r s t phase supports sectoral development (of laws, regulations, policies, and institutions), rural
investment, and technical assistance to municipalities to apply a delegated management model for water
and sanitation services. T o date, framework agreements have been reached with 103 o f 152 eligible
municipalities (the main urban centers of which have less than 10,000 inhabitants), and 175 specific
system-design agreements have been prepared for 379 communities, with a view t o advancing in the
72

construction o f water and sanitation systems. The project has been slowed by the need for communities
to bring together counterpart funding as evidence o f ownership to ensure sustainability, and has been
hampered b y parallel programs following a more paternalist approach o f requiring n o counterpart
financing f r o m the municipalities or communities, and by turnover in technical staff at the municipal
level.
International Trade and Integration (L.4346 for $21 million, Approved June 1998, Closing June 2003).
The objective o f the project i s to encourage economic growth via international trade and integration with
the global economy. This i s to be achieved through the modernization o f the State’s institutional structure
for overseeing external trade; strengthening capacity building and entrepreneurial innovation to develop
links between micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises with international trade; and improving
quality, productivity, and environmental practices. During the past four years, the project has supported
export and investment policies that include the External Trade Law, the national plan for attracting
foreign investment, the national competitiveness agenda, creation o f the National Competitiveness
Council and the National Quality System, regulation o f the Customs L a w regarding the drawback system,
and draft competition and tourism laws. Inthe area o f competitiveness, the project supported a diagnostic
study o n the country’s competitiveness, contributed to the reduction in the time needed to set up a
company f r o m 150 to 30 days, and i s supporting one-stop shops for businesses (so-called entrepreneurial
development agencies, in which all necessary official permits are granted in one place) and a program o f
support to Ecuadorian migrants. The shared funds component has reached more than 700 small and
medium export-oriented enterprises and 3 1 NGOs that support more than 12,000 microenterprises,
achieving overall increases in employment by 29 percent, sales b y 17 percent, and exports by 8 percent,
with a greater variety and quality o f products and markets. In the area o f quality, opportunities have been
established for new laboratories to provide internationally recognized quality ratings (in the area o f health
certificates the termination o f the monopoly o f the state laboratory has cut the time from over two years to
30 days), and has developed a quality-improvement program that i s contributing to a significant increase
in the number o f enterprises with I S 0 qualifications. The project was extended from the original closing
date o f June 2002 to continue with the quality component, and the lack o f sustainability o f the system o f
metrology, norms, and accreditation remains a concern. The Bank also indicated i t s concern that the
drawback system, designed after inputs from project consultants, did not require adequate evidence o f
payment o f taxes prior to devolution o f a fixed coefficient. Finally, as part o f the implementation
completion review, the Bank has recommended an analysis o f the cost per j o b created and o f the pre- and
post-assistance tax collections from beneficiary enterprises.
(L.7082 for $23
Power and Communication Sectors Modernization and Rural Services-PROMEC
million. Approved November 2001, Closing June 2006). The loan i s accompanied b y a Global
Environmental Facility Grant for $2.84 million, which also supports the project objective o f increasing
the modernization o f the telecommunications and electricity sectors via strengthening o f regulatory,
supervision, and control agencies; expansion o f electricity and telecommunications services in rural and
peri-urban areas and the development o f information and communication technology-based (ICT-based)
business among s m a l l enterprises and lower-income levels; implementation o f programs to promote the
efficient use o f energy and environmental protection; and integration o f broader society in the
modernization process via consultation, participation, and communication mechanisms. The project
became effective only in August 2002, and has been affected by an initial shortage o f counterpart funds,
although close t o one-quarter o f project costs w i l l eventually be covered by private sector participation.
T o ensure the success o f the project i t w i l l be important to depoliticize decisionmaking b y regulatory,
supervision and control agencies, and to address the worrisome financial situation o f the electricity and
telecommunication sectors. Moreover, the rates o f return for rural off-grid electrification projects w i l l
need to be attractive to ensure private participation and sustainability o f these and o f pilot projects for
energy efficiency and o f I C T centers that serve the poor.
Public Sector Financial Management-SIGEF
(L.7 110 for $13.86 million, Auuroved March 2002,
Closing September 2005). The objective of this project i s to ensure the sustainability and strengthening
o f the reforms in public finances systems, increasing coverage o f the Integrated Financial Management
73

System (SIGEF) to achieve consolidated national accounts with the level o f coverage and quality required
by the Ministry o f Economy and Finance, and to bring greater transparency to the management of public
resources. Five principal components will be supported with the project: consolidation of the system;
extension of coverage at a national and municipal level; technological sustainability (including web-based
access to SIGEF); strengthening of the General Controller of the State (ensuring an interface with SIGEF
that will allow more direct auditing of accounts); and legal, regulatory, and normative support for SIGEF.
The signing o f the loan agreement was postponed as a result of changes in the Ministry o f Economy and
Finance, leading to a reevaluation of the project’s components. The loan agreement has been signed by
the new Administration, which i s committed to implementing the project with a few modifications over
the coming years.
Montreal Protocol (TF024359 for $3.41 million. Approved October 2000. Closing September 2004). The
project for the reduction of ozone-depleting substances (ODs), phase 11, i s implemented by the Ministry
o f External Trade, Industrialization, Fisheries and Competitiveness, with support from the Multilateral
Fund of the Montreal Protocol. The objective of the project i s to support the elimination o f ODS through
industrial conversion activities and institutional development. Ecuador i s at an advanced stage of
completion of the ODS foreseen in the Protocol, having accomplished the requirement to limit the
consumption of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to 1995-98 levels. On the other hand, the Montreal Protocol
targets will become increasingly demanding, including a 50-percent reduction in carbon dioxide
emissions relative to 1995-98, and a similar reduction in methyl bromide applications. The project i s
subsidizing conversion efforts by enterprises that are reducing CFCs, and supporting a pilot to
demonstrate alternatives to methyl bromide in ornamental horticulture, and working directly with major
users.

Annex D. The SAPRI Process
The Structural Adjustment Participatory Review Initiative (SAPRI) i s a joint project of the World Bank,
governments, and a global network of NGOs and civil society organizations. Launched in 1996 and
covering six countries (Bangladesh, Ecuador, Ghana, Hungary, Mali, and Uganda), the goals of SAPRI
are to improve the understanding of the impact of adjustment policies and to seek ways of incorporating
the participation of civil society in policy formulation related to Bank operations.‘
In the case of Ecuador, the Institute of Ecology and Development of Andean Communities
(IEDECA) led the process o f coordinating civil society representation and participation. The process
began with a preparatory phase in 1996197 in which different sectors of civil society were invited to
participate in seven regional and national fora across Ecuador, in which a total of 330 delegates reviewed
and debated experience with structural adjustment in Ecuador. Forum participants systematized
information on the impact o f adjustment policies, proposed alternatives, suggested themes for further
research, and elected 40 delegates for a f i r s t National Forum in January 1999 that consolidated the
regional proposals and elected members to a SAPRI National Steering Committee. Two national
universities were selected to conduct research on themes related to the impact of financial liberalization
on production and households consumption, the impact o f trade liberalization and labor deregulation on
production and employment, and the social impact of policies on subsidies. These studies were
concluded in October 1999, ratified by SAPRI, and discussed in a Second National Forum in December
2000. Finally, experiences from the s i x countries were brought together in a joint meeting with President
Wolfensohn in July 2002, where i t was decided that consultation with SAPRI networks and with other
civil society representatives should continue at the country level, particularly in the formulation of
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) or Country Assistance Strategies, with the agreement and
participation of the respective Governments.

The process in Ecuador’s case has led to recommendations on substantive issues such as national
development planning, fiscal management, incentives for production and employment generation,
education, health, gender, culture and environment, civil society participation, and fighting corruption that
are highly consonant with those described in Section 1I.D o f this CAS. On the other hand, and taking into
account that the consultations began in 1999, when the national debt exceeded GDP, there was a strong
repudiation in Ecuador’s SAPRI dialogues of the national debt and of the need to service it. Moreover,
there was a strong reaction against further development of hydrocarbons, which was seen as damaging to
the environment for everyone, while the benefits of oil favored only a limited segment o f society due to
corruption. The current thinking i s believed to have shifted more in favor of cleaning up the
hydrocarbons industry, both environmentally and in terms of governance, and dedicating these resources
to paying the social debt rather than the national debt. Important recommendations were also developed
by SAPRI with regard to process in addition to policy content, including:
Establishing an efficient and effective methodology, including training and information, for ensuring
community participation aimed at reaching appropriate consensus with the participation of
representatives from all segments o f society.
Proposing, approving, and implementing a “Law for Civil Dialogue, Participation and Control” that
applies the above proposed methodologies, and that enforces i t s application on the part of every
single stratum of public administration. This should be accompanied by a Fiscal Accountability Law
to help control public finances, both at the national and regional levels.
Establishing effective mechanisms envisioning regular submittal of accountability reports to be issued
by all main officers of the State and all publicly elected officials.
Improving transparency for all information on matters o f public administration.
Engaging potential “beneficiaries” in extended discussions before incurring public debt.

Asking multilateral entities to include “positive conditioning” requirements as part of the credit
agreements.
Identifying effective monitoring and social control mechanisms, educating the public on their
coresponsibility in public actions and by acknowledging the interaction that should exist with the
private sector.

SAPRI’s achievements in Ecuador include the inclusion of a far broader civil society
representation than i s common to most processes, where well-established foundations and organizations
based in the capital city tend to have the biggest voice in participatory processes. SAPRI has reached out
geographically and sectorally, including important representation from women, rural and indigenous
groups, and the Afro minority. The recognition and legitimacy brought to new social actors can clearly
serve to strengthen national democratic processes. Key members of the SAPRI network at the national
level have included the Federation of Chambers o f Small Industry, the Women’s Network of Azuay
province, the Organization of Free Workers’ Unions, Northern Border Communities (representing AfroEcuadorians), the Confederation of Indigenous Organizations of the Ecuadorian Amazon (CONFENM),
Rural Social Security (Seguro Socia2 Cumpsino), Women’s Political Coordinator, the Federation of
Barrios (neighborhoods) of Guayaquil, the Human Rights Commission, the Chamber of Artisans, and
professors of faculties of economics of various universities.
SAPRI has proposed that i t s members be partners in a policymaking dialogue rather than simply
claimants under Bank- and Government-defined operations. In addition to creating a space for dialogue
on adjustment themes in a context in which economic literacy has at times been a constraint, SAPRI has
encouraged research and analytical studies by academic and civil society organizations. The
decentralized dialogues i t has undertaken and proposed could contribute importantly to strengthening
ownership and governance in public reforms and modernization.

The shortcomings of the process have included limited participation by the Government,
especially by high-ranking public officials, indicating shortcomings in Government commitment to the
SAPRI exercise, although not necessarily to consultation processes. Greater participation by the private
sector, including larger chambers, could strengthen the inclusiveness of the process. Methodological
weaknesses in the research reduced the value of the academic studies as an input into policy formulation
(for example, the overall increase in poverty over the past two decades coincided with Fund-led reform
programs and was therefore largely attributed to them, without highlighting that there were important
limitations in Ecuador’s implementation of the Fund’s recommendations). Moreover, while the Bank i s
highly committed to working with civil society to ensure successful design and implementation of i t s
projects, implementation of the key recommendations by SAPRI ultimately depends on the Government’s
commitment. Nevertheless the Bank-together with Government officials-has maintained a regular
dialogue with SAPRI and other civil society representatives in order to improve the quality and ownership
of Bank-supported projects, and ensure that the projects reach the intended beneficiaries.

Annex E. CAS Consultations with Civil Society and Other Stakeholders
In order to root i t s new Country Assistance Strategy in the priorities expressedby Ecuadorian civil society
and those of the Government, the World Bank undertook a consultation process for the CAS in nine cities
across Ecuador between January 27 and February 7, 2003. The Bank team, supported by a moderator
from the Latin American Faculty for Social Sciences (FLACSO), visited the Amazon, and the highland
and coastal regions of Ecuador in a 1,400-mile road trip to Puyo, Ambato, Guayaquil, Cuenca, Loja,
Portoviejo, Esmeraldas, and Ibarra before returning to Quito (Figure E.1).

Figure E.l. The Bank Undertook CAS Consultations in Nine Cities Across Ecuador

World Bank Map No. 32432.

Approximately 300 people were invited to participate in the consultations, including
representatives of national government ministries, the mayor o f the city and the provincial prefect; local
government leaders and mayors of smaller neighboring towns; representatives o f chambers o f production,
commerce, agriculture, small industry, fishery, tourism, and artisans; labor movements and unions;
indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian organizations; community organizations representing rural inhabitants
and low-income urban neighborhoods; academic and research institutions; women’s organizations and
environmental organizations; local and international developmental NGOs; project beneficiaries; and the
Catholic and Evangelical churches (Figure E.2). To extend the coverage o f the consultations, invitations
were extended in each city not only to people from that city but also to people from neighboring towns
and provinces. For example, in the central highlands city of Ambato in the province o f Tungurahua,
invitations were also extended to people in neighboring Cotopaxi and Chimborazo provinces. Similarly,
people from Nap0 and Morona Santiago were invited to Puyo in the Amazon province o f Pastaza.
In each of the meetings, the Bank team sought to establish a dialogue around three key questions:

1.
2.
3.

What i s the perception of the economic and social situation in the country?
What should Ecuador’s priorities be in light of this situation?
How should the World Bank help to achieve these priorities?

A consistent methodology was followed to ensure comparability o f findings across cities. In
particular, meetings began by presenting all people present; establishing rules, objectives, and principles
for the meetings; a presentation on the World Bank and i t s work in Ecuador; questions and answers
regarding the presentation; dialogue around the f i r s t question on the situation of the country; dialogue
around the second question o f national priorities; establishment of a hierarchy among the priorities
identified; recommendations for the World Bank; and a follow-up discussion. In particular, the Bank
committed itself to sending a result of the findings to each and every person invited, to sharing the
findings with the National Government, and to using the findings o f the CAS consultation in the process
o f designing the CAS. All the dialogues were recorded on tape, flip chart results were recorded, and
notes were taken by the moderator and by the members o f the Bank team. Moreover, each member
present was invited to share h i s or her views via any of three modalities with which he or she would feel
most comfortable: in the general forum, in writing, or privately in a one-on-one side meeting with an
identified member of the World Bank. In designing the methodology, deciding on appropriate locations
for the meetings, and identifying potential invitees, the Bank drew on the suggestions of a group of 15
members of civil society who were invited to a "consultation on the consultation process" in mid-January.
Perceptions Regarding the Economic and Social Situation in Ecuador
In response to the question of how the participants perceived the economic and social situation o f
the country, and other (noneconomic or social) issues, the respondents noted the difficulty o f isolating
economic from social issues, and the same themes arose across the groupings o f issues. The top dozen
results of the consultation in each category are tabulated in Table E.1.

78

The key economic issue was unemployment or underemployment. This issue was closely related
to inadequate support for production by microenterprises and rural producers. Respondents underscored
the lack o f access to credit and to capacity building in order to be able t o compete, and noted that
migration was the main consequence. Another set o f closely related issues was the rising poverty and
inequality, which were seen t o be driven b y corruption and capture o f resources b y a privileged few,
including wealthy entrepreneurs and the State bureaucracy.
The most important social issue was deficient education (discussed further, below), in terms o f
coverage, quality, and equity, with the same concern prevailing in the area o f health and other basic
infrastructure services. Migration and poverty combined t o yield a worrisome loss o f values and identity
and increasing crime and insecurity. The consultations also underscored the major disillusionment among
Ecuadorians with the political system, which reportedly failed t o pay attention to popular needs, was
perceived as corrupt, and failed to plan long term, and to involve local communities (the foundations o f
society) in determining national policies. In the view o f one citizen: “A few people make big mistakes
and then pass the bill on to everyone.. .”.

Perceptions Regarding Priorities for Ecuador

As stated, improving education was by far the most important priority for participants in the
consultations (Figure E.3). Education came f i r s t in seven o f the nine cities, and was identified as a
priority in all nine. Moreover, education was seen as important in both rural and urban areas as a way o f
enabling the poor to earn a better living, and the only way to enable Ecuador to compete with other
countries in an increasingly global economy. Issues raised around education included not only access t o
education, but also improving the poor quality o f education, and ensuring that teachers receive adequate
pay and are properly trained. Second to education was the need to promote employment through
microenterprises, and this was complemented b y the need t o strengthen work through strengthened
community organizations and to ensure adequate access to resources, especially technical training and
credit to increase productivity. Another key priority was t o ensure that investments were undertaken in
line with a vision expressed in a long-term development plan, developed from the grassroots upward and
involving considerable consensus building and participation. Improving health was also seen as
fundamental for increasing well-being, and related to this was the need to improve access to and the
quality o f basic infrastructure, such as safe water, sanitation, and electricity. Moreover, relieving the
burden of the national debt through renegotiations or debt-for-nature swaps or debt-for-socialexpenditures swaps was widely viewed as important. Finally, Jighting corruption, especially at the
national level, was important, as was ensuring that more resources reach the grassroots through an
equitable decentralization process and do not go just t o the big cities.

Figure E.3. The Top National Priority i s Improved Education

sobre la nueva Estrategia de Asistencia a1 Ecuador, 27-01 a1 7-02 de 2003.

Interms o f the coincidence of priorities across the country, education and health were highlighted
as key priorities in all nine cities, promotion of microenterprises and of access to rural and micro credit
were common to seven cities, as was the issue of environmental protection, while participatory long-term
development planning, capacity building for microenterprises, and strengthening o f local community
organizations were common to six o f the nine cities. There were also issues that were more important in
certain cities and areas than in others. For example, Esmeraldas (in the northwest, with a high AfroEcuadorian population) placed particular stress on unemployment; Ibarra, Esmeraldas, and Puyo all
included discussions of concerns related to Plan Colombia and the security situation on the northern
border; Ambato in the central highlands placed particular stress on participatory planning following
successful experiences at the local level; while Cuenca and Puyo, based on their comparative advantage,
placed emphasis on developing tourism. Finally, while both environmental and women’s organizations
were invited, and a significant proportion of the participants were women, interestingly there was a
greater awareness of environmental issues than of gender issues, and the former received greater attention
and discussion in the dialogues. Issues of racism were more likely to be expressed in terms of the need to
promote awareness of cultural diversity. Such sensitive issues as domestic violence and prostitution did
arise on occasion, but were not developed in detail in these forums.
Perceptions Regarding World Bank Support
The recommendations regarding the World Bank fall into three categories: areas in which it
should provide support; how it should do so; and things i t should not do. The areas which the World
Bank should support clearly coincided with national priorities, including education; support for microand rural production and microfinance; fighting conuption; financing basic infrastructure; generating
jobs; and protecting the environment through, for example, community projects for reforestation and
training in natural resource management. The Bank was also invited to be a mediator with the IMF,
which was seen as insensitive in the formulation o f i t s conditionality.
In terms of i t s working procedures and approaches, the Bank was told that i t should ensure that
resources reach the community level and are administered at that level, instead of being lost to central
bureaucracy; should take a longer-term program approach and not just a quick project approach; develop
80

better procedures for evaluating the impact of i t s assistance; build i t s assistance on prior local
experiences; and forgive loans or provide more nonreimbursable assistance. The Bank's policies on
adjustment were criticized and associated with those of the IME;, although two divergent positions
developed on Bank involvement in national policies, with one view suggesting noninterference and
another recommending that the Bank encourage national officials to reform the way the economy
operates.
I t was recommended that the Bank not (a) support governments or bankers perceived as corrupt,
(b) impose conditionality from outside, (c) develop projects from a desk in the city, (d) support the
wealthy who oppress a large part of the population, (e) lend without consideration for the capacity to
repay, (0 get involved in what Ecuadorians themselves are supposed to do, and (8) be slow in handing
over resources.

Conclusions
The CAS consultation builds on a process o f engagement in dialogues with civil society, and i t s
findings are being incorporated into Bank operations and in Bank AA4, an increasing proportion of
which i s intended for knowledge sharing and public debate. On the lending side, the Bank has identified
education, rural production, urban poverty reduction, financial services for the poor, and natural resources
management as possible new projects that directly respond to needs identified by civil society, together
with judicial reform and institutional reform in order to promote increased transparency and efficiency in
the public sector. In terms of methodology, decentralized, community -level design and implementation i s
being promoted through projects such as Prodepine, Prolocal, Praguas, and in the proposed rural roads
project, and the Bank has taken note of the need to ensure greater transparency regarding the application
and impact of i t s loans. Finally, on policy-based lending, the Bank took note o f the need to ensure that
commitments under rapidly disbursing loans to the extent possible enjoy broad ownership and support
among Ecuadorians, rather than be imposed from outside.
The Bank team greatly valued the opportunity to hear opinions from various parts o f civil society
across the country, and participants in turn congratulated the Bank on this initiative, expressed
appreciation to the team for listening to their concerns and committing to reflect them in the development
of the CAS, and expressed the hope that i t would not be a one-time exchange of views. See Box E.l for
the views of civil society in their own words.

Box E.l. Participants in the CAS Consultations Provided Comments on a Range of Topics
‘The situation i s gloomy. We cannot emerge because we do not have the same opportunities in education, in credit.
Also health i s deteriorating, guerrilla groups are on the rise, and no attention i s being paid to what should be done.
-Consultations in Puyo, January 27,2003.
“What will happen to agriculture when the American Free Trade Area i s approved? There i s no unity in this
country. One should establish chains o f production to produce competitively and with quality. One must give value

“Migration implies the departure of brave people, ready to risk everything.”
-Consultation in Guayaquil, January 29,2003.
“Corruption i s at all levels. To what extent does the very government and the international institutions themselves
contribute to corruption?’
-Consultations in Cuenca, January 30,2003.
“The educational system i s poor in Ecuador. In rural areas, there are few productive ventures because the way in
which people have been educated i s not in line with the reality o f the people.”
-Consultation in Loja, January 3 1,2003.
“Systems are needed for channeling resources, ending the concentration of banks, and supporting by developing
small institutions because banks have proven to be corrupt.. .It i s important to reform cooperative law and corporate
law.”
-Consultation in Portoviejo, February 4,2003.
“One fights poverty by producing. One i s no longer poor when one has money and capital. Basic services do not
help if you do not have the money to pay for them even if they exist in your neighborhood.. .if we want to fight
poverty we need to give people opportunities and not just jobs. For example, African palm companies generate jobs,
but how much do they pay people? One has to change credit policies and the system o f credit for communities.
Indigenous communities have land but cannot get access to credit. A large company has begun to exploit minerals
in Chachi territory. If credit could be given to the community they could exploit the resources in their territory
themselves.”
-Consultation in Esmeraldas, February 5,2003.
“It i s important to improve quality, training, and access to Internet. Scholarships are needed at the primary level, not

at the secondary level or higher.
-Consultations in Ibarra, February 6,2003.

“The World Bank should influence the IMF to discuss the conditionality for loans. All international organizations
should help with this if they really want to reduce poverty. The IMF conditions affect the whole population while
the international organizations help only a few target groups.”
-Consultations in Quito, February 7,2003.

Annex F. Client Survey-Summary of Findings
A local polling company, CEDATOS, associated with the intemational polling f i r m GALLUP, is

conducting a client survey for the World Bank. Thefollowing interim report, based on one-quarter of the
planned qualitative surveys, is transcribed verbatim. A full report with qualitative and quantitative
findings will be prepared before the end of fiscal 2003 and will be used to guide Bank lending and
analytical assistance, outreach activities, and extemal relations activities in Ecuador.

With eleven interviews to top-level executives in client and public opinion leading organizations
in Quito and Guayaquil, completed until the release of this report, some of the main research findings are
presented.

THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY
For almost all the respondents the actual country economic situation i s critical, with many
macroeconomic indicators that are of concern not only to the local authorities but also for the companies
and international economic assistance organizations like the World Bank. Poverty i s one of the main
issues that the country must attend, considering i t affects over 70 percent of the total population. Within
this important population group there i s a dramatic stratum of homeless and extremely poor people who
could be an important participant for political and social turmoil. Almost all the participants indicate that
previous and actual social actions taken by the governments do not have a great outreach and are
frequently focused on large urban populations where political and electoral results can be achieved by
certain interested groups while small efforts are focused to smaller populations in rural areas; huge
concerns are also given in the same issue with regards to the northern border population, where poverty,
lack o f assistance and security in very small sectors could be triggering factors for an initial surge of the
Colombian subversive groups.
It i s also important to note that many state-sponsored efforts, while focused toward production
and technical education areas, not always achieve good results for the lack o f funding and the country’s
economic restricted growth. Most important obstacles mentioned by the respondents and which account
for the actual economic Ecuadorian crisis are lack of low-cost financing for small productive activities, an
inefficient banking system which i s the main channel for this fund allocation, the low performance of the
commercial sector, the difficulties inherent to the U.S.-dollar-based monetary system, and the political
issues which affect the country’s stability and the investment climate.

SECTORS WHICH NEED TO BE ATENDED
In order to obtain an adequate economic change most of the respondents consider important to
improve the production sectors, mainly those related to agroindustrial production. It i s important for the
country to improve the aggregate value o f i t s exports, which could be achieved by implementing
production systems that could process the local primary production (raw production) instead of exporting
i t directly to processing and production centers in developed countries. This would mean establishing
processing centers in the geographic areas where raw production i s concentrated; t h i s could in turn allow
an increase in labor demand, which allows consumption to grow. The subsidies could s t i l l be needed in
some cases, but should be considered as temporary investments dedicated to production areas that need
economic resources in order to achieve a higher production status. When these areas reach higher
production and a good income generation, subsidies can be lowered until they are no longer needed. For
many respondents it i s more a matter of a good State administration and transparent economic policy
design and implementation, rather than only allocating external funding for certain production areas. It i s
also a matter of correctly allocating subsidies which nowadays are directed to privileged sectors that
benefit from them and obtain higher turnovers which are not reinvested in the country but instead go to
international private banking accounts for lack of confidence in the local banking system.
83

Some interviewees think Ecuador i s a small country which needs t o start working on improving
i t s external sector b y means o f generating transparent and dependable foreign investment policies which

w i l l provide investors from developed countries an adequate local economic climate for their activities.
They instead see Ecuador as a country where external financial aid i s always directed t o attend a huge
bureaucracy and public debt, while a small part i s actually focused in development and production.

POLITICAL ISSUES OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE WORLD BANK
Ecuador lacks a political ideology, which, in the end, means that every four years, after every
presidential election, the country changes i t s economic planning directives, according to the winning
candidate or political group’s country administration concepts and ideas. Thus there i s not an interest in a
long-term planning and public sector administrative conceptualization, issues for which there i s little
external assistance from foreign organizations.
There i s a lack o f agreements between the production sectors and the government, there are n o
short-term projects, there i s n o internal savings culture in the population, and the country’s image i s not
well promoted abroad.
M a i n issues in which the World Bank should assist Ecuador are those related t o roads and
communications, health, education, sanitation, tourism, and productive household funding.
Many respondents cite the World Bank as an important institution that focuses i t s efforts in
assisting the governments to attend their huge economic problems. The Bank‘s main asset i s i t s funding
capability, capital, and negotiation capabilities. I t i s an institution that has the financial and technical
means necessary to acquire top-level professional personnel with which i t attends the countries’
necessities. In the opinion o f some participants however, the Bank lacks good information channels to let
the people know more about i t s activities in the country, and i s perceived b y many as a country debtgenerating organization. It is, however, an important factor in the fight against poverty in our country; for
some i t i s a key actor for the country’s development by means o f productive investment.

84

Annex G. Program of Other ODA Partners
The World Bank, together with the IDB and the CAF, invited several representatives o f the donor
community to a meeting in March 2003, to discuss the results o f their recent respective programming
mission, and t o invite the donor community to share plans for financial and technical assistance t o
Ecuador over the next four years. This meeting follows earlier meetings to discuss ongoing projects and
initiatives b y the UNDP and the Ecuadorian Institute for International Cooperation (INECI) to develop a
database o f ongoing projects supported with grant funding. The Bank office in Quito i s taking the lead in
developing a database that would begin to structure assistance in Ecuador in a format that i s similar to that
o f a comprehensive development framework, to engender a coordinated, forward-looking perspective, and
to explore possibilities for synergies among donor projects. The data collected to date support the matrix
o f donor priorities for the next four years, shown in Table G.l. In addition to the matrix, this annex
briefly presents the plans o f three key donor partners in Ecuador, namely the CAF, the United Nations
System, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), while Annex H discusses
Bank-IMF relations and the government’s Stand-By Arrangement with the fund.

Andean Development Corporation (CAF)
The CAF devotes around 15 percent o f i t s portfolio o f loans t o Ecuador. It approved seven times more
new lending to Ecuador than the Bank and almost four times more than the IDB during 1997-2002, and i t
w i l l in all likelihood continue to take the lead in terms o f new credits to Ecuador over the next four years,
with a proposed pipeline o f $2 billion. Two-thirds o f i t s portfolio o f $1.1 billion in Ecuador as o f
December 2002 i s accounted for by economic and social infrastructure, especially transport, water, and
energy. Financial and economic support through on-lending t o the private sector makes up almost onequarter. The CAF has also played a significant role in interconnectivity o f infrastructure in the Andean
region, competitiveness and external trade, financial sector strengthening, and disaster management.
Recently, i t has played an important role in providing financial support to the National Dialogue. The
CAF’s goals over the next four years are to support (a) governance, state reforms, and competitiveness;
(b) development o f sustainable infrastructure to support growth and regional integration; (c) support to the
productive sector including small and medium-sized enterprises, strengthening the financial sector, and
developing capital markets; and (d) poverty reduction and environmental protection. I t s proposed $5
million technical assistance programs w i l l assist these areas as well as consolidation o f decentralization
and modernizing regulatory frameworks.

United Nations System
The United Nations System, comprising nine U.N. agencies with offices in Ecuador, developed a
Common Country Assessment (CCA) in 2002 as a basis for the preparation o f a United Nations
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for 2004-08. The CCA views the country situation
through the perspective o f human rights, noting that constraints in the exercise o f human rights in
Ecuador have led t o a cycle o f exclusion and inequality that i s at the roots o f Ecuador’s problems. The
cycle entails further inequitable distribution o f resources, stagnation in human capital development, loss
o f competitiveness, increasing pressure on natural resources, the weak exercise o f democracy, corruption,
discrimination, and concentration o f economic and political power. The U.N. i s currently building o n the
CCA analysis and on i t s comparative advantages as a credible, neutral mediator, infonnation provider,
and mobilizer o f resources t o prepare the UNDAF, which i s likely t o enjoin the U.N. agencies to focus on
poverty reduction through basic social services, environmental sustainability, and strengthening
democratic governance and transparency, and to help Ecuador achieve the Millennium Development
Goals.

United States Agency for International Development
The USAID has identified the following key areas o f emphasis for i t s assistance program: (a) border
development on the northern border with Colombia and the southern border with Peru; (b) environmental
protection; (c) microenterprise finance and support; (d) promotion o f democracy, including themes of
anticomption, decentralization, and justice; (e) macroeconomic and financial sector strengthening,
including corporate debt restructuring, and support to the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. The Bank
and USAID, together with other donors (Table G.l),
has coordinated particularly closely o n issues related
to financial sector strengthening and corporate debt restructuring, in the latter case financing parallel
components o f a joint program o f assistance t o the Superintendency o f Banks with a view t o supporting a
transparent and effective debt restructuring process. I t i s expected that t h i s close coordination w i l l
continue in future.

Annex H. Bank-IMF Relations, and Structural Reforms
in the Letter of Intent with the IMF, 2003-04
In March 2000, the IMF, World Bank, the IDB, and the CAF developed a $2 billion joint program of
support for the Ecuadorian government. The I M F ’ s Stand-By Arrangement provided the overall
macroeconomic framework, with coordinated support via policy-based and investment lending by the
IDB, the CAF, and the World Bank. Coordination was close and productive. For example, in the
financial sector a joint policy matrix was developed for the four International Financial Institutions (IFIs).
In addition, coordination at the field level by the respective Resident Representatives has been strong.
More recently, in addition to regular exchanges, the Bank has invited IMF staff to attend Ecuador Day,
CAS consultations, Initiating Memorandum and Regional Operational Committee (ROC) Reviews of
Adjustment Loans, and Bankwide and ROC reviews of the CAS. Bank staff have been invited to attend

In i t s March 13, 2003 Supplemental Letter that the GOE submitted to the Fund, it proposed the following
three key changes to i t s February 10th Letter o f Intent (LOI). First, the 2003 budget, while respecting the
primary and overall balances, was adjusted upward to $42 mln, or less than 1% o f total revenues.
Congress had also approved that education spending could increase by $165 mln, but only provided the
level o f non-interest spending in the budget remain consistent with the limit o f the Fiscal Law. Second,
payment o f all non-reschedulable arrears to the Paris Club, in agreement with the Paris Club, was deferred
by two weeks and therefore completed five working days prior to the IMF Board meeting, rather than the
two weeks agreed in the LOI. Hence, the GOE requested that despite the delay, this condition be
considered met. And finally, the government requested an extension o f the time period to a) complete the
signing o f contracts with companies to manage the Filanbanco liquidation trust funds and b) to audit o f at
least 8 closed banks in the Deposit Guarantee Agency. In former case, delays were caused because the
f i r m s interested in the trust funds needed more time to conduct their own due diligence. In latter, the
government had recently appointed new management to the AGD and this had led to delays in
progressing as schedule.
