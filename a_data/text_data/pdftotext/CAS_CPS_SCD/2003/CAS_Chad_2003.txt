EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

1. Since the last C A S was presented to the Board in M a y 23, 2000 (IDA\R99-115),
construction o f the Chad-Cameroon o i l pipeline began and was completed one year ahead o f
schedule and within budget. I t was the result o f a unique partnership including inter alia two
countries, three o i l companies, and the W o r l d Bank Group. Oil revenues began accruing in
November 2003 and could increase budget revenues by well over half. They represent an
exceptional opportunity for Chad, which has already put in place an unprecedented Petroleum
Revenue Management Program, the most striking features o f which are: predefined rules for the
use o f these revenues; an independent oversight body; and mechanisms to stabilize spending over
time and mitigate inflationary pressures. The country i s one o f the world’s poorest, with
strikingly l o w indicators o f well-being and access to basic services. The UNDP’s human
development index (HDI) ranks Chad among the world’s 10 poorest countries.
2. The over-arching objective o f this Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) i s to help Chad make
the best possible developmental use o f i t s new o i l revenues (and public resources more broadly)
as it strives to attain the MDGs. The C A S has two areas o f focus-its pillars. The first i s
strengthening governance, including institutional arrangements for public resource management
and service delivery, the rule o f law, and environmental and social safeguards for o i l exploitation.
The second i s enhancing non-oil economic opportunities while reducing sources o f vulnerability,
notably for the poor, in part by ensuring a conducive macroeconomic framework and alleviating
infrastructure constraints. The two pillars o f the C A S reflect the Bank’s comparative advantage,
and are fully consistent with the Strategic Framework for IDA’SAssistance to Africa and with
IDA’SRegional Integration Assistance Strategy for the C E M A C region.
3. The strategy for Chad sets out planned lending and non-lending support to the country from
the W o r l d Bank Group over the period FY04-06, including base-case IDA lending o f around
US$128 m i l l i o n over the three years. I t uses a results-based framework to establish h o w new
lending and the existing portfolio will contribute to achieving the outcomes proposed in this CAS.
4.

The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:
Does the Board agree with the CAS’S proposed balance between human and institutional
capacity-building for o i l revenue management and service delivery, and the need to
improve conditions for private-sector-led growth and rural development?
0 Does the Board concur with the approach proposed in the C A S o f gradual transition to
consolidated programmatic lending through PRSCs by FY06, as a recognition o f progress
towards improving public financial management?
0

5. Bank Group assistance i s fully aligned with the agenda detailed in the country’s recentlycompleted PRSP which was presented t o the Board o n November 13, 2003 (IDA/SecM/0543).
Chad’s PRSP was based o n extensive consultations and offers a credible analysis o f poverty, the
constraints to reducing it, and the needed policy and institutional responses (including those
pertaining to o i l revenue management). The strategy proposed in the PRSP builds upon five
principles (or “axes”): promoting good governance, ensuring strong and sustained economic
growth, improving human capital, improving the l i v i n g conditions o f vulnerable groups, and
restoring and safeguarding ecosystems. The m a i n challenge underlying PRSP implementation i s
one o f strengthening institutional arrangements and capacity for improved governance, notably in
managing the new o i l revenues, to help Chad meet the MDGs through better delivery o f basic
public services, and o f creating income-earning opportunities for the poor through broad-based
non-oil growth.
6.

The following measurable improvements are expected by the end o f the C A S period:
0
Public resources, particularly o i l revenues, will be managed transparently and
accountably.

K e y aspects o f the r u l e o f l a w will be strengthened.
Producers will be able to get products to market more cost-effectively and agricultural
productivity will have increased.
K e y infrastructure, such as paved roads, electricity and urban sanitation will have
improved.
Communities and vulnerable groups will be empowered in local development initiatives
and the delivery o f selected basic services (health, education and water) will be
improved.
7. The B a n k Group’s existing portfolio-which
includes operations supporting health,
education, transport, electricity and water services, HIV/AIDS, and domestic energy, as w e l l as
two capacity-building projects accompanying the pipeline project-is contributing centrally to the
attainment o f these results by improving Chad’s absorptive capacity in priority sectors. These
efforts will be complemented by selective new IDA lending o f U S 1 2 8 m i l l i o n in the base case
over FY04-06. F Y 0 4 lending w o u l d consist o f an Agricultural Services and Producer
Organizations Project (ASPOP) to provide support to increase agricultural productivity; a Local
Development Program Support Project (PROADEL)-to
which the US$17 m i l l i o n allocated in
grant t o Chad for F Y 0 4 will be fully applied-to
help channel public resources to rural
communities; an Institutional Reform Support Credit (IRSC) to support the ongoing structural
and govemance reform program; and additional financing for capacity-building supported under
the Management o f the Petroleum Economy Project in order to extend and deepen critical
technical assistance in procurement and public expenditure management, provide technical
assistance for structural reforms, and support the petroleum revenue management oversight
committee. FY05 lending would entail an urban project-to w h i c h the expected F Y 0 5 grant
allocation will be applied-to provide basic infrastructure in poor neighborhoods in N’djamena
and some secondary cities, as w e l l as a reintegration project for ex-combatants t o support
government efforts to improve security. In FY06, a PRSC w o u l d b e put in place subject to
attaining specific results in public expenditure management. In parallel, over FY04-06 IFC’s
S M E and micro-credit programs will continue to strengthen the technical and financial capacity
o f SMEs and expand access t o finance. These will be complemented by support for private
infrastructure provision where possible.
8. Analytical and advisory activities (AAA) will focus o n the fiduciary aspects o f public
resource management. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in FY04, annual
public expenditure reviews (PERs), and an integrative CEM/DPR in FY05, will help determine
whether Chad i s ready for a PRSC. The ongoing expenditure tracking surveys and beneficiary
assessments will be completed in FY04, and local capacity built for their regular repetition. An
Investment Climate Assessment and a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) are
scheduled for FY06. Continuous assessment o f the impact o f cotton reforms will be pursued, and
an FY05 poverty assessment w i t h a focus o n gender will help measure progress toward the PRSP
objectives. Also in FY05, an analysis o f the financial sector will deepen understanding o f
financing constraints o n private business. As a rule, AAA work will endeavor to build capacity
through j o i n t w o r k with Chadian counterparts and wide dissemination. Capacity-building
initiatives-including a comprehensive diagnosis and inventory o f gaps in the first instance-is a
central feature o f W o r l d Bank Group assistance, notably through the W o r l d Bank Institute (-1).
9 . Base case lending will be conditional o n satisfactory implementation o f the PRSP, o n
governance measures, and o n IDA portfolio quality. Serious breaches o f the o i l revenue
management program in particular w o u l d trigger a low-case lending scenario. A high-case
lending scenario would be triggered by stronger performance o n expenditure management.

10. Risks t o C A S implementation include geopolitical risks o f spillovers from potential
turbulence in Chad’s neighbors. The B a n k Group cannot directly influence such risks, but it can

- 11 -

support the strengthening o f institutional arrangements for good governance. Other risks include:
(i)waning Government commitment to the petroleum revenue management program-and to
reforms more generally-once o i l revenues come in, which can be mitigated by continuing a
close dialogue, by supporting c i v i l society’s role in monitoring the spending o f o i l revenues
through regular publication o f budget execution data and audit reports, as w e l l as through
improved expenditure tracking systems, and by spotlighting the low-case lending triggers; (ii)
those o f social unrest if expectations o f “the promise o f oil” (tangible results such as in the f o r m
o f infrastructure improvements) go unfulfilled, as w e l l as risks o f divisiveness in the country
more generally, given the fragility o f the “national” esprit de corps and the legacy o f conflict; and
finally (iii)
unexpected declines in o i l prices, though these will be substantially mitigated by the
stabilization mechanism that Chad has established.

I- INTRODUCTION
1. This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY04-06 covers a period that will mark a
fundamental transformation o f the Chadian economy as the country becomes an o i l producer and
exporter. Oil was first discovered in the 1950s, the first exploration well was drilled in the early
1970s, but it was only this year that o i l could actually be produced. The Chad-Cameroon pipeline
was finished one year ahead o f schedule, o i l pumping began in July 2003, the first shipment was
sold in October 2003, and revenues began accruing in November 2003. Full production o f
225,000 barrels per day should be achieved by April 2004. First expenditures out o f o i l revenues
will take place within the 2004 budget. Oil revenues are currently forecast to be around US$lOO
m i l l i o n in that year.

2. The over-arching objective o f this Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) i s to help Chad make
the best possible developmental use o f i t s new o i l revenues (and public resources more broadly)
as i t strives to attain the MDGs. T h e CAS has t w o areas o f focus-its pillars. T h e first i s
strengthening governance, including public resource management and institutional arrangements
for service delivery, the rule o f law, and environmental and social safeguards for o i l exploitation.
The second i s enhancing non-oil economic opportunities while reducing sources o f vulnerability,
notably for the poor, in part by creating a conducive macroeconomic framework and alleviating
infrastructure constraints. The two pillars o f the CAS are fully aligned with the agenda detailed
in the country’s recently-completed PRSP, reflect the Bank’s comparative advantage, and are
embedded within the Strategic Framework for IDA’s Assistance to Africa and IDA’s Regional
Integration Assistance Strategy for the C E M A C region.
3. The CAS sets out planned lending and non-lending support t o Chad from the W o r l d Bank
Group over the period FY04-06. The three-year C A S period was determined for conformity with
the PRSP, which details a poverty reduction action plan and targets through 2006. Support under
the C A S includes base-case IDA lending o f US$128 m i l l i o n over the three years and continuing
support for SME development and possibly for private infrastructure development through the
IFC. The CAS uses a results-based framework t o establish h o w n e w lending and the existing
portfolio will contribute to achieving the outcomes proposed. Analytical and advisory activities
will focus o n the fiduciary aspects o f effective public resource management. IDA lending will be
subject to low- and high-case scenarios, with specific associated triggers. Finally, capacitybuilding initiatives-including a comprehensive diagnosis and inventory o f gaps in the first
instance-is a central feature o f planned W o r l d Bank Group assistance, notably through the
W o r l d Bank Institute (WBI).

11 COUNTRY CONTEXT

(i)Geographical, political and social context
4. Chad i s a large, sparsely populated country with many areas o f difficult terrain and
significant cultural and social diversity, which pose a challenge to the social fabric and political
stability. With a surface area o f 1.284 m i l l i o n square hlometres, it i s the fifth largest country in
Africa but has a population o f only 8.1 million, mainly concentrated in the more favorable
agricultural areas in the south. The country7s ecological zones range from tropical in the South,
semi-arid in the Sahelian belt, to a semi-desert and desert area in the North. As regards social and
cultural diversity, the picture i s more complex than the oft-cited distinction between Northern
“Muslims” and Southern “Christians”: diversity runs along many different lines between
nomadic, semi-nomadic and sedentary groups; between cattle herders, traders and agriculturists;

-1-

between Saharans, Sahelians and Southerners, and along extended family and clan lines. Chad
has about 200 ethnic groups and 120 distinct languages. Beginning a few years after
independence in 1960, the country suffered intermittent bouts o f c i v i l war over more than two
decades, as different factions (often with surreptitious external support) alternated in power and
contested the country’s leadership by violent means.

5. There has, however, been steady, if gradual, progress in recovery from the conflicts o f the
past and in democratization. The country has been largely stable since the beginning o f the
1990s. The presidential elections o f 200 1 were the second multi-party presidential elections,
resulting in the election o f the incumbent, President Idriss Dkby, for a second five-year term. The
Government has promoted national reconciliation and encouraged opposition leaders to return.
Overall, there has been steady recovery over at least the past decade from the preceding period o f
episodic c i v i l war. Nevertheless, the threat t o political stability has not been entirely
eliminated-Chad has a long history o f rebellions, and some neighboring countries, such as the
Central African Republic and Sudan, face recurrent instability. Further, by raising the potential
stakes associated with political power, the impending o i l revenues risk making the maintenance
o f political stability even more o f a challenge.

(ii)Macroeconomic t r a c k record
6. Chad has by and large maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic track record over the last
C A S period (see Table 1). Despite unfavorable world prices for cotton, Chad’s main export
product, as w e l l as repeated droughts which have significantly affected agricultural production,
growth has been buoyed by oil-related investments and their spillover effects. Real GDP growth,
at a weak 0.6 percent in 2000, resumed briskly in 2001 (8.5 percent), and accelerated further in
2002 (9.7 percent). Inflationary pressures emerged in 2001 but were reduced in 2002 and
subsided further in 2003. Still, this domestic inflation and the appreciation o f the Euro, to which
the F C F A i s linked, led to a real exchange rate appreciation. Past stability notwithstanding,
maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies will be crucial as o i l revenues begin flowing in.
Towards this, in July 2003, the Chadian authorities formally established a mechanism to stabilize
budgeted expenditures to be financed by volatile o i l revenues and to sterilize any excess liquidity.

7. Fiscal policy has been broadly consistent with macroeconomic objectives. The overall
deficit, on a commitment basis and excluding grants, was reduced slightly f r o m 12.3 percent o f

-2-

GDP in 2000 t o 11 percent in 2001, then widened to 12.2 percent o f GDP in 2002, reflecting an
increase in foreign-financed public investment. At the same time, the primary base deficit
excluding grants-the overall fiscal deficit excluding debt-service payments and foreign-financed
investment-rose from 1.7 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 2.4 percent o f GDP in 2002, reflecting the
impact o f higher transfers to the cotton sector in the wake o f the drop in the w o r l d market price
for cotton. Total Government revenue, excluding grants, remained close t o 8 percent o f GDP
during this period and i s expected to reach 8.3 percent o f GDP in 2003. As a share o f non-oil
GDP, the revenue ratio rose by 0.7 percentage point in 2002 and i s expected t o increase by 0.1
percentage point in 2003, reflecting significant efforts to strengthen tax and customs
administration under the ongoing reform program.
8. On the expenditure side, total expenditures remained broadly around 20 percent o f GDP in
the period 2000-2002. Since 1994, the Government has consistently increased budget allocations
t o education, health, public works and justice. However, budget execution in these priority
sectors remains slow. Liquidity constraints have often led the Government to delay priority
expenditures, generally until external financing was disbursed. A catch up o f these priority
expenditures has been programmed in the revised 2003 budget law. Meanwhile, improvements in
service provision in the priority sectors have been slow to materialize.
9. Chad remains under an IMF program. A three-year PRGF arrangement was approved o n
January 7, 2000, for an amount o f SDR 36.4 million, which was subsequently increased to SDR
47.6 million. In June 2003, following misreporting o n external payment arrears accumulated in
2002, the IMF Board requested the repayment o f SDR 5.4 m i l l i o n (about U S 7 . 6 million) in two
equal installments. The fifth review was concluded o n July 22, 2003, and the commitment under
the current arrangement period was extended t o January 6,2004.

10. Chad reached the decision point under the Enhanced H I P C Debt Initiative in M a y 2001. The
Government approved i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) on June 4,2003. The PRSP,
along with a Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), was discussed by the W o r l d Bank and IMF Boards in
November 2003. Provided that vigorous efforts are made towards achieving the triggers, notably
in the social and rural development sectors, and that the country maintains a satisfactory
macroeconomic track record during the first year o f PRSP implementation, Chad could possibly
reach the HIPC completion point around June 2004.

(iii)Petroleum revenue management, expenditure accountability and quality of
public administration
11. Past experience in several developing countries suggests that transparency and
accountability shortcomings risk being key hindrances to broad-based development in Chad as it
acquires revenues from oil.' Accordingly, the Petroleum Revenue Management Programunprecedented among developing countries, and enshrined in Chadian law-provides
for very
detailed institutional arrangements to ensure considerable transparency and accountability in the
use o f o i l revenues? Funds will initially f l o w through an offshore escrow account, then to a

'

The current outlook for oil production (from three fields at Doba in southem Chad), which began in the summer of
2003, i s some 225,000 barrels per day, a level expected to be reached by Spring 2004. By way o f illustration
(depending inter alia on oil prices), oil receipts could increase Govemment revenue by over half.

The provisions o f the Petroleum Revenue Management Law o f I999 were further completed and refined in the IBRD
Loan Agreement approved by Parliament in 2000, and through several implementation decrees approved by the
Govemment in 2003. For simplicity's sake, whenever the Petroleum Revenue Management Program i s mentioned in
this CAS, it refers to all legal provisions in force.

special petroleum revenue account, both subject to audits. Spending out o f the special revenue
account i s subject to approval by an independent oversight committee, the Coll2ge de ContrGle et
de Surveillance des Ressources Pe'troli2res (CCSRP). The CCSRP's mandate i s to ensure that
budgetary allocations conform t o Program rules, and to authorize a l l payments made from the
Special Oil Revenue Account. The CCSRP has nine members: four members from c i v i l society
(one representative each from a development NGO, a human rights association, the trade unions,
and the religious communities), two members o f Parliament, a Supreme Court judge, the Director
o f the Treasury, and the National Director o f BEAC. The latter two are ex ofJicio members. All
the other members are chosen by their peers.
12. The Program specifies that 10 percent o f royalties and dividends (so-called direct o i l
revenues3) are t o be saved in a Future Generations Fund (FGF), subject to prudential rules and
investment arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. The proceeds o f these investments will be
used to benefit poverty reduction objectives. The remainder i s t o be spent as follows: 80 percent
o f royalties and 85 percent o f dividends for expenditures in the priority sectors (health and social
affairs, education, infrastructure, rural development, and environment and water resources), 5
percent o f royalties t o decentralized authorities in the oil-producing region, and up to December
31, 2007, the remainder to finance Government spending in the non-sovereign sectors for
pressing operational needs. After December 31, 2007, the remainder shall be used t o finance
expenditures in priority poverty sectors. As illustrated in Figure 1, the bulk o f revenues will f l o w
into the Stabilization Account and will be released in quarterly increments t o finance planned
expenditures in priority sectors. Revenues in excess o f planned spending (say, from higher-thanexpected o i l prices) will be saved in the Stabilization Account in order t o be used during years
when revenues are unexpectedly lower, for example because o f a decline in o i l prices.
Sterilization measures (whereby the bulk o f revenues are kept at B E A C and released in quarterly
increments) will be taken to avoid the inflationary pressures o f a revenue windfall.

13. Over the past few months, the Government’s focus has been o n fine-tuning the detailed
modalities for the Petroleum Revenue Management Program. Implementation decrees have been
a stabilization mechanism to save revenues in excess o f planned spending
drawn up to specify: (i)
(e.g., from higher-than-expected o i l prices) to make expenditures predictable and enhance their
effectiveness, as w e l l as to protect priority expenditure programs in the face o f o i l price volatility;
(ii)
a sterilization mechanism to guard against excess liquidity in the economy as a result o f the
foreign exchange inflows; (iii)
the management o f the funds deposited in the Future Generations
Fund (FGF) as w e l l as conditions o f withdrawal from the FGF4; and (iv) the h c t i o n i n g o f the
oversight committee (CCSRP). The modalities for the allocation o f 5 percent o f o i l revenues to
the elected local govemments o f the oil-producing area have yet t o b e defined. Due to delayed
implementation o f the decentralization program, such elected local govemments do not yet exist,
although municipal elections are expected to take place in the near future.
14. Accountability mechanisms are being strengthened, and transparency in public financial
management has improved over the period o f the last CAS. The CCSRP i s n o w h l l y operational
and i s expected to ensure a high degree o f scrutiny in the management o f oil revenues. T h e
auditor general’s office, despite few resources, has produced several audit reports, a l l o f relatively
satisfactory quality. The Govemment has begun publishing, for the first time, several important
audit reports, such as the audits o f the o i l signature bonus, o f the public procurement contracts,
and o f the use o f HIPC resources-a major and commendable step forward in transparency. T h i s
progress notwithstanding, effective enforcement o f accountability and sanction mechanisms i s
s t i l l in need o f significant strengthening and streamlining.
15. Over the past three years, the authorities have begun comprehensive reforms to strengthen
the arrangements for budget preparation, execution and reporting and to build the relevant
capacity. These reforms have been supported by the W o r l d Bank, the IMF, the European Union,
and other donors. A comprehensive budget classification system has been functioning since
2001. With respect to budget monitoring, the Government has defined an action plan to improve
the expenditure tracking system in health and education, although implementation has lagged.
An institutional and organizational audit o f key ministries has been completed and i s expected to
be followed up by reforms in organizational structures, business processes and staffing. In
addition, an important step was recently taken with the establishment o f Administrative and
Finance Directorates in each ministry. Generally, however, business processes remain
cumbersome and need to be further simplified and streamlined.

(iv) Regional dimension
16. Chad stands t o benefit m u c h f r o m i t s membership in CEMAC’ (Communautd Economique et
Mondtaire d ’Afrique Centrale), an economic and monetary union that also comprises Cameroon,
the Central A f h c a n Republic, the Republic o f Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. Chad
accounts for a quarter o f the population o f the C E M A C but only 7 percent o f the region’s GDP.
Potential benefits o f closer CEMAC integration-as
yet largely unrealized-include
more

Direct oil revenues are projected to be by far the dominant portion o f revenues over the first few years o f production.
Indirect revenues-largely income taxes-will likely grow in importance thereafter, depending on o i l prices.
At the time o f the writing, this decree was under preparation / approval.

C E M A C evolved f r o m a loose customs union to a full-fledged economic and monetary union in 1994 (treaty ratified
in 1999). The C E M A C countries share a common Central Bank (BEAC) and currency (the C F A Franc).

-5 -

developed trade, through the costumes union and infrastructure links, in addition to the potential
safeguards o n macroeconomic discipline o f a common currency (the C F A franc) under the
oversight o f the common central Bank, BEAC. C E M A C countries, including Chad, have signed
a Pacte de Convergence, de StabilitR de Croissance et Solidaritk, which commits all member
countries to achieve macroeconomic convergence, and for this purpose to comply with specific
criteria that were spelled out in a Regional Directive dated August 3,200 1. In 200 1, Chad did not
comply with any o f the four main criteria, but the situation has since improved and Chad
complied with two criteria in 2002. Better compliance with the convergence criteria becomes
especially important for Chad as it enters the petroleum era.
17. As a landlocked country that relies o n i t s coastal neighbor for trade and transport links, Chad
has established close relations with Cameroon in several areas, including those related to marine
access through the port o f Douala. The Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project has
strengthened and broadened these links, not only with respect to infrastructure (in addition to the
pipeline itself, the associated road upgrading i s facilitating Chadian access t o Cameroon’s road
and railway networks, and onward to Douala; a fiber optic cable has also been installed along the
pipeline), but also at the institutional and political level. The C E M A C Regional Integration
Assistance Strategy and the Cameroon CAS will provide j o i n t and complementary support for the
development o f this corridor that i s so critical t o Chad.
18. Economic relations with other immediate neighbors have been somewhat limited, owing in
some cases t o political instability in the countries (e.g., the Central African Republic), and the
lack o f transport infrastructure (Nigeria, CAR, Niger). For example, Chad has been unable to
capitalize o n i t s clear comparative advantage in sectors such as cattle rearing and beef production,
for which countries like Nigeria offer a potentially very significant export market. However,
technical cooperation among the countries has taken root in several areas. Such cooperation has
been established with Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Niger and Nigeria o n
environmental management for the Lake Chad area through the establishment and j o i n t operation
o f the Lake Chad Basin Commission, which the W o r l d Bank Group i s supporting through a GEF
grant.
111- POVERTY PROFILE

19. Chad’s l o w per capita income o f less than U S 2 5 0 per year i s also reflected in strikingly l o w
indicators o f well-being across the board. M o r e than h a l f o f the population over the age o f 15 i s
illiterate, and there i s only one doctor for every 29,000 inhabitants. Access t o improved sources
o f potable water i s limited to three out o f every ten people, electricity i s accessible to only 1
percent o f the population, and there are only some 550 lulometers o f paved road o n a surface area
o f over 1.2 m i l l i o n square kilometers. Gender-related indicators are particularly low, with
maternal mortality estimated at 827 per 100,000 live births, and the ratio o f girls’ to boys’ school
enrollment at 63 percent in the year 2000. Epidemic and endemic diseases, such as cholera,
typhoid and malaria, are prevalent in a l l regions o f the country, with the latter disease being a
leading cause o f mortality. The incidence o f H I V / A I D S increased alarmingly in the latter h a l f o f
the 199Os, although preliminary recent data suggest a slowing or even a reversal o f this tendency
during the past t w o years.

-6-

20. The incidence o f poverty in Chad (defined as the proportion o f households with annual
spending below what i s necessary to meet minimal food and non-food needs6) i s estimated at 43.4
percent o n the basis o f the 1995-1996 household survey. The depth o f poverty (which measures
the percentage by which the average poor household falls short o f the poverty line) i s estimated at
27.5 percent, which i s high by comparative standards. Using a more cross-country definition o f
the poverty line, an estimated four-fifths o f the population o f about 8 m i l l i o n lives o n less than a
dollar a day, and one in two people lives o n less than 50 cents per day.
21. Gender disparities and lack o f integration o f many regions are the most strikmg correlates o f
poverty in Chad, as revealed by the 1995-96 household survey:'
0

M o r e women are poor, and poorer than men. Poverty strikes women in Chad more-and
more deeply-than it strikes their male compatriots. Of households headed by a woman,
54 percent are poor, compared with 34 percent for those headed by a man. Female heads
o f household have fewer resources, and lower qualifications, than men, limiting their
access to remunerated work, especially in rural areas. Female illiteracy rates stand at
about 95 percent, and 77 percent o f women have had no schooling. Fertility rates are
very high (6.8 children per woman), and fewer than 4 percent o f women use any form o f
contraception.

0

The various agro-climatic regions are poorly integrated. The limited availability o f yearround transport has created numerous agricultural enclaves, where the high cost o f
transport hinders the i n f l o w o f inputs and consumer goods t o rural areas, while
hampering the outflow o f production to food-deficit regions and urban centers. The
Salamat and the Lake Chad regions, potential "breadbaskets", remain largely
unreachable by larger vehicles for up to five months every year. Transport charges can
be as much as 70 percent o f marketing costs and 30 t o 80 percent o f gross margins o f
local cereal prices in N'djamena. Due to erratic rainfall pattems, food deficit and surplus
regions change from season to season.

22. As indicated in the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) for the PRSP, the extensive participatory
process in the preparation o f the PRSP helped identify the m a i n vulnerabilities and constraints as
perceived by the poor. These include the legacy o f the country's long period o f conflict, such as
unexploded landmines, readily available small arms, improperly reintegrated ex-combatants and
regionally concentrated factions; poor govemance and public resource management; competition
for natural resources; geographic isolation and high transport costs; l o w returns to farmers from
cotton and other major products; the failure o f social services to reach many groups; and the lack
o f balance in gender roles. In particular, the need t o improve govemance and security as
prerequisites for effective implementation o f the PRSP i s clearly reflected throughout the
document.
23. The PRSP aims to reduce poverty to below h a l f the estimated 1995 level by 2015, in line
with the MDGs. The strategy rightly emphasizes the Government's commitment to ensure that
o i l revenues are used for poverty reduction. PRSP objectives and prospects t o reach MDGs are
summarized in Table 2 below.

For the whole o f the area covered by the household survey, this (daily) level was estimated at CFAF 253, well below
the international standard poverty line of one dollar per person per day (about CFAF 700).

'

Note that some o f the indicators (e.g., on girls' schooling) have evolved considerably since the 1995-96 survey
results. A new household survey round i s currently underway.

-7-

24. Poverty Monitoring. T h e PRSP includes a vaned and ambitious time-bound l i s t o f new
statistical surveys to be conducted over 2003-05, notably with the support o f the Bank. The
National Statistics Institute (INSEED) will be responsible for such surveys in coordination with
the ministries concemed. Surveys will involve the collection o f qualitative as well as statistical
data, and, as far as possible, these will be analyzed jointly with the results o f the household
survey (ECOSIT 1I) survey, currently being conducted with the support o f the Management o f the
Petroleum Economy Project. However, to strengthen i t s performance and accomplish i t s mission,
the National Statistics Institute needs greater human and financial resources. In addition to the
ongoing support from the Bank and from the UNDP, the need for considerable external support
will continue. In this context, it will be helpful that Chad i s a participant in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS), which provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating data
improvement needs and measuring progress in poverty reduction consistent with the Millennium
Development Goals.

1v - NATIONAL
PRIORITIES FOR POVERTY REDUCTION
(i)Country priorities and agenda
25. Chad’s development agenda and strategic objectives have been outlined in i t s PRSP, adopted
in June 2003. The Government’s strategy stresses the need for financial and political stability in
the new o i l era. I t proposes t o cut poverty in h a l f by 2015. T o reach this aim, it develops a
macroeconomic framework and five axes stratdgiques (strategic orientations), underlying each o f

-8-

which i s a set o f general and more specific objectives, together with the investments and other
actions needed to meet them:
0
Improve the social, judicial, political and economic environment.
0
Ensure rapid and sustained economic growth.
0
Build human capital.
0
Improve living conditions for vulnerable groups.
0
Safeguard and restore ecosystems.
26. The JSA concurs with the strategic priorities o f the PRSP, and it considers that the proposed
2004-06 action program outlined in the PRSP provides a sound and feasible first step in their
implementation. Most key actions are integrated into ongoing macroeconomic, sectoral, or
thematic programs, often with donor support, and it i s therefore likely that the strategy will
receive the resources needed for timely implementation. However, achieving the main PRSP
objective o f halving poverty by 2015 through inclusive growth will depend critically o n the
quality o f governance, pro-poor economic and social policy choices, and the judicious selection
o f programs and projects. Overall, it will be critical to ensure that sustained emphasis i s placed
o n reforms t o promote governance and maintain support for agreed programs, including
increasing transparency in public procurement, and that capacities are built both at the national
and local levels to implement the priority programs identified in the PRSP. In addition, increasing
the level o f poverty-reducing spending and improving the quality o f public service delivery in
priority areas will be key for poverty reduction. As underlined in the JSA o f the PRSP, a very
important challenge for Chad will also be to promote growth in the non-oil sectors and increase
non-oil revenues to ensure that resources for implementing the PRSP remain adequate when o i l
revenues start declining.

(ii)Economic outlook
27. Medium-term prospects. Chad’s medium-term growth prospects are good as o i l exploitation
will profoundly change Chad’s economic environment. A s indicated in the macroeconomic
framework described in the PRSP, if o i l prices remain at around US$25/bbl,Chad would stand to
earn about US$5 billion over the duration o f Doba o i l field exploitation. It i s currently estimated
that o i l revenues would be in the range o f US$lOO-130 m i l l i o n in 2004, depending o n the exact
level o f o i l prices, and about US$160 m i l l i o n in 2005 and 2006. These new o i l revenues are
projected t o bring Chad’s annual real GDP growth to about 40 percent in 2004 and 15 percent in
2005 from i t s current projected level o f 11 percent in 2003. Growth would then stabilize at about
4-5 percent in subsequent years over the period up to 20 15. T h i s scenario assumes that Chad will
be able to design and implement policies t o ensure strong, sustained growth in the non-oil sector
(averaging over 6 percent per annum in real terms in 2006-2015), driven in particular by rapid
growth in manufacturing (7-8 percent per year) and construction and public works (9-1 1 percent
per year). Growth in services over 2004-20 15 would also be rapid, around 6-7 percent per year. It
i s assumed that growth in the primary sector would be slightly slower, averaging about 4 percent
per year over the medium to long term, driven by the agricultural sector, especially food crops.
28. The primary base deficit-the overall fiscal deficit excluding debt-service payments and
foreign-financed investment-is projected in the PRSP to improve from a projected 2.8 percent o f
GDP in 2003 (excluding grants) to an average o f 1.5 percent over 2004-2015. As a percentage o f
non-oil GDP, the primary base deficit excluding o i l revenues would remain broadly unchanged,
ranging from about 2.2 to 2.9 percent per annum.
29. Chad’s external environment i s relatively favorable for the next three years despite the
country’s high dependence o n few export products (oil, cotton, cattle) and i t s vulnerability to
fluctuating world prices for commodities. Over the last C A S period, Chad had to cope with a

-9-

decline in cotton prices. Terms o f trade are estimated to have declined by more than 10 percent
in 2002. Nevertheless, this negative trend has recently been slightly reversed. The current
account deficit, including official current transfers, reached 38.3 percent o f GDP in 2001 and
increased to 56.5 percent in 2002, reflecting both an increase in imports associated with pipeline
construction and lower exports (partly due to a decline in the world market price for cotton). The
current account deficit i s expected to decline to 35.4 percent in 2003, 10.2 percent in 2004 and
3.7 percent in 2005, driven by o i l and cotton exports as well as by a decline in pipeline-related
imports.

30. The experience o f other oil-producing countries in Africa and the so-called “paradox o f
abundance’’ call for prudent macroeconomic policies in Chad. The macroeconomic scenario
presented in the PRSP assumes that policies would be implemented to contain inflation at about 4
percent per year o n average over the period 2003-20 15 and avoid an over-appreciation o f the real
exchange rate. Nevertheless, inability to control aggregate demand could lead to inflation and
excessive appreciation o f the real exchange rate, resulting in a shrinkage o f the non-oil tradable
sectors (including the cotton sector) which could undermine sustained economic growth. T h i s i s a
serious risk which i s partially mitigated by Chad’s membership in the regional Central-African
economic and monetary union (CEMAC), which has a fixed-exchange rate arrangement with the
Euro, backed by the French Treasury--regional monetary policy i s carried out independently by
BEAC, the regional Central Bank-as w e l l as by the sterilization and stabilization mechanisms.
3 1. The newly-established stabilization and sterilization mechanisms a i m at limiting excess
liquidity in the economy and at reducing excessive exposure o f government expenditures to the
variability o f o i l prices. In particular, both the Future Generations Fund and the strict rules for
allocating the bulk o f the o i l revenues t o the priority areas are aimed at avoiding spill-over into
excessive wage-bill growth (one o f the main transmission mechanism for D u t c h Disease) and at
preventing unsustainable increases in public investments. All revenues in excess o f planned
expenditures (determined within a medium-term expenditure framework consistent with longterm macroeconomic objectives and sustainable long-term poverty-reducing spending plans) will
be saved in a Stabilization Account at the B E A C . A critical challenge for Chad will be to manage
the high expectations o f c i v i l servants for salary increases.

-10-

32. Debt and creditworthiness. Chad does not have a major external debt sustainability issue as
a result o f ongoing and planned debt relief under the H I P C initiative (see Annex 3). Currently, i t s
value o f debt to GDP i s quite high (69.8 percent), and debt service s t i l l represents about 20.2
percent o f exports o f goods and services. Nevertheless, in the medium term, o i l exploitation
would sharply improve external prospects. A major challenge for the authorities will be to
implement a careful and cautious external borrowing strategy despite the country’s new o i l
wealth.
33. Chad was assessed for assistance under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in July 2000, using
actual end-1999 external debt data. Based o n the preliminary DSA, Chad qualified for the
Enhanced H I P C Initiative as the country’s debt burden was found t o b e unsustainable even after
the full application o f all traditional debt relief mechanisms. The subsequent D S A at decision
point, w h i c h reflected the findings o f a j o i n t Bank-Fund mission undertaken in February 2001,
confirmed that Chad, with a N e t Present Value (NPV) o f debt-to-export ratio at end-2000 o f 214
percent after traditional debt relief, qualified for debt relief under the Enhanced H I P C Initiative.
To bring Chad’s NPV o f debt-to-export ratio to the sustainable target o f 150 percent in the base
year (end-December 2000), the total assistance under the Enhanced H I P C Initiative will amount
to US$170 m i l l i o n in NPV terms. Based o n proportional burden-sharing, under the proposed debt
relief program, the multilateral creditors’ share o f assistance o f HIPC assistance for Chad will
amount to US$134 m i l l i o n in NPV terms, o f which US$68 m i l l i o n will be attributable t o amounts
owed to IDA. The bilateral and commercial creditors’ share will amount to US$36 m i l l i o n in
NPV terms. While the exact timing i s subject to progress in meeting the triggers, Chad could
reach the completion point around June o f 2004.

v-

CHAD’S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES

(i)Weak institutions and governance, though there has been recent progress in
strengthening them
34. With its legacy o f conflict, Chad i s s t i l l developing an appropriate institutional framework,
in particular t o manage i t s public resources. The lack o f formal controls at the central and
regional levels, especially with the country’s geographical fragmentation, has often led to misuse
o f power and public funds. With the n e w o i l resources, it becomes a l l the more important to
remedy institutional weaknesses that might otherwise lead to even more corruption. In addition to
constraining effective management o f public resources, corruption and non-transparent practices
also constrain private sector development. The governance environment has tended to foster a
local private sector dependent o n patronage, in which political connections are more important
determinants o f business success than managerial competence. In August 2002, the Government
adopted a National Strategy for Good Governance. The strategy calls for transparent and
participatory management o f economic and social development process by the central and
decentralized public administration together with the private sector and c i v i l society.
35. Public finance management reform. In 2002, audits o f the contracts financed with HIPC
interim assistance and other contracts uncovered continuing problems in managing public funds.
Procurement regulations were often ignored, resulting in over-billing. The quality o f expenditure
was poor, with more emphasis o n the needs o f the central administration and less o n improving
basic service delivery. There were also several instances o f corruption and embezzlement o f
supplies intended for local facilities. Without downplaying the seriousness o f the corruption
issues that these audits brought to light, it should be noted that the satisfactory completion and
publication o f these audits i s a further concrete step towards increased transparency and, in effect,

- 11 -

have l e d the Government to take steps to address the problems. These have included the
establishment o f new administrative and finance directorates in sector ministries that will benefit
from on-going capacity-building initiatives, notably those supported by IDA. In April 2002, the
Government Iaunched the preparation o f a medium-term expenditure framework and program
budgets for the priority ministries. A first round o f this work has been completed in preparation
for the 2004 budget.

36. Public procurement reform. The Government has often acknowledged shortcomings in the
public procurement system. Public procurement procedures have been ill-defined and poorly

-12-

implemented, hindering the execution o f the budget. An unwieldy approval circuit involves the
highest authorities for fairly small procurement contracts. The public i s not systematically
informed about standard bidding documents, invitations to tender for bids, reference prices,
outcomes o f bidding procedures, appeals in the contract awarding process, or blacklisted firms.
In 2001, the Government launched a public procurement reform program t o improve the system.
The program provides for the enactment and publication o f a new Public Procurement Code,
which was adopted by the Council o f Ministers o n October 2, 2003. The Decree i s to be signed
shortly. The new regulation includes independent appeals procedures and the preparation,
publication, and dissemination o f standard bidding documents. A parallel objective i s to build
capacity in public procurement and improve transparency through annual audits o f contracts. The
program also provides for a computerized monitoring system for following up o n contracts.
37. Legal and judicial reform. Improving Chad's legal and judicial system remains one o f the
key elements to strengthen the rule o f law, assure property rights, and improve the environment
for private sector development. As indicated in the PRSP, actions are underway t o strengthen
parliamentary institutions, the judiciary, and respect for human rights. A public expenditure
review in the justice sector was carried out for the first time in 2002, and the principles for the
reform o f the judiciary system were laid out during the first Etats Gknkraux de la Justice
(National Forum for the sector with broad participation by all stakeholders including c i v i l society
from a l l regions o f the country) in June 2003.

38. Decentralization. In 1996 Chad adopted a constitution which inter alia provided for
decentralization in order to permit a more equitable and democratic distribution o f power among
citizens down to the lowest level o f local government and community groups. Over the last CAS
period, legislation was prepared to create three sub-national levels o f govemment-regional,
departmental and municipal-each with elected bodies.
The Government recognizes
decentralization as a catalyst for local initiatives and a means to promote good governance. But
the lack o f capacity o f communities hinders local accountability. And decentralization could also
pose a challenge t o stability and security. Furthermore, the full implications o f decentralization
reforms are s t i l l being fleshed out, with the following questions. H o w and in what f o r m will local
government structures be built up? H o w w i l l authority to spend public funds and generate
revenue be distributed across the three levels o f government? H o w will decentralization maintain
peace and security? H o w can the people be directly engaged in the fight against poverty in local
initiatives? These uncertainties notwithstanding, municipal elections are expected in the near
future.

(ii)Some successes, notably in the education sector, call for greater involvement o f
communities

39. The o i l development in the Doba basin has created important expectations among
communities. While the Government has tried to manage them, expectations remain high and
challenge the Government to use the o i l revenues to address poverty. Empowering communities
and channeling resources directly to them will be key, Some successes in the education sector
(see Box 2) demonstrate that increased community involvement in managing resources can
improve the delivery o f public services.
40. Development o f community participation. Several pilot community-driven initiatives,
including Bank-financed operations and funds (FOSAP, PSAP, FACIL), have shown that the
demand for community-driven projects i s high and that, i f adequately trained and monitored,
local groups are capable o f managing the subproject cycle, from needs assessment to payment o f
service providers. Such pilot initiatives have also shown that: (i)
a participatory approach to rural

- 13 -

socioeconomic infrastructure development improves the sustainability o f rural investments; and
disbursement efficiency i s paramount in acquiring and maintaining local interest and
that (ii)
dynamics. As highlighted in the PRSP, the Government explicitly recommends increasing the
participation o f rural communities in local development and envisions cooperation between
capable, representative local authorities and rural communities. The parties would collaborate in
the planning, implementation, and management o f their own development programs and directly
control the resources.

(iii)Developing the private sector in non-oil activities i s key to broadening the
sources of growth
41. Lack of very basic infrastructure and finance constitutes the most critical constraint to
private sector development. In roads, electricity, water, and telecommunications, Chad i s highly
deficient, even in comparison to other Sahelian counties. Transport charges can represent as
much as 70 percent o f marketing costs and from 30 to 80 percent o f the gross margin o f local
cereal prices in N’djamena. Chad’s power sector i s o n the verge o f collapsing; i t i s a major
bottleneck for economic and social development that will become increasingly severe as the
growth potential i s picking up. Access to electricity in urban N’djamena i s 8 percent, and the rest
o f the country i s almost totally deprived.* Chad has one o f the highest tariffs for electricity in the
world. Yet, power supply i s highly unreliable, power cuts are very frequent (250 days in 2002),
and the publicly-owned, but privately-managed, utility company depends o n state subsidies due to
the high cost o f imported diesel.
42. Business environment and private sector development. Improving the business
environment continues to be a key area o f focus for the Government. O f the US$440 m i l l i o n
spent o n local contracts under the Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, 43 percent was
put into Chad’s economy. Business development would receive a further boost from the
development o f other o i l fields. IFC implemented a program that was initially focused o n
technical assistance to Chadian f i r m s to help them participate in pipeline construction. However,
the need for more fundamental change in order to see any results was soon recognized. The
program was quickly broadened to a more comprehensive SME support program, incorporating

Theoretical power generation capacity in the N’djamena power station i s o f the order of 17 Megawatts; in practice,
however, frequent breakdowns in the outdated equipment often keeps actual capacity below 10 Megawatts.

-14-

general capacity-building, technical and managerial assistance, and improving access to finance
for Chadian firms. The small size o f the formal private sector in Chad-a few foreign f i r m s
involved in the larger enterprises, and a small number o f local private firms-compounded by a
daunting lack o f capacity and a history o f reliance o n patronage for survival, weakens the
potential private sector response to the increased opportunities represented by the o i l era. While
additional foreign investment may emerge to fill this gap, Chadian f i r m s will need additional
support and attention to removing constraints to foster their growth and expansion and help
generate more broad-based private sector growth. Access to finance i s also extremely limited due
owing to an underdeveloped banking sector with virtually n o non-bank financial intermediaries.
All banks have been privatized, and they generally respect the prudential regulations as
established by COBAC, the regional banking supervision commission. Yet, the banks are
generally not willing to take the risk o f extending medium- to long-term credit, and there i s n o
banking network outside the five main cities.
43. Challenges o f rural growth. Chad’s agricultural production, characterized by l o w yields
and l o w labor productivity, has good potential for improvement. Among Chad’s three main
ecological zones, the southemmost Sudanian zone offers the best agricultural potential, both for
food crops and for cash crops such as cotton, groundnuts, vegetables, and f r u i t s . For agriculture to
make a significant contribution to Chad’s long-term growth, the following areas need to be
addressed: inefficient agricultural marketing systems; weak producer organizations; fragile
ecosystems and declining soil fertility; poor delivery o f agricultural extension and research
services; inadequate capacity o f public-sector institutions; and vulnerability to climatic
conditions.
44. Cotton. A s the main source o f income for some 350,000 poor families, cotton i s one o f the
m a i n export products. But it has been hurt by the decline in w o r l d cotton prices, h i g h operating
costs, and the difficult financial situation o f the state-owned company, Cotontchad. A lack o f
maintenance o f rural roads has l e d to a significant increase in the costs o f Cotontchad. I t s
financial crisis and the drop in cotton prices has led to a reduction in cotton production, thereby
further increasing unit production costs because o f large fixed costs. A process has been launched
for the privatization o f Cotontchad. A Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) o f each of
the privatization scenarios was completed in the fall o f 2003. Given Cotontchad’s financial
problems, the Government has been more focused o n formulating an emergency rescue operation
to address Cotontchad’s key financial and operational needs. This would enable the launch o f the
bidding for Cotontchad in the second h a l f o f 2004 and the completion o f the process by mid2005.
45. Private-public partnerships. The private sector has a role to play to complement the public
administration in the delivery o f services. Private partnerships have begun in the health sector in
order t o leverage the state’s limited capacity and to perform under more adequate incentive
systems. The main constraints are the limited capacity o f the private sector and the weak
infrastructure.
(iv) Human capital and labor opportunities are key to making growth inclusive and
reducing the vulnerability o f the poor

46. Chad’s dramatically l o w socio-economic and human development indicators (see poverty
profile above) show h o w serious a constraint human capital i s for the poor t o be able to contribute
t o and benefit from economic growth. Broader access to education, health, and other basic
services will be needed t o build and maintain the human capital assets o f the poor, enabling them
to participate in income-eaming opportunities and reduce their vulnerability. In addition, the
transition to the o i l economy i s expected to change the labor market, with the share o f the private

- 15 -

sector likely t o grow substantially. Additional s k i l l s will be required in the public sector as well,
particularly in light o f existing capacity shortfalls. The systems o f higher education and
vocational training will need to increase s h l l s substantially, both in quantity and quality terms.

47. Core labor standards. Chad has ratified 7 o f the 8 International Labor Organization (EO)
conventions on the freedom o f association and collective bargaining, the elimination o f forced
and compulsory labor, the elimination o f discrimination in respect o f employment and occupation
and the abolition o f child labor. Workers can organize freely in trade unions, and both public and
private sector trade unions are active in wage negotiations, and in negotiations regarding worlung
conditions and labor conflicts. Trade unions are also represented in the PRSP Steering Committee
and constitute an important and active social partner. Child labor i s not a significant issue in the
fairly small formal economy. However, Chad i s an agricultural subsistence economy, where
children are usually expected to work alongside their parents and older siblings in agricultural
activities. T h e PRSP recognizes the potential problem and aims to mitigate the pernicious effects
o f informal mechanisms by discouraging child labor, initially at least in i t s worst forms.

- THEWORLD BANKGROUP’SSTRATEGY
48. T h e Bank Group’s Assistance Strategy aims to help C h a d use i t s oil resources for
poverty reduction by strengthening governance and creating greater and more inclusive
income-earning opportunities outside oil. The overarching objective o f this C A S i s to help
Chad make the best possible developmental use o f its new o i l revenues-as w e l l as public
resources more broadly-to
attain the MDGs. Toward this objective, the CAS has two pillars.
The f i r s t i s to strengthen governance, including public resource management and service delivery
arrangements, the rule o f law, and environmental and social safeguards for o i l exploitation. The
second i s to ensure inclusive, broad-based growth as the country embarks o n o i l production. That
requires a conducive macroeconomic framework, fewer constraints o n private economic activity
to encourage non-oil activities, and broader rural development as w e l l as special attention to
opportunities for and vulnerabilities o f the poor. The two pillars o f the C A S come directly from
the five strategic axes o f the PRSP, taking into account the B a n k Group’s diagnosis o f Chad’s
main development challenges and opportunities-and
o f where it can best assist the country
while complementing other development partners. The W o r l d B a n k Group’s explicit strategy i s
to be present, albeit with modest amounts, in the key priority sectors as defined in the PRML, so
as to have a handle o n the absorption capacity and the quality o f the spending in the priority
sectors.

49. The results-based framework o f this CAS details the main C A S outcomes, as they relate to
the PRSP objectives, and the main indicators to measure progress (Table 4).

Pillar 1 Strengthening governance, including public resource management and
service delivery arrangements, the rule of law, and environmental and social
safeguards for oil exploitation
50. Under this pillar, the W o r l d Bank Group will support Chad’s efforts t o improve governance,
as indicated under the first axis o f the PRSP. I t will help promote transparent and accountable
use o f public resources and o i l revenues to reduce poverty, and help strengthen the rule o f law.
Public resources,particularly oil revenues, will be managed and used transparently and
accountably

5 1. The public procurement system will become more transparent and efficient. The W o r l d
Bank Group will continue to support the Government in its public procurement reform program.
After the adoption o f the n e w Public Procurement Code, capacity-building activities will help
improve transparency, notably through additional IDA financing to extend and deepen activities
that are currently supported under the Management o f the Petroleum Economy Project (GEEP).
A computerized monitoring system will follow up on procurement contracts. Transaction time i s
expected to come down by 25 percent by 2006, and subsequent audit reports would be expected
to show a reduced incidence o f sole-sourcing and fewer irregularities.
52. Budget preparation, execution, and monitoring will improve, and priority ministries
will have improved their capacity to track expenditures. The W o r l d B a n k Group will assist
the Government in: (i)monitoring the budget process and designing corrective actions; (ii)
improving the absorptive capacity o f priority sectors and ensuring the rational and efficient use o f
new resources; and (iii)
building capacity for developing alternative o i l revenue scenarios to
improve macroeconomic programming and budget management.

53. Participatory public expenditure reviews will be conducted annually in the priority sectors to
give civil servants and representatives o f c i v i l society the opportunity to reflect o n budget

- 18 -

allocation issues. The conclusions o f these remews will be widely disseminated in order to help
ensure greater equity and efficiency in the budgeting process and to increase accountability in a
broad sense. The programs supported by adjustment operations will be focused o n the milestones
necessary to obtain budgetary and civil service capacity reform. Sector expenditure programs
will be prepared in close consultation with donors, and it i s expected that budget documents will
incorporate MTEFs for the priority sectors. I t i s also expected that a computerized management
system will b e in place and functioning, and that execution rates for budgets in the priority
ministries will increase.

54. Key oversight and control institutions will function well, and their independencewill be
respected. The World Bank Group will help ensure that the key oversight and control
institutions continue to function well and independently. It will continue to support the Collsge
de ContrGle et de Surveillance des Ressources PktroliBres (CCSRP) through training and focused
technical assistance. I t will also provide support to other institutions to establish appropriate
checks and balances: the Chambre des Comptes, the Parliament, and the General Inspectorate o f
the Ministry o f Finance. The CCSRP and the Chambre des Comptes are expected t o publish
regular and timely reports o f satisfactory quality.

55. Environment and social safeguards will be mainstreamed in oil development activities.
The capacity built in the Comite' Technique National de Suivi et de Contrdle (CTNSC), a public
agency mandated to follow preparation for and monitoring o f o i l exploitation, will directly benefit
the Ministry o f Environment and Water in charge o f CTNSC. The W o r l d B a n k Group will assist
in this transfer o f capacity through the Petroleum Sector Management Capacity-Building project.
I t will also strengthen the capacity o f the Ministry o f Environment and Water to ensure that it
adequately co-manages protected areas and enforces environmental regulations. As a result, it i s
expected that continued diligence will be exercised in implementing the Environment
Management Plan (EMP) under the Petroleum Development and Pipeline Proj ect-with
particular attention paid to the implementation o f the action plan prepared in response to the
report of the Inspection Panel, and approved by the Board in September 2002-and
that
satisfactory social and environmental safeguards will be integrated in any new o i l projects.
56. As part o f its strategy t o achieve the outcome o f improved public resource management, the
W o r l d Bank Group (with support from WBI in particular) will focus o n pursuing on-going efforts
to build Chadian capacity. Table 5 below summarizes the status o f these efforts, as well as the
main future activities contemplated in the next C A S period.

The rule of law will be strengthened, and security will have started to improve

57. The lack o f a reliable justice system and responsible defense and security forces i s
considered a characteristic o f poor governance in Chad and was flagged as a priority issue in
Chad’s PRSP. But justice and security are not included in the l i s t o f priority sectors in the
Petroleum Revenue Management Program, so they may suffer from inadequate funding. The
next step after holding the Etats Gdndraux de la Justice i s to prepare a strategy for judicial
reform, The Bank, with other donors, could envision supporting its implementation, through the
additional financing envisaged for capacity-building activities that are presently supported under
the Management o f the Petroleum Economy Project (GEEP). Bank dialogue will also keep track
of, and if appropriate support, measures to ensure that Chad gets the needed assistance o n security
issues. In particular, the Bank i s prepared to contribute to the financing o f the Programme
National de Ddmobilisation et de Rdinsertion that i s expected t o be finalized and launched by the
Govemment in 2004. 25,000 former combatants are expected to be re-integrated in c i v i l social
and economic activities. IDA will provide funding to support the re-integration o f about 5,000
former combatants. Finally, through the PROADEL, the Bank will support the elaboration o f the
additional legal and regulatory provisions that are necessary t o move the decentralization process
forward.

Pillar 2 - Ensuring inclusive, broad-basedgrowth as the country embarks on oil
production
58. W o r l d Bank Group interventions will a i m at creating economic opportunities in the non-oil
sectors by helping to increase cost-effective access to markets for producers in rural and urban
areas-and by helping to augment agricultural productivity. Bank Group interventions will also

- 20 -

a i m at reducing the vulnerability o f local populations by increasing their human capital and
increasing their chance t o seize economic opportunities in the non-oil sectors. T o do this, it will
promote the empowerment o f communities and vulnerable groups in local development decisionm a h n g as w e l l as the improvement o f health, education, and water service delivery.

Increase economic ouuortunities outside oil
Producers will be more able to get products to markets cost-effectively
59. The transport system and transport services will be more reliable and efficient. The
Bank will continue to support the Government's National Transport Program: (i)investment
lending for the National Road Network o f paved roads; (ii)
community-based rural development
projects such as the PROADEL, which include decentralized support t o local communities for the
improvement o f local and small-scale transport infrastructure; (iii)
capacity-building, through the
ongoing PAPRONAT, which includes a large training component and other institutional support
measures; (iv) actions to increase the absorptive capacity for o i l revenues in the transport
infrastructure sub-sector, including rural transport, also through the PAPRONAT; and (v)
(possibly beyond the C A S period) a new sector investment credit, to continue support for the
second phase o f the National Transport Program. As a result, it i s expected that, by the end o f the
C A S period, the size o f the paved road network will increase from some 550 km to 750 km and
that average transport tariffs for goods and passengers between N'dj amena and provincial capitals
will decrease by 10 percent.

60. The reliability and availability of electricity and energy will increase For electricity,
proposed actions for the upcoming C A S period include: (i)
design an electricity sector strategy,
optimizing the use o f domestic primary energy resources; (ii)
mobilize additional financing for
system modemization and conversion t o lower-cost power generation technology; (iii)ensure
Government noninterference in sector management and operation; and (iv) develop national
institutions to increase targets for expanding access in selected peri-urban and rural areas, through
private-public partnership and output-based financial support. For biomass, proposed actions
include: (i)reinforcing the institutions for biomass management; and (ii)extending the
community-based forestry management program for energy supply t o another 300 villages over
four years. I F C will also seek to work with Govemment to structure concessions for private
participation in other sectors, such as telecommunications. Finally, the privatization program and
the implementation o f regulatory reforms in the telecommunications, electricity, and other
relevant sectors will be finalized.
61. Private firms will have better access to financing. Since January 2002 various projects
have been under way in (i)access to finance; (ii)capacity building; and (iii)access to
information. Feasibility studies and training and information activities have been conducted for
most o f them. Training and information sessions and related investment activities will be the
focus o f the upcoming C A S period. An urban operation will concentrate o n improving the
business environment in cities and o n creating business and employment opportunities for private
construction operators. IFC will build upon current investments and technical assistance, which
have established SME lending facilities with commercial banks as w e l l as a n e w micro-finance
institution. Specific support will consist o f financing facilities, together with capacity-building
for financial institutions. Moreover, IFC will continue to build capacity in the private sector with
a series o f technical assistance and capacity-building initiatives.
62. Urban infrastructures will improve. In l i n e with the Govemment's urban program, W o r l d
Bank Group support would provide financing for urban infrastructure and capacity-building to
support economic growth and improve the quality o f life for urban residents, particularly the
poor. I t would provide water, sanitation and drainage, and economic infrastructure. I t also would
create employment opportunities for unskdled and semiskilled labor and promote SMEs in

-21 -

construction and urban services. Finally, it would improve capacity in central and local
governments t o plan and manage municipalities-and update sector policies and tools, such as
zoning, cadastre, and land management.

The productivity of 2,000 Producer Organizations in selected major crops and livestock
products will have begun increasing
63. The C A S incorporates the various dimensions o f agricultural and rural development as a
core priority. A comprehensive strategic framework for rural development has been put in place
by the Government o f Chad in the form o f the Plan d’Intewention pour le Diveloppement Rural
(PIDR), w h i c h has facilitated both inter-ministerial and donors coordination. In this context, the
support efforts to improve agricultural productivity, with particular
W o r l d Bank Group will: (i)
attention t o the cotton sector, notably through the Agricultural Services and Producer
Organizations Project (ASPOP); (ii)
seek to empower rural communities in taking decisions on
and managing basic rural infrastructure through the Local Development Program Support Project
(PROADEL); (iii)
develop the links to markets through the improvement o f the road network
(PAPRONAT), the financing o f rural roads (PROADEL), and the development o f market
infrastructures (Urban project); and (iv) support and monitor improvements in the efficiency o f
public expenditures in ministries in charge o f rural development, notably through PERs covering
these ministries, as well as through assistance for the preparation o f MTEFs. Finally, together
with UNDP, the W o r l d Bank Group will support the overall monitoring system for agncultural
and rural development.
64. Farmer organizations, agricultural extension and research issues. The proposed ASPOP
will support activities to create sustainable growth in agricultural production and provide support
to producer organizations and support the delivery o f agricultural services. K e y actions during
the upcoming C A S period include financing productivity-raising interventions and enhancing the
institutional and technical capacity o f producer organizations, govemment institutions, and
private operators. A major activity relevant to the entire rural sector i s monitoring a l l rural sector
activities for their impacts o n agriculture and poverty reduction.
65. Cotton reform. The Government puts strong emphasis o n addressing physical, technical,
and institutional issues in cotton. Specific areas to be addressed include: (i)
rehabilitating and
improving farm productivity through a more effective extension and
maintaining rural roads; (ii)
research system; and (iii)
supporting the institutional and organizational development o f cotton
producer organizations. Plans are underway for a priority rural road network in the cotton zone,
to be rehabilitated beginning in 2004 using o i l proceeds. An action plan to address farm
productivity and cotton producer organizations has been set out in the context o f the planned
Bank-financed ASPOP project.
66. Environment. The W o r l d Bank Group has supported the preparation o f the National
Environment Action Plan (NEAP), which i s awaiting validation by the Government. The W o r l d
Bank expects to support i t s implementation in several areas. In addition to the support provided
to build capacity for environment management in the petroleum sector (see paragraph 55), the
World Bank Group, through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) co-financing o f
PROADEL and ASPOP (that will be presented to the Board in FY04) will support: (i)
community-based integrated ecosystem management activities; (ii)
promotion o f environmentally
sustainable agricultural techniques; and (iii)
capacity-building at the central and decentralized
levels for natural resource management and environmental governance. The focus during the
CAS period will be o n strengthening local capacity for community-based integrated ecosystem
management and providing co-financing for micro-projects with a positive impact o n the global
environment. In addition, through the PROADEL, IDA will continue t o support activities to
improve environmentally sustainable management o f wood-fuel resources and improvement o f

-22 -

efficiency o f household energy production. Finally, the W o r l d Bank Group will support and
monitor the improvement in the efficiency o f public expenditures in ministries in charge o f rural
development, notably through PERs in the environment sector, and assistance for the preparation
o f MTEFs.

Exuand ouportunities and reduce vulnerabilitv
Communities and vulnerable groups, women in particular, will be empowered
67. The W o r l d Bank Group expects that 250 micro-projects benefiting communities in 10
departments will be implemented based o n their approved local development plans and will be
operated and maintained in a sustainable manner, and that the number o f women accessing microcredit will increase from 5,000 in 2003 t o 20,000 in 2006.
68. Community participation. The Bank will support the multi-donor Local Development
Program (PROADEL), envisioned as a major instrument for community-driven development. It
will support the Government in: (i)building a framework for decentralized funding and
management o f community development projects; (ii)strengthening the capacity and the
responsibility o f local communities; and (iii)implementing demand-driven community
subprojects. T h e focus during the C A S period will be o n empowering communities and
improving access to basic services, notably in the o i l production area, and o n supporting the
Government in the implementation o f decentralization.

69. In the fight against HIV/AIDS, IDA credits will continue to finance: (i)
community-based
interventions; (ii)
micro-credits to assist women in gaining their economic independence; (iii)
prevention activities directed at the general population; (iv) a social marketing program for
condoms at the national level; and (v) education to encourage pregnant women to be tested and to
avoid r i s k y behavior. Also the proposed ASPOP will support women empowerment, in particular
through access to micro-grants.
70. Population. The Bank plans to: (i)
continue to promote and implement the National
Population Policy; (ii)continue to finance the social marketing o f oral dehydration salts and
impregnated bed nets; and (iii)
support the collection and dissemination o f demographic data as
well as the education o f opinion leaders.

Delivery of basic services (health, education and water) will have improved
71. I n six regions, health services will be accessible f o r the poor. Increasing the health
sector’s absorptive capacity and ensuring adequate allocations o f expenditures will be a main
orientation o f the Bank’s policy dialogue. For health-related interventions, this effort t o be
undertaken, in collaboration with other concerned sector partners, with particular focus o n (i)
the
development o f human resources; (ii)
assisting the Ministry o f Public Health in six regions, in
strengthening basic health services and putting in place systems for monitoring o f health
activities, epidemics, and health statistics in general; (iii)
continuing to develop and implement
reforms through the on-going Health Sector Support Project; (iv) continuing t o provide financing
for the H I V / A I D S prevention and control program; (v) assisting the Ministry o f Public Health in
meeting the technical requirements for the use o f antiretroviral drugs; and (vi) continuing support
for human resource development in the health sector.
72. Access to higher quality education will improve. The Education Strategy, presented in
January 2000, recognizes the community schools and teachers as a key instrument for improving
access and quality o f primary education. Through the PARSET, the W o r l d B a n k Group will
continue to support the implementation o f t h s strategy and expects that the student-teacher ratio
will have decreased from 74 in 2001 down to 65 in 2006 and that the percentage o f community

-23

-

teachers having received basic training and that are certified increases from 15 percent in 2002/3
to 50 percent in 200617.
73. Beyond its current focus on primary education, W o r l d Bank Group assistance will gradually
shift towards a more balanced approach, supporting the whole sector and malung use o f nonlending instruments and services to focus o n building capacity and increasing the supply o f highly
qualified people in the labor force. Based o n these principles, Bank assistance will help: (i)
improve overall quality and access to education, especially for girls; (ii)
enhance the quality and
selective expansion o f education services beyond the primary level; and (iii)
build the educational
capacity to plan and execute educational programs at the national and regional level. Under postprimary education the focus will be o n non-lending activities and technical training. Attention
will also be paid to capacity-building within the education sector, focusing o n improving the
sector’s readiness to absorb a significant amount o f additional resources from the PARSET credit
beginning late in 2003, o i l revenues beginning in early 2004, and possibly additional donor
contributions through the Fast Track Initiative in 2004-2005.

74. The W o r l d Bank Group will also support preparation o f a strategy to strengthen the higher
education system and develop vocational training. This strategy will seek synergies with
neighboring countries in the region that have already developed excellent curricula in specific
areas, while identifying areas o f expertise in which Chad may develop a comparative advantage.
T h i s strategy will also seek to support Chad’s labor force in its transition to a petroleum
economy, while emphasizing the need to diversify i t s growth.
75. Production of drinkable water increases from 25,000 to 35,000 cubic meterdday and
the consumption o f water per connected household increases by 10 percent by 2006.
Towards this, the W o r l d Bank Group will help ensure that Government institutions are better able
to plan, program, and implement sustainable water and sanitation services. Priority programs in
this CAS include strengthening the Water Code, monitoring the planned construction o f about
7,500 n e w water points, and setting up o f improved framework for the management and
maintenance o f existing facilities. The policy dialogue o n water resource management will center
on: (i)
strengthening the facilitation o f the Directorate’s monitoring capacity; (ii)
consolidating
human resources capacities in the Directorate o f Water; (iii)
expanding the Water Code from
urban potable water to include a l l water uses; and (iv) malung optimal use o f intemational surface
and groundwater resources, through participation in the Niger Basin Authority and the Lake Chad
Basin Commission. A GEF project, which i s also receiving parallel GEF support through UNDP,
was approved in January 2003 to support the Commission’s capacity to coordinate water use
policies among the five govemments.
76. For rural water and sanitation, the Bank will continue to strengthen the policy dialogue with
Government and the donor community and provide technical assistance t o implement a rural
water and sanitation sector-wide approach. National resources will be dedicated mainly to
strengthening the central and regional capacity o f the Directorate o f Water to program, execute,
and monitor activities and improve the sustainability o f investments.
77. For urban water supply and sanitation, the Critical Electricity and Water Supply Project
(FY03) i s currently focusing o n rehabilitating existing installations to ensure continuing service
for the population already served. A successor operation, to be included in the next CAS period,
would be prepared to support the extension and construction works t o respond to growing
demand for water services in coming years.
78. M o s t o f the country’s m a i n cities have serious sanitation problems. Planned IDA support in
the urban sector will focus on: (i)
reviewing the state o f sanitation facilities management; (ii)
improving efficiency and effectiveness in developing sanitation and ensuring that adequate funds
are available to contract out services to the private sector; and (iii)developing an enabling

- 24 -

environment and an institutional capacity to plan, program, and implement sustainable sanitation
services for the cities.

(i)Regional dimension o f the strategy
79. The W o r l d Bank’s Board discussed a Regional Integration Assistance Strategy ( € U S ) for
the C E M A C countries o n February 6, 2003. As discussed earlier, Chad can benefit from
how
fostering links with neighboring C E M A C countries. The C A S recognizes in particular: (i)
C E M A C arrangements can help sustain macroeconomic stability in times o f rapid o i l
development; and (ii)
the importance o f the transit corridor to Douala. Efforts will be pursued
during the C A S period to support reforms and activities that complement the regional program,
particularly the customs union and the transport facilitation. Finally, a Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study (DTIS), scheduled in FY05, will be conducted in Chad in the context o f the
Bank-wide Integrated Framework initiative, in order to identify major obstacles to the integration
o f Chad into the global economy.
80. Regional payments system. The central bank, BEAC, with the financial assistance o f the
first regional IDA credit in the central Africa region, has launched a major reform o f the
payments system. This project will introduce real time settlement o f large and/or urgent
transactions, an electronic clearing system for mass payments and a modemized card system.
Delays in payment clearing and settlement will be significantly reduced to a maximum o f three
days for bank-to-bank transactions and seven days for client-to-client transactions. Today it i s
not unusual for a check to take five to six weeks to clear or even longer, resulting in a strong
negative impact o n trade and economic activity in general. As a by-product, a prepaid card
system will be developed for electricity and water consumption, thereby contributing t o increased
access to these services for more consumers. The W o r l d Bank will ensure active implementation
support for this project, which serves’as a key vehicle under the R I A S for the C E M A C Region.

(ii)World Bank Group country program and vehicles for assistance
81. New lending will support key aspects o f the governance agenda and non-oil growth
opportunities (notably through rural development), moving to programmatic support by
the end o f the CAS period. Base-case IDA lending planned for FY04-06 amounts to SDR 92
million (about US$128 million; see Table 6). Some SDR 5 million, the remaining “headroom”
under the current FY04-06 IDA allocation o f SDR 97 million, will be held in reserve in the event
o f additional funding needs under one or more operations. Presented alongside this C A S i s an
Agricultural Services and Producer Organizations Project (ASPOP) to provide much-needed
support to crop producer organizations. Also in FY04, a multi-donor Local Development
Program (PROADEL) will build the mechanisms to channel public resources to rural
communities, a planned Institutional Reform Support Credit will complete support to the threeyear reform program already supported by S A C I V and V, t o move forward the govemance
agenda and additional financing will extend and deepen activities that are currently supported
under the Management o f the Petroleum Economy Project (GEEP).
82. In FY05, an urban project will support the provision o f basic infrastructure to poor
neighborhoods in N’djamena and some secondary cities. And a demobilization and reintegration
project for ex-combatants will support Government efforts to improve the rule o f law. In F Y 0 6 a
PRSC would be put in place, the preparation o f which would be subject t o attaining specific
results-to be specified and discussed with the Government in the course o f F Y 0 4 policy
dialogue, and to be assessed in the context o f PERs, CEM/DPR and C F A A preparation-in
public expenditure management and in the policy and medium-term expenditure frameworks for

- 25 -

key sectors. In the event that conditions are deemed not sufficiently ready for a PRSC, the
“fallback” w o u l d consist of additional investment lending for infrastructure (likely through one or
more new operations). I F C will look for opportunities to expand and deepen i t s S M E and microcredit programs, strengthening the technical and financial capacity o f small and medium
entrepreneurs. In parallel, IFC’s S M E and micro-credit programs will continue to strengthen the
technical and financial capacity o f small and medium entrepreneurs, and expand firms’ access to
finance via private financial institutions. I F C will also seek t o finance key investments directly,
including smaller investments beyond the capacity o f existing financial institutions. I F C will also
seek t o provide advisory services to the Government where appropriate t o complement IDA
support for private infrastructure, and to work with Government t o structure concessions for
private participation in other sectors, such as telecommunications. Conceming MIGA, o f which
Chad i s a member, there have been a number o f preliminary enquiries o n potential guarantees (all
relating t o infrastructure), but none have yet come to fruition. Loolung forward, MIGA expects
to continue to seek promising opportunities.
83. IDA grants. Chad i s eligible for IDA grant financing under the “poorest countries” criterion
o f the IDA-13. In FY04, Chad was allocated US$17 m i l l i o n in grants which will be fully applied
to the Chad Local Development Program Support Project (PROADEL), to finance activities that
are expected to have a strong poverty reduction impact, notably the rural communities
subprojects. I t i s expected that Chad will also receive a grant allocation in FY05. It i s proposed
that the totality o f the FY05 grant allocation be applied to the urban project scheduled for FY05
because o f i t s expected impact o n urban poverty. The projects’ financial and monitoring and
evaluation systems are designed so as to account explicitly for the use o f the grant proceeds and,
to the extent feasible, to measure the impacts that are attributable to the grant financing.
84. Analytical and advisory activities ( A M ) will focus on the fiduciary aspects o f effective
public financial management and take stock of the overall policy framework and reform
program as the country settles into the oil era. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) will be prepared in FY04, and public expenditure reviews (PERs) will continue to be
prepared annually. The on-going expenditure tracking surveys and beneficiary assessments will
be completed, and capacity built for their regular repetition. A formal Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR) i s planned for FY06, allowing some time to elapse to assess
experience under the n e w procurement code, n o w being finalized. In the interim, public
procurement performance will be closely monitored o n a continuous basis as part o f the overall
adjustment credit-supported reform program and capacity-building in relation to the o i l revenue
management program. A s Chad enters the period o f steady o i l production, an integrative
CEM/DPR assessment, and a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) are scheduled for FY05,
and an investment climate assessment for FY06. The CFAA, the PERs, and the CEM/DPR will
help determine whether Chad i s ready for a PRSC. Finally, as part o f the supervision o f
PARSET, the Bank will help prepare a Secondary and Higher Education Reform Strategy.
85. W o r k o n the poverty and social impact o f cotton sector reforms will be continued, given the
crop’s critical role in sustaining numerous low-income rural households. A poverty assessment in
FY05, with a focus o n gender, will help measure progress toward the PRSP objectives. An
analysis o f the financial sector i s also programmed for FY05, t o deepen understanding o f
financing constraints o n private business. Finally, a key part o f the AAA w o r k will relate to subregional integration efforts under C E M A C .

86. IDA portfolio management and performance. The current portfolio will equally
contribute to the attainment o f C A S objectives, as indicated in Annex 1. Seven o f the eight
operations in the current portfolio are rated satisfactory. During this C A S period, particular
emphasis will be put on project supervision t o improve the quality o f portfolio, and to ensure
timely completion o f activities. Recommendations o f the January 2003 CPPR will continue to be
monitored by the country office, with a particular emphasis o n timely availability o f counterpart
funds and more expeditious procurement. Particular attention will go to projects in M&E systems
t o make sure they are fully operational and compatible with the overall framework o f PRSP
monitoring.
87. WBI. WBI will undertake a training needs assessment and an assessment o f existing
leaming institutions that can serve as focal points for knowledge-sharing and capacity-building in
Chad. In FY04, WBI will develop a customized capacity-building program focusing o n revenue
management and an associated monitoring and evaluation system for Chadian institutions and
professionals. A s an outcome o f the assessment, WBI will develop additional leaming
partnerships, including in the education sector.
88. I F C portfolio management and performance. IFC’s portfolio i s dominated by the o i l
pipeline project, whose total financing i s US$lOO m i l l i o n in an A loan and US$lOO m i l l i o n in a B
loan syndication. (However, for recording purposes only 14 percent o f project funding was
allocated to Chad, reflecting the portion o f pipeline length that i s in the country.) IFC’s two
additional investments, made during FY03 under the SME initiative, are a US$1.1 m i l l i o n

- 27 -

guarantee facility with a commercial bank and a US$174,000 equity investment in a microfinance
bank. Chad joined I F C only in 1998 and only one other investment, a small dairy operation, was
ever approved but never proceeded. The portfolio i s only recently disbursed and there are n o
meaningful performance measures. These investments have been complemented by a significant
technical assistance effort. I F C placed a full-time coordinator in N’djamena in 2002, and the
program has been implemented with the assistance o f the A h c a Project Development Facility.
89. Selectivity considerations. The W o r l d Bank Group’s relatively broad involvement in Chad
i s a consequence o f the prominent role it i s committed to playing in the petroleum era: being a
partner in managing the use o f o i l revenues, the World Bank Group’s explicit strategy i s to be
present, albeit with modest amounts, in the key priority sectors as defined in the PRML, so as to
have a handle o n the absorption capacity and the quality o f the spending in the priority sectors.

(iii)Lending scenarios and triggers
90. Remaining in the base case scenario would depend o n satisfactory implementation o f key
PRSP reforms, effective absorption o f o i l revenues, in compliance with the Petroleum Revenue
Management Program, and portfolio performance. In particular, serious breaches o f the
provisions o f the Petroleum Revenue Management Program would trigger a low-case lending
scenario. Diversions o f o i l revenues to ineligible uses and interference with independent
oversight o n the use o f o i l revenues would put any new IDA lending o n h o l d until satisfactory
corrective measures have been taken. Depending o n the precise timing o f such an eventuality,
lending volumes for FY04-06 IDA would range somewhere between US$43 m i l l i o n (the amount
o f the two operations, namely the ASPOP and the P R O A D E L slated for presention alongside or
in close proximity to this CAS) and the base-case lending scenario o f US$128 million. A
deterioration in IDA portfolio performance could also trigger an interruption in lending. While
I F C investments and advisory activity will not be explicitly tied to the IDA lending triggers, the
level o f I F C activity can be expected t o follow them closely.
91. Early and full implementation o f predefined measures strengthening public financial
management would trigger a high case lending scenario o f some 30 percent over the US$128
m i l l i o n base case (see Table 7). Specifically, high-case lending would be conditioned o n meeting
at least 10 o f the 15 Expenditure Accountability benchmarks in the HIPC framework (see Annex
5). This compares with the current situation where Chad meets only 6 o f the benchmarks. The
increased lending would be delivered in the form o f an increase in the PRSC a n d o r additional
financing for ongoing IDA-supported investments in electricity or transport. The allocation
would be made in consultation with Chadian authorities, based on an analysis o f absorptive
capacity and the expected poverty reduction impact.

(iv) Partners and participation
92. With o i l revenues increasing the national budget, donor contributions will diminish in
relative terms. The community o f donors needs to convey consistent messages to maintain
appropriate leverage in order to encourage completion o f the reform agenda and ensure sound use
o f o i l revenues. Donor interventions will change as o i l revenues finance priority sectors. But
financing gaps may still appear (as early as 2004) in other areas that cannot benefit from o i l
revenues, such as fiduciary controls, or justice.
93. There are many synergies between Bank Group assistance and other donors’ interventions
(see the results-based framework in Annex 1 and the matrix o n the alignment o f donors
interventions t o Chad’s PRSP in Annex 4). Examples include collaboration with the IMF to
support the Petroleum Revenue Management Program and active coordination among several key
donors to monitor the H I P C initiative and PRSP implementation. There i s also active multidonor coordination in rural development, both for the Local Development Program Support
Project and the Agricultural Services and Producer Organizations Project. The same i s true for
education
94. National consultations o n the CAS were held in N’djamena over the period September 8-19,
2003. The consultations involved in-depth discussion o n the diagnosis and content o f the draft
CAS with a broad range o f senior Govemment officials, c i v i l society and private sector
representatives, and the donor community. Overall, participants in the consultations considered
the two pillars o f the C A S to be well-aligned with the country’s development priorities as
expressed in the PRSP and with the Bank’s comparative advantage. In particular, they considered
that the Bank was a critical partner in ensuring that o i l revenues are used for poverty reduction,
and that environmental and social safeguards associated with o i l production and transportation
continue are mainstreamed.

(v) Lessons from the previous CAS
95. W o r l d Bank Group interventions during the last C A S period (FY00-03) were organized
mainly around the Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project. There has been n o formal
assessment in the form o f a C A S completion report, nor has OED recently prepared a country
assistance evaluation. But comments from the International Advisory Group for the Petroleum

-29-

Development and Pipeline Project, NGOs, the Chadian Govemment, and Bank staff point to the
following lessons.
0

Capacity-building requires time and ownership, and should start as early as possible. As a
result, this CAS continues to deepen the capacity-building efforts by ensuring in
particular that most AAA and new lending activities will have a focus o n nurturing the
capabilities o f Chadian institutions and professionals, and through the development o f a
customized WBI program. I F C efforts to build capacity in the private sector to enable
local f i r m s to compete effectively for construction and related sub-contracts was largely
unsuccessful, as a short-term effort was not sufficient to overcome the inherent obstacles.

0

Partnerships with private sector, and more generally communities and c i v i l society, are
powerful drivers o f success. T h i s C A S seeks explicitly to broaden the range o f partners
for a more inclusive development path.

0

An appropriate mix o f instruments i s necessary to balance incentive and leverage. Just as
the IBRD loans for the Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project alone would not
have guaranteed that the Revenue Management Program was put in place in a timely
manner, the series o f adjustment credits alone would not have been sufficient t o support
significant progress in governance. The CAS i s therefore proposing a mix o f adjustment
(and later, programmatic), investment, and technical assistance instruments to
complement government revenues and donor financing.

0

In the private sector, a comprehensive package o f improving access t o finance, building
capacity and improving access to and use o f information, as w e l l as improving the
enabling environment i s essential to realizing increased private investment; partial
interventions will not bring results.

0

Donor consistency and coordination in the policy dialogue are key to achieving results in
the long term. In the case o f electricity for example, the Govemment’s confidence in the
W o r l d Bank has suffered as a result o f inconsistencies in the messages delivered. As a
result, the Government decided t o proceed o n i t s own for important investment decisions,
with very disappointing results. Restoring confidence i s talung time, and donor
coordination i s critical to ensure consistency o f messages.

(vi) The IDA and IFC portfolios
96. The CPPR in January 2003 identified the lack o f counterpart funds as a major factor in
slowing project implementation. T h i s i s expected to become less o f an issue with the advent o f o i l
revenues, and the projects under preparation provide for progressively higher contributions from
Government.

97. The CPPR also pointed to the lack o f human capacities as a major constraint in project
implementation. In many instances the private labor market could not provide the appropriate
s k i l l s for project implementation, and c i v i l servants are very reluctant to resign from the
administration to apply for positions that are only temporary. Very selective exceptions t o the rule
that civil servants o n secondment cannot b e financed by IDA has allowed for some significant
improvements in projects implementation, while helping to avoid a “brain drain” from the
administration.
98. In the SME initiative, I F C has expended more resources in technical assistance than i t has
provided in financing. T h i s reflects the initial needs for improving capacity before new
investments can be made sustainable. The need for capacity-building and technical assistance to
complement financing will continue for the immediate future under the n e w CAS.

RESULTS-BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION

99. Monitoring CAS implementation. T h e Results Framework in Table 4 establishes the
results chain for the Bank’s program and augments the traditional monitoring o f progress on
inputs and deliveries with a focus o n outputs and outcomes, linked to longer term country
outcomes. Against each o f the CAS outcomes, the CAS has identified a set o f outcome and
output indicators to measure progress (column 2 in Table 4). In most cases, these indicators are
quantified with expected target ranges and in some cases more qualitative information needs to be
derived. Where there are current gaps in information (such as lack o f quantitative indicators,
targets and baselines) the Bank will work with the Borrower in identifying specific measurements
o f outcomes during the first year o f C A S implementation.
100.The Bank’s CPPR will be aligned with the results framework, assessing progress in
achieving the main C A S outcomes and outputs, what risks and problems are being experienced
which might hinder achievement o f the outcomes, and what systemic issues m a y need to be
addressed impacting the portfolio. At mid term, the C A S progress report will conduct a more indepth examination o f the C A S outcomes and whether these remain relevant t o the longer term
objectives given the country conditions. Finally, a completion report will be completed to feed
into the next C A S cycle.
10 1. Data Link to the PRSP. Table 4 shows the links to the main areas o f the PRSP and the
results framework. Where possible, the C A S will use data collection mechanisms already in use
in monitoring the PRSP (discussed in chapter 6 o f the PRSP, and section 6.2 in particular) mainly
for higher-order outcomes. Lack o f data and data deficiency are issues that will be partially
addressed as the results o f the ECOSIT I1will be available by the end o f FY04. For other more
detailed or aggregated indicators, the PRSP does not provide all o f the information that will be
necessary. In many instances this information will be provided either through administrative data
in the line ministries, or within the management o f projects; for instance, the PARSET will
provide information o n improvements in access to and quality o f education Bank Group
involvement, or the PAPRONAT will provide information o n improvement in the reliability and
efficiency o f the transport system, notably between N’djamena and provincial capitals.

102. Managing for results. While specific operations are planned against the outcomes defined
in the results matrix, the C A S will remain dynamic to changes in-country and any signals arising
from the monitoring process that point to the need to redirect resources. Should Chad move to
the high- or low-case scenario, the Bank Group will adjust the monitoring frameworks to take
into account the potential impact o f moving from the base case. The Bank Group will also
support the Government in improving i t s management for results. Pillar 1 directly supports
improving capacity in Government for expenditure management and trackmg.

VI11 MANAGING
RISKS
103. Risks to CAS implementation, and to Chad’s development prospects, include those of
political turbulence and deteriorations in the rule of law more broadly. Geopolitical risks
include those o f spillovers from possible turbulence in i t s neighbors, such as the CAR, and
outside support for rebellious factions within Chad. Heightened geopolitical risks and attempts to
address them may divert resources and the attention o f policymakers f r o m poverty reduction.
There i s also a risk o f significant deterioration in l a w and order. As o i l revenues begin t o accrue
and the stakes rise, power may be contested by violent means. And road blocking, violent crime,

-31

-

and the theft o f public resources may increase. The Bank Group cannot directly influence
political risks, but it can support the strengthening o f institutional arrangements for good
governance.

104. Other risks include poor management of oil revenues, faltering reform efforts, and
external shocks. The Government may demonstrate less-than-full commitment to the petroleum
revenue management program-and
to reforms more generally-mce o i l revenues come in.
Continuing a close dialogue, as well as spotlighting the low-case lending triggers, can mitigate
this. If expectations o f “the promise o f oil” (tangible results such as in the form o f immediate
infrastructure improvements in the oil-producing region) go unfulfilled, there could be social
unrest, possibly compounded if the cotton crisis persists. I f capacity-enhancing measures take too
long, o i l revenues could accumulate in savings accounts rather than be spent o n the people. But
technical support from the Bank and other donors will help identify and implement expenditure
items that can yield quick, visible benefits for the populace-augmented by an outreach program
that helps set realistic expectations. Finally, o i l prices could decline. T h i s risk will be
substantially mitigated by the stabilization mechanism that Chad has established (as well as by
close consultation with the Bank and the Fund).

105. Chad’s relatively low institutional and human capacity creates a significant risk to the
implementation o f the W o r l d Bank Group program, and o f the Government’s PRSP more
broadly. To mitigate this risk, the World Bank Group i s proposing a comprehensive and
ambitious capacity-building effort to address cross-cutting priorities as summarized in Table 5
above. Also, each o f the lending and non-lending activities in the World-Bank program
integrates capacity-building as one o f i t s central component.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

106. T h i s i s a critical phase in Chad’s recent history. The “oil experiment”-which will have
much broader ramifications for natural-resource-based development in the developing
countries-is
poised for success, provided the Chadian authorities, backed by the donor
community, stay the course. Together with support from other external partners, the assistance
package proposed in this CAS will help improve the chances o f successfully using petroleum
revenues to accelerate Chad’s attainment o f the MDGs.

ANNEXI1- ELEMENTS
OF A ROADMAP FOR PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT IN CHAD

I.

Introduction and Summary

One o f the biggest challenges in Chad i s to ensure inclusive, broad-based growth as the country
embarks o n o i l production, and for that purpose to create a sustainable framework for the absorption o f
the forthcoming o i l revenues in the diversification o f the country’s economic base. M o r e specifically,
Chad faces two sets o f constraints: immediate critical infrastructure needs, most prominently in the
road and electricity sectors, which, if unfulfilled, put at risk the survival o f the fragile existing private
sector and therefore call for urgent short-term investments and actions; and broader structural barriers
that require a more comprehensive strategy and longer-term vision.

As indicated in the JSA, the Government’s PRSP rightly identifies k e y structural constraints o n private
sector development in Chad, such as the unfavorable business environment, weak financial
intermediation, l o w productivity in agriculture, scarce slulled human resources, and high transport
costs. I t also correctly links the underdeveloped state o f the banlung system, and o f the financial
system more generally, to the l o w level o f saving in the country. Nevertheless, the proposals o f the
PRSP remain tentative. The first PRSP progress report and the update o f the PRSP offer good vehicles
to deepen these proposals.
Ina context where the country lacks a longer-term vision for private sector development, this CAS will
primarily focus o n addressing the short-term infrastructure constraints in the transport and electricity
sector so as to enable producers to access markets more cost-effectively. In addition, IFC will
continue to build capacity in the private sector with technical assistance and capacity-building
initiatives. In parallel, the W o r l d Bank Group will undertake an investment climate assessment (to be
delivered in FY06) in order to support the elaboration by the Government o f a private sector
development strategy.

In this context, this Annex aims to summarize the current knowledge o f the characteristics o f the
business environment in Chad, as well as initial broad strategic orientations that could serve as a basis
to prepare a roadmap for private sector development, together with the Government.

11.

Analysis of Selected Private Sector Development Issues

A.

Characteristics of the Business Environment

The business environment in Chad i s limited in scope and capacity, and does not enable private sector
development. Attracting private investment into such an environment i s challenging.
Chad’s economic development i s severely constrained by the lack o f access to relevant infrastructure
and high factor costs where infrastructure services do exist. The major part o f the country remains
land-locked. Internal transport o f goods by road or air i s difficult, sometimes, impossible. Chad has
only 550 km o f paved roads in a country more than twice the size o f France. The average cost o f
international freight i s much above standards, when compared to the situation prevailing in other
similar land-locked countries. For instance, the transport cost o f a 20-foot container i s 40 percent
higher between N’djamena, Chad and the Douala harbor, Cameroon, than between Bamako, M a l i and
Lome port, Togo, the two distances being roughly equal.
In the same vein, electricity costs are too high. For instance, the average cost o f electricity i s 2.5 times
higher than in Cote d’Ivoire. Moreover, electricity supply remains erratic and regular power shortages
severely impede industrial activities, the value-added in which relies extensively o n electricity.

Concerning telecommunications, there were only 1.3 lines per 1,000 people in 2000 (compared with an
average o f 5 lines per 1,000 inhabitants in Africa). With a population o f about 8 million, Chad has
only 12,000 fixed lines and 36,000 (26,000 active) mobile lines w h i c h are mostly concentrated in

-

37

-

N’djamena. Service levels are l o w and tariffs very high. There are n o public phones and telecenters
have just begun t o address this gap. Intemet access i s extremely underdeveloped, with less than a
thousand subscribers nationwide.

The regulatory framework i s not yet contributing to the creation o f a more conducive business
environment. F o r example, company tax i s o n average 40 percent and foreign goods carry a 60 percent
customs tax. Company registration procedures remain cumbersome and access to public services for
business development needs to be better developed. Similarly, the delivery o f public services also
needs to be strengthened.
Chad i s a member o f the OHADA (Organization for the Harmonization o f Business L a w in Africa)
which has designed and put into effect a well-acknowledged common legal framework. But in Chad,
many national rules and regulations have yet to be properly aligned with the OHADA laws, to say
nothing o f the serious vacuum in terms o f fair trade dispute settlement systems. T h i s discourages risktaking for many potential national and foreign investors.
The country has adopted the C E M A C (Economic and Monetary U n i o n o f Central A h c a ) common
external tariff. The internal tax system, as well as some elements o f the investment code, i s generally
in line with those prevailing in other C E M A C countries. But it should be noted that the new
Investment Charter inherited from U D E A C (Customs U n i o n o f Central Africa), the union from which
C E M A C originated, has not been adopted.

T h e banking sector remains underdeveloped and unable to adequately respond t o private sector
medium and long-term financing needs (in 2002, i t s total loan assets amount to only about US$135
million).
B.

General Characteristics of the Private Sector

The formal private sector in Chad i s limited and not very dynamic. I t consists predominantly o f
unorganized artisan and informal activities and there are only 5,500 registered enterprises, involved
mostly in import-export activities and 90 percent o f which have sales o f less than $50,000 per year. In
addition, management, entrepreneurial and technical skills, as well as basic education, are lacking.

In effect, most private sector actors first served as managers o f state-owned enterprises. The
dismantling o f marketing boards, which was supported under the I D A - f i n d e d structural adjustment
programs, has contributed to freeing potential entrepreneurs from the public sector. However, because
of the persistent lack o f economic opportunities, most o f these new entrepreneurs have been absorbed
in light commodities brokerage activities with limited value-added schemes and/or in the staffing o f
local offices o f multinational firms, many o f them n o t being involved at all in the creation o f local
value-added.
A s a result, there i s very limited presence o f private sector entrepreneurs in manufacturing and
industry in general. M o s t Chadian private sector entrepreneurs do not possess any enterprise
development culture. M o s t o f them have not been significantly exposed to exacting market
requirements in order to acquire the culture o f product and market development. Moreover, economic
opportunities remain very rare from a private sector perspective. T h i s situation i s largely due to the
absence o f relevant minimum infrastructure platforms. Also, the fact that sector analysis, planning and
policies have disappeared from public management has heavily contributed to increased uncertainty in
transforming potential economic opportunities into investment projects and ventures. In this regard, it
i s significant to note the total absence o f private sector operators in the area o f processing and export
o f fish and fish products, which the country possesses.
The lack o f structure, capacity and entrepreneurship in the Chadian private sector makes i t difficult t o
attract foreign partners and investors (though IFC’s US$200 m i l l i o n investment in the Petroleum
Development and Pipeline Project should help in increasing investor appetite for the country). I t also
means that most Chadian entrepreneurs have n o t yet been able to take full advantage o f the economic
opportunities induced by the Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project.

-

38

-

The country does not have an explicit S M E development strategy and relevant enterprise development
support services are almost inexistent in the field o f non-financial services. Nevertheless, the Support
and Entrepreneurship Program (STEP), financed by IFC, i s supporting training for microentrepreneurs in N’djamena. In addition, work o f NGOs and projects like F A C I L (financed by IDA in
the framework o f the Petroleum Sector Management Capacity-Building Project) i s contributing to
S M E development. The F A C I L project addresses community development needs in the o i l region
through training, provision o f micro-finance and small infrastructures.

C.

Alternate Sources of Growth

The identification of altemate sources o f growth i s a critical step towards reducing the country’s
prospective heavy dependence o n the o i l sector in the years ahead.
Chad possesses a considerable volume o f natural resources which are not exploited in an optimal way
with regard to market opportunities/expectations and technology availability at reasonable cost.
Among the resources of agncultural origin the following can be noted: gum Arabic, groundnuts, karite,
cotton fiber, cotton oil, beeswax and sesame. Cattle breeding i s to be considered in the perspective o f
processing meat and leather products, for which Nigeria (among others) provides a potentially large
market.
Aside from oil, other mineral resources exist in quantities significant enough to f o r m part o f the base
o f sustainable manufacturing activities. Among them, one could cite natrona and limestone. In
addition t o that, Lake Chad hosts considerable fish reserves for which there i s high demand from
exacting but solvent foreign markets even with minimal processing, conditioning and packaging, let
alone the unsatisfied local and regional demand for less elaborate products. In effect, aside from the
lake, Chad possesses abundant water resources which host fish o f quality and quantity, for which there
i s high demand.

But Lake Chad also hosts a h i g h concentration o f the blue spiriluna algae which in developed countries
like the USA, and n o w in some developing countries like Senegal, i s intensively farm-grown because
o f i t s recognized virtues in the struggle against cancer and immune system deficiencies, let alone the
fact that this algae i s a considerable source o f protein for malnutrition alleviation.
Most o f these resources could be exploited in a structured manner in order to develop integrated “byactivities” in terms o f cluster and value chain developments. T h i s approach i s crucial in terms o f
production and value-addition diversification strategy, and could also help enhance the absorption
capacity o f o i l revenues and other financial resources.
Some o f these resources are concentrated in the Lake Chad area (fish, natrona, limestone, spiriluna
algae). In addition, the high concentration o f polders in the area o f the lake gives the opportunity to
develop “bio” agriculture zones. This concentration o f comparative advantages qualifies the Lake
Chad economic sub-space for experiencing an integrated private sector-led growth strategy and related
programs.

D.

Private Sector Development Challenges and Perspectives

The design and implementation o f an “interface strategy for market opportunity development” should
help address the variety o f structural constraints such as the inexistent infrastructure base: n o roads, n o
energy access, no water and sanitation and above all, n o spatial approach t o infrastructure layout in
order to support the consolidation o f economic opportunities and anticipation by the private sector.
Solutions to these major problems could be generated by a thorough policy dialogue between
Government, private sector and the donor community, notably the W o r l d Bank. There i s a need to help
build the process and content o f policy dialogue, starting with building the capacity o f private sector to
change i t s role from that o f pure lobbying to a more policy advocacy and solution-provider
perspective. Chances o f success could be increased by re-orientating and securing Govemment

- 39 -

initiatives to support the private sector from a “less state but better state” perspective. In addition,
continuation and consolidation o f activities already launched by IFC will help solve some private
sector challenges.
It may be desirable for the World Bank Group to build on the activities already in place and
concentrate i t s efforts o n a few areas for increased impact. T h i s includes continued effort in the
Petroleum Area. Another unique opportunity lies in the Lake Chad region o f the country. In the
present situation, one possible approach may be to develop and implement a private sector-led growth
pilot project in the Lake Chad area supported by the “inte$ace approach to market-led opportunity
development ’’. The strategy could take up six major activities, namely:
i. b i o agriculture development in the Lake Chad polders;
ii. fishery development around the Lake Chad;
iii.on-site fish processing for export (and for the domestic and regional markets) in selected
landing grounds around the Lake Chad;
iv. limestone exploitation and processing;
v. natrona exploitation and processing for export;
vi. spiriluna algae harvesting/fanning and processing for export.

Each o f these activities could be an entry point for the build-up and consolidation o f a “growth
center”. In addition to that, all have a potential to develop “value chains clusters” o f increasing
spectrum by pushing the frontiers o f processing prospects for higher value addition over time. The
approach could be structured as follows, for each o f the activities:
i. evaluate the potential and quantity of, and access to these products;
ii. evaluate market expectations from the competitive transformation o f these
c ommoditie dproducts;
iii.for each o f the prospective “value chain clusters” assess the missing links in terms o f
structural responsiveness to markets expectation at micro, macro and spatial levels;
iv. design the necessary adjustments o f structures (bridging the gaps) strategies at micro, meso,
macro and spatial levels;
v. prioritize the sequence o f the adjustment o f structures process;
vi. identify nature and sources o f competencies required for implementation o f the strategy;
vii. design a coordination strategy.
The approach described above could form the basis for the terms o f reference o f a results-oriented
ESW task which could be the first step in designing an implementing a PSD-led growth strategy based
on “interface approaches to market-led opportunity development ”. The operational findings o f the
E S W could help design, step by step, all PSD project integrated components, from infrastructure
distribution and layout to regulatory framework adjustments and capacity-building schemes. T h i s
would provide a road map for the design and implementation o f the overall PSD-led growth strategy.
Improving the business environment should be a primary focus o f the Government. While government
ambitions in this area are explicit and private sector commitment to policy dialogue has been reiterated
on several occasions, identification and implementation of concrete lines o f action have yet to be
undertaken.

ANNEX I11- CHAD - IDA LENDING
AND DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

i)

Introduction

1. The provision of assistance under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative contributes significantly to
the reduction o f Chad’s external debt burden. When Chad reached the decision point under the
Enhanced H I P C Initiative in M a y 2001 i t ranked among the poorest countries in the world with a per
capita GDP o f US$188 and faced a high burden o f extemal debt. The level o f extemal public and
publicly guaranteed debt amounted to over a US$1.066 m i l l i o n in nominal terms. The NPV o f external
debt was estimated at US$566 m i l l i o n after traditional debt relief at end-2000. T o bring t h i s level down
t o the target level o f 150 percent, assistance amounting t o US$170.1 m i l l i o n in NPV terms would be
required. This translates into US$260 m i l l i o n in nominal terms over time.

2. The World Bank contributes to Chad’s debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative by
delivering IDA assistance of US%68.0 million in NPV terms. Beginning with interim relief in June
2001, IDA assistance is expected to provide 50 percent o f debt service falling due until the required
NPV reduction i s achieved at end-May 2015. At the decision point the average annual reduction in
debt service over t h i s time period amounts approximately to US$7.6 million. IDA contributes 40
percent o f the total assistance under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The exploitation of oil reserves largely determines Chad’s economic prospects and hence
debt sustainability. At the Decision Point o i l production was projected to start in 2005. The NPV o f

- 41

-

debt-to-exports ratio was expected to increase to 220.1 percent until 2003, remaining slightly above
200 percent in 2004. I t was expected that the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio stays above the target level
until o i l production would start and would more than quadruple exports from 2004 to 2005. The
Decision Point Document projected an NPV debt-to-exports ratio o f 86.4 percent in 2005, which i s
well below the HIPC threshold. From 2005 onwards exports were expected to continue increasing
further, reaching US$2082.3 million in 2008. As a consequence the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio
reduces substantially during t h i s period. After 2010 the exploitation o f o i l resources was projected to
decline sharply. Based on the assumption that growth in the non-oil sector more than offsets the
continuous decline in o i l revenues after 2010, the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratios was expected to
stabilize around 120 percent by 2020.

Updating the NPV o f Debt-to-Exports Ratio

ii)

4. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio will decline earlier than projected due to the acceleration
of oil production. In 2001 and 2002 exports were lower than projected in the Decision Point
Document largely due to a decline in the world market price for cotton, which i s Chad’s main export
commodity. As can be seen in Figure 2 updating exports in the Decision Point Scenario increases t h e
NPV debt-to-exports ratio during these two years. This changes in 2003 because o f the beginning o f o i l
production. The Chad-Cameroon pipeline was completed ahead o f schedule in late spring o f 2003. O i l
exports started recently in October 2003. This i s more than one year earlier than envisaged in the
Decision Point Document and consequently the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio with updated exports
declines earlier relative to the Decision Point projections. Updating the projections on exports within
the Decision Point Scenario does not affect the N P V debt-to-exports ratio in the long run.

The level o f new borrowing i s lower than projected at the decision point.’ In 2000 and 2001 new
borrowing was substantially lower than projected in the Decision Point Document leading t o a shortfall in
external financing o f about US$42.26 m i l l i o n at end-September 2001. Disbursement procedures o f the
European U n i o n were slower than expected and IDA’S SAC I V was approved in December 2001,
somewhat latter than originally envisaged. Similarly, in 2002 there was a significant shortfall in external
financing. The Bank’ s US$40 m i l l i o n fifth structural adjustment credit (SAC V) was expected in the fourth
quarter o f 2002 but not received until April 2003 because o f delays in the fulfillment o f conditions. F r o m
2004 onwards n e w borrowing projections are o n average 5 percent lower than projected at the Decision
Point. As a consequence the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio under the C A S base case lending scenario lies
below the Decision Point scenario with updated exports from 2001 on. At the end o f 2006, the NPV o f
debt-to-exports ratio under the C A S base case lending scenario i s projected to lie at 35.8 percent. H a d the
new borrowing been as h i g h as projected in the Decision Point Document the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio
would have been 2.3 percentage points hgher.

iii) Debt Sustainability under CAS Scenarios

6. Under all three lending scenarios proposed in the CAS the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio remains
below 150 percent from 2004 onwards.
Base-Case Lending: In the C A S base-case lending scenario, IDA lending for fiscal years 2004 to 2006
amounts to US$128 million, committing US$78 m i l l i o n in fiscal year 2004, US$20 m i l l i o n in fiscal year
2005 and US$30 m i l l i o n in fiscal year 2006. After fiscal year 2006 IDA lending i s projected to amount to
US$42.7 m i l l i o n annually, which is equal t o the average commitment o f t h i s C A S period. As can be seen
in Figure 3, the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio drops below 150 percent in 2004, reaching 36.9 percent in
2006. F r o m 2007 onwards it starts to increase, but remains w e l l below the 150 percent H I P C threshold until
the end o f the projection period reaching 111.3 percent in 2020.
High-Case Lending: Early and full implementation o f predefined measures that strengthen public f i a n c i a l
management would trigger high-case IDA lending. In the high-case scenario IDA lending increases by 30
percent during fiscal years 2004 to 2006, raising the total commitment during the C A S period f r o m U S $ l 2 8
m i l l i o n to US$166.4 million. This additional lending could take place through an increase in the PRSC
amount a n d o r investment operations in transport or electricity. The simulations for high-case lending
underlying Figure 3 are based o n the assumption that IDA lending in subsequent years also increases by 30
percent relative t o the base-case scenario. During the CAS period the NPV debt-to-exports ratio under the
high-case scenario i s only about one percentage point higher than under the base-case IDA lending
scenario. This gap increases towards the end o f the projection period, reaching 6.9 percentage points in
2020 with an NPV of debt-to-exports ratio under the high case-lending scenario o f 118.2 percent.
Low-Case Lending: A low-case lending scenario would be triggered if serious breaches in the provisions
o f o i l revenue management were to occur or a deterioration in IDA portfolio performance took place. The
low-case scenario underlying Figure 4 assumes that an IDA lending volume o f US$43 m i l l i o n i s evenly
distributed among calendar years 2004, 2005 and 2006 and that the lending volume in subsequent years
amounts to US$14.3 m i l l i o n per year. Under t h i s scenario the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio never exceeds
100 percent.

’

The simulations presented in the Annex of the CAS are updates of the Decision Point DSA. The Decision Point figures were updated
by actual new borrowing and exports between end 2000- end 2002. After 2002 updated projections on new borrowing and exports
were used. Furthermore, the figures on new borrowing take into account the different CAS scenarios. These simulations do not take
into account the evolution of exchange rates and discount rates. Given the sensitivity of the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio to these
factors, the results of the full DSA that will be conducted for the Completion Point may be subject to significant change.

7. Grant financing i s unlikely to play an important role for debt sustainability.
With a GNI per capita o f 220 in 2002 Chad has been eligible for grants in fiscal years 2003 and 2004
under the poorest country criteria, which states that I D A - o n l y countries with an annual per capita income
equal t o or less than US$360 may receive up to 23 percent o f its IDA allocation as grants. Grants in fiscal
year 2003 amounted to US$23.2. For fiscal year 2004 projected IDA commitments include grants o f US$17
million. In fiscal year 2005 grant allocation will decrease to US$7 million. The projected increase in GNI
per capita due t o o i l production makes it unlikely that Chad will be eligible for grants in the medium-term
apart f r o m H I V / A I D S grants. This implies that the effect o f grant allocation o n the NPV o f debt-to-exports
ratio i s likely to be negligible.

iv) Debt Sustainability under Different Export Scenarios
Given that the NPV of debt i s growing and oil exports are likely to decline, growth in the non-oil
export sectors i s crucial for maintaining debt sustainability.

Chad's NFV o f debt under the baseline scenario i s projected to grow steadily by 5.6 percent o n average
between 2004 and 2020. This implies that in the long-run, debt sustainability can only be maintained i f
growth in the export sector matches growth in the NPV o f debt. To assess the effect o f exports o n Chad's
debt sustainability, Figure 4 shows the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio under three different export scenarios.
Lower oil exports: Export Scenario A assumes that o i l exports are 25 percent lower between 2004 and
2020 than projected. This decrease in o i l exports raises the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio o n average by 10
percentage points during this period. However, the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio remains below 120
percent towards the end o f the projection period. Lower o i l exports are therefore unlikely to affect Chad's
debt sustainability significantly in the long-run which arises f r o m the fact that o i l exports decrease
substantially towards the end o f the projection period.

-

44 -

Lower growth of cotton and cattle exports: In the previous sections o f this analysis, cotton and cattle
exports were projected to grow by approximately 6 percent o n average between 2004 and 2020. Export
Scenario B revises these export growth rates significantly downwards, assuming an average annual growth
rates o f 2 percent for cotton and 3 percent for cattle. As can be seen in Figure 4, a reduction in the growth
rates o f cotton and cattle exports affects the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio during the C A S period only
marginally. The difference between the Base Case and t h i s export scenario does not exceed one percentage
point before 2010. But it increases substantially towards the end o f the projection period reaching 15.9
percentage points in 2020 with an NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio o f 127.2 percent under this lower export
growth scenario. Hence, there is a clear need to ensure that high sustained growth in these sectors are
realized, or that alternative non-traditional exports are developed.

Combining the effects: L o w e r o i l exports combined with lower export growth o f cotton and cattle imply
that the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio i s o n average 12.9 percentage points higher between 2004 and 2020
than in the Base Case. Given Base-Case lending, the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio will reach 137 percent in
2020. So far Base-Case lending has been assumed, but lower exports could translate into additional
borrowing needs. If lending increases, Chad i s likely to breach the 150 percent threshold. Under this export
scenario High-Case lending, for example, implies that Chad reaches an NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio o f 145
percent in 2020.

Conclusion

Chad’s l o n g t e r m debt sustainability i s r o b u s t t o the different IDA l e n d i n g scenarios. Long-term debt
sustainability however will largely depend o n whether Chad strengthens its institutions and generates
strong and sustained growth in the non-oil sector. With o i l revenues beginning to accrue, the medium-term
macroeconomic prospects are good. High expected o i l revenues o f US$lOO-130 m i l l i o n in 2004 and
US$160 m i l l i o n in 2005 and 2006 provide an opportunity for growth-enhancing investments in the
manufacturing, construction and public sector as w e l l as for strengthening Chad’s external position. But
after three decades o f c i v i l war, state and legal institutions are s t i l l weak. Oil production and exports will
bring about changes that make macroeconomic management itself more challenging. The projections o n
debt sustainability are based o n the assumption that annual growth rates will stabilize around 5 percent
between 2006 and 2015. This requires that Chad improves govemance for attracting domestic and foreign
private investment and designs and implements policies that generate growth in the non-oil sector. The
limited duration o f the o i l revenues makes it essential that the rest o f the economy i s transformed t o achieve
long-term g r o w t h and to maintain debt sustainable.
