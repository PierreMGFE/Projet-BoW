EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
European Choice: Encouraging Developments, Remaining Challenges

i.

Ukraine i s n o w in i t s fourth year o f strong and sustained economic growth. After a decade o f
economic decline, which halved i t s recorded economic output and raised the poverty rate to almost a third
of the population, GDP has rebounded by over 25 percent, and indications are that poverty rates,
measured by consumption, are beginning to decrease. The economy has also been strong o n the external
side, and a prudent fiscal policy has contributed to a reduction in public debt from 61 to 34 percent o f
GDP in three years. Ukraine has n o w regained access to Eurobond markets at relatively favorable terms.
11.
The breakthrough to economic growth in Ukraine has been a mixture o f revival o f o l d and
emergence o f n e w activities. External factors have helped; but new economic policies and reforms begun
since 1999, w h i c h have fostered the development o f market institutions (normalization o f payments and
o f pension and wage arrears, deregulation and substantial decreases in the cost o f doing business,
agricultural reform, etc.) have fostered the emergence o f a n e w private sector, a strong S M E presence and
diversification o f external trade away f r o m the o l d links with the CIS and towards the markets o f the
enlarged European Union. Ukraine n o w faces the difficult task o f ensuring the sustainability o f these
positive trends, and particularly to see to i t that the “new” aspects o f i t s economic growth are strengthened
through appropriate institutional and policy arrangements. Indeed, Ukraine has a substantial unfinished
agenda o f institutional reform ahead o f itself, if i t i s to fulfill i t s stated goal, the European Choice.

iii.
The institutional agenda has advanced also because o f the changing level o f development o f c i v i l
society that has taken place in the past few years, and the consequent increase in the voice o f the
Ukrainian citizenry in carrying out i t s o w n affairs. Consultations o n government policies are n o w
becoming more frequent, as i s the involvement o f citizens o n matters local and national, as evidenced f o r
instance in the conduct of the latest parliamentary elections. As Ukraine looks forward to i t s fourth
presidential election, a m u c h greater level of civic involvement at a l l levels i s discernible, providing an
increasing check o n the actions o f Government.
Questionsfor Discussion by Executive Directors

Directors m a y want to consider the following issues f o r discussion:

iv.

Does the proposed results-based nature o f the lending and non-lending programs adequately link
Bank assistance to the development objectives o f the country and client performance?
0

0

I s the proposed political risk mitigation convincing, and, analogously, i s the CAS poised to
exploit possible acceleration o f reform implementation following next year’s presidential
elections?
I s the proposed IFC strategy adequate to help accelerate the momentum o f improvement in the
business environment?

Lessons of the Past Country Assistance Strategy

v.
Prior to drafting the present strategy document, the W o r l d B a n k produced a C A S Completion
substantial accomplishments were
Report for the 2000-2003 strategy, with the following lessons: (i)
obtained in key areas of structural reform that have contributed to an overall improvement in Ukraine’s
socio-economic conditions; (ii)ownership is key: through the emphasis on support to Government
programs through the PAL sequence, the Bank i s n o w fully seen as a partner; (iii)
the emphasis o f the
2000 C A S o n developing avenues to facilitate civil society growth has been positive, and should b e
further strengthened in the future; (iv) IBRD-IFC collaboration and j o i n t w o r k o n issues o f private sector
development have found a good balance, capitalizing o n each institution’s comparative advantage.

..

11

vi.
The Review also points to some weaknesses in the general approach, as w e l l as in some
individual initiatives that are o f extreme importance for this CAS: (i)
problems have continued with the
elaboration and implementation of investment projects. The Bank needs to do a better j o b o f
understanding the political economy o f project lending; (ii)the experience o f direct lending to
municipalities has proven that this line o f business i s premature, and hence the Bank will rely o n a single
instrument (the proposed Municipal Development Fund) to foster fiscal accountability and responsiveness
at the local level while promoting modernization o f infrastructure; (iii)
lastly, a j o i n t plan was agreed
with Government to further streamline Government procedures with regard to IFIs lending.
Strategy for 2004-0 7

vii.
The Country Assistance Strategy for the period 2004-07 aims to support the European aspiration
of Ukraine by continuing to facilitate institutional developments that can lead to a business-friendly
environment and a more inclusive and responsive government, and emphasizing the need to build the
European aspiration both f r o m the top, through reform o f institutions and policies, and f r o m the bottom,
through the strengthening o f c i v i l society and the consequent increase in accountability o f public officials.
The Strategy i s results-based, and the amount o f financial assistance, as w e l l as the specific content o f the
lending and non-lending programs, will be strictly linked to the ability o f Government to attain the
relevant benchmarks.
viii.
The strategy i s also tailored to the realities o f the political cycle in the near and medium term. I t
recognizes the limited scope for n e w reform initiatives before the elections by focusing o n
implementation o f the reforms underway and agreed u p o n in the context o f the PAL I1 and PAL I11
discussions, as w e l l as in activities aimed at increasing voice o f c i v i l society. But following the
presidential elections, the strategy will provide for the possibility o f a High-Case lending scenario, based
o n Ukraine’s ability to seize the reform momentum and accomplish substantial advances in the Energy
Sector, Financial Sector, Public Sector accountability, and Social Sector reform. A C A S Update will
review this possibility in early FY06.

IBRD lending under the Base Case o f the Strategy could amount up to US$2.4 b i l l i o n over the
four-year period 2004-07, although this amount would only be attained if the ambitious targets chosen by
the government were indeed to be fulfilled o n time, and a l l four proposed Programmatic Adjustment
Loans were to materialize. Allowance i s also made for a more ambitious High Case, w h i c h could occur
after the next presidential elections (up to a m a x i m u m o f US$3 billion). Finally, a L o w Case w o u l d be
precipitated by return to macroeconomic instability if reversal o f reforms were to occur. In these
circumstances, IBRD lending would be limited, and IBRD exposure w o u l d not increase.
ix.

During the Strategy period, IFC also plans to substantially (but prudently) increase its investment
activities, n o w made possible by the improved business environment, and to continue in i t s flagship
program of technical assistance, targeted to SMEs and to selected thematic issues, in full coordination
with IBRD and other donors’ efforts in this area.
X.

Partnerships and Selectivity

xi.
Full utilization of synergies with other partners remains crucial in Ukraine as elsewhere. In this
respect, the Bank will continue to help the Government increase i t s o w n capacity t o exercise this
coordinating function. The Bank will also pay particular attention t o the increasing role likely to be
played by the European institutions as the relationships with the new neighbors are better defined after the
current round o f accessions.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
FOR UKRAINE
FOR 2004-07
I.

COUNTRY CONTEXT
A. INTRODUCTION

This i s the fourth Country Assistance Strategy o f the W o r l d Bank for Ukraine. A
1.
Country Assistance note was discussed together with the Ukraine Rehabilitation Loan (Report P6466-UA) o n November 30, 1994; the first stand-alone C A S (Report N o . 15674-UA) was
reviewed by the Board o f Executive Directors o n June 3, 1996; a C A S Update (SEC M98-425)
discussed o n M a y 21, 1998; and a subsequent C A S Progress Report (Report No. 19225) was
reviewed by the Board o n M a y 20, 1999. The most recent C A S was reviewed by the Board o n
September 16,2000.
2.
This document was prepared by a joint IBRD and IFC team, and benefited from
discussions with MIGA o n the role o f guarantees in Ukraine. The outlines o f the assistance
strategy have been discussed with the Government o f Ukraine and with a representative crosssection o f civil society, including members o f the Verkhovna Rada (parliament), representatives
o f the business community and local governments, civic organizations, think-tanks, and NGOs,
both in Kyiv and in several locations across Ukraine. The results o f the discussions have been
incorporated in the strategy and are summarized in Attachment 1. Full details o f the
consultations can be found at www.worldbank.org/ukrainecas.

B. KEYECONOMIC,
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT
Economic Developments

3.
Since the last Country Assistance Strategy for Ukraine was presented to the Board in
2000, economic developments have turned positive (Table 1). Following a decade o f severe
economic decline, Ukrainian GDP rebounded by an estimated 20 percent over the three-year
period of 2000-2002, and sustained economic growth continues in 2003. Investment, wages, and
incomes have all exhibited strong upward trends. Substantial trade and current account deficits
have turned to surplus, while the general government budget deficit narrowed considerably
(indeed registering a small surplus in 2002). Foreign exchange reserves have quadrupled, and
n o w stand at close to US$6.85 billion. Inflation fell t o low, even negligible levels in 2001-2002.
Financial markets, particularly the banking sector, have also picked up.
4.
The breakthrough to economic growth in Ukraine can be associated with a number o f
factors (See B o x 1, Explaining the Economic Recovery in Ukraine). Some of them, such as
changes in exchange rates, world price movements, and the revival of the neighboring Russian
economy, are external in nature. They have changed the terms o f trade, demand, and payment
conditions faced by Ukrainian f i r m s o n world markets. They have permitted the partial revival

performance while efforts are
ongoing to mitigate social
and environmental risks as the economy adjusts. Since 1999, the Ukrainian political pendulum
has swung strongly in the direction o f economic reform and the development o f market
institutions, with an underlying goal o f greater integration with the European Union. A great
number o f inter-related achievements have been made, supported in large measure by the PAL
Program (See PAL At-a-Glance in Attachment 4). Among these, the budget process has been
improved and commitments are under control - normalization o f payments and o f pension and
wage arrears have buoyed domestic demand. Significant progress has been made on payment
discipline, regulation and privatization in the energy sector. The practice o f mutual offsets with
the budget has been eliminated which has helped spur dramatic increases in money demand.
L o w inflation, deposit inflows into the banking sector, better financial regulatory policy and an
improved legal framework have set the stage for dramatic increases in domestic financial
intermediation and investment. Deregulation and substantial decreases in the cost o f doing
business have permitted the emergence o f a new private sector, particularly in the SME area.
Agriculture has seen substantial restructuring and modernization. This has also led to incipient
diversification o f external trade away from the o l d l i n k s with the CIS and towards the markets o f
the enlarged European Union.

Indicators

5.
Thus, the recovery o f the past few years has been a mixture o f revival o f old and
emergence of new activities. Ukraine n o w faces the difficult task o f ensuring the sustainability
o f these positive trends, and particularly to see to it that the “new” aspects o f i t s economic
growth are strengthened through appropriate institutional and policy arrangements. F o r this to
occur, continued improvements in the business environment need to be accomplished: reversals
in the degree o f liberalization and deregulation already achieved could lead to chilling
consequences o n growth, and stifle the drive for modernization o f the economy. In addition, the
experience o f the past few years poses another challenge: ensuring that the improvements in
economic indicators are matched by positive movements in the most important social areas, and
particularly with regard to poverty.
Social Developments
Poverv. Until 2002, the impact o f the economic recovery on poverty was less than
6.
hoped for (see B o x 2, Poverty in Ukraine - Slow but Encouraging Improvements). Using a

3
variety of consumption-based measures o f poverty, the number o f Ukrainians falling below the
poverty l i n e may have even inched up by 2001, before it started to decline. W h i l e absolute
poverty i s l o w by international standards, using the local definition o f poverty, about a quarter o f
the Ukrainian population remained below the poverty line by the third quarter o f 2002. The
poverty rate responded only slowly to substantial increases in real wages (resulting from an
improved economic situation) and gains in real pensions resulting f r o m greater financial
discipline and the elimination o f pension and wage arrears.

7.

What explains this delayed outcome? There i s no single, or clear causal factor that the
data point to; further research will n o doubt increase our insights on this phenomenon, which i s
shared by other transition economies (i.e. Poland, Albania, Armenia) but not all. In the case o f
Ukraine, some partial indications already offer interesting insights. Available data, for instance,
point to the emergence o f a dichotomy between rural and (large) urban areas, with the latter
being major beneficiaries o f the new growth and, despite somewhat increasing inequality, are
able to lift people out o f poverty. On the contrary, rural areas appear to have experienced
substantial increases in poverty through 200 1, despite the recovery in agricultural production o f
the past three years. The poverty rate by the first three quarters o f 2002 continues to be higher
than that o f 1999. Labor shedding resulting from restructuring and privatization o f former
collective farms has not been matched by labor creation outside agriculture. I t i s also apparent,
as has been the case in many former socialist countries, that the quality o f education i s an
important determinant o f economic success, and hence o f the probability o f moving out o f
poverty. Other common traits o f poverty in the CIS are also confirmed (families with many
children, single pensioners).

8.
Millennium Development Goals: Taking Stock. In addition to the income dimension o f
poverty just discussed, there are a number o f other indicators o f human development affecting
the quality o f life o f Ukrainian citizens that have seen unfavorable developments. The departure
point was relatively high. Ukraine shared with the rest o f the former Soviet U n i o n countries
relatively good socioeconomic indicators, with high levels o f education, l o w gender
differentiation (see Box. 4, Gender Issues in Ukraine), relatively good infrastructure. Although
the reliability o f some o f the official statistics, particularly in the 1980s, has been questioned, and
most certainly the record on environmental sustainability l e f t much to be desired, it i s undeniable
that the dissolution o f the Soviet U n i o n and the economic depression o f the 1990s led to sharp
worsening in several key indicators in the welfare of the population. The trend was reversed
since the mid-nineties with regard to several key indicators (maternal and infant mortality),
however the situation has not improved with regard to adult health and TB/HIV. Recent
evidence from a household survey indicates that Ukraine faces serious problems with access to
essential health services - 40 percent o f the population in the poorest decile could not use health
services when ill compared to 20 percent in the richest decile. Partly as a result o f these
deficiencies, tuberculosis increased dramatically after 1990, (when Ukraine reported i t s lowest
tuberculosis case rate - 32 per 100,000), and by 2001 the case rate had more than doubled to 75
per 100,000, After 1995 HIV also began spreading rapidly, from 1,500 diagnosed infections in
1995 to an estimated 50,000 infected adults and children in 2002. And as far as educational
outcomes are concerned, in the absence o f clear measures o f quality, enrollment data (admittedly
a very rough correlate) show a mixed picture, with improvement in enrollments in primary
education (from 85.8 percent in 1995 to 90 percent in 2001) but a drop in enrollment in lower
secondary (from 96.8 percent in 1995 to 92.9 in 2001) and a drop in pre-school (from 51.4
percent in 1995 to 43.9 in 2001).

4
BOX 1. EXPLAININGTHE ECONOMIC
RECOVERY
IN UKRAINE

The strong recovery o f output that began in mid-1999, and which continues at more moderate but sustained
tempo in 2003, has features o f both old and new. Initially due to one-time factors, it has gained momentum, but
w i t h potential to fizzle if improvements in the business environment do not continue. There are three elements
to the recent growth performance.

First, a number o f one-offfactors provided an impetus that i s likely to be exhausted. The devaluation
of 1998-99, together w i t h the revival o f growth in Russia, provided increased demand for some o f the
traditional, metal-based industries o f Ukraine, which had ample spare capacity following the large
declines in production o f the 1990s. In addition, parts o f unregistered economic activities started
moving t o the official sector, affecting mainly small enterprises (now enjoying the positive effects of
the simplified taxation system). These latter changes do not necessarily mean an increase in the overall
level (Le. registered and unregistered) o f economic activity, at least as first-round effect. However,
moving f r o m the unregistered to the registered sector, and limiting non-monetary forms o f transactions
can help in improving fiscal and payment discipline, contract enforcement, budget-revenue collection,
economy re-monetization and de-dollarization, and can create more room for further economic
expansion.
Second, a number o f policy steps having a disciplining and deregulating character were undertaken,
which, however, need to be sustained over time. These include enhanced tax and payments discipline;
elimination o f arrears, barter and other kinds o f non-monetary or quasi-monetary transactions; and
imposing ‘hard budget constraints,’ The economy benefited substantially from the sharp reduction in
barter and netting-out operations, particularly in relation to budget and energy suppliers. By i t s nature,
they need a continuous political w i l l and effort to be enforced. Similarly, relaxation o f price and
quantity controls in agriculture in 2000 gave a positive impact to grain production in 2001. However,
there i s a permanent political temptation to resort to this instrument, particularly before election
campaigns.
Third, there were more durable changes, mainly o f systemic and institutional character, which should
bring positive effects over the longer term. The effects o f the privatization process, regardless o f the
controversies around its speed, transparency, and quality, are an important example. The same can be
said about the development o f the financial sector, legislative changes concerning budget procedures,
inter-governmental fiscal relations, and hopefully agriculture-land tumover.

These indications point to the need to re-examine the anti-poverty focus o f different
aspects o f the Government’s strategy. As will be discussed later, this implies a close look at
altemative options for rural development; accelerated reform o f the social benefit system; further
simplification o f the environment for SME development; and a hard look at public service
delivery.

9.

Development of Civil Society. Gauging by the broad measures o f human development
10.
just discussed, the situation at the start o f the new C A S period i s mixed. What the statistical data
cannot easily show, however, i s the changing level of development o f c i v i l society that has taken
place in the past few years, and the consequent increase in the voice o f the Ukrainian citizenry in
carrying out i t s o w n affairs. Ukraine inherited f r o m the Soviet U n i o n a weak civil society,
characterized by l o w involvement in civic affairs, and dependence on the central authorities for
financial and organizational resources. Unlike Central Europe, the political transformation o f the
early 1990s was essentially carried out f r o m the top. The f i r s t few years o f national
consolidation thus provided the opportunity for the rapid seizure o f important positions o f power
by newly formed economic groups, while the population at large experienced disenfranchisement
and increasing skepticism with regard to the reforms. This situation has gradually changed.
Consultations o n Government policies are becoming more frequent, as i s the involvement o f
citizens on local and national matters, as evidenced for instance in the conduct o f the latest

5
parliamentary elections. As Ukraine looks forward to i t s fourth presidential election a much
greater level o f civic involvement at all levels i s discemible, providing an increasing check o n
the actions o f Govemment.

External Political Environment

11.
The extemal environment for Ukraine has changed markedly in the recent past. I t s
traditional two-vector policy, which helped in the past to elicit strong support from the West,
while maintaining critical l i n k s with Russia, has been weakened by the changing international
realities. In this context, Ukrainian official programs increasingly emphasize the l i n k s to Europe
as the essential medium-term objective o f national policies. The Government has opted for an
economic and social strategy o f European Choice. The approximation to Europe i s seen as a
medium-term political tendency, with broad national ownership, that will permeate all aspects o f
political and economic change in the country. Naturally, as in the past, the relationship with the
members of the CIS also remains very important, and a number o f initiatives for closer economic
integration have been developed or are under consideration. But the drive for harmonization
with the European Union, even in the absence o f a clear prospect for accession, i s likely to
provide an increasingly stronger impetus to institutional and policy reform.
12.
The practical implication o f the European Choice with regard to formal ties with the
European U n i o n will depend o n many factors that are difficult to forecast at present. The EU has
begun to assess options relative to i t s future relations with what will become the “near abroad”
after accession o f present candidate countries.’ I t offers a paradigm to expand o n the existing
Partnership and Cooperation Agreement along several areas o f extreme importance to Ukraine,
from access to the EU markets, to investments, to common security issues, etc. This new
framework i s to be developed on a case-by-case basis, and the extent o f the intensification o f the
relationship will depend on the ability o f individual countries to commit to increased
harmonization with the Acquis Communautaire.
13. I t i s thus to be expected that the features o f future relationships between Ukraine and the EU
will take time to shape, and will depend, among other factors, o n the degree o f success o f the
integration o f the Accession countries. Over the next few years, however, the European
aspiration provides a good opportunity for Ukraine to move in a direction encouraging marketoriented and institution-building reforms.

BOX 2: POVERTY IN UKRAINE - SLOW BUT ENCOURAGINGIMPROVEMENTS

The World Bank poverty line for Ukraine in the first three quarters o f 2002, the latest data available as o f July
2003, equaled 2,423 UHR annually, in terms o f adult equivalent expenditure, for a headcount poverty rate
equal to 25.6 percent. The poverty measure i s based on 75 percent o f median expenditures in 1999, scaled for
family composition, and adjusted for price inflation, to abstract from changes in inequality. Ukraine prefers a
relative rather than an absolute measure o f poverty, similar to the measurement choices made by EU countries.
Based on the first three quarters o f data for 1999-2002, the poverty rate in Ukraine declined substantially
(between 2001 and 2002 by 6.0 percentage points), in an apparently lagged response to strong economic
growth.

The poverty rate declined continuously in Kyiv City between 1999 and 2002 (three quarter rates), falling to a
very l o w 7.7 percent. By contrast, the poverty rate in rural areas, while under the 2002 third-quarter peak, was
still higher than that for the first three quarters o f 1999, immediately after the Russian crisis. These findings
suggest that the response to growth in rural areas i s the weakest with persistent poverty remaining despite
gains elsewhere.

Poverty rates based o n alternative CPI measures also tended. to peak in 2001 and fall in 2002. The initial
stickiness in the poverty rate in the face o f economic growth in Ukraine was similar to other transition
economies including Albania, Armenia, and Poland. One possible explanation for the lag in the reduction o f
the poverty rate i s that initial growth was centered in l o w value-added sectors. Agricultural growth could also
have bypassed income-generating employment, w i t h gains going primarily to administrators. This could be
the reason that rural poverty i s still relatively high. Another hypothesis explaining the lag i s that the economy
became more formalized between 1999 and 2001, and the formalization o f wages might not have been
translated into gains in consumption if equivalent informal income received previously went unreported.
Who are the poor? In 2001 poverty rates were higher among the unemployed, pensioners over age 85, and
social pensioners; 2001 poverty rates were above 40 percent for each. Poverty rates were higher among
workers in the informal sector and rose to more than 40 percent for families w i t h children whose primary
activity was working on their own plot. However, the bulk o f households in poverty were families with
children and the elderly, even if the poverty rates o f these groups were not much higher than the poverty rate
overall. Fifty-one percent o f households in poverty included children and another 37 percent included persons
over pension age. These vulnerable households should be a top priority for government poverty reduction
policies.

BOX 3. ADAPTING THE MDGS TO THE UKRAINIAN CONTEXT

Ukraine has committed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). A national debate has taken place
inthe past few months, with the participation o f experts from Government and Ukrainian academia, in cooperation
with the representatives o f UNDP, W o r l d Bank, and donor agencies. The purpose o f the debate was t o adjust the
broad MDG goals t o the Ukrainian reality; to develop monitoring indicators relevant t o Ukraine’s situation; and t o
prepare recommendations that might assist the Ukrainian Government in achieving progress in social
development. Due to Ukraine’s relatively high level o f social development, the country’s main concern is t o
preserve its achievements and safeguard against the risk o f further social and environmental degradation under the
pressures o f economic and social transition.
The original contents o f Goal 1 relate to eradication o f extreme poverty and hunger and are incommensurate w i t h
the situation in Ukraine, as hunger i s not a case for concern here. Although poverty i s a major problem in Ukraine,
it has not assumed extreme dimensions. Extreme poverty measured using the absolute poverty line o f $1 per
person per day (using the PPP exchange rate) does not exist in Ukraine (0.05% in 2000). The absolute poverty line
o f $4.3 and national relative poverty line were used t o adequately capture the serious poverty problem in Ukraine.
Given the weight o f the problem, an ambitious target has been proposed, namely to halve the number o f population
living below the poverty line o f $4.3 by 2015.
Goal 2 relates to access to primary education. In Ukraine the access not only t o primary but also to general
secondary education i s virtually universal, consequently the ultimate goal was defined as raising the quality of
education as a whole, which will be measured through a national assessment system t o be introduced.
Goal 3 originally relates to gender disparities in primary and secondary education. Although the problem of
gender inequality exists in Ukraine, it has little influence o n access to education. However, some gender
inequalities in Ukraine are found in the labor market in terms o f employee compensation and representation in the
Parliament, as well as among senior civil servants. Thus, the Ukrainian targets were developed to address these
specific issues.
Although Ukraine has experienced a slight decline in child and maternal mortality, the original Goals 4 and 5 were
considered relevant t o Ukraine. T hus, a 17% reduction target i n b 0th c hild under-five mortality and maternal
mortality rates was set to be achieved during the 2001-2015 period. In addition to internationally accepted MDG
goals, Ukraine also needs t o address high death rates among working age population, in particular males. This
would have the highest impact o n improving overall life expectancy.
Ukraine faces a rapid explosion o f tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. The Ukrainian target, Goal 6, i s t o decrease the
TB and H I V / A I D S prevalence rates.
Goal 7, “Ensure Environmental Sustainability,” and i t s three targets are relevant to Ukraine. (These include the
following: Target 9: integrate environment into policies and reverse loss o f resources; Target 10: halve by 2015
the proportion o f people without sustainable access to safe drinking water; Target 11: by 2020, achieve a
significant improvement in the lives o f at least 100 million slum dwellers). In relation to these, there i s an urgent
need to integrate environmental considerations in industrial, energy, and agricultural sectors, especially so as to
improve energy efficiency. B o t h quality (safety) and quantity (accesdavailability) o f drinking water, deterioration
o f municipal infrastructure, and lack o f sanitation facilities are burning issues in many regions o f the country,
especially in rural areas. Furthermore the institutional capacity t o ensure proper integration o f environmental
sustainability into mainstream decision-making needs substantial strengthening. Finally, the goal also requires
improvements in the quality o f the urban environment and addressing k e y concerns relating to forestry and
biodiversity conservation. At the very least these will require better monitoring o f the situation with respect to
these indicators.
The year 2001 was chosen as the reference point for the future, and the 1999-2001 period was subject for analysis
to identify the trends for indicators. The goals set for the future are to be achieved over ten to fifteen years.
Estimation o f the future value o f indicators was based o n an analysis o f trends recorded so far, as well as o n
international comparisons. I t was agreed that the level o f indicators would provide a benchmark for the
Government and international institutions for monitoring the country’s development in identified fields.

GENDER
ISSUES
IN UKRAINE

Based o n the 2000 Ukraine CAS focus o n building demand for better governance and increasing the supply of
better, development-oriented institutions, the Ukraine Country Department carried out a Gender Review. The aim
o f the Review was to identify h o w transition had differentially affected men and women. The Review contributed
to opening up the discussion o n gender issues with the GOU and civil society and developed recommendations for
increasing gender equity. The Review i s based o n a literature review; household survey data from the State
Committee o f Statistics; and discussions with Ukrainian Government counterparts, donors, civil society
organizations, beneficiaries, and academics in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, and Lviv oblasts.
The Review covered the following areas: gender and poverty, labor market, health, trafficking and domestic
violence, family relations, and political participation. Poverty analysis revealed that although women and men had
virtually the same rate o f poverty in 2000, there are slightly more poor female-headed than male-headed
households, and children face an increased risk o f poverty. In the labor market, despite equal educational levels,
women outnumber men in lower-skilled, poorly paying jobs, including those in the informal sector and shuttle
trade. Women own or manage fewer businesses than men, have less access t o capital, and report greater
harassment f r o m authorities. Women complain o f greater discrimination in hiring, while young single women in
the private sector are vulnerable t o sexual harassment. Mothers are disadvantaged by the lack o f affordable child
care. There has been a dramatic increase in male mortality, with alcohol and smoking related illnesses playing a
major role. Levels o f H I V / A I D S and STIs have soared. T o date, drug users, a majority o f whom are men, are
primary victims o f HIVIAIDS. A reverse trend has begun with an H I V / A I D S increase among commercial sex
workers, most o f whom are women. There i s a serious dearth o f sex education in schools as well as o f family
planning facilities, particularly in rural areas. Increased drug and alcohol use appear t o be contributing t o youth
violence.

,

Family structure i s c hanging as the marriage rate falls a n d the number o f o ut-of-wedlock births (including t o
minors) increases. Gender stereotypes continue to prevail. Women have the advantage in custody disputes,
although there i s little enforcement o f child support payments or property rights; at the same time, men feel that
fatherhood i s devalued. Domestic abuse, primarily toward women and children, i s increasingly acknowledged by
victims, police, and officials as a serious public concern; although the police and the legal systems are s t i l l not
equipped to respond effectively, and few social services are available to victims. Despite public information
campaigns, trafficking, particularly in Western Ukraine, continues to attract women who see n o viable economic
alternative. In the arena o f political participation, men far outnumber women in higher echelons o f government
and parliament while women have less access t o the important networks and capital essential for obtaining political
office. At the same time, active women have become more engaged in N G O s and other civic associations.
Recommendations included qualitative research o n intrahousehold distribution o f consumption; a multi-pronged
approach t o reduce sexual harassment o n the job, including more explicit legislation, incentives for enforcement,
and a public information campaign o n legal rights; some form o f state assistance to help poorer women pay for
child care facilities and also b enefit c h l d r e n f r o m disadvantaged households; and a public health campaign t o
influence life-style choices (alcohol, smoking, diet and exercise, and safe sex), supplemented by specific programs
targeting schoolchildren. Employment creation schemes targeted at women who are unskilled, and/or rural, and/or
single mothers could help reduce their vulnerability to trafficking. Legal and judicial reform projects should
include components to increase legal access f o r low-income men and women regarding their rights in cases of
divorce-related property and custody disputes.

C. DEVELOPMENT
AGENDAAND GOVERNMENT
PROGRAM

14.
The discussion in the previous section highlights Ukraine’s formidable institutional
r e f o r m agenda, despite the accomplishments o f the past three years, if i t i s t o meet the challenge
posed by i t s European Choice and to m a k e a substantial dent in the l e v e l o f poverty. The
challenge for Ukraine i s not so m u c h the creation o f n e w institutions (although these m a y b e
needed in several areas, as discussed below), but rather bridging the gap between the stated r o l e
of emerging institutions and their behavior in practice. T h i s section reviews the m a i n
improvements as w e l l as the shortcomings, and discusses the forward agenda for Ukraine, and
the Government Program.

10

Progress on the Structural Agenda in the Past Three Years
15.
A brief review o f the achievements o f the past three years in key areas that were
highlighted in the 2000 CAS i s useful to appreciate the magnitude o f the remaining task. The
macroeconomic outcomes have already been discussed as well as developments in the poverty
front. With regard to the structural and institutional reform agenda, progress i s visible in a
number o f areas (see Table 2, M a i n Indicators o f Structural Improvement).
0

With regard to fiscal and financial discipline, a remarkable turnaround in the cash
payments performance in the energy sector has been registered (cash payments have risen
from a l o w o f 10 percent in 1999 to about 90 percent in early 2003). With regard to
public sector payments, the non-transparent practice o f mutual offsets has been
eliminated, and all pension and wage arrears, as well as most social arrears have been
substantially reduced.

environment has contributed to a boom in the creation o f small and medium enterprises.
Substantial advances have also been registered in improving the regulatory environment
in the financial sector, with the strengthening o f the supervisory functions o f the NBU,
and the establishment o f a non-bank financial regulator. One large insolvent bank (Bank
Ukraina) was closed, and the Savings Bank i s now being rehabilitated.
With regard to protection of property rights, Ukraine has witnessed substantial advances
in land reform and privatization, with the adoption o f a modern land code, the abolition
o f Kolkhozes and the wholesale distribution o f millions o f titles to peasant-owners, with
rapidly advancing proper title registration. The privatization process has continued in the
industrial sector (albeit at a slower-than-expected pace), and greater transparency o f
transactions has been verified.
With regard to public sector efficiency and accountability, the adoption o f a modern
budget code has clarified the rules for transfers among different levels o f Government
and has supported improvements in budgetary management and state finance. The
unification o f the State Treasury and its modernization (aided by a World Bank project)
has brought greater accountability to the use o f public resources, as has the adoption and
implementation o f a public procurement law.

With regard to social and environmental sustainability, progress has been registered in
streamlining, and improved administration, o f the system o f social benefits and social
assistance. A national debate has been launched on the future o f the pension system and
has h elped build c onsensus o n t h e m ajor directions o f p ension r eform. Most recently
Parliament approved two important pieces o f legislation enabling the creation o f a multipillar pension system. National long- t e r m strategies for reform o f health and education
have been adopted, which recognize the need to ensure equal access to quality education
and to re-align expenditures with financing in health. In addition, initial steps in
restructuring primary health care and streamlining the education system are being
undertaken. In the environmental area, indexation o f environmental fees and fines i s now

11
in place and the Government i s looking seriously at the other recommendations o f the
Bank-sponsored Environmental Expenditure Review to improve efficiency o f
environmental expenditures. The Government has also begun work o n defining national
environmental priorities that will address the key environmental issues in the context o f
the environmental and other M D G s (See B o x 3, Adapting the MDGs to the Ukrainian
Context). Finally, the country has adopted and begun to implement a strategy to deal
with the growing TB and HIV epidemics (also in this case with the help o f a World Bank
project).

16.
In summary, despite the heated political debates and Government instability, Ukraine can
point to a number o f accomplishments that have created a more favorable environment for
business and greater accountability o f public expenditures. If sustained through h r t h e r reform,
these accomplishments pose the basis for continued growth and modernization o f the economy.

Weaknesses of the Past Three Years and the Forward Agenda
17.
However, progress has been lackluster in a number o f critical areas o f reform. The three
PAL s equence under the 2 000-2003 C AS h as p rogressed m ore s l o w l y than i t c ould have (an
outcome that was anticipated as a in the 2000 CAS). Only one o f three operations was approved
by the Board during the CAS period; a second one i s scheduled for presentation in December
2003.

Government Agenda
19.
On April 16,2003, the Ukrainian Rada approved with a large majority the program o f the
Yanukovych Government. This ambitious document provides a fair degree o f continuity with

12
respect to the programs o f past administrations. Central to this program, and several Presidential
Programs previously issued, i s the idea o f European Choice, which commits the country to move
in the direction o f European market institutions. The program comprises a number o f actions to
shore up reform in the next eighteen months, and a more complex institutional development
agenda to be addressed over the medium term. The most important issues that the Government
intends to confront over the next eighteen months to ensure that the pace o f modernization o f the
economy i s not lost are the following:

In the Energy Sector, the reform agenda comprises: (i)
in the power sector, interenterprise debt resolution as a precondition for future privatization o f electricity
distribution and thermal generating companies and increased investments to ensure
reliability o f energy supplies; (ii)
in the coal sector, adjustments in pricing, accompanied
by further downsizing o f mines suffering heavy losses; and (iii)
in the gas sector, greater
transparency in the operations o f Naftagaz and i t s affiliates, with associated
improvements in their financial performance, particularly with regard to tax arrears. All
these reforms will have a positive impact o n energy efficiency in the country, as w e l l as
in reducing emissions o f pollutants that are harmful to human health. In this way they
will contribute to important environmental goals, as articulated in the MDGs.

Tax Reform i s o n the agenda, and a significant effort i s required to further simplify the
system and broaden the tax base, control growth o f tax arrears, reduce incentives for
economic activity to remain underground, and reduce administrative discretion. Positive
steps have recently been taken with the reforms o f the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and
the Personal Income Tax (PIT). Reforms to the VAT are now being considered by the
Rada.
In the Social Sectors, further reforms are needed in the area o f social security and social
benefits, with the aim o f reducing and eventually eliminating untargeted programs and
increasing the effectiveness o f public moneys in reducing poverty among the most at-risk
groups.

On the Environment, the program will consist o f following through with the
recommendations o f the Environmental Expenditure Review. The program also needs to
institute reforms in the management o f public funds, which will increase the effectiveness
o f these expenditures as well as ensure a closer linkage to the priorities, as defined in the
environmental MDG and as further elaborated in the National Environmental Strategy.
In this context it will also include better monitoring o f expenditures, as w e l l as tracking
the environmental indicators that record the achievement o f the environmental MDG (on
energy efficiency, access to improved water supply, and sanitation and environmental
sustainability).
In Agriculture, the priority task i s to finish issuing land titles and to continue with the
creation and strengthening o f the institutions o f the market infrastructure, capitalizing on
the progress o f the past three years.
In the Financial Sector, the continued rehabilitation o f the Savings Bank has top priority
over the short term; Government has reasserted control over i t s management, and
implemented strict limits o n lending, and will develop a strategic vision for the Bank’s
future. O f great importance i s also the approval by Parliament o f key pieces o f

13
legislation (e.g., Creditors’ rights; the Mortgage L a w was approved very recently)
required t o shore up the foundations for development o f credit markets. Additionally, the
strengthening o f the newly established Regulator o f Non-Bank Financial Institutions and
Markets in Ukraine should have high priority, in view o f the growth o f this segment o f
financial markets. Finally, another priority o f the Government i s to be removed from the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Non-Cooperative Country blacklist by the end o f
2003. T o accomplish this objective they need to demonstrate effective implementation o f
their anti-money laundering controls. Although legislation went into effect o n June 12,
2003 certain things s t i l l remain to be done, including issuing implementing regulations
for the non-banking sector, making the Financial Intelligence Unit fully operational, and
training and auditing against the National Bank Money Laundering regulations. Ukraine
will also have to demonstrate that the AML program has sufficient political support and
resources to make it irreversible.
0

In the area o f Business Environment, further improvements are possible even in the short
run, provided that temptations to interfere with market mechanisms are contained.
Crucial elements to improve the business environment in the short run also include the
implementation o f the tax reform, the continued modernization and de-politicization o f
the tax administration, and improvements by the judiciary in handling cases affecting
business transactions.

Medium-Term Agenda and Framework for Result Orientation

20.
Beyond the need to ensure continuity o f reforms in the short run, Ukraine needs to
concentrate o n the longer-term challenges required for poverty reduction and the fulfillment o f
i t s European Choice. Based o n the Government program as well as o n several Presidential
strategies and visions issued in the past few years, and building on the experience gained through
implementation o f the PAL sequence, the Government and the Bank have engaged in a
substantive discussion on the meaning and measurement o f results, with respect to the
Government’s o w n program, and with respect t o the agreed work program embodied in this
CAS.
21.
Table 3 provides a concise illustration o f the long-term objectives that correspond to the
vision for Ukraine supported by this CAS; the target areas o f concern; and the indicators that
have been selected to gauge progress in attaining those targets (the entire framework i s presented
in the matrix in Annex B9). Withn the framework o f European Choice, the Government intends
to emphasize the following seven long-term objectives: (i)
Sustainable Economic Growth; (ii)
Poverty Reduction and the Strengthening o f the Middle Class; (iii)Comprehensive and
Harmonized Human Development; (iv) Environmental Sustainability; (v) Gradual Integration
into the World Economic and Financial Systems; (vi) Reduction o f Regional Imbalances; (vii)
Improvement o f State Administration. The W o r l d Bank Group strategy discussed in the next
section will support these objectives while capitalizing o n the areas o f strength and comparative
advantage o f the Bank, namely support to institutional reform in key areas where a dialogue has
proven fi-uitfid in the past (agriculture, energy, social sectors), strengthening o f accountability o f
public institutions w i t h work both at the center and with c i v i l society. Thus, not all government
objectives will necessarily be supported by Bank interventions. The challenges relative to each
objective are:

14

22.

Objective I : Sustainable Economic Growth. To maintain the momentum o f growth in
the medium term, the Government program highlights three priority areas, namely: (i)
Creation
of conditions conducive to further development o f entrepreneurship and property rights
protection; (ii)
Creation o f a favorable investment climate; and (iii)
Support for the innovation
model o f development, creation o f a knowledge economy, and fblfillment o f high-tech
aspirations.

23.
In order to achieve these targets, actions are expected to continue along several lines. On
the macroeconomic front, prudent fiscal and monetary policies will continue to be implemented.
The structure o f public expenditures and revenues will be strengthened through continuing tax
reform, reduction in tax privileges, enforcement o f payments discipline, particularly in the
energy sector, a n d continued reform o f the most important chapters o f public spending (from
untargeted subsidies, to health, education, and targeted social assistance). Particular attention
will be paid to limiting risks that the energy sector poses for macroeconomic stability and fiscal
sustainability, and assuring that the energy needs o f the economy are met satisfactorily.
Strengtheningregulation o f the banking and non-banking financial sector (bringing it in line with
the Base1 Core Principles) will also help stabilize macroeconomics and increased availability o f
resources to the economy. Support for the development o f market institutions in agriculture
should help develop a sector where Ukraine has significant comparative advantage.
24.
In addition, sustaining the growth rate o f the past few years will require progress in
improving the business environment, by further simplifying and streamlining the formal and
informal regulatory burden. The Government gives high priority to SME growth, which i s seen
as not only a vehicle for economic growth, but also as a generator o f employment opportunities
and facilitator o f labor reallocation in the economy. A solid macroeconomic framework and an
improved business environment should lead to higher investment to GDP ratios, a greater inflow
o f direct foreign investment, and further SME growth. These developments would be aided
further by actions that continue to strengthen payments discipline, and increase certainty o f
property rights. The Government i s also keen to develop a knowledge economy, with emphasis
o n innovation. This will be achieved by facilitating the restructuring o f the economy, helping
improve corporate governance, and implementing the new privatization program. Additionally,
the Government will develop a Knowledge Economy Strategy and start its implementation
during this CAS period.

25.
Objective 2: Poverty Reduction and Strengthening of the Middle Class. The challenge
for the Government will be to help translate the benefits o f growth to the entire population and
reduce the incidence o f poverty. To do this, the Government plans to build o n and revise the
“Strategy for Poverty Reduction” issued during the last CAS period. Taking into account the
emerging features o f poverty in Ukraine discussed earlier, two key principles o f the revised
strategy will be: (i)
better conditions for j o b creation in the private sector, particularly the rural
areas, and (ii)
guarantee o f an efficient use o f public resources, with emphasis o n the targeted
provision o f social assistance and comprehensive pension reform. Poverty reduction and salary
increases, along with increased productivity, will help build and strengthen the middle class in
Ukraine. Moreover, the Government plans to propose to parliament revisions o f payroll tax
rates, which, as they stand today, discourage j o b creation by employers, particularly in SMEs. A
broadening o f the tax bases and lowering o f tax rates should help the formal economy grow.
Lastly, increasing educational standards and fostering active development o f c i v i l society will
serve to build a strong middle class.

15

26.
Objective 3: Comprehensive and Harmonized Human Development. An important
element o f the Government’s European Choice i s the development o f a healthy and highly
educated citizenry, within a framework o f assured rights and freedoms. In both health and
education the Government plans to implement strategies geared to increasing the quality o f
services and reducing delivery costs; hence, there i s an emphasis o n simplifying the existing
service delivery networks a n d developing standards t o assess p erformance i n b 0th h ealth and
education. Special attention will be given to the battle against the spread o f both TB and
HIV/AIDS. The Government will also develop standards to improve the quality o f drinking
water, w i t h a focus o n reform o f municipal service companies. The strengthening o f the c i v i l
society and the judicial system will play a central role in the efforts to enhance citizen
participation and guarantee c i v i l rights.

27.
Objective 4: Environmental Sustainability. Based o n work undertaken internally and in
cooperation with international organizations, including the Bank, the Government i s developing
a National Environmental Strategy. A key objective will be to determine priorities in the context
o f the environmental and other MDGs, and hence to focus on: addressing those environmental
issues that impact negatively o n human health and the living conditions o f the poor (e.g., quality
o f drinking water, industrial pollution);
energy efficiency;
improved natural resource
management; and meeting the key international environmental obligations o f Ukraine. Another
objective will be to create awareness o f the thematic environment issues across all sectors o f the
economy. Overall, emphasis will be given to improving the effectiveness o f the available
resources to meet environmental challenges (following the recommendations o f the
Environmental Expenditure Review), and doing so in a w a y that meets the needs o f the poorest
sections o f the population. With regard to international obligations, the Government will
continue to work with neighboring countries in the preservation and protection o f common
ecosystems. Attention will be given to the implementation o f the Kyoto Protocol, and benefiting
Ukraine o f the opportunities that international agreements provide. With these policies, the
Government expects to reverse the process o f environmental deterioration, reduce the energy
intensity o f the country, control hot spots, and improve the availability o f safe drinking water.
28.
Objective 5 : G radual Integration into t h e World Economic a n d Financial Systems.
The Government has given high priority to becoming a WTO member and i s working to j o i n in
2004. I t would then be possible for Ukraine to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU.
Classification o f Ukraine as a market economy by the U S and the EU should help the country
diversify i t s trade, while continuing to work o n improving trade arrangements with i t s neighbors,
Specific actions would modernize the customs systems and align domestic product standards
with EU practices. Another priority o f Government i s to maintain and adhere to international
standards in combating money laundering, where significant progress has been achieved
recently. The overall objective i s to advance harmonization with EU institutional n o m s .
29.
Objective 6: Reduction of Regional Imbalances. The Government seeks to contain the
regional imbalances that have emerged during the transition. I t plans to develop and implement
a National Regional Development Strategy, based o n strengthening local self-governance. The
strategy will review the impact o f the current system o f fiscal transfers, develop the mechanisms
for investment transfers, and provide a fi-amework to improve business environments at the local
levels. The Government expects to improve the distribution o f income across regions and to
reduce the number o f depressed regions.

16
Objective 7:
Improvement of Transparency, Accountability, and Integrity of
Government. The Government plans to continue ongoing parallel efforts to strengthen the

30.

capacity and accountability o f public actions. Following o n PAL work, priority will be given to
building up the capacity for internal and external control over public expenditure and
strengthening public procurement.
To improve the quality and effectiveness o f public
expenditure, the Government plans to gradually develop a comprehensive Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework. Renewed emphasis will be given to civil service and public
administration reform, seeking foremost to approach EU standards. The efforts to reform the
judicial system will take pride o f place as a critical backbone o f clear and transparent
implementation o f the law.
31.
C i v i l society i s to play a pivotal role both in the oversight o f public expenditures and
public actions, and as generators o f policy ideas. However, mechanisms will have to be
developed to ensure effective consultation o f the policy decisions with c i v i l society, as well as
appropriate feedback mechanisms to evaluate public sector performance.
32.
The Government i s in the process o f deepening democratic institutions to foster a more
open and transparent society and stronger engagements between c i v i l society and Government.
At the same time, the Government i s continuing the process o f economic and other reforms. In
order to build social consensus for sustainable reforms in all sectors; improve transparency and
accountability; and involve c i v i l society, these development processes must be supported by a
coherent and comprehensive communications and outreach program that i s coordinated across
Government agencies, and that incorporates the development o f communications tools and
techniques. There i s also an urgent need to establish a systematic mechanism throughout
Government to develop, coordinate, and disseminate consistent and effective messages o n these
issues to the public. Equally important i s the need to promote a dialogue between the
Government and the c i v i l society through consultation process, two-way communication,
feedback, and involvement in policy-making.
From Objectives to Outcomes to Outputs

33.
As mentioned, the indicators shown in Table 3 along with their baseline values, and
developed in detail in Annex B9, have been developed by the Bank and the Government o f
Ukraine. They can be monitored and are relevant in assessing progress in meeting the objectives
described in the seven areas o f long-term concern.2 W h i l e it i s difficult, based o n current
knowledge, to assign hard targets for all indicators for the relatively short CAS period, tentative
outcomes were agreed, which have the dual purpose o f (i)indicating real change in the
underlying objective, and (iibeing
)
sufficiently ambitious.
34.
Most o f the indicators are not under the direct control o f the Government: rather, they
depend on a complex interaction o f several underlying institutional factors. The Bank and the
Government have thus also agreed o n a set o f intermediate output indicators, largely o f
institutional nature, which are more directly affected by Government action, and which will
create favorable conditions for attaining the outcome indicators shown in Table 3. These
indicators (also shown partially in Table 3 and fully in Annex B9) represent the concrete targets
for the Government’s and Bank’s programs over the four-year CAS period. As will be discussed
later, the extent o f World Bank financial assistance, particularly under the Programmatic

which the Government has adapted t o the Ukrainian situation with the cooperation o f the UNDP and the Bank.

17

Adjustment Lending sequence, will be determined by the degree o f success in attaining these
benchmarks.

35.
The Bank and the Government have agreed to continue to use the methodology
developed under the 200 1-2003 C A S (consisting o f inter-ministerial working groups addressing
cross-sectoral reform issues) for the implementation o f the 2004-2007 CAS. In addition, the
Government has set up a joint monitoring and implementation unit that will review progress in
the indicators o n an annual basis; further, it will use this annual review to agree o n necessary
mid-course corrections to the program. Government’s monitoring and evaluation capacity o f the
above-stated objectives, already increased in the past through the establishment o f nationwide
reliable household surveys, will further be helped by planned improvements in the statistical
services, including W o r l d Bank financing (see below a description o f the STACAP project).

rate over the 2004-2008 period. The k e y factors underlying the scenario are as follows:
0

0

0

Domestic demand growth i s expected to continue, fuelled by increased real household
incomes (especially during the coming presidential campaign) and higher investment
activity (especially from 2005 o n as political risks subside);
The demand growth dynamic will be encouraged by continuing exchange rate and price
stability, which will boost confidence and allow longer-term planning horizons for
businesses and households;
There will be reviving external demand as the world economy recovers, as Ukraine
continues i t s reorientation o f trade to new markets supported by reforms outlined in
paragraph 35 above, and as strong demand f r o m Russia only moderately subsides over
the medium to long term;

19

Continued capacity increases in traditional sectors (e.g., metals, machine building,
chemicals) are expected along with further productivity growth o f the comparative
advantage sectors (e.g. food-processing, textiles, communications, and high technology)
as the business environment improves and investments grow, based in particular, o n the
reforms outlined in paragraph 3 1 above;

A stable macro-environment, prudent monetary policy, and appropriate regulation o f
banks and non-bank financial institutions will further improve the financial sector and
help create new businesses, supported in particular by reforms discussed in paragraph 26
above;
Sound fiscal policy will continue building o n tax reform, expenditure rationalization and
continued improvements in fiduciary management (see paragraphs 26, 30 and 32 above),
which will help to crowd-in private sector lending and support continued monetization o f
the economy.

Financing in Light of the Balance of Payments and Fiscal Balance: Under the Base
Case scenario, the current account surplus will turn to a moderate deficit by 2008. Capital
imports will help feed U-shaped export growth as “new sectors” gain momentum. The current

20
strong transfers f r o m abroad will continue, but at a decreasing rate. The service balance will also
weaken as Ukrainian business and tourists continue to demand more foreign services. Positive
signals from the IFIs, continued macro-growth, and a better business environment will encourage
foreign and domestic investors alike. FDI i s expected to follow an upward trend reaching a
US$1.3 billion i n f l o w in 2008; overall investment will remain at over 20 percent o f GDP
annually. Capital flight will continue to decline on a net basis.

The public sector balance i s projected to return to moderate deficits to finance a gradually
39.
increasing share o f investments and to pay for structural reforms, particularly in the social
sphere. These investments will be partially funded with the help o f W o r l d Bank project loans.
Budget revenues are expected to diminish with the introduction o f lower tax rates, however, this
reduction will be moderate since the tax reform i s also leading to base expansion through the
elimination o f tax exemptions. Over the medium term, revenues are expected to pick up
gradually as more o f the economy registers i t s activities. Moderate deficits plus continued
significant principal repayments o n past borrowing will be financed through a gradual net
increase in domestic financing, privatization proceeds, additional Eurobonds and continued
support from multilateral institutions, particularly EBRD and the W o r l d Bank. Should a
situation arise in which expected financing i s not forthcoming, the Government has already
exhibited the ability to control commitments and revise i t s budgets in order to maintain
macroeconomic stability as a f i r s t priority. Other risks are outlined in paragraphs 107 - 110
below.

WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

OF THE PAST THREEYEARS OF CAS IMPLEMENTATION
A. LESSONS

A CAS Completion Report for the 2001-2003 C A S i s attached to this CAS document.
40.
Important lessons emerging from the report can be summarized as follows:
General
0

The main theme o f the September 2000 C A S focused o n the gap between formal
institutions and informal behaviors as the m a i n reason that development outcomes o f the
f i r s t ten years turned out to be unsatisfactory. The C A S argued the need to stimulate
demand and supply o f pro-development institutions, and to link program implementation
to progress o n the ground in bridging the gap. This orientation was very much in l i n e
with the indications offered earlier by OED’s Country Assistance Evaluation (1999).
Hence, the C A S was conceived as results-oriented: the Base Case was predicated o n
attaining meaningful benchmarks o f institutional improvement, and further Bank
assistance/exposure was also predicated o n continuing progress across-the-board. The
C A S was also very explicit with regard to viewing the relationship between the Bank and
Ukraine as one o f a long-term nature, and to expect that the pace o f implementation o f
reforms would not be linear.

Strengths
0

According to the Report, there i s ample evidence that substantial accomplishments were
obtained in key areas o f structural reform: restoration o f payments discipline in the
energy sector; a budgetary system that i s increasingly rule-driven; better business

21
environment; and beginning o f rationalization o f social expenditures. W h i l e the
relationship between these intermediate outcomes and other welfare-affecting outcomes
(growth, poverty, real wages, educational levels, longevity, etc.). i s non-linear, it can be
argued (as discussed above) that many o f these intermediate outcomes have contributed
to an overall improvement in Ukraine’s socio-economic conditions.
0

0

0

The Report also points to a major strong feature o f Bank-Government interaction during
the past three years: the Bank i s n o w seen as more o f a partner. N o t only were the
principles o f Bank assistance accepted (particularly with regard to reliance o n the
outcome-oriented PAL as the main vehicle for financial support to the budget), but the
programmatic approach has become modus operandi o f Government, or at least with
large sections o f it, where there i s n o w a high degree o f ownership. Perhaps more
importantly, due to ownership, the P A L program has been endorsed and implemented by
all three Governments that have managed Ukraine since the beginning o f the year 2000.
The Report also notes the importance o f IBRD-IFC collaboration and joint work in the
areas o f business environment and private sector development in general.
The emphasis o f the 2000 C A S on developing avenues to facilitate c i v i l society growth
has been positive. Several important experiences have been gained along with the three
directions that were chosen to engage in this relatively new agenda. These were: (i)
designing W o r l d Bank projects to help enhance service delivery and attainment o f
development objectives through involvement o f local communities and C i v i l Society
Organizations (CSOs); (ii)
working, in pilot mode, directly with CSOs and central and
local Governments to increase accountability o f public officials; and (iii)
providing voice
to CSOs to help overcome legislative and regulatory obstacles that impair the growth o f
c i v i l society (including business).

Weaknesses

The Report also points to some weaknesses in the general approach as w e l l as in some
41.
individual initiatives that are o f extreme importance for the CAS.
0

First, problems have continued with the elaboration and implementation o f investment
projects (see B o x 5, Portfolio Performance). Despite recent and substantial revisions in
governmental procedures, further problems have been encountered that have slowed
down normal business practices. This was particularly noticeable in four cases: the Coal
Sector Restructuring Loan; the Sevastopol District Heating Project; the Lviv Water
Supply Project; and the TB/AIDS Project. In addition to these cases several other
problems were encountered at key moments o f project processing such as acceptance o f
invitation to negotiate, post-Board-Approval process, etc. A thorough review o f these
problems suggests the following:
o

The Bank needs to do a better j o b in terms o f understanding the political economy o f
project lending, identifying potential stakeholders, winners and losers; and
incorporating adequate remedies in sector and project strategies to facilitate the
emergence o f coalitions in favor o f the underlying reforms supported by Bank
projects;

22

Box 5. PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE
As of June 30, 2003, the Ukraine portfolio comprises 13 ongoing investment projects totaling US$739.4 million
of which US$600 million i s undisbursed. The average age o f the portfolio i s 2.5 years, ranging from two
projects approved in June 2003 to an Export Development Project in i t s seventh and final year. The portfolio
comprises a balanced m i x o f sectoral composition, encompassing TB/AIDS Control and GEF-supported regional
environment projects, community-based Social Investment Fund, private sector development, infrastructure
(energy and water supply), and strengthening institutions required for sustainable development such as treasury
system and tax administration.
There are currently n o problem projects in the portfolio, although one project (Private Sector Development) i s
classified as “at risk.” O f the 13 projects, four (comprising a total o f US$200 million) have been approved only
in past fiscal year and are not yet effective.
Joint Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) are held on an annual basis with the participation o f the
Bank, Government, and Project Implementing Units (PIUs), to take stock o f portfolio performance and identify
systemic and cross-sectoral issues. For example, the November 2001 CPPR led to the Government’s
introduction o f its “New Procedures for Preparation and Implementation o f Projects Supported by International
Financial Institutions” w i t h the intent to, inter alia: introduce new transparent procedures for managing projects;
link the process o f IF1 project preparation and implementation with the budget process; and establish clear
responsibilities o f participants during project preparation and implementation. The New Procedures have
nonetheless not led to alleviation o f the processing delay issue. At the most recent CPPR (February 2003), the
Bank and the Government agreed to set up a joint Working Group to periodically review implementation issues
o f mutual concern and monitor progress. T w o sub-groups were formed, one to review the overall project
preparation procedures, and another to discuss implementation arrangements, including disbursement matters,
management o f special accounts, and P K J issues. In light o f the persisting processing delays, the Ministry of
Economy i s drafting a proposal on amending domestic project preparation procedures.
Project performance has particularly been affected by delays in loan effectiveness. The Lviv Water Supply
Project, approved in June 2001, was signed after 14 months (in August 2002) and ratified by the Verkhovna
Rada in November 2002. The Private Sector Development Project, approved in March 2002 and signed in
September 2002, became effective in April 2003. In addition, the Sevastopol Heat Supply Improvement Project,
approved in March 2001, and signed on September 23, 2002 expired in January 2003, owing to the City
Council’s failure to secure a majority o f votes to approve the project. Effectiveness delays are inhibiting smooth
project launch and contributing to declining disbursement ratios (8.6% in end-FY03 compared to 16.2% in endFY02). In addition, projects w i t h significant effectiveness delays are known to have a high likelihood of
becoming problem projects.
Delays in project processing after Board approval are particularly pronounced for projects requiring approval of
municipal governments and parliaments. In order to circumvent the problem, future municipal projects should
be addressed through the proposed Municipal Development Fund Project (programmed for FY05) which w i l l
have a separate mechanism o f channeling resources through financial intermediaries under an agreed sub-project
appraisal procedure.

With decentralization, a Procurement Specialist has been posted in the Regional Office in Kyiv, which has
facilitated quick responses and mandatory clearance to queries on procurement matters o n a daily basis.

o

Strategically, the B a n k will n o longer (for the time being) engage in direct lending to
subnational units, but rather will rely o n a single instrument (the proposed Municipal
Development Fund) to foster fiscal accountability and responsiveness at the local
level. Similarly, the Bank has decided to withdraw from further Coal Sector lending
until an agreement is reached with Government and other stakeholders o n the
appropriate directions for coal sector reform;

23
o

0

Discussions with Government also centered o n the nature o f decision-making in the
administration with regard to IF1lending. There i s common agreement that the
revised procedures currently in place are not conducive to reasonably efficient
decision-making, as many reviews are repeated and duplicated at crucial times. A
joint committee has been set up to review options, and i t s recommendations will be
incorporated in the next few months and are part o f the Base Case triggers discussed
below.

In the critical area o f social sector reform, consensus-building took longer than expected,
and therefore the stated objective o f re-directing the lending program towards the social
sectors was met only in part. However, the C A S period was used to increase our
knowledge o f the issues, build consensus, and develop a shared vision that has n o w
resulted in a common action program in key areas such as education, health, pension,
and social assistance reform.
B.

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE
STRATEGY FOR 2004-2007

42.
The Country Assistance Strategy for 2004-2007 builds o n the lessons o f the recent past,
as well as on the appreciation o f the opportunities that will be presented in the future to further
advancement o f reforms in Ukraine (see B o x 6, Mission Statement).
Challenges and Opportunities

43.
The next four-year period in Ukraine will be marked by major events shaping i t s
domestic political and social evolution, as w e l l as i t s positioning in the world. As discussed
above, both internally (through the forthcoming presidential elections and the expected
substantial reshuffling in domestic policies and attitudes towards reform) and externally (through
the new situation presented by the EU enlargement as well as the changed realities in the
international scene) new challenges and opportunities will open for Ukraine over the C A S
period.

44.
The proposed strategy aims to support the European aspiration o f Ukraine by continuing
to facilitate institutional developments that can lead to a business-friendly environment and a
more inclusive and responsive Government. I t will continue to emphasize the need to build the
European aspiration both f r o m the top, through reform o f institutions and policies, and from the
bottom, through the strengthening o f civil society and the consequent increase in accountability
of public officials. The strategy i s results-based it supports the long-term objectives o f the
Government program, and sets clear and monitorable intermediate outputdtargets linked to those
objectives. The amount o f financial assistance, as well as the specific content o f the lending and
non-lending programs, will therefore be linked to the ability o f Government to attain the relevant
benchmarks.
45.
The strategy is also tailored to the realities o f the political cycle in the near and mediumterm. I t recognizes the limited scope for new reform initiatives before the late 2004 elections by
focusing on implementation o f the reforms underway and agreed in the context o f the PAL I1
program, as w e l l as o n activities aimed at increasing voice o f c i v i l society. But following the
presidential elections, the strategy will provide for the possibility o f a high-case lending scenario,
based on Ukraine’s ability to seize the reform momentum and accomplish substantial advances
in Energy, Financial Sector, and Social Sector reform.

Box 6. CAS MISSION
STATEMENT

This i s the Mission Statement for the Bank’s strategy in Ukraine for 2004-2007:
To assist Ukraine in building institutions necessary for sustainable and equitable growth and
for poverty reduction. To support Ukraine’s aspirations with regard to increasing integration
with the EU and with the WTO. To help provide Ukraine’s citizenry greater voice and to foster
stronger accountability of government.

Results Orientation and Programmatic Assistance

47.
The C A S i s geared to maximizing the impact o f Government and Bank resources in
meeting the intermediate objectives agreed to in the “Results Framework.” Hence, in designing
the assistance program, both on the lending and non-lending side, the following considerations
have been taken into account:
0

New lending and non-lending operations will support a cross-sectoral program to
improve the functioning o f market institutions. The main vehicle for direct budgetary
support will remain the Programmatic Adjustment Loan sequence, geared towards
supporting the Government program in the attainment o f meaningful institutional
benchmarks required to attain the objectives described above. The PAL will continue to
financial discipline;
underscore improvements in five thematic, cross-cutting areas: (i)
(ii)
property rights; (iii)
strengthening and simplification o f the regulatory framework;
(iv) management o f public resources; and (v) social and environmental sustainability.
The benchmarks around which the PAL sequence will be built are those selected by
Government and Bank as output indicators in the framework for results (Table 3 and
Annex B9).

Investment projects and non-lending operations will address institutional bottlenecks and
capacity building in areas that are important for the attainment o f the Government
objectives discussed above, and will reflect the Bank’s comparative advantages.
Non-lending activities will be increasingly geared to improvements in capacity, and will
be conducted in collaborative fashion with Ukrainian Government and institutions,
maximizing the synergies with other donors’ initiatives (see Partnerships and Selectivity
section, para 90).
W o r l d Bank activities geared towards empowerment o f c i v i l society (see B o x 7, World
Bank CAS and Civil Society) will continue as an important mainstay o f the strategy,
recognizing the importance o f the growth o f c i v i l society in ensuring that institutions are
more responsive to the requirements o f a market-based, inclusive society, and that
Government accountability i s strengthened at a l l levels.

48.
Lending Envelope and Results. Given the results-based nature o f the lending program, it
i s to be expected that the amount o f lending will depend on the Government’s success in
attaining the objectives just discussed, as w e l l as in improving i t s o w n capacity t o process and
implement Bank loans. Under the Base Case, total new IBRD commitments are expected to fall
within the range o f US$1.8-2.4 billion over the FY04-07 period (Table 5, Proposed Indicative
Lending Scenarios, 2004-2007). Budgetary support will be provided in the form o f a series o f

25
single-tranche Programmatic Adjustment Loans (a US$250 m i l l i o n operation in F Y 0 4 and up to
three US$300 million-each operations, FY05, 06, 07) linked to the attainment o f relevant
benchmarks o f progress. As in the past, the PALs, although timed roughly at a yearly interval,
will be disbursed only when the relevant benchmarks will be met, and hence not all the P A L s
may be disbursed. The lower range mentioned above assumes that only 2 o f the 4 PALs would
be presented to the Board during the C A S period, consistent with prior experience. In this
respect, access to budgetavy support $-om the Bank w i l l be dependent entirely on performance
and realization of results.

49.

Based o n the medium-term macroeconomic projections discussed in section 2, the
Ukraine Government has indicated that it would like to increase i t s borrowing envelope from the
Bank in order to facilitate orderly refinancing o f debt obligations coming due over the next few
years. W h i l e as mentioned Ukraine has access to Eurobond markets, the terms o f access are less
favorable than Bank financing, with short maturities and higher spreads. Further Bank lending
would lessen the impact o f external debt servicing on the budget, thus freeing resources required
by several reform initiatives. On the other hand, the ability o f Ukraine to absorb W o r l d Bank
resources in the past three years has been inferior to expectations, particularly in view o f the
longer time required to reach the benchmarks underlying the P A L sequence, and the continuing
complexities in the procedures for approval o f investment projects.
50.
In view o f these considerations, this CAS includes a possible High Case, which would be
linked to accelerated realization o f agreed benchmarks, as well as substantial streamlining in
Government procedures. In view o f the political calendar discussed above, it i s to be expected
that such High Case might be obtained after the next presidential elections in early CY05. The
lending envelope for the High Case could thus rise to US$3.0 billion. The High Case would be
discussed in detail in a C A S Update, to be presented to the Board in early FY06.
5 1.
Under the Low Case which could be precipitated by several factors discussed in the Risk
section, not only would progress in institutional reform slow down to the point o f making it
unlikely that the objectives underlying this C A S would be met, but also possible backtracking in
critical areas (e.g., energy, tax policy and administration, expenditure policy) might threaten the
macroeconomic framework. Under these circumstances, IBRD lending would be substantially
curtailed, and would be limited to those areas where policy dialogue would not be compromised
by the unfavorable overall conditions. IBRD net exposure would not increase.
Program Content and Objectives

52.
During C A S implementation, the first priority will be given to the full implementation o f
ongoing programs, particularly a number o f those that have become effective only recently. O f
these, the Social Investment Fund, the TB/AIDS Control Project, the Private Sector
Development Project, the First State Tax Service Modernization Program, the L a n d Titling and
Cadastre, and the E-Development projects are expected to yield substantial improvements in key
areas o f reform and to contribute to increased social cohesion.
Lending and non-lending support will be targeted to institutional improvements that will
53.
facilitate attaining the objectives discussed above. As the Government Program objectives cover
a wide range o f issues, the Bank assistance will selectively focus o n activities that will meet one
or more o f these three tests (already developed during the C A S 2000-2003 period): (a) providing
greater voice to society and stimulating the accountability o f government; (b) providing

26
appropriate incentives for improvement o f institutions, complementary to reforms supported
under P A L ; or (c) addressing global public goods concerns. The PAL series will continue to play
a pivotal role in supporting attainment o f assistance objectives, while individual investment and
TA projects m a y address issues that are common to several objectives. Program details classified
by Government Program objective are as follows:

Objective 1. Sustainable Economic Growth
Nun-lending Activities. The C A S program includes a number o f non-lending activities
54.
to help ensure sustainable economic growth, with particular emphasis o n the environment for
private sector development. In addition to the C E M n o w under way, the CAS proposes to
produce in late C Y 0 4 a series o f just-in-time policy notes, touching on all major subjects o f
policy reform that could serve as important input into the new administration’s thinking,
following the forthcoming presidential elections.
55.
Fiduciary ESW (PER, CFFA, Poverty Assessment and CPAR) will be updated over the
C A S cycle, ensuring in particular that it i s connected with the implementation o f the reforms
spurred by the earlier cycle, and n o w being part o f specific action plans.

With regard to the remaining important agenda in the Energy Sector, an Energy Sector
56.
Policy Note, complementing the recently finished Coal Sector Study, will provide the platform
for discussion o f remaining energy issues. A planned Knowledge Economy Assessment (FY05)
would help review major constraints in Ukraine’s taking full advantage o f opportunities in the
global knowledge economy.
As detailed below, the program o f technical assistance o f the I F C will continue to provide
57.
expertise and greater voice to the business community, particularly SMEs. This will be
complemented by the implementation o f the Private Sector Development project, whose secondphase A P L i s expected to take place during the C A S period.
Lending Activities. The P A L series i s expected to continue helping the government set
58.
the institutional basis for sustained economic growth, with a focus o n enhanced financial
discipline, an improved business environment, stronger financial sector regulation, and
implementation o f the new privatization program. Moreover, a group o f proposed projects will
help implement important institutional reforms in key areas by providing resources for increased
investments. Investments in Infrastructure will capitalize o n the lessons o f the past, and w i l l go
pari passu with improvements in the underlying institutional environment, as well as the division
o f labor with other IFIs discussed in the Partnership and Selectivity section. The Municipal
Development L o a n (FY05, APL totaling US$250 million) will help increase fiscal discipline and
capacity at city level. The Energy Reform APL (FY05, APL, US$250 million) will help
consolidate reforms in the several areas o f the Energy Sector (power, coal, gas), and will be
tailored to match the speed o f progress in the different areas. T w o pilot projects would address
more directly the challenges o f increased integration in the European space. The Rural Finance
and Development o f Long-term Credit Project (FY04, A P L totaling US$250 million) builds o n
the improvements to creditor rights that have been recently enacted by the Ukrainian legislature,
and will aim to jump-start the long-term credit marked by fostering the emergence o f private,
market-based second-tier intermediaries. While centered on the provision o f long-term credit to
agriculture, the project will more generally help the emergence o f long-term credit to all sectors
o f the economy. The proposed follow-up to the E-Development LIL recently approved would

27
capitalize o n the experience gained therein, and provide incentives and financing for Ukrainian
industry and services to fully exploit the potential for advances in the knowledge economy.
Finally, depending on the evolution o f ongoing policy dialogue, the Bank will also consider an
intervention either in the Judicial Sector, or in a follow-up to the Treasury Modernization project
n o w nearing completion (FY06).

Objective 2. Poverty Reduction and Strengthening of the Middle Class
59.
In addition to the policy dialogue to be pursued under the PAL sequence, the Bank
program will provide non-lending and lending support for poverty reduction and strengthening o f
the middle class. Non-lending activities have played a key role in fostering the institutional
reform agenda for poverty reduction. Programs aimed at facilitating Growth o f C i v i l Society
have taken an important role, as empowerment o f communities i s a key element in effective
poverty reduction. As discussed in the CAS Completion Report, such programs have evolved
providing voice to civil society; (ii)
working directly with civil society on
along three lines: (i)
selected initiatives with high demonstrative value; and (iii)using Bank projects to pilot
alternative forms of service delivery at the local level. During the next C A S period, these three
lines o f w o r k will remain the main strategic direction for Bank activities. Specifically, the
People’s Voice program will enter i t s second phase, when the methodologies tested in the threeyear period just ended will be extended. People’s Voice Program Phase I1 will scale up to six
new cities the Phase Iactivities, which are designed to implement mechanisms and procedures
that promote public participation in building an effective, responsible and open Government at
the municipal level throughout Ukraine.
60.
A Poverty Assessment (FY05), together with the results o f the ongoing CEM, i s expected
to provide further indications o n the determinants o f the persistence o f poverty that have been
observed in the past few years, and to help in the design o f appropriate policies. In addition, a
Labor Market survey will provide indications regarding the obstacles to growth o f employment
in the private sector that derive from outdated legislation and regulation, and uneven application
thereof.

Lending Activities. The PAL series will continue to support improvements in the
61.
streamlining and targeting o f social assistance, the reform and sustainability o f the pension
system, and reducing the tax burden o n labor. Additionally, on the basis o f the indications that
already emerged with respect to the features o f poverty in Ukraine, and following up o n the
implementation of the ongoing and proposed projects that will help consolidate the framework
for rural and agricultural activities, a Development o f the Rural Economy (FY06, U S $ l 5 0
million) project i s expected to focus o n alleviation o f poverty in the rural areas. The project will
complement the activities of the ongoing Social Investment Fund, and will concentrate on the
creation o f a suitable environment for the growth o f j o b opportunities in the rural areas.
62.
The Social Protection Administration Efficiency Reform project (FYOS, US$50 million)
will help implement the reform o f social benefits, emphasizing targeting and quality o f service,
and supporting the PAL agenda. Additionally, the Government has also requested a Pension
Reform Implementation L o a n (FY06, U S $ 100 million), which would help implement record
tracking and management in the social security administration, and contribute to the success of
the ongoing pension reform. Finally, the Development o f the State Statistics System for
Monitoring of the Social and Economic Transformation project (FY04, US$30 million) will help
improve the monitoring infrastructure o f the country, increase accuracy o f social indicators, and

28

BOX 7. WORLD BANKCAS AND CIVIL SOCIETY

The 2000-2003 C A S stressed the importance o f support for civil society as part o f building demand for
institutions. The Bank pursued this objective through three avenues: (i)direct projects w i t h civil society; (ii)
cooperation w i t h c i v i l society in design and implementation o f Bank projects; and (iii)the promotion o f a larger
role for civil society.
Direct Projects. Direct programs during this CAS period have included: the creation o f an N G O contact
the
continuation o f the People’s Voice project; the setting up o f the Institutional Development Fund
group;
(Dialogue for Reforms); organizing the innovation day andknowledge forum; publishing and distributing an
N G O bulletin; and, a small grants program. The N G O contact group, established in the fall o f 2000, has helped
guide the Bank’s civil society agenda, Participants have found an open forum where they could consider a broad
range of issues, including the mission o f the group, strategies to strengthen civil society, tax treatment o f NGOs,
the role of the Bank in civil society issues in Ukraine, etc. The Ministry o f Economy i s considering establishing a
C i v i l Society Advisory Group patterned on the NGO contact group. The NGO contact group now considers how
to redefine i t s mission as the scope o f civil society activities increases. The People’s Voice Project i s a pioneer
program o f civil society involvement in Ukraine and in the region. The pilot phase (financed by C I D A and
administered by the Bank) operated in four cities and has now been completed. A follow-up project i s expected to
cover 6 new cities. A thorough evaluation o f the project effectiveness will take place in 2003. The experience has
served to enrich implementation o f the Social Investment Fund (FY02). There i s also great synergy with the
Institutional Development Fund (dialogue for reforms), a project financed with IDF resources and managed by the
Ministry o f the Economy. The IDF supports Government commitment to consult reform initiatives, obtain
feedback, and involve civil society actors in the execution and monitoring o f public programs. Already, several
initiatives have been supported to monitor program implementation at the local level.
Civil Society and Bank Projects. The Bank has also sought to involve c i v i l society in the design and
implementation o f individual projects, most notably the Social Investment Fund, the Private Sector Development
program, and the TBIAIDS prevention program. Several elements o f civic engagement have been internalized in
the project cycle and a number o f initiatives have brought good results. A number o f indications emerged:
(a) Civic engagement i s most successful when it i s driven by the project’s development objectives and i s
an intrinsic part o f project activities;

(b) Whether the indicator to be monitored consists o f community satisfaction w i t h community and social
care services; consumer satisfaction with water services and tariff level; or the quality o f health care, participatory
monitoring clearly emerges as a way o f intensifying civic engagement that can strengthen all o f the reviewed
projects;
(c) While the basic principle o f participatory monitoring i s that primary stakeholders are active articipants
and not just sources of information, i t also builds the local capacity for analysis. Moreover, it contributes to better
govemance by increasing autonomy, self-organization and voice; improving effectiveness o f service delivery
institutions and outcomes; producing more relevant and reliable information; and importantly, increasing
accountability and transparency;

(d) When projects face limited cooperation and commitment from administrations responsible for
implementing particular sectoral reforms, an ongoing analysis o f the (local/ national) political economy should be
backed by an alliance w i t h c i v i l society to push for reform.
The Broader Agenda. A recent review o f World Bank activities shows the WB i s seen as an important
mediator for civil society to communicate with the Government as well as a vital coordinator and an information
source. Also, the World Bank i s seen as an important builder o f symbolic and institutional infrastructure for
information sharing, consultation, and cooperation between public, private, and third sectors. In the future, it w i l l
be necessary to see how the Bank can best contribute to the development o f stable consultation mechanisms
amongst the Government, the Rada, and civil society, and to improving the legal framework for civil society
activities.
The Public Perception. Despite important achievements, there i s limited awareness o f the WB
involvement in civil society activities from others than those directly involved, There is also the perception of
considerable overlapping among the activities and initiatives o f the various donor agencies and a greater degree of
coordination i s called for. Some see the Bank playing the role o f coordinator.

Objective 3. Harmonized Human Development

63.
The PAL series will support the implementation o f the Health and Education strategies
that were developed during the previous CAS period. In addition to the mentioned
implementation o f the T B I A I D S project, the Bank will offer a number o f initiatives aimed at
improved educational and health outcomes. The Equal Access to Quality Education project
(FY05, US$SO million) will contribute to a reallocation o f resources within the Education Sector,
providing for rationalization o f unused facilities, while improving the access to modern
technologies for all students. Depending o n the results o f the ongoing policy dialogue, a Health
Reform project (FY07, US$lOO million) may materialize during the C A S period, addressing the
requirements for rationalization o f the sector, o f strengthening o f primary health care, and more
stable forms o f financing. The already-mentioned Poverty Assessment will provide insights with
regard to access to services, and will feed into the t w o lending operations.

30
Objective 4. Protection of Natural Environment.
64.
The PAL series will pay particular attention to monitoring the implementation o f the
environment legislation in the country and will assist the country in depending appropiate
instruments to follow-up implementation. The productive environmental dialogue fostered in the
past three years, together with the implementation o f new government policies in support o f the
environment, w i l l lay the foundations for the Environmental Institutional Strengthening project
(FY06, US$50 million), which i s key to the implementation o f the National Environment
Strategy. The environment will also benefit from the Energy APL (already discussed), which
will reduce harmful air emissions and increase energy efficiency. In l i n e with outcomes o f Kyiv
2003 Ministerial Conference (Carpathian Convention and Dnipro Declaration signed by
Ukraine), development o f national water resource strategy and forestry standards and strategy
will result in improved management o f these resources.
65.
A number o f GEF activities are also contemplated. In the area o f Wetland and Coastal
Zone Management, the Biodiversity Conservation in the Azov-Black Sea Ecological Corridor
project applies a landscape approach to sustainable management o f coastal resources, which are
threatened by unsustainable land use practices by untreated sewage and solid waste, especially in
tourist-related areas such as Crimea. The proposed Crimea Coastal Zone Management and
Nutrient Reduction project (GEF) would build o n this approach by supporting wastewater
treatment and improved land use planning in the Crimea and Black Sea region. This project
would also contribute to nutrient reduction in the Black Sea. The proposed Methyl Bromide
Production Phaseout Project will expand the GEF activities in the area o f implementation o f the
Montreal Protocol o n Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
66.
Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). Ukraine has a very large potential to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. Provided institutional and regulatory establishment i s conducive for applying the
flexible mechanisms under the K y o t o Protocol and respective financing instruments, it i s
estimated that Ukraine could have access to substantial financing during the f i r s t commitment
period (2008-20 12). The recently completed Ukraine National Strategy Study for the Reduction
o f Greenhouse Gas Emissions came to the conclusion that Ukraine has to step up i t s efforts to
become familiar with the Kyoto mechanisms to be able to use it effectively.

Objective 5. Gradual Integration into the World Economic and Financial Systems.
67,
PAL, as in the past C A S period, will accompany the government in its effort to prepare
itself for W T O membership. In addition to continuing to provide assistance to the Government
on matters involving WTO accession and the definition o f a new partnership with the enlarged
EU, the Bank will develop, together with other partners, a Pilot European Regional Integration
project (FY07, US$40 million). The aim o f the project will be to facilitate closer relationships o f
border areas under the new EU partnerships.

Objective 6. Reduction of Regional Imbalances
68.
The PAL series will continue its support to Ukraine in improving the mechanisms for
fiscal transfers between levels o f governments and enhancing the revenue generation capacity o f
local governments. Additionally, the Bank has started a dialogue o n issues o f regional
development, and has provided the Government with access to knowledge regarding European
and non-European approaches to market-friendly mitigation o f regional imbalances that often
accompany the process o f economic restructuring. This dialogue will be continued, both through

the ESW already discussed (CEM, Policy Notes) and through project preparation o f the Rural
Finance, Rural Development and Municipal Development L o a n projects.
Objective 7. Improvement of Transparency, Accountability and Integrity of Government.

69.
The PAL series will build up on achievements during the last C A S to improve the
transparency, accountability and integrity o f government. Emphasis will be given to the
development o f a system o f internal and external control along the lines o f EU directives.
Moreover, the B a n k will pursue a program o f facilitation o f voice o f the citizenry and facilitation
of required reorganization at the top. As discussed above, the People’s Voice project, phase 11,
will provide more opportunities for increased accountability o f government at the local. level. In
addition, the Dialogue for Reforms project (IDF) has made significant progress towards
expanding the dialogue between the Government and c i v i l society. This project could be scaled
up into a comprehensive program that reviews overall Government communications,
incorporates development o f communications as a critical element o f the reform agenda, and i s
coordinated across Government agencies and provides for public participation at all levels o f
decision-making. Options will be developed following an assessment o f current experiences.
The Bank i s also currently conducting a study o f Public Administration Reform issues,
70.
which i s expected to provide a baseline assessment o f c i v i l service, as well as a platform for
discussions o n priorities for reform, realistically to be tackled by the new Presidential
administration. The Bank has also worked with a number o f government agencies that have
begun their o w n reform and reorganization. As mentioned above, the implementation o f the
STSMP program will contribute to substantial restructuring and change in mission o f one o f the
most important and controversial agencies, the State Tax Administration. In addition, depending
o n the evolution o f the sector dialogue, the Bank program may contemplate a follow-up initiative
to the ongoing Treasury Modernization Project, and/or support to the reform o f the Ministry o f
Justice, in coordination with other donors already active in this area (see below). Operation may
also include assistance to the Government in improving capacity to deal with the IFIs and better
coordination o f the donor community programs.
Triggers and Lending Scenarios

71.
Ukraine i s presently in the Base Case o f the 2000 CAS. For the period 2004-2007, three
assistance scenarios are considered, Base, Low, and High. The triggers are illustrated in Table 6,
Triggers and Lending Levels.
72.
The Base Case assumes advances in structural reforms along the l i n e o f the PAL
program. In particular, the PAL triggers regarding the implementation o f the M o U for
rehabilitation o f the Savings Bank, the implementation o f the Action Plan to impose financial
discipline and to bring energy companies to financial solvency, and the implementation o f the
government’s White Paper o n internal financial control, will be the key benchmarks for
continued Base Case assistance. In relation to the L o w Case, the Base Case assumes: (i)
a
higher and more sustainable growth path; (ii)
lower fragility o f the economic system to shocks;
(iii)lower contingent liabilities, more financial intermediation, and reduced borrowing costs;
(iv) higher domestic and foreign investment; and (v) more inclusive economic growth, which i s
shared more broadly across the population. The Base Case would thus lead to lower poverty, an
emerging middle class, and less regional disparities than the L o w Case. B o t h cases assume no
IMF disbursements. In the Base Case a Precautionary Stand-By i s assumed to be in place, at

32
maintenance o f an appropriate
least for part o f the period. Specific triggers would be: (i)
macroeconomic framework; (ii)
satisfactory implementation o f the M o U for rehabilitation o f the
Savings Bank, the implementation o f the Action Plan to impose financial discipline and to bring
energy companies to financial solvency, and the implementation o f the government’s White
continued satisfactory progress in implementation o f the
Paper on intemal financial control; (iii)
agreed portfolio improvement plan, and (iv) strict adherence to fiduciary obligations. Under the
Base Case, Ukraine could borrow up to US$2.4 billion over the four-year period, with roughly
50 percent provided in the form o f direct budgetary support through annual PAL operations, and
the rest in the form o f investment loans meeting the criteria discussed above.

The Low Case would be precipitated by a return to macroeconomic instability o n
73.
account o f unsupportive macroeconomic policies, andor reversed reform in key structural areas
supported under previous PALs. Under this scenario, new commitments would be limited to a
maximum o f US$710 million, if a Low Case scenario were to be obtained for the entire four-year
period, Bank exposure would slightly decrease during the period.
74.

The High Case would be obtained if Ukraine were able, in addition to meeting the

be able to borrow up to US$200 milliodyear in addition to the Base Case borrowing levels,
bringing the total envelope to US$3 billion.
International Finance Corporation Strategy

75.
IFC currently has a small portfolio o f US$15.5 million (US$3.5 m i l l i o n loan, US$12
m i l l i o n equity) reflecting the difficult business environment and l o w private investor interest in
Ukraine in the past. However, I F C i s responding to recent improvements in economic
management and legislation by stepping up i t s business development efforts, with an increasing
focus on local companies both in Real and Financial Sectors. In addition, I F C i s continuing i t s
large and very effective Technical Assistance program, which has been directed to improve the
business environment, as w e l l as to provide hands-on support to small and medium enterprises
and farms.
76.
I F C has increased i t s efforts to identify Ukrainian companies with solid projects and
transparent practices, with a view to helping their efforts to adopt modern production and
management techniques, improve corporate governance, and gain credibility, as w e l l as provide
financial support for their projects. In working with foreign investors, IFC provides additional
value by helping to build local supply chains as well as by providing corporate governance
training and consulting to investment clients.

77.
IFC’s business promotion efforts are focusing on agribusiness and metalworking; mineral
resources; transport equipment and infrastructure; and financial services. IFC recently concluded
a partial credit guarantee scheme to serve small and medium size borrowers, and i s in the process
of approving a loan to a leasing company to ease the constraints o n SME financing.
78.
Agribusiness, Manufacturing, Services. One o f the key sectors for IFC in Ukraine will be
integrated agribusiness, where I F C will actively pursue investment opportunities in poultry,
edible oils, fruit and vegetable processing, as well as supply infrastructure (e.g., grain terminals,
warehousing, logistic services). IFC i s also interested in helping the rationalization o f the
metallurgical production capacity through the modernization o f downstream metal products
industry. Based o n i t s experience in the other F S U countries, IFC expects financing needs to
emerge in the modernization o f Ukraine’s retail trade and business tourism sectors by
experienced international companies as w e l l as emerging local companies that are increasingly
focused on modern business practices.
79.
Mineral Resources. I F C will have selective engagements in cross-border transactions in
hydrocarbons, and will follow opportunities in divestments o f o i l service companies and with
international o i l services companies. The Gas Sector may present more opportunities for IFC
once it i s deregulated. IFC opportunities in the area o f mining hinge o n the deregulation and the
emergence o f private sector players in these sectors. I F C will focus o n understanding the
market, identifying the key players and selected international junior mining companies, and seek
to finance their environmentally sound projects.

34
Infrastructure and Utilities. In the power and gas distribution sectors, IFC’s active
80.
participation depends o n effective privatization and the introduction o f measures to eliminate
theft and enforce payments discipline. In the Telecom Sector, IFC’s focus will be o n mobile
communications expansion. Liberalization o f fixed operators may also lead to investment
opportunities where IFC may participate. In infrastructure, IFC will look at selective
opportunities with both movable and immovable properties, focusing on logistics, ports and
watedsewage systems once the sector i s privatized. In the I T sector, I F C will provide small
equity financing alongside other foreign and local equity groups to Ukrainian technology
companies.
Financial Sector. The Financial Sector’s role has recently increased and I F C has
resumed i t s efforts to work with local banks o n introducing new products and services, as w e l l as
develop non-bank financial institutions like leasing companies and insurance. In focus are
housing finance and various new financial instruments (such as partial guarantees) that would
allow banks to extend maturities and reach more clients. IFC i s also expanding i t s support for
SMEs through the promotion o f the leasing industry by helping with the preparation o f a new
Leasing L a w and amendments to the tax legislation, as w e l l as providing training and consulting
o n leasing know-how to local leasing companies and their clients, financial institutions, and
Government officials.

81.

I F C Advisory Work

82.
I F C has mounted a major technical assistance operation in Ukraine during the last
decade, and mobilized close to US$38 m i l l i o n in donor funding. Currently IFC i s implementing
four TA projects in the country:

the Corporate Development project, in which the main goal i s to help local companies
become more attractive to investment through improved corporate governance and
financial management;
the Agribusiness Development project, aimed to improve the supply chains and facilitate
farmers’ access to financing;

the S M E Electronic Toolkit project, which i s piloting an internet portal designed to
increase SMEs’ access to financing, and the annual S M E survey, which I F C has
conducted since 1996;
support to the Parliament on the new draft L a w o n Leasing, which i s pending passage in
the Ukrainian legislature.

I F C i s also contributing through its TA activities to the program o f work o n regulatory
83.
reform and the protection o f property rights.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Activities

84.
MIGA has facilitated estimated foreign direct investment o f US$70 m i l l i o n into Ukraine
to date. MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Ukraine consists o f one contract o f guarantee in the
Financial Sector with a total gross exposure o f US$19 million. Currently, MIGA has t w o
expressions o f interest for projects in manufacturing for a total o f US$8.9 million. When
promoting itself as a destination for foreign direct investment, Ukraine can also benefit from

35
access to MIGA’s online investor information services, which provide a vehicle for
disseminating i n f o m a t i o n o n the investment climate and business opportunities in the country.
Partnerships and Selectivity

85.
Tighter cooperation and coordination o f the Bank’s activities with other IFIs and our
donor partners will become even more critical as the C A S aims at achieving concrete results.
During C A S preparation the draft strategy has been discussed with all interested partners, with a
view to increasing the Bank’s policy leverage, as well as to avoid duplication o f efforts.
86.
Cooperation with the IMF i s strong. At the policy level, both institutions have made an
effort to operate within clearly defined rules: with the Bank concentrating o n structural issues in
key sectors (energy sector, financial sector) while at the same time relying largely on the IMF for
macro monitoring in Ukraine. Continuation o f this practice will help avoid duplication and
overlapping which levied an additional burden o n the client country (i.e. PAL and PAL I1
programs). The recently completed joint Bank/IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program
should allow the stakeholders to develop a strategy that fosters future institutional development
and monitors extemal risks to this sector. The Bank and the IMF have in addition collaborated
o n a number o f areas o f technical assistance (notably Treasury development, tax policy and
administration reform, statistics), and this collaboration i s expected to continue in the future.

87.

M o s t major bilateral and multilateral donors have adopted medium to long-term
strategies or frameworks for their presence in Ukraine (EBRD, EU-TACIS, UNDP, ILO, as w e l l
as bilateral donors, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Germany, the
Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, and Switzerland). Additionally, trust fund support o f both the
Netherlands and Japan i s often formally integrated within the Bank’s operations. Annex B9,
column “Bank and Partner interventions in the thematic area” contains an overview o f the donor
activities in Ukraine in the thematic areas and possible synergies with the C A S objectives.
88.
With regard to the European Union, the newly adopted strategic document, “Wider
Europe - Neighborhood: A New Framework for Relations with EU’s Eastern and Southem
Neighbors,” envisages establishing specific Action Plans, drawing together existing and future
w o r k in the full range o f the EU relations with Ukraine and other countries, in order to set out
clearly the over-arching strategic policy targets and benchmarks by which progress can be
judged. The latter might be complemented by more detailed “National Action Plans,” which
would address political reforms (rule o f law; good governance; respect o f human rights and
minorities, etc.), trade and economic reforms (these will be closely linked with related W o r l d
Bank and IMF programs), and “common cross border challenges” (i.e. HIV-AIDS).
89.
The EU i s also considering a possibility o f extension o f the European Investment Bank
(EIB) lending to Ukraine to support infrastructure development. Over the C A S period, the Bank
will work to facilitate the operationalization o f the “Wider Europe” concept, and will review the
areas in which complementarities might emerge. In addition, the Bank will continue to w o r k
with the National T A C I S program and the TA opportunities i t offers. Through a wide range o f
activities the EU has provided the W o r l d Bank Group with additional leverage in the areas o f
institutional, legal and administrative reform, Private Sector development, and Social Sector
reforms.

The Bank will also continue relying o n the cooperation with the Netherlands in
90.
improving financial accountability and procurement reform o f the Ukrainian Government,

36
Financial Sector development, and WTO accession - all o f which are important elements o f the
PAL programs.

9 1.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will take the lead in
mobilizing s t i l l reluctant FDI much needed for the sustainable economic growth. The
programmatic lending o f the W o r l d Bank will benefit from the EBRD interventions aimed at
commercialization o f the Public Sector, the stimulation o f further key privatizations, continued
high profile support for private business and Banking Sector, and improving energy efficiency
and nuclear safety.
92.
The UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) has made valuable input
into the discussions o n the political framework for poverty reduction, which was fed into the
CAS program. The B a n k has benefited from the extensive analytical work commissioned by
DFID and done by the London School o f Economics o n identifying the poverty profile in
Ukraine. The Bank will also continue to work with DFID in the areas o f administrative reform
(especially at the municipal level) and social development o f the regions.
93.
The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has chosen to focus i t s
activities in Ukraine in the area o f governance, working both top-down (governance structures
and institutional capacity) and bottom-up (strengthening c i v i l society), and along axes o f policymaking and the r u l e o f law. The Canadian resources will continue to comprise the core o f the
very successful People’s Voice Project, already discussed.
94.
The Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) has been working closely with
the Bank in providing expertise and advice for the process o f land privatization, land surveys and
registration, as well as in the area o f procurement reform. In the coming years, the Bank Group
will seize the opportunity for cooperation with S I D A in the areas o f socially sustainable
economic transition, enterprise development, administrative reform, and environmentally
sustainable development.
95.
The W o r l d Bank and the U S Agency for International Development (USAID) will be
working in a number o f common areas. Under the U S A I D Country Strategic Plan for 2003improvement o f the
2007, USAID will be pursuing five strategic objectives in Ukraine: (i)
investment climate; (ii)growth o f the SMEs and agriculture; (iii)democratization and
promotion o f citizens’ rights; (iv) increasing effectiveness o f the Government institutions; and
(v) improvement o f the social conditions and health. These areas are o f a definite comparative
advantage o f the Agency that the Bank would like to capitalize upon in the design and
implementation o f the programs o f public administration reform, strengthening o f the regulatory
and judicial bodies, anti-corruption work, and promoting public-private dialogue.
96.
I t should be noted that practically all donors assisted the Bank in i t s efforts to promote
civil society involvement in the C A S formulation and implementation, and provided expertise
and resources for broader public outreach.
97.
Finally, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has been instrumental in
helping the Government elaborate the Millennium Development Goals fitted to the Ukrainian
context, which as discussed, underlies the results-based nature o f the CAS. The UNDP will
continue to be a major partner o f the Bank in helping Ukraine t o reach the country specific
MDGs. Additional efforts will be needed to attain a genuine cooperation with the UN Agencies
to reduce the proliferation and duplication o f the donor-funded programs around MDGs.

c.

CREDITWORTHINESS AND R I S K S

Ukraine’s Creditworthiness
98.
Ukraine has improved i t s creditworthiness since the financial crisis o f the late 90’s
through a rebound o f economic activity, good monetary policy, responsible fiscal management
and debt restructuring. As o f July 2003, Ukraine’s sovereign debt i s rated in the B range by the
leading rating a g e n ~ i e s . ~The Ministry o f Finance organized a series o f debt restructuring
agreements in 1999 and 2000 which significantly improved Ukraine’s liquidity and debt
sustainability o ~ t l o o k .The
~ fiscal policy implemented since 1999 has allowed the M o F to keep
domestic debt issuance at about the level o f T-bill amortization. Along with continued economic
growth, this has contributed to reduced debt and smoothed debt service ratios. In 1999, public
and publicly guaranteed debt (PPG) topped 61 percent o f GDP and external PPG debt reached 50
percent o f GDP. These figures have fallen to 34.3 and 24.6 percent, respectively, through 2002.
Meanwhile, in the context o f growing money demand, large current account surpluses continue
to provide foreign exchange through non-sterilized purchases without depreciating the domestic
currency. Reserves n o w cover over 3 months o f imports, compared to 3 weeks o f imports in
1999. Further stabilization continues to come from the noted diversification o f export markets,
in particular to European and Asian markets. The rating agencies note political uncertainty and
the need to continue the process o f institutional and structural reform as the keys to improving
Ukraine’s future creditworthiness.
99.
Given the estimated 5 percent average real GDP growth, slow real appreciation o f the
currency with larger productivity improvements, a few more years o f current account surpluses
and continued fiscal restraint, the debt ratios are projected to decline to 19 and 12 percent o f
GDP over the forecast period. With regard to the IFI’s share o f the debt portfolio, preferred
creditor debt to total debt i s 73 percent (See Table 4 and Annex B7). Preferred debt service to
total debt service i s currently 43.8 percent and i s projected to be 62.7 percent in 2008. While this
i s above the guideline o f 35%, this i s because Ukraine’s debt to GDP ratio i s modest overall and
as noted above (paragraph 107), Ukraine has recently concluded a comprehensive debt
restructuring which has reduced debt service o f non-preferred creditors substantially. In this
context, IBRD debt service to Preferred Creditor debt service is currently 32.1 percent and is
projected to be 46.1 percent in 2008. Contingent liabilities have also been reduced significantly
and/or programmed into financial projections in recent years through the recognition and
restructuring o f energy sector debts to Russia, refusal to bear the burden o f unguaranteed
municipal debt @e., Odesa bonds), recognition o f the debt service requirements o f external
guarantees issued in the early 90’s (which are called at a high rate), and good progress o n
pension reform. Ukraine will face some US$0.9 b i l l i o n o f external PPG annual repayments over
2003-2008. Taking advantage o f surplus in the current account, the government i s expected to
follow its declared principle o f decreasing the share o f external debt. Thus, US$1 billion o f PPG
disbursements o f are projected to be complemented by domestic borrowing to cover moderate
fiscal deficits. This in turn will provide the central bank with instruments o f sterilization for the
future.

Fitch has upgradedUkraine’s sovereign rating to B+, Moody’s maintains B2 and S&P B.
These steps include a purchase and restructuring o f T-bills by the NBU, a debt swap with Russia associatedwith
the Black Sea Fleet, Eurobond restructuring, and a Paris Club agreement.

38
Risks
100.

There are three main risks to the proposed strategy.

101. The first, and most relevant for the next few months, i s domestic political risk. As
mentioned earlier, the forthcoming Presidential elections are likely to lead to possible inaction in
the legislature, with l i t t l e chance o f approval o f new legislation, or even the possibility o f
reversal in some key areas that have been o n the agenda for some time (for instance, untargeted
social benefits or tax exemptions for favorite sectors). The Bank will attempt to protect the
strategy from these short-term difficulties by concentrating on implementation o f the substantial
amount o f legislation that has been passed so far and the institutional arrangements that are
necessary to that extent. Looking beyond the Presidential elections, it will be necessary to
evaluate the program o f the new Presidency and the Government that will be in charge o f
executing it. As argued above, the Bank will be positioned to respond to opportunities that might
open, through a High Case lending scenario, as well as accelerated non-lending support. Were a
new administration less interested in the pursuit o f the reform agenda, a C A S progress report will
indicate the ways in which the Bank program would be correspondingly adjusted. The risk o f
decelerated pace o f implementation o f reforms i s met, as mentioned, by the flexible timing o f the
P A L sequence, as was the case during the previous CAS period, as w e l l as by the l o w case if
warranted.
102. A second risk i s o f an external nature, and involves the possibility o f a substantial
weakening in Russia’s economic position, perhaps as a result o f lower o i l prices. As argued
above, the Ukrainian economy remains vulnerable to shifts in the Russian market, although i t s
trade structure has begun a sizeable diversification. The current Government strategy i s
implicitly encouraging diversification o f trade towards the (enlarged) European Union, which
will reduce in the medium-term the dependence o n the Russian markets. In the event o f an
external shock, the Bank would w o r k closely with the IMF, which would have the primary
responsibility to provide short-term liquidity, to ensure that the required short-term adjustments
to Government expenditures do not result in socially destabilizing cuts in critical services.
103. A third risk, also of an external nature, concerns possible difficulties that might arise in
the context o f the accession to the European U n i o n o f the current candidate countries, and h o w
this could be reflected in reduced interest o n the part o f the EU in cultivating a closer
relationship with Ukraine as announced in recent documents. A weakening o f the European
Choice as a possible strategic direction for Ukraine might lead to the questioning o f several promarket, pro-inclusion reforms, and a generalized slow-down in needed institutional
improvements. The Bank will attempt to facilitate a meeting o f the minds between the EU and
Ukraine on the conditions o f future relationships through analytical w o r k and policy dialogue, as
well as helping Ukraine implement the institutional reforms required for harmonization with the
main principles o f the Acquis Communautaire.
104. In addition, general macroeconomic risks will also need to be watched closely. Good
macro-fiscal policies and the implementation o f structural and institutional reforms have
improved macroeconomic stability. However, downside risks remain which can only be reduced
by continued institutional and structural reform. Adverse weather conditions or a significant
slowdown of growth of regional trading partners are the most likely external shocks. The
dramatic growth o f the banking sector (which i s small relative to GDP) and the riskiness o f
banking activity as banks compete for market share, also need to be watched carefully. W h i l e

39
any of these w o u l d present downside risks for the macroeconomic framework, the economy is
becoming more resilient, the debt portfolio i s more balanced, and the country i s showing
improved capacity to adjust i t s fiscal balance and trade flows in light o f incipient macroeconomic
imbalances. Since the financial sector risks are largely internal to the economy, and thus within
the power o f the authorities to address, special attention i s being given to reduce them.
Following up on recommendations o f the recent FSAP, and with the support o f the PAL
sequence, efforts are being made at high quality implementation o f the already established legal
framework, in order to bring banking regulation to the level o f Basel Core Principles, improve
accounting and auditing o f the financial sector, establish a regulatory agency for non-bank
financial institutions, an to address rapidly and fully any potentially systemic weaknesses in the
banking sector (e.g., liquidation o f Bank Ukraina). Nevertheless, a combination o f shocks,
particularly in concert with slow and/or incomplete policy implementation, would put substantial
strains o n the economy and could increase the costs o f domestic and external financing. In this
case, a continued relationship with the IMF and support o f the WB and other donors remains
extremely important for Ukraine’s medium to long run health.

III.CONCLUSIONS

105. Ukraine has enjoyed an auspicious beginning o f i t s second decade o f independence.
Economic indicators have moved in the right direction following several years o f disappointing
results; c i v i l society has grown and so has the demand for better accountability o f Government,
A new sense o f optimism n o w prevails as the possibilities for closer and more productive
integration with Europe and other global structures loom as a reality.
106. European Choice i s n o w seen as the guiding principle for the country, one that provides
the required indications to attain substantive poverty reduction and to propel the country fully in
the 21St century. The remaining challenges are important, and the difficulties must not be
underestimated. The W o r l d Bank Group i s proud to continue to provide assistance in this
endeavor.

CAS COMPLETION REPORT
Ukraine FY01-03
March 2003
I.

COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT RESULTS

1.
The FY01-03 C A S sought to assist Government and c i v i l society in implementing a broad-based
poverty-reduction strategy and in attaining job-creating sustainable economic growth', During the C A S
period the country experienced positive economic growth and macroeconomic stability, and advanced in
setting the institutional foundations for a market economy and building up the role o f c i v i l society. The
relationship between these outcomes and Government actions varies, as reforms often operate with a lag.
Still, even though i t may be unwarranted to associate the improved growth performance completely with
policy actions, the fact i s that the environment in Ukraine has changed definitely in favor o f a market
economy.
2.
Economic Growth and Macroeconomic Stability. During this C A S period and for the f i r s t time
since independence in 199 1, the country experienced jointly economic growth and macroeconomic
stability. K e y facts are: cumulated economic growth at 22% since 1999; inflation d o w n to one-digit
currently; sustained current account surplus, which have quadrupled foreign currency reserves (to 8 weeks
or US$5 billion, despite little external official financing). The Government has maintained a l o w fiscal
deficit, lowered the ratio o f debt to GDP, considerably reduced the stock o f budgetary arrears, and
successfully managed a bunching o f foreign debt maturities in 2001. The economic recovery has gained
momentum and n o w covers both new and o l d sectors o f the economy. Russia's economic growth and
increases in domestic demand explain the improved economic performance.
Towards a Market Economy. Ukraine made substantive advances made in completing the
3.
institutional framework and expanding the scope o f the market economy. Positive indicators include: (a)
a greater share o f output i s produced by the private sector; (b) a better structured legal framework (new
land, budget, financial sector legislation); (c) barter has almost disappeared; (d) internal and external
trade restrictions have significantly been reduced; and (9 market pricing i s dominant. A Civil Code has
recently been approved. Still Ukraine remains short o f t w o goals i t had set itself: (i)
the recognition as
having the legal status o f a market economy, and (ii)
becoming a member o f WTO.

4.
Civil Society. Awareness o f the o f importance o f an active c i v i l society increased. Several line
ministries, some Rada committees, and a f e w public agencies have set-up advisory boards with strong
c i v i l society representation. Civil society actors have shaped a new public agenda, w h i c h has brought
n e w issues, initiatives, and pilot programs to the fore, such as the social partnership paradigm. The
Presidency has mandated development o f consultative mechanisms at a l l levels o f Government, and the
precise mechanisms o f participation are under design. However, public knowledge about the third sector
i s limited and some view i t with suspicion and not fully legitimate.
Poverty. Despite significant sustained economic growth, increases in salaries, elimination o f
5.
pension and wage arrears, reduction in the size o f the shadow economy, and a Government anti-poverty
strategy, early household survey results suggest that poverty indicators have not improved in a substantive
manner. Moreover, it appears that the benefits o f growth have concentrated mostly in urban areas and

'

The stated objectives o f the Government strategy were: (i)
development o f human resources; (ii)
reducing poverty
and increasing the prosperity o f the Ukrainian nation; (iii)
increasing the competitiveness o f Ukraine's economy,
(iv) protecting human rights, freedoms, personal security and the integrity o f the state; and (v) promoting Ukraine's
integration with the European Union. T o obtain these objectives, the Government Program set the following
priorities: (a) strengthening the efficiency o f Government (administration, legal system, regional development); (b)
human development and quality o f life; (c) economic growth; and (d) enhanced competitiveness. The program
stated desired outcomes and identified responsible agencies.

that income inequality has (slightly) increased. The most recent results, however, show that as 2002 this
trend has began to reverse.

11.

CAS OUTCOMES INFLUENCED THROUGH BANK INTERVENTIONS

6.
Design. The C A S supported a Government program formally approved by the Verkhovna Rada
(Parliament) in April, 2000. The CAS, during preparation, was consulted with the government and with
c i v i l society representatives, and was made available to the public through the internet and other means.
The C A S did not make explicit reference to the MDGs (the latter were approved in September 2000, at
the Millennium Summit), but the general orientation o f the Government program was in line with these
goals. The C A S strategy was to focus attention to the determinants o f the demand and supply o f
institutions, and help bridge the gap between written and applied rules. This approach also sought to
tackle the critical problem o f state capture in Ukraine.

7.
T o foster demand o f institutions, the C A S proposed to support activities favoring the
development of c i v i l society and the strengthening o f i t s capacity to demand improved accountability
f r o m Government. W o r k supporting the demand for institutions was included in a l o w case scenario.
The base case included operations supporting actions that the Government would undertake to build
(supply) new market-oriented institutions. The C A S base-case was predicated o n attaining meaningful
benchmarks (outcomes o n the ground) o f institutional improvement, and further Bank assistance/exposure
was also predicated o n continuing process across-the-board.
8.
Summary. Achievement o f substantive outcomes o n the ground moved the assistance strategy to
the base case scenario. This has meant significant advances in the supply o f institutions, as major
roadblocks to economic activity have been removed and k e y institutions have been strengthened: fiscal
management, financial sector, private property (specially in agriculture), the pension system, etc. The
approach based o n outcomes o n the ground, served to focus the dialogue and insure the Bank against
changes in the political agenda. Overall, the authorities have remained committed to the major thrust o f
the institutional reform effort, albeit if the commitment has varied overtime. The c i v i l society agenda has
been implemented effectively, with results that can n o w be scaled-up. The increased voice o f c i v i l
society and the interests o f the constituencies that have emerged as a result o f reforms bode w e l l for the
long-term sustainability o f the reform effort. These voices will increasingly demand modern and sound
institutions and will be a countervailing force to the vested interests that s t i l l remain in place. The E S W
sector w o r k has nourished the reform agenda and will contribute to tighter sector strategies. W o r k with
donors has served to advance critical elements o f the reform initiative. Consultation and communication
are n o w an integral part o f B a n k o n the field. The major shortcoming has been the slow approval and
implementation o f the investment and technical assistance projects. The m a i n outcomes influenced by the
C A S are presented next. Appendix C summarizes key outcomes obtained with the support o f the C A S
program and based o n the policy matrix included in the CAS. Appendix D presents a detailed summary,
by sector, of the outcomes obtained with the support o f the C A S program.

2.1

Thematic Issues : The Supply o f Institutions

9.
The m a i n assistance instruments in advancing the thematic agenda have been the Programmatic
Adjustment L o a n (PAL) program, ESW, policy dialogues in several fronts, and investment/TA projects.
B o x 1 summarizes key achievements in the thematic areas and it shows that the thematic agenda has not
been completed. However, the achievements are substantive and are the core o f stronger market
institutions, and the review below shows. (See also Appendix D, for summaries by sector). In the future,
the thematic agenda should be revised to take account o f achievements thus far and n e w developments in
the economy.
Financial Discipline has improved. The C A S sought, through the PAL and dialogue, to help
10.
government improve financial discipline across the economy. The outcomes reached include: (a)
eliminating budgetary offsets; (b) payment o f taxes in cash; (c) elimination o f wage and pension arrears;

Attachment 1
Page 3 o f 3 2

(d) reduction of a l l other arrears by at least 50% since relative to January 1, 2000; (d) cash payments o f
energy bills going f r o m 10 percent to over 80 percent in t w o years; (9 reduction in the stock o f interenterprise arrears; and (g) reduction o f barter to less than 5 percent o f official economic activity. The
priority n o w centers on addressing the large stock o f inter-enterprise stock o f debt in the energy sector
and halting the increase o f tax arrears. The Bank plans to support further efforts in the tax area with an
investment project -First State Tax Service Modernization Project (STSMP)-- recently approved by the
Board. As foreseen by financial sector ESW, the improved financial discipline facilitated the remonetization o f the economy and contributed to a more stable macroeconomic environment.
11.
Regulatory policy and the business environment have improved. The Bank support for private
sector development, in the previous CAS, had included successful medium and small scale privatization
and deregulation initiatives. P S D support continued during this C A S with positive results. The costs o f
company registration dropped f r o m US$67 in 1999 to US$22 in 2002, and the number o f average
inspections f r o m 16 to 12 in the same period. In fact, the overall cost o f regulatory compliance decreased,
comparing favorably with other F S U countries. At the same time, the number o f SMEs increased f r o m
197 thousands in 1999 to 233 thousands in 2002. The I F C and the Bank conduct periodic surveys to
measure the evolution o f the business environment. The Bank will continue to support regulatory
improvements though a self-standing investment operation, already approved by the Board, geared to
assist efforts at the regional level.

12.
The B a n k has been actively involved in the financial sector and this CAS continued the tradition.
During this C A S period, approval o f k e y laws and regulations have allowed the National Bank o f Ukraine
(NBU) to build i t s capacity to effectively regulate the banking sector. The overall solvency o f the banking
sector has improved, and k e y banking indicators are m o v i n g to international standards. O f particular
importance are the measures, under implementation, to improve the performance o f the State Saving
Bank, the largest in the country, and where past recurrent efforts failed to implement sustainable
solutions. Independent regulation for non-banking financial institutions was established in December,
2002, and i s under development. The Bank has supported financial sector w o r k through 2 pieces o f ESW.
The first, “Ukraine. Financial Sector and the Economy: The New Policy Agenda,” supported w o r k under
PAL. The second, j o i n t l y with the IMF, will serve to frame future policy discussions. Further assistance
to the financial sector includes an investment operation under preparation, with emphasis on
strengthening creditors rights and the development o f a system o f movable property collaterals.
13.
After a two-year hiatus, PAL supported the Government’s efforts to re-start activities toward
WTO accession; the government has set itself the target to j o i n the WTO in 2004. The D u t c h
Government helps these efforts through a grant managed by the Bank. Further support to improve the
regulatory environment, includes draft legislation to enhance the independence and accountability o f the
energy regulator and the regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector. Finally, the Bank,
jointly with the government and local experts, undertook a Legal Diagnostic, which sets the stage for
future w o r k on this important area.

14.
Property Rights are better defined and property is better managed. Regarding property rights,
the most significant achievements took place in agriculture, where kolkhoses were dismantled and 6.7
m i l l i o n land certificates and 3.3 m i l l i o n land titles issued. Moreover, the Government has presented
legislation to the Rada to create a unified real estate registry, setting the basis for a modern cadastre and
expedient and accurate recording o f property rights. Besides the PAL, the Bank will support the
Government’s land titling effort through a L a n d Registration Project, already negotiated.
15.
As to the privatization o f industrial property, under PAL the Bank shifted emphasis to
improving the quality and transparency o f the process. An independent oversight body (the Privatization
Advisory Group) has certified that the transparency o f the privatization processes has improved. On the
other hand, the pace o f privatization o f industrial enterprises picked up, although not as much as the
government was expecting. In the energy sector, six Oblenergos were privatized; further privatizations
await an effective solution to the problem o f inter-enterprise arrears in the sector. The Government

Attachment 1
Page 4 o f 32

prepares, with the support o f the Bank, a new privatization plan to cover 2003-2007. Bankruptcy
procedures are n o w effectively used, including the 13 largest debtors to the state. The license for Bank
Ukraina was removed and the bank i s n o w under liquidation.

16.
The public sector has become more accountable. The C A S fielded a broad effort to improve
the accountability o f the public sector, supported o n the PAL, ESW, and permanent dialogue. Indicators
of improvements in the accountability and capacity o f the public sector include: (a) establishment o f a
single treasury account, with gradual inclusion o f social funds; (b) passage and implementation o f a new
budget code; (c) improvements in the transparency o f and public consultation o f the budget process; (d)
improved reporting requirements o f state owned enterprises; (e) passage and implementation o f a l a w o n
public procurement; (0 reduction o f the number o f ministries and other executive power bodies f r o m 89
to 50, including 16 ministries; (8) establishment and refinement o f a formula-based system o f fiscal
transfers directly to oblasts, rayons and cities; (h) de-politization o f the c i v i l service through the
establishment o f state secretaries; (i)improved and more transparent procedures f o r c i v i l service hiring
and promotion; and (j)increased tax collections by 3 percent o f GDP in 2003. PAL continues to support
tax reform, through the broadening o f the tax bases. The Bank has provided a range ESW in this area:
PIER, CFAA, Procurement Review, Fiscal Study, Regional Study. These works served as the basis for
the development o f Financial Accountability and Procurement action plans under PAL. The STSMP
should help improve the transparency and accountability o f the tax authorities. An investment project
(expected to go to the Board in FY04) will support improvements in statistical system, which w o u l d
allow development o f measurable indicators to monitor implementation o f Government programs.
17.
Social and environment risks. The major achievements in dealing with social risks have been o n
the management and consolidation o f social assistance programs and the pension reform dialogue. The
Government has also sought to simplify and streamline the m y r i a d o f benefits and privileges.
Interestingly, the focus groups in the client survey supported such streamlining. The Rada has been less
supportive o f the idea, and progress in this area has been below expectations. The Government also
prepared and approved a poverty strategy. The Bank supported this effort with ESW-“Social Safety
Nets and Poverty and Risk and Vulnerability”.

18.
The Bank Social Investment Fund operation, already under implementation, has been active
helping mitigate social risks among the poor. The Bank also prepares an investment operation to develop
the institutional infrastructure needed f o r setting-up a nationwide system o f targeted social assistance.
The newly approved T B I A I D S project will help control the growth o f these contagious deceases. The
Bank studies further the patterns o f poverty and their links with economic performance, thorough a new
CEM and a risk and vulnerability note, both under preparation. Hopefully a clearer view o f the
relationship between economic growth and poverty reduction in Ukraine will be attained. Sector
strategies developed in health and education provide a basis to design realistic reforms within sustainable
financing plans, consistent with local Government finance. On the environment, PAL supported the
Government’s commitment t o undertaking an Environmental Expenditure Review. Given the long-term
gestation periods o f environment initiatives before tangible results o n the ground can be obtained, the
Government Program targeted interim results in capacity building and p i l o t programs.
2.2

Civil Society: The Demand for Institutions

19.
Support for c i v i l society in the C A S has been part o f building demand f o r institutions. The Bank
has pursued this objective through three avenues: (a) direct projects with c i v i l society; (b) cooperation
c i v i l society in design and implementation o f Bank projects; and (c) the promotion o f a larger role f o r
c i v i l society. The achievements in this C A S period set the basis for scaling-up in the next CAS.
Appendices E and F reports in detail o n the c i v i l society w o r k during this C A S period.
Direct Projects. Direct programs during this C A S period have included: the creation o f an NGO
20.
contact group; the continuation of the People’s Voice project; the setting up o f the Institutional
Development Fund (Dialogue for Reforms); organizing the innovation day andknowledge forum;

Attachment 1
Page 5 o f 3 2

publishing and distributing an NGO bulletin; and, a small grants program. The NGO contact group,
established in the fall o f 2000, has helped guide WB c i v i l society agenda. When established, it was a
unique experience in Ukraine. Participants have found an open forum where to consider a broad range o f
issues, including the mission o f the group, strategies to strengthen c i v i l society, tax treatment o f NGOs,
the role of the B a n k in c i v i l society issues in Ukraine, etc. The Ministry o f Economy i s considering
establishing a Civil Society Advisory Group patterned o n the NGO contact group. The NGO contact
group n o w considers h o w to redefine i t s mission as the scope o f c i v i l society activities increases.

21.
The People’s Voice Project i s a pioneer program o f c i v i l society involvement in Ukraine and in
the region. The pilot phase (financed by CIDA and administered by the Bank) operated in four cities and
has n o w been completed. A follow-up project i s expected to cover 6 new cities. A thorough evaluation
of the project effectiveness i s underway. The project has contributed to improving coordination among
donors, communication between public officials and the community, and l e d to greater overall
transparency in the management o f public resources at the local level. The experience has served to
enrich implementation o f the Social Investment Fund (FY02) and the Institutional Development Fund
project (dialogue for reforms), financed with IDF resources and managed by the Ministry o f the
Economy. This project supports Government commitment to consult reform initiatives, obtain feedback,
and involve c i v i l society actors in the execution and monitoring public programs, at the local level. A
recent evaluation showed that the W o r l d Bank’s c i v i l society projects are w e l l designed, properly
targeted, and very inclusive. The evaluation also concluded that these efforts have supported institutional
innovations, models for public dialogue, and are seen as triggers f o r the c i v i l society mobilization.
22.
Civil Society and Bank Projects. The Bank has also sought to involve c i v i l society in the design
and implementation o f individual projects. The Review in the Appendix F shows that several elements o f
civic engagement have been internalized in the project cycle and that a number o f initiatives have brought
good results. The Bank i s gradually learning to articulate c i v i l society into its, and the experience with the
preparation o f the TB/HIV project shows that improvements have been made. At the same time, a
number o f the following challenges emerged:
(a) Civic engagement i s most successful when it i s driven by the project’s development objectives
and i s an intrinsic part o f project activities. Identifying stakeholders and their interests i s an important prerequisite f o r determining the scope and nature o f civic engagement, but requires a clear formulation o f the
project’s development outcomes, and identification o f potential social issues and impacts.

(b) Participatory monitoring clearly emerges as a w a y o f intensifying civic engagement and

strengthen a l l o f the reviewed projects. In participatory monitoring, primary stakeholders are active
participants and not just sources o f information.
(c) W h e n projects face limited cooperation and commitment f r o m administrations responsible for
implementing particular sectoral reforms, an ongoing analysis o f the (local/ national) political economy
should be backed by an alliance w i t h c i v i l society to push f o r reform.

23.
The Broader Agenda. A recent review o f WB activities shows the W o r l d Bank i s seen as an
important mediator for c i v i l society to communicate with the Government as w e l l as a vital coordinator
and an information source. Also, the W o r l d Bank i s seen as an important contributor o f ideas and a
builder o f institutional infrastructure for information sharing, consultation, and cooperation between
public, private, and third sectors. In the future, it will b e necessary to see h o w the Bank can best
contribute to the development o f stable consultation mechanisms amongst the Government, the Rada, and
c i v i l society, and to improving the legal framework f o r c i v i l society activities.

24.
The Public Perception. Despite important achievements, there i s limited awareness o f the WB
involvement in c i v i l society activities f r o m others than those directly involved. There i s also the
perception o f considerable overlapping among the activities and initiatives o f the various donor agencies
and a greater degree o f coordination i s called for. Some see the B a n k playing the role o f coordinator.

MEASURING BANK PERFORMANCE

25.
The Bank has assisted the Government in developing i t s medium t e r m vision, identifying
benchmarks and milestones to reach the intended objectives and marshalling required technical
assistance either directly or f r o m third parties. The programmatic approach has become the
modus operandi o f Government with a high degree o f ownership. The Bank i s n o w seen as a
partner. The Government has come to view the Bank’s support as k e y to i t s legitimacy within the
international community, for attracting donor support and encouraging investment in Ukraine. On
the downside, program implementation has been slower than initially expected, as the pace of
reform slowed d o w n and problems were encountered with prompt development o f investment
projects. Still, the Bank has maintained a constructive relationship with government, despite the
ups and down o f the reform agenda.

3.1

The Lending Program

26.
Project Approvals. The status o f the lending program i s presented in Table 1, Appendix
A. The following operations have been approved by the Board during the current C A S period:
Social Investment Fund, Azov-Black Sea Corridor Biodiversity Conservation (GEF), Lviv Water
and Waste Water, P A L I,T B / H I V / A I D S Control, and the Private Sector Development Loan.
Three additional operations have been negotiated -- the E-Development TA Project, the First
State Tax Service Modernization Program (STSMP), and the Rural L a n d Titling and Cadastre
Development Project. Invitation to negotiate has been issued f o r PAL-11. The design for PAL-I11
i s in place and some o f the benchmarks have been achieved. Should PAL-I1 proceed as expected,
PAL-I11 i s feasible in FY05. By the end o f FY03, the Board approved a total o f $US732.46
million, or 40.3 % o f the projected commitments under C A S Base-Case Scenario ($US1,816.0
million). These investment operations provide critical support to advancing the thematic
achievements under PAL.
27.
At the end o f the C A S period, a number o f operations referred to above remain at
different stages under preparation. The Statistics, Municipal Development, and Finance projects
are expected to go to the Board in FY04. The Social Assistance Reform operation i s under
preparation for FY05. Thus, the bulk o f the lending problem w o u l d be completed with about one
year’s delay. A number o f projects did not materialize. The Sevastopol Heating project was
cancelled, after Board approval, due to the failure o f the local Council to ratify the operation. The
Public Administration Reform Incentives and the Pre-Export Guarantee Facility were cancelled
when i t became apparent that the conditions for success were n o longer present. Preparation o f a
Social Sector Adjustment operation for FY03 was not initiated as i t was considered that it would
not be necessary to have a complementary adjustment operation o n social sectors, given that the
PAL platform. Preparation o f the Coal Restructuring Project (FYO1) was cancelled due to
changes in government priorities. The Bank initiated a Coal Sector Study, w h i c h i s being used to
garner a national consensus o n directions for reform in this sector. W o r k o n Environmental
Pollution, proposed for FY03, was not initiated due to the slow advance in strengthening the
institutions to deal with environmental issues.
Project Implementation. I t i s clear that project processing and implementation in
28.
Ukraine continue to be problematic, although the issue i s less complicated with respect to
adjustment operations. The delays largely reflect the speed o f implementation o f the Government
program, as compared to initial expectations. The flexibility o f the assistance program to adjust to
the speed o f the reform program can be improved, in the future, by including a high case scenario
in the C A S design, so that proper account can be taken o f the periods in which reforms advance at
a faster pace.

Attachment 1
Page 8 o f 3 2

29.
However, action are also needed to reduce the lead-times in preparing and implementing
investment projects, and assure prompt delivery o f the technical assistance and investment
needed to support the development o f policy initiatives under the CAS. Changes in the internal
bureaucratic procedures within Government early in this C A S period did not solve the problem,
as i t was expected they would. These mechanisms are under review again; initial implementation
o f recommendations should be required before the new C A S period begins. Other factors that
m a y contribute to delays include: (i)
l o w technical capacity o f counterparts; (ii)
lack o f adequate
supporting institutional frameworks ; (iii)changes in the level o f ownership as public officials in
charge are rotated; and (iv) conflicting stakeholders interests. The Country Unit commissioned a
study o f the political economy factors affecting project preparation and ratification. As a result, a
set o f political feasibility criteria/checklist were developed to screen projects before they are
included in the C A S and preparation works are initiated. Overall, i t should be a requirement for
a l l projects t o undertake a careful at-entry evaluation o f the adequacy o f the supporting
institutional frameworks-ownerships,
laws in place, technical capacity, etc. Also, careful
thought should be given about lending directly to municipalities given that some past operations
have to be cancelled.
30.
PAL Impact. PAL has marked a dramatic change in the consistency, ownership, and
quality o f the dialogue between the Bank and the Government. There i s an increased
understanding o n both sides about the nature o f the problems facing Ukraine, the solutions that
can work, the political economy limitations, and the way the Government and the Bank can w o r k
together to implement solutions. Also, the design o f the operation has worked very w e l l in the
current Ukrainian political situation. Specifically,
The outcomes obtained under the thematic approach have facilitated development and
implementation o f sector agendas. P A L should continue to focus o n thematic issues.
The emphasis o n outcomes, as measures o f progress in implementing the Government
program, has proven effective and should continue. This requires, however, carefully drafted
strategies o f h o w to get to these outcomes and making sure that the necessary technical
assistance, f r o m the Bank or f r o m another donors, i s available.
The alignment with the Government program and the linguistic shift f r o m conditionality to
benchmark have enhanced ownership.
P A L preparation and dialogue has facilitated the creation o f strong technical counterpart
teams.
Bringing together the k e y thematic issues in a comprehensive setting facilitated an
understanding o f linkages and the development o f a sense o f priorities. The overarching midterm PAL vision, with concrete outcomes at the end o f the period, allows Ukraine to track i s
movement towards a market economy.
However, a drawback in the design o f the PAL has been the difficulty with differentiating
I,
between base and high case scenarios; as already mentioned, this problem can be solved by
introducing explicitly a high case.

3.2

Economic and Sector W o r k

32.
E S W has largely followed the outline discussed in the C A S document, providing critical
support to PAL and setting the basis for improved sector strategies. ESW has improved the
Bank’s understanding o f the situation in Ukraine and thus improve the timeliness and quality o f
the assistance. Studies have been amply consulted with stakeholders. Table 1, Appendix B,
summarizes the status o f ESW. Highlights o f E S W include:

Attachment 1
Page 9 o f 32

Support for improved management o f public resources--CFAA, CPAR, PER, a Regional
Study, and a Fiscal Study on taxation.
Emphasis o n political economy issues to understand problems with project preparation.

A Gender Study focused o n issues o f poverty, labor market discrimination, entrepreneurship
opportunities, politics, and trafficking in persons.
Support in the preparation o f the National Poverty strategy and the reform o f social safety
nets and privileges, with the “Social Safety Nets and Poverty” and “Risks and Vulnerability”
studies.
The Environment Expenditure Review analyzed the effectiveness o f public expenditure and
provides inputs for the program in the next CAS.
Financial sector E S W (Ukraine, the Financial Sector and the Economy) contributed to PAL
design. The Bank and the IMF just completed a Financial Sector Assessment Program,
which provides stakeholders with the basis to continue institutional development and monitor
risks to the sector.
The Coal Study, responding to an stale mate in reform, sorts out the complex links between
mine closures, labor demobilization, and pricing o f coal.

33.
E S W in progress includes: (i)
CEM, which seeks to sort out the linkage between growth,
poverty, and institutional reforms; (ii)
a j o i n t review with the OECD o f the agriculture sector; and
(iii)
an energy sector study, w h i c h will provide a comprehensive view o f the energy issues and
challenges in Ukraine.
3.3

OED and QAG

34.
OED. OED produced a Country Assistance Evaluation for Ukraine in 1999 and
completed several audits during this C A S period. The CAS, during design and implementation,
has incorporated and expanded o n the k e y OED lessons and recommendations. The Bank’s effort,
the extent possible, to develop a shared vision with government i s very much in line with
recurrent OED recommendation. Emphasis o n a greater role o f c i v i l society has broaden the role
o f partners and stakeholders during project preparation and implementation, a k e y OED
recommendation in several reviews. The C A S has given pride o f place to improving the
accountability o f govemment, with the w o r k o n fiscal decentralization and the development o f
Financial and Procurement Action Plans in PAL. The C A S also heeded OED’s advice not to
engage in sector operations unless proper conditions were in place. This has been the basis o f the
thematic approach, which has helped clear the way for improved sector performance. N o sector
adjustment lending has been undertaken in this period. Pooling all adjustment resources under
PAL contributed to a far more focused dialogue with government and helped structure
cooperation with other donors, a strategy recommended by OED.

35.
The C A S also supported a reduced role o f government in agriculture as proposed by
OED; significant output increases have ensued. The Bank canceled a Coal project under
preparation as the Government shifted i t s strategy in the sector, thus lowering expectations in the
sector, very much in line with OED observations. In electricity, the gradually improving
macroeconomic environment will allow, with time, full implementation o f previous Bank
initiatives that ,while visionary, proved premature as remarked by OED. In the financial sector,
the Bank agenda has continued to focus o n better regulation and dealing with trouble banks, in
line with OED recommendations. PSD work, reviewed positively by OED, has focused o n
regulatory improvements, transparent privatization, and gradually introducing technology
through e-development. Public administration reform, an area emphasized by OED, has proceed
at a slower pace than expected. Institutional w o r k in the social sectors has improved, and reversed

Attachment 1
Page 10 o f 32

the unsatisfactory trend detected by OED. Still, the country i s far f r o m the pervasive social
reforms it requires. Lastly, the Bank has continued to increase i t s understanding o f political
economy issues, building o n previous progress identified by OED.

QAG. There was a number o f QAG activities o n the lending and E S W programs. The
36.
E S W “Ukraine, The Financial Sector and the Economy” was rated by QAG as highly
satisfactory.
The sub-categories Scope and Strategic Relevance and the Dialogue and
Dissemination were also rated as highly satisfactory. At the impact was rated as satisfactory,
given the difficult situation o f Ukraine at the time. With the benefit o f hindsight, the work has
had a highly positive impact directly and as support to P A L . The E S W “Social Safety Nets and
Poverty” rated as satisfactory. The QAG carried out a Quality at Entry Assessment in August
2001 o f the Kyiv Water project, and the overall rating for the project was satisfactory. PREM put
together a panel to review the State Tax Administration Modernization project, and not formally
graded, the review was highly complementary o f the design. QAG has carried out a review o f the
AAA program in Ukraine completed during this C A S period. The overall rating was
“satisfactory.”
3.4

The Client Surveys

37.

The Bank undertook one Government and one Client survey during this period.

38.
World Bank Government Survey. Respondents had a positive perception o f (a) the
Bank officials’ knowledge about Ukraine; (b) the effectiveness Kyiv’s Country Office; and (c)
the quality o f analytical materials available. H a l f o f the respondents rated the W o r l d Bank
program in Ukraine as effective, and a third did not. Assistance to education and science was
rated the lowest. L a c k of market-friendly legislation was seen as the m a i n stumbling block for
the effectiveness o f the Bank’s w o r k o n Ukraine. The respondents recommended building up the
negotiating and analytical capacity o f the Ukrainian officials as a way to balance the relationship
between the Bank and the Ukrainian counterparts. Also, they emphasized that long-term
cooperation w o u l d benefit f r o m a greater involvement o f Ukrainian partners in the Bank’s w o r k
and a deeper knowledge o f the local situation. The majority o f the respondents thought that
consultation with the communities improves quality o f the projects.
Client Assessment Survey. The general perception i s that Ukraine has made recently
39.
significant advances in improving the economic situation, but that further advances are needed f o r
truly market-friendly institutions in the country to take hold. The attitude towards eliminating
professional privileges, with corresponding salary adjustments, and targeting social benefits to the
needy was positive. There was agreement that eliminating budgetary offsets that a positive
impact that that barter had lost relevance. Respondents saw i t as important to monitor public
expenditure and control at the local level, but they were pessimistic that misuse o f public funds
could be eliminated completely. On the other hand, there was criticisms o f the Bank’s role in the
closure o f mines , and called o n to give greater emphasis to the development o f new business and
the creation of n e w jobs. Respondents were not very sympathetic to bankruptcy because o f
employment losses and the social consequences. The respondents have a negative attitude o n
privatization, such as electric companies.

IV.

CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION

40.
An extensive process o f consultations
implementation o f the CAS.

accompanied the preparation and the

41.
CAS Consultations. C A S preparation began soon after a n e w Government came to
power, following the 1999 Presidential elections. After the economic program o f the new
Government was approved by the Rada in April 2000, consultations followed o n h o w to align the

Attachment 1
Page 11 o f 32

assistance program with the government strategy. C A S consultation c i v i l society representatives
was a novel experience to Ukraine; fortunately, the new Government had already consulted c i v i l
society representations while preparing i t s o w n program. The C A S was made available t o the
public during preparation, and i t was posted in the Web.
42.
Partnerships. The Bank activities in Ukraine during the C A S period were marked by the
increased cooperation with bilateral and multilateral donors. Cooperation with D u t c h and EU
assistance has been has been centered o n improving financial accountability in Government and
support for the W T O accession. Joint w o r k with the EBRD and U S A I D assisted in the electricity
sector. S I D A cooperation centered o n the areas o f enterprise development, administrative reform,
environmentally and socially sustainable development. DFID provided assistance both at national
as w e l l as individual oblast level (Donetsk, Kharkiv, Odesa) in poverty reduction studies and
dialogue, public administration reform and social development. Through i t s National T A C I S
program, EU has provided the Bank with additional leverage in the areas o f institutional, legal
and administrative reform, private sector development, social sector reforms. CIDA in Ukraine i s
focused o n governance, working o n the demand and supply o f institutions. Moreover, the
Canadian resources financed the very successful People’s Voice Project. EBRD has built i t s
strategy in close collaboration with the Bank in the areas o f small and medium enterprise
development, strengthening o f the banking sector, assisting the transition o f the corporate
enterprises, modernizing public utilities, improving energy efficiency and nuclear safety. U S A I D
Technical Assistance to Ukraine has been highly complementary with the k e y aspects o f the
CAS, mainly the work in the areas o f Capital and Business markets development, capacity
building efforts for fiscal, banking reform, commercial l a w and energy sector reforms. Also the
Bank teamed with U S A I D in expediting the process o f land titling and privatization. Practically
a l l donors assisted the Bank in i t s efforts to promote c i v i l society involvement in the C A S
formulation and implementation, provided expertise and resources for the public outreach
projects.
43.
IFC. The C A S strategy was produced jointly with the IFC. IFC focused i t s efforts o n
technical assistance to foster the development o f the private sector and mobilized close to US$38
m i l l i o n in donor funding. Four TA projects are under implementation: (i)
corporate development
agribusiness development to improve
to help local companies attract investment partners; (ii)
the supply chains and facilitate farmers’ access to financing; (iii) S M E electronic toolkit
development piloting an internet portal designed to increase SMEs’ access t o financing; and (iv)
the annual S M E survey, which IFC has conducted since 1996. IFC has also provided support in
formulating a new draft L a w o n Leasing. IFC investment activity has been low. The first real
sector project has been a US$10 m i l l i o n loan for the modernization o f the Damen-Okean
shipyards in Mykolaiv. IFC limited engagement signals that the investment climate in Ukraine
has traditionally been difficult.
44.
MIGA. During the C A S period MIGA has facilitated estimated foreign direct investment
o f US$30 m i l l i o n into Ukraine. MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Ukraine consists o f one contract
o f guarantee in the financial sector with a total gross exposure o f US$19.0 million. Currently,
MIGA has two expressions o f interest for projects in manufacturing for a total o f US$8.9 million.
When promoting itself as a destination for foreign direct investment, Ukraine can also benefit
f r o m access to M I G A ’ s online investor information services, which provide a vehicle for
disseminating information o n the investment climate and business opportunities in the country.
45.
IMF. The C A S strategy was discussed with the IMF. The Fund completed the EFF
program in September 2002, with tranches totaling US$550 m i l l i o n undisbursed due to the IMF
concerns about the 2002 budget situation and failure t o agree with the Ukrainian Authorities o n a
schedule for repayment o f VAT refunds. Currently IMF i s working o n the precautionary StandBy arrangement w i t h Ukraine. The IMF and the B a n k have made a successful effort to w o r k

Attachment 1

within clearly defined rules, with the Bank concentrating o n structural development issues. Still,
there i s considerable overlap between the two programs.

V.

SUSTAINABILITY

46.
The achievements obtained during this C A S period are likely t o be sustainable. Some o f
the key outcomes are irreversible: the transfer o f land to private hands, the increased financial
discipline, improvements in the business environment, improved public sector governance
(procurement, fiscal decentralization, treasury management), etc. These achievements provide
solid grounds upon w h i c h to increase welfare in the short-term. Over the medium term, however,
sustained growth will require continued investment in physical and human capital. The study
commissioned by the Bank o n the sources o f growth suggests that institutional reform efforts will
have to continue so as to provide credible and favorable conditions f o r investment. In conclusion,
while the achievements under this C A S appear quite irreversible, to ensure sustained growth will
require continued improvement in the institutional environment.

47.
Political factors, however, will continue to affect the capacity o f the government to
reform. The costs o f putting together governing coalitions are high and complex relationships
between the executive and the Rada often do not coalesce to advance necessary legislation, even
if there are n o mayor disagreements o n the fundamentals o f reform. I t i s likely that Ukraine will
continue to muddle through in the future.
VI.

LESSONS FOR SUBSEQUENT CAS DESIGN

48.
Align the CAS with Government Strategy. Alignment o f the C A S strategy with the a
Government Program, ratified the Rada, increased ownership and commitment and facilitated
stakeholder consultation. N e x t C A S should likewise be aligned with the President’s initiatives,
and a Government Program (ratified by the Rada).
49.
Continue the thematic approach. The thematic approach continues to be valid and
should be continued in the next CAS, while rethinking the content based o n the achievements
thus far, the results o f ESW, and the dialogue with Government. The thematic approach and the
complementary investment agenda (from this and the future CAS) should provide a sound basis
to continue support for the supply o f good institutions.

50.
Define a high case scenario. Given Ukraine’s muddling through approach to reform, i t i s
advisable to define a high case assistance scenario to properly support the country when the
reform agenda moves ahead briskly.
51.
Strengthen Outcome Orientation. The emphasis o n outcomes for PAL led to
irreversible results o n the ground that enhance the sustainability o f a market economy. This
approach should be continued and strengthened in the next CAS, developing a set o f expected
outcomes at the sector level. Specially, attention should be given as to h o w Millennium
Development Goals can b e implemented in Ukraine.

52.
Scale-up Civil Engagement. B a n k assistance to Ukraine leads the region in matters o f
c i v i l engagements. N e x t C A S should scale-up this w o r k in the three m a i n fronts: (a) small pilotl i k e activities o f direct w o r k between the Bank and c i v i l society; (b) the involvement o f c i v i l
society in Bank projects; and (b) the role o f Bank in fostering a useful and productive dialogue
between the Government and c i v i l society.
53.
Improve Loan Approval and Implementation.
Improvements in the design and
implementation o f investment/TA projects i s needed to increase the effectiveness o f the
assistance to Ukraine. This requires, o n the part o f Government, to streamline project approval
processes and disbursement procedures. Also, the Bank and the Government need to ensure that

Attachment 1
Page 13 o f 32

the required bases (laws and technical capacity) are ready for successful project design and
approval before undertaking the project preparation. A temporary halt to lending directly to
municipalities should be put in place. During implementation, clear and feasible implementation
targets should be set and monitored.

54.
Take Account of Political Developments. The political environment in Ukraine
continues to be uncertain, and i t i s likely to become even more so with the forthcoming
presidential elections, affecting the pace o f reform. The design o f the next C A S should take
likely developments into account. Also, given the political uncertainty, advancing in civic
engagement becomes even a greater priority.
Strengthen Sector Agendas. T o fully reap the benefits o f the achievements obtained
55.
through the thematic approach requires greater emphasis o n strengthening institutions at the
sector level through TA, ESW, or investment operations. The experience o f the last shows that
these results are slow to come. F o r the next period, an effort should be made that sector teams are
selective in the areas o f intervention and operate with a clear sense o f priority to obtain concrete
results, and build confidence and credibility. I t i s necessary to develop clear benchmarks and
expected outcomes at the sector level.
Help build up the capacity of Government. Effective and structured dialogue in a
56.
framework o f mutual respect can help build capacity among the counterparts. One important byproduct o f the PAL dialogue has been the advances made in the internal organization o f the
Govemment. This approach enhanced ownership. However, m u c h greater efforts are needed to
truly improve the capacity o f the public administration.

57.
Well targeted E S W helps both thematic and sector agendas. Economic and sector w o r k
has helped fill substantial knowledge gaps, enriching the programmatic approach and setting the
foundations f o r more detailed sector strategies--agriculture, environment, electricity, poverty and
social assistance, health and education, coal (if there i s a meeting o f minds after the study i s
completed), financial, and fiscal management. E S W should continue to support w o r k o n
improving sector strategies and the identification o f outcomes to measure the progress o f reform.
58.
Consultation enhances reform sustainability. The Government has taken the first steps
in the development o f an institutional framework f o r consultation with stakeholders in policy
design and implementation. N e x t C A S should support the development o f these efforts.
Broadening the audience of the Bank. The Bank faces the challenge o f accurately
59.
communicating to the public the nature o f i t s assistance t o the country and the results that are
achieved. Client surveys show a limited understanding o f the role o f the Bank and often a
misunderstanding o f the scope o f i t s activities and influence. I t i s necessary to broaden the Bank’s
audience in the dialogue with the country.

APPENDIX D: SECTOR ISSUES AND PERFORMANCE
Fiscal/Macro/Economic
Fiscal and macro issues have been at the core o f the PAL design. K e y successes in
1.
eliminating budget offsets and reducing significantly budgetary arrears have brought budgetary
management under greater control and benefited the economy. A new Budget Code sets clear
procedural standards--from preparation to evaluation--for national and regional Governments.
Clearer rules for the transfer o f resources to local Governments have been developed in parallel
and are having a significant impact o n the ground. Local Governments o n their o w n initiative are
moving to rationalize service delivery networks. The Bank has provided support in fiscal
decentralization through dialogue, an IDF grant, and a study o n regional perspectives in Ukraine.
The latter, with a broader scope, has served to motivate thinking o n regional issues among
officials and c i v i l society as the regional consequences o f a market economy are a k e y national
concern.
2.
Support for improving fiscal institutions has centered attention o n procurement and fiscal
accountability, further developing the budget code. W o r k conducted under a Comprehensive
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), a Comprehensive Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR), and a Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) have provided the inputs to
further improve public sector accountability. Current priorities include the specification o f a
proper accountability framework for all actors in the management o f public moneys, extension o f
modern procurement procedures to cover most public expenditures, and improved oversight and
governance o f public enterprises. A D u t c h Government grant supports these efforts. With the
development o f a unified treasury at the national and oblast level, budget management attention
will have to shift to commitment control and importantly to improve budget preparation.
3,
Despite these achievements, the fiscal situation remains precarious. P A L has supported
the Government’s efforts to address tax arrears systematically. The corresponding analysis has
shown that soft budget constraints and misaligned tariffsiprices in public enterprises are partly the
culprits. A Fiscal Study undertaken by the Bank in FY02-FY03 (not originally in the CAS) has
shown that political interests have l e d to tax exemptions puncturing the tax base. The PAL
dialogue has picked these issues. Tax reform, however, i s not only about revenue generation but
creation o f a fair and even-playing field for all. The State Tax Administration Modernization
Project (STAMP), an APL already approved by the Board, will help advance this institutional
effort. The S T A M P supports important institutional innovations to improve the accountability o f
the tax authorities. Revenue difficulties have pressured expenditure reductions without the benefit
o f coherent sector strategies. Sector w o r k and the budget procedural reforms provide the basis for
a comprehensive approach to expenditure reform, possibly in the context o f a MTEF.

4.
T o improve understanding o f the sources and the sustainability o f the recent spur o f
economic growth, the Bank contracted an independent study with a regional consultant. Such
study highlighted the need for continued institutional reform for sustainable growth. A CEM
(FY03) under preparation should help improve the understanding further the links between
institutional reforms and the pattern and characteristics o f economic growth.
Human Resources and Social Welfare
5.
The thematic approach under PAL supported the Government stated priorities o f human
development and fighting poverty. Eliminating pension arrears put a halt to the loss o f the
legitimacy o f the pension system and the reform o f the budget code and new rules f o r fiscal
decentralization have brought greater effectiveness and accountability in the execution o f social
programs at the local level. O n a sector specific basis, C A S assisted the Government in (i)
addressing critical emergencies and improving the delivery o f basic social services to vulnerable

Attachment 1
Page 22 o f 32

and poor populations; and (ii)the development o f viable poverty reduction and sector reform
strategies and their initial implementation. The assistance program included a package o f lending
and non-lending instruments and the experience thus far has produced concrete results.
Critical emergencies. The Bank has assisted through 2 projects: First, the Social
6.
Investment Fund (SIF), under implementation, provides mechanisms to mobilize community
initiatives and provide communal services in poor communities; the project also develops models
o f social care for the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups o f the population. The PAL program
has supported social care reform by encouraging the expansion o f outreach, community based
care, and preparing legislation for service provision by non-Governmental parties. A modern
Social Care draft l a w has been prepared and i s submitted to the Rada f o r approval. Second, the
T B / H I V / A I D S control project supports implementation o f the 2002-2004 Government strategy,
developed under P A L , and supported by technical assistance during project preparation. This
operation, the f i r s t o f i t s kind in the region, was approved by the Board in December, 2002.
Ukraine also was awarded GFATM funding for T B / H I V / A I D S control activities f o r a period o f
about 5 years.
Poverty.
The WB studies “Social Safety Nets and Poverty” and “Risk and
Vulnerability ” helped the Government prepare the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and the
strategy for reform o f social safety nets and privileges. Currently, the Bank prepares a study o n
“Improving Safety Nets and Labor Market Policies” to better understand the links between
economic growth and poverty reduction. The study should help the government’s efforts to
reduce poverty and vulnerability.

7.

8.
Social assistance and social privileges. The consolidation o f social assistance programs,
in the framework o f the PAL, can be considered as the most important outcome o f the j o i n t w o r k
between the Bank and the Government o f Ukraine during the past t w o years in this area. The
Bank continues to support these efforts and n o w prepares a Social Protection Administration
Reform Project, which will be presented to the Board in FY05. This project will help build an
adequate infrastructure for the provision o f social assistance, targeting it to the poor and needed.
9.
Pension reform. The Government strategy for pensions seeks to provide security for the
elderly within the context o f short and long term financial viability. Economic growth and
improved financial discipline in this C A S period eliminated pension arrears and brought financial
stability to the pension system. A dialogue among the stakeholders has produced draft legislation,
n o w considered by the Rada, that restructures the compulsory PAYG pension system and
introduces o f three pillar pension system. The Bank has supported these efforts through PAL and
an ongoing pension policy dialogue. Attention has also been given transparent management o f the
funds and emerging unregulated pension schemes. Besides the policy dialogue, attention has
extended to developing efficient technical support for contribution collection, pension
determination, data management and benefit payment. Once legislation i s approved the country
will need considerable technical and financial support.

10.
Health and Education Reform. During this C A S period, the Government o f Ukraine
developed comprehensive long term health and education reform strategies, w h i c h were
supported by PAL. In addition Health and Education Bank policy notes provided the basis f o r
discussion of systematic problems and reaching common understanding o f the issues and possible
ways o f addressing them. Aware of the problems o f equity, quality, and efficiency in the delivery
health and education services in a changing environment, the Government has adopted and started
implementing measures for optimization o f school and health networks in rural areas. Moreover,
the Government has requested B a n k support for an Education Reform Project, which w o u l d
provide assistance towards improving quality, access and efficiency, as w e l l as increasing
planning and management capacities at central and local levels.

Attachment 1

11.
However, such had been the deterioration o f the institutions o f the social sectors and i t s
financing, that the strong economic performance after 2000 did not translate in substantial
improvements in the social system performance. Still the work done during this C A S period can
point to concrete achievements and, above all, it has set the basis f o r the development o f more
detailed strategies and greater ownership and commitment. These strategies will have to bring
programs in line with available resources and guarantee an efficient and equitable use o f
resources.
Environment

12.
The assistance strategy for the environment during this C A S period has centered o n (a)
developing the knowledge base; (b) selected pilot initiatives; and (b) building up the institutional
apparatus to implement environment policy. Support was provided through the P A L - I
environmental policy benchmarks and the GEF funded A z o v Black Sea Corridor Biodiversity
Project approved in FY 02. Additionally, three AAA initiatives included: (i)the Environment
Public Expenditure Review (ii)a forest sector note (Challenges for Sustainable Forest
Management and Reform); and (iii)an Enabling Activity for Biodiversity Conservation (GEFfinanced) :
13,
The PAL strengthened capacity in enforcement o f environmental impact assessments and
The Environmental
extended the knowledge base for integrated pollution prevention.
Expenditure Review focused o n environmental financing issues and related Government policies.
I t confirmed that Ukraine s t i l l faces daunting environmental challenges such as inadequate water
supply and solid waste services, urban air pollution, pollution o f water resources, degradation o f
coastal areas, soil erosion and natural hazards. Additionally, administrative weaknesses in the
system o f economic incentives promote n o n compliance and overexploitation o f natural resources
and undermine business competitiveness. The report recommended that more than 1600
Environmental hnds be consolidated and environmental financing b e separated f r o m pollution
charges. Priorities f o r the Bank’s assistance include policy and regulatory improvements,
streamlining the system o f environmental financing and enhancing monitoring capacity and
environmental compliance. In terms o f meeting MDGs, Ukraine i s probably the most vulnerable
as concerns access to water and sanitation to the poor in rural areas.

14.
Ukraine’s 10.7 m i l l i o n ha o f forest i s one o f the largest forest areas o f any ECA country.
The sector can contribute more to economic growth while maintaining global and national
environmental benefits. The Forest sector note advocates reforms in forest policy to better
capture environment, economic and social benefits o f forests, and to develop forest management
and ownership forms better adapted to those o f a market economy. Capacity building activities in
forest certification as a tool for developing sustainable forest management are underway, financed
by the Bank/WWF Alliance for Forest Conservation.
15.
The Azov/Black Sea Biodiversity project finances integrated landscape planning, wetland
conservation and biodiversity-friendly farming along the southern coast, an area with tourism
potential and globally important ecosystems. The Biodiversity Enabling Activity, financed by
GEF, i s building capacity in Governmental and nongovernmental sectors and supporting legal
and institutional reform t o improve efforts for the protection and sustainable use o f biodiversity.
Lastly, during this C A S period. a GEF financed project for phase out o f use o f ozone depleting
substances was supported, and implementation performance substantially improved.
Energy and Infrastructure

16.
Reform of the energy sector in Ukraine represents one o f the greatest challenges. The
approach during this C A S period has been to combine emphasis o n thematic and sector issues.

Attachment 1
Page 24 o f 32

E S W currently underway will provide the foundation for an integrated approach to energy issues
in the future.

17.
Electricity. Advances in the electricity sector have been made through improvements in
cash payments and clearer property rights--distribution privatization--and regulation. PAL
supported these efforts. The Bank has also kept an active dialogue with the Government, both
directly and as part a donor group involving the IMF, the EBRD, and U S A I D . Donors have
assisted the Government o n a variety o f areas, including providing privatization advisory
services. Currently, to further enhance financial discipline and property rights, the Government
prepares an action plan to reprogram financial debts among the agents in the sector and with
Government, which should help privatization in the sector. M o s t importantly, the efforts during
this C A S period will allow the Government to develop a comprehensive strategy for the
electricity sector.
18.
Coal. Coal’s economic importance and difficult financial situation led to early Bank
support t o Ukraine with one adjustment and one pilot lending operations during the previous C A S
period. During this C A S period, the Bank intended to continuing support for mine closures
through an operation designed to help re-deploy labor in the m a i n coal area--the Donbas region.
As the Government called o f f the policy o f mine closures and proceeded to extend budgetary
support to the mines, the operation was cancelled. However, the dialogue has been continued
through ESW, which has been completed and ready for discussions with the Government. If this
dialogue leads to a meeting o f minds and a sustainable coal sector strategy emerges, Bank
cooperation can intensify again. According to the client survey, coal sector reform i s one o f the
most controversial topics in Ukraine and where the Bank i s overly associated with a mine closure
policy. An open and transparent dialogue with the Government, miners, and c i v i l and the
development o f a fully owned strategy would do m u c h to improve the social economic conditions
in the sector and the region, and set straight the position and role o f the Bank.
19.
Gas. The gas sector has traditionally presented significant challenges to reform and B a n k
assistance. The dependence o n imported oil, Ukraine’s role as m a i n transit country for gas t o
Europe, and the dominant position o f N A F T A G A S , have a l l combined to create a situation o f
powerful vested interests. PAL support for financial discipline and increasing cash payments has
been the first step. PAL emphasis o n auditing N A F T A G A S and i t s different subsidiaries has
arisen f r o m the need to improve the knowledge base before launching a reform effort. This route,
however, has proceeded slowly. A recent hopeful advance has come through PAL’Sthematic
emphasis o n public sector accountability. The Government i s n o w conscious o f the need to
develop a sustainable strategy for N A F T A G A S and increase i t s accountability.
20.
Water. During this C A S period, the State Committee f o r Housing and Communal
Services (SCHCS), the central Government agency responsible f o r the water and wastewater
sector, has been preparing a sector strategy, with the support o f Danish bilateral assistance, and
consultation with other donors. A f i r s t draft o f the report i s expected to be submitted by the
consultants soon. This strategy should serve to define future modes o f cooperation. The B a n k
also supported the city of Lviv with a Water and Wastewater Project, a Bank loan o f U S D 24.25
million, approved by the Bank’s Board o n June 5,2001. The QAG carried out a Quality at Entry
Assessment in August 2001, and the overall rating for the project was satisfactory (2).

Private Sector Development
21.
The Bank and the IFC have actively supported Ukraine’s efforts to create an evenplaying field and low-transaction costs environment for business, in this and the previous C A S
periods. *. Surveys show that the quality o f the business environment as improved. The number
EDALsI&II

Attachment 1
Page 25 o f 32

of SMEs has increased. The Bank has maintain an active policy dialogue in the context o f the
PAL and a Private Sector Development L o a n was approved by the Board o n M a r c h 28, 2002.
This operation creates competitive mechanisms for regions to access resources based o n
improvements o f the business environment. Periodic surveys will monitor the evolution of the
business environment, and seek to identify areas o f further attention.
22.
Large scale privatization in Ukraine resumed during this C A S period, with emphasis o n
quality rather than resources mobilized. The privatization o f 6 electricity distribution companies
has been the most salient transaction. UKRTELECOM privatization i s expected when an
adequate regulatory framework i s in place and market conditions improve. A first external
review o f the privatization process, under PAL-I, showed that transparency had increased; but, a
posterior review shows n o further additional progress. The Government has presented to the
RADA what i s expected to be the last Privatization Program. The Bank supported the effort.
During this period, the government has tended to overestimate privatization proceeds,
complicating fiscal policy and postponing the need for true expenditure and tax reform.
23.
Progress in corporate governance has been slow. The m a i n shortcomings have been the
lack o f a modern L a w o n Joint Stock Companies, and the loose management o f state owned
enterprises. A recently completed ROC o n corporate governance sets the basis for a renewed
dialogue with the stakeholders. PAL has supported the Government’s intention to seek WTO
membership, and an external grant f r o m the Dutch Government goes partly to support this effort.
The Bank’s supporting role has been oriented to improve the understanding o f the likely
consequences o f membership and the institutional strengthening that i s required (customs,
certification, etc). The Bank has also emphasized the need to improve consultation and
communication with the public. Foreign direct investment picked up in the last t w o years, but
remains at very l o w levels.
Agriculture

24.
The Government implemented an aggressive strategy in the sector anchored o n two
critical actions: (a) the transfer o f the property first to collectives and then to farmers; and (b) the
removal o f the Government f r o m the sale o f inputs and the purchase o f outputs. On both i t was
successful. The L a n d Code was passed, private land ownership was legalized, and land
certificates were issued. The pace o f farm restructuring has been faster than expected; n o w more
than 2 m i l l i o n land titles have been issued. A land leasing market has developed, a major factor
in the improvement in the performance in the grain sector. Rental income i s a major source o f
income for the rural population. At the same time, agriculture output and yields per hectare have
increased.
25.
The Bank i s supporting directly these efforts with the L a n d Title and Cadastre
Development Project, approved by the Board in FY03. The project will finance the completion
o f the rural titling program (4 m i l l i o n additional titles) and the development o f a cadastre and
registry system. The Bank n o w supports, under PAL-2, the preparation o f a Cadastre/Registry
Law, the Mortgage Law, and other laws. The Mortgage l a w has been submitted to the Rada and
approved in M a y 2003. Setting up o f a unified property and titling registry in the country has
been unnecessarily slow because o f political wrangling between the agencies that so far have
provided partial services. Recently, the President issued a decree mandating the creation o f a
unified real state registry. The Cabinet o f Ministries will prepare the corresponding l a w to be
sent to the consideration o f the Rada.
26.
The direct intervention o f Government in agricultural markets has been reduced
significantly. Almost all o f Government input supply programs have been eliminated, as have
been local Government interventions in the movement o f grain. The compulsory registration of
grain transactions f o r domestic sales was removed. Subsidies were removed using an innovative

Attachment 1
Page 26 o f 32

mechanisms that transfer the cost o f the subsidy to the budget away f r o m the commercial banks.
Subsidies have significantly been phased out. The Rural Finance Project, to be delivered to the
Board in FY04, plans to develop the legal and institutional framework for secure transactions in
movable property, which will require the development o f the corresponding registry. The L a n d
Title and Cadastre Development Project will deal with immovable assets and their collateral.
including the development o f movable and unmovable collateral registries. This should help
develop a medium and long-term credit market, and solve the problem o f short-term credit
histories.
27.
Bank assistance during this period has been based o n lessons drawn f r o m earlier
interventions. The policy dialogue under the 200 1-2003 C A S focused o n selected priority
constraints to the development o f the sector, with more realistic timetables set for
implementation. The more focused approach and a higher level o f attention by Government o n
these priority issues has led t o more effective implementation and achievement o f goals. The
Bank, together with U S A I D and DFID, financed the Policy Analysis Unit o f the Council o f the
Cabinet o f Ministers for the whole C A S period, f i r s t as the Capacity Building Initiative (FYO1)
and then through an IDF grant. This approach, involving Ukrainian policy analysts, has been
more effective than previous efforts, which relied o n the policy analysis by the Bank or working
though existing policy institutes. Lastly, the Bank jointly with the OECD and the policy analysis
unit, i s undertaking a review o f the agricultural and rural sector policies in Ukraine. This study,
n o w in draft form, will help enrich the sector strategy and broaden the policy dialogue to include
issues such as technology and rural development.
Financial

28.
Advances made under the P A L agenda have paved the way for improved financial sector
performance and further institutional progress. The Bank has supported the sector through an
active financial policy dialogue. Improved financial discipline, virtual elimination o f barter, and
a more stable macro situation have significantly increased the size o f the financial system as
percentage o f GDP.2 However, the financial sector continues to be small and encumbered by
thematic issues, specifically the weak judicial sector that makes i t very difficult to enforce
contracts.
29.
Advances have also been made in setting up an adequate legal basis for the development
o f the sector. Significant have been the L a w o n National Bank o f Ukraine (1999), the L a w o n
Banks and Banking Activity (2000), the L a w o n Financial Services and State Regulation o f
Financial Services Markets( July 2001), and the L a w o n Insurance (October 2001). These laws
have been supplemented by a large number o f other laws, presidential decrees, National Bank
Directives and other normative provisions, resulting in a more comprehensively regulated
financing system. The Bank supported the development o f these initiatives through the Financial
Sector Structural Adjustment L o a n in the previous CAS. In FYO1, the B a n k completed E S W
titled “Ukraine. Financial Sector and the Economy: The New Policy Agenda. This has been
considered a most useful publication and s t i l l being discussed in Ukraine. The piece o f E S W
was reviewed by QAG and graded highly satisfactory. Under PAL, the Bank n o w continues to
support the further development o f the regulatory agenda, including the non-banking financial
system. In December 2002, the Non-Banking Financial Insurance Regulator (NBFIR) was
established by Presidential Decree and i t s Chairman appointed. Another major achievement has
been removal of the license for Bank Ukraina, whose liquidation proceeds o n a timely basis. The
Bank n o w supports the restructuring o f the Savings Bank, the largest bank and a public
institution, to forestall both substantial fiscal and financial consequences. In particular, the Bank

APPENDIX E: CIVIL SOCIETY INITIATIVES

1.
Ukraine i s one o f the few ECA countries where the W o r l d B a n k has engaged in a
relatively systematic way o n c i v i l society issues, by supporting a wide spectrum o f c i v i l society
activities ranging f r o m advocacy to public education and oversight o f local and regional
governments activities. The Bank has also encouraged the involvement o f CSOs in social service
delivery projects and supported NGO coalition building initiatives and public consultations.
W o r k with c i v i l society began as part o f the drafting o f the W o r l d Bank’s Strategy o f Assistance
to Ukraine (CAS) in 2000. Currently, the activities o f the W o r l d Bank’s Ukraine Country Team
are geared specifically to enhancing the participation and capacity o f non-Governmental actors in
the country with the objective o f working with them as partners in the reform process. This
appendix reviews direct initiatives o f the Bank working with c i v i l society during the last C A S
period.
2.
The People’s Voice Project (November 1999-present). The largest initiative for civic
engagement in terms o f total disbursements and scope i s the People’s Voice Project (PVP),
funded by the W o r l d Bank Institute (WBI), the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA), and other donors. The project (USD $1,200,000 million) i s executed under the W o r l d
Bank’s supervision. Recently the Canadian Government provided financing for the next four
years - the second stage o f the project implementation.

3.
The PVP seeks to enhance the quality o f governance by supporting local reform
initiatives and by monitoring the delivery o f local services through the establishment o f NGO
coalitions. The pilot cities f o r the first stage were Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kupyansk and
Chuguiv. The project will be scale-up f r o m four to six cities. The scope o f activities includes
monitoring the delivery o f public services, developing municipal policy initiatives and facilitating
practices that foster civic engagement, such as public hearings, “report cards”, community
advisory councils, and citizens’ charters.

4.
Local CSOs receive substantial support in order to implement activities in the spheres o f
gender, education, communal housing and utilities payment, mostly aiming to improve public
accountability. The results o f these activities are presented to local administrators (regional and
municipal administration mostly), who can critically assess the needs o f local citizens and
businesses in formulating public policy. The information gathered through the project i s also
provided to the central authorities.
5.
Strengthening Accountability through Dialogue and Improved Legal Environment
for Civic Participation (February 2002-March 2004). This project i s financed by a Bank’s twoyear grant o f $288,000 given to the Ministry o f Economy and European Integration.. I t s purpose
i s twofold. First, the project i s to support and expand the dialogue between Government and c i v i l
society for better exchange of accurate information, transparency and accountability o f a l l actors
active in implementation o f the social and economic reforms. Second, the project should promote
legislation that would increase the capacity o f third sector to provide services and facilitate the
transition to self-sustainability.
6.
As o f today, the project team has launched i t s web site (http://www,dialog.me,gov,ua)
and started developing a communication strategy for the Ministry o f Economy and European
Integration. A set o f 23 TV programs o n budget issues has been produced in cooperation with the
Ministry of Finance and shown o n one o f the top Ukrainian TV channels in summer 2002. In
September -October 2002 a series o f public hearing o n the EU accession has been held by the
Ministry o f Economy in different regions o f Ukraine.
7.
Country Innovation Day and Knowledge Forum. The f i r s t Country Innovation D a y
as a part o f the Global Development Marketplace took place in Kyiv in June 200 1. M o r e than

460 ideas were presented to the jury, which selected fifteen winners f r o m a p o o l o f 42 finalists.
The winning projects covered a wide range o f issues, including an Internet portal to disseminate
information about the spread o f TB in Ukraine, the creation o f a Children’s Cultural and
Education Center to involve a new generation o f Ukrainians in building a new vision for the
country or promotion o f the n e w environmental approach t o the land cultivation. This competition
culminated by the Knowledge Forum, which served the innovation promotion and sharing as well
as the best practice exchange among participants f r o m Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. .

learning course f o r NGOs o n h o w to become a strong partner for the Government and business
was developed within the “Social partnership- a paradigm of success ” Project. Forty five NGOs
and fifteen Govemment representatives f r o m Belarus, M o l d o v a and Ukraine were selected to
participate in this course. Educational materials o n various modules have been developed by
trainers
and

9.
The Knowledge Forum that took place in Kyiv o n M a y 19-22, 2002, was a continuation
o f the distance leaming phase. I t convened about 65 NGOs and local Government representatives
f r o m Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova. I t has provided a space for knowledge and experience sharing
about crucial and current issues relevant to a l l three countries.
10.
“Side By Side” World Bank Informational Bulletin for NGOs (December 2001 present). “Side By Side” i s a quarterly Informational Bulletin, circulation 1200 copies (1000-in
Ukrainian and 200 in English), dedicated to the partnership between Ukrainian non-profit
organizations and the W o r l d Bank. I t includes information about the W o r l d Bank projects, NGOs
activity, interviews with NGO and Government representatives and success stories f r o m the
winners o f the Country Innovation D a y and Small Grants Program.

11.
The Small Grants Program. The m a i n objective o f the Program i s “to support the
empowerment of citizens to have greater ownership o f development processes, thereby making
these processes more inclusive and equitable.” This program has gained momentum in Ukraine,
promoting dialogue among NGOs and dissemination o f information o n development, social
partnership, and citizens engagements. The presentations o f winners have been organized and the
mass media coverage was solid.

12.
NGO Contact Group (Spring 2000 - present). During the preparation o f the W o r l d
Bank C A S 2000 to Ukraine the Bank team consulted with over 200 representatives o f NGOs,
community groups, and business circles. During these consultations, a group o f NGOs decided to
participate more actively not only helping the Bank design the strategy f o r Ukraine, but also
providing feedback o n i t s implementation. Together, they established the “NGO Contact Group”
for the W o r l d Bank. The Contact Group i s n o w operating as a voluntary consultative body, to
make sure that the interests o f NGOs are taken into consideration in a l l W o r l d Bank projects
implemented in Ukraine. The Contact Group has currently twelve members. Membership in the
group i s very flexible and voluntary. Any public associations, network or NGO f r o m all oblasts
o f Ukraine can become members o f the Contact Group. Other tasks o f the Contact Group include:
(a) Informing the W o r l d Bank about third sector trends and activities; (b) providing comments o n
the W o r l d Bank’s policies in Ukraine; (c) providing feedback o n the individual W o r l d Bank
projects; (d)Identifying possibilities for NGO involvement at different stages o f the Bank’s
project cycle; and, (e) facilitating the participation o f regional NGOs in these tasks by
disseminating information o n the W o r l d Bank activities and programs.
13.
The NGO Tax Amendment Project (2002-2002). The project was initiated in the
Summer o f 2001 and only partially implemented by the end o f June o f 2002. I t s m a i n purpose
was to mobilize the c i v i l society actors to lobby for a better NGO legislation, i.e. the third sector

tax-exempted status, incentives for citizens to donate money, and to define a l i s t o f missionrelated economic activities allowed for the third sector to perform. A special study was prepared
by the International Center for Non-Profit L a w and funded by the World Bank in the Spring o f
2001, published in summer 2002 , and a representative working group was created and started i t s
work in the Summer o f 2001. In addition, the World Bank had given a small grant to the
Counterpart Creative Center in Kyiv to initiate the civil society mobilization, training, and
preparing a l i s t o f mission-related economic activities for the third sector actors by the end o f
2001. The CCC’s report was released in July o f 2002. Lack o f coordination among participants
brought the project to a halt.

1.
A rapid review o f the portfolio o f the Bank’s projects in Ukraine indicates that several
elements o f civic engagement have been internalized in the project cycle and that a number o f
initiatives underway have brought good results. Project preparation across the portfolio has
included a solid attempt in understanding beneficiary needs in the context o f project objectives.
In most case, such efforts, usually l e d by Bank staff, to identify stakeholders and their interests
through such exercises have been useful for determining the scope and nature o f civic
engagement.

2.
In addition, many o f the projects, and particularly in Lviv Water and Wastewater Supply
Project, have included information dissemination to beneficiaries as a major civic engagement
strategy. The TB/HIV A I D S Project, particularly in i t s HIV A I D S component, has planned a
media campaign about HIV AIDS, while the SIF has public information and education subcomponents for building public support for community-based social services and project
implementation. W h i l e a l l the projects have regular consultations with their constituent clients,
the SIF and H I V / A I D S projects incorporated well-articulated institutional structures for
stakeholder participation. Capacity building, on the other hand, could b e further developed in the
SIF and H I V / A I D S projects. Although they rely on donors for this, uncertainties remain as to
which donors will come through with adequate support for training NGOs in service delivery.
Economic and sector w o r k has also included c i v i l society participation. The Gender

situation as w e l l as the role o f women in c i v i l society in Ukraine. The Environmental Public
Expenditure Review (completed in October 2002) has been the first attempt at a public assessment
of Government expenditures o n environmental protection. During a first stage, focus groups
were held, and a l l suggestions and comments expressed in the focus groups were generalized and
submitted in the f o r m o f recommendations to the project working group. The consultation
concluded with a roundtable, attended by representatives o f three focus groups and by responsible
officials f r o m ministries and agencies.

Challenges that impeded greater civic engagement in the projects, and next steps
4.
The SIF project team identified a challenge that i s common across E C A - h o w to
evaluate NGOs and determine whose voices -- if any -- they represent. This shared dilemma
suggests that any project involving NGOs could benefit f r o m a Capacity Assessment o f local
NGOs. A further lesson that emerges f r o m the difficulties o f working with NGOs i s this that an
ongoing analysis o f c i v i l society actors, interest and incentives i s important for fine-tuning
projects’ participatory frameworks.

5.
The complications experienced by the Lviv Water and Wastewater project demonstrates
the slow paralysis that could potentially retard projects not backed by locall national political
commitment. Implicit in the project design are several reform elements such as improvement in
collections, re-design o f targeted subsidies, and formation o f condominium associations. The
project team needs to understand whether the Government i s in fact committed to reform at the
city level by undertaking an ongoing analysis o f the local political economy. With this issue
clarified, the next step in the project’s civic engagement strategy would be to f o r m an alliance
with c i v i l society to push for reform.

6.
The Private Sector Development Project team also identified limited cooperation f r o m
vested oblast administrations responsible for regulating business activities as a reason f o r slow
progress in the project. The lack o f support has also resulted in part f r o m the difficulty in
articulating attractive incentives for oblast officials to support reforms. A civic engagement
strategy o f working with selected NGOs to publicly disseminate information about progress (or
lack thereof) in project could mobilize more public support by amplifying voices demanding
better corporate governance.
7.
Although the H I V / A I D S project has actively made use o f most opportunities for civic
engagement, the team i s s t i l l concerned about possible controversies due to limited funding for
ARV drugs. One way o f mitigating or at least balancing the controversy may be by greater
involvement o f PLHA in the project through participatory monitoring, especially regarding the
out-of-pocket expenses, public and professional attitudes toward them, and treatment.

WORLD BANKSTRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
OF C I V I L SOCIETY

A. Forms o f Civil Engagement under Previous and Present CAS
Civic Engagement under the Previous CAS

1.
Ukraine i s one o f the few ECA countries in which the W o r l d Bank has already
systematically supported a wide spectrum o f c i v i l society activities ranging from
advocacy to public education and oversight o f local and regional governments. The Bank
has also supported civil society organization (CSO) involvement in social service
delivery projects, NGO coalition building initiatives and public consultations (see B o x A
for a rationale for such interventions). W o r k with civil society began with the drafting
2000 CAS. Currently, an important focus o f the Ukraine Country Team is enhancing the
participation and capacity o f non-governmental actors in the reform process. The
following summarizes the direct initiatives o f the Bank’s engagement with c i v i l society
during the last CAS period.

2.
Non Lending Activities. Direct programs during this C A S period have included
the creation o f an NGO contact group; the setting up o f the Institutional Development
Fund (Dialogue for Reforms); organizing the Innovation D a y andKnowledge Forum;
publishing and distributing an NGO bulletin; the establishment o f a Small Grants
Program; and the continuation o f the People’s Voice project.

3.
The Small Grants Program funds c i v i l society organizations in promoting
dialogue and disseminating information on development, social partnership, and citizen’s
engagements. For example, one such project funded under this program seeks to improve
social and legal protections at the community level and creates new ways o f interacting
with municipal authorities. The c i v i l society activists and applicants o f the Small Grants
Program view the program as successful and necessary for Ukraine. The increase in the
number o f applicants for the grants over the years indicates a strong interest in the
program. The NGO contact group, when established in the fall o f 2000, was a unique
experience in Ukraine. Participants have found an open forum to consider a broad range
o f issues, including strategies to strengthen c i v i l society, tax treatment o f NGOs, the role
o f the Bank in c i v i l society issues in Ukraine, etc. The Ministry o f Economy i s
considering establishing a Civil Society Advisory Group patterned o n the NGO contact
group.

4.
The Dialogue for Reform Project (Februauy 2002-March 2004) i s financed by a
Bank’s two-year grant o f $288,000 given to the Ministry o f Economy as an implementing
agency. I t s purpose is twofold. First, the project i s expected to support the dialogue
between Government and c i v i l society that will facilitate exchange o f information,
transparency and accountability o f all actors active in implementation o f the social and
economic reforms. Second, the project i s expected to promote legislation that would

(www.dialog.me.gov.ua) has been launched; twenty-three video program series o n
budget issues has been produced and broadcasted in cooperation with the Ministry o f
Finance and the I C T V ; and a series o f public hearings o n the EU accession has been
organized in different parts o f Ukraine by the Ministry o f Economy.

Box A : The Role o f Civic Engagement in Enhancing Service Provision and Government Accountability
Globally, new forms o f engagement have emerged between citizens and the state to challenge assumptions that
govemment accountability can be guaranteed by democratic elections alone, or through “horizontal
accountability,” the process whereby public officials and agencies report “sideways” to other officials. These
new forms o f engagement are typified by the participation o f community groups, NGOs, and citizens in setting
and pursuing broad societal goals. There are a number o f ways in which c i v i l society engagement can reinforce
the structures o f accountability that characterize good government. Monitoring by civil society, augmented by
citizen feedback on public services, signals the government and i t s agencies areas where they need to increase
accountability. In addition to exerting pressure from outside govemment, c i v i l society can participate directly in
govemment institutions by taking o n the responsibility for official executive oversight. C i v i l society can also
directly serve the poor, who are critically interested in service provision, by taking o n responsibility for social
service delivery, especially when state resources and capacity are over-stretched, and where local knowledge and
community involvement are especially important.
State and civil society actors play complementary roles in bringing about civic engagement. In some cases,
states actively facilitate the participation o f civil society; in other cases, c i v i l society must exert pressure on the
state to open spaces for i t s participation. The most productive results occur, however, when both parties
cooperate to identify avenues for civil society participation. In Ukraine today, there appear to be conditions for
an alliance between reform-minded public officials and strong civil society organizations in the interest of
increasing govemment accountability. The Ukrainian Government has articulated a medium-term agenda that
calls for developing a middle class; guaranteeing a framework o f human rights and freedoms, improving
environmental sustainability; reducing regional imbalances; and strengthening transparency and accountability.
This agenda provides a framework for linking citizen voice and responsive govemment, as well as specific entry
points for civic engagement activities.

5.
The Innovation Day/ Knowledge Forum were organized in 2001 and 2002. I t s
purpose i s to award grants to projects designed by citizens and local groups that build
local development capacity, expertise, networking, and citizens empowerment. The
projects are selected for grant o n a competitive basis. The event i s combined with the
Knowledge Forum where knowledge, experiences and best practices are exchanged
between participants from Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. The first ID (June 2001)
attracted more than 460 brief proposals out o f which 15 were awarded grants. The 2002
Knowledge Forum centered o n the Distant Learning Course “Social Partnership--A
Paradigm for Success”. I t was a three-country event (Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus), which
attracted 45 NGO activists and 15 government officials as the course participants. A total
o f 65 people took part in the Knowledge Forum where the participants presented their
case studies. These events have provided NGOs in the region opportunities to develop
their networks and to learn f r o m others.

6.

The initiative t o periodically publish and distribute the NGO Bulletin began in
December 2001 as an effort to enhance communication between the WE3 and civil
society. I t provides information o n WE3 activities, projects, and events, and also other
current and coming c i v i l society events. The Bulletin has been w e l l received by the NGO
community, which considers it an important information source. Twelve hundred copies
(Ukrainian language 1000 and in English 200) o f Bulletin i s produced and distributed by
the Bank on a quarterly basis.

7.
The People’s Voice Project (PVP) i s a pioneer o f c i v i l society involvement in
Ukraine and in the region. The People’s Voice project, focused on Ternopil and Ivano
Frankivsk, was designed as a pilot program under the umbrella o f the Ukraine anticorruption program supported by the W o r l d Bank and the Canadian International

Attachment 2
Page 3 o f 10

Development Agency (CIDA). This pilot project was managed by the International
Centre for Policy Studies (ICPS) and several local partners within Ukraine, beginning in
1999. The primary objective o f the project was to assist selected cities in Ukraine to
reform and improve the quality o f their municipal services to households and businesses.
The project also sought to strengthen capabilities o f both citizen groups and officials in
using information and interacting with each other in order to improve the overall quality
o f governance in these cities.

8.
The f i r s t phase o f the People’s Voice Project was completed in October, 2002.
The interventions used in the project included survey data o n public satisfaction with
municipal services and local govemment responsiveness; public hearings, consultations,
information campaigns; training programs and conferences for NGOs; Municipal Policy
Training Program for local government officials; study tours for municipal policy
trainees to observe education and communal service reforms in Lithuania and Poland;
and knowledge sharing and communication between pilot sites.

9.

An evaluation o f the PVP has revealed that the first phase o f the People’s Voice
Project has had significant impacts in the pilot sites in mobilizing the local public, in
establishing NGO coordination, and in improving communication and information f l o w
between local administration and citizens. The evaluation revealed specific impacts
including improved attitudes o f municipal officials toward NGOs and citizen
involvement; continuation o f initiatives regarding communal housing, education, utility
payment centers and transportation, implementation o f some new policies, statutes and
orders, soliciting o f citizen feedback and input through public hearings, consultations,
and plans for further surveys from municipalities; and an increase in transparency o f local
govemment decision-making as evidenced by budget hearings and public hearings.

10. Lending Activities. A review o f the portfolio o f projects indicates that several
elements o f civic engagement have been intemalized in the project cycle and that a
number o f initiatives underway have brought good results. Project preparation across the
portfolio has included a solid attempt in understanding beneficiary needs in the context o f
project objectives. In most case, such efforts, usually led by Bank staff, to identify
stakeholders and their interests through such exercises have been useful for determining
the scope and nature o f civic engagement. In addition, many o f the projects, and
particularly in Lviv Water and Wastewater Supply Project, have included information
dissemination to beneficiaries as a major civic engagement strategy. The T B / H I V - A I D S
Project, particularly in i t s HIV-AIDS component, has planned a media campaign about
HIV-AIDS, while the Social Investment Fund Project has public information and
education sub-components for building public support for community-based social
services and project implementation. While all the projects have regular consultations
with their constituent clients, less projects have incorporated well-articulated institutional
structures for stakeholder participation. Capacity building, too, could be further
developed in the SIF and HIV/AIDS projects. Although they rely on donors for this,
uncertainties remain as to which donors will come through with adequate support for
training NGOs in service delivery. Some o f the challenges that have impeded greater
civic engagement in the projects, include h o w to evaluate NGOs and determine whose
voices they represent, an ongoing assessment o f the local political economy

considerations, and identification o f strategies and coalitions to support the underlying
reforms supported by Bank projects.

Civic Engagement under the new CAS
11.
The civic engagement strategy in the current C A S has been selective in i t s
approach. The strategy has taken shape as a result o f several workshops and discussions
by the World Bank staff working on Ukraine. I t s objectives are two-fold: (i)
it seeks to
help the government in attaining i t s objectives o f transparency and accountability; and
(ii)
it also seeks to build consensus with vocal external actors around the Bank agenda
and activities and maintain dialogue with external stakeholders to better understand the
local situation. These objectives o f the civic engagement strategy are linked to the
proposed C A S objectives o f facilitating an inclusive and responsive government, the
strengthening o f the c i v i l society, and increase in accountability o f public officials.
Given the importance o f a strong civil society for enhancing government accountability
and inclusiveness, Bank activities for empowering civil society will continue to be an
important mainstay o f the forthcoming CAS. Program details are as follows:

12.
Non-lending activities. Non-lending activities have played a key role in fostering
the institutional reform agenda in Ukraine. As discussed in the C A S Completion Report,
such programs have evolved along three lines: (i)
providing voice to c i v i l society; (ii)
working directly with c i v i l society on selected initiatives with high demonstrative value;
using Bank projects to pilot alternative forms o f service delivery at the local
and (iii)
level. During the next C A S period, these three lines o f work will remain the main
strategic direction for Bank activities.
13.
Specifically, the NGO Contact Group has been an important forum for c i v i l
society groups to meet periodically; it has been a useful mechanism for improving the
support for NGOs with the government. I t i s clear that CSOs regard membership to the
contact group as a status symbol; however, the group will be made more effective and
representative by including members from outside Kiev; i t s mission w i l l be revised and
major tasks, better defined. Similarly, the N G O Bulletin will continue to be published;
be more widely circulated to reach local and central administration and regional NGOs;
and will be augmented with special thematic supplements. The Small Grants Program
will continue; a regular and thorough program evaluation o f i t s impact will also be
carried out. The criteria and procedure for the selection o f the winners o f the grants will
also be clarified.
The Innovation Day/ Knowledge Forum will also continue; more effort
will be put into defining the concept o f innovation in order to make the opportunity more
accessible to a wide spectrum o f CSOs with differing capacities and endowments. These
efforts are key to improving Bank - c i v i l society relationship, maintaining dialogue with
external stakeholders, and in building wide support for Bank programs.

14.
The People’s Voice Project will enter i t s second phase; it will scale up to six new
cities the activities, mechanisms, and procedures that promote public participation in
building an effective, responsible and open government at the municipal level. Some o f
the innovations that may be included in the second phase are a more aggressive program
for sharing lessons learned and joint problem solving between project cities and other
cities in Ukraine; early discussions between municipal policy officials, NGO pilot
coordinators, and the media; training for municipal policy working group members in

Attachment 2
Page 5 o f 10

policy implementation; and training for N G O coalition members in the policy reform
process and in basic local government operations. The project has also great synergy
with the Dialogue for Reforms Project that supports Government commitment to consult
reform initiatives, obtain feedback, and involve c i v i l society actors in the execution and
monitoring o f public programs. These projects will likely jointly formulate action plans
to use PVP’s sites and establish networks as pilots for the IDF’s N G O development
component. Furthermore, both the PVP and the Dialogue for Reforms project will seek
synergies with the P A L team to jointly define a set o f activities to monitor and evaluate
the PAL program. I t i s expected that these efforts at designing systemic mechanisms for
citizen feedback o n government programs, and providing information to citizens o n
public issues and policies, will improve governance and government accountability.

15.
Lending activities. During CAS implementation, the first priority will be given to
the full implementation o f ongoing programs, particularly a number o f those that have
become effective only recently. O f these, the SIF, the TB/HIV-AIDS, the STAMP, the
L a n d Titling and the E-Development projects are expected to yield substantial
improvements in k e y areas o f reform. Whether the indicator to be monitored consists o f
community satisfaction with community and social care services (SIF); consumer
satisfaction with water services and tariff level (Lviv Water Supply and Sanitation
project), or the quality o f health care (TB/ H I V - A I D S project), participatory monitoring
clearly emerges as a way o f intensifying civic engagement that can strengthen all o f the
projects in the portfolio. For example, one way o f balancing the controversy over limited
funding for ARV drugs may be by greater involvement o f people-living-with- HIV and
A I D S in participatory monitoring o f the project, especially regarding the out-of-pocket
expenses, public and professional attitudes toward them, and treatment. While the basic
principle o f participatory monitoring i s that primary stakeholders are active participants
and not just sources o f information, it also builds the capacity o f local people for analysis.
16.
A number o f new lending operations in support o f institutional reform in key
areas are intended to lead to improvements in services delivered to the population as well
as result in greater accountability o f public officials. By strengthening institutional
capacity to collect and process timely and accurate data, the Statistical Improvements for
Results Monitoring Project (FY04, US$30 million) will make available trustworthy social
and economic statistics needed for policy making and monitoring; i t s poverty mapping
exercise will help in identifying poverty-targeted project opportunities. The impact o f
these will be lending and investment decisions in the country based o n data that reflect
concrete/ genuine actual reality as well as increased accountability o f policy makers.
17.
The Equal Access to Quality Education Project (FY05, US$80 million) will
contribute to improving accountability through outreach programs that inform parents
about school quality; through involving parent-teacher associations in planning school
quality improvements; and participation o f CS groups in the monitoring and evaluation o f
project-supported activities. I t will engage c i v i l society in improving education sector
policies by gathering their feedback on local impact o f education strategies; and it seeks
to improve delivery o f services by involving CSOs in developing teaching materials and
student assessments and in the training o f teachers.
18.
The Energy APL that has been agreed as a concept will need to be developed
depending on the results o f the ongoing dialogue. I t m a y have t w o components, one

addressing coal sector reforms and two, addressing power sector reforms. Given the
centrality o f coal subsidies to the functioning o f the sector, the project would have a
strong component o n strengthening governance, accountability and transparency in the
use of these public funds, including establishing more clear institutional structures to
ensure that decisions are made that are consistent with local needs and priorities,
particularly with respect to the transfer o f social assets in mining towns; and in ensuring
that the revision o f the existing mine closure plans adequately reflect the priorities o f the
affected mining communities and in keeping with the limited resources available.
Depending o n the results o f the ongoing policy dialogue, a Health Reform project may
materialize during the C A S period, which will include on-going consultations with civil
society at each stage o f project preparation, and engaging c i v i l society in client
satisfaction assessments and participatory monitoring and evaluation.

19.
Thus, the approach for engaging CS through lending and non-lending activities in
Ukraine i s two-pronged. Through lending activities that involve NGOs in service
delivery, the Bank directly or indirectly assists them in advocating for policies that
directly target the poor. Through lending and non-lending activities, the Bank also helps
CSOs forge coalitions among themselves and with the govemment to push for better
governance and accountability. The strategy therefore holds promise for building up the
experience and know-how CSOs need to become credible players in the policy arena.
Moreover, it contributes to better governance by increasing autonomy, self-organization
and voice; improving effectiveness o f service delivery institutions and outcomes;
producing more relevant and reliable information.
20.
To ensure that lending activities involving civil society make the best use o f this
alliance, it i s necessary that Bank projects begin with a clear understanding o f the field.
Therefore, projects will conduct a Capacity Assessment o f the relevant c i v i l society
actors, interests and incentives for fine-tuning projects’ participatory frameworks. The
Kiev resident mission staff, including staff who are currently focused o n communication
initiatives and public meetings o n policy issues possess the requisite skills to conduct
such ongoing assessments. Second, to monitor the success o f the entire Ukraine portfolio
in further mainstreaming civic engagement, a serious and systematic mid-term evaluation
in the form o f an E S W will take place in FY05 with support from the social development
unit.

Conclusion

21.
The corporate rationale for the W o r l d Bank in investing in civic engagement i s
already well-known. The selective approach adopted in civic engagement strategy not
only requires a sufficiently strong and independent c i v i l society, but a govemment that i s
committed to the process. I t i s expected that the strategy will not only increase the
understanding and support o f citizens for policies and programs influencing their life, but
that it will contribute to the effectiveness and the quality o f development interventions
supported by the World Bank. Strengthened local ownership for government programs,
and improved sustainability of development programs through stronger participation o f
citizens will need to be periodically monitored and evaluated to ensure maximum
development impact.

B. CAS Consultations with Stakeholders
22.
This section presents a summary o f the consultations with the c i v i l society held
during C A S preparation. Within the framework o f the C A S consultations-and with full
support from Government, which has encouraged this open and participatory processBank staff met with over 500 representatives o f government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, academia, professional associations, think-tanks, business circles,
parliamentarians, members o f local governments and mass media.

23.
Participatory approach to the process o f elaborating the Ukraine C A S assumed the
following three components:
0

0

Acquiring feedback in order to highlight the perceptions o f various stakeholders
vis-A-vis the Bank and key issues,
Consultations with various stakeholders in an iterative process,
ClariJication o f objectives.

24.
All these components were implemented at various stages o f drafting C A S for
Ukraine.

Acquiring feedback. T o begin the CAS consultative process the Bank has sought
feedback from different groups o n i t s performance to date. A number o f tools
have been employed including: (a) Public Suwey was conducted using Focus
Group Methodology (7 focus groups were established in 4 cities o f Ukraine:

Kyiv, Lviv, Donetsk, Selidovo); (b) Client Suwey covered 80 respondents from
the Cabinet o f Ministers, National Bank, the Administration o f the President o f
Ukraine, other central government authorities and regional governments'.

25.
A special web-site has been set up in English, Ukrainian and Russian which
facilitated the consultation process by providing regular updates o f key information about
the CAS, posting minutes from relevant meetings, and summaries o f the feedback
received as well as by inviting the submission o f comments.
Consultations with various stakeholders.
The C A S was prepared with
government participation and consulted with other stakeholders, such as nongovernmental organizations, professional associations, the private sector, mass
media. The m a i n objective o f the inclusion o f the mentioned parties in the C A S
preparation i s to obtain information from diverse sources and to take into account
a wide range o f views coming from various parts o f the c i v i l society.

26.
An iterative procedure o f consultations with various stakeholders assumed that (i)
at all the stages o f C A S preparation the WB C A S team undertook intensive discussions
with the Government o f Ukraine, members o f Parliament, local governments,
representatives o f c i v i l society, academia and think-tanks to ensure that priorities o f the
WB strategy in Ukraine are broadly shared by various stakeholders, and (ii)
every next
iteration o f discussions allowed to clarify the set o f CAS objectives and priorities,
necessary policy and institutional changes as well as instruments to be used to pursue
further market transformations in Ukraine.

A series o f regional consultations were held during missions in October 27.
December 2002 in Kyiv, Odesa, Lviv, Poltava, Donetsk and a series o f brainstorming
sessions in February-March 2003 in Kyiv with the participation o f sector managers and
task team leaders who briefed those present on the respective sector strategies, on-going
or planned projects and programs, and instruments for their implementation. Written
comments on the proposed strategy were provided by a number o f think tanks and NGOs.
Background information about the proposed strategy was made available in Ukrainian
and circulated widely.
28.
As an integral part o f the new approach, thematic brainstorming sessions
covering major C A S sectors have been conducted. They were aimed at discussing the
most important sector problems, identifying policy and institutional changes needed to
address the problems, clarifying cross-cutting effects o f these changes and measurable
indicators to assess progress. The participants o f the brainstormings represented
government, businesses and NGOs.
29.
Though the format o f the brainstormings differed between different topics there
was some baseline format that was followed by all the sectors, General Discussion Work in Groups on different aspects of the issue - Presentation and General Discussion.
That allowed both to give participants an overall perspective o n the issue and go into the
details bringing expertise from government, businesses and NGOs. During the group
work participants defined main problems in the sector, followed by the prioritization o f
these problems. I t actually gave the Bank and participants quite different perspective,
allowing to see the most burning problems as well as those that are complementary and
are to be consequentially solved after some underlying problems are eliminated. The
next part o f the work in groups was to define the ways o f solving the major problems.
After the possible solutions were defined participants had to come up with sets o f
monitorable indicators. That, besides serving i t s direct purpose o f monitoring the policy
progress, introduced the government officials, who participated in the events, to some
type o f the policy-making framework that i s more result-oriented than what they are used
to. Also, to develop global vision o f the problem, participants had to consider intersectoral impact o f the policy actions suggested by them in their area.
30.
The brainstorming sessions were conducted in the following areas and the
following major issues were defined:

CZariJication of Objectives. Gradual clarification o f objectives, priorities and
directions o f institutional changes withidacross sectors presumed that every next
stage o f discussions would elucidate understanding o f both within the WB team
and with the Ukrainian Government o f development priorities and would allow to
achieve consensus along as many directions o f work as possible.

32.
The round-tables and brainstorming sessions generated great interest and attracted
a variety o f participants from organizations representing intellectuals, youth groups,
business professionals, the media, handicapped, disabled, retired, academicians, small
and medium enterprises, charities, scientific circles, environmentalists, etc. The thematic
discussions focused o n the most pertinent issues o f the reform agenda: poverty
alleviation, human development, social welfare, environmental protection, good
governance, legal system and private sector development. Participants appreciated the
fact that they could freely express their concerns, provide information and give
suggestions directly to representatives o f the W o r l d Bank.
33.
The meetings were open, selection o f invitees was random and totally unbiased o n
the part o f the Bank, and the conference rooms during all meetings were packed to
capacity testifying to the interest in the discussions. International donors and government
officials were also invited to attend. Written comments were also solicited. Comments
received and their posting on the web-site assured full transparency and accessibility.

Box B: Results o f Public and Client Surveys
Acquiring feedback at the very beginning o f the CAS consultative process the Bank has sought feedback from
different groups on its performance to date.

A Public Survey that was conducted using Focus Group Methodology. 7 focus groups were established in 4
cities o f Ukraine: Kyiv, Lviv, Donetsk, Selidovo (Donetsk Region). Respondents represented following subgroups: civil servants (city administrations, local councils etc).; mass media; businessmen; scientists, researches,
lawyers, teachers; public organizations (youth associations, professional communities, women organizations).
The results o f the survey show that a vast majority o f the respondents have rather superficial and frequently
incorrect knowledge about the essence o f the Bank’s mission and activities, the principles underlying it, or
individual projects that i t supports. The overall extent o f knowledge o f P A L demonstrated by the focus group
members was extremely low. Only a few respondents had previously heard about that program and were able to
say some general words about its essence. During the last two years, the respondents’ overall attitude towards
the World Bank has undergone certain changes, as one could see from an increase (2002 vs. 2000) in the
number o f unfavorable statements about the Bank as an international organization, and about some individual
programs implemented w i t h its support. Nevertheless, the results o f the study indicate that most o f the
respondents are aware o f the need for market transformations in the country. I t i s acknowledged that economic
reforms are indeed under way, although their efficiency has been l o w so far. All the statements made by
proponents o f market reform demonstrated their understanding that the W o r l d Bank i s interested in a markettype transformation o f the country’s economic life, and that it uses its financial resources to support the most
promising sectors o f the Ukrainian economy.
A Client Survey covered 80 respondents from the Cabinet o f Ministers, National Bank, the Administration o f the
President o f Ukraine, other central government authorities and regional governments. Sample includes state
officials o f different level and different spheres o f professional activities. The results o f the survey show that
most o f the respondents worked on the preparation o f the project documents or participated in the negotiations
with the W o r l d Bank for more than 3 years. Overall efficiency and consistency o f the W o r l d Bank work with
the needs o f Ukraine was evaluated as efficient and useful. Discrepancies in approaches o f the Bank and the
Government to implementation o f the projects was pointed out as one o f the major problems together with the
political instability in Ukraine. The other issue o f a concern that was stated was that preparation o f the World
Bank’s projects on average became slower. The assessment o f the work o f the Ukrainian W o r l d Bank office
and the World Bank officials was very favorable.

This feedback has highlighted a number o f issues which the team maintained to pursue through ongoing
consultations and finally they were reflected in the Ukraine CAS 2004-2007.

UKRAINE: RELATIONS WITH THE IMF

1.
Ukraine joined the IMF on September 3, 1992. I t s quota i s SDR 1.372,OO million.
Since membership Ukraine had t w o Stand-by arrangements (1996-98) and the EFF
arrangement that expired on September 3, 2002. The final reviews o f the latter could not
be completed, due to the non-implementation o f a number o f prior actions, including
steps to reduce VAT refund arrears and eliminate tax exemptions.
2.
At end-March 2003, Ukraine’s total outstanding debt to the Fund was SDR 1,364
m i l l i o n (99.4 percent o f quota).
3.
Ukraine has accepted the obligations o f Article VIII, section 2, 3, and 4 o f the
Fund’s Articles o f Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that i s free o f
restrictions o n payments and transfers for current international transactions.
In the F a l l o f 2002 the Ukrainian authorities have requested a Stand-by
4.
arrangement, which they intend to treat as precautionary. Discussions on an economic
program that could be supported under such an arrangement are continuing.

On M a y 14,2003, the Executive Board o f the Intemational Monetary Fund (IMF)
5.
concluded the Article I V consultation with Ukraine. 1
Background

6.
Real GDP grew by over 4% percent in 2002, marking the third year o f Ukraine’s
economic expansion following the 1998/99 financial crisis. As in 2001, growth was
supported by robust consumer spending, reflecting large wage increases, but also by an
increase in net external demand. Consumer price inflation f e l l to near zero in 2002,
reflecting primarily the good harvests in 2001/02 and the resulting sharp drop in food
prices. L o w inflation was also supported by a tightening o f fiscal policy and delays in
increasing administered prices, as well as by continued exchange rate stability and rapid
remonetization. Inflation has, however, picked up in late 2002 and early 2003.
7.
The current account surplus increased significantly in 2002. The trade balance
was boosted by a sharp increase in export o f grain and o i l products. Recently imposed
anti-dumping measures by some trading partners led to a reorientation o f metals export to
markets in Asia. Current transfers were boosted by workers remittances and W o r l d War
I1 compensation payments, while private sector portfolio outflows increased. In late
2002, the government augmented i t s 2007 Eurobond series by about US$350 m i l l i o n o n a
net basis, but due to large amortization payments, public external debt continued to
decline. Gross international reserves increased to 2% months o f imports o f goods and
services by end-2002.

8.
National Bank o f Ukraine (NBU) interventions kept the hryvnia constant against
the U.S. dollar. Following the sharp exchange rate adjustment in the wake o f the 1998/99
financial crisis, the real effective exchange rate has remained broadly stable. The strong

Under Article I V o f the IMF’s Articles o f Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. At the request o f the Authorities a Public Information Notice (PIN) i s issued, following
the conclusion o f the Article I V consultation for countries seeking to make known the views o f the IMF to
the public. This annex i s based on the P I N issued after the M a y 14, 2003 Executive Board Meeting o f the
IMF.

Attachment 3

improvement in Ukraine’s trade and services balance suggests that competitiveness
remains adequate, as reflected in Ukraine’s comparatively l o w wage level.

9.
Monetary aggregates continued to grow rapidly in 2002, fuelled by large
unsterilized net foreign exchange purchases by the NBU. In response to falling inflation
in 2002, the NBU reduced the refinancing rate and lowered reserve requirements. Strong
growth in money demand, evidenced by the large balance o f payments surplus, reflected
growing public confidence and the continued remonetization o f the economy. The
monetary expansion contributed to the continuation o f very rapid loan growth in the
banking sector. Recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) missions found
that this has weakened banking sector capitalization and contributed to increased credit
risk. Interest rates decreased, but lending rates and spreads s t i l l remained high. The
share o f nonperforming loans remains also relatively high. There was no significant
change in dollarization in 2002.
The consolidated budget turned from a cash deficit o f 1% percent o f GDP in 2001
10.
to a surplus o f % percent o f GDP in 2002. Revenues increased sharply, partly due to high
wage growth and improvements in tax administration. However, the stock o f Value
Added Tax (VAT) refund arrears increased further, reaching 1% percent o f GDP at end2002. A significant shortfall in privatization receipts and large wage and pension
increases led to significant cuts in non-wage central government spending. Tax arrears
increased, mainly reflecting noncompliance in the energy sector and the inability to
collect installments for tax arrears restructured under the 2001 tax amnesty. The single
treasury account was fully implemented and some tax privileges were eliminated.
Unfunded social mandates were reinstated at the beginning o f 2002, although eligibility
criteria were recently tightened, targeting improved, and administration strengthened.
11.
Progress o n other structural reforms was mixed in 2002. Ongoing land reforms
continued to support growth in the agricultural sector.
However, the broader
privatization process slowed down, partly reflecting the lack o f any large sales to
strategic investors. The restructuring o f energy debts and the privatization o f the
remaining state-owned electricity distributors were delayed. Cash collections reportedly
increased to about 85-90 percent for gas and electricity, but the energy sector
accumulated significant tax arrears in 2002. The staff estimates that the quasi-fiscal
deficit in the energy sector was about 2% percent o f GDP, as reflected in the increase in
arrears to suppliers and the tax authorities. In addition, the coal sector receives budgetary
subsidies o f about 1 percent o f GDP annually. The stock o f debt and arrears o f stateowned energy companies amounted to an estimated 12 percent o f GDP.

Executive Board Assessment

12.
Executive Directors noted Ukraine’s strong macroeconomic performance in 2002,
marked by robust GDP growth, l o w inflation, improved external position, and a rapid
decline in public debt. Directors commended the authorities for their prudent demand
management policies, including tight fiscal policy, but regretted that the authorities did
not seize the opportunity to accelerate structural reforms. Going forward, they urged the
authorities to maintain sound macroeconomic policies and to revive and accelerate
structural reforms.

Attachment 3
Page 3 o f 4

13.
Directors considered that Ukraine’s near-term outlook remains favorable, with
economic growth in 2003 expected to remain solid and the balance o f payments position
strong. Nevertheless, the economy remains vulnerable to a number o f risks. Directors
noted the incipient inflationary risks, reflecting the recent high monetary growth, the
large increases in the minimum wage and the wage bill, and the likely reversal o f several
temporary factors that kept inflation l o w in 2002. In addition, a delayed global recovery
or macroeconomic policy slippages could undermine economic performance and weaken
the banking sector. Directors noted that the remonetization o f the economy has
contributed to recent performance, and prudent debt policies have strengthened Ukraine’s
financial position. However, domestic confidence must be sustained to support the
current stance o f monetary and exchange rate policy. Overall, Directors considered that
strong policies will therefore remain essential to protect the economy from any potential
shocks and guarantee medium-term sustainability.
14.
Directors stressed that an acceleration o f structural reform will be necessary to
improve the investment climate, create an enabling environment for the private sector,
and increase productivity to achieve sustained economic growth and reduce poverty over
the long term. They noted recent progress in land reform and small and medium-scale
enterprise development and privatization. Among the priority areas requiring clear
definition and further action are reforms o f the tax system and the social safety net, a
strengthening o f the financial sector, reform o f the energy sector, and improvements in
transparency and governance - not only in the public sector but also in the private sector
where there i s a particular need for sound corporate governance.
15.
Directors considered that the proposed fiscal stance for 2003 is appropriate. They
nevertheless expressed concern about several fiscal issues that should be resolved as soon
as possible. These include the continued accumulation o f VAT refund arrears, which i s
jeopardizing tax compliance, export, and the overall perception o f the rule o f law if it i s
not reversed. They were also concerned about the large increase in government
spending, which could r i s e further in 2004 on the basis o f the new minimum wage law.
They considered that tax reform remains a high priority, but were concerned by the
implication for the fiscal stance o f rate-reducing reforms, which could constrain the scope
for reforming the social sector. Directors suggested that further increases in public sector
wages should be limited as much as possible, carefully phased, and linked to employment
rationalization, with the aim o f maintaining a l o w fiscal deficit in 2004.

16.
Directors urged that, as part o f the planned tax reforms, rate reductions should be
linked with a broadening o f the tax base and elimination o f tax exemptions. They
welcomed recent changes to the profit tax as a step in the right direction. Directors urged
the authorities to w o r k with parliament o n further reforms, including the elimination o f
tax preferences under the VAT. In addition, they stressed the importance o f providing a
stable tax environment, which will need to involve greater accountability o f the tax
authorities and the rapid elimination o f the stock o f VAT refund arrears.
17.
Directors endorsed the primary focus o f monetary policy o n keeping inflation
low, and commended the authorities for reducing inflation in 2002. Going forward, they
urged the authorities to monitor price trends closely, and to be ready to tighten monetary
They supported greater central bank
policy if needed to keep inflation low.
independence. Directors agreed with the view that the hryvnia remains competitive.

Attachment 3
Page 4 o f 4

They urged the authorities to move towards greater exchange rate flexibility to absorb
shifts in either direction in money demand and the balance o f payments. They supported
the authorities’ intention to move toward a more explicit inflation targeting regime over
the longer term, with the further development o f financial markets and a more predictable
monetary transmission mechanism.

18.
Directors urged the authorities to implement the main recommendations o f the
recent FSAP missions to strengthen the banking system. High real interest rates and the
s t i l l large share o f nonperforming loans are indications that credit risk remains pervasive
and calls into question the sustainability o f the recent rapid growth in bank credit.
Directors endorsed the importance o f proceeding with the strengthening o f the financial
position o f a major bank without further delay. Directors expressed concem about the
NBU’s new long-term lending facility, which may distort the credit market, limit the
flexibility o f monetary policy, and raise govemance issues. They urged the NBU to focus
i t s efforts o n more fundamental banking issues, including improving banking supervision,
raising capital ratios, and moving to close banks that do not meet prudential
requirements. Directors welcomed recent steps to bring Ukraine’s anti-money laundering
legislation in line with Financial Action Task Force recommendations, and urged the
authorities to move swiftly to i t s full implementation.
19.
Directors stressed the importance o f enhancing transparency, strengthening
governance, and creating a level playing field for all economic agents. They welcomed
the authorities’ intention to accelerate the privatization process and urged that it be
transparent and competitive.
20.
Directors cautioned that large quasi-fiscal deficit and debts in the energy sector,
manifested in the continued accumulation o f tax and supplier arrears, constitute
significant risks to fiscal policy and call for ensuring hard budget constraints. Addressing
these problems will require greater transparency and accountability, especially with
respect to the state-owned gas monopoly, Naftagaz.
2 1.
Directors supported the authorities’ goal o f joining the W o r l d Trade Organization
next year. They considered that the resulting progressive trade liberalization should help
to strengthen Ukraine’s economy and underpin i t s further integration into the world
economy.
22.
Directors welcomed the recent improvements in economic statistics, and
Ukraine’s subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard - the first among the
countries o f the Commonwealth o f Independent States.
23.
Directors commended the constructive dialogue between the Fund and the
authorities aimed at reaching agreement in the near future on a program under a
precautionary arrangement with the Fund. A strengthening o f structural reforms, with
broad ownership, and policies to preserve macroeconomic stability will be an essential
part o f such a program.
24.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to include collective action
clauses in their future sovereign debt issuances.
