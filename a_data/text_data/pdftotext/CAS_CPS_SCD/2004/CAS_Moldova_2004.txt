EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.
Moldova’s last full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY99-01 was presented to the
Board o f Directors in M a y 1999. IDA had initially planned to prepare a full CAS for Board
discussion in FY02, but decided to wait until Moldova’s full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) was ready. Instead, an interim Progress Report, discussed by the Board in M a y 2002, was
prepared to provide the basis for continued lending and analytical work during FY02-03. The
Government completed and approved i t s Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(EGPRSP - Moldova’s version o f the PRSP) in June 2004. The EGPRSP and JSAN were discussed
at the Board on November 11, 2004. This C A S sets out the lending and non-lending support to
Moldova for the period FY05-FY08. It has been prepared in consultation with the Government o f
Moldova, representatives o f c i v i l society, the private sector, and development partners active in
Moldova.
2.
Moldova’s transition to a market economy has been difficult, with high vulnerability to
external shocks, a volatile internal political environment, and mixed reform implementation. After
declining by more than 60 percent since independence, the Moldovan economy has finally rebounded,
with growth averaging 6.7 percent over the last three years. While impressive, Moldova’s growth
performance remains largely consumption-led, driven mainly by remittances from abroad. With a per
capita GDP o f only US$542 and a poverty headcount o f 48 percent, Moldova i s the poorest country in
Europe. The Government considers poverty reduction, and in particular achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), i t s major challenge and has undertaken extensive consultations in
developing i t s poverty reduction strategy, the EGPRSP. The EGPRSP aims to achieve over the
medium-term (2004-06): (a) sustainable and inclusive economic growth; (b) reduction o f poverty and
inequality and increased participation by the poor in economic development; and (c) human
development.
Meeting the MDGs will require sustained long-term economic growth that
disproportionately favors the poor. This calls for policies to maintain macroeconomic stability and
improve the rural economy.

3.
This C A S i s set against the backdrop o f a difficult policy environment. The policies and
actions proposed in the EGPRSP reflect a significant departure from past unfulfilled policy
commitments and policy reversals. I t will take some time, however, to ascertain the level o f the
Government’s commitment to the reforms articulated in the EGPRSP. As a result, the C A S takes a
cautious approach. It will mainly support interventions at the local/community levels in rural areas
and small cities-the two areas with the highest concentration o f poverty-employing a Community
Driven Development (CDD) approach. These interventions will focus directly o n helping Moldova
achieve i t s MDGs, and will consist o f selected interventions to improve the quality o f and access to
social services-ducation,
health, social protection, and community infrastructure. I t will also
support the Government’s effort to implement reforms to eliminate the bottlenecks to growth
identified in the EGPRSP-improvements in the business environment and public sector governance.
The CAS recognizes that these are areas where the perception gap has been the widest and past efforts
at reforms have been less successful. Active dialogue with the Bank and development partners in
these areas i s ongoing and successful policy actions will allow the Government to demonstrate i t s
sincere commitment to reform. Success also would lead to greater donor support.

4.

Over the period FY05-08, planned new lending under the base case will total US$90 million.
Progress in implementing the benchmarks outlined in the EGPRSP, including a solid track record in
achieving improvements in the business environment and public sector governance, sustained over a
period o f 12 to 18 months, would trigger a high-case lending scenario. Under the High Case, IDA
will be in a position to resume support o f structural reforms, possibly through development policy
lending and complementary investment credits, with an additional US$47 m i l l i o n in lending. The

- 11 ..

Bank’s non-lending program i s tailored t o provide the analytical underpinnings for lending, and
would include studies to improve pro-poor targeting o f IDA resources.

A number o f measurable improvements are expected by the end o f the CAS period, including:
An increase in social assistance targeted at the poor from 60 percent to 85 percent;
Improvements in the quality o f basic (primary and lower secondary) education, and an
increase in primary school net enrollment in rural areas from 96 percent to 98 percent and
upper secondary from 28 percent t o 35 percent;
Greater involvement o f c i v i l society in public policy, increase in civil society participation in
delivery o f social services, and monitoring o f government programs;
Lowering o f the cost o f doing business to South Eastern Europe standards in the area o f
customs clearance, time and cost o f registering a new business, and obtaining licenses and
permits; and
Lowering o f perception o f corruption in government, by a reduction in single source
procurement from 45 percent to 20 percent o f the total number o f contracts, and from 51
percent to 15 percent o f the total value o f contracts.

6.
The current portfolio will contribute t o attaining the CAS outcomes. N e w IDA lending i s
designed to complement ongoing operations in achieving these results, with an emphasis o n providing
assistance t o the poorest segments o f the population, and on supporting greater transparency in the
handling o f public funds and a better business environment. In addition, a number o f new GEF
operations will support the Government’s actions to address environmental MDGs.

7.

IDA’Snon-lending program, which aims at providing the analytical underpinnings for the
investment operations, will focus on: (a) an in-depth assessment o f the economy, through a Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM), and updates on a number o f fiduciary assessments - FSAP
(Financial Sector Assessment Program), ROSC (Reports on the Observation o f Standards and Codes:
Accounting and Auditing), CPAR (Country Procurement Assessment Review), C F A A (Country
Financial Accountability Assessment); (b) sectoral policy notes to inform and guide lending in
agriculture, social assistance, health, education, disaster management, private sector development,
local government and community development, and legal empowerment as well as a People’s Voice
initiative to enhance civic engagement; and (c) PRSP and poverty assessment updates.
8.
The implementation of this C A S faces a wide range o f uncertainties, derived from the
Government’s capacity and commitment t o implement the EGPRSP, fiscal pressures, a volatile
situation in Transnistria, the forthcoming elections, and changes in the external economic and
political environment. Thus, it i s possible that the country might not be able to achieve the reform
track record necessary to advance to the High Case scenario. The design o f the C A S deals with these
eventualities insofar as direct budget support from IDA only would be considered if the country meets
the high-case triggers, including satisfactory implementation o f the EGPRSP. In addition, a C A S
Progress Report (mid-term review) would be undertaken after 24 months o f implementation t o
evaluate progress, to assess the continuing relevance o f the strategic thrust o f the program, and, if
necessary, to adjust the program to new and emerging realities in the country. The indicative lending
and AAA programs will be subject to periodic reviews with the authorities t o ensure continued
relevance and alignment with the EGPRSP.
Proposed Agenda f o r Discussion by the Executive Directors
The Executive Directors may wish to discuss whether the base case provides adequate
support for the EGPRSP and the MDGs.
The Executive Directors also may wish to discuss whether the focus on governance and
improving the business environment as the triggers for the High Case i s appropriate.

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) sets out the W o r l d Bank Group’s planned
lending and non-lending support to the Republic o f Moldova over the period FY05-FY08. It i s
aligned with the priorities detailed in the country’s Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (EGPRSP - Moldova’s version o f the PRSP). The CAS has been prepared in
consultation with the Government o f Moldova, representatives o f c i v i l society, the private sector,
and development partners active in Moldova.
2.
The key challenge for Moldova i s to sustain and improve upon the recent gains in
economic growth and poverty reduction by committing to and sustaining a consistent policy
reform and governance improvement agenda. The overall objective o f this CAS, therefore, i s to
assist Moldova in reducing i t s high level o f poverty, the highest in Europe, by: (a) promoting
conditions for sustaining growth and employment creation; (b) improving access to social
capital and services, and community infrastructure; and (c) improving public sector governance
and combating corruption.
3.
Planned new lending over the period FY05-08 will total US$90 m i l l i o n for the base case,
and will consist o f selected interventions to improve the quality o f and access to social services
and community infrastructure, foster a good investment climate, and address public sector
governance issues. Progress in implementing the benchmarks outlined in the EGPRSP, including
a solid track record o n improvements in the business environment and public sector governance,
would trigger a high-case lending scenario. Under the High Case, IDA would be in a position to
resume support o f structural reforms, possibly through development policy lending and
complementary investment credits, with an additional US$47 m i l l i o n in lending. The Bank’s
non-lending program i s tailored to provide the analytical underpinnings for lending, and would
include studies to improve pro-poor targeting o f IDA resources.

4.
A CAS Progress Report (mid-term review) will be undertaken after around 24 months o f
implementation to evaluate the continuing relevance o f the strategic thrust o f the program and, if
necessary, to adjust the program to new and emerging realities. In addition, the indicative lending
and analytic programs will be subject to periodic reviews with the authorities to ensure continued
relevance and alignment with the EGPRSP.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

PoliticalEconomy and Social Context

5.
Background. The Republic o f Moldova, geographically situated between Ukraine and
Romania, has a population o f about 4.2 million (of which 601,700 reside in Transnistria) and a
territory o f 33,800 km2. Moldova has few natural resources and i t i s almost entirely dependent
upon imports for i t s primary energy requirements. Given i t s endowment in r i c h agricultural land
and a temperate climate, the country has relied heavily on agriculture throughout i t s history.
Currently, agriculture and ago-processing activities account for roughly 30 percent o f Moldova’s
GDP and a significant part o f the population i s s t i l l directly engaged in the sector. Ethnic
Romanians account for approximately 64 percent o f the population, the rest being o f Ukrainian,
Russian, Gagauzian (Turkish), Bulgarian, and other origins.

-2B.

Moldova’s Transition Experience

6.

Difficult Initial Conditions. Moldova’s transition to a market economy has been
difficult. Following the collapse o f the Soviet Union, Moldova faced one o f the deepest and most
prolonged recessions among the transition economies. As with many o f these economies,
independence brought an end to the system o f subsidies and transfers from which Moldova
benefited. This large systemic terms o f trade shock was exacerbated by the effects o f a number o f
other initial conditions. Among these were an obsolete industrial sector integrated into the Soviet
economy, inadequate institutional development and capacity, and a dependence o n agriculture
that, with the demise o f i t s energy intensive irrigation system, left the economy exposed to
adverse weather-related conditions. These conditions were compounded by a mixed record o f
structural reform implementation and exposure t o a number o f external shocks. As a
consequence, in the 13 years since independence, per capita GDP has dropped by more than 55
percent and poverty has grown significantly, accompanied by an increase in inequality. Indeed,
the incidence o f poverty in Moldova i s n o w the highest in Europe.

7.

Transnistria. Independence also generated internal political conflict. The c i v i l war that
erupted in 1992 l e f t a separatist government in control o f the eastern territory o f Moldova known
as Transnistria. Transnistria contained a significant part o f Moldova’s industrial base, making
Moldova even more dependent o n agricultural production and imported energy and creating a
fractured customs space with important implications for smuggling and tax revenue mobilization.
8.
Mixed Reform Implementation. Moldova was viewed as an early and successful
reformer. Macroeconomic stabilization was achieved relatively quickly and a number o f
important first generation reforms were undertaken, such as trade, price, and exchange rate
liberalization. The momentum behind these initial reform efforts, nevertheless, was n o t
maintained and Moldova’s reform experience has since followed a decidedly stop-and-go pattern.
For a brief period following the 1998 Russian financial crisis, a weak coalition o f pro-reform
parties succeeded in implementing a number o f important, reform measures, including
rationalization o f the energy sector, pension reform, land privatization, and WTO membership.
The political consensus backing the reformers, however, was fragile and the government failed t o
develop broad pro-reform constituencies. Political infighting among coalition partners, popular
discontent at falling living standards, and the slow and unsatisfactory outcomes o f the reforms,
combined with the growing and pervasive level o f poverty, l e d t o the decisive victory by the
Communist Party o f Moldova (CPM) in the 200 1 elections.
9.
The current CPM Government blames the sharp rise in poverty o n the structural reforms
undertaken by previous governments and accuses these administrations o f being highly corrupt.
The electoral p l a t f o m o f the current government promised, among other things, t o increase
salaries and pensions, halt corruption associated with the privatization o f state-owned enterprises,
and control the price o f basic commodities and utilities. The economic recovery that began in
2000 has allowed the govemment t o partly deliver o n many o f i t s election promises, thereby
bolstering the support o f i t s base constituencies. The Government has followed a more dirigiste
approach, creating barriers for business and rent-seeking opportunities that have exacerbated
corruption. I t also has reversed some earlier-completed privatization deals, as w e l l as some
accomplishments o f past programs o f reform. These actions have created a difficult environment
for policy dialogue, b o t h internally and with the IFIs.
10.
Several additional factors have contributed t o this difficult policy environment. M o s t
important, the resumption o f growth has convinced the Government o f the effectiveness o f i t s
interventionist policies. However, the suspension o f both the IMF program and IDA’Sadjustment

-3credit (SAC3) point to a significant perception gap. The collapse o f these programs has also had
an effect o n the attitude o f other donors and there i s a significant risk that Moldova, with i t s
hesitant efforts at reform, will end up isolated from the international community. The
forthcoming elections in early 2005 are likely to inhibit any immediate progress o n the reform
agenda. However, the actions proposed in the EGPRSP and the announced interest in a closer
relationship with the EU, represent a change in policy direction and open a window o f
opportunity for productive dialogue, possibly closing the perception gap. T h i s window o f
opportunity may widen following the 2005 elections.

C.

Poverty in Moldova

11.
Moldova i s the poorest country in Europe. Per capita GDP (2003) was US$542, and
US$2,428 in purchasing power party (PPP) terms (2002). Depending o n the measure o f absolute
poverty used, between 40 and 50 percent o f Moldovans are poor and the majority can b e
considered extremely poor (see Table 1). Furthermore the depth o f poverty remains quite
substantial. The poverty gap, reflecting the total resources needed t o eliminate poverty by
bringing the consumption o f the poor up to the poverty line, amounted to about 7 percent o f GDP
in 2002, or o n average about 16.5 percent o f the poverty line for each poor person.

Who Are the Poor? There are sharp divergences in poverty by location and
demographic characteristics. As elsewhere in the CIS, poverty rates in large cities have been
lower than rates in small towns and among the rural population. Unique t o Moldova, however, i s
the fact that even in large cities, over one-quarter o f the population i s poor and one-fifth i s living
in extreme poverty. As in many other transition economies, large households are more likely t o
be in poverty than small households. Similarly, households with many children and elderly
persons are more likely to be poor. Households headed by people over 50 years o f age are less
l i k e l y to be poor than those headed by people o f 30-49 years o f age, a reflection o f several cofactors, such as returns t o experience in employment and pension income as w e l l as household
size. Poverty rates are lowest for people in households in which the head has some higher
education, but one-quarter o f these households are poor. Consistent with patterns for households
with more children, poverty rates are higher among children than among adults. Across
economic activities, households in which the head i s engaged in agricultural activities (mainly
hired agricultural workers) are at higher risk o f poverty. In fact, two-thirds o f households headed
by hired agricultural workers are poor. Where household heads are self-employed, household
poverty i s less likely. This latter category, however, i s relatively scarce throughout Moldova.

-4-

13.
Poverty I s Strongly Linked to Economic Growth. One o f the key features o f poverty
in Moldova i s i t s strong link t o economic growth (see Figure 1). Following the regional financial
crisis in 1998 and the severe
contraction in the Moldovan

economy, poverty rates increased

dramatically, reaching 7 1 percent

Conversely, between 2000 and
2002, with the turnaround in
economic growth, poverty f e l l

percent o f the population. The

highlights the vulnerability o f the
population t o poverty. Inthe event
o f another sharp economic downturn, a substantial fraction o f the population i s vulnerable and
will likely fall into poverty. Sustaining economic growth, therefore, will b e k e y t o reducing
poverty over time.
1

14.
Coping with Poverty. W h i l e growth has been the driving factor in reducing poverty,
social insurance programs also have contributed t o poverty reduction. Social insurance programs
reduced poverty by between 5 and 11 percentage points, owing t o their high coverage. In
contrast, social assistance programs, which are meant to be direct instruments o f poverty
alleviation, failed t o make significant gains because o f lower coverage, poor targeting, and a
mismatch o f benefit levels with needs. Besides government assistance, international migration
has been a central coping strategy, even though it has high social costs and poses significant
personal risks for many. With more than a quarter o f the Moldova’s working age population
abroad, there has been considerable disruption in personal lives and family relationships, as more
and more Moldovan children, especially in rural areas and small towns, l i v e without their parents.
Inequalities in Access to Social Services Are Acute. While economic growth in
15.
Moldova has been pro-poor, reducing poverty rates across a l l locations and demographic
characteristics, the emerging inequalities in access t o health care and education are changing the
distribution o f economic opportunities and will lead to increased future welfare differences
between the r i c h and the poor. While the utilization o f health care services by the r i c h has
increased, the poor simply forego health care unless i t i s absolutely critical. The continued bias
o f public spending in favor o f hospital care results in regressive public expenditures o n health
care. These changing utilization rates across income categories also reflect the increasing
importance o f informal payments needed t o obtain health care services, payments that the poor
cannot afford. The l o w utilization rates by the poor are likely t o lead t o poorer health outcomes,
affecting productivity and placing future welfare at risk.

16.
In education, participation in the compulsory level o f schooling has been remarkably
resilient, the main exception being pre-school enrollment. However, the poor are less likely to
seek post-compulsory education. The persistent disparities in enrollments starting from the final
years o f compulsory schooling and continuing into university education mean that attainment
gaps - between r i c h and poor, and rural and urban populations - are n o t closing. Given that
households with higher education are increasingly more likely t o b e better off, and since they are
better able to invest in the education o f their children, the persistent disparities at higher levels
reinforce a process which transmits poverty from one generation t o the next.

-5Pathway out of Poverty. Well-paid employment i s a strong pathway out o f poverty in
17.
Moldova, but j o b creation has been much lower than j o b destruction. High rates o f j o b
destruction are typical in transition countries; but new jobs need to be created at a faster rate. The
services sector in Moldova has yet to emerge as a significant provider o f formal sector jobs, and
i t s share in employment has fallen steadily - a sharp contrast with other transition countries.
Those who fail t o avail themselves o f the opportunities typically turn back to subsistence farming
for their livelihoods, or migrate to other countries in search o f employment. The new private
sector i s the only source o f employment growth in Moldova, increasing i t s employment by 4
percent per year. These firms account for only a small share o f non-agricultural employment.
The primary factor behind the l o w j o b creation i s the high cost o f doing business.

Recent Economic Performance

18.
Turnaround in Growth. Moldova was the last country in the CIS to see a return t o
positive growth. After falling by more than 60 percent between independence and 1999,
cumulative growth o f more than 20 percent has been recorded since 2000. Inthe last three years,
growth has averaged more than 6.7 percent. A number o f factors have contributed t o Moldova’s
improved economic fortunes: (a) as a result o f the prolonged economic recession, capacity
utilization in f i r m s that continued to operate was very l o w thus allowing production to expand
with little additional investment; (b) important structural reforms, including pension reform and

Fiscal and Monetary Policy. The recovery in growth has also benefited the fiscal
accounts. A robust increase in value added tax (VAT) collections and lower interest expenditures
(reflecting both lower interest rates and the accumulation o f interest payment arrears o n external
debt) resulted in a fiscal policy that has remained relatively tight over the last three years, with a
primary surplus (cash) averaging 2.6 percent o f GDP since 2000. The key fiscal challenge
continues to be external debt service. In 2003, scheduled public debt service amounted t o
US$136 million - about 45 percent o f central government revenues. With external budgetary
financing scarce following the expiration o f Structural Adjustment Credit 3 (SAC3) and with the
suspension o f the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF ), debt service payments
to bilateral and commercial creditors (with the exception o f the Eurobond) were halted in August

-62003.’ After declining to single digit levels in 2001-2002, inflation increased noticeably in 2003,
reaching 15.7 percent by year-end, partly as a result o f unusually large increases in food prices
(related to the poor harvest) and a sharp increase in public utility prices.
20.
Remittances and the Balance o f Payments. While exports have grown rapidly, the
growth in imports has been faster and has accelerated rapidly in recent years. As a result, already
massive trade deficits have deteriorated further, exceeding 30 percent o f GDP in 2003. These
large trade deficits have been only partially offset by growing inflows o f workers’ remittances,
leading to a widening current account deficit.2 Remittances have thus become a major source o f
domestic financing, contributing about 25-30 percent o f GDP and fueling the domestic demand
and the rapid growth in imports. Despite central bank intervention, the l e i appreciated by 5
percent against the U S dollar in nominal terms, and by considerably more in real terms, over the
course o f 2003 and 2004.

ii.

ExternalEnvironment

2 1.
The disintegration o f the Soviet Union had a profound impact o n the Moldovan economy
and i t s external trade relations. Yet, unlike many o f the other transition economies, Moldova has
not significantly diversified i t s trade patterns. Exports are s t i l l concentrated in a few commodities
and are s t i l l predominantly destined for the CIS market. The high dependence o n the Russian
market exposed Moldova’s vulnerability to regional trade shocks. When the regional financial
crisis hit in 1998, Moldova’s exports fell by half. With the strong regional recovery, particularly
in the Russian market, Moldova’s export performance rebounded. While EU import restrictions
on key Moldovan exports (i.e., wine) hinder market access, a number o f domestic policies
negatively influence the ability o f exports to penetrate overseas markets. Removal o f these
barriers will be a prerequisite for the successful expansion o f exports to the EU.
22.
Moldova’s economic vulnerability to the external environment also extends to the fiscal
sphere where it has become increasingly dependent on the taxation o f imports for fiscal revenue.
The taxation o f imports provides almost half o f total tax revenues, primarily via the VAT and the
excise tax on imports. Since the massive growth in imports has been driven largely by
consumption, any slowdown in consumption that also curbs imports will have significant fiscal
implications.
23.
The EGPRSP highlights European integration as a fundamental focus o f Moldova’s longterm development objectives. The EU has also stepped up i t s interest in Moldova - with the
concept o f the “new neighborhood” policy Eramework - as Moldova will constitute the EU’s n e w
border with the accession o f Romania in 2007. Deeper integration into Europe, however, has a
number o f important policy implications, such as the harmonization o f legislation on standards,
customs, and banking, as w e l l as the willingness to accept political reforms demanded by the EU.

’

With Moldova’s suspension o f debt service payments to Gazprom at the end-2001, and to bilateral creditors in August 2003,
external payments arrears reached US$69.9 million at end-2003. During 2004 arrears were reduced to USs25.2 million as a result o f
the Gazprom and Hewlett Packard debt buy-back.

The large unrecorded inflow o f workers’ remittances creates uncertainties regarding the actual size o f the current account deficit.
Recent data revisions have resulted in an improvement in the 2003 current account deficit from 11.2 to 7.3 percent o f GDP. This
correction, however, still leaves some US$] 30 million in net errors and omissions, most likely reflecting further unrecorded inflows o f
remittances.

-7-

iii.

Medium-TermProspects and R i s k s

24.
Medium-Term Growth Prospects. A number o f the factors that have contributed t o
economic growth in Moldova are likely to persist over the C A S period but are unlikely to sustain
the current growth momentum over the medium term. Indeed, the EGPRSP i s quick to recognize
that Moldova’s consumption-led growth experience does not provide the basis for the sustainable
growth needed to rapidly reduce poverty. While large inflows o f workers’ remittances can be
expected to continue, i t i s unlikely that the past rate o f growth o f these inflows will be sustained.
The growth impetus from past structural reform efforts has not been reinforced by new structural
reform efforts and the business and investment environment has remained poor and unstable.
Foreign investment in Moldova has declined from over 10 percent o f GDP in 2000 to around 3
percent o f GDP in 2003. At less than 16 percent o f GDP, gross investment remains l o w even by
regional standards. The limited extent o f domestic savings implies that Moldova will continue to
depend on external financial resources. Under the assumption that efforts to implement the
economic development program articulated in the EGPRSP fall short in the near term, that n o
new external budgetary financing from the development partners i s forthcoming, but there i s n o
further deterioration in the policy environment, GDP growth in the base case i s expected to fall t o
6 percent in 2004 and then average 3 percent over the medium term. In the event, however, that
the policy or business environment further deteriorates or that Moldova i s confronted by a
contraction in remittances or export demand, then a further decline in economic growth can be
expected.
25.
Debt Sustainability. Moldova’s external debt has grown from almost zero in the early
1990s to an estimated US$1.7 billion (89 percent o f GDP) at the end o f 2003. T h i s indebtedness
was driven by large and growing external current account deficits in the second h a l f o f the 1990s
(which averaged 9.7 percent o f GDP) and the sharp nominal depreciation o f the l e i in the
aftermath o f the Russian crisis. Public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt at the end o f 2003
was about 52 percent o f GDP. Domestic public debt (all short-term) was about 15 percent o f
GDP. The net present value (NPV) o f PPG debt i s composed mostly o f claims by multilateral
institutions (56 percent) - including the World Bank (30 percent), the IMF (15 percent) and the
EBRD (8 percent) - and by Paris Club creditors (24 percent), other official bilateral creditors (2.4
percent) and commercial creditors (18.7 percent). According to the indicative policy-dependent
debt and debt-service thresholds, Moldova’s NPV o f debt and debt service could be considered as
sustainable in a range o f 200-250 percent and 25-35 percent o f revenues, respectively. As shown
in Attachment 1, the NPV o f debt to revenues, however, i s projected to fall below the indicative
range only in 2007 while the debt service-to-revenue ratio i s projected to remain below the
threshold only from 201 1. I t i s estimated, however, that with the application o f traditional debt
relief mechanisms, such as a stock o f debt operation on Naples terms from Paris Club creditors
and comparable action by other official and commercial creditors, Moldova’s NPV debt ratios
will fall below the required cutoff thresholds for consideration in global debt relief initiatives,
such as HIPC.3
26.
With i t s large public debt service burden and the absence o f external budgetary support,
Moldova has not remained current on i t s external debt service obligations. In 2003, Moldova
closed i t s fiscal financing gap by accumulating additional interest and principal arrears (US$3 8.9
million or 2.0 percent o f 2003 GDP) on i t s extemal debt t o Gazprom and bilateral and
commercial creditors. These arrears constituted nearly one-third o f the total interest and principal
due (US$136 million) in 2003. In June 2004, Moldova bought back the US$115 m i l l i o n

National B a n k o f Moldova. A number o f other debt buy-backs and restructuring have also taken
place. These operations significantly reduce the debt servicing profile, o n a commitment basis,
over the next three years.

base case scenario the NPV o f PPG external
debt i s expected t o fall below the
sustainability threshold (200-250 percent o f
Government revenues) in 2007 while debt
servicing will remain above this threshold
(25-35 percent o f Government revenues)
until 201 1. The analysis points t o problems
with liquidity and not solvency. As shown
in Figure 2, over the CAS period scheduled
debt service for the public sector remains
heavy (between US$lOO m i l l i o n and

US$120 m i l l i o n until 2007). Given this debt
servicing profile and the expected absence o f significant donor financing, the Government will
need t o r e l y o n sizable primary fiscal surpluses and domestic sources o f financing t o cover i t s
external debt obligations. Given the expected slowdown in the economy, as w e l l as planned
reductions in personal and corporate income tax rates over the 2005-2007 period, the Government
risks not meeting i t s ambitious revenue targets. With elections scheduled f o r early 2005, i t also
will be difficult for the Government t o satisfy both i t s domestic expenditure commitments,
including those needed t o meet the MDG targets, and i t s external debt-service obligations.
Without significant external debt restructuring, it i s likely that the government will be required to
issue more state securities, obtain inflationary financing f r o m the National Bank, and accumulate
additional external payment arrears to bilateral and commercial creditors. A credible strategy t o
address the debt problem, however, would involve securing traditional debt relief f r o m the Paris
Club (which would require an IMF program), sustainable growth and prudent fiscal management,
and demonstrated track record o f reform as a basis t o seek additional donor resources, including
budget support.

28.
The EGPRSP and Improved Growth Prospects. Implementation o f the EGPRSP,
including policies to improve the business and investment climate, reduce corruption and further
structural reforms, could improve Moldova’s medium-term economic prospects. An improved
business environment should encourage an increase in foreign and domestic investment and a
channeling o f workers’ remittances away f r o m consumption towards productive investment. The
established reform track record would also unleash financial support from the donor community.
The financing needed to implement the EGPRSP could be met by a combination o f Paris Club
rescheduling and external budgetary support from donors, including IDA development policy
lending. As indicated in the EGPRSP, under this High Case scenario, growth will b e higher, in
the order o f 5 percent per annum over the C A S period.
29.
Economic Vulnerabilities. The Moldovan economy remains vulnerable t o external
shocks. The main driver o f the economy will continue t o be consumptiodworker remittances.
However, the large trade and current account deficits that accompany such a growth strategy will
not b e sustainable unless economic policies trigger a larger domestic supply response. In
addition, the dependence o f the economy o n the agricultural sector leaves i t exposed t o a number
o f weather-related shocks. Moldova also suffers from excessive dependence o n a limited number

-9o f trading partners and commodities. This leaves Moldova vulnerable t o adverse economic
developments in its main trading partners, particularly Russia.

E.

Structural and Sectoral Developments

i.

Private Sector Development

30.
Weak Business Environment. The poor business and investment climate in Moldova
constrains private sector development and i s a major impediment t o sustainable growth and
poverty reduction. The Moldova Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) confirms that although
in recent years some positive changes were observed, particularly in the areas o f business
registration and licensing where substantial legislative and administrative changes were
introduced, the existing regulatory environment and i t s implementation remain inadequate and are
at the core o f the poor investment climate and limited foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows!
Firms consider themselves t o be constrained by the heavy and costly regulatory burden, such as
business licensing, permits, registration, inspection, certification, and standardization. Moreover,
the regulatory burden in Moldova tends t o b e comparably greater than in other CIS countries o f
similar income levels.

3 1.
Limited Trade and Transport Facilitation. The total logistics costs in Moldova,
estimated at 22 percent o f GDP, are the highest in Europe and significantly impede the country’s
participation in international trade.’ The main issues related to the high logistics costs are the
poor shape o f the transportation infrastructure, corruption at the border, l a c k o f transparency o f
custom procedures, and overly complicated and numerous documentary requirements - a l l o f
which reduce the competitiveness o f export and make the country less attractive t o foreign
investment.
32.
Constrained Agricultural Sector. In addition t o the poor business climate and limited
access t o finance, the agricultural sector i s confronted by a number o f other k e y constraints. The
slow restructuring o f the ago-processing sector, continued state control o f key agri-business
industries and ad hoc government interventions in domestic and export markets perpetuate
marketing inefficiencies and limit competition that depresses farmgate prices. Without further
reforms in agro-processing, returns t o investments at the farm level will remain weak, farm
productivity and agricultural wages will remain low, and farmers will continue to pursue a
subsistence-oriented coping strategy. At the farm level, despite substantial progress in land
reform and despite legal and institutional impediments to the development o f the land market, the
continued threat o f reversals in land privatization prevent the emergence o f genuinely restructured
and consolidated farms, which would f o r m the basis for recovery and growth. The combination
o f l o w returns and weak growth performance in agnculture hampers the development o f the nonfarm economy and the creation o f viable off-farm employment opportunities that could pull rural
dwellers out o f poverty. The vulnerability o f the agncultural sector t o natural disasters, including
floods, droughts, ice storms and landslides, further complicates the agncultural recovery process.
33.
Degrading Environment. Inappropriate agricultural practices, unsustainable logging for
fuel wood and building timber, and unsustainable hunting and harvesting, contribute t o the

against expropriation.

-10degradation o f soil and biodiversity resources and increases the vulnerability o f the poor to these
natural disasters. The l o w level o f forest cover (10.3 percent o f the land area) i s recognized as a
contributor t o erosion, floods and landslides. Limited access t o insurance mechanisms, savings
and credit services, or drought-proofing agricultural technologies inhibits the ability o f the rural
population t o manage and mitigate the respective risks. Agricultural pollution and Persistent
Organic Pollutants (POP) stockpiles, in particular obsolete pesticides and Polychlorinated
Biphenyls (PCBs) in the energy sector contribute to significant pollution o f land and water
resources, including ground waters. Lack o f access t o clean, affordable heating services o n the
part o f most rural households contributes t o indoor pollution, while a dilapidated energy
infrastructure produces outdoor pollution through excess carbon emissions.
34.
A Healthy Financial Sector with Emerging Risks. The banking sector i s comprised o f
16 banks and represents the overwhelming portion o f the financial sector. Non-bank financial
institutions, capital markets and the insurance sector remain largely underdeveloped, if n o t
embryonic. Overall, the banking sector i s reasonably w e l l regulated by the National B a n k o f
Moldova, w h i c h has a comprehensive prudential framework in place. Competition among banks
for loans and deposits has intensified considerably in the past five years, pushing down interest
spreads as banks have increased their total assets threefold t o nearly 40 percent o f GDP in 2003.
Dollarization o f the banking system remains high, with nearly h a l f o f total assets and liabilities in
foreign exchange. The banking system i s concentrated in the largest 6 banks. K e y vulnerabilities
include the growing role o f the Government in the banking system and the relatively large
number o f banks with controlling ownership stakes offshore. The private sector remains
confronted by high borrowing and transaction costs with bank lending based o n collateral rather
than the cash generation capacity o f businesses.
35.
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT).
Although Moldova enacted i t s first anti-money laundering l a w in 2001, it i s s t i l l struggling to
effectively operationalize i t s Financial Intelligence Unit. In many respects, Moldova s t i l l lacks
appropriate legal tools that would enable officials to identify, investigate, prosecute, and prevent
money laundering or terrorist financing, while sufficient capacity does not yet exist in the court
systems, prosecutors office, among l a w enforcement/police officials, or financial sector
supervisors t o implement a coordinated and effective AML/CFT regime. The recent FSAP
indicates there i s s t i l l a significant need for implementation o f fundamental legal tools t o address
ML/FT as w e l l as training and capacity building.

ii.

Infrastructure

36.
One o f the main risks for sustainable economic growth and reduction o f poverty stems
from the continued deterioration o f the basic infrastructure (roads, water, sewerage, and the
housing stock) and the poor financial situation o f the energy sector. The lack o f investment in
and deferred maintenance to an agmg infrastructure will continue t o limit access t o safe water and
sanitation, contribute t o unhealthy living conditions, degrade the environment, and reduce
Moldova’s competitiveness. Attracting quality foreign investments, creating jobs and increasing
productivity will be more difficult without improvements t o the basic infrastructure and the
reliability o f the energy supply. The main issues in infrastructure are the following:

Energy-need for consolidation of reforms. A slow adjustment t o the post-independence
realities left the energy sector with large accumulated debts and deteriorating infrastructure
due t o a lack o f maintenance and investment. W h i l e significant reforms were undertaken
under previous governments, including the establishment o f an independent energy regulatory

- 11 agency (ANRE), the unbundling o f the vertically integrated power utility and the
privatization o f three out o f five electricity distribution companies, under the current
government reform efforts have stalled. The m a i n risks include the institutional weakness o f
ANRE, the incomplete regulatory framework (particularly related t o the cross-border
electricity trade) and the unfinished privatization agenda. Access t o an affordable energy
supply i s increasingly difficult in many rural and small urban communities where district
heating either does not exist or where the centralized heating systems collapsed when i t
became clear that they were not economically viable.

Water and Sanitation-in perpetual financial crisis. The infrastructure o f the A p a Canal
(the water and sanitation utilities) has deteriorated and the majority o f these utilities are in
perpetual financial crisis due t o l o w collections, l o w tariffs, and high water losses. Moreover,
about 40 percent o f the water in these systems fails t o meet sanitary, chemical, or biological
criteria. Purchase o f safe water represents a disproportionate level o f household expenditure,
which increases the burden o n the poor.
Transport-extensive but deteriorating. The existing road network, albeit extensive, has
been poorly maintained and n o concerted effort has been made t o address the needs in line
with the changing trade patterns. Moreover, reform o f the management and financing o f the
sector has been slow. The state road administration s t i l l operates o n the o l d model, with n o
segregation o f the planning, contract awards and supervision functions f r o m the
implementation o f c i v i l works, thus impeding the development o f a strong private road
construction industry and the efficient use o f the scarce state resources for road maintenance
and rehabilitation.
Degrading Housing and Communal Services. The housing stock was privatized after
independence; today i t i s deteriorating rapidly owing t o lack o f maintenance. The inexistence
o f organizational capacities for homeowners to undertake collective action, combined with
lack o f funding and an unclear legal framework, constrains the abilities o f households t o take
action t o improve their immediate living conditions.
Telecommunications-emerging
but weak institutional framework.
W h i l e certain
progress has been made in developing the information and communications network
infrastructure and services, their reliability, security, and sustainability remain weak o w i n g t o
a lack o f competitive safeguards and limited private sector investment. Service bottlenecks
created by the s t i l l state-owned MoldTelecom, and weak institutional capacity are responsible
for the continued l o w levels o f access and connectivity.

iii.

Human Development and Social Protection

37.
The health, education, and social protection systems in Moldova have suffered f r o m the
economic decline and stalled policy reforms. In general, the quality o f services has declined and
the system has been unable t o address emerging needs. Despite some reforms undertaken before
2000, the provision o f health care, education, and social protection continues t o face daunting
challenges.

Education-emerging inequalities. Although access t o compulsory schooling (grades 1-9) i s
high across income groups, disparities begin to emerge towards the end o f compulsory
schooling as poor and rural children are more likely t o drop out before completing the cycle,
and thus less l i k e l y t o continue to upper secondary and university. Although Moldova
compares favorably with other CIS countries in basic education enrollments, upper secondary
enrollments are substantially lower and reflect to a large extent the much lower continuation
rate onto this level by rural and poor children. The fiscal adjustment in the aftermath o f the
Russian crisis was accompanied by increased out-of-pocket financing including through
informal private contributions. L o w perceived benefits relative t o the costs (including the
opportunity costs) o f continuing with education appears to b e the primary reason why poor
and rural families do not continue with schooling. Secondary education i s expensive for poor
households, and even at the compulsory level out-of-pocket costs are n o t negligible, yet
public expenditures o n education do not especially favor the poor. There i s some evidence o f
improvements in the quality o f education (as measured by student performance), but
challenges remain and inequities persist: many children s t i l l do not perform w e l l o n tests o f
basic literacy and numeracy slulls; resources in schools are s t i l l lacking, and the gaps in
performance between urban and rural students are widening.
Social Protection-need for better targeting. Pensions. The 1999 reform o f the pay-asyou-go pension system has met some o f i t s short-term objectives, such as making pension
payments on time, in-cash (as opposed to in-kind), and without the need for budget transfers.
Pension reform, however, remains incomplete and the general pension l a w i s n o t being fully
implemented. There are a number o f outstanding policy issues t o be addressed, including
inter alia: (i)
the pensions o f farmers and the self-employed; (ii)
the reform o f disability and
pension privileges for certain categories o f the population and
survivors insurance; and (iii)
certain sectors. Although the administration o f the social insurance system has improved in

- 13 the last three years, outstanding issues s t i l l need t o be addressed. These include: (i)
moving
fkom a system o f awarding pension benefits based o n stated wages t o one based o n
contributions actually paid; (ii)significant delays in the introduction o f the individual
development o f financial management and the IT system.
accounts system; and (iii)
Social Assistance. Some success in improving the targeting o f nominal compensations for
the increased energy costs was achieved in 2000 during the energy reform, but existing
programs s t i l l rely heavily o n categorical and discretionary targeting approaches, and as a
result 43.6 percent o f benefits go t o the non-poor. The targeting o f social assistance benefits
needs significant improvement to effectively target the poor population.
Social Care Services. The quality o f the social care services has deteriorated, owing t o lack
o f resources and poor management practices. The system in Moldova i s s t i l l dominated by
expensive institutionalhesidential care, concentrating o n providing living conditions and
medical care, rather than social integration and social care. I t i s not flexible enough t o
quickly adapt to newly emerging and changing needs (street children, drug users, trafficked
women, etc.) nor does i t allow disadvantaged groups t o receive services within their families
and community.

F.

Governance and Corruption

38.
Moldova inherited weak institutions and has not yet succeeded in building a modem state.
As a consequence, ample opportunities for corruption abound. The c i v i l service i s politicized, the
management o f public funds has improved but s t i l l lacks transparency and efficiency, local
governments have limited capacity t o carry out their extensive mandates, the judicial system i s
not trusted, and c i v i l society has yet to emerge as a significant voice in the country. Not
surprisingly, corruption in Moldova i s perceived as being very high. The Business Environment
and Enterprise Performance Survey I1 (BEEPS) reports that nearly 60 percent o f respondents
consider corruption t o be a “moderate” or “major” constraint t o business, the highest in the
region. Excessive regulations, bureaucratic discretion, and associated corruption affect the
competitiveness o f the economy, put downward pressure o n wage rates, and drive people either t o
emigrate or to j o i n the shadow economy, unofficially estimated at between 30 and 50 percent o f
GDP.

39.

Weak Civil Service. Although new c i v i l service r u l e s were introduced officially in
1995, Moldova has yet t o internalize the notion o f a politically independent, merit-based c i v i l
service. Instead, the current public administration represents a mixture o f o l d bureaucratic
structures, rules and procedures with some new institutions developed under earlier but currently
stalled reforms. Chronic political instability and volatility have worsened the initial lack o f
institutional capital, while the politicization o f the c i v i l service has l e d to a high turnover o f staff,
chronic policy discontinuity, a deterioration in operational efficiency, the erosion o f institutional
memory, and very l o w staff morale.
40.
Improving Public Finance Management. In the last few years, the basis for improved
public expenditure management has begun to emerge. The EGPRSP process and efforts at
developing a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) have brought attention t o policy
prioritization, strategic planning, and the allocative efficiency o f public resource management.
Also, public finance management has been strengthened, with real progress achieved in
developing the treasury system and improving debt management. This progress serves as a good
basis upon which to continue improving the financial accountability fkamework in Moldova. The
budget formulation process needs t o be consolidated t o provide a comprehensive view o f public

-14revenues and expenditures, and greater coordination i s needed within the Ministry o f Finance, the
revenue authorities, and the spending agencies t o improve cash management. The internal and
external control frameworks are weak and the existing internal audit organizations need t o move
f r o m ex-post control and inspection activities t o an audit model that i s supportive o f improving
the overall control environment.

41.

Wavering Local Government Reform. Moldova’s local governments share many o f
the same financial management capacity constraints as the central government. T w o attempts t o
reform local governments have n o t produced significant success. In 1998 a n e w territorial
administrative system aligned Moldova with the European Charter o f Local Self-Government,
creating 11 judets, plus the city o f Chisinau. The current government reinstated the previous
system o f 36 rayons. Central t o both designs i s the preponderant problem o f the imbalance
between the responsibilities and resources assigned t o local governments. This, plus weak local
administrations and negligible c i v i l society involvement, further reduces the ability o f local
governments t o effectively deliver o n existing mandates. As a first step at redressing this flaw, a
fiscal cadastre has been introduced that allows local governments to increase revenues and reduce
dependence o n the central government.

42.

Judicial Reform-Restarting Stalled Reforms. An effective judiciary can play an
important role in reducing corruption, improving the business environment, and contributing to
growth. The Government has introduced several reforms in the legal and judicial sector; the tiers
o f the court system were reduced f r o m four to three and new C i v i l and Civil Procedural Codes
were introduced. The continuing agenda includes: improvement in the legislative drafting o f
economic matters; development o f the legal education system; restarting o f the reform o f the
court system; promoting o f the development o f the market for legal services, including access t o
justice through pro bono services; and strengthening o f the enforcement o f court rulings. Given
the dispersed understanding o f justice (Ministry o f Justice, judges, prosecutors, attorneys-at-law,
notaries, bailiffs, the legal academic community, NGOs), there i s a need t o engage stakeholder
participation to reach common understandings. In addition, for any real positive improvements,
the independence o f judges and entire judicial system from the undue influence o f political,
business, and corporate interests should be at the core o f the reform agenda.

43.
Emerging but Weak Civil Society. The last two years have witnessed a major surge in
c i v i l society activity, and today close t o 3,000 c i v i l society groups/ NGOs exist in the country,
many o f them established with the support o f external assistance. The relationship between the
c i v i l society/NGOs and the Government has been guarded in the recent past, o w i n g in part t o
mutual suspicion. Recently, however, under the aegis o f the EGPRSP process, there has been a
rapprochement, engendered first by the creation o f Participation Council6 and second, by the
extensive consultations with the stakeholders. In addition, the monitoring and evaluation
arrangements being proposed under the EGPRSP include c i v i l society groups. Thus, the
leadership i s beginning to involve c i v i l society groups in the local, regional, and national
discourse.

The Participation Council was created in October 2001 with the aim o f ensuring the inclusive participation o f all stakeholders in the
process o f EGPRSP development and implementation. It includes representatives o f the civil society, academia, and the private
sector, as well as representatives o f central and local public administration.

Cross-Cutting Issues

44.
Key Gender Issues. Economic hardships accentuated gender bias in health, education,
and employment. Deterioration in health conditions and increasing mortality among men,
attributed to suicide, alcoholism, drug use, cardiovascular disease, and other stress-related
illnesses, led to a widening o f the gap in l i f e expectancy to 8 years between men and women.
Between 1990 and 2000, primary school enrollment rates for both sexes rose at all levels. At the
higher education level, however, female enrollment significantly outpaced male enrollment,
increasing fkom a female to male ratio o f 0.92 in 1990 to 1.29 in 2000. However, during the same
period female employment took a down turn. While currently high at 50 percent o f total
employment, i t dropped from 60 percent at the beginning o f the 1990s. Moreover, transition has
deepened gender-based j o b segregation, with women heavily concentrated in lower-pay and
lower-skilled sectors o f the economy.’ Also, regardless o f education, women are found in lower
level jobs andor lower paying jobs.*
45.
The erosion o f state subsidized services, such as childcare, left women with the double
burden o f both professional work and increasing household responsibilities, leaving them with
less time for training, andor work, and thus leading to lower paying jobs.’
Women’s
reproductive health has also deteriorated. The proportion o f pregnant women with anemia i s at an
all time high o f 45 percent since the beginning o f the transition, and it i s the highest in the region.
Inadequate nutrition, along with poor living conditions and lack o f financial resources for
personal hygiene, has contributed to a high maternal mortality ratio o f 28 per 100,000 live births.
46.
Moldova i s a major country o f origin and transit for the trafficking o f women and girls to
the Middle East, the Balkans, and other European countries. The International Organization for
Migration (IOM) estimates that at least 10,000 women a year go abroad with hopes o f finding
employment and the local Moldovan news media estimate at least 100,000 young women are held
as sex slaves abroad. Moldova i s also a leading supplier o f underage girls to Russia for sexual
exploitation: the Government estimates that 5,000 girls are trafficked to Russia annually.”
47.
Youth Issues. Youth (16-30 years o f age) make up about one-fourth o f the population,
and are leaving Moldova in massive numbers, due to poverty and exclusion. The youth in
Moldova lack assets in three interrelated dimensions: (i)economic-assets leading to income
generation; (ii)
social-access to information; associative l i f e activities, social capital activities,
and free-time activities; care and guidance; and (iii)
participation in decision-making. Youth
poverty also covers other dimensions related to the transition age o f youthhood: isolation,
vulnerability, powerlessness, and idleness-due to lack o f free-time activities and safe spaces - all
o f which encourages r i s k y behaviors such as drug addiction or engagement in illegal activities.
These phenomena tend to be particularly acute in rural areas and small towns, where spaces for
youth activities and services disappeared during transition.

COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND ISSUES

A.

Country Priorities and Agenda

48.
Key Characteristics of the EGPRSP. The Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN)" identifies
four characteristics o f the EGPRSP, namely: an inclusive participatory process, an adequate
poverty diagnostic, a three-pillar strategy, and an alignment with the MTEF. The EGPRSP
process, endorsed by the government, was inclusive as it involved stakeholders and c i v i l society
at the national, regional, and local levels. It provided for a wider participation within the
government and contributed to better coordination among donors. The poverty diagnostic, based
o n the recent household budget survey, provided an adequate basis for formulating an antipoverty strategy. The three-pillar strategy o f the EGPRSP called for sustainable and inclusive
economic growth, reduction o f poverty and inequality and increased participation in the economic
development o f the poor, especially the most vulnerable groups, and improved human resource
development. Finally, the MTEF sector strategies in education, health, and social protection
reflect the priorities identified in the EGPRSP.
49.
Three-Pillar Strategy. The f i r s t pillar underscores the importance o f maintaining
macroeconomic stability, improving the business environment, and accelerating privatization and
structural reforms. A high priority i s attached t o improving the business environment and
investment climate t o reverse a decline in investment while continuing reforms in agriculture and
infrastructure and improving governance. The second pillar seeks to strengthen human resource
development through improving the quality o f and access o f the poor to education and health.
The third pillar underlines the need t o strengthen social protection and inclusion through
continuation o f pension reform, improving targeting o f social assistance, and improving labor
market flexibility. The links o f the EGPRSP t o the MDGs and Moldova's status v i s - h i s the
MDGs are presented in Attachment 3.
50.
Board Recommendations for Strengthening the EGPRSP and Addressing the
Implementation Risks. The EGPRSP and the J S A N were discussed at the Board o n November
11, 2004. The Board noted that the EGPRSP i s comprehensive and contains critical actions that
over time could help foster sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. They noted a
number o f priority areas for strengthening the EGPRSP during implementation. These areas
include: (a) improving the macroeconomic and fiscal framework by aligning spending plans more
closely with realistic projections o f fiscal revenues and i d e n t i f j m g a l l sources o f financing
necessary for their implementation; (b) improving prioritization through strengthening the
poverty impact analysis o f proposed EGPRSP measures; (c) improving monitoring and evaluation
by strengthening domestic capacity, and focusing o n outcome indicators in priority areas; and (d)
addressing external vulnerabilities through effective implementation o f structural reforms and
broadening o f the economic base.

51.
The Board noted with concern several critical areas where current policies do not match
those articulated in the EGPRSP. These include slow progress in implementing structural
reforms, increased government interventions in economic activity, and the unsustainable mediumterm fiscal framework. The Executive Directors noted that these actions m a y limit the scope for
IDA concessional assistance, and urged the authorities to rectify these policy actions, especially
" Republic o f Moldova: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and Joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note, October 18, 2004 (Report No.
29648).

-17in the areas o f state monopolies, licensing and regulation, land consolidation and agriculture
subsidies, targeting o f social assistance and privatization. They underscored the need for the
authorities to demonstrate a good track record o f implementation. They look forward to clearer
signs o f govemment ownership o f proposed reforms, and encourage the authorities to engage
stakeholders and citizens in monitoring and providing feedback and evaluation o f the EGPRSP
implementation.

B.

Feasibility of EGPRSP Implementation

52.
The EGPRSP presented by the Government provides a basis for IDA assistance. The
extensive consultation process followed during preparation and the readiness o f the Govemment
to accept comments and suggestions signals a significant improvement in the capacity and
willingness o f the Government to engage a broad range o f stakeholders in frank and open
dialogue. The results also show that a significant constituency supports the EGPRSP.
53.
Despite these important developments, however, it i s necessary to stress that
implementation o f the EGPRSP could prove difficult. The EGPRSP implies a significant
departure from the policy actions undertaken during the last three years, with a continuing wide
gap between declared intentions as set out in the EGPRSP and actions o n the ground. The
political environment i s fragmented, with strong special interests that resist moves to reform and
greater transparency. I t i s therefore possible that some o f the actual policies adopted and
implemented by the Government and Parliament may deviate from the intent and content o f the
EGPRSP.
54.
The international community has an important role to play in supporting Moldova's
advance towards an open market economy and alignment o f i t s institutions with European
practices. Since sustaining such support would be difficult in an environment o f mixed policy
implementation, IDA will work with other donors to monitor progress in implementing the
EGPRSP. The planned CAS Progress Report would provide an opportunity to review
implementation performance and to consider possible changes to enhance the program.

BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

Implementationof the Last CAS

Lessons from OED Evaluations and Other Reports

55.
The Bank's program in Moldova has benefited from several evaluations and analyses
over the last two years. The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) undertook a Country
Assistance Evaluation (CAE) in mid-2003, reviewing the outcome o f 1993-2002 programs.'2 The
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) reviewed the Analytical and Advisory Services (AAA)
program. In addition, an analysis o f the political economy and i t s implications for IDA lending,
including a series o f private sector and business environment studies, has been undertaken.
Reviews o f the business environment include the Cost o f Doing Business (2001 and 2003), an
Investment Climate Assessment (2003), and ECA-wide Business Environment and Enterprise
Performance studies (200 1 and 2003).

Committee on Development Effectiveness: Moldova Country Assistance Evaluation, May 14, 2004 (Report No. CODE 20040036).

-1856.
The CAE report identified a gap between, on the one hand, the goals o f the various
programs, which were considered relatively consistent and appropriate, and, on the other, the
unsatisfactory development outcome. It noted that past strategies underestimated the difficulty o f
the transition and made less than candid assessments o f the emerging political and social risks.
B o t h OED and QAG pointed out the importance o f internalizing evolving political realities in the
Bank’s work. This suggests a need to test reform commitment and ownership before h r t h e r
development support lending can be considered.
57.
B o t h OED and Q A G noted that the AAA program would have benefited from a core
integrative macroeconomic piece-such as a Country Economic Memorandum or a Development
Policy Review-that included an analysis o f the implications o f the Government’s approach to
economic management and a presentation o f policy options. QAG rated individual pieces o f the
AAA work satisfactory, but found that the overall AAA program was implemented in an ad hoc
manner.

58.
In preparation for a new CAS, an internal Country Portfolio Review found that
investment operations have performed well, but have had limited impact in securing broader
sectoral improvements. The review recommended: (a) a more frank evaluation o f political risk,
and greater flexibility in project design to adapt to these risks; (b) to focus the CAS o n k e y
thematic bottlenecks (e.g., poor business environment and governance issues) that inhibit project
performance, with benchmarks to determine government commitment; (c) n o further adjustment
lending in the absence o f proven reform track record; and (d) better integration o f analytic w o r k
with the lending program, and fuller participation by affected communities.

ii.

IDA Portfolio Management and Performance

59.
As o f mid-October 2004, the Moldova portfolio comprised 11 ongoing investment
operations with net commitments totaling US$146.2 million (including one GEF-funded grant o f
US$5 million), of which US$106.2 million i s undisbursed. The average age o f the portfolio i s 2.9
ye&, with 2 projects more than 6 years old. Infrastructure accounts for about half o f the
portfolio, with operations in human development, private sector development, and rural and
agricultural development constituting the other half. The portfolio generally i s performing w e l l
with only one problem project (Social Protection Management). A summary o f the status o f the
portfolio can be found in Attachment 2.

60.
Annual Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPR), chaired jointly by the Bank and
the Government, have been held regularly over the last 3 years. The last CPPR in January 2004
broadened participation to include NGOs and development partners and most o f the agreed
actions have been implemented. Highlights include the establishment o f an inter-ministerial
Technical Committee to monitor project execution; workshops o n disbursements and
procurement; and plans for monitoring and evaluation training for project and government staff.
iii.

IFC and MIGA Portfolio Management and Performance

61.
Since Moldova became a member in 1995, IFC has committed US$72 m i l l i o n o f i t s o w n
funds and arranged US$25 million in syndications in the power, telecommunications,
agribusiness, SME, and financial sectors. In addition, IFC also has supported technical assistance
projects in banking, tourism, wineries, food processing, and leather industries. I t continued to
provide additional long-term financial resources to commercial banks for on-lending to local
corporations, SMEs, and individuals. The country’s difficult business climate has had a

-19dampening effect o n foreign and domestic investment, making it difficult for IFC t o develop and
support n e w projects. Going forward, I F C will maintain i t s support in helping develop private
enterprises, for example by providing long-term funding through local banks, and through
assistance with attracting foreign strategic investors. I t will also pursue opportunities to support
infrastructure development.
Recognizing that investment projects in Moldova require
comprehensive technical assistance, IFC will continue to combine investment operations in
strategically targeted areas with various non-investment and technical assistance operations.
62.
Moldova has been a member o f MIGA since 1993. MIGA guarantees have facilitated
approximately US$63.7 m i l l i o n o f FDI, in the power, financial and real estate sectors. It has also
been involved in mediating disputes (in the power sector) and provided technical assistance t o
formulate and implement strategies for attracting FDI, with advice and tailored assistance t o
public and private organizations in image-building, sector-targeting, outreach and information
dissemination. MIGA’s online information service has 153 documents for Moldova pertaining t o
investment opportunities and other related legal and regulatory issues.

iv.

CAS Preparation: Participatory Process Followed

63.
Stakeholder consultations were undertaken during the preparation o f this CAS. Those
consulted include the Presidency, the Govemment (central and local levels), the Parliament, the
business and financial community, c i v i l society/NGOs, the media, think-tanks, academia, trade
unions, opposition parties not represented in Parliament, and donors (bilateral and multilateral).
The consultation process helped t o create stakeholder contact groups t o enlarge the sphere o f
Bank cooperation and civic engagement, which should help facilitate C A S implementation.
Three different large stakeholder groups were engaged in a series o f 8 roundtables and meetings:
(a) the Govemment; (b) the business community; and (c) selected c i v i l society groups and
organizations from various parts o f the country (NGOs, academia, think tanks and research
institutes). A CAS website, with an electronic discussion forum, was launched t o provide added
scope for dialogue with stakeholders, and most consultation events were taped and transcribed.
Summaries o f the events were posted o n the CAS website in two languages, English and
Romanian. The electronic discussion forum i s ongoing, with suggestions and questions posted o n
the site. Attachment 4 summarizes the feedback obtained during the consultations.
64.
Suggestions from stakeholders complemented feedback f r o m the EGPRSP process and
shaped this CAS. Stakeholders welcomed the consultation process initiated by the Bank,
commenting that this was long overdue. They expressed concerns about the limited involvement
o f c i v i l society groups/NGOs in development discourse, repeatedly mentioning the important role
they can play. Other issues raised were: (a) the need for a better business environment; (b)
corruption; (c) direct financing o f beneficiaries to circumvent state bureaucracy; (d) infrastructure
development, education, health, and a legal framework; and ( f ) the need for greater transparency
in Govemment/IFI relations. A follow-up phase o f CAS consultation will involve validation and
continuing dialogue o n the development challenges facing Moldova. This will be initiated
following Board discussion o f the CAS.

Proposed Assistance Strategy

The overall objective of this CAS is to assist Moldova in promoting sustainable
growth and reducing its high level ofpoverty by:

..
.

Promoting conditions for sustaining growth and employment creation
Improving access to social capital and services, and community
infrastructure, and
Improving public sector governance and combating corruption.

i.

Strategic Context

65.
This C A S reflects the current country context, the EGPRSP framework, and the country’s
EU aspirations. I t also draws heavily o n the 2002 CAS Progress Report, the lessons learned f r o m
the OED Country Assistance Evaluation, the Country Portfolio Performance Review, the Poverty
Assessment, and a recent analysis o f the political economy and i t s implications for IDA lending.
It takes a long-term view o f the Bank’s assistance to Moldova. Meeting the MDGs, as stated in
the EGPRSP, will require sustained long-term economic growth that disproportionately favors the
poor. This calls for policies to maintain macroeconomic stability, improve the rural economy and
better target social assistance. Under the current constraining financial and institutional
environment, the challenges facing Moldova are daunting and will require long-term commitment
f r o m IDA and other development partners.
66.
This strategy i s set against the backdrop o f a difficult policy environment. The policies
and actions proposed in the EGPRSP reflect a significant departure from past unfulfilled policy
commitments. It will take some time t o ascertain the level o f the Government’s commitment t o
the reforms needed t o support the EGPRSP. Against this background, the C A S mainly will
support interventions at the local and community levels, employing a CDD approach that relies
o n the strong involvement o f communities and local government authorities. In addition, i t will
support the Government’s efforts t o eliminate the key bottlenecks t o growth that were identified
in the EGPRSP - improvements in the business environment and public sector governance. The
strategy recognizes, however, that these are areas where the perception gap has been the widest
and past efforts at reforms have been less successful.
67.
Each operation supported under this C A S will be based o n sound stakeholder analysis,
and in collaboration with the authorities and local institutions. The Bank will also involve, as
appropriate, c i v i l society in the design and implementation o f lending and non-lending services.
I t i s hoped that this approach will help broaden the constituency for reform and help monitor
implementation o f both the EGPRSP and the CAS. Lastly, the CAS moves away fkom the
input/output based program o f the past t o a more results-based strategy, designed o n the
principles o f effective Government ownership, anchored in the EGPRSP, and based o n true
partnership with the Bank and other development partners. The results-oriented framework for
this C A S and i t s linkage with the EGPRSP i s presented in Annex B9.

ii.

Scenarios and Triggers

68.
This CAS defines two scenarios: a Base Case and a High Case. The Base Case reflects
the current country context and Moldova’s Performance-Based IDA Allocation. Over the fouryear C A S period (FY05-08), the Base Case lending envelope will be SDR63 m i l l i o n (US$90
m i l l i o n equivalent). The High Case provides about 50% more resources, for a total envelope o f

-21 SDR96 m i l l i o n (US$137 m i l l i o n equivalent). The lending and analytic programs described
below represent current intentions. Within the overall Base and High Case parameters, and
consistent with the overall goals o f the strategy, both may be adapted t o take advantage o f
emerging opportunities or unforeseen constraints. A full review o f implementation progress will
be conducted after a period o f around 2 years.
69.
The Base Case focuses o n three pillars, which are aligned with the medium- t o long-term
poverty reduction priorities detailed in the EGPRSP. These are: (i)
promoting conditions for
improving access t o social services,
economic stability, growth and employment creation; (ii)
capital and community infrastructure, as w e l l as minimizing environmental risks; and (iii)
improving public sector governance and combating corruption.
70.
Added emphasis will be placed o n learning through j o i n t consultative processes
(involving the Government, the Bank, development partners, and stakeholders) t o improve policy
dialogue, build consensus, and give greater voice t o the citizenry t o foster heightened public
accountability. The indicative lending and AAA programs (Table 3) will be subject t o periodic
reviews with the authorities, t o ensure continued relevance and alignment with the EGPRSP.
Additionally, a mid-term review (CAS Progress Report) will take stock o f advances in the
implementation o f the EGPRSP and evaluate the track record in policy reforms, including
fulfillment o f triggers for the High Case. Based o n these assessments, the review could suggest
necessary modifications to the Base Case.

Pillar 1.

Promoting Conditions for
Employment Creation

Economic

Stability,

Growth,

and

71.
The CAS consultations with the business community, the Trade Diagnostic Study, and
the Investment Climate Assessment Study all point t o the high cost o f doing business as a binding
constraint to the development and expansion o f the private sector (in particular SMEs) and j o b
creation. T o this end, the CAS will target actions t o reduce the cost o f doing business by assisting
the Government in simplifying bureaucratic controls and time-consuming approval procedures,
and streamlining enforcement t o reduce business harassment. Complementary attention w o u l d be
given t o actions to improve corporate governance, broaden financial intermediation, and improve
the maintenance o f basic infrastructure t o facilitate investment and economic activity. In
addition, the C A S will support the development o f the rural economy, where most o f the poor
live, and will place emphasis o n removing internal barriers that limit the export capacity o f the
country.

72.
Lending and Non-Lending Support. The Bank will seek to improve the understanding
o f the sources o f and impediments t o growth in Moldova. A Country Economic Memorandum,
currently under preparation will build on previous and current analytical w o r k (Trade Diagnostic
Study, the Investment Climate Assessment, Poverty Assessment, and Sector Strategy Notes). I t
will explore policy options for sustainable growth, as w e l l as measures needed t o mitigate
underlying social and economic risks. In addition, the Bank will support dialogue o n financial
and private sector reforms, including the development o f measurement instruments (surveys,
focus groups) to gauge improvements in the business environment. In FY04, a Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), an Accounting and Auditing Assessment (ROSC), and a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) were completed. Follow-up technical assistance
will be provided to support improvement in the financial accountability framework in the country,
including the need t o refine the AMLEFT regime. If requested by the Government, the Bank
would provide technical assistance for restructuring and management o f public debt.

-2273.
IDA will support efforts to improve Moldova’s competitiveness and employment
creation. Assistance will be provided to establish an institutional framework that reduces the high
cost o f doing business, particularly deregulation, and limit arbitrary practices in the use o f state
power. It will build o n the successful efforts t o regenerate the rural economy through pro-poor
growth investment mechanisms, an agricultural advisory network and business development
(under the Rural Investment and Services Project (RISP I))
by supporting the next phase o f the
adaptable program lending o n rural investment-RISP 11. Support for the next phase will b e
contingent o n continuing the implementation of reforms in the agriculture sector.
Pillar 2.

Improving Access to Social Services, Capital and Community
Infrastructure, and Minimizing Environmental Risks

74.

Critical for sustainable growth and poverty reduction, the C A S supports actions t o
strengthen human, social, and physical capital. IDA assistance will focus o n the targeting o f
social assistance t o better reach the poor and to facilitate their access to quality health, education,
and social protection services. Similarly, IDA assistance will seek to address the deterioration in
critical infrastructure, such as housing, public utilities, and transportation. IDA also will assist
the government in mitigating significant health risks derived from ground water pollution.
Lastly, assistance will be provided to address the serious risks posed t o rural communities f r o m
weather-related events.

Lending Program and Non-Lending Support. Achieving the MDGs will require
75.
targeted attention t o selected population groups and t o specific factors that foster poverty.
Following up o n the recently completed Poverty Assessment, the Bank will continue i t s efforts t o
help the Government improve i t s knowledge o f the characteristics and causes o f poverty. In
addition t o improving existing household surveys and creating a poverty map for Moldova, this
effort will better enable IDA to support the implementation o f the EGPRSP and provide needed
inputs for other IDA-financed operations.

76.
While primary education coverage i s broad in Moldova, quality i s poor and resources are
particularly scarce in rural areas. Further analytical work and investment in rural education will
be undertaken. IDA i s already helping Moldova address its health MDGs through the ongoing
Health Investment Fund project. In collaboration with the Global Fund t o Fight Aids
Tuberculosis and Malaria, IDA i s providing funding for an HIV/AIDS project. Building upon
past reforms, IDA will support the Government t o improve access by the poor t o health services,
to better integrate support at the community level, and t o identify those areas where a greater
effort i s needed t o achieve the health MDGs. IDA will assist the Government in evaluating the
current social assistance system and developing a strategy to improve targeting, particularly cash
benefits and nominal targeted compensation. The development o f the institutional basis
necessary to target social assistance to the truly poor will be an important element o f IDA
assistance.

77.

One o f the greatest challenges Moldova faces in reaching the MDGs i s in the provision o f
adequate water and sanitation services to the population. IDA i s already supporting this effort
through a Water Supply and Sanitation Pilot Project, and a GEF Agricultural Pollution Control
Project, which pilots support to agricultural, livestock and land management techniques t o reduce
nitrate contamination o f groundwater. IDA will increase its support in this area by assisting the
Government with the implementation o f i t s National Water Plan. IDA assistance will focus o n
medium-size towns and villages where the problem with potable drinking water and inadequate
sanitation i s most acute.

- 23 78.
The CAS supports the EGPRSP effort to improve the environment. IDA will seek
support for additional GEF resources, focusing o n improved wetland and flood management,
ecological restoration and forestation activities, capacity building for management o f protected
areas, biodiversity monitoring and enforcement. Since the poor have increasingly turned t o the
use o f “dirty” fuels under the impact o f the energy adjustment, IDA will utilize GEF resources t o
help adapt technologies for energy conversion and conservation. IDA has taken a leading role in
the early implementation o f the K y o t o Protocol and can be an important partner in efforts t o
develop Moldova’s carbon trading market through new project development, capacity building
and the replication o f best practices. Among the environmental issues supported under this C A S
i s strengthening the capacity for Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPS) management, public
awareness, and improved pest management for crops.
79.
The C A S attaches particular importance to building a culture o f local community
involvement in public issues by strengthening community capacities t o make decisions, and
organize and manage funds t o improve the quality o f basic social and economic services in the
participating communities. IDA, through the two social investment funds (SIF Iand S I F II)
has
,
already had notable success in this area. T o build upon this success, IDA will seek t o develop
institutional mechanisms to enable c i v i l society t o interact with public officials t o improve the
delivery o f public services and enhance the overall quality o f governance. It will support the
strengthening o f local government capacity t o undertake the new responsibilities placed o n these
governments under the decentralization reform program and t o position them t o better involve
local communities.

Pillar 3.

Improving Public Sector Governance and Combating Corruption

80.
Improving public sector governance and combating corruption are o f paramount
importance for the implementation o f the EGPRSP. Within the broad agenda o f issues covered
under this topic, IDA will place emphasis o n improving transparency and accountability in the
management o f public funds, expenditure programming, and evaluation practices. I t will support
greater involvement o f c i v i l society in exercising accountability over public action and the
delivery o f public services, focusing attention in particular o n community-driven development
and stronger local government ownership and leadership.
81.
Lending and non-lending support. IDA’S assistance will focus o n strengthening the
programming and management o f public resources. This will include assistance t o the
Government to: (a) institutionalize the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) by
building the capacity t o develop sector programs based o n realistic and prioritized resource
allocation; (b) strengthen budget management through a modernized treasury system; (c)
strengthen the public finance control fkamework; and (d) introduce a system o f Continuous
training to assure sustainability. IDA will maintain analytical underpinnings in this area through
updates o f the C F A A and the CPAR. and will review advances in procurement reform.
82.
The recently completed Justice Sector Assessment will enable the Bank t o engage the
Government, as w e l l as other stakeholders, in a dialogue o n legal and judicial reforms in
Moldova. In a context where justice i s delayed and/or denied either by a lack o f political will or
by financial constraints, community-driven demand for greater access t o justice needs t o be
promoted and strengthened. The CAS will seek to help the poor advance their legal interests,
take actions to secure or enforce their rights, and improve their well-being. Ultimately, legal
empowerment o f the poor will increase consciousness o n legal and judicial reform issues in
Moldova, and increase the demand for the rule o f law, as w e l l as placing pressure o n formal
institutions to reform.

The High Case would be triggered by the benchmarks presented in Table 4, which have
been discussed and agreed with the Government. The intent o f these benchmarks i s t o provide a
basis for IDA t o evaluate the progress made in critical areas that w o u l d justify a High-Case
scenario. Progress o n these triggers would be reviewed regularly, and the C A S Progress Report
would evaluate readiness to move t o the High Case. Under the High Case, IDA will consider
development policy lending (DPL). A m o n g the areas o n which such an operation might focus are
the critical actions needed to create modern market institutions, with emphasis o n policy
measures to strengthen the business environment and corporate governance, foster the
development o f SMEs and the agricultural sector, increase exports, attract foreign investment,
and secure the adoption o f n e w technologies. Consistent with the EGPRSP, the DPL would
advance the anti-poverty program from a policy perspective and also through the budgetary
resources it would provide. The DPL might also focus o n public administration and c i v i l service
reform, particularly o n policy decisions that are needed to advance the modernization o f the
government apparatus. This might include policy development capacity, pay reforms, staffing
rules, code o f conduct behavior, assignment o f responsibility and accountability, anti-comption,
and the functional reorganization o f the Government, as well as the framework for dialogue
between the Government and c i v i l society, procurement practices, and access o f the poor to
judicial and legal services. Based o n the Progress Report conclusions and satisfactory attainment
o f the High Case triggers, IDA would consider funding additional investment operations
consistent with the priority actions under the EGPRSP.

Monitoring and Evaluation

84.
IDA’S proposed lending program includes continued support for improvements in
Moldova’s monitoring and evaluation capacity through the Public Financial Management project,
IDF grants, AAA and cross-cutting elements o f various investment elements.
85.
While not formally based o n a results framework, the C A S program matrix (Annex B9)
articulates a results chain for IDA’Sprogram and augments the traditional monitoring o f progress
o n inputs and deliveries with a focus o n outputs and outcomes that are linked t o longer-term
country outcomes. It identifies a set o f outcome and output indicators t o measure progress. An
attempt has been made t o quantify these indicators with expected target ranges. In some cases,
more qualitative information needs to be derived. Where there are gaps in information, IDA will
work with the Govemment during the first year o f implementation t o identify specific
measurements o f outcomes.
86.
While specific operations have been proposed that will address the higher order outcomes
defined in the matrix, the C A S will remain dynamic, responding to changes in the country and the
need to redirect resources, particularly if the country should succeed in moving to the High Case.
At mid-term, the C A S Progress Report will draw o n an in-depth examination o f the C A S

outcomes and assess whether they remain relevant to the longer-term objectives given changing
country conditions.
87.
Annex B9 shows the links between the main areas o f the PRSP and the C A S program
matrix. Where possible, IDA will use data collection mechanisms that will be used in monitoring
the PRSP, mainly the longer-term outcomes. For other indicators, the PRSP does n o t provide a l l
the necessary information. This information will be obtained either through line ministries or via
the execution of proposed or ongoing projects.

iv.

Partnership and Coordination

88.

Coordination among the k e y donors-IDA, IMF, EBRD, EU, UNDP, and USAID-has
been very close, with several joint/parallel operations. The EGPRSP sets the basis for enhanced
cooperation with many donors, including the EBRD, DFID, and EU, n o w planning their next
rounds o f support.
89.
The Bank and the IMF have operated under a clear delineation o f responsibilities. As the
IMF PRGF program expired in December 2003, discussion o f the program renewal i s likely to be
lengthy and difficult. This uncertainty will have direct implications for other donors’ assistance,
especially for the availability o f funds for budget.
90.
USAID has been one o f the main providers o f technical assistance, but the current
program i s set to expire in 2005. Current U S A I D activities that are likely to continue include
post-privatization support for the agricultural sector, strengthening o f local governments, and
support for the development o f c i v i l society organizations and NGOs. Prospects for
continuationhesumption o f activities in other areas are less certain. The EU Moldova program i s
framed in the context o f the new neighborhood policy, which envisages development o f a specific
Action Plan setting out overarching strategic policy targets and benchmarks. The Action Plan
covers economic integration, emigration, international crime, energy, transport, and
telecommunications and support for c i v i l society. The EU Food Security Program has emerged
as the main source o f targeted policy-based budget support. W o r k o n social protection,

’

- 28 agricultural policies, public financial management, and statistics will be areas o f cooperation with
the Bank. Grant-funded budget support has been put o n h o l d following the suspension o f the
IMF program. EBRD’s recently approved strategy for Moldova supports private sector
development in finance, infrastructure, and SMEs. Emphasis o n improving the investment
climate defines an area o f mutual cooperation with the Bank. The government of Japan has been
among the active donors in Moldova. Japan has provided support for promoting SMEs through i t s
capacity development program to the Agency for Restructuring and Enterprise Assistance
Competitiveness and Productivity Center, which served as the Project Implementation Unit for
the PSD-I and PSD-I1 projects. T h e Japanese P H R D Fund has provided a number o f grants t o
prepare projects in several areas, most recently in public finance management. DFID provided
support in the preparation o f the PRSP and will play an important role in monitoring
implementation. I t has also been providing technical assistance for building institutional capacity
in developing the MTEF. In addition, ongoing IDA-financed projects in agriculture (RISP) and
social protection (SIF and SPM) have benefited from DFID contributions. The new DFID
country assistance strategy (2004-2007) will focus o n improving governance and the institutional
environment for poverty reduction, promoting pro-poor sustainable growth, and strengthening
conflict resolution efforts.

91.
SIDA (Swedish International Development Agency) i s an active IDA partner in a number
o f ongoing projects in several sectors, including AIDS, Energy 11, HIF, RISP, and SIF. The m a i n
directions o f SIDA’s country assistance strategy, which currently i s under preparation, are l i k e l y
t o remain governance, social inclusion, and economic growth. Their small grant program for
NGOs i s also likely t o continue. The government o f the Netherlands has been a stable provider
o f budget support, co-financing US$20 m i l l i o n for the SAC (2001) and the Health Investment
Fund (USSlO million). There i s current interest for cooperation in supporting public financial
management reforms through technical assistance. UNDP has supported the preparation o f the
EGPRSP and i s playing an important role in i t s monitoring. I t also has taken the lead in helping
the government elaborate the MDGs and in placing them in the Moldovan context. In addition,
UNDP i s actively supporting interventions at the central and local levels in capacity building, as
w e l l as providing support for c i v i l society groups and NGOs. It will continue t o be a major IDA
partner in helping Moldova reach the country-specific MDGs. UNICEF’s agenda includes
support in addressing the health needs o f mothers and children and the expansion o f development
practices for early childcare. It i s also IDA’Smajor partner in a number o f projects in the social
sector areas, such as HIVIAIDS, health reform, youth inclusion, and child protection through the
SIF. The U N I C E F N B partnership in Moldova i s o f value, and in some cases collaboration i s
reflected formally in specific agreements. WHO i s partnering with IDA in supporting healthfinancing reforms, including the implementation o f the health insurance scheme and in supporting
immunization programs.
V.

Managing Risks

92.
C A S implementation faces a wide range o f uncertainties, deriving from the Government’s
capacity and commitment to implement the EGPRSP, increasing fiscal pressures, a volatile
situation in Transnistria, and changes in the external economic and political environment. I t i s
therefore possible that the program will not advance t o the High Case scenario. Critical risks
include:
0

Macroeconomic instability. Fiscal management will continue t o be a source o f considerable
uncertainty. The Government may not be able t o contain the fiscal pressures stemming from
i t s own promises, especially given the approaching 2005 elections, and additional fiscal

-29

-

pressures may arise from developments regarding Transnistria. A fall in remittances m a y
lead t o an economic slowdown and lower tax revenues (now heavily dependent o n imports),
provoking further fiscal difficulties.

Loss o f Budgetary Discipline and Further Accumulation of Arrears. The absence o f an
IMF program and IDA program support may preclude a Paris Club agreement o n bilateral
debt. Under these circumstances, and with lower levels o f support from other donors, the
Govemment will struggle to avoid further accumulation o f foreign and domestic arrears.

Reform Stagnation. The current policy environment i s difficult. The Govemment has
demonstrated uneven commitment to policy reform making i t uncertain that i t can implement
the EGPRSP. I t i s possible that this uncertainty will remain after the next election, as clear
national consensus for reform has yet to emerge. The most likely scenario appears t o be a
stop-and-go cycle o f reform.
External Environment. The transition experience to date has demonstrated the high
vulnerability o f Moldova’s economy t o extemal factors. The concentration o f exports in a
few commodities primarily destined for CIS markets, particularly i t s high dependence o n the
Russian market, increases significantly i t s exposure to regional trade shocks. Further,
Moldova’s increasing dependence o n the taxation o f imports for fiscal revenue presents a
fiscal risk, as any slowdown in consumption that also curbs imports will have significant
fiscal implications.
Transnistria. While the crisis with Transnistria can be described as l o w intensity strife,
occasional escalations, particularly during election years, have been destabilizing. Despite
ongoing efforts t o resolve the crisis, analysts believe that i t may continue at a l o w level o f
intensity over the CAS period, but with unpredictable occasional periods o f escalation.

93.
Mitigating Measures. The structure o f this CAS i s designed t o address these risks by
providing incentives to reform. Specifically, higher levels o f IDA and other donor support
(including development policy lending) only would be available if the High Case triggers,
including satisfactory implementation o f the EGPRSP, are met. The Progress Report review
around 24 months into implementation, will enable the Bank to re-evaluate the strategic thrust o f
the program and to determine an appropriate line o f action. Moreover, the Bank will continue t o
support broad-based dialogue with a l l stakeholders in the country and explore ways t o facilitate
the creation o f pro-reform constituencies. While these efforts may take time t o achieve results,
they are perhaps the only sure way t o help Moldova realign incentives toward achieving
sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.
V.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

94.
The next four years i s a critical period. Moldova has prepared a poverty reduction
strategy with laudable intentions, which n o w needs t o be implemented to promote pro-poor
growth and improve the quality o f l i f e o f i t s people. Under the current constraining financial and
institutional environment, the challenges are daunting, and require long-term commitment f r o m
the Bank and other development partners. This C A S sets out the support the B a n k plans t o
provide to Moldova over the next four years in i t s effort t o achieve this objective.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

1.
This attachment updates the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted at the time o f the C A S
Progress Report o f M a y 2002.' This D S A i s based o n a loan-by-loan database provided by the authorities
for Multilateral and Official bilateral creditors as well as a breakdown by main categories for commercial
creditors.
2.
As o f end-2003, the stock o f total external debt amounted to US$1.7 billion or 89 percent o f
GDP, with public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt at US$l.O billion or 52 percent o f GDP
(excluding energy arrears). The NPV o f PPG debt amounts to US$O.9 billion, equivalent to 47 percent o f
GDP at end-2003. As reported in the CAS Progress Report, at end-200 1 the ratio PPG external debt was
67 percent o f GDP, correspondent to 60 percent o f GDP NPV terms.
3.
Debt service due o n PPG external debt in 2002 and 2003 totalled 58 and 44 percent o f Central
government revenue, respectively. In 2004, debt service o n PPG external debt i s estimated to decrease at
38 percent o f central government revenue (Table 1). With i t s large public debt service burden and
absence o f external budgetary support, Moldova has not remained current on i t s external debt service
obligations. As o f the end o f 2003, external payment arrears, including energy arrears, amounted t o
US$437 million, o r over 22 percent o f 2003 GDP.

4.
T o be eligible for HIPC debt relief, the ratio o f the NPV o f public and publicly guaranteed debt to
exports o f goods and services must exceed 150 percent. In the case o f very open economies, such as
Moldova, the alternative criteria o f the NPV o f debt to government revenues must exceed 250 percent.
The NPV o f debt, in these cases, i s calculated after the application o f traditional debt relief mechanisms.
T o actually receive debt relief, assuming eligibility, a country must have a PRGF program with the IMF
that has been o n track for at least 6 months. In Moldova's case, however, application o f traditional debt
relief results in a NPV ratio below the relevant threshold and, hence, Moldova i s not eligible for HIPC
debt relief.
CAS Lending Scenarios
5.
Base Case: Under the Base Case scenario, IDA lending for FY 2005-08 i s projected to be US$90
million or approximately US$25-30 million per year. Additional external new borrowing o f the public
sector i s mainly at concessional terms. The availability o f external financing, however, heavily depends
upon the government performance in the next 12-18 month. Under the Base Case scenario, it i s assumed
that Moldova resumes interest payments on Paris Club debt in 2004, maintains full debt service o n
Multilateral debt and Eurobonds and reschedules accumulated interest and principal arrears in 2006.
Figure 1 shows that the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio will drop below 250 percent in 2005 as a
consequence o f the assumed clearance o f external arrears. The ratio o f debt service to revenue, however,
will only drop substantially below the 35 percent sustainability threshold in 201 1.
6.
High Case: A solid track record in achieving improvements in the business environment and
public sector governance would trigger a High Case lending scenario, with additional US$47 m i l l i o n in
adjustment and program lending in 2006-2008. In the High Case scenario, Moldova i s expected to benefit
from renewed donor support. Furthermore, Moldova i s expected to fully normalize relations with
creditors by the end o f 2005. Additional external n e w borrowing o f the public sector i s mainly at
concessional terms. In addition to the assumption made under the Base Case scenario, the High Case
assumes that debt rescheduling on partly concessional terms offered by the Paris Club and Russia o n

' Moldova CAS Progress Report No. 241 13-MD.

arrears as o f end-2005 and on maturities falling due in 2006-2008. Debt owned to Romania and Turkey
are assumed to be rescheduled o n concessional terms. Figure 1 shows that the NPV o f debt-to-revenue
ratio will drop below 250 percent in 2005 as a consequence o f the normalization o f relations with foreign
bilateral creditors. The ratio o f debt service to revenue will permanently drop below 35 percent in 2008.

Long-Term Debt Sustainability*

The Base Case scenario assumes that Moldova will reach an agreement o n the payment o f
7.
principal arrears t o bilateral and commercial creditors by end-2005. Under this scenario, Moldova’s
NPV o f PPG debt-to-GDP ratio i s estimated to be 63 percent at end-2003, falling to 30 percent at end2007. The NPV o f PPG debt-to-revenue ratio i s estimated to be 395 percent at end-2003, falling t o 189
percent at end-2007. The debt service-to-revenue projections indicate that the government faces debt
service burden higher than in 2003 in the near future. The debt service-to-revenue i s projected to be 37.8
percent in 20043 and peak at 5 1.8 percent in 2007 as a result o f the rescheduling o f arrears with other
bilateral and commercial creditors.
8.
In the High Case scenario, Moldova i s expected to reach an agreement with the Paris Club o n the
rescheduling o f debt at terms comparable with other CIS countries4 and to reschedule external debt owed
to Romania and Turkey at concessional terms. As a result o f the rescheduling, Moldova’s fiscal
sustainability will improve. The NPV o f PPG debt-to-GDP ratio i s similar with the Base Case scenario.
Debt service as a percent of revenue, however, i s projected to remain below 35 percent for most o f the
period, peaking at 36 percent in 2007, compared to 52 percent in the Base Case scenario.
9.
Determining ifthe above ratios signal problems with sustainability o f Moldova’s debt burden i s
extremely difficult. Each o f the indicators has i t s merits and limitations in signaling potential debt
servicing interruptions, suggesting that they should be used in ~ o m b i n a t i o n .A~ growing body o f
empirical literature provides some guidance to assess h o w these indicators compare to thresholds o f debt
and/or debt service that are associated with a high probability o f debt distress or adverse growth
implications in low-income countries.6 A key result o f this literature i s that debt thresholds should be
established in light of the quality o f a country’s policy’s and institutions, suggesting that countries with
stronger policies and institutions can sustain higher debt and debt service ratios. On this basis and given
Moldova’s fast accumulation o f arrears in the past, the difficulties in maintaining future primary budget
surpluses and the l o w tax base, the levels o f the debt and debt service-to-revenue ratios are cause for
concern in the short and medium term.
10.
According to the indicative policy-dependent debt and debt service thresholds’, Moldova’s NPV
o f debt and debt service could be considered as sustainable in a range o f 200-250 percent and 25-35
percent o f revenue, respectively. However, the NPV o f debt-to-revenue o f Moldova i s projected t o fall
below the indicative range only in 2007, while the debt service-to-revenue ratio i s projected to remain
steadily below the range only f i o m 201 1.

This section i s based on the joint IMFIIDA paper, “ Debt Sustainability in Low Income Countries - Proposal for an Operational Framework and
Policy Implications”, February 2004.

The government bought out promissory notes that were handed over to Gazprom within the framework of the restructuring o f Moldova’s debts
for natural gas in 1999. The total amount o f the securities that had been bought out reached U S $ l l 5 million. The par value o f the promissory
notes was US$90m, and the rest of the amount i s a debt for their servicing.
The terms applied are similar to Naples terms.
For a more extensive discussion o f the pros and cons o f individual indicators see, “Debt Sustainability in Low Income Countries- Towards a
Forward-Looking Strategy,” IMF 2003, SM/03/185.
See, for example, Kraay and Nehru (2004); Patillo et al. (2002); and Cohen (1 997).

’ The thresholds depend on the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Index (CPIA) and indicate approximately a 25 percent probability o f
debt distress at that level (see the joint IMFIIDA paper, “ Debt Sustainability in Low Income Countries - Proposal for an Operational Framework
and Policy Implications,” February 2004).

Conclusion

11.
Moldova’s NPV o f debt-to-revenue ratio i s estimated t o remain above sustainable levels until
2005 b o t h in the Base Case and High Case scenarios. The high level o f external debt resulted f r o m the
accumulation o f arrears and new borrowing from multilateral and bilateral lenders. Under both the base
cases the NPV o f debt-to-revenue ratio does not fall below 200 percent until 2007. In the Base Case, debt
service i s projected t o remain w e l l above 35 percent o f revenue until 2009. Moldova’s prospects for longt e r m debt sustainability are hampered by l o w fiscal revenue and dependence over external financing. To
reduce the risk o f future debt distress the Moldovan authorities must implement their development
strategy and obtain continued concessional support. Furthermore, the Government has t o carefully assess
the impact o f n e w lending o n the medium-term capacity o f payment.

MOLDOVA: PORTFOLIO STATUS

1.
As o f mid-October 2004, the Moldova portfolio comprised 11 ongoing investment projects
totaling US$146.2 million (including one GEF-funded grant o f US$5 million), ,of which US$106.2
m i l l i o n i s undisbursed. The average age o f the portfolio i s 2.9 years, ranging from 3 credits approved in
F Y 0 4 (Energy 11, Supplemental Credit for Rural Investment and Services Project, and Social Investment
Fund 11) to 4 projects over 6 years o l d (Private Sector Development 11, First Cadastre, Social Investment
Fund I,
and Social Protection Management) and expected to be completed in FY05. The Youth Inclusion
Credit approved in F Y 0 4 failed to get ratification from Parliament due to the opposition from the leading
Communist faction. The loan was cancelled in August 2004.

2.

Infrastructure comprises almost h a l f o f portfolio in the sectoral composition (water supply,
energy, cadastre and Transport and Trade Facilitation in South Eastem Europe (TTFSE)), while human
development (health, social protection, Social Investment Fund, and A I D S Control), private sector
development, rural and social development (Rural Investment and Services Project (RISP), and Global
Environment Facility (GEF) constitute the other half.
3.
There i s currently one problem project in the portfolio; Social Protection Management, with
major implementation delays in key components due to weak Govemment commitment to pension
reforms, with some reversals in already agreed actions. These have undermined the development
objectives o f project, leading to an unsatisfactory rating. Active dialogue i s ongoing to address the
problems. Overall, the portfolio i s performing well, with implementation o f most projects proceeding
smoothly. However, a number o f projects, may not be able to attain sustainable outcomes, if timely
interventions are not undertaken to improve the quality at exit. In addition t o the Social Protection
Management project, the General Education, Cadastre Development, and Private Sector Development I1
projects, all closing in FY05, face policy and institutional challenges that may undermine sustainability o f
the investments.

4.
In preparation for the new CAS, the Bank undertook a strategic review o f Moldova portfolio in
October-November 2003. The objectives o f the review were (a) assess the development effectiveness o f
the portfolio, i t s overall riskmess and alignment with the existing CAS, (b) identify major processing
bottlenecks and recommend measures to facilitate and accelerate implementation o f projects, (c) identify
strategic management issues and propose recommendations that will help focus the supervision effort in
the years ahead.
5.
The review found out that IDA’Sintended lending activity in Moldova has been generally well
aligned with the three pillars o f the C A S (macroeconomic sustainability and growth, private sector
development and public sector reform). However, despite the good match between project and CAS
objectives, the contribution o f the portfolio to the CAS measured in terms o f impact and outcome has
been modest.
6.
Overall, ownership i s considered weak although it varies substantially fi-om project to project, and
across the various levels o f government. SAC I11 was poorly supported at the most senior Government
levels, while the SIF enjoys broad support at local as well as central government levels. Ownership tends
to be weaker when reforms supported pose a significant challenge to vested interests.

7. Lack o f institutional, economic and/or financial sustainability was identified as the major issue for the
portfolio. Among the main reasons are: (i)poor governance, lack o f ownership, and institutional
weaknesses, (ii)
the overall poverty level and l o w level o f cost recovery from users and beneficiaries; (iii)
the weak fiscal situation o f the Govemment, which can only assure l o w levels o f cost sharing followed by

Attachment 2

l o w levels o f operations and maintenance financing after projects are completed; a n d (iv) poor structural
reform environment.

8.
Findings and recommendations o f the strategic review o f the portfolio served as a basis for the
annual Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) conducted jointly by the B a n k and the Moldovan
Government in January 2004, with broad participation o f the Bank, Government, Project Implementing
Units (PIUs), donors and representatives o f c i v i l society. The CPPR was held in a format different f r o m
earlier review meetings, in a more participatory manner whereby three discussion groups looked at
systemic issues that are impeding successful implementation and reaching development objectives, and
focused o n outcomes and sustainability o f the entire portfolio. The issue o f more effective coordination
and decision-making, among stakeholders and among government agencies, was also discussed. The
CPPR’s new format was considered a success, and started some important discussions among
stakeholders about ownership, impact o n the ground and the need for better coordination o f efforts to
ensure the development effectiveness o f the country assistance program. In April 2004, the Bank and the
Government agreed o n an Action Plan t o put into practice the recommendations o f the CPPR, including
holding regular j o i n t G o v e m m e n t h n k reviews (every 3-4 months) t o l o o k at the k e y issues in the
portfolio and track implementation o f the action plan. Capacity building o f the clients in procurement,
disbursement and monitoring and evaluation, and regular meetings o f a l l Project Implementation Units
(PIUs) are intended t o address the issues and bottlenecks that impede successful projects implementation.
9.
Activities already taking place as a result o f the CPPR include video conferences with the L o a n
Department to clarify disbursement issues, the first Trimestral Review meeting in June 2004 t o take stock
o f implementation o f the Action Plan as w e l l as review the status o f individual projects, and a training
course n o w under implementation for project staff to strengthen M&E. In October 2004, the Government
established a Technical Committee for Monitoring and Evaluation o f IDA-financed Projects, w h i c h i s
chaired by the Ministry o f Economy and i s comprised o f high-level officials f r o m various ministries and
agencies. The Committee had i t s first meeting in October to discuss issues relating t o several ongoing
projects and decide o n h o w to resolve outstanding problems.
10.

Among the areas identified to enhance outcomes and sustainability are institutional strengthening
and capacity building, key governance issues, more realistic outcome and sustainability objectives,
promoting the Community-Driven Development (CDD) approaches, and increasing ownership at various
levels o f government and c i v i l society. Continued close monitoring and corrective actions by the
Government and the Bank o n the interrelated issues o f development outcomes, sustainability, risks, are
planned to ensure expected outcomes. For ongoing and n e w projects, closer attention will be paid t o the
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) aspects o f a project, including the selection o f appropriate M&E
indicators for measuring development outcome.

11.
With decentralization, Procurement and Financial Management Specialists have been posted in
the Regional Office in Kyiv, which has facilitated quick responses and better cooperation. The L o a n
Department’s processing o f withdrawal applications was decentralized to the Moscow-based regional hub
starting January 5, 2004. The initial analysis o f the effects o f this decentralization i s encouraging - the
average processing time for a withdrawal application has been reduced by 4.5 days in the first 3 months
since the decentralization.

MOLDOVA: LINK TO MDGs AND COUNTRY STATUS VIS-A-VIS MDGs

1.
The EGPRSP recognizes the strong link that exists between economic growth and poverty
reduction. Between 2000 and 2002, an average growth rate o f 5 percent allowed for a reduction in a
poverty headcount from 71 percent o f the population to just under 49 percent o f the population. T o
achieve the MDG goal o f eradicating extreme poverty, the EGPRSP envisages a move away f r o m the
current consumption-led growth paradigm towards a more sustainable growth platform that emphasizes a
more enabling and deregulated business environment, leading to increased investments and exports. The
EGPRSP suggests that growth rates between 5 and 10 percent are feasible. As the analysis underlying the
recent World Bank poverty assessment suggests, a sustain annual growth o f 3 percent will be sufficient
for Moldova to achieve the MDG target o f halving poverty by 2015. The table below compares the
current situation in Moldova with the ECA region as well as world averages o n the MDGs.
2.
The vital role that education plays in changing the quality o f economic growth i s highlighted in
the EGPRSP. Despite the hardships endured in the last decade, Moldova has managed to maintain high
levels o f participation in the compulsory years o f school. Net enrollment rates in the four years o f
primary school are about 97 percent, while enrollment rates in lower secondary school are also high at 92
percent. With regard to the MDGs, a Moldova specific target i s under consideration that stipulates
universal access for all children during the gymnasium cycle (i.e., compulsory cycle. grades 1 to 9). The
EGPRSP and the associated Education for All initiative have established a number o f targets, including
increasing enrollment o f children 3-5 years o l d to 75 percent, and 6-7 years o l d to 100 percent, and
reducing disparities between urban and rural areas to less than 5 percent, and reducing disparities between
the disadvantaged groups and median population. These targets also include ensuring that a l l children
have access to basic education (1 year compulsory pre-school, and 9 compulsory grades for gymnasium)
that i s o f high quality. Challenges to achieving these targets arise from less than universal attendance for
the first and last years o f compulsory schooling and from differences in the quality o f education for
urban-rural areas. Improving the quality o f educational services and enhancing access t o education,
particularly by the poor and disadvantaged groups, are among the issues the EGPRSP hopes to address.
3.
Moldova has succeeded in gradually reversing the population’s deteriorating health status since
the mid-1990s. Under age 5, mortality has been steadily declining, from 25 per 1,000 live births in 1990
down to 18.3 in 2002, while infant mortality has declined f i o m 23.9 per 1,000 live births in 1994 to 14.8
in 2002. Matemal mortality in Moldova has declined from 52.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1993 t o
28 in 2002 and has remained relatively stable since. However, compared to the outcomes achieved in
other European countries, and even some CIS countries, Moldova continues to lag behind in many health
indicators. The EGPRSP recognizes that further deepening o f the reforms in health care w o u l d be
required to achieve the MDGs in Moldova. Moreover, increased access, particularly for the poor t o basic
health services, as well as improved quality and standards o f medical services, would be required to
achieve the MDGs. Over the longer term, the effective implementation o f mandatory medical insurance
i s the principal means by which Moldova will seek to reform the health care system and improve health
care.

4.
The health o f the population i s also affected by inadequate access t o quality water supply and
sanitation. The EGPRSP estimates that, as a result o f the deterioration in the water and sanitation
infrastructure, over 50 percent o f the population i s using water that does not comply with sanitary norms.
F o r rural areas, this estimate extends to nearly 70 percent o f the population. Sanitation and wastewater
treatment are also inadequate, with only 55 percent o f the population in urban areas having access t o a
public sewage system. The EGPRSP has set out t o develop and modernize the water supply and sewage
systems in 156 localities and t o develop 93,300 rural wells.

CAS CONSULTATIONS PROCESS
SUMMARY FEEDBACK FROM CIVIL SOCIETY AND BUSINESS COMMUNITY
“Thefact that we have all met here can be considered a success, because in this way, the
World Bank gets closer to the entrepreneurs, and this should be the beginning of the
collaboration between the World Bank and the entrepreneurs of the Republic of Moldova. ”
A Partichant at the World Bank Consultations

1.
The Civil Society consultations included representatives o f academia, non-governmental
organizations, non-parliamentary political parties, the media, and trade unions. The discussions were
lively and heated at times, manifesting a wide variety o f concerns and interest as described below.

A strong p i t c h was made for increasing the role and participation o f NGOs in development
discourse. They requested specifically to be informed o n the Bank’s relations with the Government, and
t o have regular consultations with the Bank o n W o r l d Bank-financed operations--“Only access of the civil
society to adequate information will help us influence, in one way or another, the Government in
implementing the projects under the CAS. If we don’t have access to this information, we obviously
cannot help in any way to improve this strategy.” Further, they expressed the desire that more Bank
resources be channeled directly t o NGOs in rural areas. “The Bank should not only consult with civil
society, but also start working directly with it through different projects and programs”.

2.

3.

Concerns were raised regarding the weak legal framework, especially for businesses. “Citizens
and business need more equitable legal representation; access to justice needs to be more commonplace,
and attorneys and NGOs need to be empowered ”. As a corollary, concerns about corruption and the need
for transparency were raised. They requested support t o establish transparent systems o f transactions;
reduce the cost o f doing business; remove internal barriers that limit export capacity by influencing
government policy and eliminate corruption. Further, they requested support t o build the capacity o f c i v i l
society groups and t o support competent NGOs to consolidate and sharpen their skills in engaging local
authorities and communities in rural areas

4.
The discussions also centered on issues o f social protection, social services, and the environment.
Specific concerns were raised o n the need t o improve the quality o f education in the rural areas, as w e l l as
the need for technical assistance for the creation o f vocational schools to stem the tide o f out migration.
Further, concerns were raised regarding the poor quality o f emerging institutions o f higher learning and
the need for Bank assistance in addressing the problem. Bank support was also requested for
improvements in medical services. On the environment, participants indicated that “the biggest
ecological problems are in the rural area and it is very important that the strategy of the World Bank be
oriented towards the rural area, including support to ecological and rural tourism”.
5.
Finally, participants would like the W o r l d Bank t o contribute t o making the conditions for the
democratic process more propitious. They voiced the concern that ”...it is only through reforms, a state
of law, judicial independence, and a liberalized economy can we evolve as a democracy”. They also
want the Bank’s assistance in integrating with the EU “..this would solve the problem of poverty and of
Transnistria and lead us into our future ”, participants said.

6.
The Business Community consultations included participants f r o m the private (both local and
foreign entrepreneurs), the Banking and financial sectors, and state owned enterprises. The key message
that emerged from the discussions was that the main goals o f the CAS should be t o initiate and support
the second wave o f reforms in Moldova.

Attachment 4

7.

A strong p i t c h was made for Bank support for private sector development, particularly support for
S M E development and private investment promotion in the country. The Bank should “help bring direct
foreign investments into the country for private sector development and not by giving credits to the
authorities ”

8.
Of concern t o many participants was the development o f rural areas. Diversification o f business
and micro financing were proposed as a means o f eradicating rural poverty, with support f r o m the Bank in
the form o f start-up capital and replication o f modern cooperative structures in the agricultural sector.
Participants expressed the view that productivity o f the workforce i s dependent upon many factors, such
as the quality o f education, communications, modern health services, an improved natural environment,
investments in hydroelectric and thermoelectric power stations; all o f which they said are critical for
poverty reduction in Moldova.
9.
A number o f participants made a strong pitch for Bank support for infrastructure rehabilitation, in
particular the rehabilitation o f the 25-30 year o l d infrastructure. “Without the improvement of roads, we
cannot speak of economic growth and poverty reduction. A serious support is needed for the
transportation domain ”. Some participants argue, however, that such support must b e channeled through
the private sector and c i v i l society, not through the government and state enterprises.
10.
Participants expressed the view that the country needs economic stability and long-term sources
o f credits with l o w interest rates to the private sector t o promote growth. In this regard, a number o f
participants voiced the concern that continuous modifications o f tax laws and changes in taxes pose
serious impediments to emerging businesses. Further, they indicated that the complex regulatory
procedures, requiring several documentations for each transaction, dissuade investors and make the cost
o f doing business exorbitant. Participants also expressed concerns about export barriers. “Export
barriers, either legislative or of other kind, are not set in an objective manner in Moldova”. They also
raised concerns that external barriers t o exports were major impediments for M o l d o v a exports. “Unfair
competition in traditional and emerging markets curtails serious growth efforts ”, said participants. T h e y
expressed the need for Bank support to implement international acceptable standards for M o l d o v a n
exports.
11.
On governance, consistent with views expressed by the c i v i l society, participants felt that
corruption i s a major obstacle. “The law has to be equal for everybody. n e Bank can make the
Government become more transparent through financial, political, and structural pressure”. They also
indicated that governance o f Bank-financed operations have in thepast been weak, and welcome recent
efforts at closely monitoring the portfolio.
12.
Public debt was also a concern. “The World Bank could help with the relief of Moldova’s debts,
but impose some conditions on the Government ”. Knowledge was expressed as important. “Our c o u n t y
needs knowledge. We need skilled technical assistance in order to improve and increase the potentials of
our national capacity of analyzing and forecasting ”.
13.
Overall, the business community views the Bank’s strengths as disseminating the experience o f
developed countries and assisting in establishing trade networks. “Public information, education, and
communication on political, judicial, and economic issues are much needed for getting the peoples’
support for reforms.
14.
Finally, they expressed the need for a continuous dialogue with international financial institution
(IFIs). It was their hope that continuous f l o w o f information between the IFIs, M o l d o v a n business
community and c i v i l society would more readily assist the country in accelerating the transition to a
market driven economy.
