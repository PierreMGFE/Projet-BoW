EXECUTIVE S U M M A R Y

i.

The proposed FY05-07 C A S builds on FY02-04 Transitional Support Strategy (TSS)
program and i s designed to support the implementation of the European Union (EU)
Stabilization and Association process (SAP) and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
Serbia and Montenegro (SaM) - formerly the Federal Republic o f Yugoslavia (FRY) - succeeded to
the membership o f the former Socialist Federal Republic o f Yugoslavia (SFRY) in the Bank in M a y
200 1. Since then, Bank Group assistance has been provided through a TSS program, supporting the
Government’s efforts to transform SaM into a market economy and to l a y the foundation for
sustainable medium-term growth. Building on the TSS program, the new C A S supports the
implementation o f two complementary government strategies: the SAP and the PRSP. Together,
these strategies present a comprehensive reform agenda designed to achieve sustainable long-term
growth and poverty reduction, with the ultimate goal o f European integration. W h i l e the issues and
challenges are presented in different ways in the two strategies, this reform agenda can be
summarized in the three broad, inter-related medium-term country (and republican) goals around
which the C A S i s built:

>

Goal 1: creating a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector;

>

Goal 2: creating a larger, more dynamic private sector; and

>

Goal 3: reducing poverty levels, and improving social protection and access to public services.

ii. While S a M has made good progress o n macroeconomic stabilization and structural

reform over the past four years, further fiscal adjustment and renewed efforts on structural
reforms are necessary to bolster macroeconomic stability and lay the foundation for sustainable
growth. Building o n earlier reform efforts, particularly in Montenegro, the country launched an
ambitious reform program in early 2001 aimed at macroeconomic stabilization, rapid transition to a
market economy, the normalization o f relations with foreign creditors, and integration with regional,
EU and world markets. Although progress in some areas was slower than desired, implementation o f
this reform program, together with substantial donor support, has helped to sustain positive economic
growth since 2000. At the same time, however, there i s cause for concern, particularly with respect to
the growing current account deficit (which has increased from 3.9 percent o f GDP in 2000 to a
projected 10.7 percent of GDP in 2004) and the resurgence o f inflationary pressures in 2004 (inflation
i s projected at 12-13 percent in 2004). Addressing these issues and meeting the three country goals
o n which the CAS i s built will require a high quality fiscal adjustment (with cuts in the public sector
wage bill, subsidies and net lending, and transfers) coupled with an acceleration and deepening o f
structural reforms, including restructuring and privatization.

iii. Against this background and consistent with SaM’s goals, the C A S will support far-

reaching structural reforms in the public and private sectors, while seeking to ensure that
poverty i s reduced, social protection i s adequate and appropriately targeted, and access to
social services b y the poor and vulnerable i s improved. T o ensure a self-sustaining economy and
fiscally sustainable public sector in the medium and long term, the CAS program strives to help the
republican Governments to strengthen institutions (with institution and capacity building embedded
in all planned activities) and to reduce the weight o f the public sector in their economies. This i s a
prerequisite for giving the private sector room to grow, thereby stimulating productive activity,

1

domestic private and public savings, and export growth. In Serbia, the Bank’s efforts will
concentrate on parallel Programmatic Development Policy Loan (PDPL) programs, one focused o n
public sector reform (including public administration reform and pension reform) and the other o n
private sector development (including enterprise and financial sector restructuring and privatization
and energy sector reform). The measures envisaged under the PDPL programs, and development
policy support in Montenegro, together with other assistance from the W o r l d Bank Group (WBG) and
complementary assistance from other development partners, should, if implemented effectively,
translate into economic growth and employment creation.
iv.
I n recognition of the unusual country circumstances and the success of the IDA program
to date, SaM’s exceptional and temporary eligibility for IDA resources on modified terms has
been extended to FY05-07 to allow for the establishment of credihrorthiness for limited IBRD
borrowing, thereby facilitating a smooth transition from IDA to IBRD. At the same time,
however, the amount of IDA resources allocated to SaM over the C A S period i s envisaged to be
much lower than the US$540 m i l l i o n three-year TSS envelope, making the establishment o f
creditworthiness for limited IBRD borrowing essential to ensure adequate lending resources to assist
S a M in meeting the three country goals o n which the C A S i s built. The IDA envelope for the FY0507 C A S period i s expected to be US$225 million. If creditworthiness i s established, these funds
w o u l d be supplemented by US$175 m i l l i o n o f IBRD lending under the base case and US$325 m i l l i o n
under the high case, bringing the total base and high case IDNIBRD lending envelopes to US$400
m i l l i o n and US$550 million, respectively.
v.
I n addition to lending and AAA from the Bank (IBRD and IDA), the CAS program
envisages continued strong support from IFC. IFC’s program will complement the Bank’s
program by focusing o n development o f the financial sector, post-privatization support to selected
enterprises, private sector participation in infrastructure, and private sector investments in selected
sectors. In infrastructure, for example, IFC will work closely with the Government and the Bank to
explore opportunities for private sector financing through public private partnerships, provide
technical assistance and pre-privatization support, and help public sector entities attract private
investment through i t s Balkans Infrastructure Development Facility. I F C will also continue i t s large
donor-supported technical assistance program that aims to enhance the development impact o f i t s
investment activities; improve the business environment for SMEs; assist domestic companies in
meeting EU standards; facilitate the development o f domestic financial markets through institutionbuilding and the use o f innovative financial products; and provide restructuring and privatization
support.

While SaM i s vulnerable to exogenous shocks, the main risk over the CAS period i s
slippage on the reform agenda, which could, in turn, complicate the medium-term
macroeconomic and growth outlook. The political will to implement difficult reforms in both
republics remains highly vulnerable to the shifting relations within the respective ruling coalitions, as
well as to relations between the t w o republics. This political commitment will be tested over the
C A S period in both republics by the need t o undertake measures that result in durable cuts in noninterest current expenditures, while increasing public investment. Compounding the impact o f SaM’s
complex political economy o n the pace o f reforms are significant capacity constraints o n
implementation o f economic legislation and regulations. Against this background, guarding against
“reform fatigue,” while maintaining strong progress o n reforms necessary to underpin fiscal
sustainability and sustainable medium-term export-led growth, will be essential t o maintain the
momentum o n the reform agenda. Other factors that could complicate the reform process over the
C A S period include a potential referendum o n the continuation o f the state union, developments in
Kosovo and southern Serbia, failure to satisfy k e y partners o n the depth and pace o f cooperation with
vi.

11

the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, vested interests at all levels o f
government (including local and municipal governments), and additional complexities arising from
new, constitutionally-mandated, state-level structures.
vii. These risks notwithstanding, SAM’s impressive track record of solid policy performance
in the wake o f important political events bodes well for the outcome o f the overall reform
program during the CAS period and for building the level of confidence essential to fostering
growth and investment. Based o n this experience, despite formidable challenges ahead, slippage o n
major components of the reform agenda i s considered unlikely. Ongoing engagement o f the
international community, especially in the form o f an increasingly robust portfolio o f long-term
lending, will help t o ensure continued progress. At the same time, focusing WBG assistance at the
republican level i s appropriate given the uncertainties surrounding the duration o f the state union o f
Serbia and Montenegro.

Memorandum to the Executive Directors of the IDA and IBRD
Country Assistance Strategy (FY05 - 07)

I.Introduction

-

-

1.
Serbia and Montenegro (SaM) formerly the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)
succeeded to the membership o f the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)
in the Bank’ in M a y 2001.’ Initial Bank Group support was provided in two stages. The f i r s t
phase provided pre-membership support o f US$30 million through the World Bank Trust Fund for
FRY (TFFRY). The second phase, outlined in a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), provided a
three-year program o f support for the Economic Reconstruction and Transition Program (ERTP),
financed through a temporary and exceptional IDA allocation o f US$540 m i l l i ~ n .In
~ addition,
over this period, IFC provided commitments o f US$43 m i l l i o n in support o f private sector
development. TSS Updates in 2002 and 20044 described progress o n implementation and laid out
annual lending plans.

2.
The proposed FY05-07 C A S i s built on the two complementary government strategies
(shared b y both republics): the European Union (EU) Stabilization and Association process
(SAP) and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). With a shared ultimate objective o f
EU integration, these two strategies present a comprehensive reform agenda designed to achieve
sustainable long-term growth and poverty reduction. This reform agenda can be summarized in
three broad, inter-related medium-term country goals: (i)
creating a smaller, more sustainable,
more efficient public sector; (ii)
creating a larger, more dynamic private sector; and (iii)
reducing
poverty levels and improving social protection and access to public services. The CAS aims to
support the authorities in achieving these goals through a carefully selected mix o f Bank (IBRD
and IDA) and I F C financing and other World Bank Group (WBG) activities.

11. Country Context-Progress

since the Transitional Support Strategy

A. Political Background and Recent Developments

.

3.
I n February 2003, FRY completed a constitutional transition to the state union o f
Serbia and Montenegro. In l i n e with the February 2002 Belgrade Agreement and the 2003
Constitutional Charter (Charter), a state union composed o f the Republic o f Serbia and the
Republic o f Montenegro was established with a common presidency, parliament, council o f
ministers, and foreign and defense policies. The union provides for republican autonomy in most
areas o f economic policy, including currencies, central banking, and tax regimes. Also, it was
anticipated that the republics would implement separate, but partly harmonized, trade and customs
regimes with a view towards eventual integration with Europe.

The “Bank” refers to the IBRD and IDA; the “World Bank Group” refers to the Bank, IFC, FIAS and MIGA.

* On March 14,2002, an accord (“Belgrade Agreement”) setting out the general framework for a union between the Republic

of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro was signed by federal and republican authorities. Under this accord, on February 4,
2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) completed a constitutional transition to the union of Serbia and Montenegro
(SaM). All historic references to FRY may be considered to refer to SaM. T h i s CAS does not cover the province o f Kosovo,
which remains under UN administration according to UN Security Council Resolution UNSC-1244.
See Transitional Support Strategy (R22090-YU, June 26,2001).
See Transitional Support Strategy Updates (R24476-YU, July 18,2002, and R2704S-YU, February 18,2004).

4.
The requisite union-level institutions were reconfigured or established, including a
parliament, a n d the union has been operational since the Charter was effected. The provisos
of the Belgrade Agreement allow for a referendum on continuation o f the union after three years o f
implementation, and some key figures have indicated a desire to put the issue to a referendum. T o
date, union-level parliamentarians were elected by party representation. Direct elections for the
parliament are slated for early 2005, but various constituencies advocate advancing a referendum
on union continuation, rather than holding union-level elections.
5.
Since M a r c h 2003, the Republic of Serbia has undergone a series of elections (three
presidential, two parliamentary, and one municipal legislative and mayoral). In June 2004, in
a third round o f presidential elections, Boris Tadic, a pro-western reformer, was elected President
of the Republic o f Serbia. Since then, President Tadic has set about realizing h i s pledge to get
Serbia ready for EU membership, stressing the need for broad-based reforms to stimulate private
sector development and encourage foreign direct investment. Although President Tadic’s
Democratic Party (DS) has not joined the ruling four-party minority coalition, i t has maintained
generally good working relations with the coalition, supporting some key elements o f the reform
agenda in parliament. However, early in the fall, differences o f views o n the question o f ethnic
Serb participation in the October elections in Kosovo strained relations between the D S and Prime
Minister Vojislav Kostunica’s Democratic Party o f Serbia (DSS). Despite a difficult political
backdrop and weak administrative capacity, the governing coalition has managed to maintain
remarkably strong policy performance.

6.
At the local level, voters went to the polls on September 19, 2004, to elect deputies for
148 municipalities. Mayors o f Belgrade, N o v i Sad, N i s , and Kragujevac were contested for the
first time through direct elections. These elections were particularly significant given the increased
autonomy and power that the new L a w o n Self Administration grants to the municipalities. The
D S and the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) received the highest shares o f the votes. Serbia’s new
Constitution i s in the final drafting stages and i s expected to be submitted for parliamentary
approval in early 2005 (the adoption process could be protracted, however, as a two-thirds majority
in parliament i s required as w e l l as a referendum). Serbian parliamentary elections are expected to
be held after the adoption o f the new Constitution, but could be advanced.
7.
Since 2002, Montenegro’s ruling coalition has held a dominant position, while the
opposition parties have boycotted parliament. Since early fall, there has been some
movement toward the opposition’s return to the legislature. Despite the Government’s strong
parliamentary base in 2004, the reform agenda has advanced more slowly than expected. While
some important pieces o f legislation have been enacted, policy has tended to be formulated o n an
ad hoc basis. Most domestic attention has been focused o n harmonization disputes with Serbia and
independence prospects, with some political leaders calling for early negotiations with Serbia o n
the future o f the state union. Montenegro’s new constitution i s scheduled for parliamentary
submission in 2005.
8.
In addition to the question of the durability o f the state union, other pressing challenges
during the C A S period include realizing significant progress on the SAP. This process has
stalled due to problems with the functioning o f the state union and lack o f action on the internal
Market and Trade Action Plan (see Annex l ) , as well as political uncertainty stemming from the
parliamentary and presidential elections in Serbia. Recently, the EU endorsed a “twin track”
approach to SaM, indicating willingness to deal directly at the republican level o n issues relating to
trade, customs, and economic and sectoral policies, within the overall framework o f the state union.
This should help to reinvigorate progress o n the SAP agenda (see paragraphs 23-24). SaM faces
two additional challenges. First, the depth and pace o f cooperation with the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) i s currently considered inadequate by some k e y
2

partners, leading to some delays and reductions in donor assistance programs. Second, the
challenge o f KOSOVO’S
final status remains to be determined, all the more pressing in view o f the
resurgence o f violence in Serbia and Kosovo in March 2004.

B. Recent Economic Developments
9.
S a M began the 1990s relatively well integrated with the world economy, and with a
higher standard of living than many other transition economies. However, armed conflicts,
international sanctions, and trade shocks stemming from the break-up o f the Socialist Federal
Republic o f Yugoslavia (SFRY) during the 1990s had a detrimental effect. Combined with
economic mismanagement, these events resulted in hyperinflation and a virtual collapse o f the
economy. By 2000, recorded per capita GDP had fallen to below one h a l f o f i t s 1989 level.
Foreign trade volumes also f e l l noticeably, while the country experienced chronic high inflation.
Real earnings declined significantly, with absolute poverty roughly doubling since 1990; social
protection and health services deteriorated as available financing fell below entitlement levels; and
external debt grew to 132.6 percent o f GDP in 2000 (reflecting both arrears accumulation and the
fall in GDP discussed above).
10. Progress on structural reforms has generally been good. By early 2001, both republics
had embarked on strong reform programs. Indeed, in January 2001, the country launched an
ambitious program aimed at a rapid transition to a market economy, the normalization o f relations
with foreign creditors, and integration with regional, EU, and world markets. The Government’s
(SaM) economic program rested on three pillars: (i)
prudent macroeconomic policies; (ii)
marketoriented structural reforms; and (iii)
the mobilization o f significant financial and technical support
from donors. In addition to establishing macroeconomic stability, progress made o n this agenda
includes opening the economy, restructuring the banking sector, and adopting legislation in many
areas aimed at harmonization with the EU. Nonetheless, the remaining reform agenda i s
substantial. Indeed, a report, entitled “Recent Progress o n Structural Reforms,” prepared by the
Bank for the Donor Coordination Meeting in November 2003, identified the following areas where
progress has been slower than desired: (i)
improving the private sector incentive framework; (ii)
strengthening the productive, financial, and infrastructure sectors; and (iii)
reforming the public
sector.
11. Macroeconomic stability, good progress on structural reforms, and significant donor
support have helped to sustain positive economic growth since 2000. Following a sharp
contraction in 1999, owing mainly to the Kosovo conflict, SaM’s GDP grew by 5.5 percent in 2001
and 4 percent in 2002.5 However, real GDP growth slowed to 3 percent in 2003 (compared with a
program target o f 3.5 - 4.5 percent) for two main reasons. First, implementation o f structural
reforms and overall economic activity were adversely affected by political uncertainty resulting
from the assassination o f Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic in March 2003 and the decision to
h o l d early elections in December 2003. Second, agricultural output suffered because o f the
drought in northern Serbia, while industrial output growth was dampened by pre-privatization
uncertainties, coupled with insufficient investment and a general lack o f competitiveness. GDP
growth i s expected to recover to around 6 percent in 2004, bolstered by a recovery in industry (due
to accelerated privatization in 2003), strong growth in services, and a rebound in agricultural
output.

12. Despite positive growth, unemployment in Serbia has increased. Similar to the
experience o f other countries in transition, Serbia has experienced the problem o f “jobless growth.”
This phenomenon mainly reflects labor hoarding during the 1990s that, as a result o f ongoing
Serbia accounts for about 93 percent of SaM’s economy.

privatization and restructuring efforts, has been converted into open unemployment. The Labor
Force Survey (LFS)-based unemployment rate increased slightly from 9.6 percent in 2000 to 11.1
percent in 2002.6 Based on preliminary data from the LFS for 2003, this increase appears to have
been sustained. Registered unemployed i s much higher than suggested by the LFS, reflecting
incentives to register at the Labor Market Bureau. Importantly, registered unemployment started
declining in 2003 for the first time since the late 1980s.
13. The exchange rate-based stabilization program has been very effective in reducing
inflation, but inflationary pressures increased in 2004. Retail price inflation declined from
113.5 percent in 2000 to 14.2 percent in 2002 and further to 7.6 percent in 2003. Although the
nominal exchange rate o f the dinar to the D W E u r o remained broadly stable and unified during
2001 and 2002, i t depreciated (appreciated) against the Euro (USD) by 11.1percent (7.4 percent) in
2003 compared to end-December 2002. As a result o f higher electricity prices, more flexible
exchange rate policy,’ rising o i l prices, and increases in excise taxes, inflation i s projected at 12-13
percent in 2004. The credibility o f program implementation will determine whether the adverse
impact o f the one-off factors will be permanent or temporary.’
14. Fiscal performance - gauged b y meeting the program targets under the IMF supported
economic program - has been favorable (see Table 1). The consolidated budget deficit o f 1.4
percent o f GDP in 2001 was considerably lower than the program target o f 6.1 percent o f GDP.
The target o f 5.7 percent o f GDP for 2002 was also comfortably met. SaM’s 2003 fiscal deficit o f
3.2 percent o f G D P was 1.3 percent o f GDP below the target under the IMF program, due to slower
than expected disbursement o f grants and foreign financed projects.

15. Between 2001 and 2004, the country has experienced large current account deficits
following the resolution o f the regional conflict and removal o f international sanctions. The
combined effect of disappointing export performance and rapidly growing imports (which grew by
an average o f 28.7 percent per year in U S dollar terms during 2001-03) l e d to an increase in SaM’s
current account deficit (after grants) from 3.9 percent o f GDP in 2000 to an estimated 9.6 percent
of GDP in 2003.9 During this period, capital inflows were larger than the current account deficit,
particularly in 2003 when net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, driven largely by
privatizations, were exceptionally large. As a result, foreign exchange reserves rose to US$3.6
billion (4.4 months o f projected 2004 imports) in 2003 from a negligible level 3 years earlier.
The unemployment rate in Serbia i s s t i l l above the levels o f well-performing economies, such as Hungary, Slovenia, and the
Czech Republic, and also above the average for OECD and EU countries. Moreover, the surveyed unemployment rate i s likely
to be somewhat underestimated, as i t does not cover redundant workers who perceive themselves as employed and declare
accordingly in surveys.
In nominal terms, the dinar depreciated by 14 and 4.1 percent in October 2004 (year-on-year) against the Euro and the USD,
respectively.
In response, the National Bank o f Serbia raised i t s mandatory reserve requirement for commercial banks from 18 percent to
21 percent starting from August 11, 2004.
Saki’s exports in 2000 were less than 43 percent of 1989 levels, suggesting that exports are clearly well below potential
levels. In spite o f this significant catch-up potential, export growth has been sluggish.

’

SaM’s external and public debt position has also improved primarily due to Paris and London Club
agreements (achieved in 2002 and 2004, respectively) and an increase in dollar GDP. Public debt
declined to a projected 65 percent o f GDP in 2004 from 123.2 in 2001 (see paragraphs 114-1 16).
16. As a result of the combination of higher oil prices, a surge in-imports, and slow growth
o f exports during the first eight months of 2004, the current account deficit projection for
2004 i s revised to 10.7 percent of GDP. In response to unfavorable external developments and
rising inflationary pressures, the Parliament o f Serbia adopted a re-balanced budget for 2004 in
October, which represents an important step towards reducing public consumption. Primarily as a
result o f expenditure cuts, these revisions reduced Serbia’s planned central government budget
deficit in 2004 to 2.5 percent o f Serbia GDP from 3.9 percent in 2003. The draft budget for 2005
suggests that fiscal policy will continue to remain tight in 2005. The shift to taxing consumption
instead o f income will be continued with the introduction o f the VAT in January 2005 and the
removal o f some small taxes. Measures will also be taken to improve compliance and taxpayer
services. Finally, the size o f the Government will be reduced also by cutting, and improving the
efficiency of, current expenditures, while allowing higher capital spending and a lower tax burden.

C. M e d i u m - T e r m Economic Outlook and External Financing Requirements
17. Under the base case scenario, SaM’s medium-term prospects are favorable, with
continued progress on key reforms leading to projected GDP growth averaging 5.1 percent
per annum in 2004-07 (see Table 2). The base case scenario assumes: (i)
a high quality fiscal
adjustment (based on durable non-interest expenditure cuts) that enhances macroeconomic stability
and boosts confidence in the policy framework, thereby stimulating private investment; and (ii)
an
acceleration o f policy efforts aimed at improving efficiency, including privatization and enterprise
restructuring, along with measures directed at improving competition and the investment climate.
18. Non-interest current expenditures in relation to GDP are projected to decline from
roughly 41.3 percent in 2004 to 35.5 percent in 2007 (just under 2 percentage points o f GDP per
annum). In addition to reductions in purchases o f goods (around 0.3 percentage points o f G D P per
annum), this decline primarily reflects reductions in the wage bill, subsidies, net lending, and
transfers (see paragraphs 28-30). The wage bill as a share o f GDP could be reduced by around 0.30.5 percentage points per annum, supported by public administration reform and reforms in the
main sectors o f public employment, including health, education, defense, and internal security.
Roughly h a l f o f the remaining 1.2 percentage point per annum decline in non-interest current
expenditures as a share o f GDP could come from cuts in subsidies and net lending, with the other
h a l f coming from reductions in transfers. Cuts in subsidies and net lending will result from, among
other things, restructuring and, where appropriate, privatization o f large loss-makers, including
railways, and from reforms o f budget-financed lending institutions such as the Development Fund.
Reductions in transfers are expected to result from a variety o f measures, including those designed
to improve the financial sustainability o f the pension and healthcare systems.

19. Together with adjustments on the revenue side and an increase in public investment,
these cuts in public expenditure as a share o f GDP will contribute directly to promoting
growth and redressing macroeconomic imbalances. During the CAS period, further efforts to
improve tax collection (supported, among other things, by implementation o f bankruptcy
legislation) and increase transfers f r o m profitable state-owned enterprises should boost public
revenues. As the current high tax burden (tax revenues as a share o f GDP) remains a barrier to
private sector-led growth and to formalization o f economic activity, any such gains in revenues are
expected t o pave the way for corresponding reductions in tax rates, particularly o n labor. Together
with the adjustment in public expenditure discussed above, this should have a positive impact o n
expectations about the future stance o f fiscal policy, thereby lowering the r i s k premium and paving
the w a y for higher private investment. By the same token, public investment, which has been low,
i s expected to increase during the projection period. In this way, the projected fiscal adjustment
will be the cornerstone o f the country’s efforts to l a y the foundations for enduring growth and
macroeconomic stability over the medium term.

20. Greater confidence will help to reverse the projected increase in inflation in 2004, while
an improved public savings-investment balance, coupled with structural reforms, i s expected
to have a favorable impact on the current account balance. With greater confidence in the
policy framework (reflecting, among other things, thq envisaged fiscal adjustment) and prudent
monetary policy, inflation i s projected t o decline steadily t o 4 percent in 2007. At the same time,
improvements in the public savings-investment balance and in the competitiveness o f the economy
should help to reduce the current account deficit (after grants) f r o m 10.7 percent o f GDP in 2004 to
6

7.6 percent by 2007. Gross domestic savings as a percentage o f GDP would rise to -1.3 percent in
2007 from -8.6 percent in 2004.
21. SaM's financing requirements under the base case scenario are projected to remain
high, partly because of rising debt service payments (see Table 3 and paragraph 114-116).
Between 2004 and 2007, gross external financing requirements are projected at about US$12.8
billion. These resources are required to finance: (i)large but declining current account deficits
(excluding grants and official transfers) amounting to roughly US$8.8 billion; (ii)
an increase in
international reserves o f US$1 billion; and (iii)
amortization o f external debt amounting to US$3
billion. With the envisaged improvement in the fiscal balance during the projection period, these
financing needs will shift from the public to the private sector, as the expected fiscal retrenchment
will leave more room for the private sector to tap domestic and foreign markets at favorable terms.
FDI i s projected to finance 33 percent o f total needs in 2005-07, while long-term loans from
multilateral, bilateral, and other creditors are projected to account for 35.7 percent. The remainder
will be covered by other capital inflows (short-term credits, capital not-elsewhere included, and
errors and Omissions'O).
22. While good policy performance i s expected under the base case, based on strong
implementation of ambitious reform plans, both republics expect to move to a high case
scenario in terms of policy performance as early as possible in the CAS period (in addition to
strong policy performance, access to IBRD lending would depend o n establishment o f
creditworthiness for limited IBRD borrowing - see paragraphs 107-108). Under this scenario, the
growth rate in 2006 and 2007 would accelerate to 5 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively, as
broader and deeper reforms lead to a stronger private sector response. This scenario also foresees
deeper cuts in non-interest current spending in 2006 and 2007. These developments would also be
consistent with stronger export performance and a more favorable external position. Overall, under
this scenario, S a M w o u l d be in a stronger position to achieve a virtuous cycle o f higher investment,
savings, productivity, and hence GDP growth.

111. Medium-Term Challenges

A. The Governments’ Programs
23. The republican Governments’ reform programs are built on implementation o f two
complementary strategies: the SAP and the PRSP.” With a shared ultimate objective o f EU
integration, these two strategies present a comprehensive reform agenda designed to achieve
sustainable long-term growth and poverty reduction. W h i l e the issues and challenges are presented
in different ways in the two strategies, the reform agenda envisaged under the SAP and the
PRSP - and, hence, the Governments’ programs - can be summarized in the three broad,
inter-related medium-term country (and republican) goals:

P Goal 1: creating a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector;
P Goal 2: creating a larger, more dynamic private sector; and

P Goal 3: reducing poverty levels, and improving social protection and access to public
services.

24. SAP. The SAP agenda i s very broad, encompassing political as w e l l as economic criteria
and reforms (see Annex 1). SaM i s in the early stages o f the process. Among other things, this
reflects difficulties in resolving harmonization issues between the two republics, including the
creation o f a single internal market. The “twin track” approach recently endorsed by the EU i s
intended to break this logjam by dealing with each republic individually o n economic and trade
policies, while dealing with the union o n issues such as international political obligations and
human rights, all within the context o f an eventual single agreement with SaM. A Feasibility Study
on the opening o f negotiations o n a Stabilization and Association Agreement i s expected to be
completed in early 2005. Deepened regional cooperation i s also an important element o f the SAP
(see B o x 1).
25. In addition to maintaining macroeconomic stability, the SAP envisages economic reforms in
the following k e y areas.
Public sector reform: Ensuring effective functioning o f the state and financial viability o f
state institutions; reform o f the army and electoral law, public administration reform including
reform o f the civil service pay system, and preparation o f comprehensive anti-corruption
strategies; formalizing the grey economy, and broadening the tax base and implementing the
tax reform package, including VAT; establishing an effective public procurement regime; and
developing reliable statistics.
Private sector development: Liberalizing remaining prices and removing administrative
controls; speeding up restructuring, privatization a n d o r liquidation, developing a stable and
functioning landreal estate market, and developing and implementing a comprehensive
strategy to promote employment and combat unemployment; abolishing export duties and
import levies and modernize customs; and improving business registration.

The PRSP, which was completed in late 2003, comprises a union-level overview and a PRSP for each o f the two republics
and builds on the Interim PRSP for FRY (presented to the Boards o f I D A and o f the IMF in August 2002 - Report No. 24490YU and EBD/02/118, 7/24/02). T h e republican PRSPs contain detailed policy matrices indicating the time frame for
implementing reforms and are broadly consistent with other Government strategic plans. For Montenegro, this includes the
Agenda of Economic Reforms, while, for Serbia, it includes Serbia on the Move.

Box 1: S a M and South Eastern Europe
A regional perspective on trade, energy, transport, environment, water resource management, and other areas o f
potential mutual interest can benefit all South Eastern Europe (SEE) countries, especially through improved
prioritization o f infrastructure investments (see Annex 2). Deepened regional co-operation i s also an essential
element o f the SAP. Over the past few years, considerable progress has been achieved in t h i s area as indicated by
the increasing number o f bilateral trade agreements between the countries o f SEE, as well as the detailed
agreements o n the integration o f the region’s energy systems. SaM i s actively engaged in a number o f regional
initiatives and programs, foremost among them the Stability Pact,I2 including the Working Tables on
democratization and human rights; security issues; and economic reconstruction, development, and cooperation.
The Bank i s actively involved in the latter. The development o f regional infrastructure in SEE - connected and
compatible with existing and planned trans-European networks within the EU - i s important to support overall
economic growth, improvement in the quality o f life, and social cohesion in the region. The Infrastructure
Steering Group for SEE (ISG), overseen jointly by the E C and the Bank, aims to ensure that both the SEE
countries and the international community take a regional strategic approach to infrastructure development. The
ISG addresses particular needs in the areas o f transport, energy, water, the environment, and cross-border or trade
facilitation. This CAS supports regional cooperation through numerous Bank studies, initiatives, and activities
undertaken at the regional level.

26. PRSP. The SaM PRSP lays out an overall strategy for poverty reduction aimed at improving
living standards for the poor through reforms focused on establishing the conditions for dynamic,
‘equitable growth (see B o x 5 on SaM’s poverty profile). Within this overall framework, in addition
to eventual accession to the EU and World Trade Organization (WTO) membership, the
republican-level PRSPs share core objectives in line with the three medium-term country goals
outlined above: (i)
public sector reform consistent with macroeconomic stability and development
o f a market economy; (ii)development o f the private sector through h r t h e r privatization o f
financial and productive assets and improvements in the business environment; and (iii)
poverty
reduction (based o n strong poverty diagnostics), improvements in the effectiveness o f social
programs, and attainment o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs, see Annex 4).
27. In addition to the overall policy challenges involved in implementing the Governments’
programs and country goals discussed below (see paragraphs 28-62), PRSP-specific
implementation challenges include improving costing, establishing clear linkages with the
republics’ budget processes, and strengthening the framework for PRSP implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation (including identifylng indicators for reporting o n progress). W h i l e
implementation progress since the PRSPs were completed in late 2003 has been slow in both
republics, recent developments are more promising, in part because o f development o f stronger
links with the SAP (see B o x 2). Building o n this momentum will require renewed interest in the
PRSP o n the part o f the international community, including provision o f financial support for
PRSP implementation.

l2T h e

Stability Pact was formed by more than 40 countries and organizations at the initiative o f the EU after the Kosovo crisis.

I t encourages SEE countries to develop common perspectives in numerous social, political, and economic areas.

Box 2: PRSP Implementation in Serbia and Montenegro
Serbia. After a strong start, implementation languished for several months following the parliamentary elections.
Recently, however, momentum was restored when the Deputy Prime Minister's Office assumed responsibility for
the PRSP fimction, which i s to be coordinated with EU integration, allowing for improved linkages in policy
formulation. Near-term priorities include: (i)
developing the linkages with the SAP - in particular, development
of a joint action plan for five to six sectors aimed at fostering improved intra-ministerial communications; (ii)
developing a framework for monitoring and evaluation, including a template o f objectives and indicators for
public discussion and use; (iii)
continuing the participatory process through local level activities with civil society
organizations; and (iv) organizing o f a PRSP Conference aimed at, among other things, better public
dissemination o f the PRSP.
Montenegro. The Government has been active in promoting the PRSP concept in the media, and there i s interest
in improving the budgetary linkages. There have also been favorable developments in terms o f better linkages
reactivating the Expert Task Force to work with the
between the S A P and the PRSP. Near-term plans include: (i)
Ministry o f Finance o n budget linkages; (ii)holding participatory conferences aimed at strengthening
organizing consultations with other regional
prioritization and disseminating lessons from experiences; and (iii)
PRSP teams.
Financial Support. While adequate during the development phases, fmancing for PRSP implementation i s
proving problematic in both republics. In addition to support from DFID and UNDP, PRSP preparation was
financed through a Multi-Donor PRSP Trust Fund, administered by the Bank. In Montenegro, the two donor
grants supporting implementation have been depleted and the sole bilateral grant will not be extended. The
Montenegrin Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, which oversees the effort, has been able to cover short-term
operational costs, but lacks resources to provide the expertise necessary to start the prioritization process and to
link the PRSP to the annual budget. U N D P continues to support the process through i t s on-the-ground presence.
Although a request for a second grant from the Multi-Donor PRSP Trust Fund to support implementation in both
republics i s planned, increased support from the international community w i l l be necessary to sustain the process
over the medium term.

B. Challenges in Meeting Country Goals
28. Both republics will face considerable challenges in implementing their reform programs and
meeting the three country goals. The discussion below highlights the main issues under each o f the
three goals.
G o a l 1: Creating a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector

29. The overall challenge in terms o f public sector reform in S a M i s to reduce public
expenditure as a share o f GDP while ensuring adequate levels of public investment. While
SaM has made good progress in containing the accumulation o f hidden fiscal deficits (particularly
budgetary arrears and losses in the energy sector), consolidated public spending has steadily
increased, reaching a projected 45.3 percent o f GDP in 2004 (Box 3).13 This threatens growth and
macroeconomic stability by: (i)
keeping taxes and interest rates high, thereby crowding out private
reducing
activity, discouraging private investment and encouraging the informal sector; and (ii)
fiscal flexibility. SaM therefore needs to implement fiscal adjustment based o n durable cuts in
non-interest expenditure while ensuring adequate public investment (which i s currently l o w as a
share o f GDP and often used as an in-year balancing item).

Increases in wages and transfers were the key contributing factors to the rapid expansion o f government expenditure.

30. Efforts to reduce public expenditures as a share o f GDP should focus on: the public
sector wage bill; subsidies and net lending; and social transfers; particularly pensions and
healthcare. The level o f spending as a share o f GDP o n each o f these underlying structural
components i s higher in SaM than for other countries in the region (Box 3). The public sector
wage bill, which has been growing rather than declining since 2001, accounted for 10.5 percent o f
GDP or 22.6 percent o f total spending in 2003. As core wages are low, this high level o f spending
primarily reflects the large number o f public employees. Budget subsidies and net lending, both o f
which increased in 2003, are also significant contributors to the high level o f public expenditure at
around 4.3 percent o f GDP in 2003. W h i l e the level o f subsidies in the budget has increased since
2001, this reflects the introduction o f more transparent budget management with a shift away from
off-budgetary expenditures. Social transfers at around 20 percent o f GDP are close to the level o f
wealthier countries, raising affordability concerns. Within social transfers, the two most important
areas are the pension and healthcare systems.
3 1. Addressing these underlying structural sources of high expenditure will require strong
progress on structural reforms. Reducing the public sector wage bill will require public
administration reform, together with deep reforms in the main sectors o f public employment,
including health, education, defense, and internal security. Reducing subsidies and net lending will
require accelerated progress on restructuring and, where appropriate, privatization o f large loss
makers, particularly railways. Reducing social transfers will require b o l d measures to improve the
sustainability o f the pension and healthcare systems. Against this background, the key structural
reforms to be addressed under Goal 1 o f the CAS are: (i)
public administration reform; and (ii)
pension reform. Restructuring and privatization will be addressed under Goal 2, and healthcare,
including financing issues, will be addressed under Goal 3.
Public administration reform

32. Progress on public administration reform in Serbia has so far been limited. l4 Lack o f
political consensus o n administrative reform measures has stymied necessary institutional reforms,
resulting in continued major distortions in staffing numbers in individual sectors, politicization o f
key positions (often down to head o f department level in ministries), a highly compressed and
inadequate remuneration system based o n years o n service and ad hoc benefits, and reliance on
donor-funded temporary expert staff to overcome capacity constraints. These weaknesses in public
administration, which have been further exacerbated by implementation o f the Belgrade Agreement
and the Constitutional Charter, affect the quality o f state administration and the continuity o f i t s
work over time, and create a strong disincentive for highly quality staff to stay in the c i v i l service.
Overcoming these weaknesses will improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f public
administration, and contribute to macroeconomic stability by reducing the public sector wage bill
and to private-sector led growth by building a strong independent regulatory management system.
In addition, public administration reform i s essential to facilitate much-needed economic and social
sector reforms.
33. The medium-term agenda in Serbia i s substantial. Necessary medium-term reforms
include: (i)right-sizing the administration through a comprehensive review o f the needs o f
individual sectors; (ii)de-politicization; (iii)reform o f the pay and benefits system; (iv)
modernizing the legal basis for operation o f the c i v i l service and public administration; (v)
l4
I t i s generally recognized that weaknesses in the institutional systems in both republics w i l l seriously affect the design and
implementation o f economic and social reform programs if a substantial improvement in the quality o f public administration
systems i s not achieved. Furthermore, unreformed administrative systems will continue to impose a high fiscal burden, as
salary and wage costs as a percentage o f GDP remain among the highest in Europe, especially in Montenegro. Finally, the
objective o f integration into European structures o f both republics requires radical progress in institutional reform if
institutional capacity criteria for EU membership are to be met in the mediumto long term.

12

modernizing the regulatory management system; (vi) enhancing accountability in the public
administration; and (vii) re-allocating hnctions across levels o f government.
The new
Constitution, currently under preparation, will help to set the framework for some o f these reforms
by clarifying the administrative structure o f the republic, settling some key issues in central-local
government relations, and creating the basis for the adoption and implementation o f k e y
administrative reform legislation. Given fiscal constraints, the reform o f the salary system will
need to be accompanied by retrenchment efforts.
34. The Government of Montenegro launched an ambitious, comprehensive public
administration reform process in 2003, in response to growing distortions in public
administration, which led to wage costs as a share o f GDP spiraling to among the highest levels in
Europe. Significant progress has been made, particularly in terms o f the legislative framework.
Laws o n State Administration and Inspection Scrutiny were enacted in mid-2003. The former
foresees the reform o f the structures o f ministries, with policy-making fimctions to be separated
from service delivery and regulatory functions, while the latter sets out modern principles and
procedures o f inspection oversight o f public administration, private companies, and citizens. In
addition, Laws on General Administrative Procedures and o n Administrative Disputes (Judicial
Review) were enacted in October 2003, and Laws o n Civil Service and o n Salaries were adopted in
April 2004. The latter two laws provide the legal basis for establishment o f a professional, meritbased c i v i l service system, including de-politicization o f appointments below the level o f Assistant
Minister and Secretary-General, and de-compression and modernization o f the pay system.
35. While good progress has been made over the past year, the agenda remains substantial
and continued efforts will be required over the medium term, as demonstrated by the number
and scope o f initiatives currently under way. These include gradual implementation o f the new
salary system beginning with the 2005 budget, including initial steps on wage de-compression;
implementation o f the new human resource management system (including performance-based
assessment); mandatory regulatory and policy fiscal impact analysis with a plan to expand
coverage to include environmental, economic, and social impact analysis; and, with the a i m o f
reducing abuse o f office and corruption and creating a more responsive client-oriented
administration, establishment o f an Ombudsman’s office and an administrative court and special
appellate court.
Pension reform

36. Further pension reform i s also essential to improve fiscal sustainability in both
republics and to make room for better targeted social protection programs. Social protection
spending in both republics i s dominated by pensions (accounting for more than 12 percent o f GDP
in Serbia). The pension system in Serbia, which i s supposed to be financed by employer and
employee contributions, requires budgetary transfers to cover more than h a l f o f i t s expenditures,
while less than two-thirds o f the elderly are even receiving pensions and an even smaller
percentage o f the current labor force i s contributing to the pensions system. Pension expenditures
in Montenegro are 13 percent o f GDP and contributions cover less than 60 percent o f expenditures,
given the 2004 reduction in contribution rates. This level o f expenditure distorts labor market
decisions and jeopardizes fiscal sustainability, as w e l l as crowding out other forms o f social
expenditure that could be more targeted towards the poor. B o t h republics undertook significant
pension reforms in 2002-03: raising the retirement age, widening the calculation period, lowering
accrual rates through a points-based formula, tightening the indexation mechanism, eliminating
non-pension benefits, tightening disability eligibility, and eliminating temporary disability.
However, these reforms notwithstanding, the pension systems continue to carry significant deficits.

13

37. This i s particularly true in Serbia, where the Government i s looking for additional ways
to improve the sustainability of i t s pension system. Over a five year period, the reforms already
being implemented are expected to reduce the burden o f the pension system by 2 percentage points
o f GDP, leaving a deficit that will need be financed from the central budget in the absence o f
increases in contributions or further reforms. Expenditures are expected to decrease the pension to
GDP ratio below 10 percent in the next 7-10 years due to a slower inflow o f new pensioners, less
generous indexation, and the impact o f expected real wage growth coupled with declining inflation.
Further improvements in financial sustainability will require additional parametric reforms,
improvements in both collections and enforcement, and, at a minimum, administrative
consolidation o f Serbia’s three pension funds. I t i s important to note, however, that, while
extremely important, these measures will not have a substantial positive impact o n the pension
deficit in the near term. Together with the measures already taken, improvements in collections
and enforcement, coupled with parametric reforms such as moving to inflation indexation o f
pensions after retirement and raising the retirement age for women, could lower the deficit from i t s
current level o f more than 5 percent o f GDP to less than 2 percent o f GDP by 2020. Efforts to
establish the legislative, administrative, and supervisory framework for a multi-pillar system should
also be continued alongside the measures discussed above with a view to introducing second and
third pillars in the medium to long term.
38. Additional pension reform may also be necessary in Montenegro. The pension deficit as
a share o f GDP was slightly lower than in Serbia at 3.9 percent o f GDP in 2002. As outlined
above, significant reforms were introduced in late 2003. These changes could lower the pension
deficit to less than 1 percent of GDP in 2006 and could eliminate the pension deficit by 2009.
However, the impact of these reforms i s somewhat uncertain due to the lowering o f the
contribution rate in 2004 and the envisaged transfer o f collection responsibilities to the Department
o f Public Revenues in 2005.
Goal 2: Creating a larger, more dynamic private sector
39. Achieving Goal 2 will require progress in a number o f difficult areas. First, a package o f
reforms - including continued privatization, enforcement o f hard budget constraints, improvements
in the business environment, and continued financial sector reform - i s required to reduce the size
create a favorable
o f the public sector in economic activity (thereby also contributing to Goal l),
environment for the development o f the private sector, and improve the competitiveness o f
domestic companies. Second, restructuring, and eventually privatization, o f the energy sector i s
needed to address financial sustainability (thereby also contributing to Goal 1) and improve the
reliability o f energy supplies. Third, reforms are required to boost agricultural production and
improve the competitiveness o f farmers and ago-processors, particularly in EU markets. Fourth,
further progress on cleaning up and protecting the environment i s necessary to ensure quality
economic growth over the medium term.
Enterprise andjhancial sector reform

40. Good progress has been made in both republics on enterprise and financial sector
reform since 2001. Despite a difficult sales environment, the tender and auction privatization o f
socially-owned enterprises has made good progress. The authorities have also made substantial
improvements in the legal and institutional fi-amework aimed at efficient entry, operation, and exit
o f enterprises. In parallel, important steps have been taken towards rebuilding the financial
architecture through liquidation o f deeply insolvent banks, restructuring o f banking sector arrears,
privatization o f state-owned banks, and updating o f the regulatory framework for the banking and
insurance sectors. Despite these achievements, however, SaM i s near the bottom o n indicators o f
enterprise sector reform progress, such as the Bank’s “Cost o f D o i n g Business,” suggesting that
14

m u c h remains to be done. Similarly, the financial sectors in both republics remain underdeveloped
by regional benchmarks, with the existing level o f financial intermediation being unable to fully
contribute to the economic growth agenda.

4 1. Resolution of state- and socially-owned enterprises to be completed. Enterprise data
show that new private and privatized f i r m s clearly outperform state-owned enterprises. Firms in
pre-privatization limbo face little incentive to search for new markets, restructure their production,
or create new and more secure jobs. Financial and organizational restructuring and subsequent sale
o f troubled industrial conglomerates, or viable parts thereof, needs to be speeded up. Unsaleable
loss-making conglomerates should be subject to bankruptcy procedure under the new insolvency
laws in the respective republics.

42. Financial discipline needs to be strengthened to enhance restructuring and to attain
permanent fiscal adjustment. This i s crucial to: (i)
encourage poorly performing f i r m s to push
ahead with restructuring, thereby releasing factors o f production (non-core assets) to higher
productivity users; and (ii)
encourage viable enterprises to actively search for new markets and
reduce costs (including maintaining wage increases in line with productivity growth). These
objectives can be achieved through: (i)
phasing out direct and indirect subsidies, including the
Development Fund and forbearance o f arrears; (ii)effective implementation o f bankruptcy
legislation; (iii)
continuation o f the unbundling and restructuring (workforce and debts) o f public
utilities; and (iv) establishment o f an adequate regulatory framework in infrastructure sectors,
paving the way for private sector participation in management, financing, and ownership o f
infrastructure. Sustainable fiscal adjustment i s impossible without permanent restructuring and
privatization o f the real sector (in parallel with public administration reform) because, as
experience in ECA shows, un-restructured large (“too big to fail”) enterprises continue to lobby for
subsidies and crowd out the private sector.
43. The business environment needs to be further improved. This will facilitate the smooth
movement o f the factors o f production from l o w to high productivity enterprises, allowing these
f i r m s (including foreign-owned firms) to expand their production. The main challenges in
improving the business environment are: (i)strengthening contract enforcement by updating
relevant legislation and enhancing the capacity o f courts; (ii)improving access to credit by
establishing an institutional and legal framework conducive to lending operations; (iii)
reducing the
regulatory burden on enterprises through public discussion o f draft laws and removal o f
overlapping functions o f various state authorities; (iv) improving access to land by changing the
constitutional treatment o f urban land, removing administrative barriers, resolving the issue of
restitution, and establishing a modern cadastre system; and (v) improving infrastructure,
particularly water, energy supply, and solid waste disposal.
44. Accelerated reform and modernization o f financial sector should proceed in parallel
with reforms of the real economy and business environment. The current domination o f
Serbia’s financial system by inefficient and problem-laden local banks, many o f which are stateowned, presents significant risks and limits the potential for intermediation for the real sector o n a
sustainable and affordable basis. Based o n the experiences o f other transition economies, Serbia
needs speedy, yet transparent, privatization o f state-owned banks to strategic investors through
open tenders. Those banks that cannot be sold and/or are unlikely to compete effectively even if
their balance sheets could be cleaned up will need to be merged or liquidated. The challenges for
Montenegro include the completion o f divestiture o f state-owned banks and the resolution o f nonperforming assets accumulated in the system. In parallel to the resolution o f state-owned and nonperforming assets, authorities in both republics need to establish and enforce stronger regulatory
and supervisory discipline across the whole o f the banking sector, with a view to minimizing
vulnerabilities and promoting further consolidation. Finally, legal and institutional foundations
15

should be laid f o r development o f viable non-bank financial institutions, with a particular focus on
insurance sector reform.
Energy sector reform

45. Improving the performance of the power sector i s also essential to underpin fiscal
sustainability and encourage private sector-led growth (see Box 4). Good progress has been
made in this regard in Serbia since early 2001. First, tariffs have been steadily increased accompanied by appropriate social welfare measures - and n o w cover operating costs plus debt
service and depreciation. Average (residential, commercial, and industrial) power tariffs were
increased from 0.9 U S c/kWh in January 2001 to 4.2 U S c/kWh in July 2004. Second, residential
collection rates have increased to around 92 percent and efforts are being made to improve
collections from industrial consumers through restructuring and privatization. Third, a new Energy
L a w was passed in July 2004. This law will unlock the industry reform process, most notably
through enabling the establishment o f an energy regulator and the restructuring o f energy
companies. Fourth, progress has been made o n commercialization o f the electricity utility
Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) by spinning o f f non-core assets (including coal mines).
Box 4: S a M Electricity Sector and ECSEE
An important development i s the EC-sponsored, and Bank-supported, initiative to establish the Energy
Community o f South Eastern Europe (ECSEE), focusing on electricity and natural gas. SaM i s a signatory o f the
“Athens Memorandum,” which launched the process for the establishment o f ECSEE, together with Albania,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, KOSOVO,
the former Yugoslav Republic o f Macedonia (FYR
Macedonia), and Turkey. The E C and the Stability Pact also signed the Memorandum as i t s sponsors. The
participants have agreed to adopt rules relating to the organization and functioning o f the electricity and gas
markets designed to facilitate competition and ensure that access to networks i s non-discriminatory, transparent,
and fairly priced. The markets are to be based on the principles set out in the Electricity Directive, the Gas
Directive, and other legislation relating to the operation o f the EU’s Internal Energy Market, including
environmental legislation.

A recent Bank-sponsored study has shown that electricity shortages could develop in the region unless significant
investments are made in installing new generation capacity, rehabilitating existing aging capacity, and upgrading
transmission networks. SaM could benefit significantly from the creation o f ECSEE. I t s participation in the
regional energy market will improve the reliability o f supply, reduce the need for additional generation capacity,
increase security o f energy supply, and strengthen incentives to connect the Balkan region to Caspian and North
African gas supplies.

The on-going Serbia Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project, co-financed by nine donors, supports
SaM’s participation in ECSEE. In particular, investments under this project have included transmission network
rehabilitation and installation o f cross-border meters, both o f which were part o f the technical requirements for the
regional market. In addition, generation rehabilitation under the project will ease the near-term capacity deficit,
thereby also supporting the evolution o f competition. The institutional components o f the project have supported
reforms, including development of an energy law and restructuring o f the power utility, both o f which w i l l help
Serbia to comply with the requirements o f the Athens Memorandum.
The Bank intends to continue to play an important role in supporting SaM’s efforts to participate in ECSEE
beyond the completion o f the EEPP project, as well as through the Montenegro Emergency Power LIC, by
providing strategic advice and preparing regional projects to finance relevant priority investments. For example,
deficiencies that constrain SaM’s participation in ECSEE will be addressed under the planned Regional Energy
APL in Serbia in FY05 and in Montenegro inFY06.

46. Looking forward, the challenge i s to implement the new Energy Law, including
restructuring of EPS. T w o k e y components o f the Energy L a w are the establishment o f a sector
regulatory framework and restructuring o f EPS’s core business. The latter will involve separating
ownership o f power generation, distribution, and transmission, together with labor restructuring
16

(EPS i s currently overstaffed, as evidenced by l o w levels o f labor productivity). There i s also a
need for further improvements in payments discipline. Performance here (both as regards
collections and commercial losses) remains poor relative to Western European standards.
Necessary actions to support improvement in this area include power distribution network remetering; the development o f a billing, collection, and disconnection manual; and implementation
o f the existing Ministry o f Energy/EPS plan for reduction o f commercial losses. Further increases
in tariffs are also likely to be needed to finance investments in the medium term.

47. Good progress has been made in power sector reform in Montenegro; the big challenge
i s implementation. Most notably, an Energy L a w was enacted in June 2003 and an independent
regulator, which has already issued licenses for various energy companies, was subsequently
established. Tariffs have been increased to an average o f almost 5 US c/kWh (sufficient to cover
operating costs). Going forward, the challenge i s to build o n this progress through implementation
of the Energy Law, particularly as i t relates to Elektroprivreda Cme Gore (EPCG) restructuring.
The L a w envisages that EPCG will be unbundled in the first quarter o f 2005 and that power
generation, transmission, and distribution will function as separate entities. While there i s a need
to reform tariffs for large customers, the overall focus should be o n improved payments discipline
through increased collections, reductions in losses, and, in the case o f commercial customers, an
eradication o f payments through offsets. T o ensure that tariffs cover operating costs on an ongoing
basis, the regulator needs to develop secondary legislation o n tariff methodologies. In addition, the
Government should undertake an energy affordability study and introduce social protection
measures as required to protect poor and vulnerable groups.
Agriculture

48. A number o f difficult issues need to be tackled to realize the agricultural sector’s full
potential, particularly in Serbia. The contribution o f agriculture to GDP has increased over the
last 10 years. Primary agricultural production and ago-processing currently account for around 25
percent o f GDP, and agricultural products comprise about 26 percent o f Serbia’s exports. At the
same time, however, while farm land i s largely privately owned (86 percent), agricultural reform
has been relatively slow and there are significant barriers to realizing the sector’s full potential. In
particular, public and private institutions associated with agriculture need to be strengthened; the
necessary private markets for land, rural finance, and agricultural produce and inputs need to be
developed; reform o f trade and incentive policies needs to continue; agricultural competitiveness
needs to be improved, particularly in terms o f food quality and production costs; and the authorities
need to continue to tackle land registration and titling.
49. In 2004, the Government o f Serbia initiated several new programs o f rural assistance.
The agricultural credit scheme aims to encourage rural lending by commercial banks and to help
rural borrowers access financing by establishing credit histories. However, early feedback suggests
that there i s scope for increasing the effectiveness o f this program. The rural development grant
fund seeks to enhance the sustainability o f primary agricultural production, develop the rural
economy, and improve the livelihoods o f rural households through improved diversification of
income source^.'^ These schemes have been accompanied by introduction o f a farm registry, with
the eventual aim o f building, in l i n e with EU standards, a single payment agency. W h i l e
registration i s voluntary, only registered farms are eligible for rural development grants, subsidies,
and rural credits, and for receiving agricultural advice from the state agricultural extension system.
With EU funding, the Government also began a program o f upgrading veterinary, phyto-sanitary,
T h e fund provides partial grants (20 - 50 percent o f the value o f investments) for farm and marketing improvements and
village community development through non-agricultural economic activities, such as ago-tourism.

17

and food safety laboratories, training laboratory staff, and establishing a network o f regional animal
health, local food safety and phyto-sanitary laboratories.

50. Looking forward, the Government o f Serbia i s expected to focus i t s efforts on increasing
agricultural competitiveness and improving natural resource management. Agricultural
advisory services have an important role to play in improving competitiveness. In particular,
farmers need advice on: (i)
technical, management, and marketing skills; (ii)
EU food safety
standards; and (iii)
access to finance. In the short run, the Government intends to improve the rural
credit system and rural development grant fbnd (based on the EU model) and to reorient the
agricultural advisory system to focus o n the needs o f farmers and ago-processors in a competitive,
open market economy. Efforts to improve natural resource management, including flood and
drainage management, agricultural pollution reduction, and agro-biodiversity are also expected.
However, improvements in water resource management are essential to increase agricultural
productivity through rehabilitation o f the irrigation and drainage system; reduce land, crop,
property, and infrastructure damage through rehabilitation o f flood management infrastructure; and
strengthen the associated institutions.
Environmental management and protection

51. While considerable progress has been made in Serbia, the institutional and regulatory
framework needs to be strengthened and core environmental problems need to be tackled.
Environmental management continues to suffer from limited institutional capacity, overlapping
competencies, an inadequate legal framework, and a lack o f investment fbnds for core problem
areas. Completion and implementation o f the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) and
four Local Environmental Action Plans, along with a new set o f laws governing environmental
protection, environmental impact assessment, and pollution prevention and control, should help to
address some o f these weaknesses and lay the groundwork for overcoming core environmental
problems. The latter include solid and hazardous waste management; pollution o f surface and
groundwater sources by industrial, municipal, and agricultural sources; localized severe air
pollution near mines and power plants; deteriorating drinking water quality and lack o f adequate
sewerage (especially in poor urban settlements and rural areas); energy inefficiency; inadequate
forest and biodiversity management; and a threat to forests from uncontrolled cutting.
Enforcement o f new laws will be a significant challenge requiring stronger political commitment
and institutional capacity.

52. I n Montenegro, effective landscape and watershed management, including flood and
erosion control, are key to sustainable development o f tourism. Achieving this would,
however, require an improvement in institutional capacity, the legislative framework, and
enforcement, as would overcoming important environmental problems. The latter include air,
water, and soil pollution by a few large hotspot industries, mines, and plants; lack o f satisfactory
waste and waste water management; and unsustainable natural resource and coastal zone
management. As in Serbia, efforts, supported by donors, are underway to develop environmental
legislation in line with EU standards, but strong political commitment will be required for effective
enforcement.
Goal 3: Reducing poverty levels, and improving social protection and access to public
services

53. As outlined in the PRSP, in addition to robust sustainable economic growth, there are
three key challenges under Goal 3: (i)
combating rural poverty; (ii)
improving social protection
(excluding pension reform - discussed under Goal 1); and (iii)improving access to quality,
affordable health and education for all citizens, including poor and vulnerable populations. As
18

described in Box 5, poverty in both Serbia and Montenegro i s relatively shallow with a sizeable
portion o f population living “at r i s k ” o f poverty (50 percent above the poverty line). This profile,
together with experience from other countries in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), suggests that
robust, sustainable economic growth i s essential to reduce poverty. At the same time, however,
special attention i s required to address growing regional disparities; to improve the coverage,
targeting, and reliability o f transfers for social protection; and to improve the quality and financial
sustainability o f health and education for all citizens (see Box 6 for a discussion o f Roma issues).
Box 5: Poverty in Serbia and Montenegro
PRSPs and Poverty. Bank work on poverty in SaM follows a programmatic approach geared towards supporting
the PRSP processes within each republic. This work has several aims: (i)
collecting and analyzing representative
data o n living standards; (ii)
arriving at a diagnosis o f poverty shared by the authorities and the Bank; and (iii)
establishing adequate baseline data to monitor changes in poverty over time. The f i s t output o f the Bank’s
poverty program in SaM was the Poverty Assessment Report released in June, 2003 (Report No. 2601 1 YU). This
report i s being followed by a series o f analytical studies (covering rural poverty, ethnic dimensions o f poverty,
and poverty and the environment) and ongoing data collection to trace the evolution o f the risk o f poverty as well
as i t s specific characteristics and dimensions.
Poverty Incidence. In mid-2003, material poverty (defined as a consumption level below the country-specific
absolute poverty line) affected around 10 percent o f the population o f both Serbia and Montenegro. However, t h i s
favorable poverty profile reflects the Governments’ decisions to use the bottom o f the estimated range o f the
poverty line in order to focus their policies on the neediest. When the top o f the range i s used (in line with
common practice in Central and Eastern Europe), around 20 percent o f the population o f SaM i s poor. In
addition, proper accounting for marginalized groups (including Roma and internally displaced persons - IDPs),
who are under-represented in the regular household sample surveys, further raises the estimates o f poverty.
Poverty in SaM i s also relatively shallow: the economic recovery experienced by Serbia in 2002-03 reduced
absolute poverty by one-third.
Poverty Dimensions. The proportion o f the population “at r i s k ” o f poverty (those living just above the poverty
line) i s relatively high in both republics at around 20 percent. This suggests even small economic shocks can have
potentially large effects o n poverty. At the same time, non-income dimensions o f poverty are relatively good,
including decent housing, access to water and sanitation, and basic education, all o f which are within the reach of
the majority o f the poor. There are, however, important pockets o f poverty in which the population faces multiple
deprivations, notably the poor in rural areas and in new urban slums, as well as ethnic minorities and IDPs.
Moreover, poor households face serious problems accessing the healthcare system due to the burden o f informal
payments and the lack o f full health insurance coverage.

Who are the poor in SaM?

0

0

Two-thirds o f the poor have only primary (elementary) education. Multivariate analysis o f poverty risks
suggests that lower education attainment i s the key background factor explaining the higher incidence of
poverty for rural households and jobless households.
Jobless households (families with working age members where no one works) have more than twice the
average poverty incidence and are prone to chronic poverty. Working households (families with at least one
employed member) account for 75 percent o f the poor - “the working poor.”
Rural households have a higher incidence o f poverty than urban ones. Poverty incidence i s double the
national average in southern Serbia (and did not benefit from the 2002-03 recovery, thereby widening the gap
with the rest o f the country). In Montenegro, poverty incidence in the north i s twice the level in the
centerisouth.
Households with IDPs, refbgees, or ethnic minorities, especially Roma, experience high levels o f poverty.
Roma households are likely to experience high levels o f poverty o n all dimensions and suffer from persistent
chronic poverty.
While the risk o f poverty i s the roughly the same for male- and female-headed households, the latter are more
prone to the risk o f chronic poverty. Multivariate analysis suggests that this reflects less active participation
and fewer years o f experience in the labor market, as well as lower pay.

19

Rural poverty

54.
R u r a l poverty in S a M i s high and increasing. Rural poverty rates have doubled since
1990. As o f 2003, 75 percent o f all poor in Serbia live in rural areas, despite the fact that the rural
share o f the total population i s less than 45 percent. The problems o f rural youth are particularly
acute. Surveys indicate limited opportunities, a widespread pessimistic attitude (with a gap
existing between reality and expectations, and the risk o f anti-social behavior), a perception of

corruption in education systems, and participation in a grey economy, often including human
trafficking.

55. In addition, deteriorating r u r a l infrastructure i s contributing to public health risks and
rising costs o f transport for r u r a l communities. O f particular concern i s the quality and
reliability o f the water supply; surveys have indicated that the great majority o f rural water supply
systems do n o t comply with bacteriological standards and that nitrate pollution, caused by both
domestic waste water and agricultural activity, i s o f serious concern. Rural water supply services
are currently confronted with an institutional and legal vacuum, relying entirely o n a tradition of
self-reliance. Moreover, about 45 percent o f solid waste in rural areas i s inappropriately disposed
o f or dumped. As villages are often grouped with larger urban municipalities, local govemment
spending priorities m a y reflect urban, rather than rural, priorities.

56. While active assistance programs for the agricultural sector will help, a more broadbased approach to rural development will be required in the poorest regions. Encouraging
agricultural production and improving the competitiveness o f the agricultural sector will play an
important role in alleviating rural poverty, particularly in Vojvodina and Central Serbia (see
paragraphs 48-50). In the poorest areas o f the two republics, southern Serbia and northern
Montenegro, however, a more broad-based approach to rural development i s required to boost rural
livelihoods, improve access to services, and build an awareness and appreciation for the
environment and biodiversity.
Box 6: The Roma Decade in S a M
Roma constitute a large and vulnerable minority group in both Serbia and Montenegro. According to the 2002
Serbian census, Roma constituted 1.4 percent o f the population, while estimates by NGOs and international
organizations place the Roma population at about 4 percent o f the population. Approximately 20,000 Roma are
estimated to live in Montenegro. Roma in both republics are significantly poorer than the general population.
Estimated poverty among Roma in 2003 was 68 percent in Serbia, or 8 times higher than the total population, and
52 percent in Montenegro, or 4 times higher than the total population.
Roma poverty i s multi-faceted; more Roma are out o f work and more Roma children out o f school than in the rest
o f the population. In 2003, only 7 percent o f Roma children were in school. Housing conditions are also poor and
many Roma live in illegal settlements. Many Roma in SaM are IDPs from the Kosovar conflict. According to
UNHCR, some 40,000 to 50,000 Roma were forced to leave Kosovo in 1999. Living conditions for displaced
Roma are extremely poor and some municipalities have been reluctant to accept Roma IDPs.
In July 2003, Serbia and Montenegro participated in the first high level regional conference on Roma. Federal
Minister o f National and Ethnic Communities, Rasim Ljajic, and M i l o Djukanovic, Prime Minister of
Montenegro, participated and committed Serbia and Montenegro, along with seven other Central and South
Eastern European Countries to launch a Decade o f Roma Inclusion from 2005-2015. Working groups at the
republican and federal level, comprising govemment officials and Roma N G O leaders, have worked o n select
goals in the areas of education, employment, health, and housing that the republics will try to achieve during the
Decade. The Decade i s being coordinated with the Ministry for Minorities’ National Strategy for Roma, which
was adopted inApril 2004, and the PRSPs.

Social Protection

57. Further measures are needed in both republics to strengthen the social safety net to
protect the poorest households, including improved coverage and targeting of cash benefits
and a modernized system of social services for vulnerable groups. Both republics have moved
beyond addressing immediate humanitarian needs o f refugees and IDPs to systemic reforms
designed to support fiscal sustainability while continuing to provide core benefits and services to
the population. While some progress has been made, areas for further reform include: (i)
improving coverage through increased spending on some o f the more effective and better targeted
programs (especially, Material Support to Families (MOP)); (ii)
improving in the targeting and
administration of other programs that transfer resources to vulnerable groups (such as child
allowances, caregiver’s allowance, veterans and disabled allowances, and parental allowances); and
(iii)improving the effectiveness o f social services for vulnerable groups (including the
development o f standards, regulations, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and o f special
approaches for specific groups - children without parental care, young with behavioral problems,
disabled, elderly, and Roma). In addition, there i s a need to build capacity in local governments
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in developing and delivering services, thereby
improving access for poor and vulnerable groups, including Roma, IDPs, and refugees.
58.
I n Serbia, recent legislative reforms to extend the coverage of MOP need to be
accompanied by administrative reform and efforts at improving social service delivery. The
M O P program in Serbia i s well-targeted but coverage i s low. Recently completed legislative
reforms are designed to improve M O P coverage: (i)
establishing a uniform national eligibility
threshold for MOP; (ii)
indexing benefits to the cost of living; and (iii)
increasing benefit levels.
However, the results o f these changes will need to be monitored to ensure that they improve the
welfare o f the poorest households. Moreover, these legislative changes need to be supported by
further administrative reform, including building the capacity o f local governments to deliver
benefits and services and improving efficiency by consolidating the M O P program and child
benefits (currently delivered by different agencies). Improving the effectiveness and quality o f
social services, and shifting away from over-reliance o n institutional care, i s a core element o f the
republic’s PRSP. The Social Innovation Fund (SIF) i s a key instrument in this respect - i t i s a fasttrack social reform mechanism that aims to support innovative social service projects at the local
level and feed the results into policy development.
59. Montenegro introduced reforms in 2001 that improved coverage of the MOP, but
overall coverage remains low, targeting i s poor, and there are also serious problems with
payments arrears (around Euro 10 million, in addition to around Euro 6.5 million o f o l d arrears
on child allowances). The Government i s aiming to expand local government and NGO
involvement in social services - particularly t o further the development o f altemative,
community-based mechanisms for social care.

Health and Education

60. While recent progress in Serbia has been encouraging, reforms are needed to improve
the financial sustainability and affordability of healthcare, as well as service delivery. Despite
high public and total spending on healthcare (around 7 and 11 percent o f GDP, respectively), the
publicly-financed health system suffers f i o m chronic arrears16and other signs o f financial distress,
and access to healthcare by the poor i s limited by high out-of-pocket costs (in the 2003 Poverty
l6
Net accumulated arrears by the end of 2001 were CSD 6.7 billion (1 percent o f GDP). Deficits have been met through a
combination o f commercial loans, delays in payments to suppliers and providers, artificially l o w reimbursement prices, and
contractual revenues levels that do not ensure full cost recovery.

22

Assessment, over 30 percent cited high costs and lack o f insurance coverage as principal reasons
for lack o f access to healthcare services). Despite reductions in contribution and co-payment
exemptions, the level o f revenues to the Health Insurance Fund (HIF) i s l o w because o f the large
informal economy and administrative weaknesses, while budget transfers to cover healthcare for
vulnerable groups and rehgees have been grossly inadequate and poorly executed.” Issues in
service delivery include deficiencies in clinical and patient registration practices in primary
healthcare and capitation-based payments for primary health care providers.
6 1. In particular, further progress on establishing the legislative and institutional
foundations for health reform (including the development o f new framework laws o n healthcare,
health insurance, and pharmaceuticals) and on reforming the health insurance system are
necessary- a major challenge given weak institutional capacity. These measures can be
expected to provide a basis for addressing many o f the key challenges facing the sector, including:
a mix o f public and private healthcare provision; a gate-keeping role for primary care doctors;
patient choice o f provider; a licensing system for doctors; autonomy for the HIF; new provider
payment methods; a more rational approach to identifylng health benefits on the basis o f costeffectiveness; better monitoring o f prescriptions; and a pharmaceutical regulatory and procurement
system based o n principles o f competition, cost-effectiveness, and quality. However, the
institutional capacity to carry out this work i s limited, both in terms o f personnel and information
systems.
62. Montenegro has taken important first steps toward reform of the health sector, but
measures are required to improve both quality and financial sustainability. In 2003,
Parliament endorsed a health strategy that set the overall direction for reforms in the organization,
financing, and provision o f healthcare services. Framework laws on health care and health
insurance were subsequently adopted in 2004, and a revised l a w on medicinal products i s currently
under public discussion. However, as in Serbia, total health spending i s high (about 11 percent o f
GDP) and Montenegro’s HIF runs arrears (accumulated arrears in 2003 totaled Euro 12 million).
This reflects high pharmaceutical expenditure, an unaffordable benefits package, and provider
payment methods that lack efficiency incentives. Health insurance contributions - until recently
the mainstay o f health finance - were reduced in 2003 as part o f the Government’s efforts to
improve the investment climate for SMEs, thereby increasing reliance o n budgetary transfers. l8
Improving the reliability and timeliness o f budget execution i s therefore critical to reform efforts
and essential to the financial stability o f the HIF. Failure to improve financial sustainability could
result in an increase in out-of-pocket payments and deterioration in access, which would
disproportionately affect poor and vulnerable populations. T o address these issues, the authorities
are preparing a medium-term finance program for the health sector for 2005-2007. Although the
recent strengthening o f financial and technical capacities in the HIF,19 together with the ongoing
promotion o f a comprehensive, technically sound primary health care reform agenda, portend well,
full implementation o f reforms i s necessary to ensure quality, affordable healthcare.
63. As outlined in the PRSP, fighting poverty means providing people leaving the education
system with better skills and targeting education sector resources in favor o f disadvantaged
groups in both republics. The k e y challenge i s to improve the overall efficiency and quality o f
l7 T h e amounts required for covering vulnerable groups in 2004 was estimated at CSD 5.9 billion, while the budgetary
allocation was only CSD 2.83 billion. Data from Q1 2004 showed that actual transfers were running 75 percent below
budgeted amounts for the quarter, raising concerns about the timeliness and completeness o f budget execution.
T h e 2003 cuts were compensated b y a combination o f expenditure cuts by the HIF and the promise o f increased budget
transfers from the Ministry o f Finance. The reliability o f budget transfers to the HIF has historically been poor, especially on
behalf o f refugees and vulnerable groups.
l9
A number o f expenditure control measures have been successfully introduced over the past 18 months, including a
tightening o f dental, sick leave, and treatment-abroad benefits; a new pharmacy information system; and a first attempt at
international tendering for drugs.

education, while improving the financial sustainability o f recurrent expenditure. In addition,
improving the skills and knowledge o f those leaving education (especially those leaving at the end
o f secondary education given the high rates o f unemployment among this group) and developing
incentives to increase adult education and training will make a significant contribution to Goal 2,
the creation o f a larger, more dynamic private sector.

64. Effective leadership i s key to tackling education reforms in both republics. Some o f the
k e y issues in one or both o f the republics include: exceptionally high arrears (estimated as high as
50 percent o f the total public education budget in Montenegro); administrative inefficiencies
(including a large number o f small schools in Montenegro); emerging but under-utilized
information systems; ineffective professional development practices; secondary education
programs that provide only limited vocational training; inadequate infrastructure and equipment;
and a fragmented higher education system characterized by l o w rates o f on-time graduations.
Moreover, the considerable challenges facing the sector are made more complex by the presence o f
strong teachers’ unions advocating for higher wages and benefits. In Serbia, progress o n education
reform has slowed since late 2003 because o f political uncertainty and policy disagreements. In
Montenegro, by contrast, the Government i s pursuing a strong reform strategy, including staff
reductions and measures to address Roma issues.

IV. W o r l d Bank G r o u p Assistance Strategy
A. Progress U n d e r the TSS Programs and Lessons Learned
65. The FY02-04 TSS for FRY provided a substantial program o f support to the new
democratic Government elected to office with a mandate to pursue modernization, market
economy reforms, and international reintegration. The TSS set out an overarching framework
for a three-year country assistance program and presented pre-membership support and a detailed
F Y 0 2 program. Subsequent annual programs were outlined in annual TSS Updates (July 2002 and
February 2004). Despite the considerable changes that took place during the TSS period, including
the February 2003 constitutional transformation from FRY to SaM, the TSS assistance program
was implemented largely as anticipated with only slight deviations in response to changing country
circumstances. W h i l e a formal review has not been undertaken, a preliminary assessment of
implementation performance and lessons learned i s laid out below.
While the FY02-04 TSS objectives were appropriate, the future program should pay greater
attention to the poverty impact o f Bank activities and to regional linkages.
Given i t s transitional nature and the urgency o f program development, the TSS relied primarily
o n outputs as indicators o f success. The future program, by contrast, should be built o n
outcome indicators, linked to the PRSP (and MDGs) and the SAP.

W h i l e the TSS program unfolded largely as planned, many additional areas requiring support
emerged during implementation. Moreover, in some instances, insufficient selectivity was
exercised and trade-offs were not sufficiently defined, evaluated, and effected. Given limited
resources, increased selectivity should be applied during both future program formulation and
implementation.
Despite well-intended plans and successes in some areas, capacity building was more limited
than envisaged, largely due to frequent changes in the responsibilities and governing structure
o f the federal and republican programs, and in ministerial and agency staffing. Against this
background, the future program should include substantial capacity building and institutional
strengthening.

The decision to maintain separate lending programs by republic, including adjustment lending,
worked well. The two union-level projects, while n o w beginning to show some improvement,
have proven particularly problematic in implementation. The CAS should continue to focus on
activities at the republican level, supplemented by select regional activities.
The high share of development policy lending under the TSS program proved an extremely
effective mechanism for assisting the Government in undertaking difficult policy reforms and
in coordinating and catalyzing donor support. In part, this reflects the fact that development
policy lending was generally accompanied by significant institutional reform. The investment
portfolio has proven less successful overall, suffering from implementation delays (many
related to the constitutional transition and the complex state union and republican legal
framework) and, from time to time, weak government support. This experience suggests that
the C A S should continue to provide substantial development policy support and that new
investment operations should, where possible, be more closely linked to the reform agenda
being pursued under the development policy operations to ensure a stronger and more
consistent focus to the Bank’s policy dialogue.
Strong donor coordination proved important in delivering results during the TSS
implementation period, but the extensive time and costs to the Bank required to support
effective donor coordination and partnerships were insufficiently recognized and planned for in
the TSS. The best results were achieved when IDA and other donors worked o n well-defined,
properly targeted, adequately resourced multi-year programs o f cooperation. Particularly
strong examples were seen in energy, social assistance, and private and financial sector
development. Active efforts to accelerate harmonization and improve donor coordination
should be part o f the C A S program. Government coordination o f donor assistance has
improved in Serbia, but will need to be strengthened in both republics over the CAS period.
Strong analytical work must continue to underpin Bank activities. The multi-year poverty
analysis program, the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR), the Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), and the Country Procurement Assessment
(CPAR) were particularly successful in enhancing and informing the adjustment lending
program during TSS implementation. These tasks proceeded in parallel with the preparation o f
development policy lending often with the same teams participating in both, allowing the
preliminary results o f AAA to feed quickly and seamlessly into policy discussions.

Within SaM’s complex political economy, flexibility i s critical to program and implementation
success. The TSS program had sufficient flexibility to allow the Bank to provide just-in-time
advice, including policy notes for the new Serbian Government.
The Bank’s Country Office was instrumental in implementing the TSS. An expanded work
program under the C A S will require strengthened expertise in procurement, financial
management, and legal services, as w e l l as additional sectoral technical expertise.

B. Proposed W o r l d Bank G r o u p P r o g r a m
66. The proposed C A S for FY05-07 reflects SaM’s track record over the past four years
and i s anchored in the SAP and the PRSP. All activities envisaged under the C A S will
contribute to meeting one or more o f the three country goals that summarize the overall economic
objectives and reforms envisaged under the SAP and the PRSP, and around which the CAS i s built:

25

P Goal 1: creating a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector;
P Goal 2: creating a larger, more dynamic private sector; and

>

G o a l 3 : reducing poverty levels, and improving social protection and access to social
services.

67. Consistent with SaM’s goals, the C A S will support far-reaching structural reforms in
the public and private sectors, while seeking to ensure that poverty i s reduced, social
protection i s adequate and appropriately targeted, and access to social services b y the poor
and vulnerable i s improved. T o ensure a self-sustaining economy and fiscally sustainable public
sector in the medium and long term, the CAS strives to help the Governments to strengthen
institutions (with institution and capacity building embedded in all planned activities) and to reduce
the weight o f the public sector in their economies. This i s a prerequisite for giving the private
sector r o o m to grow, thereby stimulating productive activity, domestic private and public savings,
and export growth. The WBG will support government efforts to increase efficiency in the public
sector (including in the delivery o f pro-poor social and economic services), while significantly
improving governance in both the private and public sectors and encouraging the development o f a

vibrant private sector. In Serbia, the Bank’s efforts will concentrate o n parallel Programmatic
Development Policy Loan (PDPL) programs, one focused on public sector reform (including public
administration and pension reform) and the other o n private sector development (including
enterprise and financial sector restructuring and privatization and energy sector reform). The
measures envisaged under the P D P L programs, and development policy support in Montenegro,
together with other assistance from the WBG and complementary assistance f r o m other
development partners, should, if implemented effectively, translate into economic growth and
employment creation. T h e anticipated major outcomes o f the CAS program are summarized in
Table 4 below.

Goal 1: Creating a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector

68. The key objectives and expected outcomes during this C A S period under Goal 1
include: (i)
fiscal consolidation; (ii)
a leaner and more efficient public administration; (iii)
better
delivery o f state services; and (iv) improved financial sustainability o f pensions, healthcare, and
education. Specific outcomes that the Bank w o u l d contribute to over the CAS period are shown in
Table 4.
69. Support from ongoing WBG projects. In Serbia, Goal 1 i s supported by two ongoing
investment projects. The Serbia Employment Promotion Project seeks to improve the efficiency
and cost-effectiveness of government-financed labor programs by piloting and testing innovative
labor redeployment programs and employment services for the unemployed. The Serbia Health
Project has two m a i n components: health services restructuring and health finance, policy and
management reform. I t i s the second o f these components that relates specifically to Goal 1 in that
it seeks to build the government capacity to develop, communicate, and implement health financing
mechanisms, health policy, and health sector regulation.

70. In Montenegro, Goal 1 i s supported by the three recently approved projects. SAC 2 i s a
multi-sectoral project that will contribute to each o f the three country goals. In terms o f Goal 1, the
main contribution o f SAC 2 i s public administration and health sector reform. The Pensions
System Administration Investment Project seeks to improve the financial position o f the pension
fund by increasing tax and contribution compliance; restructuring and modernizing the key
institutions o f the pension system; and strengthening capacity for evaluation and analysis o f the
pension system and pension reforms. The main objectives o f the Health System Improvement
Project are to improve the financial sustainability o f the healthcare system by strengthening
institutional capacity and information systems and to improve quality, efficiency, and access to
primary healthcare services.
71. New WBG projects. In Serbia, Goal 1 will be supported primarily through development
policy lending, initially through continuation o f the SAC program (SAC 2 Serbia, FY05), and then
through programmatic development policy support (PDPL 2 under the base case lending program
and PDPLs 2 and 4 under the high case). These operations will form a multi-year program o f
assistance to the Government in addressing the key institution building and reform challenges
described in Section 111. The program will likely focus o n reforms in: (i)
public finance; (ii)
public
pensions; and (iv) healthcare. The PDPL program in privatization and
administration; (iii)
restructuring o f real and financial sector assets described under Goal 2 (see paragraph 82) will also
support rationalization o f the public sector. In terms o f investment lending, under both the base
and high case lending programs, the public sector PDPL program under Goal 1 will be supported
by a Pension Administration Reform Project in FY05. L i k e the recently approved pension project
in Montenegro, this project offers an opportunity for scaling up and will target improvements in
collections and enforcement under the mandatory f i r s t pillar, provide assistance in building
capacity for policy analysis in the pensions sector, and seek administrative consolidation o f the
three pension funds.
72. In Montenegro, Goal 1 will also be supported through policy-based lending. Building on
SAC 2, DPC 1 (FY07) will likely be a multi-sectoral operation incorporating measures designed to
assist the authorities in meeting a l l three o f the country goals. With reference to Goal 1, D P C 1
28

will likely focus on deepening reforms and capacity building in the areas o f public finance and
public administration.

73. Analytical, Advisory and Other Activities. The analytical foundation for both Serbia and
Montenegro for the restructuring o f public finances envisaged under Goal 1, particularly the PDPL
program, i s provided by the 2003 PEIR, which will be updated in FY06, and the 2002 C P A R and
Country Financial Accountability Assessment. Over the CAS period, the Bank’s knowledge base
o n public financial management (PFM) will be strengthened as necessary. Building o n the C P A R
and the CFAA, a limited Fiduciary Assessment focused o n Serbia’s budgetary resource
management system i s planned in FY05 to support PDPL 1. This will be followed by an integrated
PFM report for SaM in FY06, alongside the PEIR update, that will deepen the Bank’s financial
management and procurement analysis.
74. Further analytical support will be provided by the Serbia Economic Memorandum (SEM
FY04) and the Montenegro Economic Memorandum (MEM FY05). The recently completed SEM
covers macroeconomic issues (particularly public expenditure), trade, labor market reform, private
and financial sector development, and education. The MEM will be completed in FY05 and i s
expected to focus o n macroeconomic issues (particularly public expenditure), labor market reform,
infrastructure, and the business climate. A debt sustainability analysis update for SaM i s also
planned for FY05. Additional support for improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f the public
sector in Montenegro will be provided through an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant that
aims to strengthen the capacity o f the Central Bank o f Montenegro in t e r m o f internal audit and
internal controls.
Goal 2: Creating a larger, more dynamic private sector
75. The key objectives and expected outcomes during this C A S period under Goal 2
include: (i)
continued progress on restructuring and privatization o f real and financial sector
assets; (ii)
restructuring and resolution o f large loss-making state- and socially-owned enterprises;
(iii)
improved access to finance, particularly for the S M E sector; (iv) energy sector restructuring;
and (v) where appropriate, private participation in infrastructure. Specific outcomes that the Bank
and IFC would contribute to over the C A S period are shown in Table 4.
76. Support from ongoing WBG projects. The Bank and I F C are providing substantial
ongoing support for the privatization and restructuring o f real and financial assets in Serbia. The
main pillar o f the Bank’s program i s the Privatization and Restructuring o f Banks and Enterprises
Technical Assistance Credit. This Credit supports the launching and implementation o f the
restructuring and privatization process o f some o f the most problematic, large socially-owned
enterprises and implementation o f the Government’s banking sector restructuring strategy. There
are also two other ongoing projects in this area. The Private Sector Development Technical
Assistance Grant primarily supports the Government’s tender and auction enterprise privatization
program, and also funds a legal consultancy for the drafting o f a regulation o n the conditions and
procedure for defining the liability o f the state for past environmental damage caused by
The Financial Sector Development Technical Assistance Project
enterprises under
primarily supports the Government’s bank rehabilitation and privatization program. The Serbia
Employment Promotion Project i s designed to support the privatization and restructuring process
through efficient and effective labor re-deployment and active labor market programs. In Serbia,
I F C has facilitated an agreement between a regional investment fund and the Privatization Agency
(PA) to pilot a secondary privatization scheme. This scheme could foster a wholesale approach to
T h i s will allow for clarity during the privatization process as to who will be legally responsible for environmental damage
that occurred prior to privatization. Such clarity will help attract more reputable and strategic investors.

secondary privatization, whereby a special equity fund re-privatizes a large number o f companies
with limited access to capital. In the banking sector, having reached agreement o n the restructuring
o f Udruzena Vojvodjanska Banka (WB) arrears to IFC, I F C i s supporting the restructuring and
privatization o f W B successor banks. (Additional information o n IFC’s current program i s
provided in Annex 3 .)
77. Assistance in this area i s also being provided to Montenegro by both the Bank and IFC. In
particular, the Bank, together with IFC, i s supporting financial sector reform through SAC 2,
particularly the privatization o f Podgoricka Banka and the carving out and subsequent resolution by
the Ministry o f Finance o f bad loan assets from the banking sector. The recent signing o f a
protocol with the Government o f Montenegro o n IFC’s claims on Montenegrin enterprises and
banks should pave the way for additional support for privatization and restructuring from IFC.
78. In the area o f trade and export promotion, the Bank i s providing support through two
credits, b o t h o f w h i c h cover Serbia and Montenegro. The Trade and Transport Facilitation in
Southeast Europe Project (TTFSE) i s one o f eight parallel country projects under the regional
Trade and Transport Facilitation Program, w h i c h aims to lower non-tariff costs o f trade and
transport, reduce smuggling and corruption at border crossings, and strengthen regional
partnerships and expand trade. In SaM, T T F S E supports modernization o f the Customs
Administration o f the t w o republics, establishment o f m o d e m information systems shared
across border agencies (with the ultimate objective o f establishing a single electronic w i n d o w
for traders), transparency o f information o n official requirements, and implementation o f new
customs procedures at selected border crossings. The Export Finance Facilitation Project
supports the efforts o f the Serbia and Montenegro Export Credit Agency (SMECA) to facilitate
and expand cross border trade by offering political risk insurance, w o r k i n g capital loans and
guarantees, and export performance and credit insurance.

79. The Bank also has ongoing projects in both Serbia and Montenegro that are designed to
foster sustainable private sector development through improvements in land registration and
infrastructure, notably energy, transport, and solid waste management. In the energy sector, there
are two projects in Serbia and one in Montenegro. The Serbia Energy Efficiency Project seeks to
promote energy efficiency through investments and capacity building, while the Serbia Electric
Power Emergency Reconstruction Project seeks to improve system security, financial management
o f EPS, and institutional capacity o f EPS and the Ministry o f Mining and Energy. The Montenegro
Emergency Power Reconstruction Project seeks to improve payment discipline and reduce losses.
In transport, the Serbia Transport Rehabilitation Project supports highway rehabilitation, winter
and routine maintenance, and capacity building in the Serbia Road Directorate. In solid waste
management, the Montenegro Environmentally Sensitive Tourist Areas Project (MESTAP)
supports the development o f the tourism sector by developing ecologically and commercially
sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in Montenegro coastal municipalities.
Finally, the Serbia Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project will contribute to the development
o f effective property markets by developing an efficient property registration and cadastre system.
80. I F C i s also active in Serbia in the energy sector, solid waste management, and the water and
waste water sectors. I F C i s supporting the Ministry o f Mining and Energy with three technical
assistance projects focused o n project development in the energy sector: (i)
preparation o f the
required legal framework and feasibility assessment for the Constanza-Pancevo-Omisalj (CPOT)
development o f a restructuring and privatization strategy for Naftna
o i l pipeline project;21 (ii)
Industrija Srbjie; and (iii)
development o f a cogeneration study to survey market potential and
IFC expects this pipeline to offer an environmentally safe alternative to bring high quality crude oil from Central Asia and
Russia to Southern Europe.

,

identify opportunities for private sector participation. In addition, IFC i s providing technical
assistance o n pre-privatization and restructuring measures to Elektronska Industrija and financing
an advisor to the PA. In solid waste and water and waste water, IFC has provided advice o n the
restructuring o f the Belgrade municipal solid waste management system (including the
development o f public-private partnerships and the preparation o f a tender for private participation)
and, together with EBRD and European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR), has supported the City
o f Belgrade in i t s efforts to encourage private sector participation in water and waste water
services.

8 1. MIGA’s outstanding guarantee portfolio in SaM consists o f fourteen guarantee contracts:
twelve in the financial sector, one in the services sector, and one in the manufacturing sector, with
a total gross exposure o f US$296.3 million and a net exposure o f US$151.7 million. In addition,
MIGA i s currently considering two guarantee projects totaling US$35.7 m i l l i o n that are expected
to be completed by end-2004 - one each in the financial and services sector. MIGA also provides
TA (institutional development and capacity building) o n investment promotion to both Serbia and
Montenegro. An initial project benefiting the Serbia Investment and Export Promotion Agency
(SIEPA) i s nearing completion. A comprehensive follow-on project with a two- to three-year time
horizon i s expected to be launched in early 2005; this project will be implemented by MIGA o n
behalf o f the EAR. In Montenegro, also with financial support from the EAR, MIGA i s currently
implementing an initial capacity building project in support o f the new Montenegrin Investment
Promotion Agency. MIGA’s TA activities in SaM are feeding into a new, regional FDI outreach
and marketing initiative for the Western Balkans which MIGA launched in summer 2004 (that is,
the European Investor Outreach Program for the Western Balkans). Annex 10 provides additional
information o n MIGA’s activities.

82. New WBG projects. In Serbia, support to Goal 2 will include substantial development
policy lending, initially through continuation o f the SAC program (SAC 2 Serbia) and then through
programmatic development policy support (PDPL 1 under the base case lending program and
PDPLs 1 and 3 under the high case). These operations will form a multi-year program o f
assistance to the Government in addressing the key institution building and reform challenges
resolution o f state holdings in
described in Section 111. The PDPL program will likely focus on: (i)
the banking sector; (ii)development o f the non-bank financial sector, including an appropriate
regulatory and supervisory framework; (iii)
restructuring and resolution o f large loss-making stateand socially-owned enterprises, including the railways; and (iv) further improvements in the
business environment.
83. IFC’s program complements the Bank’s program by focusing o n development o f the
financial sector, post-privatization support to selected enterprises, private sector participation in
infrastructure, and private sector investments in selected sectors (the pharmaceutical, mechanical,
and paper sectors). In the financial sector, IFC will provide assistance in development o f insurance
and leasing, bank and insurance company privatization, and the participation o f foreign strategic
investors in the sector. Also, to support the development o f housing finance in Serbia, IFC i s
considering financing a few banks, accompanied by substantial technical assistance. In the real
sector, IFC will focus on post-privatization support to export-oriented companies with a view to
enhancing their competitiveness in EU markets. In infrastructure, IFC will work closely with the
Government and the Bank to develop projects that can attract private sector financing through
public private partnerships (PPP). In Serbia, IFC will consider technical assistance to Telekom
Srbije and stands ready to discuss the possibility o f pre-privatization investment with the
Government. In addition, IFC i s establishing the Balkans Infrastructure Development Facility
(BIDFacility) in cooperation with U S A I D and European donors to help public sector entities in the
region attract private investment, particularly in energy, transport and sanitation.
31

84. The Bank’s development policy lending program in Serbia will be supported by a number o f
n e w investment operations. The B o r Regional Development Project (FY06) will support the
Government’s efforts to restructure and resolve the state’s share in the copper mining and
processing conglomerate, RTB Bor, and to encourage diversified growth and j o b creation in the
B o r region by improving the local business climate, supporting development o f small and mediumsized enterprises, developing labor redeployment and active labor market programs, and improving
environmentally damaged areas. B o r i s one o f the poorest regions o f Serbia and the restructuring
o f RTB B o r i s likely to lead to a large number o f redundancies in an already severely depressed
regional labor market (RTB i s the largest employer with a work-force o f around 8,000).
85. In addition, four Bank projects in Serbia will support the development o f a strong and
sustainable agricultural sector, which i s very important given the s t i l l relatively high share o f
agriculture in GDP and the potential o f Serbia’s food processing industry. The Rural Business
Environment Project (FY07) will seek to assist farmers in accessing EU markets by providing
advice on access to finance, EU quality standards, and modem production techniques, as w e l l as
improving applied agricultural research and dissemination. The Danube River Pollution Reduction
Project (FY05), funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), seeks to reduce nutrient
pollution by helping farmers and slaughterhouses develop and implement more environmentally
friendly production techniques. The Agro-biodiversity Conservation Project (FY06), also funded
by the GEF, will help to conserve the globally important eco-system o f the Stara Planina Nature
Park by encouraging farmers to favor locally adapted animal breeds. The Irrigation and Drainage
Rehabilitation Project (FY06) will seek to boost agricultural output through pilot irrigation
schemes, particularly in Central and Southern Serbia, clearing drainage channels to improve
drainage and reduce flooding, emergency rehabilitation o f dykes to reduce flood risks, and
institutional capacity building. IFC i s also supporting the development o f the agricultural sector
through technical assistance to Agroziv, a large private meat processing company, in i t s efforts to
modernize and meet international standards.
86. Projects in Montenegro in support o f Goal 2 will include development policy lending and a
number o f investment operations. Building o n the progress made under SAC 2, DPC 1 (FY07) will
likely seek to support private sector development through reforms in the energy sector and in the
business environment. The Tourism and Agriculture Development Project (FY06) will seek to
encourage economic growth by further developing the infrastructure base required for successful
tourism development. Two projects focused o n improving the environment, funded by the GEF,
will also help to boost tourism in the poorer northern part o f the country and around Lake Shkoder
and to ensure quality private sector growth. The Tara and Lim Basins Flood Hazard Management
Project (FY06) will seek to improve flood management and mitigation capacity, including potential
impact o f dam failure in mine tailing ponds, and to promote sustainable forest and land
management practices. The Lake Shkoder Integrated Ecosystem Management Project (FY06) will
assist the Governments o f Albania and Montenegro in implementing the Lake Shkoder Strategic
Action Plan aimed at achieving more sustainable use o f the natural resources o f Lake Shkoder and
i t s watershed. IFC will focus on institution building in the financial sector (including micro-credit
institutions), tourism, and telecommunications. With respect to the latter, I F C i s considering a preprivatization investment in Telekom Montenegro.
87. Finally, support for Goal 2 also includes two regional energy projects, one in Serbia (FY05)
and the other in Montenegro (FY06). These projects will help both republics integrate into the
regional energy market (including harmonizing market rules and technical operations) and give
consumers access to competitive suppliers from across the region (see B o x 4). This will reduce
energy costs for large industrial consumers, thereby boosting competitiveness, and compel national
utilities to be more efficient by subjecting them to competitive pressures.
32

88. Analytical, Advisory and Other Activities. In Serbia, the analytical base for activities
under Goal 2 related to restructuring and privatization o f banks and enterprises, development o f an
appropriate supervisory framework for the banking sector, and development o f a favorable business
environment i s provided primarily by the recently completed Investment Climate Assessment
(ICA) and Financial Sector Note - the findings o f which are synthesized in the SEM (see paragraph
74). Going forward, this analysis will be supplemented by a Private Sector Note, a Financial
Sector Assessment Program review (FSAP, FY05), and a Labor Market Policy Note (FY06). The
latter would support the PDPL program and could include analysis o f the constraints to j o b creation
and o f informal labor markets. Similarly, in Montenegro, the analytical base for these activities,
together with reforms in energy and infrastructure, will be provided by the forthcoming MEM,
which will synthesize the findings o f supporting studies o f energy, infrastructure, and business
environment constraints (see paragraph 74). The MEM will also include some analysis o f the labor
market.
89. The Serbia Rural Business Environment Loan will reflect the findings o f Serbia Agriculture
Report (2003) and a new piece o f analysis in FY06 looking at the constraints to the development o f
the agricultural sector and the broader challenges in rural development. In FY05, the Bank i s
carrying out a sub-regional study, including SaM, on the capacity to carry out Environmental
Impact Assessments and environmental management in general. The study will also explore
business environment aspects related to environmental management. SaM would also be part o f a
regional study o n weathedclimate forecasting agencies and strategies to adapt to climate change,
which may be responsible for increased variation in extreme climatic events, including the severe
drought that caused a significant fall in agricultural production in 2003 and severe floods in the
previous year in Serbia. The outcome o f the study m a y be identification o f a GEF co-funded
project concept that aims to introduce loss mitigation measures. Technical assistance will be
provided to the Government o f Serbia in FY05 to review the draft Water L a w from the point o f
view o f compliance with the EU Water Framework Directive.
90. As noted in Section 111, one o f the main challenges under Goal 2 i s the development o f an
effective legal and judicial system. In 2002, the Bank conducted a comprehensive legal and
judicial diagnostic. This was followed in 2003 by approval o f an IDF grant for strengthening the
court administration system in Serbia (including training and an assessment o f problems in court
administration and case management). The remaining funds under this grant are expected to be
used to assist the authorities in developing a comprehensive medium-term judicial reform strategy
and institutional strengthening o f the Ministry o f Justice in the area o f donor coordination.
9 1. IFC’s large donor-supported technical assistance program i s intended to support the
development o f a pipeline o f potential investments in SaM by helping entities in target sectors or
subsectors become bankable projects. Around US$4 m i l l i o n in donor funds has been mobilized to
support institutional development, restructuring, and project preparation, mostly from the Swedish
and Italian Governments. Looking forward, IFC will continue to provide significant technical
assistance through a variety o f instruments, ranging from broad sector analyses and capacity
building programs to highly specialized restructuring and privatization assistance. IFC’ s technical
assistance in,SaM will focus o n enhancing the development impact o f i t s investment activities,
improving the business environment for SMEs, assisting domestic companies in meeting EU
standards, facilitating the development o f domestic financial markets through institution-building
and the use o f innovative financial products, and restructuring and privatization support,
particularly in the financial sector and infrastructure.
92. IFC will also continue to provide support to SMEs through i t s well-established Southeast
European Enterprise Development (SEED) facility (see Box 7). Full integration o f SEED’S
technical assistance with IFC’s investment w o r k i s being pursued in order to further develop a joint
33

approach to project development. SEED will be working on linkage programs designed to
integrate SMEs into the supply chains o f large companies and IFC will seek to provide appropriate
financing. In agri-business, SEED i s working with business associations to support herbal and
food-processing companies, as well as working with farmers o n supply chain management to a
large vegetable o i l producer and with food processors supplying a large supermarket chain.
Box 7: SEED in Serbia and Montenegro
SEED i s a multi-donor partnership, led by IFC, in support o f SME development in the region. In 2004, SEED
was fully integrated into IFC’s regional strategy. SEED i s currently planning programs supporting SMEs and
access to fiance; (iilinkages;
)
(iii)
business membership organizations; and (iv)
private sector development in: (i)
EU standards.
The access to finance pillar addresses SME financing issues through the development and advocacy o f new
financing solutions. For example, leasing has been introduced by SEED to supplement conventional lending.
Looking forward, I F C i s planning to develop alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (ADR) by increasing the
number o f courts using mediation. In addition, a corporate governance program that targets selected enterprises i s
being prepared and, in 2005, IFC w i l l explore the possibility o f a housing program.
The linkages pillar, which i s based on SMEs that function in a supply chain, w i l l be more sharply focused o n
specific sectors. Currently, IFC i s developing a program to address the role o f Roma in supplying recycled scrap
(glass, steel, paper, and plastics) to processors in the region. With an estimated 60,000 working in recycling, this
w i l l offer Roma considerable opportunities to strengthen their business, while also strengthening the overall
environment for recycling.

The successful business membership organization pillar w i l l be extended to additional organizations, while
continuing to focus o n improving general and advocacy capacities o f new organizations and on providing training
and consultancy services to the growing number o f companies that rely o n these organizations.
In recognition o f the growing need for exporters to meet EU standards to access EU markets, a program i s being
designed to develop the requisite knowledge base at the local level and supporting organizations.

93. FIAS i s providing support on improving the business enabling environment. In particular,
F I A S has assisted the government with a self-assessment o f administrative procedures for doing
business, following up on earlier FIAS study on the general investment climate in Serbia.22 W h i l e
many o f the recommendations o f the first study were already adopted, the second study was
initiated in response to continued weak foreign direct and domestic investment. The first study
identified land acquisition and land development as the most important investment constraints,
while the second study identified three major areas o f concern. These are: (i)
start-up procedures
(with improvements needed in expatriate employment conditions, company registration, licensing,
and institutional and intellectual property rights); (ii)
locating procedures (acquisition o f land, real
estate registration, construction permits, infrastructure, leasing, and privatization practices); and
(iii) operating procedures (tax reform, improving the foreign exchange regime, customs
inspections, payment operations, and standardization). The Government subsequently prepared an
Action Plan to strengthen the Regulatory Council in i t s efforts to improve the overall regulatory
environment.

94. WBI will continue to support WBG efforts to advance private sector development in the
region, including SaM. Workshops on improving export promotion, including support to the
Serbian export promotion agency, will be carried out in FY05, complementing implementation o f
ongoing Bank projects and the CAS program. WBI will also provide training and institution
The first FIAS study undertaken in SaM, “Republic o f Serbia - The Climate for Foreign Direct Investment”, was completed
in January, 2002. The survey accompanying the second study on administrative procedures i s based on interviews with 408
firms, o f which 49 percent were small, 34 percent medium, and 17 percent large enterprises and covers the conditions,
regulatory costs, and productivity o f doing business in the country. The survey was finalized in June 2003.

strengthening as a part o f the Bank’s broader program o f support for the development o f SMEs and
enterprise restructuring and privatization, building o n GDLN video conferences o n the main
findings o f the ICA. WBI staff also recently led a small team that prepared a series o f knowledge
economy assessments for the Balkan countries and will remain engaged in subsequent program
development and implementation. Looking forward, WBI will seek to expand the regional focus o f
i t s support to measures related to Goal 2, seeking to encourage an exchange o f lessons and
knowledge in a region with significant potential for closer economic ties. The full scope o f W B I ’ s
activities planned in support o f this CAS i s provided in Annex 7.
Goal 3:

Reducing poverty levels, and improving social protection and access to public
services

95. The key objectives and expected outcomes during this CAS period under Goal 3 include
improvements in: (i)
support for rural communities; (ii)
the coverage, targeting, and reliability o f
transfers for social protection; and (iii)
the quality, access, and financial sustainability o f health and
education for a l l citizens.
96. Support from ongoing WBG projects. In Serbia, Goal 3 i s supported by two ongoing
investment projects. The Serbia Health Project has two main components: health services
restructuring and health finance, policy, and management reform. I t i s the first o f these
components that relates specifically to Goal 3. Under this component, the project supports
planning and implementation o f the Government’s strategy for improving the efficiency o f
This support includes restructuring and
healthcare delivery while maintaining quality.
rehabilitation o f physical and human capacity at four regional hospital centers, which should lead
to a visible improvement in both the availability and quality o f secondary healthcare services in
these four areas. The Serbia Education Improvement Project also has two main components:
building capacity and information to promote education reform, and improving teaching and
learning in schools, and empowering local communities to take responsibility for their schools. In
addition to helping to design and implement an information system, the project provides small
innovation grants to schools, supports the development o f capacity for measuring student
performance, and promotes decentralization.
97. In Montenegro, Goal 3 i s supported by SAC 2, which seeks to improve the reliability o f
transfers to the pension and health funds and to assist the Government in developing a mediumt e r m financing framework for both pensions and healthcare services. In addition, Goal 3 i s
supported by the recently approved Montenegro Health System Improvement Project. As
explained under Goal 1 (see paragraph 69), the main objectives o f this project are to improve the
financial sustainability o f the healthcare system by strengthening institutional capacity and
information systems and to improve quality, efficiency, and access to primary healthcare services.
98. N e w WBG projects.
In Serbia, support for Goal 3 will be provided through both
development policy lending and investment operations. In terms o f development policy lending,
the public sector reform PDPL program (see paragraph 7 1) will likely target both improvements in
social protection and reforms in health and education. Policy-based lending will be accompanied
by three projects that will have direct impact o n the objectives outlined above.
99. As noted earlier, the B o r region i s one o f the poorest areas o f Serbia and the proposed B o r
Regional Development Project (FY06) i s specifically designed to assist the authorities in
alleviating poverty by encouraging the growth o f the regional economy (see paragraph 84). In
addition to providing support to farmers to improve agricultural competitiveness (see paragraph 4850), the Rural Business Environment Project (FY07) will seek to address the challenges to
alleviating rural poverty described in Section I11 (see paragraphs 54-56), including the
35

disillusionment of the youth. In doing so, the project may seek to build o n the Government’s rural
development grant scheme by providing matching grants for selected activities designed to boost
employment and improve access to services in rural communities. The Primary Health Care
Project (FY07) will seek to address the challenges to providing quality primary healthcare outlined
in Section I11(see paragraphs 60-62).
100. In Montenegro, support for Goal 3 will also be provided through both policy-based lending
and investment operations. D P C 1 (FY07) i s expected to include a component designed to improve
the coverage and targeting o f social protection and, perhaps, a component designed to further
improve the financial sustainability o f the pensions and health systems. The Montenegro
Education Development Project (FY05) will also support the achievement o f the objectives o f Goal
3. This project seeks to improve: (i)
the efficiency o f public spending on education (thereby also
contributing to meeting Goal 1); (ii)
management o f the education sector through capacity building;
and (iii)
the quality o f education by focusing o n developing teachers’ skills.
101. Analytical, advisory and other W B G activities. In both Serbia and Montenegro, the
primary analytical base for activities under Goal 3 i s the PRSP, the 2003 PEIR, and the 2003
Poverty Assessment. Going forward, this analytical base will be updated (a PEIR update i s
planned in FY06 and a Poverty Assessment in FY07) and deepened through regular poverty
monitoring, as well as monitoring of, and reporting on, PRSP implementation. In Serbia, activities
in poverty monitoring and analysis over the CAS period include notes o n rural poverty and Roma
poverty and a social protection study. In Montenegro, regular poverty monitoring will be
supplemented by reports on the targeting and efficiency o f social programs and on health and
poverty.
102. Activities under Goal 3 in Serbia and Montenegro will also reflect the findings o f the SEM
and MEM, respectively (see paragraph 74). Studies are also under way or planned o n youth in SEE
(FY05), social capital in Serbia (FY06), and o n social protection for poor and vulnerable groups,
including Roma, IDPs, and refugees, in Montenegro (FY06/FY07). The latter will assist in the
preparation o f D P C 1. Activities under the Roma Decade o f Inclusion (see B o x 6), including the
development and implementation o f the associated action plans, will also help to assist in meeting
Goal 3.

103. To support the PRSP process, WBI has led a series o f development debates and seminars
open to all Balkan countries, including a well-attended Second PRSP Forum, enabling participants
to exchange experiences and derive lessons learned. In FY05, follow-up activities will focus o n a
Third PRSP Forum and similar related events, and a Basic Poverty Measurement and Diagnostics
course, all intended to fbrther engage participants from previous events as well as new
stakeholders. Other activities planned for FY05 will focus o n regional training o n select topics
including a course on Social Accountability and Monitoring; support o f Roma participation in
various activities; and support for the development o f websites and virtual learning environments
promoting regional networking with special emphasis on education issues and Roma women. For
both the country-specific and regional/global programs, the GDLN Network will be used as
appropriate to ensure cost efficiency and maximum knowledge sharing and dissemination. WBI
activities will also actively support partnerships particularly in the area o f private sector
development. Annex 7 elaborates upon W B I ’ s role in the delivery o f the SaM C A S program.

C. Lending Scenarios and Triggers
104. The proposed lending program envisages a gradual transition from I D A to IBRD
beginning in FY06. In recognition o f the unusual country circumstances and the success o f the
IDA program to date, SaM’s exceptional and temporary eligibility for IDA resources o n hardened

36

t e r m s has been extended to FY05-07 to allow for the establishment o f creditworthiness for limited

IBRD borrowing, thereby ensuring a smooth transition from IDA to IBRD. At the same time,
however, the amount of IDA resources allocated to SaM over the CAS period i s envisaged to be
much lower than the US$540 million three-year TSS envelope, making the establishment o f
creditworthiness for limited IBRD borrowing essential to ensure adequate lending resources to
assist SaM in meeting the three country goals on which the CAS i s built.

,

105. The IDA envelope for the CAS period i s expected to be US$225 million (subject to
policy performance - meeting the lending triggers for the base case discussed below),
supplemented by IBRD funds, if creditworthiness for limited IBRD borrowing i s established.
In addition, US$20 m i l l i o n of regional project funds under I D A 1 4 has been requested to support
Planned IDA lending i s front-loaded to allow the establishment
the two regional energy
and strengthening o f creditworthiness, with US$lOO m i l l i o n available in FY05, US$75 m i l l i o n in
FY06 and US$50 m i l l i o n in FY07. SaM’s IDA envelope for FY05 was reduced by US$18 m i l l i o n
because o f IDA’Sconstrained commitment authority (these funds were originally part o f the FY04
envelope). The E C A region i s exploring the possibility that these funds could be allocated in
FY06-07 and used to increase the size o f planned investment operations. A debt sustainability
update i s planned for end-FYO5 as an input into an assessment o f SaM’s creditworthiness for
borrowing f r o m IBRD. Ifcreditworthiness for limited IBRD borrowing i s established, the IDA
envelope o f US$225 m i l l i o n would be supplemented by US$175 m i l l i o n o f IBRD lending under
the base case and US$325 m i l l i o n under the high case, bringing the total base and high case
lending envelopes to US$400 million and US$550 million, respectively. Lending to Montenegro i s
expected to account for roughly 10 percent o f total envelope under the base and high case
scenarios. In light o f the importance o f the regional agenda (see B o x 1) and the possibility o f
generating positive externalities through a regional approach, the creation o f incentives for
participation in regional projects, in addition to the country-specific allocations, will remain an
issue with SaM’s envisaged transition ftom IDA to IBRD borrowing.

’

106. The level of lending will be closely linked to policy performance at the republican
level. Defining lending triggers for SaM as a whole i s neither possible nor appropriate, since the
responsibility for economic policy l i e s at the republican level and the policy challenges facing the
republics, while covering the same basic areas, are different. Having separate lending triggers for
each republic will allow flexibility to respond to pace o f reforms at the republican level. W h i l e
both republics are currently in the base case, in practice, this means that one o f the republics could
move to the high case program while the other remains in the base case. In addition to satisfactory
portfolio performance, the triggers for remaining in the base case for both republics target
continued macroeconomic stability and steady progress o n k e y elements o f the structural reform
agenda (see Table 6, and Section TI1 for the main challenges). The proposed base case lending
program i s strongly performance-oriented and i s centered around development policy support in
both republics targeting public sector reform and private sector development. Development policy
lending would account for around 50 percent of base case lending, in view o f the authorities’
emphasis o n significant structural reforms over the CAS period. However, as noted above, in
addition to meeting the base case triggers, access to IBRD funds under the base case will depend
o n establishment of creditworthiness for limited IBRD borrowing.

Future availability of regional project funds from IDA (implemented on a pilot basis since FY04) i s contingent on the
outcome o f the ongoing IDA 14 (FY06-08) replenishment negotiations and on a forthcoming review o f the guidelines for
regional projects. The current guidelines enable two-thirds o f the credit amount for eligible regional projects to be financed
from regional project funds, with the remaining one-third being met f r o m the country allocation.

Montenegro Tara and Lim Flood Hazards Mitigation Project (estimated USS 3-6 million).
Funding from regional project funds has been requested for these projects. Future availability of such regional funds, however, i s contingent on
the ongoing IDA 14 replenishment negotiations and on a forthcoming review of the guidelines for regional projects. In FY06, IDA regional funds
would be sought to support both the Serbia Regional Energy Project, as supplement to the country IDA allocation proposed for FY05, and the
Montenegro Regional Energy Project, in the amount of US$14 million and US$6 million, respectively.
* Depending on the Government’s priorities and projected financing requirements, some or all of these funds may be used for investment lending
in support of activities in environment and/or agriculture.

107. H i g h case lending triggers are linked to accelerated and deepened progress on
structural reforms, which will strengthen creditworthiness and lay the foundation for
sustainable growth over the medium term. The triggers indicate the areas o f the Governments’
programs that will be monitored in order t o make a judgment o n the pace and depth o f policy
reform during the CAS period (see Table 6, w h i c h also presents some indicators that will be used
in making such a judgment). In addition to the areas covered by the base case triggers, the
assessment o f policy performance under the high case will focus o n reforms in public
administration; the enterprise and financial sectors and the business environment; and the energy
sector. Consistent with a scenario o f strong progress o n structural reform, the high case lending
program, particularly in the case o f Serbia, envisages a high level o f development policy lending in
support o f the Governments’ reform efforts.

108. Both republics expect to move to the high case scenario in terms o f policy performance
as early as possible in the CAS period. However, access to IBRD funds would also depend on
the establishment o f creditworthiness for limited IBRD borrowing. Specific measures that
would indicate such strong policy performance in the near term are listed below. In Serbia, in
addition to passage by Parliament o f a budget for 2005 that envisages a high quality fiscal
adjustment (including a cut in the public sector wage bill o f around 0.4 percentage points o f GDP
and cuts in subsidies o f around 0.5 percentage points o f GDP, including the Development Fund and
the railways), policy performance consistent with the high case in the near t e r m would be
39

demonstrated by achievement o f at least 3 o f the following: (i)
enactment o f core public
administration legislation, including the L a w on State Administration and the L a w on Salaries; (ii)
completion o f the ongoing sales o f 3 state banks and launching the tender for privatization o f
another large bank in which the state has a majority share (which in total account for more than 20
percent o f the assets o f the banking system); (iii)
completion in FY05 o f 10 tender privatizations
and resolution of a fbrther 5 companies, or parts thereof, through restructuring (these 5 companies
are expected to account for around 10 percent o f the total workforce in companies on the
Government’s restructuring list); and (iv) legal unbundling o f EPS (creation o f separate generation
and distribution subsidiaries and a separate transmission company). Similarly, in Montenegro, in
addition to passage by Parliament o f a satisfactory budget for 2005 specific measures that would
contribute to a favorable assessment o f progress o n reform are: (i)
implementation o f the new L a w
conclusion o f an acceptable power purchase agreement
o n Salaries in the 2005 budget; and (ii)
between Kombinat Aluminijuma Podgorica (KAP) and EPCG.
109. I n the event that the base case triggers are not met, lending will shift to a low case.
Bank lending under the l o w case would be around US$50 m i l l i o n per annum - less than h a l f the
amount envisaged under the base case - and would be focused o n capacity building, social sector
service delivery, and regional projects. These projects would seek to alleviate the impact o f the
changing country circumstances o n poor and vulnerable populations, while also seeking to capture
externalities from regional projects.

D. Implementing the C A S
Partnerships and Donor Coordination

110. The Bank works closely with multilateral and bilateral donors providing support for
the overall reform program, particularly through the Country Office. The European Commission
(EC) i s the Bank’s key partner, promoting reforms linked with the SAP and sharing the mandate
with the Bank to facilitate coordination o f donor assistance to SaM.24 The Bank and the E C are
working j o i n t l y with the SaM authorities, and other donors, particularly DFID, towards
harmonization, including procurement and financial management policies. Aiming at closer
economic, political, and social ties amongst SEE member countries, the Stability Pact and i t s
various Working Groups provide a useful platform for dialogue and cooperation with donors (see
B o x 1). The Bank also works closely with the EBRD and EIB to foster private sector development,
and with U N D P and bilateral donors, including DFID, in assisting the Governments’ in PRSP
implementation and monitoring, as well as o n integration o f the MDGs and the PRSP. During the
C A S period, the Bank will also continue to work with the IMF to address the underlying structural
causes o f macroeconomic imbalances. As described in Sections I11 and I V o f the CAS, World
Bank activities under Goals 1 and 2 in particular will support the Government’s efforts to reduce
non-interest current expenditures in a sustainable manner and to increase competitiveness. Given
the close link between successful implementation o f reforms designed to meet these goals and
fiscal and external sustainability, continued close collaboration between the Bank and the IMF i s
essential. Donor involvement by sub-sector in SaM i s highlighted in Annex 9.
111. As part o f their harmonization efforts, both Serbia and Montenegro intend to
strengthen donor coordination capacity. In tandem, the international community (IC) needs to
work towards greater complementarity and selectivity within and among programs - a significant
challenge given the continued shift in assistance from post-conflict reconstruction to deepened
support for growth and equitable development, and the projected decline in the volume ‘ o f donor
24

Between 2000 and 2003, the Bank and the EC together coordinated 3 donor conferences, raising some USS4.1 billion in
pledged donor assistance on behalf o f SaM’s economic reform program.

40

assistance. A good example o f this collective effort by the I C to intensify donor coordination i s the
multi-donor (GTZ, WB, USAID, EBRD, EAR, SIDA, Switzerland, and WTO) working group that
supports the development o f the financial sector. The Serbian Ministry o f International and
Economic Relations i s progressively assuming more responsibility and accountability for
coordinating and reporting donor assistance, but faces substantial capacity constraints.
Overcoming capacity constraints also represents a major hurdle in Montenegro, and donors,
including the Bank, are working to achieve improved complementarity in terms o f both
programming and implementing assistance in order to reduce the burden o f coordination on the
authorities and to maximize program outcomes. In both republics, the PRSP process has
significantly enhanced opportunities for new and ongoing consultation and partnership with c i v i l
society and the donor community.
Portfolio Management

112. The SaM portfolio has grown rapidly since 2000. A total o f 29 operations have been
approved over the last four years. Total commitments to date amount to US$603.6 m i l l i o n
(including US$30 million in grants from IBRD net income and a further US$33.6 m i l l i o n in trust
funds and cofinancing) o f which US$401 million has been disbursed. The current SaM portfolio
consists o f 20 projects with an undisbursed balance o f US$223 million. Given the relatively large
portfolio compared to the level o f commitments envisaged over the CAS period, effective portfolio
implementation will be key to achieving the three country goals around which the CAS program i s
built (see Results Framework in Annex 8).
113. Continued efforts will be required to strengthen portfolio implementation. There are
currently two problem projects (Serbia Education Improvement Project and Serbia Health Project).
Detailed action plans for improving performance have been developed for both o f these projects
and the results to date are encouraging. There are currently no projects at risk. Continued close
portfolio monitoring will be necessary to maintain, and improve, SaM’s implementation track
record - in this respect, it i s important to remember that the SaM portfolio i s very young, with an
average age o f just 1.5 years. W h i l e the FY04 JPR highlighted a number o f cross-cutting project
issues, particularly in Serbia (which accounts for 13 o f the 18 projects currently under
implementation), most o f the delay in project implementation experienced to date are projectspecific and relate primarily to political changes and associated policy uncertainties. In t e r m s o f
cross-cutting issues, the key issue raised in both republics was the need for a focal point within the
Ministry o f Finance empowered to oversee the Bank’s portfolio on behalf o f the Ministry and to act
as a liaison for Project Implementation Units (PIUs). B o t h republics have n o w appointed focal
points and all PIUs have been informed accordingly. In view o f the need to build capacity in
procurement and financial management, a Technical Services Unit was recently established in
Montenegro under the Deputy Prime Minister to handle these aspects o f project implementation for
Bank projects. Responsibility for all other aspects o f project implementation remains with the
Ministryhes concerned. This separation o f responsibilities should enable effective implementation
o f the Montenegro portfolio. The decentralization o f responsibility for portfolio management to
the Country Office should also help to support implementation in both republics.

41

V. Creditworthiness and Risk
A. Creditworthiness and D e b t Sustainability
114. SaM’s external debt to GDP ratio has declined from over 103 percent in 2001 to a
projected 57.8 percent in 2004 (see Table 7). This improvement reflects the normalization o f
relations with Paris and London Club creditors, as well as an increase in dollar GDP. In November
2001, SaM secured a highly concessional debt restructuring agreement with the Paris Club. This
agreement involved, among other things, a phased 66 percent reduction in the net present value o f
Paris Club obligations and a rescheduling o f the remaining stock over 22 years with a 6-year grace
period. In July 2004, SaM also reached an agreement with the London Club o f commercial
creditors settling Serbia’s outstanding US$2.7 billion debt. The agreement implies roughly a 62
percent net present value write-off, and reschedules the rest over 20 years at an interest rate o f 3.75
percent during the first 5 years and 6.75 percent during the remaining 15 years.

115. External debt to GDP i s projected to decline further over the CAS period, but the
outlook for liquidity indicators i s less favorable. External debt to GDP i s projected to decline to
52.6 percent by 2007, suggesting that the base case macroeconomic framework satisfies the longrun sustainability condition. However, the picture in terms o f liquidity indicators i s less favorable,
reflecting a combination o f expiration o f grace periods on new and restructured debts and rising
short-term borrowing (see Table 7). For instance, the ratio o f TDS to exports i s projected to
fluctuate between roughly 11 and 15 percent between 2004 and 2007, w e l l above i t s 2002 and 2003
levels o f 3.4 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively. All other things being equal, this less favorable
outlook renders the country more vulnerable to adverse external shocks, including slower than
expected export growth due to weak foreign demand for SaM’s products and services and faster
real exchange rate depreciation.
116. While IBRD’s current and projected exposure to S a M i s high, S a M has established a
strong record o f servicing Bank debt since 2001 and exposure indicators are projected to
improve over the CAS period. IBRD exposure i s high measured o n a per capita basis or as a
share o f GDP or exports, and IBRD debt accounts for a large share o f SaM’s total debt
outstanding.” Debt service ratios are more favorable, however. IBRD debt service to exports o f
goods and services i s projected to increase moderately over the CAS period but remains l o w at less
than 2 percent. Bank debt service as a share o f total public debt service i s projected to decline from
i t s current level o f 23.4 percent in 2004 to 23 percent in 2007. The share o f IBRD debt in SaM’s
total debt outstanding i s projected to remain at around 19 percent during the period o f
consideration. SaM i s not currently considered creditworthy for IBRD lending, and all IBRD loans
to SaM are in non-accrual status.

B. Risks
117. Both republics continue to face tremendous political, policy, and implementation
capacity pressures that could lead to slippage on the reform agenda, thereby complicating the
medium-term macroeconomic and growth outlook. The establishment o f the state union,
together with the heightened partisan debate that followed the assassination o f Serbian Prime
Minister Djindjic, led to temporary delays in legislative and economic reforms, and slippages in
day-to-day economic management. Since early 2004, however, the Government o f Serbia has
demonstrated remarkably strong policy performance, responding by deepening and accelerating the
economic reforms, thereby mitigating - at least temporarily - the r i s k s to reform program
implementation.
118. Nonetheless, the political will to implement difficult reforms in both republics remains
highly vulnerable to shifting relations within the respective ruling coalitions (both faced with
approving new republican constitutions in the near future), as w e l l as to relations between the two
republics. This political commitment will be tested over the C A S period in both republics by the
need to enact measures that result in durable cuts in non-interest current expenditures, while
increasing public investment. Compounding the impact o f SaM’s complex political economy o n
the pace o f reforms are considerable capacity constraints o n implementation o f economic
legislation and regulations. Against this background, guarding against “reform fatigue,” while
maintaining strong progress o n reforms necessary to underpin fiscal sustainability and sustainable
medium-term export-led growth, will be essential to maintain the momentum o n the reform agenda.
Other factors that could complicate the reform process over the C A S period include a potential
referendum on the continuation o f the state union, developments in Kosovo and southern Serbia,
The noted high share o f IBRD debt in the total was inherited from SFRY. At the end o f 2000, the share o f IBRD debt in the
country’s total debt was 15.6 percent. As a result o f the dollarieuro exchange rate developments, debt to IBRD increased both
in terms o f i t s share in the total debt (to 18.2 percent at the end o f 2003) and in U S $ terms-from U S $ 1.8 billion at the end o f
2000 to USS 2.6 billion at the end o f 2003.

failure to satisfy some key partners o n the depth and pace o f cooperation with ICTY, vested
interests at a l l levels o f government (including local and municipal governments), and additional
complexities arising from new, constitutionally-mandated, state-level structures.

119. SaM’s ability to maintain a sustainable macroeconomic framework, achieve a recovery
of growth, and deepen economic competitiveness could be adversely affected by exogenous
shocks. The projected resurgence in exports, which i s important for debt sustainability (liquidity
ratios) as well as the broader economic growth agenda, m a y not materialize in the event o f weaker
than anticipated foreign demand associated with potential slowdown in economic activity amongst
key trading partners. Similarly, SaM’s medium-term financing picture relies o n a marked rebound
in foreign direct investments that m a y not materialize in the event o f unfavorable development in
global and/or EU markets. Economic growth could also be affected by poor agricultural output
(agriculture accounts for around 25 percent o f GDP) in the event o f adverse weather.

VI. Concluding Remarks
120. SaM’s impressive track record of solid policy performance in the wake of important
political events bodes well for the outcome o f the overall reform program during the CAS
period and building the level of confidence essential to fostering growth and investment.
Based o n this experience, despite formidable challenges ahead, slippage o n major components o f
the reform agenda i s considered unlikely. Ongoing engagement o f the international community,
especially in the form o f an increasingly robust portfolio o f long-term lending, will help to ensure
continued progress. At the same time, the risks associated with continuation o f the state union will
be mitigated by focusing the WBG’s assistance at the republican level.

Annex 1

Relations with the European Union and Progress on the
Stabilization and Association Process
Relations between the EU and the countries o f the Western Balkans, including SaM, have been
developing since 1999 within the broader context o f the SAP. The SAP calls for far-reaching
political and economic obligations by prospective member countries in exchange for assistance in
achieving closer integration with the European Union. The SAP framework includes a potential
contractual relationship, or Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA), and an assistance
program (CARDS) to help participating countries to progress, at their o w n pace, towards EU
membership.26 The EU’s goal o f full integration o f the Balkans was reaffirmed at the Feira
Council in M a y 2000, and again in Zagreb in November 2000, when the countries o f the region
committed themselves to SAP conditions and objective^.^' Here, the EU offered the prospect o f
full accession based on the Treaty o f the European Union (Maastricht Treaty) and the Copenhagen
criteria.28

The EU’s efforts to continue the SAP with full speed were reaffirmed at the Thessaloniki Council
in 2003, when i t introduced the so-called Thessaloniki Agenda. Through this agenda, SAP was
expanded to include the creation o f two new instruments: European Partnerships and a set o f tools
based on the EU’s enlargement methodology. The European Partnership identifies specific
priorities and obligations to be fulfilled by each country in the short and medium term. These
obligations, grouped into four categories which follow the format o f the Copenhagen criteria,
predicate the EC’s financial assistance through the CARDS program. For SaM, an Enhanced
Permanent Dialogue (EPD) was established in July 2003 to build o n the work o f previous
Consultative Task Force meetings in providing a framework for technical and policy dialogue.
The recommendations ensuing from the EPD serve as guidelines and benchmarks for relevant
reform measure^.'^ Furthermore, the Thessaloniki agenda stipulates: political cooperation in the
area o f Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP); enhanced support for institution building;
promoting economic development; and opening the EU community programs to the Western
Balkans countries.
In recent years, relations between SaM and the EU have followed a generally positive trend. The
EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, witnessed the
signing o f the “Belgrade Agreement” in March, 2002. Immediately following the assassination o f
Serbian Prime Minister Djindjic, Javier Solana and Chris Patten, the EU external affairs
commissioner, flew to Belgrade not only to express their condolences, but also to show their
support for the tremendous efforts that SaM has put into securing their stability.

The progress of SaM in the SAP has been charted annually through three consecutive
Stabilization and Association Reports for 2002,2003 and 2004. The f i r s t annual report from 2002
SAA are very similar to the Europe Agreements, which the European Union introduced for the countries o f Central Eastem
Europe (CEE) in the beginning of 1990s.
27 FR Yugoslavia Country Strategy paper 2002-2006, The European Commission.
28 T h e European Council in Copenhagen 1993 spelled out the Copenhagen criteria, by which candidate counties would be
judged for accession: 1) stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the r u l e o f law, human rights and respect for and
protection o f minorities; 2) existence of a functioning market economy, as well as capacity to cope with competitive pressure
and market forces within the EU; and 3) ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of
olitical, economic and monetary union - i.e. acquis communautaire. .

Annex 1
dealt with issues prior to the adoption o f the SaM Constitutional Charter, notably the fragility of,
and lack o f clearly defined roles for, the State institutions. The second report, produced shortly
after the adoption o f the Constitutional Charter in February, 2003, accentuated the need for further
implementation o f the Constitutional Charter and capacity building on the State level. According
to the report, only with full commitment and co-operation within the state, and decisive action to
pick up the pace of reform, would the state be able to make the necessary progre~s.~’This
emphasis o n the functioning o f the state union remained as the central issue o f the third EU annual
report, where progress has been classified as mixed at best. I t noted that, although the
Constitutional Charter had been adopted, which according to the EC i s an achievement in i t s o w n
right, the implementation o f reforms has been slow and incomplete. The E C also noted with
alarm that the lack o f consensus o n the union level was weakening joint institutions and policies,
which are sine qua non for progress on political and economic reforms and for developing
relations between SaM and the EU.3’ This slow process o n implementing the necessary reforms
has, to date, prevented SaM from establishing a contractual relationship with the European Union.
Nonetheless, as a result o f the adoption o f the Constitutional Charter and the Internal Market and
Trade Action Plan in early 2003, the European Union commenced work on a Feasibility Study, a
necessary prelude to the possibility to open negotiations on a SAA. The Feasibility report for
SaM considers of a number o f criteria: the degree o f compliance with SAP political and economic
conditions, the overall functioning o f the State Union, the existence o f a single trade policy and a
single market, progress o n sectoral reforms and on those institutions at the state level necessary to
implement the possible SAA.32 Subsequently, however, attempts to complete the Feasibility
Study were delayed due to the lack o f agreement within the country o n h o w to proceed towards an
Agreement and because o f the I C T Y issue. I t was not until October 2004, following a visit by
Messrs. Patten and Solana to Belgrade that the EC decided to re-start i t s work o n the Feasibility
Study, as a result of political decision-makers in SaM agreeing to the so-called “twin track
approach”. Under this approach, the EU would deal with the republics on policies that each
conducts separately, including trade, economic and sectoral policies. Simultaneously, it would
continue to w o r k with the Union o f SaM where it i s the competent authority, including, for
example, o n matters of international obligation and human rights, with a view to an eventual
single S A A with SaM. It i s currently anticipated that the Feasibility Study could be completed by
spring 2005.
The 2004 European Partnership for SaM, identified the most pressing near-term priorities with
further work o n the Feasibility Study dependent upon fulfillment o f these priorities. In the area o f
democracy and the rule of law, SaM was advised to continue implementing the Constitutional
Charter, to establish the State Court as well as to adopt the State Parliamentary r u l e s o f procedure.
Significant weight i s given to the adoption o f defense strategy and military doctrine. Emphasis
was also placed o n Serbia completing the ongoing electoral l a w reform, adopting a comprehensive
strategy on public administration reform, and continuing the preparations for the implementation
o f the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, as Serbia i s unequivocally lagging behind
Montenegro in these areas. Montenegro was advised to continue implementing the strategy o n
public administration reform. Finally, both republics were advised to prepare a comprehensive
anti-corruption strategy and adopt law on conflict o f interests.

In the area o f human rights and protection o f minorities, the EU encourages establishing a Human
Rights Ombudsman Office in Serbia, while strengthening the administrative capacities o f
Ombudsman office in Montenegro. B o t h republics are urged to adopt legislation o n property
restitution. The most important obligation in terms o f regional and international cooperation
relates to full cooperation o f the State with the International Criminal Tribunal for former
Yugoslavia.
In the area o f market economy and structural reform, SaM i s encouraged to sustain i t s
macroeconomic stability. This would entail continuing a prudent monetary policy stance, backed
up by appropriate exchange rate policy, and establishing more efficient monetary instruments with
a view to improving the targeting o f monetary aggregates. Furthermore, S a M i s advised to
accelerate the restructuring and privatization, as w e l l as liquidation o f large, socially and stateowned enterprises, while fully liberalizing prices and removing administrative controls.

B o t h entities are strongly advised to accelerate further alignment o f the national legislature with
the acquis c ~ m m u n a u t a i r eespecially
~~
in the field o f trade (domestic and foreign), customs
administration, public procurement, anti-trust measures and the protection o f intellectual property
rights. Attention i s also focused o n cooperation in the field o f justice and home affairs, especially
in the areas o f border management, combating organized crime, human trafficking, i l l i c i t drugs
trafficking, money laundering and terrorism.

Medium term priorities also address issues o f capacity building o f the State and local governments
including: strengthening the European integration offices within the government, adopting the
c i v i l service and public administration laws and strengthening the economic policymaking process
and promoting local governments, i.e. accelerating decentralization. Moreover, SaM i s
recommended t o continue the sustainable macroeconomic policies, but also to introduce new
reform measures, including the reduction o f state subsidies, transfers and public service wage bill.

Annex 2
South Eastern Europe Regional Studies and Initiatives
In the past few years, greater attention has been paid to ensuring an integrated regional approach
to common challenges. Within the Bank, the Regional Framework Paper for South Eastern
Europe provides the structure for the formulation o f individual country assistance strategies to
ensure that programs are designed to have optimal impact at both the country and regional level.
The Framework identifies areas o f activity with cross-border externalities, economies o f scale, or
opportunities for “scaling up” successful interventions across borders. It also identifies
opportunities to encourage regional cooperation within the ambit o f Bank activities, and a
common reference for supporting SEE countries on the path toward integration in European
structures. Within this conceptual umbrella, the Bank i s engaged in a variety o f regional
programs, initiatives and studies including the following.

A Framework for the Development of the Regional Transport System in the Balkans was
commissioned to synthesize the contents, conclusions, and recommendations o f a series o f
sector reports in the road, railway and inland water transport sectors, together with other
related initiatives focusing o n trade and transport facilitation and road safety. The main
objective i s to identify and describe, in actionable terms, measures o f regional importance
are considered necessary to promote the efficiency and effectiveness o f the transport
that: (i)
sector; and (ii)would promote trade in goods and transport services among the Balkan
countries and between these countries and the EU. The Framework i s scheduled for
completion in FY05.

The Trade and Transport Facilitation Program for South Eastern Europe aims to reduce
non-tariff costs to trade and transport, reduce smuggling and corruption at border crossings,
and strengthen customs and border control agencies in the region. It includes all eight
countries o f South Eastern Europe (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, FYR
FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Romania and Serbia and Montenegro) with a focus o n Customs
and road transport. Details about the program, including performance measurement, can be
found at www.seerecon.org/ttfse. At the request o f South East European countries, the Bank

P Regional Study on Public Expenditure Policies in South Eastern Europe. Public
expenditure policies have in general lagged behind the reform needs in SEE. Public
expenditures as a share o f GDP have remained relatively high in the past decade, though there
i s significant variance across countries. The main objective o f the study, underway, i s 1 to
distill the lessons learned that emerge from select SEE countries' efforts to reform their
expenditure policies, in order that they m a y be applied to increasing the effectiveness o f
interventions across the region. In particular, the study will highlight the successhl efforts to
consolidate public expenditures and reduce public expenditures as a share o f GDP. The study
also aims to generate debate and explore the scope for a region-wide approach to select public
expenditure issues.

diseases.

P The Social Development Initiative for South Eastern Europe aims at promoting the design
of policies and programs that: (i)
support social cohesion through improved integration o f
ethnic minorities and youth as agents o f social change and development: and (ii)
reduce social

IFC Strategy and Activities
Introduction
SaM i s a major I F C priority in South East Europe. During FY02-03 IFC committed about US$43
m i l l i o n in 5 projects, three in financial markets and two in manufacturing. Donor-supported
technical assistance has been an important component o f the I F C strategy to develop a pipeline o f
potential investments in SaM. During the last two years I F C has mobilized about US$4 m i l l i o n o f
trust fund resources for TA that have been used to conduct more than twenty assignments. I F C has
developed a strong TA program o n institutional strengthening in the insurance sector, leasing, and
banking. Also, in order to position i t s e l f in strategic sectors and generate more investment
opportunities, IFC has supported, through i t s TA program, project preparation in the energy sector,
electronics, information technology, and hotels. I t s results will materialize in the kture depending
o n the pace o f policy reforms and liberalization in sectors s t i l l controlled by the Governments such
as insurance, telecommunications, and energy, a l l o f which are good candidates for pre-privatization
investments.
Though foreign investors’ country risk appetite remains modest, opportunities for new IFC
investment projects are being actively pursued in both the financial and manufacturing sectors.
IFC’s program development, however, depends o n h r t h e r implementation o f the Governments
reform agenda, the creation o f a favorable business climate, and the acceleration o f the
privatization process. W h i l e in the short term I F C will continue to expand i t s activities in general
manufacturing and the financial sectors, in the longer term I F C will l o o k for opportunities t o
support SaM with investments in the energy and telecommunication sectors, as w e l l as in the
infrastructure sector.

Financial Sector
Overall the financial sector in S a M has made impressive progress over the past three years. The
government’s reform agenda to date has been concentrated o n stabilization and urgent f i r s t stage
restructuring in the banking sector and parallel but also incomplete reforms in the regulatory and
institutional framework for financial sector operations. The country’s financial sector remains
severely underdeveloped and the existing level o f financial intermediation i s s t i l l unable to
contribute h l l y to the economic growth agenda. The current government’s stated commitment to
accelerating the reform o f financial sector gives hope that SaM could see rapid financial redeepening rather than an extended period o f financial sector stagnation that has haunted some
economies in the region.
Today’s status quo i s one in which many banks, primarily those in state ownership, are seriously
fettered by their backlogs o f non-performing loans to large socially-owned enterprises. At the
same time, most private and foreign banks find the alternative o f servicing the emerging private
SME sector unattractive in the present, imperfect legal and institutional environment. The
banking system i s overpopulated and segmented, dominated by local banks with their historic
problems, and characterized by an unsustainably high level o f state ownership. A handful o f
larger majority state-owned banks have relatively good effectiveness ratings, despite their
problems with historic loans. Their revival through speedy privatization to strategic investors
would help to introduce more viable competition at the top end o f a market that today appears to
be supply constrained.
51

Annex 3

The currently limited access to finance and the high cost o f banking services present a major
challenge as w e l l as an opportunity for non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) in expanding their
clientele base and serving the needs o f the economy. As in many other transition economies, the
NBFIs sector (capital markets, leasing, mortgage providers, pension funds) in SaM i s lagging
behind the developments in the banking sector both in terms o f i t s size and market share o f all
financial services, as well as in terms o f quality o f services and i t s public recognition. The sector
faces a number o f legal, regulatory, and institutional constraints. The experiences o f other
transition countries show that poorly regulated NBFIs can easily become breeding grounds for
serious financial malpractice and even systemic crises. Hence, although the NBFIs are currently
small relative t o the banking sector, a sound framework for their expansion needs to be put in
place as soon as possible to ensure their sound development in the future.
Strengthening financial intermediation through both investments and advisory services i s critical
to IFC’s strategy to enhance local investments and reach a large number o f businesses. IFC has
contributed to strong foreign strategic investor interest in the financial sector and to establishing
viable financial institutions. Through i t s equity investments, IFC supported the first Microfinance
Bank and the establishment of RaiffeisenBank in the country. In Montenegro, I F C approved an
investment in Opportunity Bank Montenegro for a line o f credit o f up to Euro4 m i l l i o n to fund
micro-enterprise and SME lending.
I F C has been working to support the Government o f Serbia with restructuring and the
privatization o f the banking sector. IFC i s supporting the restructuring and privatization o f UVB
successor banks. The Government o f Serbia and IFC have already agreed on restructuring o f
UVB arrears to IFC. This agreement will facilitate the initial stage o f the bank privatization
process in Serbia, including the privatization o f Vojvodjanska Banka. Also, the recent agreement
between IFC and the Government o f Montenegro o n the restructuring o f IFC’s claims o n
Montenegrin enterprises and banks, should pave the way for additional I F C restructuring and
privatization support. This includes IFC’s support for Podgoricka Banka, one o f the largest banks
in Montenegro, through restructuring o f i t s arrears, pre-privatization investments, and a broadranging technical assistance program.
Despite strong demand, the development o f non-bank financial intermediaries i s s t i l l modest in
SaM, mainly because of the weak system for registration o f collateral security and court
enforcement procedures. I F C i s looking for opportunities to develop and support housing,
leasing, and securities market development, through both investment and TA. T o support the
development o f housing finance, I F C i s considering financing to a few banks in Serbia
complemented by the provision o f substantial TA. IFC’s SEED has provided extensive assistance
to the institutional development o f leasing and i s preparing a leasing market survey to feed into
the preparation o f a multi-country leasing facility aimed at a more extensive outreach to eligible
leasing operators.

The ability to issue equity in the primary market i s not yet an option for companies, until further
reforms are implemented to strengthen the institutions needed to create a liquid secondary market.
Very few companies are listed in the Belgrade stock exchange and banks cannot be listed. The
P A in Serbia has contributed to the development o f the stock market through the launching o f
auction privatizations with the mandatory listing in the stock exchange. The P A i s planning to
launch the first initial public offerings o n a few private companies with stronger business
fundamentals, by placing the shares of the State Share Fund and State Pension Fund. I F C would
consider supporting the P A to prepare the f i r s t IPOs.

52

Annex 3
T o target investment opportunities in the privatization process in South Eastern Europe, including
in SaM, IFC has invested US$40 m i l l i o n in two regional equity funds, Bancroft and Poteza. In
addition, IFC has facilitated an agreement between Bancroft and the P A to p i l o t test a new
privatization scheme. Bancroft i s screening potential companies in the Share Fund portfolio to
select a first candidate to buy enough stock to reach a majority equity package, combined with
large minority stakes held in the State Share Fund’s portfolio, and then jointly sell i t to qualified
buyers. If the pilot case i s successful, it may facilitate a wholesale approach by setting up a
special equity fund to re-privatize a large number o f selected companies with limited access to
capital because of their unclear corporate governance.

IFC has already provided extensive due diligence to the Serbian Insurance Supervisor on drafting
a new l a w and recommending actions to improve regulation and the supervisory function
capacity. Also, IFC has conducted a preliminary due diligence on the restructuring and
privatization o f Dunav Insurance Company. I t s findings and recommendation, together with a
pre-privatization investment proposal, have been submitted to the Government.
Corporate Sector
Despite major progress to date, enterprise sector reform s t i l l has a long way to go. Serbia’s
private sector share o f GDP was only 52 percent in 2002 compared to 74 percent in Bulgaria.
IFC’s investment opportunities in the corporate sector are limited by state ownership in large
companies, weak corporate governance, employee and management shareholding in larger
manufacturing companies, lack o f financial discipline, and weak accounting standards in most o f
local businesses. Also, private ownership i s concentrated and channeled through less than
transparent offshore holding vehicles, and potential exposure to reputation risk with some local
individual sponsors i s relatively high. FDI has yet to play an important role in investment. FDI
per capita in Serbia in 1989-2002 was $200, compared to $1,400 in Croatia, $560 in Bulgaria, and
$460 in FYR Macedonia.

Within these constraints, I F C has been working to develop investment opportunities in retaildistribution, tourism, agribusiness, electronic industry, paper, and pharmaceuticals. IFC has
achieved good results investing Euro 20 m i l l i o n in Tigar Michelin Holding, a leading regional
producer o f high quality car tires. The financing was accompanied by extensive TA to the
company and i t s suppliers, supported by IFC trust funds and SEED linkages program, resulting in
high development impact. IFC intends to replicate this successful model in other manufacturing
companies. Moreover, IFC pays particular attention to potential regional investment opportunities
with the capacity to enhance regional economic integration.
IFC i s providing an innovative TA program to Elektronska Industrija, a Serbian manufacturer o f
consumer electronic products and home appliances, to help the company with pre-privatization
restructuring and to facilitate the joint ventures and/or direct sales to foreign investors. With
targeted TA, I F C has also supported private initiatives in food and consumer goods, textile
apparel industry, rubber industry, paper, light mechanical industry, and packaging industry. The
early TA projects had identified a few potential IFC investment candidates, most o f them,
however, ultimately did not qualify under IFC credit quality criteria or reach the minimum
investment threshold. Nonetheless, the relevant preparatory work has been useful to the
beneficiary company to find locally alternative sources o f commercial financing.

53

Annex 3
Infrastructure

The quality o f key infrastructure services in SaM i s poor and the sector requires fundamental
reform and restructuring, as well as investments to meet the directives on infrastructure o f the
European Union, associated with the SAP35(see Annex 1). The infrastructure sector would play a
critical role for sustained economic growth and international competitiveness, and IFC foresees
potentially significant opportunities for expanding i t s products and services in the sector. For
these reasons, the IFC strategy in SaM will complement the Bank’s program o f support for
establishing the proper regulatory and institutional foundation in the infrastructure sector. In
tandem with the Bank’s program o f support, I F C will be committed to supporting the
restructuring and preparation for privatization o f the sector, as w e l l as facilitating private sector
participation in sector related management, financing, and ownership.
Through i t s Balkans Infrastructure Development Facility (BIDFacility), I F C will help public
sector entities in the South East Europe region, including SaM, to attract private sector
participation and investments in infrastructure, primarily in the energy, transport and water and
sanitation sectors (Box 1). I F C focus will be to explore, facilitate, and support public-private
partnership (PPP) opportunities, particularly in solid waste and water management services (city
o f Belgrade), o i l and gas transport and distribution (Constanza-Pancevo-Omisalj-Trieste pipeline
and pre-privatization o f Naftna Industrija Srbije), and the power cogeneration sector.

-

Annex 3 Box 1: Balkan Infrastructure Development Facility
A poor and unreliable infrastructure continues to discourage private investors and hinder economic growth in the
Balkan region. In turn, slower economic growth reduces the availability o f government funds to improve
infrastructure. To break this cycle, I F C i s establishing the Balkans Infrastructure Development Facility in
cooperation with U S A I D and European donors. The facility will help public sector entities in the Southern
Europe region (including SaM) to attract private sector investments in infrastructure, focusing o n the energy,
transportation, and water and sanitation sectors. The facility reflects the World Bank Group strategy to broaden
engagement in t h i s sector to ensure efficient, affordable, and sustainable delivery o f infrastructure services. The
facility w i l l help identify, develop, structure, and reach financial closure o n infrastructure projects, so that
committed public sector entities can engage more effectively with the private sector and attract investments
critical to the region’s economic development. I F C w i l l launch the Facility in FY05.

Since March 2002, I F C has been working o n the restructuring o f the Belgrade municipal solid
waste system, to prepare the tender for the concession to the private sector o f the solid waste
management services and to introduce a public-private partnership (PPP). This i s expected to be
the first major municipal infrastructure privatization in SaM. In 2003, IFC signed a mandate to
advise the City o f Belgrade in the development and implementation o f a PPP for i t s water sector
concession in cooperation with the EAR and EBRD.
In the area o f information and communication technology, IFC will explore investment
opportunities in the sector. I F C i s willing to help the Governments o f Serbia and Montenegro
with the privatization o f Telecom Srbija and Montenegro Telecom, respectively. IFC i s n o w
considering a pre-privatization investment opportunity in Telekom Montenegro. IFC intends to
provide TA to Telekom Serbia and to help the company to prepare a strategy for hrther sector
liberalization. I F C i s open to discuss with the government a potential pre-privatization
investment. A TA project has also been completed to identify potential opportunities for
Some 29 percent o f sampled water supplies in Serbia do not meet bacteriological standards; 56 percent o f
Serbian roads are classed as in “very bad conditions”; and there i s a 20 percent forced outage rate in electrical

investing in the Internet sector development in Serbia. The findings o f the study have been
disseminated by IFC during a seminar targeted to potential investors.
In the energy sector, I F C has been active supporting an advisory assignment to prepare a
restructuring and privatization strategy o f the Serbian o i l company Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS),
as well as launching a Power Cogeneration study to survey the market potential and identify
opportunities for private sector participation and PPP. As part o f i t s strategy in the energy sector,
I F C i s helping the institutional effort to develop PPP opportunities in Costanza-Pancevo-OmisaljTrieste (CPOT) Oil pipeline project. CPOT i s a cross border o i l transportation pipeline which i s
expected to offer an environmentally safe alternative route to bring high quality Central Asian and
Russian crude oil to Southern and Western Europe, crossing Romania, Serbia and Montenegro,
and Croatia. This pipeline i s strongly supported by the governments o f these countries. The
United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has financed a feasibility study with a
grant to the Croatian Government on behalf o f the three interested countries. IFC i s supporting a
second phase o f a TA assignment, focused o n providing capacity building to the three country
Interstate Committee. This Committee i s responsible for the pre-development strategy and
coordination o f early institutional efforts to assess feasibility and prepare the project legal
framework and to promote the project with potential investors and users. I F C will consider the
possibility o f financing this project, subject to the pipeline's economic indicators and business
interests from strong sponsors.
Social Sectors

I F C will explore opportunities to bring a strategic investor and to finance the establishment o f the
MBA School for the University of Belgrade, as w e l l as for a private polyclinic in Belgrade.
Another foreseen opportunity exists with respect to the restructuring o f the Igalo Health Center.

SME Sector
SaM i s s t i l l far from having a business environment attractive to entrepreneurs and investors.
Consequently, the number o f SMEs i s far below the CEE average; Serbia i s even lagging behind
within the more geographically limited SEE region. The weak interest in S M E lending i s due
largely to the high fixed costs of loan processing, the practice o f informal accounting, and the
reliance on mortgages which are difficult to enforce. Lines o f credit funded by international
financial institutions (e.g. EAR, EIB, KfW) and supported by TA for credit risk assessment and
management have prompted some progress in lending to SMEs. However, the majority o f credit
applications are rejected because o f the lack o f transparency in financial statements, inadequate
collateral, incomplete business plans, or insufficient capitalization o f the borrowers. IFC i s
developing new investment opportunities for intermediary lending operations with selected
commercial banks aimed at increasing access to finance for SMEs.

IFC i s supporting the S M E sector through the Southeast Europe Enterprise Development (SEED)
facility, a multi-donor partnership led by IFC, operating in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Serbia and Montenegro and FYR Macedonia. SEED continues to focus i t s efforts o n supporting:
(i)increased competitiveness of SMEs in the region: (ii)
strengthened business development
improvements in the business environment for SMEs. T o better
services (BDS) markets: and (iii)
position i t s e l f on hlfilling i t s mandate, SEED has recently introduced a new integrated and
demand-driven approach, targeting four major strategic objectives as indicated in the CAS text
B o x 7. This approach ensures integration o f SEED'S products with the needs o f the local key
partner by mobilizing internal and external resources to act as a local implementer. This has
55

Annex 3
brought significant scope to SEED's activities allowing i t to operate on several levels including
consulting,
training, capacity building programs and business enabling environment interventions. In 2004,
SEED came under the direct management o f IFC's SECA hub in Istanbul. Existing ties have been
strengthened to enable a fully inclusive investment and TA strategy to evolve in the region. A
clearer set o f deliverables to our host country i s n o w punctuated by a fully integrated approach to
addressing the need to t i e technical assistance more closely to IFC's investment work.

Annex 3 Box 2: Some Notable Achievements o f SEED
IFC's SEED facility has been operating in Serbia and Montenegro since 2001. Since then the country program
has had some notable achievements, including the following.
1. The financial leasing law was passed with the help o f SEED in M a y 2003. Twelve leasing companies have
been established. Also, SEED helped to broker an agreement between all the leasing companies to form the
Association o f Leasing Companies in Serbia. The value o f leasing contracts reached Euro150 million in the f i r s t
year o f business. Estimates show that growth o f 30 percent per annum i s expected and by 2008 the leasing
industry may account for as much as Euro 500million a year.
2. Following up on the investment made by IFC into the Tigar Tyre Plant, SEED developed an extensive
provided assistance on identification o f i t s nonprogram to advise the company o n critical linkage projects: (i)
core assets and plans to spin them off; (ii)
advised o n the development o f a franchised retail and distribution
)
and advised Tigar AD and
system in the country to support i t s core t i r e manufacturing function; and (iiitrained
i t s distribution staff on the dynamics o f a modem supply chain.
3. IFC's SEED and Corporate Citizenship Facilities joined up to support an Herbal Business Association based
in southern of Serbia, an economically depressed region. SEED's program follows i t s tested business
the association has engaged the government to establish a
association model and achieved the following: (i)
quote system for collection and as a result an improved licensing mechanism to control the collection o f w i l d
herbs has been introduced; (ii)
provided 13 different training modules to 300 collectors in co-operation with
local NGOs; and (iii)
in one year, increased more then three times the membership o f the association.

4. I F C SEED has been undertaking additional assessments for commercial loans to qualify for a risk reserve

scheme established by Austria Wirtshaftsservice GmbH (AWS). T o date, the scheme has contributed Euro8
million to fourteen SMEs. Each loan i s unique in the market for i t s lowered collateral coverage, longer tenor and
pricing. SEED intends to further extend this successful project.

Annex 5

Core Labor Standards
B o t h Serbia and Montenegro have ratified (or re-ratified the conventions which were ratified by exYugoslavia) a l l 8 ILO core labor conventions. These conventions are: Forced Labor (No. 29),
Abolition o f Forced Labor (No. 105); Minimum Age (No. 138), Worst Forms o f Child Labor (No.
182); Equal Remuneration (No. loo), Discrimination in Employment and Occupation (No. 111);
Freedom o f Association (No. 87), Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining (No. 98). In recent
years, national legislation was largely updated with respect to provisions in the above named
conventions.
In Serbia, the legislative framework o f collective bargaining and social dialogue includes the following
laws and agreements: the Labor A c t (2001), the Employment and Unemployment Insurance A c t
and the Founding Agreement o f the Socio-economic
(2003), the General Collective Agreement (200 l),
Council o f the Republic o f Serbia (2001). In Montenegro, the legal framework i s based on the new
Labor L a w (2003), the L a w on Terms and Conditions o f Employment (2002), the General Collective
Agreement (2003), and the Government Decree On the Establishment o f the Economic and Social
Council (2001).

The key event in the development o f social dialogue in Serbia was the establishment o f Socioeconomic Council in August 200 1. Regional Socio-economic councils were also established in 26
industrial centers in Serbia. The experience with the work o f the Council has been mixed. Shortly
after the setting up o f the Council i t s work was broken down by the leave o f one o f the union
representatives. The Council remained blocked till April 2002 when a new mutual “Agreement o n
Improving the W o r k o f the Social Economic Council” was concluded by the parties involved and the
work restarted.
The new Labor A c t defines some criteria for representativeness o f trade unions and employers’
organizations: a trade union affiliating at least 15 percent o f all the employees o f an employer i s
considered a representative trade union for the conclusion o f the collective contract with the employer,
and an affiliation o f at least 10 percent o f the employers in the Republic or in the branch or activity for
which the collective contract i s being concluded i s considered a representative employers association.
The following organizations m a y qualify as representative organizations o f social partners: from the
trade unions’ side, Association o f Free and Independent Trade Unions, Federation o f Autonomous
Trade Unions o f Serbia, United Branch Trade Union “Nezavisnost” (Independence), and from the
employers’ side, Union o f Serbian Employers and Serbian Association o f Industry and entrepreneur^.^^
However, while collective agreements at the national level have a long tradition in both Serbia and
Montenegro, the strategy for development o f collective agreements at other levels o f the society, and
especially at the enterprise and local levels need to be created.

One o f the features of the Serbian labor legislation i s that by the new Labor A c t from 200 1, and similar
to few other countries in Europe, the minister in charge o f labor m a y expand the application o f the
special collective agreements to include the non-members o f the employers association. The minister
i s obliged to request the opinion o f the signatories to the collective contract before deciding about such
expansion. The possibility was not provided by the previous legislation.

The MoLSP i s in the process o f determining organizations that can be considered nationwide as the representative trade
unions and the representative employers’ associations respectively.

36

58

Annex 5
In Montenegro, while the Ministry o f Labor and Social Protection i s cooperating with other employers’
organizations, such as Union o f Employers o f Montenegro, Montenegro Business Alliance, and
Montenegro Business Market, by the Labor L a w the General Collective Agreement can be signed only
by the Chamber o f Commerce as the only representative o f employers. Companies are obliged to pay a
contribution to the Chamber o f Commerce (0.32 percent o f gross salaries o f every worker). This
violates ILO recommendations (in particular, Recommendation N o 113 and 152 and Convention N o
144), which suggest that the social partners can only be the voluntary organizations o f workers and
employers, and not the chambers o f commerce that exist on the basis o f the legal obligations o f the
companies to pay the contributions to them. Trade unions are represented by one union - the
Federation o f Independent Trade Unions o f Montenegro. All workers, with n o regard to their
membership, have to pay a contribution to the union (0.2 percent o f their gross salaries).

Representation o f worker voice through unions and collective bargaining tend to reduce discrimination.
Unions are also known to reduce wage disparities within their members; ensure management abides by
collective agreements and the law; and improve working conditions in firms. But unions can also
impose efficiency costs.
Also successful development o f the system o f collective bargaining depends o n proper the interactive
confidence among the main actors involved. In Serbia, however, due to the difficulties the social
partners have faced the level o f confidence among them has not reached yet the necessary level.
Consequently reestablishing the confidence constitutes serious challenge for further development o f
collective bargaining.

The new Labor Act of Serbia and the Labor L a w o f Montenegro provide protection against
discrimination o f any employee in the workplace based o n gender, birth place, language, race, national
identity, religion, marital status, family responsibilities, political or any other viewpoint, social
background, personal wealth, membership in particular political organization, Unions or any other
personal trait. The integration o f disadvantaged persons in the labor market i s important to prevent
social exclusion, to raise employment rates and to provide for sustainability o f social protection
system.
Despite an updated legislation, recent labor market analyses in SaM have revealed that there are
individuals a n d o r groups o f individuals that are currently facing difficulties in accessing and
remaining in the labor market. Some o f the difficulties identified are explicit or hidden forms o f
gender, disability or ethnic discrimination. W h i l e in the formal sector o f the economy, core labor
standards are basically enforced, not much i s known about relevant labor relations in the informal
sector. Calculations based on the Serbia L S M S suggest that informal employment i s very significant
and accounted for 31 and 35 percent o f the total employment in 2002 and 2003, respectively. In
Montenegro, around 30 percent o f employed people are believed to work without contract.
The World Bank i s engaged in a number o f activities that promote good practice related to core labor
standards. Bank efforts to enhance the participatory process o f PRSPs specifically involve trade
unions. The Bank has already engaged in some efforts to enhance the capacity o f the social partners in
Serbia as well, including involvement in regional PRSP training events along with other members o f
c i v i l society and training events specifically geared for trade unions active in the PRSP process.
The Bank was actively involved in preparation o f the new Labor A c t in Serbia and the Labor L a w in
Montenegro. In Serbia, the Bank has also provided technical assistance or financially supported the
preparation o f other relevant labor legislation, via SOSAC loan and SPEAG Grant, including the
Employment and Unemployment Insurance Act; and the following laws s t i l l in draft: o n Employers’
Associations; on Trade Unions, o n Socio-Economic Council; and o n Strikes.

Annex 6

Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
Attention to money laundering and terrorist financing has increased because these activities are
recognized not only as serious risks to security, but they also seriously affect a country’s ability to
improve financial stability and establish a level playing-field for private sector (particularly SME)
development. Serbia and Montenegro have made notable efforts over the past two years to l a y the
legal foundations necessary for the implementation o f international standards for anti-money
laundering. This i s important as organized criminal groups, engaging in the illegal smuggling o f
drugs, humans and other commodities, are believed to be active in the region
The first l a w o n anti-money laundering adopted by the FRY Parliament in July 2002. This l a w
made money laundering a criminal activity, and authorized the creation o f a Financial Intelligence
Unit (FIU) at the national level. Due to the constitutional transition to the U n i o n o f Serbia and
Montenegro, and subsequent autonomy agreements between the two republics the AML l a w was
adopted by the Serbian Republic Parliament and the FIU became an agency o f the Serbian
government. Montenegro has since adopted i t s o w n AML l a w and i s in the process o f
establishing a separate FIU. Thus, Serbia has progressed farther in implementing international
AML standards than Montenegro, and i s laudably serving as a ‘mentor’ to both Montenegro3’ and
Bosnia38in their A M L / C F T efforts. Serbia and Montenegro are (‘jointly) a member in the Council
o f Europe’s Anti-Money Laundering Committee (MONEYVAL), however, only Serbia has to
date met standards for membership in, and been accepted as a member o f the Egmont
Although the AMLKFT regimes in Serbia and Montenegro are gradually developing, laws in
both republics which criminalize terrorist financing are s t i l l needed, as are various amendments to
the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code in order to meet international standards. Due to
the international nature o f money laundering and terrorist finan~ing,~’
autonomous territories in
which enforcement o f national laws may be weaker provide attractive havens for money
launderers, organized crime groups and financiers o f terrorism to profitably thrive and evade
authorities. This situation also makes it relatively easy for criminal groups to conduct profitable
activities in territories where A M L / C F T enforcement i s stronger, yet hide their profits and
proceeds in the territories where enforcement may be weaker. This critical problem can only be
addressed by a high degree o f coordination and cooperation between financial sector supervisors
and law enforcement authorities o f these adjacent countries and territories. Among the Republics
and territories o f Serbia and Montenegro, such coordination and cooperation i s improving but
work i s s t i l l needed o n the (sub-) regional level. In both Serbia and Montenegro, resources are
needed to build capacity, and for technical assistance and training particularly for analysts in the
FIU, as well as for Ministry o f Justice officials, prosecutors and judges who handle money
laundering and terrorist financing cases.

37 Serbia F I U officials have assessed the FIU in Montenegro in the context o f i t s application for membership in the Egmont
Group. Serbia plans to sponsor Montenegro’s application for membership in Egmont (see footnote 3.)
38 Serbian FIU officials have been providing a limited amount o f advice and technical assistance to the Bosnian FIU which
will become operational on 28 December 2004. Serbia FIU officials will make an on-site visit to the Bosnia FIU in January,
2005.
39 The Egmont Group i s the recognized international network o f FIUs, the goal o f which i s to enhance mutual legal assistance
and coordination in A M L I C F T activities.
40 Most money laundering and terrorist financing activities involve cross-border transactions.

Annex 7

WBI activities in Serbia and Montenegro, FY05 - FY07
Summary: Significant capacity constraints pose a risk that the three broad goals identified in the
CAS will not be reached to the extent hoped for. Weak institutional capacity i s a common
problem in the public, private and social sectors. The current and proposed WBI programs will
complement the Bank Group’s AAA activities in Serbia and Montenegro intended to address the
challenges to making progress towards meeting these goals.
Capacity constraints: The CAS identifies three goals: (i)
a more efficient public sector, (ii)
a
more dynamic private sector and (iii)
lower poverty levels and improved social protectiodaccess
to k e y public services as key objectives. Supporting Bank activities would include a substantial
non-lending program to which WBI would contribute.
In designing and implementing the AAA programs, a k e y issue to address i s that institutions
generally remain weak despite relatively high education levels. There i s significant capacity
constraints associated with the CAS objectives:

Economic and public sector management: Institutional reform priorities include strengthening
arrangements for budget planning and execution, developing multi-year planning mechanisms
and improving accountability. Key targets include containing items o f public spending (wage
bills, social transfers, subsidies), expanding the share o f budgetary transactions covered by the
treasury systems, and strengthening o f the internal audit hnctions o f the Ministries o f
Finance. Institutional strengthening i s needed to implement policies for sustained macroeconomic stability and the external balance, and to build effective union and republican
institutions able to support both economic and judicial reform.
Private sector development: Within the broader capacity objective o f building institutions
that are able to foster a stable business environment, specific capacity gaps include the ability
to pursue the privatization agenda and support the growth o f exports (and trade in general). In
addition, there remains a need to establish the proper “division o f labor” between the public,
c i v i l and private/corporate sectors o f society, and strengthen the institutions that implement
the policies behind this.
Social sector development: Capacity gaps include weak institutions responsible for the broad
poverty reduction agenda and, more specifically, improving the social well-being o f the most
vulnerable groups. Legislation and regulations related to health, education and pensions are
either in place or will be so in the foreseeable future, but appropriate implementation remains
a challenge. The 2003 PRSP pledges for government to do more for vulnerable groups,
including the Roma.

Current and future activities: Current and h t u r e WBI supported activities address issues
which are linked primarily with the C A S Goals 2 and 3 and include the following.
Goal 2: Private sector development: T w o countries specific and one regional activity are
currently supported by WBI.

61

Annex 7
Export promotion: Workshops on improving export promotion and support to the
Serbian export promotion agencies are being carried out during FY05, and
complement related ECSPF activities.
(ii) Small and medium enterprises development and restructuring;/privatization: This
program focuses on training and institution strengthening o f the Serbian PA and also
complements ECSPF's work in this field. Activities in FY05 include two 2-day
workshops with emphasis on contract enforcement and private sector regulation,
respectively, complemented by GDLN video conferences on the m a i n findings o f the
recently completed Serbia and Montenegro Investment Climate Assessment.
(iii) Knowledge economy: WBI staff recently led a small team which prepared a series o f
knowledge economy assessments for the Balkan region and countries. There i s n o w a
proposal for ECSPF to develop a more focused and project oriented output with
emphasis three specific thematic areas and the linkages between them: (i)
enhancing
applied R&D, knowledge transfer and innovation in the enterprise sector, (ii)
increasing telecom density and internet penetration, and (iii)scaling up o f egovernment services. WBI would stay involved in follow-up activities as requested
by ECSPF, including the development o f policy recommendations and further
involvement o f and discussions with relevant stakeholders in SaM and the other
countries.

(i)

As the current country specific activities are completed (2005), WBI would consider shifting i t s
PSD work further to regional activities, possibly to promote private participation in, and regional
integration of, infrastructure (transport, energy).

PRSP Process: Activities supporting the PRSP process have focused o n a series o f development
debates and seminars open to all Balkan countries, including SAM, where participants involved in
their country's PRSP process exchange experiences. The latest round o f development debates
took place in early 2004, mainly through video conferencing, and was followed by a well-attended
Second PRSP Forum in Thessalonica, Greece. Follow-up activities may include a Basic Poverty
Measurement and Diagnostics course in mid FY05 with clinics on topics determined by the
participating countries' PRSP teams, and further development debates and a Third PRSP Forum.
WBI's evaluation group could also offer learning events on monitoring and evaluation based o n
Bank supported projects"
In the field o f social sector development, WBI support focuses o n regional follow-up activities to
the Roma conference, including policy dialogue and capacity building through country and
regional training. M a i n activities planned for FY05 include regional training o n select topics
including a course on Social Accountability and Monitoring, and support o f Roma participation in
various activities. Websites and virtual learning environments would be supported to promote
regional networking for on-going dialogues and on-line information exchanges with special
emphasis on education issues and Roma women.
In addition, S A M delegates would continue to be invited to other regional and global WBI
programs throughout the planning period. The scope o f and audience for such invitations would
be determinedjointly with the Bank's Country Office in Belgrade. For both the country specific
and regional/global programs, the GDLN Network will be used as appropriate to ensure cost
efficiency and maximum knowledge sharing and dissemination.

Partnerships: WBI activities are developed in collaboration with local and international
counterparts and donors, and coordinated with the Country Offices and relevant task teams in
ECA. The PSD activities are supported by an Italian Trust Fund and Universita Cattaneo

MIGA in Serbia and Montenegro
SaM has been a member o f MIGA since 1993. MIGA i s a key partner for the government o f SaM
through the provision o f guarantees and technical assistance, to help the country attract foreign
investment.
Guarantees. MIGA currently has fourteen guarantee contracts in SaM: twelve in the financial
sector, one in the services sector and one in the manufacturing sector. MIGA’s total gross exposure
in SaM i s US$296.3 million. MIGA i s considering two projects in i t s pipeline for SaM. One i s in
the financial sector (leasing) and the other in the services sector (retail), with a total potential for
MIGA coverage o f US$35.7 million. These projects are expected to be underwrittenand executed by
the end o f FY05.
Technical Assistance. MIGA i s currently completing i t s support to a long-term, 18-months capacity
building program for SIEPA. The hands-on institutional development program focuses o n the
preparation o f an FDI promotion strategy for SIEPA, the strengthening o f necessary investment
promotion and facilitation skills in the agency, and the implementation o f a series o f pilot investor
outreach programs in a number o f priority sectors. The program i s funded under a World Bank
Private Sector Development grant to Serbia and benefited from strong cross-links with other
economic development programs, such as USAID’s competitiveness project and the EAR’S export
development and S M E support programs in Serbia. EAR has asked MIGA to help design and
manage a follow-on assistance program that will help further strengthen Serbia’s investment
promotion capacity. It i s expected that the EAWMIGA program will be launched in early CY05,
subject to the Serbian government fiilfilling a number o f conditions (such as the passing o f the l a w on
SIEPA).
In April 2004, with donor funding from the European Agency for Reconstruction, MIGA also
launched a new technical assistance program in Montenegro, aimed at assisting the country in
establishing a new investment facilitation and servicing unit. The one-year program will support the
establishment o f the unit, including the development o f a start-up strategy and work plan, skills
development and training, and support for initial information dissemination activities.

Serbia and Montenegro both also benefit from a new regional initiative that MIGA i s launching for
the Western Balkan region. Under the European Investor Outreach Program (EIOP), MIGA will
implement over the next two and a h a l f years a donor-funded pilot initiative that has been designed to
strengthen the capability o f Western Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, FYR
Macedonia, and Serbia and Montenegro) to attract inward investment from across Western Europe.
The goal i s to increase investor awareness o f the region’s potential, encourage investors to undertake
site visits to explore investment opportunities, and ultimately to support actual investments in the
region.

MIGA’s on-line investment promotion services (www.fdixchange.com and www.ipanet.net) feature
270 documents on investment opportunities and the related legal and regulatory environment in SaM.
MIGA also has established a content provider partnership for i t s online services with the Serbian
Ministry o f Economy and Privatization and with SIEPA.
