ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The W o r l d Bank Group greatly appreciates the collaboration and contributions o f the Government o f
India in the preparation o f this Country Strategy paper. In particular, officials o f the Ministry o f Finance
provided extensive review o f drafts and important guidance as to where Bank assistance might be helpful

to India. W e would also like to thank the many (several hundred) interested persons in India who gave o f
their time to participate in the consultation process o f the Country Strategy. The contributions o f this
very large and diverse group - state government officials, external financing agencies, the private sector,
non-governmental organizations, representatives o f academic institutions, members o f the media and
other development partners -have proven to be valuable in thinking through the constraints to and
opportunities for poverty reduction in India, as w e l l as formulating the approaches described in this paper.

Within the W o r l d Bank Group, the Country Strategy was prepared by the ’India Country Strategy Team’,
comprised o f more than 25 staff and managers across the South Asia regional units o f IBRDIIDA and
IFC. The extended India team also participated actively, providing very useful advice and ideas during
several brainstorming sessions held in N e w Delhi, and by videoconference to the Washington offices.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
This Country Strategy (CAS) sets out h o w the W o r l d B a n k Group proposes to build a growing
partnership with the Government o f India (GoI) during FY05-08 - a critical period in the pledge to help
our clients meet the global Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including halving poverty, by 20 15.
With over one-quarter o f the world’s poor (some 260-290 m i l l i o n people) in India, our efforts to assist
India with best practice knowledge and financing for development are central to the W o r l d Bank Group’s
mission to help reduce global poverty. The overarching clzallenge of this new strategy will be how w e
can mnxiniize and leverage the diverse resources of the Bank Grotip’to dranzatically scale tip our
impact, help to improve the quality of lye for some of the world’spoorest citizens and help Iridin inove
closer to achieving the MDGs.
In order to achieve this enhanced impact, three Strategic Principles will underpin the Bank
Group’s work: (i)focusing on outcomes, to ensure that a l l o f the w o r k o f the Bank Group i s explicitly
geared towards supporting India’s achievement o f i t s development goals; (ii)
applying selectivity, to target
limited resources to activities where assistance i s welcomed and where contributions can also be the most
effective; and (iii)
expanding the Bank Group role as a politically realistic knowledge provider and
generator.

2.

3.
In applying these Strategic Principles, the Bank i s seeking a substantial increase in i t s volume o f
lending to India. Given the enormous needs, the expansion will primarily be in (i)
infrastructure (roads,
transport, power, water supply and sanitation, irrigation and urban development - to underpin both
accelerated growth and improved service delivery); (ii)
huniari development (education, health, social
protection - priorities to support specific MDGs); and (iii)r u r a l livelihoods (with an emphasis on
community-driven approaches).
Scaling up will require a strengthened program at the Center, including more national l e v e l
4.
lending as w e l l as lending to the states compared to recent years. An important shift envisioned for
FY05-08 i s the use o f n e w approaches, including co-financing with other development partners under
common arrangements, for national programs in the areas most critical to meeting the MDGs. Using such

means, including ‘sector-wide approaches’ or SWAps where appropriate, the Bank will seek to step up i t s
national level engagement and w o r k closely with partners that can j o i n the B a n k in providing substantial
assistance.
Some important shifts are also being implemented in the approach to India’s states. Since 1997,
5.
the CAS has included a focus o n states undertaking comprehensive reforms, in order to support the
leaders o f change and serve as a catalyst to the state-level reform process. With the widening gulf

between faster and slower growing states in India, leading to a concentration o f poverty and poor social
indicators in just a f e w states, some shifts in this approach are warranted. Though the strategy will retain
an essentially reform and performance-based approach to the states, i t will also change in ways that are
intended to go as far as possible in opening up n e w opportunities for engagement with these largest and
poorest states:

First, in consultation with Go1 and other partners, the Bank will seek to ensure that all o f the largest
and poorest states o f India that so wish are engaged in a dialogue on cross-cutting reforms (fiscal
management, governance, service delivery, the power sector and the investment climate)

’ In this report, the “Bank Group” refers to IBRD, IDA, IFC and MICA; and the “Bank” refers to IBRDiID.4
1

Secondly, the Bank will w o r k proactively to try to build a productive development relationship with
four states where poverty i s increasingly concentrated in India and where public institutions are
considered to be at their weakest - Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and U P . This support could go beyond
the basic dialogue o n cross-cutting reforms noted above.

Thirdly, state-level adjustment lending operations aimed at supporting achievement o f the MDGs, are
also expected to remain an important part o f the Bank program. In addition to supporting state
government efforts to reduce fiscal deficits, reform the power sector, strengthen governance and
implement a range o f actions to improve the investment climate -this lending w o u l d support cross-

cutting actions to improve service delivery.

Fourthly, there i s n o longer an upfront decision to concentrate substantial state-level investment
lending o n ‘focus states’ that are also receiving adjustment lending in support o f cross-cutting
reforms. Instead, investment lending will be channeled more broadly to states that are able to comply
with new ‘guidelines for engagement’ for the relevant sector. These guidelines attempt to clearly set
out the sector-specific conditions that experience has shown to be necessary for project success. As
described further in the CAS, in implementing these guidelines the B a n k will also seek, when
possible, to provide i t s investment lending to the states that have the greatest number o f poor citizens,
or weakest indicators, in order to maximize i t s impact.
The overall impact o f these changes i s likely t o be a progressive shift in the share o f lending that goes to
the poorest states, though dependent o n the extent to which basic conditions for these projects can be m e t
by those states.
Despite these shifts in the way that the Bank partners with both the Center and the states, the
6.
B a n k Group’s Program Priorities will retain considerable continuity with the FY02-04 CAS. The
emphasis on: Improving Government Effectiveness; Investing in People and Einpowesing Coininztnities;
and Promoting Private-Sector Led Growth remains relevant to India’s o w n priorities and development
goals. The stepped up program will provide increased opportunity for collaboration across the Bank
Group to promote innovative public-private partnerships for infrastructure development. The Private
Sector Development Strategy attached to this paper provides detail on h o w this collaboration can be
further developed.
W i t h i n the Program Priorities, IFC will continue to provide equity and loan financing and
7.
guarantees to supplement what i s available f r o m Indian financial institutions or capital markets, and will
help to mobilize financing f r o m b o t h domestic and international sources. This will include pioneering
investments in infrastructure where innovative structures and long tenors are required; and investments in
projects which are constrained by limited r i s k appetite o f other investors, including medium-sized
manufacturing companies, agribusiness companies and companies entering n e w markets domestically and
internationally.

8.
For the Bank, global knowledge support - policy dialogue, analysis, technical assistance and
advisory services - will be re-focused to better support the Program Priorities. The strategy calls for
enhanced focus o n major analytical w o r k o n emerging issues o f national interest, as well as strengthening
the demand-driven nature o f the Bank’s advisory work.
9
The CAS notes that, based o n country performance ratings and India’s absorpti\ e capacit), a
substantially higher l e v e l o f IDA resources could effectively be utilized by India Particularly in human
development and rural livelihoods, increased lending will depend o n availability o f IDA resources, \\hose
expansion would be justified by the opportunity t o contribute to achieving the MDGs Beyond any
ceilings that are imposed by the IDA Deputies, the C A S will n o t place additional constraints o n India’s

11

IDA resources unless a dramatic unforeseen deterioration in performance warrants a review o f the overall
strategy .

10.
The C A S also proposes a new way o f looking at IBRD lending. Rather than establishing l o w or
base case scenarios for Bank lending, and structuring triggers to shift f r o m one case to another, the Bank
program will fall within a range limited by an upper bound for IBRD lending (US$2.15 billion per year
on average) to support India’s achievement o f MDGs. Getting to this upper bound will require strong
reform performance as well as a strengthened pace o f project preparation.

11.

As i s currently the case, the level o f IBRD investment lending to the states w i l l depend on the
pace o f reform implementation and application o f ‘self-regulating’ triggers. Unlike the recent past,
however, the guidelines for engagement will increase the transparency o f the triggers for state level
investment lending and open up opportunities for an increased number o f states to engage with the Bank.
These guidelines also specify n e w triggers for investment lending with the Center.

FY05-08 WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY STRATEGY FOR INDIA
Introduction
1.
Supported by wide-ranging reforms, India has experienced rapid growth by most standards over
the past decade (averaging about 6 percent per year between 1992/3 and 20031’4). The external position o f
India’s economy has also improved dramatically. The rapid growth o f information technology (IT)
service exports and high remittances have resulted in current account surpluses. Together with modest
capital inflows, this has generated a substantial increase in external reserves, which n o w exceed US$lOO
billion. L o w levels o f short-term external debt give the country a further cushion to counter any
speculative attack.
2.
In parallel with this faster growth, India has made impressive progress towards reducing income
poverty, an important element o f the MDGs. Continued progress has also been made o n many social
indicators, particularly literacy, which rose f r o m 52 percent in 1991 to 65 percent in 2001’. These
improvements are both real achievements for India - and achievements o f global significance.

3.

However, while India’s economic and social performance has been impressive o n many accounts,

i t has also been uneven and has fallen behind the performance o f a number o f countries in East Asia.

Despite the emergence o f tens o f millions f r o m poverty during the 199Os, average incomes across India
remain l o w and there has been little movement o n some critical social indicators. A great concern i s that
b o t h maternal and under-five mortality have hardly improved. In addition, H I V i A I D S i s spreading
quickly, with r i s k factors that put the country in danger o f a growing epidemic. Though Go1 and
U N A I D S estimate that less than one percent o f the adult population i s currently infected with HIV - with
a population o f more than one b i l l i o n people, India will soon have more people infected with HIV than
any other country in the world. H I V / A I D S clearly has the potential to upset much o f the good progress
that India has made.

4.

In India today, there also remains a substantial and persistent disparity o f opportunity, particularly
in the education, health and economic prospects o f women and other vulnerable groups such as the
Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (SC/ ST) populations. A symptom o f this disparity i s the strikingly l o w
ratio o f girls to boys, which, rather than improving with India’s development progress, appears to be
worsening. A growing gulf has emerged as w e l l in growth between the richer and poorer states within the
country - with the result that poverty i s increasingly geographically concentrated. Today, almost h a l f o f
India’s poor, approximately 133 m i l l i o n people, live in Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar 01- Madhya Pradesh
(MP). Over three quarters o f the poor live in rural areas.

Given these disparities, and the increasing concentration o f poverty by region and by state, i t can
5.
be said that India occupies two worlds simultaneously. The first, where economic reform and social

changes, such as improved education for girls, have begun to take h o l d and where growth has had an
impact o n people’s lives and opportunities - and the other, where citizens appear almost completely l e f t
behind by public services, employment opportunities and brighter prospects Bridging t h e gap between
these two worlds i s perhaps the greatest challenge faced by Go1 today.

D o i n g so will require continued high economic growth to underpin increased inconies into the
6
future. I t will also require greater focus on ensuring that the fruits o f growth are shared more evenly.
Sustaining the growth o f the recent past and India’s progress in poverty reduction will also require
dramatic improvements in basic infrastructure and the investment cliiiiate M a j o r changes will need to be

’National Statistical Suivey (NSS), Office o f the Registrar General, I n d i a

made to ensure effective delivery o f basic services, such as improved health and education, to all o f
India's citizens. And these improvements will need to be achieved within the context o f the longer-term
strategic challenges that India faces: ensuring environmental sustainability in the context o f diminishing
water availability, increasing pollution and global climate change; the demographics o f continued, albeit
slower, population growth; a reduced girl/boy ratio; and the possible course o f H I V / A I D S .

I.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

The Country Context
While the country context for the FY02-04 strategy period was marked by the political stability o f
7.
a 24-party federal coalition, i t has also been notable for economic policy, particularly r e f o n i i initiatives,
being pursued at an uneven pace. A few important underlying trends have impacted o n India's refonn
progress, and progress towards meeting the MDGs, in recent years.

8.
The first o f these trends has been the urban elite's growing confidence about India's place on the
w o r l d stage. This confidence has been fueled by several factors: the growth in the last decade o f a vibrant
middle-class with spending power; high recent economic growth and India's strong external position; the
IT boom in w h i c h India i s emerging as a global leader; the achievements o f the Indian diaspora; improved
relations with all major w o r l d powers; and the readiness o f a new generation o f industrialists and
entrepreneurs t o compete globally. With i t s influence magnified by an expanding print and electronic
media, this class o f urban elite has become the key driver o f India's liberalizing agenda.

A second trend, related to the first, i s the slow but growing assertiveness o f less privileged
sections o f Indian society. Through the 1990s, this was seen in the rise o f political parties largely
9.

representing the less privileged and regional aspirations and their influence on the federal polity.
Multiple-party governments at the Center and some o f the major states based o n miniinuiii common
agendas and pragmatic power-sharing have resulted in greater durability o f coalition govei-nments. This
democratic assertion and sharing o f political power has had the positive effect o f increasing
empowerment o f historically weaker sections, but the quality o f governance and the delivery o f services
remain uneven.
Finally, increasingly politically-articulated aspirations for jobs, infrastructure and health,
10.
education and sanitation services, have highlighted the necessity o f institutional and policy refonn,
decentralization, and employment-friendly growth policies. The forthcoming C A S period will see an
intensification o f the struggle to match these needs with short-term political demands. In particular,
creating incentives to improve service delivery to the poor will remain a challenge.

11.
This new Bank Group C A S coincides with a fresh goveming cycle at the Center and in major
states. In elections held in A p r i l M a y 2004, the government at the Center and in the states o f Andhra
Pradesh (AP) and Kamatalta were voted out. In an earlier set o f state elections in late-2003, governments
were also voted out in the states o f Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh. The new government at the Center,
which i s a coalition led by the Congress party (which initiated the process o f economic reforms and
liberalization in the early 1990s) i s n o w supported by leftist parties. The ruling alliance has agreed o n a
Common Minimum Program as i t s policy agenda, which retains the broadly liberal economic policy
thrust o f the last decade but with a strengthened emphasis o n social programs and benefits to l o w income
groups, especially in rural areas.

2

12.
With the completion o f elections, the n e w governments at the Center and these states face the
challenge o f protecting vulnerable sections and investing in infrastructure and rural development, w h i l e
facing up to the prime necessity o f fiscal and power reform and creating conditions that would encourage
private investors and employment-oriented growth. During the forthcoming strategy period, states will be
faced with decisions o n contentious issues such as rationalizing power and water subsidies, partnering
with the private sector to deliver basic services, and giving further impetus to decentralization. M a n y o f
these decisions will be hotly contested, which should place development issues into the center o f the
political agenda.

R e c e n t Social Progress and Outlook
13.
By many measures, India has made good progress in reducing poverty and improving the welfare
o f i t s citizens in recent years. The Bank’s 2003 Development Policy Review - “India: Szwtaiiziug
Refom, Reducing Poverty” (DPR) provides a detailed discussion. Official estimates show a decline in
poverty f r o m 36 percent in the early 1990s to 26.1 percent in 1999-2000, but attempts to adjust the
household survey underlying the 1999-2000 figures to make i t comparable with earlier surveys result in a
smaller degree o f poverty reduction; h o w much smaller i s a matter o f considerable debate and estimates
3
vary widely.

Organization. Sanitation-India, Office o f the Registrar General 1981, 1991 2001; and National Family Health Survey.

In addition to the reduction in poverty incidence, education indicators have improved markedly.
14.
F o r the first time since independence, the absolute number o f illiterate citizens in India declined between
1991 and 2001. Literacy rates rose particularly for women. Enrollment rates o f primary-aged children
also increased, and the gap between enrollment ratios for boys and girls declined.

However, against these achievements, progress in improving health indicators in India has been
15.
mixed. Reductions in the infant mortality rate (IMR) slowed during the previous decade and higher IMRs
have persisted among disadvantaged groups such as the SC/ST population (Box 1 provides additional
context to this problem). Progress in addressing malnutrition has been minimal. Based o n existing data,
the maternal mortality rate has worsened; however there are problems with the data f o r this indicator in
Box 1: Why do infants and young children die in India?
India has achieved reniarltable progress in reducing infant and child (under 5) mortality in tlic past 25 years, nearly halving the
nation-wide IMR froni 1975 to 2000. However, much o f this success took place in the 19&Os, while there \vas a sharp
slowdown in improving this critical indicator in the 1990s -the average reduction in IMR per year slowed from 3.5 perccnt in
1981-1990 to 1 .8 percent in 1991-2000. A t tlie same time, many other countries i n South and East Asia, including ticighboring
Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, have managed to maintain an IMR reduction o f 3 percent or more annually. Even more worrisonie,
India’s under-5 mortality rate hardly improved in the 1990s, remaining more than 2.5 times higher than in China.

In order for India to achieve a reduction i n IMR from 6 8 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 2000 to 45 by 2007 and to 28 by
2012, as targeted in the Tenth Plan, the annual decline should jump to nearly 5 percent, which i s a very tough challenge. Tnterstate disparities imply that the challenge i s even tougher than the national data suggests, since the poorer, lagging states will

have to achieve much greater reductions.

What are the main factors contributing to infant and child mortality i n India? According to India’s National Faniily Hcaltli
Surveys (NFHS), for every 68 infant deaths, 43 ofthese happen during the neonatal period (first 28 days). Since a large
nuniber o f these deaths take placc at home, global studies indicate that improving home based behaviors rclatcd to brcastfeeding, oral rehydration and newborn temperature management, can have a strong impact on child survival. Increasing the
‘birth spacing’, or interval before the next child in the family can also impact child survival. This i s an important issue for
India, where permanent methods o f family planning are predominantly used.
Recent studies also highlight the importance o f focusing on a range o f socio-economic parameters and cultural issucs in
addition to better health care. Girls are at a greater risk o f dying before the ages o f land 5 than boys, rcflecting better care for
boys. Correcting for this gender inequality in child-care would improve o\erall survival rates. One o f t h e most significant
positive effects, emerging consistently from various studies, i s a literate mother, reinforcing the utniost iniportance o f girls’
education. Household wealth also clearly matters, and so - and independently from wealth - do basic infrastructure serviccs
that help to keep the household and community environments clean. Different studies suggest strong links bctwccti reductions
in infant/child mortality and increased sanitation coverage, improved water supply and t l i e use o f cooking fucls and practices
that produce less sniolte. Given that acute respiratory illness, which i s associated \\#it11solid fuel sniolte by a scries o f studics,
and diarrhea, which i s linked to tlie lack o f sanitation and hygiene, are the t\$,o top “killers” o f children iiiider 5 in India, t h i s is
hardly surprising. Access to electricity has also been shown to correlate with reductions in infant and child morality in several
studies, although corroborating epidemiological evidence i s lacking. Substantial differences in the impact o f thcsc
infrastructure variables have been observed between urban and rural areas, as well as between better-off and poorcr states.

some o f the largest states that raise questions regarding data at the national level. I t appears that, at the
very least, the maternal mortality rate has not improved significantly. Other worrisome trends are an
accelerating rate o f infection by H I V / A I D S and deterioration in the overall sex ratio for children under
four. These trends have continued despite an increase in public expenditures o n health in the 1990s - and
partly because public expenditures o n health remain l o w by intemational standards.
Furthermore, the aggregate indicators mask widening divergence in GSDP per capita and other

indicators o f well being between the richer and poorer states. While poverty declined in both, the rate of

For example, Assain has the
highest percent o f population that i s calorie-deficient, reflecting extreme hunger poverty; Orissa, MI' and
UP have the highest infant and child mortality rates; and UP shows the lowest primary school enrollnient
rate. Access to reliable water supply and electricity, which i s important to both economic and human
development, i s also very uneven across states, as well as significantly lower in rural areas where the vast
majority o f India's poor live.

17.
Performance o n environmental issues, particularly related to environmental health, also reflects
some growing disparities. W h i l e urban air pollution in Delhi and other metro-cities has stabilized and/or
shown some decline - largely thanks to mounting pressure to act f r o m environmental activists and NGOs
representing the urban elite - efforts t o reduce indoor air pollution f r o m use o f traditional biomass fLiels
have suffered froin inconsistent policies and lack o f recognition o f the issue. For the poor, i t i s often t h i s
indoor air pollution that constitutes a larger risk to health, disproportionately affects women and young
children and contributes to high infant/child morality rates. In other areas o f environmental sustainability,
the story i s mixed. For instance, deforestation appears to have been reversed o n a national scale, which i s
a considerable achievement. At the same time consumption o f fuel w o o d has increased, suggesting
continued pressures o n forests. The worsening availability and quality o f water, particularly through
ground water depletion, has emerged as the major concern threatening livelihoods and development
prospects in many areas.
18
The issue o f whether India will be able to reach i t s MDG targets by 20 15 reinaiiis a focus o f
much research and debate. The recently completed Bank report "Attnmuzg tlze Mzl/ei?uzu/nDe\ e l o p o i /
Goals iiz India'I4 has focused o n the major human development-related MDGs (e.g , child and infant
mortality, child malnutrition, schooling enrollment and completion, gender disparities in schooling and
hunger poverty), disaggregated by sub-national units in India. In i t s analysis o f the progress and prospects
for achieving the MDGs at the state level, the report asserts that India cannot hope to attain the MDGs
without significant improvement in the poorest states, which will account for an even larger share o f the
country's population in 2015. The study concludes that achieving these goals w i l l be very challeiiging in
the poorest states - particularly for the goal o f 100 percent n e t primary enrollment and 100 percent
primary completion o f education. A useful illustration o f the increased rate o f progress that will be needed

Economic Developments and Outlook
India's ambitious program o f economic reforms, underway since 1991, can be credited for the
19.
overall good progress in increasing incomes and improving living standards. After the setback associated
with the 199 1 balance-of-payments crisis, economic growth, supported by wide-ranging reforms to open
and deregulate the economy, picked up significantly. Reforms included abolition o f all quantitative
restrictions o n non-consumer goods, reduction in tariffs, unification o f the exchange rates, adoption o f
more liberal rules for foreign direct investment, and the introduction o f current account convertibility.
Even though the pace o f reform has been uneven since the mid-l990s, cumulative changes so far
20.
have been substantial. M a n y sectors have opened up t o private activity, trade policy and the exchange rate
regime have been further liberalized, and the reform o f capital markets has started, leading to an improved
investment climate. Some positive reform developments have taken place recently: after several years o f
at best slow.decline, tariffs were significantly reduced in January 2004 - the average un-weighted tariff
was cut f r o m 33 percent to 22 percent; there are initial s i g n s o f fiscal adjustment at the Center and in
some states; and important reform legislation has been passed by b o t h central and several state
goveminents in recent years, including in the areas o f power sector reform: fiscal responsibility, and debt
recovery.
G r o w t h was rapid in the inid-1990s: the Eighth Plan Period (1992/93-1996/97) showed an annual
21.
average o f 6.7 percent growth. Overall growth then dropped during the N i n t h Plan Period (1 997198200 1/02) to 5.5 percent due to a significant slow-down in industrial growth. Growth slowed further in
2002103 t o an estimated 4 percent due in large part to the impact o f poor rains on agricultural output. B u t
2002/03 also saw the beginning o f an industrial recovery and increased investment in infrastructure.
Growth performance in 2003/04 was excellent, with an estimated growth rate o f around 8 percent
following a good monsoon and a rebound froin the 2002 drought, continued strong service sector
performance and further recovery in the industrial sector.

22.
However, the fiscal stance since the mid-1990s has not been conducive to long-run growth and
poverty reduction. The general govemment (Center and states) fiscal deficit has averaged around 10
percent in recent years. These high fiscal deficits have been accompanied by poor composition o f
expenditure with wages, pension, interest and subsidy crowding out capital spending and maintenance,
and leading to slow real growth in social sector spending.
23.
The fiscal deficits have also been largely financed by borrowings, w i t h a strategic s h i f t towards
long-term rupee debt after the 1991 crisis. General government debt rose f r o m 5 8 percent o f G D P at endM a r c h 1986 to 85 percent o f GDP by end-March 2003. Including the debt o f public enterprises, total
public debt i s n o w 95 .percent o f GDP, with contingent liabilities f r o m loss-making public enterprises
adding another 12 percent o f GDP. Despite the apparent ease w i t h which the fiscal deficit i s being
financed, a large part o f household savings i s being used to finance the gap between public sector
investment and savings. However, the r i s k o f crisis in India today i s mitigated by public control o f m u c h
o f the banking sector, as well as by the strong extemal position. Rising external reserves and low l e v e l s
o f short-term extemal debt give the country a very comfortable cushion to counter any speculative attack.
The risk i s further reduced by limited capital account convertibility, and a flexible exchange rate.
24.
Moreover, at the Center, there are early s i g n s that the fiscal and revenue deficits may be falling
below their peak o f 200 1/02, and that central debt i s stabilizing. Preliminary estimates indicate a Central
Govemment fiscal deficit o f 4.8 percent o f GDP for 2003/04 - significantly lower than the budgeted
number o f 5.6 percent o f GDP. The passage o f the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act,
which mandates elimination o f the current account deficit o f the central govemiiient by M a r c h 3 1, 2008,
i s also an encouraging development. Nevertheless, further efforts will be needed to address fiscal
imbalances at the Center and especially in the states, which account for about 40 percent o f the general
government fiscal deficit, where, while some states have made good progress, there i s so far l i t t l e by way
o f aggregate fiscal adjustment. The l o w interest rate regime observed today may also not remain forever
and as l o n g as debt remains high the sustainability o f the fiscal stance i s extremely vulnerable to an
increase in interest rates. M a j o r fiscal reforms are needed to reduce central and state fiscal deficits, to
reorient public spending towards public investment and non-wage operations and maintenance, to
improve the quality and efficiency o f government spending, and to increase revenue iiiobilization
(simplifyingtax structures, eliminating exemptions, bringing services into the tax net, implementing a

VAT).

25.
Medium-term prospects for growth depend critically on the pace o f structural reform as w e l l as
fiscal consolidation. An aggressive reform effort by the govemnient will be required to encourage the
private investment needed to achieve higher sustained growth. Key areas for growth promoting structural
r e f o r m are the power sector, agriculture and factor markets, especially labor and land (for details o n the
required reforms, see the discussion o f GoI’s poverty reduction strategy in the next section)
The DPR developed t w o growth scenarios: a slow reform sceizurzo in w h i c h growth would slow
26.
to 5 percent, and afast reform sceizano in w h i c h growth would progressively accelerate to S percent’.
Currently, India appears to be in between these t w o scenarios. Medium-temi growth prospects have
definitely improved over the last year with faster industrial and services growth already in evidence. and
with considerable reform progress in the last year or so. While India i s currently o n an underlying growth
path o f around 6 percent, i t i s clearly possible for Go1 and the states to set growth o n a highei path and
achieve 8 percent in the coining years, provided reforms are further broadened and accelerated

THE TENTH PLAN - INDIA’S POVERTY REDCC
STRATEGY

27.
These economic and social developments provide the challenging context for implenientation o f
the Government’s poverty reduction strategy, embodied in India’s Tenth Five-Year Plan. The Tenth Plan
covers 200213 to 200617 and was prepared over a two-year period involving an extensive process o f
consultation and consensus building. I t lays out even more ambitious goals than the MDGs and
acknowledges that a higher level o f performance will require some radical departures f r o m existing
practices in India.
28.

The essence o f the Tenth Plan i s to change the role and improve the effectiveness o f government,
so as to better support the private sector and ensure widespread improvements in well-being. The strategy
has four core components. First, govemance and service delivery are t o be improved. Greater reliance i s
to be placed on the private sector and o n public sector reforms to deliver accountability, reduce
opportunities for corruption and improve the speed and effectiveness o f government at all levels. Second,
poverty i s to be reduced, particularly in the lagging states, through the implenientation o f policies that
encourage growth, employment generation and access to elementary education (especially for girls) and
to primary health care (especially for women). Third, the growth rate i s to be increased, including through
greater public investments. As outlined in the Tenth Plan, this requires fiscal adjustment at both the
central and state levels, as well as reform o f the financial system, and trade liberalization. Finally,
improvements in infrastructure and the productive base are at the heart o f the Tenth Plan.
The Tenth Plan targets an average growth rate o f 8 percent per year and rapid progress across a
29.
wide range o f social indicators, spurred by an ambitious policy reform agenda. As mentioned in
paragraph 26 above, while currently the likely medium term outlook for growth i s about 6 percent a yeai.
i t i s clearly possible for Go1 and the states to set growth o n a higher path and move towards the Tenth
Plan growth target o f 8 percent a year by the end o f the Plan period (tlzefast refu7w s c e / i m o ) provided
comprehensive reforms are adopted.

In afast reform sce7?ario, measures to reduce fiscal deficits, at the Center and in the states, would
30.
reduce crowding out and pressures for exchange rate appreciation, and create space for increased private
investment. Improvements in the management and composition o f public expenditures, with a lower
share spent on c i v i l servants’ wages, pensions and interest, and o n covering power sector losses, and a
higher share spent o n operations and maintenance (O&M) and investments in k e y infrastructure, would
further “crowd in” private investment. Improvements in the investment climate, through the reinoval o f
bottlenecks in product and factor markets and key infrastructure, w o u l d increase the productivity o f both
public and private investment across the economy, including in India’s poor rural areas. An increase i n
FDI would contribute technology transfer and increase output.
Accelerating growth towards 8 percent a year also depends greatly o n changes taking place in
3 1,
India’s lagging states. I f the trends o f the past few years continue, Le., if growth continues to be divergent
across states (with poorer states growing n o faster than 5 percent per year or only slightly better than in
1997-2002), then richer states would have to grow at near 10 percent per year o n average to reach a n allIndia average o f 6.5 percent per year over the Tenth Plan period. Since this i s unlikely, implicit in
projections o f rapid aggregate growth i s an acceleration o f growth in the lagging states. To achieve this,
major policy and governance reforms w i l l be needed in the poorer states. The role o f the Center in both
catalyzing and setting the pace for reforms at the state l e v e l will be critical.

8

Since poverty i s also primarily a rural phenomenon in India, policies to increase the productivity
32.
o f agriculture, which declined between the 1980s and 1990s, will also be o f particular importance for
poverty reduction and increased rural incomes. In the short run, the removal o f subsidies to food grains
could reduce agricultural output in the few states that benefit the most from these subsidies. In the
medium term, these are also states where significant agricultural diversification can take place. M o r e
importantly, this reform agenda would help increase incomes in poor states that do not benefit f r o m
subsidies, and release resources for rural infrastructure, such as research and extension, rural
electrification, and rural roads - k e y inputs to achieving faster progress on the MDGs. Simultaneously,
faster growth in industry and continued rapid growth in services could provide jobs for the labor force
released f r o m agriculture.
33.
I t i s also important to note that a number o f factors weaken the link between India’s economic
growth and poverty reduction. These factors range from the skewed ownership of, and access to,
productive assets (e.g., land, credit) and ineffective delivery o f government programs, to restrictive social
groupings that cause exclusion (e.g., caste, kinship) and systems o f patronage. In India, social processes
can s t i l l w o r k to exclude, deprive or discriminate against large population groups o n the basis o f their
caste, ethnicity, religion and gender. Bias against women compounds other types o f exclusion. The
groups excluded, the way they are affected and the effectiveness o f policies against exclusion varies
significantly between urban-rural areas and regions. In general however, all these forms o f exclusion
block mobility and reduce opportunities for involvement in economic and political l i f e . None are
conducive to achieving the targets set out in the MDGs. Measures aimed at empowering poor people,
both as economic agents and as service users, therefore appear to be vital for success in sustained poverty
reduction.

As highlighted in the 2004 W o r l d Development Report (2004 WDR), ‘‘Making Services Workfor
34.
Poor People ”, more effective delivery o f health and education services and provision o f social safety
nets, w o u l d help to empower India’s citizens to both contribute to, and benefit from, strong economic
growth. Effective service delivery will in turn depend o n measures that increase the accountability o f the
public sector and private service providers to all Indian citizens, including the poorest and most
vulnerable. This suggests a need for greater progress on shifting the role o f government, decentralizing
services and strengthening local government capacity across India, in order to tighten the linkages
between politicians, service providers and poor citizens. The most vulnerable segments o f the population
- namely women and girls and the SC/STs - cannot be left out o f this equation.
35.
In summary, thefast refoim scenario will need to be comprehensive, not j u s t to accelerate
growth, but also to rapidly improve social indicators, during and beyond the Tenth Plan period. Some o f
the most important elements o f the r e f o m i agenda that w o u l d comprise the fast reform scenario - most o f
which are embodied in the Tenth Plan, are outlined in B o x 2.

Fiscal Policy

Box 2: Summary o f India’s Priority Reforms

Progressively reduce the primary deficit at the Center and in states by completing tax reforms (eliminating exemptions.
bringing services into the tax net, implementing a uniform state V A T and reforming tax administration), reducing
power sector losses, and phasing out petroleum subsidies.
Reduce financial sector risks by implementing the new securitization law, linking returns on provident funds and small
savings to market benchmarks, and establishing a clear frameworlt for managing statc governnient guarantees.
Improve fiscal management by imposing greater fiscal discipline on state borrowing and transfers, breaking down
artificial distinction between plan and non-plan expenditures, and consolidating Centrally Sponsored Schemes.
Improve the composition o f public expenditures, b y reducing the share spent on wages, pensions, interest payments,
and agricultural subsidies, and increasing investment and O&M for priority social; InfrastrtictLire and agriculture
programs.

I

Delivery o f Public Services
Reduce administrative fragmentation and reform civil service pay policy and pensions. Improve thc performance o f thc
civil service and quality o f service delivery by improving public access to information, strengthening accountability,
and reducing political interference.
Refocus health, education and social safety net programs on outcomes. The central government can play an important
role as an independent source for measuring progress towards agreed goals.
Improve the private market for health care through training, public information and accreditation. Priorities for public
funds are to provide clean water and sanitation, and to combat communicable diseases (including HIVIAIDS
prevention).
Ensure increased public resources and improved resource use i n elementary education. Schools should be more
accountable to communities, with more local autonomy to find the best solutions.
Develop a well-designed fiscal framework for local governments, which would guarantee their autonomy and
accountability. Flows o f funds from the Center and states should be dependent on good local fiscal perforniance and
resource mobilization.
Investment Climate for Industry and Services
Speed up trade reform by reducing average import tariffs and phase out tariff exemptions, specific tariffs and antidumping duties. Remove other product market distortions by, implementing a full and uniforni VAT, phasing out
remaining FDI restrictions, eliminating preferential policies for small-scale firms, price and marlteting reforms for
agricultural and agro-based products, and streamlining business entry and regulation procedures.
Reduce inefficiencies in factor markets by easing restrictions on hiring and firing o f workers, enhance the capacity o f
the financial system to mobilize longer-term resources and allocate finance more efficiently towards productive sectors,
thereby enhancing access b y underserved segments (SMEs, micro enterprises, infrastructure), address problcms in the
use and transfer o f land, and enhance bankruptcy procedures.
Ensure access to reliable power at reasonable costs b y rationalizing power tariffs and improving the financial and
operational performance o f State Electricity Boards.
Address capacity and quality constraints in the transport sector b y improving public sector performance (for roads and
rail), mobilizing private sector investment (including better cost recovery for roads), phasing out price distortions (for
rail), and improving the efficiency o f existing capacity (for ports).
Agricultural Policy and R u r a l Development
Put in place a market-based food grain policy that protects the poor through targeted safety nets, while mitigating
drastic supply shocks through a cost effective and well-managed price stabilization mechanism
Reduce input subsidies that are fiscally unsustainable and distorting input use. Savings should be used to fund more
productive investments in agricultural research and extension, rural roads, and rural electrification.
Reduce regulation o f domestic trading activities for major agricultural coniniodities and eliminate rcmaining trade
policy distortions, including subsidized exports o f rice and wheat.
Improve access to land by revisiting current legislation on land tenancy, and building oil successftil initiati\,es to
improve land administration.
Devise market-based solutions to improve rural access to a larger range o f financial services, at lower cost.

THE INDIA AND WORLD BAN

Reviewing Our Assistance
36.
Given the vast development challenges, and the modest size o f Bank Group programs relative to
the population and economy o f India, the Bank Group cannot support India in every effort toward
achieving i t s Tenth Plan goals and the MDGs. Instead, since 1997 B a n k Group strategy has been to
engage selectively in India and primarily at the state level, with knowledge resources and financing
geared towards reform. The m a i n thrust o f the strategy has been to support the programs o f leading
reform states in order to create demonstration effects that might stimulate reforms across other states. or

I

in other sectors o f a reforming state. The focus o f I F C activity has been on investments in
manufacturing, financial services and infrastructure.

37.

In developing this CAS, the Bank Group country team undertook a self-assessment o f i t s FY02-

F Y 0 4 support to India t o supplement the C A S Progress Report o f December 2002. A note on this review
i s attached as Annex 2. The assessment concludes that, by focusing o n key aspects o f the reforin agenda
and working in partnership with GoI, reforming states and others, the Bank Group has been able to have
considerable positive impact. Recent Bank Group programs have been ambitious in their efforts to
catalyze and expand the state reform process in areas that are central to reducing poverty in India - and
when progress in reforms was slower than expected, Bank strategy was also w e l l structured to deal w i t h
the slowdown in reform implementation that took place in several states. W h i l e concluding that the
FY02-04 strategy was broadly appropriate, the review points to some lessons o f experience which suggest
an evolution (rather than a fundamental rethink) o f the strategy going forward. These include: the need to
address growing disparities in state development performance, especially given the importance o f the
poorest states for achievement o f the MDGs; the importance o f long-term engagement with states on
cross-cutting reform issues; and the disadvantages o f concentrating investment lending in states that are
recipients o f adjustment lending. Further detail o n implementation o f the FY02-04 CAS i s provided in
the note and a brief summary o f progress for some o f the m a i n product lines o f the Bank follows below.

38.
F o r the Bank’s oizgoirzgportjiolio, India’s portfolio perfonnance declined in FY03 after five years
o f sustained improvement in most quality indicators, and showed m i x e d results in F Y 0 4 after a number o f
improvement actions were taken o n projects that were either slow disbursing or closing w i t h large
undisbursed balances. These actions resulted in an improvement in disbursement performance, but also in
an increase in the riskiness rating o f the portfolio. The disbursement ratio reached 19.9 percent at endFY04, which i s slightly below the Bank average o f 21.4 percent and ratios for other large Borrowers such
as China (22 percent) and Indonesia (27.2 percent). The percentage o f projects-at-risk increased to 16
percent in F Y 0 4 compared to 11 percent in F Y 0 3 and the Bank-wide average o f 16 percent. M a n y o f
these projects had clearly not been ready for implementation at approval, and hence suffered one or two
years at the outset in which little was disbursed. At current implementation and disbursement rates, none
o f the ongoing projects in the portfolio can be completed within the 5-year implementation period which
has been the business standard for Bank projects in the South Asia region.
39.
The causes o f slow disbursement included a weakening o f project readiness for implenientation
and a weakening o f follow-up and proactive actions to address slow disbursing projects. The increase in
the portfolio riskiness rating results f r o m more candid reporting and proactive portfolio management,
which i s reflected in the end-FYO4 realism and proactivity indices o f 90 percent and 83 percent,
respectively. In order to improve portfolio performance and support the strategy for scaling up Bank
support to India, the B a n k and Go1 engaged in intensive dialogue during F Y 0 4 o n ways to improve the
portfolio and agreed o n a Portfolio Improvement Strategy. Iinplementatioii o f this strategy (attached as
Annex 8) began in mid-FY04 and i s expected to continue into F Y 0 5 and beyond.
40.
F o r new Bank lending, commitments fell short o f the base case o f the CAS during FY03 and
F Y 0 4 and below the program envisioned at the time o f the Progress Report. Reasons for t h i s include
delays in both adjustment and investment lending due to a slower than expected pace o f reform
implementation in some states. Consistent with the ‘self-activating triggers‘ o f the FY02-04 CAS: t h e
Bank’s lending volumes have been reduced when states have slowed in t h e i r implementation o f fiscal,
goiw-name and power reforms. The investment pipeline was also affected by preparation delays.
Despite this, IDA resources, w h i c h are constrained at l o w levels relative to India‘s size and absorptive
capacity, are likely to be fully utilized during IDA-13.

By contrast, while the slowdown in some state reforms reduced Bank financing, dui-ing FY03 and
F Y 0 4 the AAA progrniiz o f the Bank was stepped up. The country team continued a dialogue on reforms
and provided non-lending technical assistance in UP when further adjustment lending was put on hold as
the state’s reform process faltered. Substantial policy advice and non-lending technical assistance have
also been provided in states where adjustment lending has been under preparation, namely AP, Kamatalta.
T a m i l N a d u and Orissa. Important analytic w o r k o n the investment climate and fiscal, governance and
power sector reform was also initiated in states where the B a n k had not previously been engaged in these
areas, including Maharashtra, Bihar and Punjab.
In addition to the expansion o f state level policy dialogue and non-lending TA, the country team
42.
focused on major studies such as the D P R and an AP Growth Study in order to disseminate key messages
more widely across India. A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR). several State Financial
Accountability Assessments (SFAAs) and numerous sectoral policy notes, workshops and dissemination
activities were also delivered to bolster the reform process at both the federal and state l e v e l s

F o r IFCprograms, cominitments in India grew strongly over the C A S period, albeit with
considerable variation in response to changing market and regulatory conditions. Over the last two years
IFC achieved record comniitments in India, nearly doubling i t s portfolio, improving profitability and
investing in high impact projects, making India IFC’s second largest exposure. In FY03, I F C committed
a record US$348 m i l l i o n and in F Y 0 4 commitments were USS290 million, with a concentration in
iiiaiiufacturing, as well as investments in agribusiness, power, o i l and gas, finance and healthcare. The
expansion was mainly in long-tenn debt, aided by the introduction (in FY02) o f local currency lending,
which i s better suited to sectors such as infrastructure, housing finance and healthcare that do not generate
foreign exchange.

Scaling Up
44.
The country team’s review o f Bank Group assistance (paragraph 37) reconfirmed the positive
impact that the Bank Group can have when focusing o n supporting key aspects o f the reforiii agenda and
working in partnership with GoI, the states and others. The B a n k Group offers a number o f strengths.
First among these i s the Bank Group’s ability to gather and share global knowledge and experiences w i t h
Go1 and other important audiences in India. Secondly, the B a n k Group has a broad array o f tools that it
can offer to help mobilize private financing and foster greater private sector participation in India’s
development. Thirdly, through lending and investments, the B a n k Group can help catalyze greater
effectiveness and more efficient spending o f others (e.g., state level governments), towards the ultimate
goal o f reducing poverty and encouraging India’s sustainable development. I n lookiizg nlzend, tlie core
inessage of this CAS is to build on these strengths while engaging in new ways with Indin to nclrieve n
iiiqjor step-up in Bank Group impact mid delivery
45.
work:

T o achieve t h i s enhanced impact, three Strategic Principles will underpin the B a n k G r o ~ i ’ps

Focusing on outcomes, to ensure that all o f the w o r k o f the Bank Group IS explicitly geared tobbards
supporting India’s achievement o f i t s development goals. Annex 4 provides a CAS Outcoines ,\/Iatrix
for FY05-08. The Bank Group will support achievement o f these outcoines with all o f i t s financc
and knowledge resources in India; the outcomes will in turn serve as tlie goal posts to ineasure the
effectiveness o f Bank Group support over the medium t e r m tiiiiefraine o f tlie assistance strategq
During FY05-08 the Bank Group will also seek to support or develop a stronger focus o n results and
an ‘outcomes orientation’ within the programs o f Go1 and the states, emphasizing impact monitoring

12

and evaluation and improved service delivery for some o f the most far-reaching programs o f
government.
Due to the complexity o f India’s development challenges, Bank Group programs will necessarily
span a wide range o f sectors and types o f interventions. Nevertheless, selectivity will b e applied, to
target limited resources to activities where assistance i s welcomed and where contributions can also
be the most effective. An important element o f this i s working closely with the major donor and
financing partners remaining in India, (paragraphs 62-66) taking their programs into account and
seeking to w o r k together for co-financing o f country-led programs under cominon fiduciary and
safeguard arrangements. Lending selectivity will also be exercised by choosing projects in a way that
seeks to maximize their impact. During FYOS-08, this means focusing adjustment lending on states
undertaking comprehensive reforms, as i s currently the case, and applying ’guidelines for
engagement’ for investment lending (paragraph 60). Even with scaled-up lending, gross
disbursements w i l l be very small in relation to the size o f India’s economy - l e s s than 0.2 percent o f
GDP. Selectivity therefore also means a greater emphasis on projects that either pilotldemonstrate
new approaches for possible scaling up later, projects that move f r o m successful pilots to larger scale
interventions, and projects that support expansion o f proven government programs o n a sector-wide
basis.
0

The Bank will also a i m to substantially expand i t s role as a politically realistic knowledge provider
and generator. T o achieve this shift, changes are envisioned o n a number o f fronts, including: (i)
strengthening Bank capacity to act as a channel for ideas and lessons o f international experience
(paragraphs 173- 179); (iij placing greater emphasis on understanding the motivations o f interest
groups and different stakeholders in the reform process; (iiij helping clients to better coniniuiiicate the
potential benefits o f their reform p r o g r a m ; and (iv) operating in a inore strategic and integrated
fashion across different organizational units o f the Bank to leverage knowledge resources inore
effectively. Given the modest scale o f B a n k Group financing, to help realize i t s role as a full
development partner, an important part o f i t s knowledge function will be directed to supporting better
delivery and effectiveness o f government programs, with the a i m o f leveraging rather small
knowledge-based interventions into significant impacts on development outcomes.

Applying these Stmtegic Prirzciyles, the Bank will seek n siibstaittial increase in its volunie of
46.
leizdiizg to India. Given India’s enormous needs, the expansion will primarily be in (i)infrastructure
(roads, transport, power, water supply and sanitation, irrigation and urban developiiient - to undei-pinboth
accelerated growth and improved service delivery); (ii)
human development (education, health, social
protection - priorities to support specific MDGs); and (iii)
rural livelihoods (with an emphasis on
community-driven approaches). Cross-cutting reforms at the state level will also remain an important
focus. Expansion in lending for human development and rural livelihoods will depend critically on
availability o f IDA resources, whose expansion would be justified by the opportunity to contribute to
achieving the MDGs.

The stepped up program will provide increased opportunity for collaboration across the Bank
47.
Group to promote innovative Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure de\,elopnient particularly in power and transport. The Private Sector Development Strategy (attached as Annex 7 )
suggests some areas where this collaboration might be developed. The basic principle guiding t h e
division o f labor i s for the Bank to support activities that warrant public support, while IFC and MIGA
assistance will encompass activities that fall within the private sector‘s role.
IFC will continue to provide equity and loan financing and guarantees to supplement n h a t i s
available f r o m Indian financial institutions or capital markets, and will help to mobilize financing from

48.

13

both domestic and international sources. This will include pioneering investments in infrastructure \\here
innovative structures and long tenors are required; and investments i n projects which are constrained by
limited risk appetite o f other investors, including medium-sized manufacturing companies. agribusiness
companies and companies entering new markets domestically and internationally. IFC w i l I add value to
the projects it invests in by mobilizing finance f r o m other sources (especially foreign investment),
advising o n structuring, acting as an honest broker between various project parties and facilitating
international partnership, particularly with other developing countries.

49.

In i t s lending and investments, the Bank Group will focus 011adding value through advice on
environmental and social sustainability, public and corporate governance and the transfer o f global
knowledge and best practices. I n doing so, IFC will promote higher corporate standards o f social and
en\ ironmental responsibility and the Bank will w o r k to improve iiiiplementation o f environmental and
social frameworks and strengthen the national and state-level frameworks f o r procurement and financial
management. This will be reinforced by efforts t o change the way that the B a n k does business in India seeking to harinonize B a n k safeguard and fiduciary requirements, as w e l l as those o f other donors, as far
as i s possible around the policies adopted by Go1 and state governments ( B o x 3). This harmonization
with goveriiinent systems will be inanaged carefully, focusing during the CAS period o n sectors in which
i t s benefits are clearly greater than risks (Le., large numbers o f small, relatively l o w risk investments as i n
education, reproductive and c h i l d health, rural water and rural roads). Additionally, Country Financing
Parameters, which will allow increased flexibility in the type o f expenditures that are eligible for Bank
financing in India, are also being developed. W h i l e the n e w financing parameters are not like14 to lead to
a significant change i n demand for Bank financing, they can simplify procedures and reduce the
transaction costs o f B a n k finance for GoI.
Box 3: Supporting Improved Fiduciary and Safeguard Systems
The Bank i s seeking new opportunities to strengthen and, where possible, use Indian government systems to
satisfy its fiduciary and safeguard requirements - and in the process seeking to change the way that it does
business in India. One way i t w i l l do so i s by working closely with other development partners for co-financing
o f country-led programs under common fiduciary and safeguard arrangements. A sector-\\ ide approach i s also
one o f the vehicles for implementing this new business strategy (see Box 4).
For the Bank and other development agencies to place reliance on government systems, they need to have a
detailed understanding o f their design and operational performance. With respect tofidziciayy reqztirements, the
Bank uses standard tools for assessing these systems and determining the level o f fiduciary risk - Country/State
Financial Accountability Assessinelits and Country/State Procurement Assessment Reviews. Where weaknesses
in design or performance are identified, this need not preclude use o f government systems, provided that
appropriate steps are taken to mitigate the risks and strengthen capacity in the medium term. The Bank will
continue analytical work and intensify its technical support for governments’ efforts to strengthen financial
management and procurement practices i n the public sector. With respect to safeguard requirements. the new
approach would also require an early integration o f social and environmental considerations into prqject
preparation in line with Bank policy. This would be based on an assessment by the Bank o f the effectiveness o f
existing practices and procedures in the sector and the sector’s capacity to implement and monitor solutions.
From this assessment, the Bank and client teams then work to build into project design any specific measures
needed to manage unresolved risks. As agreements on management o f environmental and social risks are
reached, the dialogue can increasingly shift to improving implementation performance and accountability for
results. This basic approach could be adapted to other sectors where the safeguard risks are considered to be low.

50.
In order to also scale up the impact o f the B a n k Group’s global k n o w l e d g e resources in India.
the AAA program i s being reshaped to focus on (i)preparation and dissemination o f a limited number o f
major reports on key issues in India’s development, either required for fiduciary reasons. or focused on
14

topics on which a public exposition o f Bank views would be helpful to advancing the development debate
(Annex B4); and (ii)‘just-in-time’ activities (including reports, policy dialogue, worltshops, etc.)
primarily in response to Go1 requests. The Bank Group will seek an increasing array o f partnerships with
local research institutions and interested organizations in both developing i t s analytic w o r k and
disseminating important findings. An enhanced program o f support f r o m WBI will be an integral part o f
the reshaped AAA program, with WBI focusing o n five o f the areas where capacity-building efforts can
be most beneficial. These five thematic areas - H I V / A I D S control, urban development, local
government capacity building, improving the investment climate and strengthening fiscal management will guide WBI support, along with a particular focus o n four o f the poorest states with the greatest
capacity building needs (paragraphs 56-57).
Since India has underutilized trust fund and grant programs offered through tlie Bank Group in
5 1.
the past, at the request o f GoI, greater effort will be made to enhance participation with these programs i n
the coming strategy period. In particular, Go1 and the B a n k will seek to help strengthen project readiness
via upfront analytical w o r k and strengthen implementation capacity or the capacity o f key institutions
(e.g., through Japan Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) and Institutional De\relopment
Fund (IDF) grants).

Working at the National Level
Scaling up will require expanded Bank support at the national level. A large part o f this
52.
expansion will be in the f o r m o f A A A : for instance the series o f major reports will primarily address
issues o f national consequence, Some o f these issues are expected to be: the Implications o f India’s
Gender Imbalance, Employment Issues (especially for young people), the Long-term Economic Impacts
o f H I V / A I D S , Building India’s Knowledge Economy, India’s Adaptation to Climate Change and a review
o f Disability Issues and Impacts. A full listing o f the proposed program for FY05-FY06 i s attached in
Annex B4; the midterni review o f the C A S will address the program anticipated for the latter h a l f o f tlie
strategy period. With the recent D P R serving as a model, the Bank will w o r k to bring a multi-sectoral
perspective to these studies and seek broad dissemination o f their messages across India.
The increase in overall lending will also involve more national l e v e l lending (for roads: power,
53.
education, H I V / A I D S , etc.) Compared to recent years. An important shift envisioned for FY05-08 i s the
use o f new approaches, including co-financing with other development partners under coiiinioii
arrangements, for national programs in the areas most critical to meeting the MDGs. Using s u c h
approaches, the Bank will seek to step up i t s national level engagement and w o r k closely w i t h partners
that can j o i n the Bank in providing substantial assistance. Such operations are already beginning to
materialize, with the first being a major new sector-wide approach (Swap) supporting GoI’s national
elementary education program - Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) - approved by the Board i n April 2004.
As highlighted in B o x 4, Operations such as this can be expected to pave t l i e way for a stronger and inore
effective partnership between the Bank and Go1 into the future.

Box 4: Leveraging Bank Support through SWAps

SWAps offer the possibility o f an enhanced inipact o f B a n k lending, a strengthened focus o n monitoring outcomes
in key sectors and an effective vehicle to help strengthen fiduciary and safeguard capacity. Go1 and the Bank
recently agreed to initiate experiences w i t h t h i s approach through a first S W A P in support o f India‘s national
elementary education program (SSA). SSA i s designed for a large federal system, with a decentralized framework
for service delivery and a built-in accountability mechanism at the school and community levels. IDA, the EC and
DFID are pooling their funds with Go1 to support the program. The SWAP mechanism will enable the external
partners to w o r k towards improving institutional capacity in the course o f program implementation. SSA has a
results-based framework through i t s funding arrangements, rewarding implementation at the districtlsub-district
levels. External contributions are designed t o maximize central-level support, w h i c h in turn i s designed to
leverage state-level support - a l l with the goal that development assistance complements, rather than substitutes
for, local efforts.
F o l l o w i n g f r o m the experience o f SSA, a S W A P to support the national Repioductive and Child H e a l t h (RCH)
program i s also under preparation This second RCH project for the B a n k w o u l d facilitate pooling o f b o t h Bank
and DFID funds and a stronger performance orientation towards the program’s k e y objectives
Based o n the implementation experience o f these operations and lessons learned, Go1 and the Bank could explore
the possibility o f using S W A p s in other sectors and in states having the right conditions for such wider
engagement.

Working with the States
54.

Some important shifts are also being implemented in the Bank Group approach to the states.
Since 1997, the C A S has included a focus o n states undertaking comprehensive refomis, in order to
support the leaders o f change and serve as a catalyst to the state-level r e f o m i process. With the widening
gulf between the reforming and non-reforming states in India, leading t o a concentration o f poverty and
poor social indicators in just a few states, some shifts in this approach are warranted. Though the Barik
Group strategy will retain an essentially reform aiidperforiiiaizce-based approach to t h e states, it will
also cltange in ways that are intended to go as far as possible in opening up new opportirriities.for
engagenzeiit with these largest and poorest states.

55.

A number o f steps are envisaged. First, in consultation with GoI, the Bank i s seeking in this
C A S to ensure that a l l o f the largest and poorest states o f India that so wish are engaged in a dialogue o n
cross-cutting reforms that are the focus o f adjustment lending (fiscal management, governance, service
delivery, the p o w e r sector and the investment climate), regardless o f their eligibility f o r adjustment
lending. Either the Bank or ADB w o u l d take the lead in offering support through dialogue o n crosscutting reforms in each o f the major states. Twelve o f India’s 28 states - AP, Assam, Bihar, Jharldiand,
Kamatalta, M P , Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, T a m i l Nadu, UP and West Bengal - account for over 90
percent o f India’s poor. The B a n k i s currently actively engaged in dialogue with Karnataka: Orissa (in
collaboration with DFID), AP (in collaboration with DFID), UP and T a m i l N a d u and would seek a
similar dialogue with Bihar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Jharkhand. ADB i s engaged in dialogue with
M P (in collaboration with DFID) and Assam. ADB has also had a longstanding engagement with West
Bengal.
Secondly, the B a n k will work proactively to try to build a productive development relationship
w i t h four states where poverty i s increasingly concentrated in India and where public institutions are
considered to be at their weakest - Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and UP. This support could go beyond rile
basic dialogue o n cross-cutting reforms noted above.

56.

16

The expanded support to these four states could take several forms during the strategy period. The
57.
Bank w o u l d seek to mobilize limited grant funding resources (e.g., f r o m the IDF or Japan Social
Development Fund (JSDF)) to finance innovative governmental and non-governmental activity targeted
to poverty reduction and progress towards the MDGs. A good example o f this kind o f work i s the recent
approval o f a JSDF seed grant for the Orissa Fund for Development Initiatives. The Bank would also
w o r k to help these states meet ‘guidelines for engagement’ for investment lending (paragraph 54) in
support o f critical poverty-focused projects. At this time the most promising candidates are the IDAfinanced projects that rely on community driven approaches to improve rural livelihoods, watershed
management and/or rural water supply and sanitation. The country program and WBI will also seek
avenues for focused knowledge support and capacity building in these states, taking into account
experiences in non-lending TA within the India program (e.g., ongoing w o r k in UP) and the learning
gained elsewhere (e.g., programs designed for ‘ l o w income countries under stress’).

58.
Thirdly, state-level adjustment lending operations (SALs), aimed at supporting achievement o f
the MDGs, are also expected to remain an important part o f the B a n k program - up to 15 percent o f total
lending. W h i l e in the initial phase such lending was limited to three states (UP, AF’ and Karnataka), Go1
has adopted guidelines for untied official external financing o f state budgets which provide transparent
criteria for such support and have opened the way for additional states to receive s u c h funding on a
performance basis. In addition to supporting state government efforts to reduce fiscal deficits, reform the
power sector, strengthen governance and implement a range o f actions to improve the investment climate
- all o f which have been covered by the initial state S A L s - this lending would support cross-cutting
actions to improve service delivery. Any such lending would be preceded by in-depth analytic work; and
the Bank would provide technical assistance to help states as they implement their Comprehensive reform
programs.
59.
GoI’s guidelines for state adjustment lending will be the subject o f ongoing discussion between
Go1 and the Bank to adapt to evolving circumstances, However, the most recent guidelines emphasize
that external support be designed so that:
any state that i s considered to be implementing a comprehensive reforin effort would be eligible for
adjustment lending. Similarly, any previously reforming state that discontiiiues comprehensive
reform implementation would n o longer be eligible for adjustment lending for as long as i t remains
o f f track;
adjustment lending to the states would be set in a medium-termframework o f about f i v e years,
consisting o f a medium-tenn r e f o n n program and associated external financing;
progressive deficit reduction, power sector reform, improved governance, the investment climate and
improved service delivery w o u l d be elements o f all programs, with the basic design principle being to
focus o n k e y actions within the state’s control that would promote poverty reduction most effectively;
and
extemal financing w o u l d not be an addition to overall financing for a state (since i t would be in the
context o f declining state budget deficits) and i s therefore to be seen as refinancing or substituting for
higher-cost debt. In this context, states with both serious debt sustainability i s s u e s and solid reform
programs would be the best candidates for adjustment lending. As in the case o f investment lending
(paragraph 61), on-lending t e r m s for adjustment lending w o u l d be kept under review, bearing in mind
their basic role as an incentive for reform implementation.

60.
Fourthly, there i s n o longer an upfront decision to concentrate substantial state-level investment
lending o n ‘focus states’ that are also receiving adjustment lending in support o f cross-cutting reforms.
17

Instead, investment lending will be channeled more broadly to states that are able to comply with n e w
‘guidelines for engagement’ for the relevant sector. These guidelines attempt to set out the sector-specific
conditions that experience has shown to be necessary for project success. Annex 5 suiiiiiiai-izes the
guidelines for both Center and state level investment lending broadly agreed with GoI. They would be
amended as necessary during the C A S period in light o f evolving experience. Given the small size o f
Bank resources relative to the vast needs across India’s states - and the prospect that more states will take
up sector reforms during the period - i t i s likely that demand for Bank support could outstrip i t s capacity
to respond at the same time within a sector. Where this i s the case, the Bank would engage first with the
states with the greatest number o f poor citizens, or weakest indicators, in order to maximize i t s impact.
Annex 6 provides the status o f MDG indicators by state and some background as to h o w these choices
would be made.

The Fiscal Context for Investment Lending
An important concern for investment lending will be to ensure that i t i s consistent w i t h the GoI’s
61.
goal o f progressive fiscal adjustment, both at the Center and state levels. Accordingly:
the framework for lending for which Go1 i s the beneficiary i s provided by the M e d i u m Tei-in Fiscal
Framework recently adopted by GoI;

investment lending for which public sector undertakings (PSUs) are the beneficiary w o u l d be based
o n the creditworthiness o f the PSU concerned. Discussions are underway with Go1 to determine onlending t e r m s in such cases, which could range f r o m budget transfers for non-revenue generating
activities (e.g., r a i l safety or non-revenue generating roads) to a full pass through o f IBRD terms for
commercial activities (e.g., power generation or transmission); and
investment lending for which a state or states would be the beneficiary would only t a k e place wth1n
the context o f a M e d i u i i i T e r m Fiscal Reform Program (MTFRP) agreed between the state and Go1
The on-lending ternis for B a n l d I D A investment lending to states \vi11 be kept under review.

Working With External Partners
62.
The context for development assistance to India has changed during the last year. In September
2003, Go1 announced new guidelines for development cooperation with bilateral partners. As per the new
guidelines, India will receive direct bilateral assistance only f r o m Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany,
the United States o f America, the European Commission and the Russian Federation. All other bilateral
assistance would be routed either through multilateral organizations or for projects o f econoiiiic and social
importance directly to universities, NGOs or autonomous bodies registered under the Foreign
Contribution (Regulation) Act.
63.
The work o f the Bank Group has been coordinated or leveraged with that o f external partners in
most sectors, including energy (ADB, JBIC, DFID, U S A I D , K W , CIDA), education (EC, DFID), health
and nutrition (USAID, WHO, EC, DFID. concerned UN Agencies, CDC, A U S A I D , ILO. and other
institutions including the Gates Foundation), and small and medium enterprises financing (DFID, KtX’,
and GTZ). IFC has co-financed investments with ADB, DEG and FMO and has partiiered with ADB.
C I D A , DFID, the EC, the Netherlands and N o r w a y in Small and Mediuiii Enteiyrise ( W E ) developiiiciit
technical assistance in North-East India Since India participates in routine Article I V coiisultations n i t h

the IMF, Bank economists w o r k closely w i t h IMF staff, particularly o n fiscal and niacroecononiic issues.
The last IMF Article I V discussions for India took place o n July 18, 2003.

64.
Generally, coordination has worked well through informal communications at the project team
level, complemented by periodic overview discussions with the various partners, usually in Delhi. During
the FY05-08 strategy period the Bank group would continue to proactively l o o k for opportunities to
ensure coordination and cooperation with external partners in this way. In addition, in the changed donor
landscape, a particular focus in our coordination with the largest external financing sources (ADB, EC,
DFID, Japan, Germany) will be o n efforts to develop common, harmonized financing approaches that are
based on Go1 fiduciary and safeguard arrangements, within the constraints o f evolving Bank policy.
65.
There are considerable overlaps in the areas o f activity between the B a n k aiid ADB in India both institutions have a substantial and growing involvement in infrastructure and in energy, and are also
engaged in adjustment lending to states. Frequent interactions between B a n k and ADB staff, generally
through their N e w D e l h i offices, have been effective in ensuring strong coordination and an open
exchange o f information, to make our activities complementary and mutually reinforcing. The possibility
o f both institutions supporting the national rural roads program through co-financing i s being r e v i e n d .
A coordinated assistance strategy for national roads was j o i n t l y developed by ADB, the Bank and GoI, i s
n o w under implementation and will be updated shortly, The Bank Group and ADB also coordinate in
other sectors, including urbaii development and energy.
66.
A t the suggestion o f DFID, the Bank and DFID India entered into a strategic partnership
agreement in April 2004 that will provide a broad context to the institutions’ cooperation in support o f the
GoI’s development efforts. DFID and the Bank have worked together o n direct budgetary support and
power sector reform in AP and Orissa, and also co-finance (with other agencies) GoI’s centrally
sponsored RCH and education programs. Coinplementary support i s also provided in rural and urban
development and power sector reform.

Box 5: Bank Group Program Priorities and t h e MDGs
In order to achieve the principal national goal o f eradicating extreme poverty and hunger (Goal 1):pi‘o.ere.ssi i i
each of the Bunk’s Pro~ranzPrioritv areas will be important. Similarly, Goal 4 (reducing child and infant
i s an aggregate indicator o f the level o f economic, social and human development; in
mortality - see B o x l),

addition to health care, a range o f socio-economic factors, such as household income and/or assets, the mother’s
education and access to basic infrastructure services, have a direct impact o n child survival rates.

M o s t o f India’s p o o r l i v e in rural areas and studies consistently show that agricultural g r o w t h and improved
marketing, expanding opportunities for f a r m and non-farm employment, developing physical (roads, water,
electricity) and social (schools, health centers) infrastructure and empowering the poorest citizens to access
services, are essential for rural poverty reduction, including hunger-poverty. F o r the urban poor, a good
investment climate, including adequate infrastructure, a vibrant financial sector and competitive m a r k e t s are
critical for creating jobs and improving the quality o f life. The enoi-mous needs in infrastructure and social
services in both urban and rural areas cannot be met without substantial private sector involvement. As the 2004
WDR amply demonstrates, for the benefits o f g r o w t h and infrastructure provision to reach the poor and
disadvantaged segments o f society, significant improvements in the accountability and performance o f public
iiistitutions and more effective public expenditure management, are essential. These are a l l at the core o f Bank
Group support.
The Program Priorities also directly support Goals 2 and 3 (universal primary education and gender equality).
Given the importance o f educational achievement, particularly for girls, for all other measures o f development (a
strong positive impact o f female literacy o n several MDG indicators i s coiisistently reported by a large number
o f studies), B a n k support to education will remain an important line o f business during FYO5-OS. Goals 5
(improving maternal health) and 6 (combating infectious disease) - will require a consolidated effort froiii the
health, education and infrastructure sectors, as broadly supported b y B a n k Priority interventions.
Finally, ensuring environmental sustainability (Goal 7) in India i s central to the lasting success o f the country’s
development efforts, particularly in the context o f accelerating growth and expanding infrastructure.
Environmental management i s supported by B a n k efforts to promote better governance and more effective
public institutions. To the extent that improving fiscal management, one o f the Program Priorities. is consistent
with reducing o r rationalizing p o o r l y targeted subsidies (such as subsidies for power, water, fertilizer,
pesticides), the environment will benefit. A substantial portion o f environmental investment should also come
f r o m regulated industry, corporations and other polluters. In t h i s respect, the development o f a vibrant and
completive private sector, often in place o f former public enterprises, i s expected to significantly improve
environmental performance (provided the regulatory framework i s strong). Finally, B a n k a s s i s t a n c e can
contribute to environmeiital sustainability through reducing vulnerabilities o f poor coiimunities and the
population at large - t o air pollution, dirty water or the risk o f livelihood loss due to natural resource (rvater:
forests, land) degradation.

Improving Government Effectiveness
69.
Strengtheriing Fiscnl Mnizngeiiierit and Realloentirig Public Resources to Priority Areas for the
Poor. As noted in Section I,
India’s high fiscal deficits are not conducive to growth and poverty
reduction over the long run. Deficits at both the federal and state levels have been accompanied by poor
composition o f expenditures, with wages, pensions, interest and subsidies crowding out capital spending
and maintenance, and leading to constraints o n social sector and infrastructure spending. State
govemments are currently borrowing to finance current spending, leaving very l i t t l e r o o m for capital
spending. There i s an urgent need for expenditure restructuring to free up fiscal resources: for reforms to
improve the quality o f spending, and for increased spending in priority areas. There i s scope for savings
in a number o f areas (including o n the salary bill, subsidies, public enterprises, and interest payments).
The quality o f spending i s undermined by various problems, including: skewed composition o f spending
towards salaries; a regressive distribution o f benefits; uneven productivity in t h e c i v i l service; cases o f
corruption; an ineffective spread o f funds across too many projects; and duplication o f services provided
by the private sector.
An important emphasis o f Bank support will continue to be improved fiscal and public

expenditure management that enables state and local govemments to maintain or increase public resource
allocation towards high priority areas - such as social protection programs and basic service provision. 111
continuation with the FY02-04 CAS, this Program Priority i s an explicit focus o f Bank adjustment
lending support to states engaged in comprehensive reform programs (paragraphs 58-59). SALs would
help bolster reform programs centered around revenue mobilization and expenditure reprioritizatioii, set
within the context o f a medium-term fiscal-deficit reducing framework. Improved fiscal management
will also constitute an important part o f the knowledge support - both policy dialogue and TA - offered
to other states engaged with the Bank, especially those with large numbers o f poor citizens (paragraph
55). Capacity building for fiscal management will be an important thematic area o f WBI support,
particularly in Orissa, UP, Jharkhand and Bihar, during FYOS-08 (paragraphs 56-5 7).
71,
The AAA program will continue to include state and local level Financial Accountability
Assessments to underpin any n e w SALs. In addition, a country level assessment (CFAA), would aim at
helping to strengthen financial management systems and outcomes.

72.
Iinprovilzg Goverrzniice and Service Delivery. Simply improving fiscal maiiagenient or the
allocation o f expenditures i s n o t sufficient to achieve the desired result o f improved service delivery,
particularly for the poor. Reforms to reduce administrative fragmentation, reform c i v i l service pay and
pensions and improve the performance o f the c i v i l service through (i)
increased public access to
information; (ii)
strengthened accountability; and (iii)
reduced political interference, are also essential
(Box 2), as are steps to increase the voice o f the poor (paragraph 76) and strengthen decentralization
(paragraph 79). In soiiie states, goveiiiance concerns go beyond t h i s list to issues o f physical security,
l a w and order, social conflict, breakdown in administrative capacity and delays in the resolution o f legal
disputes - all o f which compromise service delivery. Support for governance reforms w i l l remain an
integral part o f the Bank’s w o r k to assist Go1 in strengthening overall government effectiveness in India.
Through state level adjustment lending conducted in partnership with Go1 (paragraphs 5 8-59), a large
part o f the Bank’s investment lending (paragraph 60), as w e l l as through policy advice and t e c h n i c a l
assistance, the Bank will continue to assist interested states in addressing such broad governance issues.
73.
Information technology also opens new possibilities for l o w cost ways to eiiabIe ordinary people.
including the very poor, to access basic services and improve the o ~ e r a lquality

reducing opportunities for con-uption. There have already been very impressive exaiiiples o f t h i s piloted
in India (e g , the Bhoonii program o f coinputenzed land records in Kamataka, citizen utility s e n i c e s L la
the E-seva program and agricultural property registration v i a CARD in AP, and T e l e m e d i c i n e s e n i c e s
22

offered by public health centers in Maharashtra). Some o f the n e w programs have already been
supported by the Bank. An important issue n o w i s h o w to scale up the various successful initiatives,
building on lessons learned. There i s the possibility o f substantial Bank financing support for this via an
E-governance project during the C A S period.
74.
The need to massively strengthen service delivery to ordinary people - w i t h particular attention to
rural areas and programs for health, education and social safety nets - i s an issue that impacts on almost
a l l o f India’s development goals. India’s 73th and 74th Constitutional Amendments mandate greater
decentralization o f services across India and offer important opportunities to increase accountability o f
institutions to voters. The amendments create reserved seats for women and scheduled castes and tribes,
and thus give the most excluded groups in India society a place in the fomial government structure. The
73rd Amendment created a new institution, the Gram Sabha, as the forum for participation o f villagers in
local govemiiient decisions. As a result o f the amendments, electioiis are held regularly and urban and
rural local bodies have become an essential part o f India’s institutional landscape. Implementation o f
decentralization - that i s o f i t s sectoral, fiscal and administrative aspects -has been l e f t to the states.
However, as set out in the Constitutional Amendments, they are progressing at different speeds. B y and
large implementation i s far f r o m complete and local bodies, urban and rural, have not been able to reach
their potential as effective instruments o f development. Local bodies tend to either have f e w resources, or
limited functions or insufficient powers over staff.
75.
T o help India realize the potential o f the constitutional amendments, support to d e c e n t r a l i z a t i o n
will be an increasingly important focus o f Bank w o r k with the Center and the states - to ensure that Bank
programs are both consistent w i t h and supportive o f a progressive s h i f t to decentralized government.
During the past four years, the Bank has supported a r i c h set o f analytical w o r k o n rural decentralization;
the Bank will seek to engage with India in a manner that incorporates the k e y lessons leained f r o m that
effort. L o o k i n g ahead, the Bank’s support will take a number o f forms, including: (i)
continued
knowledge support o n key aspects o f the decentralization agenda (e.g., fiscal decentralization, aspects o f
voice, accountability and participation and c i v i l service reform related to local governments); (ii)ensuring
that the design o f lending operations i s consistent with the development o f decentralized goveinmeiit at its
various levels; (iii)
scaling up o f community-driven development (CDD) approaches with an expanded
lending program for rural livelihood projects (paragraphs 76-85) to increase the voice o f the poor in their
interactions with local government; and (iv) offering financing at the state l e v e l to pilot support for
decentralized institutions at the lowest levels in those states willing to deepen the decentralization reform
agenda.

Investing in People and Empowering Communities
76.
Fostering Empowerment and Rural Livelihoods. A clear lesson o f Bank experience across
South Asia and elsewhere i s that poor people need to have a strong voice In the identification. design and
implementation o f the programs that affect them. Centralized top-down approaches have generally failed
and have l e f t behind large bureaucracies, resistant to change and with l i t t l e accountability to the clients
they serve. Empowerment o f communities and groups, with a special focus o n women and other excluded
segments o f the community, i s an effective vehicle for greater accountability o f goveinment prograiiis and
services.
77.
A second lesson, arising f r o m considerable Bank experience in India, i s that a purely
conservationist approach to natural resources, including forestry, i s not likely to work. Finding win-win
combinations for conservation and poverty reduction i s at the heart o f sustainable natural resources
management. Gradual devolution o f responsibility and rights to local coiiiiiiuiiities i s critical to both long
t e r i i i conservation and development.
23

78.

Thirdly, it i s not sufficient to address the voice or demand side o f the interaction between
communities and government. I t i s also necessary to make governments more responsive to people’s
voices. In the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, the mandate for states to decentralize services from a
comprehensive l i s t o f 29 subjects to district, block and village level governments (the Panchayati Raj
Institutions or PRIs), creates an untapped potential to improve service delivery outcomes. Reserved seats
in these local bodies also ensure that more than one m i l l i o n elected representatives are themselves fi-om
excluded groups, namely women and SC/ST populations. As a result, Panchayats are one o f the most
promising voice mechanisms in India today for these groups.

79.
A hallmark o f most Bank interventions in the rural sector in recent years i s that they have been
built o n the principle o f community empowerment, or CDD, as a major contribution to addressing the
difficult social issues referred to in paragraph 33 -with the a i m o f improving the status o f women and
vulnerable populations within their communities and with both public and private service providers.
CDD has proven to be an important tool in building the platform for better accountability meclianisms
and improving local governance. Whether through community ‘self-help groups’, village committees,
water user’s associations, drinking water supply groups, forest users associations or savings and loan
groups, the Bank’s interventions are focused o n the need to build social capital in the poorest areas and

promote productive investments, income generating activities and natural resources management.

SO.
Based o n this experience, the Bank i s n o w seeking to progressively scale up i t s support to
improved rural livelihoods, particularly through state level interactions. The Bank would be prepared to
engage particularly w i t h the poorest states - particularly Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand and UP (paragraph 57)
- in developing investment operations using a CDD approach. Bank TA and investment lending w i l l
translate into social mobilization and empowerment activities targeted to the poorest and most ~ ~ i l n e r a b l e
segments o f a state’s population, while ensuring that investments are also consistent \vith fiscal and
administrative decentralization. Complementary analytical w o r k offered by the Bank can also help to
clarify issues surrounding property rights (e.g., land reform and administration), an important aspect o f
addressing the economic prospects o f rural communities.
considerable
Some emerging lessons f r o m the projects supporting rural livelihoods are that (i)
upfront investment in both social and economic mobilization and group organization (building social
capital) i s required to ensure that new livelihood opportunities and community infi-astructure investments
yield econoinic returns and are sustained over the long run; (ii)demand driven investments can help poor
communities to demonstrate their credit worthiness to financial institutions and other public and private
institutions; (iii)livelihood promotion should include both farm and non-farm options, including nritliin
agriculture a focus o n value addition and technology introduction; (iv) the community should be enabled
to access a good mix o f public and private service providers; and (v) special efforts need to be made to
organize and provide social and livelihood support services to the most vulnerable groups, such as
disabled persons. In further scaling up B a n k support for rural livelihoods it will be important to have a
strong feedback loop to build lessons learned into the design o f new projects. The B a n k i s currently
conducting a detailed impact evaluation o f existing projects, together with a r e v i e w o f similar projects
financed by government, in collaboration with GoI’s Planning Commission.

8 1.

82.
Particularly in rainfed areas, the Bank will also a i m to support better management of‘
watersheds, while enhancing the livelihood opportunities o f the rural poor. Because o f t h e high
concentration o f India’s poor in rainfed areas, finding solutions to the agricultural production r i s k s o f
variable rainfall i s essential to ensuring that growth i s pro-poor. Where physically and economically
feasible, investment in irrigation i s an obvious solution to eliminate rainfall-related r i s k s . B u t where
irrigation i s not feasible, other measures such as crop diversification and soil and water conservation. can

24

help to mitigate r i s k s for those employed in agriculture, Bank projects w o u l d also support increased
diversification o f household employment and income towards non-fann options.

83.
In forestry, given the complexity o f the issues and the diversity o f India’s forest areas, the Bank
has proposed a long t e r m dialogue with Go1 to foster common understanding o f the constraints to, and
opportunities for, poverty reduction in and around the forest areas. An important part o f the Bank
contribution to this dialogue i s i t s ability to draw lessons f r o m international experience - o n aspects s u c h
as: (i)
policy and legislation affecting people who live in and around forest areas; (ii)organizational
arrangements, including the role o f local governments, forest departments, coinniuni ties and NGOs; (iii)
improving livelihood opportunities for tribal populations; (iv) marketing o f forest products; (1.) incentives
for conservation and sustainable use; and (vi) land use policy f r o m an economic, social, environmental
and legal perspective.
T o supplement this dialogue at the Center, the Bank can offer significant up-front analytic work
84.
and/or piloting o f approaches to states that are interested in partnering with the Bank on forestry issues as
outlined by the guidelines for engagement (Annex 5). The basic premise o f Bank support at the state
l e v e l i s that lending w o u l d be for projects, or project components, that have CDD at their core. The
fundamental objective o f such projects i s the improvement o f incomes and welfare o f poor coniniunities,
through integrated rural development, with a focus on sustainable u s e o f forest resources and appropriate
conferral o f rights. W o r k i s currently underway to prepare projects along these l i n e s in Jharkliand and
across several states.

85.
In some cases, the Bank’s state forestry lending will be focused o n initial pilot activities (for
which trust fund or grant resources may be obtained). In others, large-scale interventions, including those
based on pilots funded by others, may be appropriate. As successful experiences are accumulated, scaling
up o f this program could be considered. The Bank will seek to w o r k with Go1 in sharing knon,ledge and
lessons leamed across states, and informing the debate o n sector-wide policy issues at the Center. A
major report o n the State Forestry Sector i s already underway, for completion in FY0.5. In addition: I F C
will explore further opportunities for supporting sustainable commercial forestry and wood-using
industries, following o n f r o m recent investments in the paper and pulp industry.

86.

Increasing EducationalAttainment f o r All, India’s progress in education i s evidenced by both
increased literacy, considerable increases in both gross and net enrollments and reductions in the gender
gap for education (Table 1). Despite the accomplishments, however: India s t i l l accounts for one-quarter
o f the world’s 104 m i l l i o n out-of-school children. Importantly in relation to many o f the MDGs, girls,
children f r o m the SC/ST populations and children with disabilities have m u c h less access to all l e v e l s o f
education; they also have lower completion rates and transition rates to the next cycle. The quality o f
education i s a big concern, with widespread teacher vacancies and teacher absenteeism, high dropout
rates, inadequate teaching and learning materials and uneven levels o f learning achievement.

87.
GoI’s leadership commitment to increasing educational attainment i s strong. In 2002, the
Constitution was amended to make elementary education a fundamental right o f every child. IDA
support to India’s national elementary education program (SSA), will assist with: (i)increasing
enrollment and reducing out-of-school children by a further 9 million; (ii)
narrowing the remaining
gender gap, and narrowing the social gaps affecting the SCiST population and other groups (including
children with disability); and (iii)
enhancing the quality o f education for all elementary school students.
The program i s ambitious as i t seeks to exceed the goals and t i m e frame o f t h e MDGs. I t s success u.ould
be a major contribution to meeting both GoI’s development goals and the ivIDGs for education o n a
global scale. F o r this reason, support to elementary education will be the principle focus o f the Bank in
the education sector.

25

As a S W A p (Box 4), SSA will be supported by the Bank in the coming years with intensive
supervision, dialogue and advisory services. The Bank’s focus will be very much on helping to improve
the outcoines orientation o f the elementary education system, by strengthening: (i)
government capacity
for continuous review, monitoring and evaluation; (ii)
important areas such as student assessment,
financial management, procurement, tribal development planning and environmental management; and
(iii)
mechanisms for cross-state and cross-district learning. In addition, the Bank and i t s external
financing partners can draw attention to national and international best practice in elementary education
program design and implementation. With good progress, additional financing i s possible.

88.

With elementary education enrollments and completion rates increasing, a growing number of
89.
children will want to access post-elementary education - which has high social and private returns:
including a positive impact o n maternal and child health (through i t s effects o n delayed marriage, reduced
fertility and safer birth practices) and strong links as w e l l to the labor market. In an increasingly
globalized economy driven by knowledge and technology, the ability to use and adapt to technology
needs a minimum threshold level o f s k i l l s beyond elementary education. A larger pool o f n.orlters n.ith
vocational, secondary and higher education i s indispensable to attracting imports o f technologically
advanced goods and foreign direct investment, as w e l l as export o f goods and services. During the CAS
period, the B a n k will also l o o k to provide significant support for improving the performance and reach o f
India’s vocational education and training system. This support would be initiated with analytical work to
underpin n e w B a n k lending for vocational education and training during FYOS-08.
Beyond vocational education and training, policy makers will need to determine [he extent to
90.
w h i c h the increased demand for secondary and higher education will be met mainly f r o m the public sector
or through partnerships with the private sector. The Bank can assist in this by helping to lay the analytical
groundwork for improving the provision and quality o f secondary education - w i t h a special emphasis o n
increasing the participation o f girls. Since life-long learning and tertiary education are also areas o f
considerable importance, the Bank will seek to provide knowledge support in t h i s area, primarily tlu-ough
AAA focused o n better aligning the educational system with the knowledge economy (paragraph 150).
Given the need for selectivity, n o B a n k financing for secondary or tertiary education i s proposed.

91.
Reducing the Health Risks o f the Poor. Achieving progress in health - and in particular for
maternal and child health - has been much more difficult than for other aspects o f India’s development
(Table 1). At the same time an increasing array o f studies and Bank-financed projects (e.g., the statewide A P Rural Poverty Reduction project), point to health r i s k s as being perhaps the greatest concern o f
India’s poor. There are a range o f health sector interventions and services that are critical for the w e l f a r e
o f poor households but reinain woefully inadequate for their needs. These include accessible and good
quality facilities for safe delivery, care for acute respiratory infections and diarrhea i n young cliildren and
effective health and nutrition promotion. Improving health outcomes for the poor will require a concerted
effort to improve b o t h the overall health system o f the states - the public and private sector combined while ensuring a special focus o n the access to, and quality of, health services for the poor.
Though the Bank i s already assisting several states with improving their public health systems, i t
92
i s clear that a shift in Bank support, to focus o n the sector as a whole, i s in order. Recent and ongoing
analytical w o r k - including policy notes on AP’s health, nutrition and population strategy and on the
health systems o f West Bengal and Assam, are supporting this shift. New lending support specific to the
health sector includes the recently approved Rajasthan Health Systems Project State health system
projects are also currently under preparation in T a m i l Nadu, Karnatalta, and Kerala Folio\\ ing from the
guidelines for B a n k engagement in this sector (Annex 5), the n e w projects in these states and in otheis
important to achieving t h e MDGs will seek to break new ground in forging public-private partnerships
(including through progressive separation o f public health financmg f r o m provision). strengthening
oversight o f private providers, increasing public expenditure on health. reorienting health facilities to

26

ensure service for the poor and reducing vulnerability through creation o f health insurance schemes.
There i s also opportunity for increased IFC investment in and technical assistance for private health care
and ancillary service providers.

93.
Undertaking the system refomis required to improve long term development outcomes for
maternal and infant and child health i s essential. Bank support in the health sector at b o t h the state and
national level will be focused on these long term goals. In addition to the state health systeiiis projects, at
the Center the Bank would continue to assist with issues o f family planning, birth spacing and maternal
and child health through i t s lending operations for reproductive and child health.

94.
Reducing the health risks o f the poor, and particularly o f women and children, will also depend
heavily on complementary interventions in areas outside the health sector. Several recent Bank studies
have demonstrated strong effects on infant and child mortality f r o m improved maternal education and
basic infrastructure services, such as access to sanitation, piped water, clean cooking fuels and electricity.
The impact o f infrastructure appears to be particularly significant in the poorer states. Additional research
has shown that one-fifth o f India’s national disease burden can be attributed to eiiviroiiiiiental causes with the largest environinental risks to health coming f r o m the lack o f access to safe water and sanitation?
and cooking w i t h traditional biomass fuels resulting in high levels o f indoor air pollution. These risk
factors contribute to the stubbomly high infant and child mortality rates - and directly impact on India’s
potential for achieving i t s development goals for these indicators, as w e l l as the MDGs inore broadly.
Given the importance o f these concems, the Bank i s in discussion with Go1 and some states on how i t
might, along with the GEF and/or the PCF, support programs which can substantially reduce the impact
o f indoor air pollution by creating a coiiiiiiercial market for clean household energy products and services
in rural areas. T o further strengthen understanding o f health issues related to water supply, a major Bank
study to measure the health impact o f iiiiproved rural water supply i s also underway and \vi11 be
completed in FY06. In addition, projects beyond the health sector will focus more directly on reducing
the health risks o f the poor - for example, in the transport sector, where inclusion o f components on road
safety can have a significant impact o n health.
The Bank has engaged actively in the rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector in
95.
India since 1991. Bank support has helped to pilot and begin to scale up a refonii program for RWSS
delivery across several states - targeting over seventeen n i i l l i o n rural beneficiaries to date. There ha\.e
been some important lessons froin the B a n k engagement. Foremost among these i s that sustainability i s a
major challenge - which i s best addressed by involving coiiiniunities in the design, construction and
operation o f schemes, including through their contribution to capital costs and their financing o f
operations and maintenance costs. Given these lessons, it i s clear that GoUstate investment and Bank
support to RWSS would best emphasize beneficiary involveinent and empowerment; institutional reform
and capacity building o f state/local governments and communities; the active participation o f NGOs;
promotion o f cost recovery; and targeting o f services to the poorest areas and vulnerable groups (Annes

5).
Though official statistics indicate good progress across India, direct observation suggests that the
96.
data substantially overstates access to safe drinking water and sanitation. An ongoing national l e \ le\\
should help to clarify the status across India, as well as help identify w h i c h states have the eakest
coverage in this area. I t IS clear that large investments remain to be made if the MDG for access to safe
water i s to be achieved, and therefore the m a i n challenge i s to r o l l out the lessons leamed on a inuch
larger scale. During FY05-08 the Bank w o u l d be ready to support this objective by lending to states that
decide to adopt a participatory approach to RWSS statewide

97.
T o complement support to the states, the Bank could also offer support to Go1 (both directly and
through the donor funded Water and Sanitation Program), to assist in: (i)
establishing a good nationwide
27

monitoring and evaluation system which updates baseline data for RWSS; (ii)developing national policy
analysis capacity; and (iii)
building the Rajiv Gandhi Mission‘s capacity in reform management. Go1 also
provides considerable funding for RWSS through centrally sponsored programs. Tlie Bank stands ready
to w o r k with Go1 o n steps towards focusing all central funds o n state schemes that meet the reform
criteria; this could open the way to substantial national level financing o f rural water supply by the Bank.

Controlling Infectious Disease. While the control o f infectious disease i s an increasingly
98.
important global concern, i t i s o f critical iinportance for the poor - w h o tend to be affected
disproportionately by such diseases. Given this fact, the Bank will continue to support India’s efforts to
control diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, as w e l l as eradicate leprosy and polio. A project to
strengthen India’s disease surveillance system i s about to commence and would provide the instruments
to inonitor the effectiveness o f disease control programs more broadly. Future Bank support for disease
control i s also focused o n integrating programs at the state level, reorienting public sector interventions
towards priority outcomes and expanding o n opportunities for public-private partnerships. For example,
since most tuberculosis cases are seen by private medical doctors or other private practitioners, there are
important potential benefits to reorienting the state public health system to work more closely with the
private sector. In preparing a possible tuberculosis follow o n project, the Bank strategy i s to encourage an
expansion o f private participation in the program, as w e l l as emphasize t h e links between tuberculosis and
H I V / A I D S . The B a n k i s the Local Fund Agent for a tuberculosis-related grant f r o m the Global Fund to
Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.

99.
In close cooperation with the W o r l d Health Organization (WHO), the Bank supports GoI’s p i i o
eipadication campaign. After much progress towards fully eradicating polio in India, the campaign
suffered a setback in 2002 with a resurgence o f polio cases in several states. Tlie campaign i s n o w in the
process o f being intensified with help f r o m the recently approved supplemental credit for Immunization
Strengthening. Additional resources might come f r o m IDA through reallocation from ongoiiig projects in
the health sector, and, possibly, additional supplementary financing. Through the Ininiuiiization
Strengthening Project, as w e l l as through RCH, the Bank i s seeking to assist Go1 with its routine
immunization program for children and pregnant women: aiming to prevent measles, tetanus, whooping
cough, diphtheria, and childhood tuberculosis in addition t o polio. Go1 and the Bank are exploring ways
to revitalize routine immunization programs in some states where they have been stagnant or even
declining.

IFC will also continue to pursue investments in pharmaceutical and biotech companies, either
directly or through investment funds. This may include investments 111 companies that are developing n e w

products or cheaper production processes which can assist in the control o f infectious diseases

10 1.
I t i s evident that the HIV/AIDS epidemic i s spreading in India (Box 6). The presence o f a n
increasing number o f large donors with differing priorities also has implications for the Bank’s assistance
strategy. W h i l e many donors are focusing on high prevalence areas, virtually only the National Aids
Control Organization (NACO), with IDA assistance, i s working in low and medium prevalence states.
High prevalence states, in addition t o having greater donor assistance, also have relatively higher
implementation capacity, and thus have different needs f r o m other states. Thus, the Bank’s strategy i s to
address the states differentially, taking into account existing capacity as well as the role o f other donors.

28

Box 6: HIV/AIDS in India
Go1 estimates that about 5.1 m i l l i o n individuals were infected with HIV in 2003. The virus can no\v be found in
a l l states and u n i o n territories and NACO confirms that the epidemic has n o w spread beyond high-risk groups to
the community at large in six states w h i c h account for 30 percent o f the total population - AP, Karnataka;
Maharashtra, Manipur, Nagaland, and T a m i l Nadu. HIV i s spread primarily t h o u g h sex, accounting for 84% o f
reported A I D S cases in India. M a j o r contributing factors to HIV infection include the fact that male mobility i s
high, paying for sex i s common and condom use i s low. The h i g h level o f stigma attached t o the disease, and to
some o f the groups engaging in high-risk behavior, further complicates efforts to reach these populations and to
tackle the epidemic.
India’s national H I V / A I D S control program was established in 1986, soon after the first case o f A I D S was
reported. The achievements o f India’s response t o the epidemic have been supported through increased
financing by GoI, t w o credits f r o m IDA ( A I D S Iand II)
and
, financial and technical support f r o m a growing
field o f donors. The WHO, nine UN agencies, as w e l l as their cosponsored program, LTAIDs and bilateral
donors such as USAID, the CIDA and DFID have actively supported Go1 and the states for over a decade.
Programs in recent years have placed greater emphasis o n h i g h impact interventions (prevention among highrisk populations) and on fostering a multi-sector response, by increasing the involvement o f line m i n i s t r i e s other
than health, NGOs and the private sector. However, N G O - l e d interventions for prevention are still limited in
view o f the size o f the problem. Programs were also partially decentralized to the state level, giving states
greater involvement in the definition o f their operational plans, and establishing State A I D S Control Societies
(SACS) outside o f the health sector administration t o ease the flow o f funds t o the states. The capacity o f SACS
to manage state level programs was significantly strengthened.
The number o f major financers and the amount o f funding available has increased significantly in t h e last year.
The Gates Foundation has pledged US$200 inillion for the next 5 years; the Global Fund approved USS26 111. for

102.
Although a great deal has been achieved by Go1 and the states, i t i s clear that important
challenges remain in improving the effectiveness o f GoI’s response both nationally and at the state level.

Fostering a committed leadership and increased awareness in fighting the epidemic. In this
area, the B a n k can gather global experiences on H I V i A I D S prevention and offer ltnowledge
services to public leaders in India. A major study on the long term economic impact o f the
epidemic i s planned, and exercises o n optimizing resource allocation for various interventions
are already underway. The Bank could help to engage officials in policy discussions and
exchange visits with leaders o f other countries and encourage innovative media approaches
using national icons to talk about HIV. IFC’s contribution will be to w o r k w i t h business
associations and client companies to support HIV prevention programs among their worltforces.
Improving institutional arrangements and functions o f the program nationally and at tlie
state level. The Bank could focus on conducting a functional and institutional analysis of
N A C O / S A C S and the role and relationship with the health sector, provide support to introduce
the necessary changes (through A I D S I11preparation and implementation), and develop the
necessary instruments to support the n e w structure.
Improving the overall management o f the program by supporting results-oriented
management practices, linking finance to performance, encouraging systematic monitoring and
evaluation and use o f information for management, strengthening epidemiological and
behavioral surveillance capacity, and improved resource allocation, and
Strengthening capacity for implementation o f executing entities through improved technical
and managerial training, logistics systems, equipment and infrastructure, and technical
assistance.

105.
Through i t s interventions, the Bank Group will also seek to build a multi-sectoral response for
prevention o f H I V I A I D S . While some efforts are already underway in t h e transport sector and in rural
livelihoods projects (which are building awareness and providing support services to H I V i A I D S affected
households), greater attention will need to be placed on finding opportunities to address I-IIVIAIDS in
connection with B a n k and IFC projects across the portfolio.

Promoting Private Sector-Led Growth
106.
Indian policy makers recognize that a vibrant private sector - with f i r m s investing, creating
jobs, and improving productivity - i s central to promoting growth and expanding opportunities for poor
people. Intemational comparisons indicate that India has intrinsic advantages, such as macroeconomic
stability, a large and rapidly growing local market, a large and relatively low-cost labor force, a critical
mass o f well-educated workers, and abundant r a w materials, that should allow i t to attract and sustain
much higher levels o f private investment, domestic and foreign. At the same time, recent studies sho\v
that the private sector in India continues to be constrained by a number o f factors. The most important
constraints concern market distortions arising f r o m policies on tariffs and domestic taxes, l i i i i i t s o n
foreign direct investment (FDI); other product market distortions arising f r o m industrial policy,
particularly related to small enterprises, and the pricing and marketing o f agricultural products;
government interference in business entry and operations; impediments to the functioning o f land and
labor markets; financial sector inefficiencies which impede access to capital, for productive private

30

investment, including SMEs; severe infrastructure bottlenecks; and dominance o f state-owned enterprises.
In addition, in some states, basic issues o f maintaining l a w and order are constraints identified by the
private sector. The success in achieving the ambitious targets set by the Tenth Plan will depend crucially
o n progress in these areas. In particular, a key challenge i s h o w t o make growth iiiore effective in
generating employment opportunities, especially for young people.

While the best Indian manufacturing and service companies have established leading positions
107.
internationally, demonstrating the potential o f Indian industry, the industrial sector as a whole i s still in
the early stages o f adjusting to the pressures o f international competition. The Bank Group has a role to
play in helping Indian companies restructure and invest to achieve global standards o f competitiveness, as
well as corporate governance and environmental and social sustainability. In addition, the inyestment
climate remains weak in many areas (Annex 7) and will hamper private sector growth without concerted
efforts to build institutions and reform policies and regulations.
108.
The B a n k Group will offer support for addressing the key constraints to private sector-led growth
and competition, Given the respective mandates o f the Bank Group institutions, IBRDiIDA will focus on
helping t o strengthen an enabling policy and institutional environment for private sector development at
both the Center and state levels and financing the public part o f PPP transactions. I F C will mainly
provide financing and technical assistance to the private sector, focused on supporting competitive
industry and services and private investment in infrastructure. In collaboration w i t h the Bank, IFC wilf
also provide targeted technical assistance to governments in specific areas, such as promoting FDI and the
business climate for SMEs. The Bank and IFC will look to w o r k together closely to support PPP in
infrastructure, health and education and SME development, where a mix o f public sector interventions
and investment and technical assistance to private companies i s required.
109.
Provision of Adequnte Iitfinstiwctrire. India’s infrastructure needs are massive, beyond the
capacity o f the public sector to meet, but significant policy and regulatory barriers remain to greater
private sector participation. The Bank Group will focus o n addressing the policy and regulatory issues as
well as financing public investment, private investment and PPPs in the sectors where reforms have
advanced sufficiently to make the necessary larger-scale public investments effective and to attract
private investment. While the Bank Group role in helping India t o address cross-border issues in
infrastructure development (e.g., in water, power and gas) i s currently limited, during the strategy period
the B a n k Group w o u l d stand ready to expand i t s support for regional cooperation initiatives at the request
o f GoI.
110.
Telecoms was the first sub-sector o f infrastructure where GoI’s implementation o f reforms
reached a critical point at which large scale private investment has taken off, resulting in 115 percent
growth in cellular service users over the past year. These reforins were supported during the previous
CAS period by a B a n k Telecommunication Sector Reform loan; in exercising selectivity, t h e Rank will
phase out o f lending in this sub-sector. However, I F C has a continuing role to help private companies
mobilize the large amounts o f investment required to raise telecommunications coverage from t h e current
very l o w levels, especially in rural areas. As o f M a r c h 2004, fixed l i n e connectivity stood at
approximately 4.6 percent o f the population, while mobile connectivity stood at an estimated 3.1 percent.
Other sub-sectors where Go1 actions to improve the policy and regulatory environment could realistically
lead to significant private investment in the near t e r m are power, roads, ports and airports. Preliminary
data for 2003 (World Bank P P I Project Database) suggests that n e w legislation has initiated an increase in
private investment in the power sector, with an almost 250 percent jump f r o m 2002 levels. Private
investment in roads has increased sharply since 1998, with investment in 2002 o f USS339 million - more
than five times the average for the 1990s.

31

111. The power sector continues to be one o f the greatest constraints to maintaining growth and
further reducing poverty in India. M u c h o f the population remains unconnected to the public power
system, and those who are connected often receive infrequent and unreliable service, making power
supply a brake o n private sector development and economic growth. Operating performance i s w e l l
below commercial standards. Tariffs are seriously distorted with an unsustainably high degree o f cross
subsidy, and o n average do not come close to covering the costs o f service provision. L o w tariffs do not,
however, benefit most o f the poor who largely lack access, especially in rural areas. The power sector’s
claim o n government financial resources i s so large that reform o f the sector i s critical to India’s f i s c a l
adjustment and growth prospects - financial losses o f the sector are running at 1.5 percent o f GDP. W e a k
intemal management in the state electricity boards (SEBs) and poor public govemance r e s u l t in an
abnormally high level o f theft, leakages and losses that tariffs cannot absorb fully. Technical and
commercial losses amount to between 40-50 percent o f electricity generated in some Indian states. As
governments ultimately become liable for the losses o f their utilities, this has exacerbated t h e fiscal
deterioration in many states.
112. Reform o f power distribution i s the first priority for improving the commercial performance and
financial viability o f the power sector. At the same time, even if the current level o f losses was reduced
dramatically, large investments in additional generating capacity will still be essential if p o n w
availability i s not to constrain India’s capacity for rapid growth.
1 13.
In recent years a number o f states have worked to improve the commercial perforinaiice o f their
state utilities, unbundling state entities, creating more independent regulatory systems, and putting in
place measures to control losses and theft, However, progress has been difficult, and slower than many
originally hoped, reflecting the great challenge o f overcoming entrenched political opposition to reform
and the complexity o f the pre-conditions for commercial viability. The Bank Group has advocated
complementary strategies for the state power sector as follows:
0

0

Facilitating serious, long-term; private sector involvement in improving and expanding services,
which in the next f e w years means: (i)
focusing on the steps which would eventually allow the
relatively commercially viable segments o f the distribution network t o be privatized successfully;
(ii)increasing private investment in transmission; and in parallel; (iii)developing a1temative
strategies for improving services and targeting subsidies in rural areas.
Improving SEB performance, pending privatization, particularly through: (i)
advancing SEB
unbundling, including initiatives to implement open access to transmission and distribution
networks and the establishment o f capable and independent regulatory agencies; (ii)ensuring that
subsidy delivery mechanisms are explicit and transparent; (iii)
strengthening payment discipline;
(iv) independent audit o f power company accounts prepared to international accounting
standards, and improving management information systems; and (v) improving the management
and accountability o f utility staff for commercial perfomiance.

114.

Learning f r o m experience, Bank engagement in the power sector at the state l e v e l i s premised on
the view that, while i t s knowledge resources and advisory support have potential to add value throughout
a state’s reform process, its lending, to be o f value in improving services, must be linked to real progress
in reform - both in t e r m s o f improved financial performance, and in tenns o f irreversible structural and
govemance changes. O n this basis, Bank financing support in this sector can be provided o n a selective
basis, with differing types o f support to the states contingent o n where they are in the reform process and
the level o f political commitment to reforms (Annex 5). Where a state government i s indicating a serious
interest in pursuing reforms, the Bank could, either directly or through Go1 programs, provide technical
assistance in the shaping o f r e f o m i strategies. In states that are following through with strong initial
reform actions, Bank investment lending would be focused o n areas that directly support reform - for

32

example metering, transformer replacement or voluntary retirement schemes Eventually, in states that
move forward with well-designed privatization transactions and the facilitation o f n e w entry - the Bank
Group would be able to offer a hariety o f forms o f support, depending on local needs and conditions. and
the response o f prnate investors. These could include credit enhancement instruments s u c h as partial risk
guarantees.
115.
At the national level, recent reform progress in the form o f tlie passage o f the Electricity A c t 2003
has opened the way for competition in power transmission and distribution, power trading and market
development, and new providers o f power supply in rural areas. In addition, tlie GoI-led initiative o f
securitization o f past dues o f the central power utilities has improved the collection o f state power dues
and commercialization o f the sector. These reforms have encouraged greater private investor interest in
power projects and provide the basis for a n e w partnership with tlie Center and the B a n k Group to s~ipport
ti~aiisiizission,distribution and ge17eration in India.
116.
F o r transmission, the Bank Group could support investments in Powergrid to strengthen the
national transmission network, and raise the inter-regional power transfer capacity. Investiiients would be
aimed at improving the outcomes-orientation and service delivery o f Powergrid, by: (i)
facilitating inore
economic use o f generation resources; (ii)
providing greater grid stability; (iii)
establishing tlie open
access regime mandated in the new Electricity Act; and (iv) facilitating development o f a power trading
market within the country and with India's neighbors. I F C could mobilize private financing for
transmission, building o n the successful model o f the Tala transmission line, w h i c h w a s financed as a
joint venture between Go1 and Tata Power with IFC support.
1 17.
F o r generation, there i s potential for private sector development and financing in theriizal power
generation during the CAS period. The B a n k would also offer investments in Izydi~oelectricgeiiei'atioi?
capacity that can be developed with limited social and environmental impacts. The key objectives for
Bank involvement would be to (i)help increase generating capacity in tandem w i t h other Go1 prograiiis to
improve performance o f the distribution and transmission sectors; and (ii)
help the sector to coiisolidate
recent improvements and move towards iiitemational best practice for environmental and social
safeguards. While for many years the hydropower business in India had a poor reputation, soiiie major
actors (including the NHPC) have started to improve their environmental and social safeguards practices.
Given this, during FYO5-08, the Bank will w o r k with Go1 and i t s PSUs to seek possible n e w avenues for
support o n a modest scale for hydropower development. I F C will also continue t o invest i n generating
capacity, mainly through captive power plants, especially cogeneration plants which bring environmental
benefits, in independent power producers (IPPs) with creditworthy off-takers (e.g., power trading entities
or industrial users) and in merchant plants. (See paragraphs 143-144 for a discussion o f R u r a l
Electricity)
118.
Similar to power, water i s key to both growth and poverty alleviation in India - yet despite large
investments over decades, India remains quite poorly endowed with w a t e r i n f r a s t r r r c t i ~ r c Tlie
pievalence o f poverty i s three t i m e s higher in non-irrigated districts Tlie provision o f r e l i a b l e watei
supply greatly benefits the poor because o f the substantial health benefits - wi t l i \\omen and girls in riii a1
areas especially benefiting because o f the burden and wasted time o f fetching water over long distances.
119.
L i k e most other countries, India has not managed either water services - hydropower (paragiapli
117), irrigation (paragraphs 138-139), municipal and industrial water supply (paragraphs 128-132) and
rural water supply (paragraphs 95-97) - or the resource itself well. There are f e w mechanisms for
ensuring that water i s allocated to the highest-value uses and that reallocation can take place as societal
needs change. And there are few incentives for using water efficiently, and for internalizing the
environmental costs o f inefficient use With this, an important focus o f Bank support i s to help Go1 and
the states in improving the allocation and manageinent o f water resources in support o f po\ erty reduction

33

120.
India faces a host o f water resource management challenges. While resources are finite, deniands
are increasing continuously. In many areas demands are already outstripping supply, with resulting
serious impacts on stream f l o w and aquatic ecosystems, and, most strikingly, o n groundwater. At t h e
same time there i s insufficient infrastructure and institutional capacity to address recurrent drought and
flood challenges. And in many areas, water quality concerns are just as important as quantity problems.
Addressing these challenges is, first and foremost, an institutional and instrument issue. The
overwhelming necessity i s to introduce greater flexibility in allocation, and to sharply increase incen ti\.es
for more efficient u s e o f water and reductions in pollution. But i t i s also a technical challenge and
problem that will require large investments in infrastructure (for flood control, drainage, storage,
sanitation, wastewater treatment, etc.)

121.
In helping India to address i t s broad water challenges, the B a n k i s engaging with its i n v e s t m e n t
lending primarily at the state level - via project components that are focused on strengthening the policy
framework and institutional capacity for overall water resources management. At the Center, the Bank i s
mainly providing policy advice and analysis, including through a inaj or study, n o w being prepared: on
India’s strategic water challenges. The highest returns o f water resource management l i e in rehabilitation
and upgrading o f existing infrastructure. Go1 i s looking at different approaches t o address major water
constraints and the Bank i s assisting Go1 in i t s study o f some o f the issues by sharing international
experience in this area. There may also be a role for IFC financing to bring in private investment in water
infrastructure and IFC advisory services to bring in private management o f water utilities as part of
public-private partnerships.
122.
While the B a n k Group’s engagement in transport mainly supports India’s growth agenda, i t will
also contribute to empowerment o f the poor and vulnerable groups by helping improve access to markets.
jobs and services. India’s transport sector investment needs are enonnous, and, in any scenario, meeting
them will require substantial increases in public investment - a major challenge given India‘s current
fiscal constraints. Clearly, a strong focus on better allocation and use o f public expenditures, greater
resource mobilization f r o m users and efforts to leverage scarce public funds with private fiinding will also
be o f critical importance. In pursuing these goals, the Bank’s contribution w o u l d be to help close the
implementation gap that currently exists between Go1 policies and current sector practice on the ground.
In recent years, the Bank’s transport assistance has focused o n a large program o f investment
123.
lending for izatioizal and state Izig1zwaj)s. At the national level, recent Bank support h a s focused on
supporting the National Highways Development Program (the Golden Quadrilateral). While some furlher
support to this program - including finance o f a critical link between the states o f UP and Bihar - i s
expected, i t i s likely t o be the last operation given the availability o f alternative finance. The Bank may
also support upgrading o f investments in the most heavily trafficked sections o f the national highways
managed by the Ministry o f Road Transport and Highways, as w e l l as support that Ministry’s reform
agenda. The mandate o f NHAI has recently been expanded to include improvement o f a fiirther 1O:OOO
kilometers o f national highways, to be implemented as a network-wide PPP. Substantial Bank as well as
IFC support for this n e w program i s envisaged. Further, the Bank will engage and provide an advisory
role in Go1 efforts to prepare an expressway system, possibly leading to financial engagement after the
Tenth Plan period. In state Iziglzways, the Bank will selectively engage new states on t h e basis o f
guidelines for engagement set out in Annex 5. IFC would offer financing for private road construction
and maintenance contracts that transfer significant commercial r i s k to the private sector. (See paragraphs
140-142 for a discussion o f Rural Roads)
Urban Transport i s a high-risksub-sector with fragmented responsibilities, weak fiscal and
124.
implementation capacities o f local bodies, and complex safeguard issues. I t i s also potentially highreturn, especially i f an emphasis o n management improvements and traffic engineering helps defer high

34

cost investments in mass transit and flyovers. Given the r i s k s and competing demands o n Bank
resources, Bank lending support will be through pilots incorporated into operations to support broader
municipal reforms. This engagement will be selective, focusing first on investments that have short
paybacks, such as traffic engineering and management, busways, and slum accessibility. Drawing lessons
f r o m these pilot engagements, the Bank will thereafter seek opportunities for scaling up. I F C may also
provide support in this area by investing in infrastructure development companies that are constructing
and operating urban transport infrastructure.
There i s strong demand froin Go1 for the Bank to help modeiiiize raihvays in India. While there
125.
i s some limited scope for private investment in r a i l spurs or rolling stock services which I F C could
finance, the main requirement i s for substantial investment in the public system run by Indian Railn.ays if
i t i s to compete with other transport modes effectively. Indian Railways has suffered operating losses
due to unfunded public service obligations and increased competition f r o m road transport, and there are
growing concerns o n the safety o f i t s operations. B a n k involvement can help to improve the quality o f
public expenditure, ease critical capacity constraints and improve safety outcomes. However, w i t h 1.5
m i l l i o n employees and a very traditional approach to the railway business, reforming the railways i s a
high-risk proposition, requiring a mix o f analytical w o r k and a staged financial engagement
commensurate with reform progress. The Bank i s proposing some financial commitment in the near term
to support safety related investment as well as capacity expansion. The Bank will consider supporting a
major investment program provided that the investment i s economic and consistent with Indian Railway’s
reform agenda o f moving towards becoming a commercialIy viable entity.
Although there has recently been some limited improvement in the operational efficiency o f some
126.
o f the major ports in India, and a growing number o f private ports, much s t i l l remains to be done to
address this significant constraint o n India’s growth. India, as with the rest o f the region, lags the world
in port system management - leading to long cargo clearance times and associated costs to the economy.
There i s s t i l l huge scope for r e f o m i inports and logistics. A major Ports Bill that has recently been tabled
in Parliament may provide the impetus and direction for further reform, including in the areas o f customs,
business process simplification and greater competition. In FY05-08, initial engagement by the Bank
could be through an analysis o f port operations to help identify priorities for investment and policy
reform. This may lead to a project for priority port investments late in the strategy period. I F C will offer
financing to foreign and domestic port operators and logistics companies investing in private ports and
associated infrastructure and equipment. I F C could also help to mobilize financing for coninierciall y
viable privately-owned Special Economic Zones, w h i c h combine transport, power and water
infrastructure to create attractive locations for private investment.
Finally, the Bank could provide limited TA in the civil aviatioii sub-sector to h e l p formulate
127.
improved regulation that could encourage greater private sector involvements in airports. IFC i s iii
discussion with major private sector players who are potential concessionaires in the sector, w i t h a view
to playing an advisory or financing role. In order to help demonstrate best practice, the Bank might
consider providing support to a private sector-led airport project, in conjunction with IFC, by helping to
fund a public contribution.
India’s urban areas are home to 25 percent o f the country’s poor. Today, the typical urban
128.
resident in India has an almost one-in-four chance o f living in a s l u m compared to 20 years ago when the
probability was only about one-in-six. This rapid growth o f s l u m s i s a reflection o f the rapid influx to
urban areas, combined with poorly performing urban real estates markets, weak property rights and the
inability o f cities to finance and deliver services o n a sustainable basis. The current urban population of
300 m i l l i o n residents i s expected to double over the next 25 years, creating new demands for services in
addition to the backlog to meet today’s needs - the needs o f one o f the most extensive systems o f cities

India's cities could contribute to the country's economic growth, and poverty reduction, if they did not
suffer so severely f r o m infrastructure bottlenecks, service deficiencies, poor local governance and
distortions in land and factor markets. W i t h over h a l f o f GDP produced in urban areas, achieving
meaningful urban reform i s a GO1priority for reaching and sustaining the national growth rates o f 8
percent.

Within this context, there i s a convergence o f views on the role that India's cities need to play in
promoting economic development and poverty reduction. The Bank strategy i s t o support the urban
reform agenda o f the Tenth Plan to empower citizens and improve property rights; liberalize land
markets; improve the governance, incentives and financing capacity o f urban local governments and their
service providers; encourage improvements in local finances and revenue mobilization making c i t i e s less
dependent o n state and central flows and enabling them to gradually access sustainable forms o f finance;
and facilitate private sector participation.

At this early stage o f the reform process, the focus i s on supporting investments in service

delivery in the context o f a broader institutional and policy reform framework, without which the
sustainability o f investments cannot be assured; and o n exploring ways in which low-income groups can
improve their living conditions, including through improved security o f tenure. Knowledge activities
would form a basis for the dialogue with stakeholders at the central, state and local levels and capacity
building for municipal reform would be offered by WBI. Possible issues for study and engagement
include: (a) public-private options in service delivery and barriers to PPP; (b) a review o f subsidies in the
urban sector; (c) urban poverty; (d) urban land; (e) a Water and Sanitation MDG Action Plan (already
underway); and (0 monitoring and evaluation in the Urban Water and Sanitation Sector (UWSS).
At the national level, the Bank would through AAA and/or lending activity support (1) the design
and implementation o f incentive based programs, such as the Urban Reform Incentive Fund (URIF), that

13 1.

reward state-level urban reform aimed at creating an enabling environment for urban local go\ ei-nnients to
improve service delivery and the functioning o f real estate markets; (11) the introduction o f greater
efficiency in centrally funded/sponsored financing schemes and their alignment n f i t l i centi a1 reform
initiatives; and (111) assistance to weaker states t o improve performance and meet conditions o f entry for
central incentive schemes.

At the state level, investment lending w o u l d be to reforming states that are: (i)
committed to
132.
creating a better enabling environment for cities and urban service providers t o deliver services at scale
and in a sustainable manner; and (ii)substantially improving citizen empowerment, access to land rights
and land market functioning. Projects could include: (i)
investments covering a range o f urban services
with competitive access for Urban Local Bodies to credit, similar to the approach already being taken in
T a m i l Nadu; and (ii)programmatic lending covering a range o f sub-sectors or a sub-sector (e.&. s l u m
upgrading, solid waste) focused o n decentralized delivery. Recognizing the weak performance in the
UWSS, the Bank would place special emphasis o n this sector through :(i) loans in states that are willing
to develop statewide programs aimed at improved govemance, increased efficiency and cost recovery,
and an appropriate regulatory framework to encourage sustainable delivery and private sector
participation in UWSS; and (ii)
investments for pilot programs that provide a deiiioiistratioii effect to gain
more widespread support for reform o f UWSS. At the level o f India's nzegucities, lending would be in
sub-sectors (e.g., transport, UWSS, solid waste slum upgrading) aimed at supporting key sub-sector
reforms, with selection o f the cities and sub-sectors driven by demand. I F C i s also exploring the
provision o f municipal financing to support urban infrastructure investments.

Accelerating R u r a l Growth. As highlighted in “India: Re-energiziizg the Agriczilfui.al Seclor fo
Sustain Growth and Reduce Povevty”6, India has made significant advances towards achieving its goals o f
rapid agricultural growth, improving food security and reducing rural poverty during the l a s t four
decades. Sustained foodgrain (rice and wheat) production growth that exceeded the population growth
rate eliminated the threat o f famines and acute starvation in the country. Go1 investments in agricultural
research and extension, irrigation and other rural infrastructure - complemented by subsidies for k e y
inputs such as fertilizer, water and improved seeds - launched the country into the “Green Revolution”
f r o m which it continues to benefit today. However, the slow-down in agricultural growth in the 1990s i s
a major concem. Agriculture employs about 60 percent o f the labor force in India and about 80 percent of
India’s poor live in rural areas, many o f w h o m depend upon agriculture for their livelihoods. Most o f the
rural poor are small farmers with low land and labor productivity at the edge o f survival, and landless
people seeking to sell their labor. Given this, the Tenth Plan has placed high priority on raising
agricultural productivity to achieve an annual agricultural gromYh rate o f 4 percent.
As noted in both B o x 2 and paragraph 32, some o f India’s most important remaining reforms are
134.
in the agricultural sector. The current policy regime, which i s founded on achieving foodgrain selfsufficiency through high price support and large input subsidies (fertilizer, irrigation and power) i s not
compatible with the changed environment o f the twenty-first century. Indeed, India i s faced with
problems o f plenty with respect to foodgrains, while at the same time agricultural policies are
discouraging farmers f r o m diversifying to other, higher value crops that could potentially be an important
source o f growth. In addition, ago-industry, which i s composed largely o f micro- and small enterprises,
has the potential to foster greater value addition in India’s agriculture and generate employment in rural
areas. B o l d action f r o m policymalters will be required to move away f r o m the existing subsidy-based
regime and instead invest in building a solid foundation for an internationally competitive agricultural
sector.
135,
Increasing agricultural productivity and diversification to higher value products, including
crops, livestock and fisheries, will be instrumental to re-energizing the agricultural sector to achieve
higher growth. T o achieve these goals, i t will be essential to foster broad-based availability and adoption
o f improved agricultural technologies and practices by farmers and closer integration o f farmers with
input and output markets. Through AAA, lending and TA, the Bank will assist in strengthening the
agricultural research and extension system at the national and state levels, w i t h efforts to promote
demand-driven, decentralized public agricultural research and extension systems, greater public-private
partnerships, and closer linkages with various domestic and international sources o f technologies and
knowledge. The B a n k will also assist states in facilitating access by farmers to markets through improved
rural infrastructure and market services (e.g., v i a support for rural roads).

136.
I F C will offer financing and technical assistance to companies in agriculture, agro-processing and
agricultural input supply that expand their operations and iiiiprove their productive efficiencies as a result
o f the ongoing deregulation o f agricultural markets. Priorities will be o n projects that: (i)improve the
efficiency o f food supply chains, (ii)
have a broader development impact by providing quality inputs and
services or integrating the production o f local farmers into commercial supply chains; and (iii)introduce
resource-saving technologies. Such support may involve technical assistance or mobilization o f financing:
as well as community development activities. This will strengthen the competitive position o f the
processing f i r m s .
137.
Bringing n e w lands under irrigation has, along with Green Revolution technologies, been central
to India’s success in food grain self-sufficiency. I t has also had a powerful impact on urban poverty (by

keeping food prices down) and rural poverty (primarily through creation o f a demand for labor). But i t i s
clear that dark clouds are on the horizon - productivity gains are falling and there are major
environmental problems due to inefficient use o f water, with groundwater mining an especially troubling
reality. There is, accordingly, a need to reexamine the issue o f water productivity.
Hence, for irrigation and drainage infrastructure, Bank programs will focus on helping to
138.
improve the productivity o f water and the poverty impact o f investments. The Bank strategy i s to
facilitate state irrigation and drainage reforms and help create, modernize, and improve the management
o f these assets. Bank lending to a state will be within the context o f a state’s long t e r m program, allowing
time for reform concepts to become firmly rooted. Lending would need to be based upon a shared vision
for: (i)
de-linking water resource management f r o m irrigation; (ii)
strengthening cost recovery; (iii)
beneficiary participation; and (iv) focusing o n investments w i t h the highest returns: for iiiiproved
irrigation and drainage service delivery and increased productivity o f water. This programmatic
approach i s based o n the fact that reforms at the state level are going to take at least a decade to be fully
implemented and a flexible response within a vision covering the long-term time horizon i s needed.
Bank support will also entail luiowledge-based services to assist reforming states, including niobiliziiig
global experience, TA and advice, and preparing policy notes and options papers. Finally, the Bank could
help to transfer knowledge and experiences across states and assist in building consensus and
commitment for effective irrigation strategies.

139.

Better planning, deployment and management o f irrigation and drainage infrastructure i s
particularly important in Karnataka, AP, T a m i l Nadu, Orissa, MP, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP, Bihar,
Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana - all o f which have major existing infrastructure and considerable
additional potential to be developed. O f these, Bihar, U P and MP have the greatest nuinber o f rural poor
who could benefit f r o m iinprovenients in the sub-sector. In order to focus its support most effectively, the
Bank will seek t o intensify i t s relationship with those states that are willing to adopt or coininit to the
basic building blocks o f successful projects in the sub-sector. These building blocks have b e e n shown b y
experience to include unbundling o f water resource management, improved business processes in
irrigation and drainage institutions, a greater focus o n service delivery and improving the revenue base
and collections. Importantly, decentralized service delivery mechanisms, such as water users associations
and publidprivate partnerships, including concessions for management o f infrastructure, will continue to
be emphasized. Other key aspects o f the guidelines for Bank engagement in the sub-sector are outlined in
Annex 5.

140.
In rural transport, an estimated 330,000 habitations out o f the 825,000 habitations in India are
without all weather road access. Connectivity levels vary greatly between and within states. As detailed
in the DPR, m u c h o f the rural road network i s poorly maintained and severely deteriorated - impeding
access to services for citizens o f rural areas and creating a major constraint o n India’s development.
Villages are often cut o f f from the outside w o r l d for long periods during monsoons and i t i s estimated that
20-30 percent o f agricultural, horticultural and forest produce i s wasted due to lack o f roads to carry
produce to markets and processing centers. Given these problems, and the critical importance o f rural
road networks in helping to achieve MDG indicators (e.g., for education and health), an increasing part o f
B a n k support going forward will be on supporting govemment’s efforts in this area.
141
To address the poor rural accessibility in a inore systematic way, a centrally sponsoi ed scheme.
the Prime Minister’s Rural Road Program (PMGSY) was announced in late 2000 At a cost o f

approximately USS12 billion, the P M G S Y seeks to achieve all weather access to every habitation with a
population o f 500 or more by the end o f the Tenth Plan period This i s expected to make a significant
contribution towards India’s efforts to meet the MDGs, but will likely require substantial external fLinding
to complete.

38

142.
The Bank i s preparing the first in a series o f loansicredits to support the P,\/IGSY, u i t h an
investment o f about US$400 m i l l i o n focused o n the most poorly connected districts within four o f the
most poorly connected states (UP, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Himachal Pradesh). ADB has already
committed to, or intends to fund the other six most poorly connected states. During preparation, the Bank
i s working with the Ministry o f Rural Development to improve the effectiveness and sustainability o f Go1
and state expenditures by focusing o n a core network, improving design and construction standards, and
improving funding for maintenance and program delivery more generally. Beyond this initial project, the
Bank will a i m to scale up i t s support to rural roads by expanding the coverage o f its financing, jointly
with ADB, in support to P M G S Y .
143.
The potential for r u r a l electrification to contribute to economic development and poverty
reduction has also not been fully realized in India. While some states have achieved 'village'
electrification rates o f 90 percent or higher, others lag far behind - o n average, electricity reaches only 44
percent o f rural households, Where service i s available, supply i s unreliable and poor in quality, imposing
additional costs on households. Subsidized prices are a serious financial burden on b o t h the Center and
state level governments, and when combined with the high costs o f rural service, serve as a disincentive
to invest in rural expansion. The rural tariff structure i s distorted and encourages inefficient use o f
electricity. Technical and non-technical losses are excessive. These factors, combined with political
interference and weak incentives for efficiency, have resulted in a rural system that i s not financially
viable.

144.
The 2003 Electricity A c t enables entry of new providers of rural electricity services, such as user
associations, co-operative societies, N G O s and franchisees. In addition, Go1 has indicated i t s intention to
move to a policy o f using transparent capital subsidies, where needed, to support the expansion o f rural
access, but l o o k for full recovery o f recurrent costs in new access projects. The states with the greatest
need in this area (as measured by households with n o access to electricity) currently include UP, Bihar,
West Bengal, Orissa and AP. In this context, the Bank i s working with Go1 o n an initial engagement in
rural electricity access focused o n (i)
provision o f advisory services, to support the design and
iniplementation o f new institutional mechanisms to finance and provide business and technical support to
n e w rural electricity service providers; and (ii)
support for initiatives that deiiionstrate the potential o f
new institutional arrangements to mobilize innovative technical and organizational options for the
delivery o f sustainable rural electricity services. Through the project, the B a n k i s seeking to provide
impetus for renewable energy options. There may be potential to scale up Bank Group assistance
(including IFC financing for PPPs) based o n the experiences o f this operation during the latter part of'the
C A S period.
145.
Improved access to r u r a l finance i s a key ingredient o f promoting rural growth and productivity
and iinproving livelihoods. W h i l e India has a wide network o f rural finance institutions, as highlighted in
the India DPR, many o f the rural poor remain underserved or completely l e f t out o f the formal financial
system. The rural non-fanii sector also faces constraints to getting finance. Various estimates suggest
that India's rural poor rely almost entirely o n informal sources (money lenders, traders, etc.) to meet their
consumption credit needs - at annual interest rates ranging f r o m 36 percent to 120 percent a year.
Building o n a recently completed AAA, a Bank-supported rural finance investment operation could
emerge to help address critical gaps for w h i c h a public sector role i s important, capitalizing on the
existing branch network o f rural banks and leveraging on innovative financial delivery models and
practices that have evolved in the private sector (including micro finance). Bank-supported rural
livelihoods programs (paragraphs 76-85) will also continue to help improve access to finance I'or self-help
groups o f women and vulnerable sections such as SC/ST and disabled persons. IFC will support
financial institutions serving rural enteiyrises, including coiiiiiiercial microfinance institutions.

39

146.

Fosteringthe Competitive Economy. Building o n the considerable analytical work completed
in analyzing the investment climate across India’s states, in the coining years the Bank will use the
survey results to help advise o n critical reforms for improving the investment cliiiiate in states where the
Bank i s most actively involved (paragraph 55) or about to be involved) and will offer technical assistance
for implementation o f reforms to improve the investment climate, This will also be an important area for
WBI capacity building efforts, particularly, ifthere i s interest f r o m the states, in UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and
Orissa (paragraphs 56-57). The focus will be o n streamlining and re-engineering business entry and
operation procedures, for example, through introducing “single window” and “deemed” clearances;
improving the legal framework, for example labor laws and laws governing the sale and transfer o f land;
and introducing VAT.

147.
At the Center, the Bank could selectively use investment lending, coupled w i t h AAA to foster
competitiveness. Proposed Bank support in this area could include lending to help improve access to
finance by sinall and medium enterprises (SMEs) and address the broader financial sector and industrial
policy issues that affect S M E performance and competitiveness. The B a n k could also offer its hhh to
provide knowledge support to build consensus for key refomis, such as trade and tariff reforms, FDI
regulations, improving corporate restructuring and bankruptcy procedures, SOE reform, and competition
policy (through a recently approved IDF grant). IFC, through programs such as the South Asia
Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) and the Foreign InvestmentAdvisory Service, could provide
technical assistance for more detailed diagnostic work, and to support implementation o f reforms aimed a t
improving the investment climate for foreign and domestic investors.
148.
IFC will continue to invest in manufacturing companies that are: (a) developing new products and
markets; (b) restructuring and modemizing to become internationally competitive; and (c) expanding and
moving towards establishing a regional or global presence. I F C will focus o n providing long-term debt
and equity which may not be available fi-oin domestic financial markets, and would add value in the area
o f global best practices; assistance in creating global partnerships and entering n e w markets, especially in
developing countries, where IFC’s global presence has an important role to play; and advice and technical
assistance to companies to improve the environmental and social sustainability o f their businesses, and
improve their corporate governance.
A k e y element o f fostering competitiveness i s enhancing the capacity o f the financial systcm to
149.
inobilize and allocate resources inore efficiently. T o this end, in addition t o the selected engagements
highlighted in paragraphs 145 and 147, the Bank can offer knowledge resources that: (a) support
improved financial regulation, supervision and legal enforcement; (b) help to develop capital niarltets:
particularly debt markets, w h i c h are critical to mobilizing longer-term resources, particularly for
infrastructure investment; (c) accelerate pension system reforms, which can play an important role not
only in resource mobilization and providing longer term income security, but also, in expanding the
institutional base for long-term savings instruments; (d) encourage the development and u s e o f innovative
financial products and instruments (such as insurance products, securitization, etc.) to iniprove access to
finance for underserved segments and better manage risks related to natural disasters; and (e) together
with the IMF, helping to keep a watch on financial system stability and potential r i s k s . IFC will continue
to make investments and provide technical assistance to build capacity in private financial institutions that
contribute to financial deepening and expansion o f financial services to underserved segments. IFC will
also continue to support pioneering transactions, such as partial guarantees o f bond issues: i v h i c h w i l l
help develop financial markets. IBRD and IFC may also issue Indian rupee bonds, which ~ v o u l d
contribute to the development o f the long-term bond market.
Lastly, an important development for India’s competitiveness i s h o w India i s emerging as a
150.
global knowledge economy, with great strengths in pharmaceuticals, medical sciences and information
technology. H o w to build o n these strengths i s clearly a strategic challenge for India’s future growth

40

The Bank and WBI are making a modest contribution o n the subject through preparing a Knowledge
Economy Assessment, which can help provide the basis for any additional future support f r o m the Bank
in this area.

Cross-Cutting Environmental Issues
15 1. T o add to an already complex picture, India i s facing the challenge o f growing fast when i t cannot
afford to ignore global climate change and i t s implications. India i s one o f the world’s lowest emitters o f
carbon dioxide (the main greenhouse gas) in terms o f per-capita emissions. However, on an aggregate
basis, with i t s large population, India i s the second highest in emissions amongst developing countries.
The Bank continues to assist Go1 o n issues relating to climate change, including Montreal Protocol
support to phase out production o f ozone-depleting substances, and a proposed major national level study
o n India’s vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. The Bank Group will also seek Tvays to further
expand i t s partnership with India o n national and global issues through programs financed by the GEF,
Montreal Protocol and PCF. The prospects for effective mobilization o f GEF support are stronger than in
recent years, particularly in the area o f renewable energy, given the passage o f the 2003 Electricity A c t
and development o f GoI’s new policy o n rural access.

152. India’s economy i s also highly vulnerable to extreme climate events, such as flooding, droughts,
forest fires and tropical cyclones - which appear to have increased in the magnitude o f losses in the last
few decades and could increase in frequency as the climate changes. Already, along India’s eastern
coast, states are affected by 80 percent o f all cyclones in the region. M o r e than h a l f o f the country i s
vulnerable to earthquakes. W h i l e natural propensity to hazards cannot be avoided, their disastrous
consequences can be minimized through pro-active use o f a variety o f planning measures. Both at the
national and state l e v e l s the need to build capacity for long term disaster management i s recognized.
While public resources have traditionally and principally been used for relief activities, t h e disastrous
losses o f the past several years have brought Go1 to markedly revise the country’s policy orientation
towards natural hazards. F r o m a mostly re-active stance in the past, the Tenth Plan augurs the start o f a
n e w pro-active era, where “the development process needs to be sensitive towards disaster prevention and
mitigation.” With this, the Bank will continue to respond, as i t has in the past (e.&., for the Gujarat
earthquake and AP and Orissa cyclones), to requests for assistance i t may receive in the aftermath o f any
future natural disasters. The Bank i s also engaged in dialogue with Go1 o n disaster preparedness and
would consider a selective lending engagement with the Center in this area o n demand.
153.

The broad environmental agenda that the country needs to pursue, in order to be able to expand
infrastructure, maintain high growth rates and improve the quality o f l i f e in a sustainable fashion, i s
overwhelming. Effectively addressing this agenda requires greater attention to balancing the costs and
benefits and assessing the financial implications of particular initiatives. In addition, innovations in
environmental management, including regulatory reforms that increase the efficiency o f mechanisms for
issuing permits and monitoring compliance, and promote public-private partnerships will be necessary.

154.
Environmental and natural resource concerns essentially cut across all o f the Program Priorities
o f the Bank. The Bank will need to partner with national, state and local governments - and through
them with communities and private sector stakeholders in the follom.ing four strategic areas: (i)
strengthening policies and institutions for environmental management in order to make gro\vtli more
environmentally sustainable; (ii)improving environmental health and overall environmental quality oC
life, particularly for the poorer segments o f the population, focusing o n significant r i s k factors for child
mortality and communicable diseases; (iii)improving livelihoods and reducing the vulnerability o f the
poor, as relates to natural resources and events; and (iv) addressing longer-term concerns to
environmental sustainability o f global and regional scale (the ‘global commons’ agenda) i n a manner that
also produces immediate and tangible local benefits.
41

V.

LENDING, EXPOSURE AND RISKS

Three important developments have led to shifts in the C A S lending volumes and triggers for
155.
FY05-08. Foremost among these i s the international development assistance compact reached at
Monterrey in 2002, and i t s promise to substantially increase development assistance focused on achieving
the MDGs - with recognition that India’s performance i s central to achieving these globally. In addition,
in FY03 and FY04, Go1 made substantial pre-payments o f IBRD currency pool loans, as w e l l as prepayments to ADB and other creditors, which have clearly improved India’s creditworthiness for IBRD
borrowing’. Bank analysis also suggests that the immediate r i s k from sustained fiscal imbalances i s a n
impediment to growth - which i s s t i l l very rapid by international standards - rather than a collapse o f
growth or imminent crisis.

IBRD and IDA Lending. The impact o f first o f these developments o n India’s overrrll IDA
156.
eizvelope will be decided in the context o f the ongoing discussions for I D A - 1 4 . However, it i s evident
that, based o n country performance ratings and India’s absorptive capacity, a substantially higher l e v e l o f
IDA could be effectively utilized by India. Beyond any ceilings that are imposed by the IDA Deputies,
the CAS will not place additional constraints on India’s IDA resources unless a dramatic unforeseen
deterioration in performance warrants a review o f the overall strategy. This represents a shift from the
FY02-04 C A S and i t s designation o f a ‘core’ IDA program for l o w case lending.
157.
Go1 has indicated that i t prefers I D A - o n l y funding to be targeted to projects that directly address
poverty and human development (e.g., rural poverty, education, priority health interventions, etc.) For
adjustment lending, IDA resources will be blended with IBRD on a 1:2 basis during the new strategy
period, compared to the 1: 1 ratio currently employed.
The factors enumerated above (paragraph 155) suggest n new waj* of lookirrg (it IBRD lerrdirrg
158.
Rather than the practice o f establishing l o w or base case scenarios for B a n k lending, and structuring
triggers to shift f i o i n one case to another, under this C A S the Bank program will fail \vithin a 1 ange
limited by an upper bound for IBRD lending to support India’s achievement o f MDGs. Getting to t h i s
upper bound will require strong reform performance as w e l l as a strengthened pace o f project preparation
For FY05-08, the upper bound for IBRD lending i s an average o f US$2.15 b i l l i o n per year

As i s currently the case, the level o f IBRD investment lending to the states will depend on the
159.
pace o f reform implementation and application of ‘self-regulating’ triggers. U n l i k e the recent past.
however, the guidelines for engagement (paragraph 60) will increase the transparency o f the triggers for
state level investment lending and open up opportunities for an increased number o f states to engage n it11
the Bank. These guidelines also specify triggers for investment lending with the Center. Finally. GOT’S
o n n guidelines for adjustinent lending will continue to serve as the primary trigger for state level
ad] ustment lending.
W h i l e the menu o f projects currently under consideration for either IDA or IBRD funding i s
160.
attached as Annex B3, this ‘operations program’ will be updated periodically in discussions between the
Bank and Go1 (see paragraph 169). Some operations will drop out and others that conform to the C A S
framework - in particular the Strategic Principles set out in paragraph 45, and the efforts to engage u ith
the poorest states (paragraphs 55-57) - are expected to be added throughout the C A S period The l e \ e l o f

42

lending achieved within the limit o f India’s IDA allocation (paragraph 156) and the upper bound for
IBRD lending (paragraph 15 8).
161.
Given the v i e w that there i s n o immediate threat to fiscal stability, this CAS, unlike its
predecessor, does n o t suggest a specific fiscal policy trigger. Instead, the Bank will periodically, and at
least annually, review India’s macroeconomic situation and assess the outlook for stability. I f such
review points to a changed outlook and growing risk to macro-economic stability, the Bank would inalte a
recommendation for reduced lending at that time. In addition, the Bank will periodically review the
evolving exposure situation with Go1 in the light o f actual and projected IBRD lending experience.
162.
In the case o f portfolio performance and monitoring, the focus will s h i f t toward implementation
o f portfolio iinprovement measures agreed with Go1 during the FY04 CPPR. These measures include: (i)
a detailed action plan for restructuring the transport, health and rural development portfolios, which are
the m a i n cause o f the recent deterioration o f the portfolio; and (ii)application o f filters for
implementation readiness for new projects. The agreed readiness filters are detailed in the Portfolio
Iinprovement Strategy (Annex 8). The emphasis o f the C A S i s therefore o n India’s o w n pace o f reform
implementation, as w e l l as the pace o f project preparation, to determine lBRD lending volumes within the
upper bound.
163.
IBRD exposure to India i s currently w e l l below the current single country concentration l i m i t of
US$13.5 billion. Assuming that IBRD lending reaches the upper bounds during FYO5-08. and stabilizes
at about US$2 billion a year thereafter, India’s exposure would cross t h i s limit by FY 1 1 h l t e r n a t i ~cly. if
IBRD lending grows more slowly f r o m application o f the self-regulating triggers, and remains closer to
about USS1.5 b i l l i o n a year, exposure would cross the current single country limit only in FY13.

This suggests that the exposure implications o f the proposed lending scenarios are manageable
over the medium term. However, in order to ensure that the potential for breaching the concentration
limit i s considered w e l l in advance, the Bank will carefully review exposure issues during the mid-tenii
164.

review o f the strategy, taking into account the actual lending experience and prevailing policies on
exposure. T o ensure that India’s financing needs f r o m the Bank can be accommodated into the fLiture,
Bank management will also discuss options for long-term exposure management w i t h Go1

165.
In recent years, the Bank has stepped up efforts to better integrate financial products and
instruments in delivering country assistance w o r k in partnership with client governments. Discussions
are currently under way with Go1 to explore working together more closely in this area, with the
possibility o f Bank advisory services to Go1 to ensure the better use o f the full range o f IBRD financial
products for financing and hedging purposes, and also advisory services on domestic and exteiiial debt
management. One possibility could be the use o f currency swaps t o generate rupee financing, which could
be an attractive instrument to eliminate currency risk for some lending to states.
166
Tliree iiiaiii types of risk are seen for the Bankportfolio. These are (1) rislcs related to the
effectiveness o f the Bank support and the possibility o f substantial IDNIBRD lending that does not
translate into adequate development outcomes; (11) the potential for increased r i s k in the India portfolio as
the B a n k shifts towards a renewed emphasis o n infrastructure, including possible engagement in
controversial areas such as hydropower, and (in) the exposure r i s k to IBRD o f the proposed substantial
increase in lending.
167.
Considerable effort i s already being made to mitigate the first two o f these r i s k s Activities
include greater attention to quality at entry and close monitoring o f safeguards issues o n any higher risk
operations Risks w o u l d also be mitigated by only considering support for hydropower in\ estment that
has limited adverse social and environiiieiital iinpact. The guidelines for engagement foi- different

43

categories o f lending are also expected to help ensure that Bank resources are focused o n projects that
take into account the lessons leamed for successful implementation. Finally, as o f FY04, Go1 and the
B a n k are engaging in a joint quarterly portfolio monitoring exercise.
Regarding the exposure risk to IBRD, with regular monitoring o f the macro-economic situation
168.
and application o f the preconditions for the different categories o f lending, IBRD exposure n s l c s are seen
to be acceptable. As an illustration o f this, Annex B7 shows that Bank exposure indicators improve e v e n
i f IBRD lending reaches the upper bound and the economy performs below the fast reforiii scenario. A
simulation based o n the slow reform scenario also shows improvement.

169. An important part o f achieving the expanded level o f lending proposed in the C A S will be
streamlining project preparation. Over the past year, as an offshoot o f C A S preparation, a more
disciplined system has been developed for adding new projects to the pipeline in accordance with tlie
emerging C A S and in agreement with GoI. Periodic monitoring, covering pipeline development as w e l l
as portfolio performance, has been initiated with Go1 as a mechanism to resolve any problems more
quickly and accelerate lending development, including early Go1 approval o f new projects. This has
already yielded a strengthened pipeline for F Y 0 5 (see Annex B 3 for the f L d l indicative operations
program).
170.
IFC Exposure and Risks. India i s IFC’s second largest exposure. As o f June 30,2004, IFC’s
held portfolio in India consisted o f investments in 84 companies, with total exposure o f US$1.14 billion
for IFC’s o w n account and US$167 m i l l i o n for B-loan participants. I F C expects that investment volumes
w i l l continue to be in the range o f US$300-350 m i l l i o n per year through the strategy period, which will
lteep India within IFC‘s exposure l i m i t s .

The main risk to the IFC portfolio would be the inipact o f major changes in macroeconomic
17 1.
conditions, especially a sudden currency depreciation or sharp increase in interest rates. IFC reviews the
potential impact o f such shocks in i t s investment decisions and requires clients to use r i s k mitigation
techniques such as hedging and asset-liability management to reduce the vulnerability o f tlie portfolio to
such shocks.
MIGA guarantees have facilitated approximately US$202.5 m i l l i o n o f FDI into India since the
172.
country joined the agency in 1994. At present, MIGA has n o exposure in India. However, investors are
showing renewed appetite for projects in India, most o f which are in infrastructure (the power sector). All
o f the power projects for which MIGA has been approached are renewable energy projects (including
bioinass and wind farms). In addition, MIGA will continue to focus o n India as a source o f outbound
investments, as part o f i t s South-South strategy.

VI.

IMPLEMENTATION AND MONTTO

173.
Achieving the main objective o f this C A S - a major step up in the Bank’s inipact and delivery in
India - will pose many challenges in the years ahead. Actions are already underway to address these
challenges by strengthening the organization and management o f the country program. Within t l i e Soulh
Asia Region Vice Presidency o f the Bank, management o f the India program i s being realigned to follo\v
a different model than for smaller country programs. T o enable the Bank to move to a higher l e v e l o f
delivery and allow for close interaction with i t s clients, a cadre o f senior staff i s being positioned in t h e
New D e l h i office. Lead Specialist positions have been created in key sectors and sub-sectors in order to
strengthen team leadership and accountability in N e w Delhi, while also improving l i n k s to the networlcs.
In order to provide coordinated support to the growing nuinber o f states w h e r e the Bank w i l l engage,
State Coordinators have also been designated. Strategic oversight and management o f the Bank’s

44

growing program i s also being strengthened in the Country Management Unit, including positioning o f a
Senior Country Manager in Washington.

174. This realignment i s taking place within the context o f an already strong Bank teain that i s highly
decentralized. Since 1997, the India Country Director has been based in the N e w Delhi office and
operational responsibilities have been substantially delegated to an expanded team iii India D ~ i r i i i FY04.
g
more than 44 percent o f all lending, AAA and TA activities were led by Task Managers in India N e w
Delhi i s increasingly used as a hub for regional operations o f the Bank and i s tlie operational base foi
procurement. The present male/female ratio for staff level E and above i s 2: 1 compared to the ratio o f 6 1
in 1996.
175. IFC’s activities in India are managed f r o m a regional hub based in N e w Delhi, with a smaller
office in Mumbai. Together, they are responsible for business development in all sectors and portfolio
supervision o f manufacturing, services and financial sector projects. To ensure that clients benefit from
IFC’s global expertise, country based staff and global staff based in Washington work closely together in
project teams. In addition, some senior international staff are based in Delhi and Mumbai, w h i l e locally
recruited staff are given extensive training at I F C headquarters as w e l l as opportunjties for international
experience. To increase i t s presence in southern India, IFC intends to establish a small ol‘fice in Chennai,
co-located with the IBRD/IDA accounting office and a small SEDF office in Guwahati, Assam for
delivery o f SME programs in North-East India.
Communications and Outreach. As highlighted in the results o f the F Y 0 4 India Client Survey
176.
(summarized in Annex 3), an increasingly important part o f program iinpleinentation i s the Bank’s
strategy for communications and outreach. The Bank has developed a multilayered strategy aiiiied at
disseiiiinating global knowledge and improving the quality o f operations by explaining tlie challenges o f
development to external audiences and gaining the cooperation o f stakeholders. The Bank will also
continue to gather the lessons learned from Bank Group operations and focus during FYOS-OS on
disseminating these lessons more broadly and o n a regular basis.

177. The elements o f this strategy include active engagement with both national and state-level media
and c i v i l society; maintaining four country-specific websites in English, Hindi, Kannada and Telugu;
providing translations in the relevant language o f all press releases, summaries o f most reports, and full
text o f major reports where possible; maintaining a database o f more than 4,000 external contacts; and
producing a quarterly newsletter and other print and electronic dissemination products.
A major current initiative i s transforming the Public Inforiiiation Center (PIC) from a passive
178.
library into a center for discussion and debate on developiiient issues. This i s being done at three l e v e l s :
conversion o f the N e w Delhi Office library and PIC into an audio-visual center with state o f the art
presentation and conferencing equipment and a wealth o f electronic resources; establishing partnerships
with other libraries and academic institutions outside Delhi to disseminate works on development and
conduct events for their own audiences; and activating the network o f depository libraries attached to the
Office o f the Publisher. When IFC opens i t s SEDF office in Assam, i t will also likely combine a
knowledge center for SMEs with a broader Bank Group PIC.

179.
Aspects o f coiiiiiiunications are increasingly being mainstreaiiied into operations. R it11
coiiiiiiunication and luiowledge strategies n o w routinely part o f the upfront dialogue with borrowers and
built into project design. Internally, management and staff are paying greater attention to understanding
the motivations o f interest groups and the role o f infomial relationships and institutions through sector
and state-specific political economy analyses that are helping improve t h e design and feasibility o f their
interventions.

Monitoring the CAS. The appropriateness o f this strategy will ultimately be measured by t h e
B a n k Group contribution to India’s achievement o f i t s development goals. Monitoring will t a l e placc
both at the individual project and report level, and at the level o f the overall assistance program. Sonie o f
the indicators that will be used to monitor the effectiveness o f the overall Bank Group contribution are
provided in the FY05-08 Country Strategy Outcomes M a t r i x (Annex 4). Management and staff \vi11
review progress against these proposed outcomes and indicators in a midterm review o f the CAS,
currently anticipated for discussion by the Board in early F Y 0 7 . In the unlikely event that the Bank‘s
regular monitoring (paragraph 16 1) indicates a significant deterioration in India’s macroeconomic
stability or creditworthiness for Bank lending, management will directly advise the Board o f any shifts
proposed for the India and W o r l d Bank partnership, including any reduction in the ceiling for lending.

Implementation o f the FY02-04 CAS
Country: INDIA

Date o f CAS:
Date o f Progress Report(s):

June 2001
December 2002
July 2001 to June 2004

Period Covered by the CAS (and this Note):
BACKGROUND

1.
This Note assesses some o f the main elements o f the Bank Group contribution to India’s
development during implementation o f the FY02-04 C A S (July 2001 to June 2004). The assessment has
been completed as a self-evaluation by staff and management working o n India operations (“the Country
Team”), and i s intended to supplement the more detailed C A S Progress Report o f December 2002. The
latest broad assessment o f India’s development progress can be found in the 2003 Development Policy
Review (DPR).
2.

Given that the India program i s one o f the largest and most diverse programs o f the Bank Group,
i t i s not possible to assess the full impact and delivery o f the entire program in a short note; hence this

review necessarily leaves a l o t out in regard t o the Bank’s contribution, and focuses only o n some o f the
key aspects o f the strategy.

The FY02-04 C A S (hereinafter simply “the CAS”) was set within the framework o f India’s o w n
3.
strategy for poverty reduction, the fundamental elements o f which were contained in GoI’s Ninth FiveYear Plan (1997 t o 2002) and reflected in GoI’s Mid-Term Appraisal o f October 2000. At the t i m e o f the
C A S Progress Report, a draft Tenth Five-Year Plan (2003-2008) was also under preparation by the
Planning Commission. The CAS defined the Bank Group’s program o f assistance around the Ninth Plan
themes o f (i)
strengthening the enabling environment for growth; and (ii)
supporting critical interventions
o f special benefit to the poor and disadvantaged.

4.
Within these broad themes, the C A S set out three Strategic Principles that were intended to
guide Bank Group support - (i)
exercising selectivity with B a n k assistance; (ii)
working increasingly
throughpartizerslzips; and (iii)
using a prograinnzatic approach to maximize the impact o f Bank Group
assistance for poverty reduction in India. These three Strategic Principles would cut across all o f Bank
Group activities, regardless o f the sectors or program areas in which the B a n k Group and Go1 focused our
engagement. In reviewing the CAS, this Note will use the three Strategic Principles as a lens through
which to review B a n k Group performance during FY02-04. The next six sections o f the Note provide an
assessment o f progress against each o f the Strategic Principles (Sections 1 - 3), along with a discussion o f
the final outturn for the m a i n aspects o f Bank Group support - the ongoing portfolio (Section 4), triggers,
n e w lending and investments (Section 5) and AAA (Section 6).

1.

SELECTIVITY

5.
The C A S argued that selectivity i s especially important in a country as large and as fLll o f
potential as India: “There is a need to focus, not just on what is important, but also on where Bank
Group assistance can have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. In order to maximize the impact o f
B a n k assistance o n India’s efforts towards poverty reduction, selectivity w o u l d be exercised by:

T h e ‘focus state’ experience

6.
Since 1997, Bank Group strategy has been to engage primarily at the state level in India, with
knowledge resources and financing geared towards reform - reflecting that many o f the structural and
fiscal reforms required to accelerate India’s growth and reduce poverty are in the domain o f the states and
that a good h a l f o f India’s high fiscal deficits come f r o m the states. An important thrust o f the Bank
strategy has been to focus i t s support o n India’s leading reform states in order to create demonstration
effects that might stimulate reforms across other states. An important part o f the rationale for this
approach was a view that comprehensive support across key sectors was more likely to yield sustainable
positive development outcomes than a more sector driven approach.
The B a n k Group maintained an intensive engagement with three focus states - AF’ (since 1997),
7.
UP (since 1998) and Kamataka (since 2000) - during the C A S period. With a combined population o f
about 300 million, these three states account for 30 percent o f the poor and 29 percent o f out-of-school
children in India. Adjustment and investment lending for these states was proposed to be about 40
percent o f n e w commitments over the C A S period (and a larger, but undefined share o f state-level

lending, depending on the volume o f lending for central government projects). By building o n a
foundation o f dialogue and partnership with these states, the Bank offered adjustment lending support for
comprehensive fiscal, governance and power sector reform programs, combined with investments in
sectors that are critical to poverty reduction - such as forestry, infrastructure, water resource management
and selected anti-poverty interventions (both rural and urban). By the end o f the period, actual lending
for the three states was US$1.756 billion, or about 34 percent o f total lending and 44 percent o f state level
lending.

8.

O f the lending that was approved for the three states, about 2/3 went to investment projects and
1/3 supported cross-cutting reforms through adjustment lending. Though an adjustment lending program
o f up to US$2.150 billion in loansicredits had initially been considered for the three focus states plus the
state o f Orissa during the C A S period, due to delays in reform implementation, often in the power sector
(which has a strong impact o n each state’s fiscal outlook), only three operations totaling USS570 m i l l i o n
were approved by the end o f FY04.
The B a n k seems to have done well in sending a consistent signal o n the link between adjustment
9.
lending and progress in reforms. In particular, when reforms went o f f track in UP early in the C A S
period, in line with the strategy the Bank discontinued processing o f the state’s second adjustment
operation. During the second h a l f o f the C A S period, four important state adjustment operations (AP
S A L 11, Kamataka Economic R e f o m L o a n 111, Orissa S A L Iand T a m i l N a d u S A L I),
w i t h a planned
total value o f about US$850 m i l l i o n in loadcredits, were substantially completed but then delayed by
weaknesses in reform implementation in each state. The A P S A L I1eventually moved forward and was
approved in late-FY04; i t i s s t i l l to be determined whether others will proceed in FY05.

10.
I t i s however, perhaps also the case that the Bank underestimated the volatility o f the state level
reform process in India, with often broad forward movement also marked by substantial policy delays
and; sometimes, setbacks. Such volatility does not necessarily bring into question adjustment support to
states that are undertaking comprehensive refomis (instead underlining the importance o f a clear link
between lending and performance o n reform implementation, and the need for a prudent approach in
determining loan sizes, including back-loading o f successive loans.) I t does, however, suggest a need to
reconsider the rationale for concentrating slower-disbursing investment lending in such states, given the
non-negligible risk that a comprehensive reform process can go off-track. While i t i s natural that states
Page 2 of 16

engaged in adjustment programs would also qualify under the entry criteria for investment lending. and
there can be synergies between the two, i t can also be argued that, given the variable speed o f reform
across states and sectors, the Bank should be more willing to support important sector reforms 111 any
state.

11.

Investment lending to the three focus states ultimately accounted for about 35 percent o f total
state level investment lending, and spanned several o f the key sectors o f the CAS. In UP, new lending
had an infrastructure focus -with financing for a state roads project and a state water resources
management project that also entails a substantial reform agenda. Lending to Kamataka was entirely in
the water sector - rural water supply and sanitation, tank management and urban water supply and
sanitation improvement. AP received investment financing for two projects targeting rural poverty - in
community forestry and rural poverty reduction. Attachment 1 provides a summary o f the final FY02-04
lending program.
The picture i s more marked for the AAA program, which concentrated substantial resources in
12.
the three states, often in close partnership with the state government and other stakeholders. This
included broad support for translating A P ’ s “Vision 2020” planning exercise into implementation including non-lending TA for improved poverty and social monitoring and environmental management,
plus preparation o f strategies for growth and for the health, nutrition and population sectors, among
others. In Kamataka, Bank advisory support was also extensive, comprising w o r k in the education sector
(e.g., on education financing), dialogue o n power sector r e f o m i and notes on rural policies and
agricultural risk management. For UP, a limited dialogue on reform, and TA for poverty monitoring and
social analysis, and for environmental management followed the withdrawal o f adjustment lending.
Recently, the state has also indicated i t s interest in resuming a more intensive dialogue o n cross-cutting
reforms. An update to the AAA program listed in the Progress Report i s provided in Attachment 2.
13.
In terms o f the outcomes achieved with Bank support, the Progress Report noted that the
performance o f the focus states, in terms o f various economic and social indicators, was encouraging.
Growth prospects had improved, poverty levels had declined and k e y social indicators critical to India’s
attainment o f the MDGs had either improved or their deterioration has been arrested in all three states.
However, i t was also argued that i t would be presumptuous to assume that Bank programs could have a
determinant impact on growth, poverty and the MDGs, given the long lead times for policies and
programs to translate into outcomes, the relatively recent adoption o f the focus state approach, and the
fact that Bank lending has been o n average less than one percent o f the output o f the states.

14.
F o r states that undertook adjustment programs, there has also been evidence o f progress in both
fiscal and govemance aspects o f their reform programs. This includes a reduction in the ratio o f
consolidated deficit to Gross State Domestic Product in a l l S A L states, as w e l l improvements in revenue
generation. The benefits appear to have gone beyond fiscal adjustment, w i t h S A L states ahead o f nonS A L states in privatizing public enterprises and in elements o f power sector reform. Some evidence also
points to higher credit ratings for S A L states and the beginnings o f improvement in service delivery. As
noted in the Progress Report, the sustainability o f fiscal and governance reforms may be key to further
accelerating economic growth and reducing poverty in these states.
The Bank’s support to cross-cutting reform programs in the focus states also generated a great
15.
deal o f interest f r o m other states. In two cases (Orissa and T a m i l Nadu), this interest l e d to agreement in
principle with Go1 to move towards adjustment lending in these additional states. I n other cases
(Maharashtra, Punjab and Bihar), i t was agreed instead that the Bank should provide analytical support
for cross-cutting reforms. This was consistent w i t h the CAS, which had envisaged the likelihood o f
adding additional focus states. The Bank also played a role in mobilizing states to share and disseminate
their reform experiences - although this i s an area where more still needs to be done.

Selective Interventions in other states - Unusual sector merit
Besides the concentrated partnership with a relatively small number o f focus states, the C A S
16.
proposed support to other states for projects that demonstrated ‘unusual sector merit’. Activities would be
justified by (i)having an unusually high development or demonstration impact due to their innovation or
the importance o f the reform being supported; (ii)
extending support to the social sectors in India’s
poorest states, as long as i t could be used effectively; or (iii)
being in states which are not focus states o f
the Bank but are nevertheless reforming in a key sector. As defined, these categories created a fairly
broad framework for considering whether a state proposal merited Bank support - with less guidance o n
h o w the B a n k should narrow the choice o f operations and exercise selectivity in such states.
17.

In FY02-04, operations in this area o f the strategy included:
Three state road projects in Kerala, Tamil N a d u and Mizorain
A large and innovative urban transport project in Muinbai (Maharashtra)
Projects to restructure the water sector and reform the state health system in Rajasthan
A rural poverty project in Chhattisgarh
Projects to improve rural water supply and sanitation in Maharastra and watershed management
in the n e w state o f Uttaranchal; and
A major B a n k response to the Gujarat earthquake, with restructuring o f existing projects and a
n e w credit for relief and reconstruction (together amounting to U S 7 0 0 m i l l i o n o f IDA)

18.
M a n y o f these operations, along with the in-depth assistance to the focus states, and additional
AAA to the states and Go1 (as described below), have contributed to the benchmarks and ‘progress

indicators’ that the Country Team had established at the outset o f the C A S period. The C A S Progress
Report had provided a detailed status report o n these benchmarks. Attachment 3 to this annex updates the
information provided at that time and gives some indication as to where the Bank may have had an impact
(albeit, with the same caveat o f the Progress Report that Bank support i s usually a very small part o f a
state’s economy).

19.
Notably absent f r o m the lending operations list, as w e l l as the progress indicators, i s Bank
investment lending to the power sector - which had been projected in the C A S to account for up t o
USl.35 b i l l i o n of IBRD lending. Though the C A S had proposed a strong program o f support for
reforming this critical sector at the state level, and a series o f state power sector reform loans - for Orissa,
Haryana, AP Rajasthan and UP - had been developed, in the end, when the reforms were not realized, the
Bank was forced to bring an end to this series. While illustrating the difficulties that reforms can face in
India, this also shows that attention to selectivity, and the proposal o f the C A S to finance primarily the
implementation of critical reforms (i.e. to apply ‘self-regulating triggers’ as discussed in Section 5), was
maintained. Through FY03 and FY04 the Bank undertook a detailed analysis o f i t s early experience with
supporting power reform attempts at the state level, and through dialogue with Go1 and key states, has
developed a n e w set o f guidelines for Bank engagement in the sector which are reflected in the FYOS-08
CAS.
20
Reforms in the state urbaii sector w e r e also slower than anticipated - leading to lower IBRD
lending volumes given that several operations had initially been expected With the investment lending
delays, the Bank has instead been engaged in dialogue on regulatory reform o f land use, anal) s i s o f the
GoI’s reform instruments, notably the Urban Reform Incentive Fund. subsidies to the poor in slum
programs and an analysis o f various constraints and reform measures related to land markets.

In addition, preparation o f a new/second generation o f health systems projects that build on the
lessons learned f r o m the major health sector study completed in June 2001 (Section 6) have taken longer
to reach fruition. Only the Rajasthan Health Systems project was approved during FY02-04, although
preparation i s n o w underway for other states.
Support at the Center

The C A S recognized the need to balance the state focus with a strong but selective program of
22.
support at the Center. In terms o f Bank lending, this meant support for development o f a national
highway system and for combating infectious disease, including HIVIAIDs. Non-lending support in the
f o r m o f TA, dissemination o f AAA and dialogue would be targeted towards (i)
agriculture and rural
fiscal and governance reforms; (iii)
financial sector development; and (iv) health sector
development; (ii)
reforms at the national level.

23.
In l i n e with the CAS, the B a n k financed development o f India’s national highways with a new
lending operation for the Allahabad Bypass (a US$589 m. loan for Grand Trunk Roads, planned for
FY02, was also advanced into FYO1, just prior to the C A S period.) The outcomes ofrefom-based
lending in this area have generally been positive, with much o f the work traditionally undertaken by the
public sector n o w outsourced to the private sector, regardless o f the source o f funding. India has been
able to attract a limited number o f international f i r m s to compete for and take up large highway
construction contracts and thereby help bridge the growing gap between demand and supply for
construction industry capacity. However, recently some concerns have been raised about the efficiency
and degree o f competition in highways procurement; contract implementation and management in the
road sector; these are currently being j o i n t l y examined further by the Government, the state authorities
and the Bank. The National Highways Authority o f India i s also putting in place mechanisms such as user
surveys and a stakeholder forum to provide a means for road users’ views to be articulated.
24.
The Bank also supported GoI’s programs for combating infectious diseases, with implenientation
o f the A I D S I1operation as well as a quick Bank response to the resurgence o f wild polio cases across
several states in 2002 - in part with a supplemental credit to finance polio vaccine and strengthen GoI’s
polio eradication program. By contrast, the national level dialogue and TA that the C A S had envisaged,
based o n a major AAA completed o n public and private roles in health care, did not materialize on a
significant scale. Similarly, though I F C committed long t e r m financing to a private health care provider
to build the first integrated health care delivery network in N e w Delhi, other investments to improve the
quality o f private health care services were limited during FY02-04.
25.
As proposed, important analytical w o r k and policy advice was provided in agriculture and rural
development, w i t h a major Agricultural Policy Review n o w completed and under discussion. In financial
sector development, Bank Group assistance has clearly exceeded that envisioned at the outset o f the CAS.
Considerable demand-driven non-lending support was provided, including a study o n I m p r o \ i n g Access
to Rural Finance; a series o f policy notes o n capital markets, banking reforms, the management o f nonperforming assets, revitalizing non-bank financial institutions and finance for small and medium
enterprises; TA on pension reforms and a Corporate Governance ROSC. The second o f t w o high-level
financial sector conferences, both o f which were co-sponsored by the B a n k in partnership with GoI, w a s
also held just recently in N e w Delhi.
2.

PARTNERSHIPS A A D OUTREACll

26.
The C A S recognized that using the Bank Group’s limited resources effectively and n i t h catalytic
impact, requires partnership with Bank Group’s clients and other donors and stakeholders, based on a

Page 5 o J l 6

shared vision and principles. While Go1 i s the Bank Group’s principal partner, additional partnerships
were expected to be pursued with i t s support. The Progress Report had already found considerable
success in building partnerships with key players - from Go1 and reforming state governments to the
private sector, c i v i l society, external donors and investors:
Partnersliips with other official external financiers

27.
Partnerships have proven to be very valuable at the state level, particularly with agencies utilizing
a similar state focus state approach as the Bank. F o r instance, in Karnataka the Bank worked closely w i t h
U S A I D . In AP and Orissa, the Bank and DFID provided complementary technical assistance and cofinanced adjustment programs to support comprehensive fiscal, governance and power sector reforms.
While the overall relationship with donors has been greatly strengthened and deepened by such state l e v e l
partnerships, this has not always meant full agreement (e.g., DFID and the B a n k having different views
on the likely pace o f Orissa’s reform progress).
28.
In addition, DFID provided the Bank with trust funds o f about US$5.8 m i l l i o n in an innovative
partnership geared towards extending Bank support for state reforms that could lead to lasting poverty
reduction. This trust fund enabled the Bank to not only intensify i t s assistance to existing partner states,
but expand i t s support to new states that were coming forward for a dialogue o n the reform process (e.g.,
helping to finance Bank w o r k in Orissa and Tamil Nadu).
29.
M o r e generally, at the sectoral level, partnering w i t h other external financiers has also been
beneficial. There has been close collaboration with donors in most sectors including, energy (ADB,
JBIC, DFID, U S A I D , KfW, CIDA), health and nutrition (namely U S A I D , WHO, EC, DFID, concerned
UN Agencies, CDC, A U S A I D , ILO, and other institutions including the Gates Foundation), and small
and medium enterprises financing (DFID, KfW, GTZ and IFC). In addition:
While Japan PHRD grants were a useful source o f support for preparation o f some projects, India
perhaps underutilized PHRD grants relative to other countries and given the size o f i t s lending
engagement with the Bank.
In June 2001, ADB, the Bank and Go1 completed a Coordinated Assistance Strategy for roads,
focusing o n state and national highways. This assistance strategy has been under implementation,
The Bank and ADB also coordinate in other sectors, including inland and coastal waterways and
energy; potential areas for collaboration that are currently under discussion include rural roads and
national highways financing.

In the context o f the donor funded Water and Sanitation Program, the B a n k collaborates w i t h DFID,
SIDA, the Netherlands and other donors in a range o f activities including rural and urban water
supply, with a formal partnership with the Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission and decentralization
activities such as the C i t y Challenge Fund.

M o r e recently, at the suggestion o f DFID, the Bank and DFID India signed a strategic partnership
agreement in April 2004, w h i c h will provide a broad context to the institutions’ cooperation in India:
in support o f the GoI’s development agenda.

IFC developed close working relationships with donors investing in private sector projects. IFC coinvested with ADB in private health care and infrastructure projects and with DEG and FMO in the
general manufacturing and infrastructure sectors.

30.
An important development during the C A S period was the Go1 decision to discontinue receiving
bilateral funds directly from all but six o f the major donor agencies. With this shift, the Bank has lost
some valuable partners in India, with a result being that we have n o w fewer donor partners to work with.
Another n e w development o f the C A S has been the possibility o f using sector-wide approaches (SWAps)
as a way to work more closely with donors, by pooling our resources to help improve and strengthen
existing government programs and systems.
Partnerships for the Global Eiivirorzmeiit

3 1.
The Bank and India continued a partnership with the GEF and Montreal Protocol, including
support o n issues related to climate change and the world’s second largest program to eliminate the
production and use o f ozone-depleting substances. During the C A S period, this included implementation
o f t w o active projects and substantial development o f an additional operation for Montreal Protocol
support to phasing out ozone-depleting substances. The outcomes o f this support to date include: i)
phase-out o f over 5000 metric tons o f ozone-depleting substances, therefore allowing India to continue to
meet i t s Montreal Protocol targets; ii)reduction in ODS production o f 40 percent when measured against
the 1999 production baseline; and iii)mobilization o f an additional USSSO m i l l i o n for the phase-out o f
carbon tetrachloride, another ODs, bringing the total grant assistance to India o n Montreal Protocol to
about US$180 million.
32.
The ongoing GEF portfolio has focused o n expanding the Bank’s ongoing experience and
learning in community based biodiversity conservation and rural renewable energy. However, during the
C A S period, only one new GEF operation - a U S $ l m . Bio-safety project (which i s expected to improve
GoI’s capacity to deal with bio-safety concerns) - was approved. W o r k with KfW o n proposed GEF
support for the Mathania solar thermal power generation has been less promising. Analysis o f the
economics o f this project, in collaboration with KfW, has raised concerns about i t s econoniic viability and
environmental benefits; discussions are ongoing.
33.
Overall, while there were useful interventions by global environment programs during the CAS
period, India’s participation in these programs v i a the B a n k has been quite l o w relative to other large
countries. F o r potential GEF support to renewable energy programs, the broader policy environment in
the power sector has historically n o t been conducive to efficient mobilization o f renewables, in particular
for mobilizing renewables to expand access in a sustainable way. Hence an interval o f re-evaluation and
‘scaling back’ o f GEF initiatives in the power sector characterized much o f the CAS period. With the
passage o f the 2003 Electricity A c t at the national level in India, and development o f GoI’s new policy o n
rural access, the prospects for effective mobilization o f GEF support are looking better. Similarly, the
lower level o f n e w Bank support to the forestry sector during FY02-04 reduced the opportunity for
mainstreaming global biodiversity programs within the B a n k w o r k in India. Finally, during FY02-04
analysis was initiated o n the potential for use o f carbon finance. In each o f these areas, there appears to
be greater potential for engagement in the future.
Scnling tip
34.

The C A S recognized that ’scaling up’ i s essential for the Bank Group to have an impact in India.

I t emphasized that the Bank should w o r k in tandem w i t h partners where possible, and look broadly for

successful experiments, whether piloted by government, bilateral donors, multilateral agencies or others,
and seek t o use i t s resources to help scale up these successful initiatives. The Bank i t s e l f could pilot
successful innovations, with the objective o f providing lessons that Go1 could then scale up.

35.
Overall, scaling up has continued to present a challenge for the Bank in India. Despite a fair
amount o f progress in gathering lessons learned and defining sector strategies that can build o n these
Page 7 oJ 16

lessons, it i s too early to say that the Bank has successfully translated these strategies into a major scale
up o f i t s work across even a few sectors.

A very good recent example o f scaling up, however, i s support for GoI's national prograin to
36.
universalize elementary education. Following f r o m a series o f primary education (District Primary
Education Program, or DPEP) projects that were supported by the Bank and implemented during the CAS
period, the C A S also highlighted the potential to build o n the design and success o f DPEP and support a
major national scheme to cover the post-primary (elementary) stage o f education. As with DPEP, which
had been supported jointly by five donors, support in this area could have greater reach and impact if
provided in concert with other financiers.

37.
While B a n k and other donor support t o the nationwide elementary education program (SSA) was
delayed relative to the timing envisioned by the CAS, i t was ultimately achieved in a very promising
fashion, with a new vehicle for partnerships - the first SWAP in India - enabling the Bank, DFID and the
European Commission to work in tandem to support this major initiative o f GoI. The SWAp, utilizing a
USS500 m. IDA credit, has potentially set a path for further scaling up in the next f e w years.
Outreach to a broad range of stakeholders

38.
During the period, consultations outside o f govemment circles o n B a n k policy grew in
importance. T o provide just a few examples: national and regional-level consultations were held on the
revision o f the policy o n indigenous peoples, The Bank also actively engaged c i v i l society in preparation
and implementation o f a broad spectrum o f projects-ne
o f the more interesting cases being the
partnership with the Society for Promotion o f Area Resource Centers in ensuring the rights o f railway
slum dwellers within the M u m b a i Urban Transport Project. N G O s and c i v i l society organizations were
closely integrated into the implementation o f the Gujarat Earthquake Recovery Program, leading to the
effective community participation and monitoring o f the reconstruction program.

39.
In addition, the Bank Group has worked much more closely with private sector associations and
local policy and research institutions and 'think tanks' - partnering w i t h the Confederation o f Indian
Industry to analyze and disseminate information on improving the investment climate and brainstorm on
the Bank Group strategy for private sector development; with the National Council for Applied Economic
Research to undertake analytical w o r k o n access to rural finance and to examine labor adjustment issues
in the context o f privatization; with the Indian Council for Research o n International Economic Relations
and the National Institute o f Bank Management t o organize the conferences o n financial sector reforms
mentioned in paragraph 25 above; and w i t h the National Institute o f Public Finance Policy on
strengthening capacity for fiscal management.
40.

The Bank Group also made a special effort to improve i t s outreach in the states in which it was
most active, resulting in the creation o f websites in Hindi, Kannada and Telugu, setting up satellite public
information centers in partnership with the British Council in Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Bangalore,
increasing the volume o f i t s translated dissemination material, and enhancing i t s media and c i v i l society
contacts and level o f engagement with important states. The findings o f the recent Client Survey for India
s t i l l point to a relatively l o w level o f familiarity for the Bank in India compared to other countries. While
this i s not surprising given India's size and the Bank's relative place in it, a strategy to build a network o f
public information centers and expand the Bank's outreach i s currently under implementation.

3.

PROGRAMMATICAPPROACH

The C A S emphasized that the B a n k should think o f its support and goals in India over the longer
41.
term, with change taking place over a period o f many years rather than ovemight. Increasingly, therefore,

Page 8 oJI6

the Bank strategy was to take a Programmatic approach towards support to India, be i t at t h e Center or in
the states, using different instruments depending o n the nature and content o f the programs pursued:
e
e

Using Programmatic instruineizts - such as Programnzatic Structural Adjustment Loans (PSALsJ,
Adaptable Program Loans (APLs) and a ‘programmatic approach’ to investment leiiding;
Mainstreaming environmental and social considerations; and
Strengtheningfiduciary safeguards.

Using Programmatic Instrtimerzts

42.

Adjustment lending instruments generally worked w e l l at the state level, though formal PSALs
were not used as planned in the CAS, the model used was a single tranche S A L w i t h a three year policy
matrix and triggers identified upfront for the following S A L . SALs were designed and iinpleniented as
somewhat flexible and adaptive approaches -though s t i l l requiring that B a n k support for reform fall
within a long term time vision owned by the state. S A L s were offered to the states as a means o f
providing predictable performance-based budget support, enabling states to restore their financial
equilibrium while undertaking reforms.

APLs, w h i c h were seen at the outset o f the CAS t o be well-suited to support for power sector
43.
reforms in the states (as had been the case in Haryana and Ap during the previous C A S period) were
ultimately not followed through. For the two power APLs, i t proved impossible to disburse beyond the
first in the series once the two states decided not to follow through w i t h privatization. M o r e generally,
given the fairly unpredictable policy environment, and the complex way in which policy and institutional
reforms have played out in the sector, there has been concem about malting upfroiit judgments on the
triggers that w o u l d be suitable for all o f the subsequent APLs. Standard sector investment loans have
been seen to offer greater ability to adapt, without imposing substantially different processing transaction
costs.
Mainstreaming eiavironmeiatnl niid social considerations
The CAS aimed to support the fundamental goals o f gender equity, social de\elopinent and
44
environmental protection and improvement, by focusing o n integrating actions in these areas with various
sectoral programs. Some important w o r k was done in this area, paving the w a y for scaling up during the
next C A S period.

45.

T o better mainstream gender issues, Go1 expanded piloting o f the Bank financed Rural Woinen’s
Development and Empowerment Project to a total o f 57 districts in nine states and has begun assessing
implementation in order to consider design options for future operations involving women’s groups.
Partner agencies are reviewing the effectiveness o f existing designs and identifying the factors that are
critical for scaling up and sustainability.

46.
For social r i s k s and opportunities such as resettlement and tribal development, some basic
common principles have also begun to emerge in India. Go1 recently gazetted a National Resettlement &
Rehabilitation policy (only the second country in the region to adopt a resettlement policy, after Sri
Lanka) and has released a draft national tribal policy for public comment.

As agreements o n managing social (and environmental) risks are reached, the dialogue i s
47.
increasingly shifting to improving accountability for results. F o r example, six Bank-supported projects
are piloting participatory monitoring and learning, integrated w i t h the existing monitoring systems, in
order to achieve better accountability to the poor and more equitable management o f natural resources.
The pilots are experimenting with alternative ways to improve the quality o f project implementation. One
Page 9 os16

example i s the creation o f multi-stakeholder working groups that bring together, o n a regular basis,
project stakeholders with a diversity o f perspectives o n project performance in order to learn from each
other’s experiences.
48.
In mainstreaming environmental considerations, two projects to strengthen the performance o f
environmental institutions were completed, leading to visible improvements in the performance o f the
state Pollution Control Boards and improved effectiveness o f the environmental clearance process. The
Bank worked pro-actively with selected environmentally sensitive infrastructure sectors in which it i s
engaged, t o help integrate “best practices” in environmental due diligence, including the instrument o f
strategic environmental assessment (SEA). The prime example i s the highway sector, but other examples
are pilot SEAS for a river basin in Tamil N a d u and the power sector in Karnataka. Studies o f long-term
environmental issues in the power sectors o f Kamataka and Rajasthan were also completed and advice
was provided t o the Ministry for Road Transport and Highways o n developing an enhanced vehicular
emissions inspection program. Substantial analytical w o r k has been undertaken to understand the status
and causes o f indoor and urban air pollution and identify the mix o f multi-sectoral interventions needed to
address these issues.
49.
At the state level, TA provided to Kamataka and UP focused o n building state-level capacity to
systematically collect and analyze environmental information, set priorities in a participatory manner and
facilitate environmental reporting and action planning by various sectors. Karnataka’s first State o f the
Environment Report, supported by Bank TA, was released on International Environment D a y (June 5)
2004.

50.
IFC used i t s financing to help clients implement sustainable business practices through a range o f
iiistruinents/activities, including use o f carbon credits to reduce environmental impacts, development o f
f a m i forestry p r o g r a m and cogeneration plants, and investment in cominunity development. For
example, the IFC-managed Carbon Facility finalized the terms for a contract with an existing I F C client -

a sugar mill, to purchase carbon credits worth over US$9 m i l l i o n that will be generated by the company’s
use o f sugarcane waste to generate electricity for export to the grid. IFC investments in two paper
manufacturers were used to further the development o f the companies’ farm forestry programs that i n turn
will have a positive impact o n the welfare o f local communities and provide additional income for
subsistence farmers. In another case, IFC advised the country’s leading manufacturer o f specialized steel
wires and ropes to set up a cogeneration power plant to reduce emissions and lower power costs by using
waste flue gases.
Strengthening Fiduciary safeguards

5 1.
Fiduciary safeguards also take o n an increased importance within a programmatic approach, as
the focus shifts f r o m ring-fencing projects to ensuring sound financial practices across government. In
this area, considerable progress was made during FY02-04. The country team completed a CPAR, with
the first phase covering the central government, the second phase covering three states (UP, Karnataka
and T a m i l Nadu) and the third phase covering central public enterprises. At the state level, findings are
being translated into action (for example in Karnataka) and have been disseminated in several other states
leading to more state-level procurement studies (Maharashtra and AP).
52.
W h i l e the C A S had proposed a CFAA in FY02, i t was later decided to begin with a few SFAAs
that could help to better define the issues and frame the focus for a future CFAA. The Bank coiiipleted
SFAAs in UP, Karnataka and Orissa. In addition, the B a n k assisted the Government o f AP with capacity
building for i t s o w n preparation o f an S F A A . All o f this w o r k has served to directly support recent Bank
lending as w e l l as help to strengthen state systems into the future.

THE ONGOING PORTFOLIO

For the ongoing Bankportfolio, Bank portfolio performance declined in F Y 0 3 after five years o f
53.
sustained improvement in most quality indicators. Results in F Y 0 4 were mixed, after a number o f
improvement actions were taken o n projects that were either slow disbursing or closing in F Y 0 4 with
large un-disbursedbalances. These actions resulted in an improvement in the disbursement ratio, but also
in an increase in the riskiness rating o f the portfolio.
54.
While India’s disbursement ratio has improved f r o m 17.7 percent in F Y 0 3 to 19.9 percent in
FY04, i t i s s t i l l below the Bank average o f 2 1.4 percent and the ratio o f other large borrowers such as
China (22.7 percent) and Indonesia (27.2 percent). During the C A S period the ratio varied from a high o f
20.9 percent in F Y 0 2 to a l o w o f 17.7 percent in FY03. At current implementation and disbursement
rates, none o f the ongoing projects in the portfolio can be completed within the 5-year implementation
period which has been the business standard for Bank projects in the South Asia region. M a n y o f these
projects had clearly not been ready for implementation at approval, and experienced l o w disbursements in
the first year or two. The causes o f slow disbursements include a weakening o f project readiness for
implementation, the capacity constraints o f implementing agencies and private sector contractors, a
weakening o f supervision quality and oversight, and often a lack o f decisive actions to re-allocate,
restructure or cancel unused funds. In order to reverse this trend, a comprehensive .Portfolio Improvement
Strategy was developed and agreed with GoI. Implementation o f the strategy started during F Y 0 4 and
will continue into F Y 0 5 and beyond. Details on the strategy are provided in the F Y 0 4 CPPR and in
Annex 8.
During July-April 2004, GoI’s Department o f Economic Affairs (DEA) and the Bank finalized
55.
and agreed o n the CPPR. Sector Portfolio Performance Reviews (SPPRs) for Rural Development, Health,
Education, Poverty Reduction and Econoiiiic Management, and Transport were completed, during which
DEA, the Bank and the project authorities systematically discussed some 35 projects, and a detailed
project-by-project action plan was developed and implemented. As a result o f the SPPRs; a backlog o f
US$222 m i l l i o n o f expenditure claims pending with Go1 were processed. Scorecards were used by DEA
and State Chief Secretaries to take corrective actions to deal with under-performing projects in their
respective states. Training courses o n Bank operations and portfolio management were conducted in the
New D e l h i Office for B a n k staff and Go1 representatives. A state portfolio perfonnance review was also
completed for UP. These concerted efforts resulted in a remarkable jump in the disbursement ratio for the
India program by almost 9 percentage points injust 4 months (March-June), f r o m 10.8 percent in endFebruary to the end-June figure o f 19.9 percent, exceeding the F Y 0 4 target o f 17 percent. However, as a
result o f more candid reporting and proactive portfolio management by B a n k staff, w h i c h i s reflected in
end-FY04 realism and proactivity indices o f 90 percent and 83 percent, the percentage o f projects-at-risk
and the amount o f commitments-at-risk have deteriorated further f r o m 11 percent and 9 percent to 16
percent and 22 percent respectively. Closer supervision and proactive management o f the portfolio w i l l be
required to address actual problem projects, monitor projects-at-risk, and bring the riskiness rating o f the
portfolio back down to below 10 percent, which i s comparable to India’s past performance.
India remains the largest IDA beneficiary and the fourth largest IBRD borrower o f the Bank
56.
Group, with an active portfolio at end-June 2004 comprising 63 projects with a net commitment o f USS12
billion ( I D A : US$6 b.; I B R D : US$6 b.; GEFIMontreal Protocol: US$O. 1 b.) and an un-disbursed balance
o f USS7.6 billion ( I D A : USS3.9 b.; IBRD: USS3.7 b.). The trend in net commitment and un-disbursed
balance amounts has been stable throughout FY98-03.
Infrastructure and Energy, w h i c h includes transport, urbanhural water and sanitation: urban

development and disaster management, i s the largest sector in the portfolio, with 20 projects amounting to

Page 1 I os16

US$5.7 b i l l i o n or 47 percent o f total net commitments, Human Development i s the second largest sector
in the portfolio (12 projects in health, population and nutrition and 7 projects in education, for a combined
25 percent o f total net commitments), followed by Rural Development (with 18 projects amounting to
US$2.6 b i l l i o n or 22 percent o f total net Commitments), Poverty Reduction and Economic Management
(2 projects; 5 percent) and Environment and Social Development (3 projects; 1 percent).
58.
About 60 percent o f the Bank’s current portfolio i s concentrated in seven states. The largest state
portfolios are in UP (17 percent o f total commitments), AP (1 1 percent), Maharashtra (9 percent), Gujarat
(8 percent) and T a m i l Nadu, Rajasthan, Karnataka (7 percent). Centrally implemented projects n o w
account for 38 percent o f total commitments and state implementing agencies account for the balance.
Five o f the seven operations approved in FY03 were investment loans for single state projects. Four o f the
seven operations approved during F Y 0 4 were single state projects (Attachment 1).
59.
At the end o f the C A S period, IFC’s heldportjolio in India consisted o f investments in 84
companies, with total exposure o f US$1.14 billion for IFC’s own account and USS167 m i l l i o n for B-loan
participants. IFC intensified i t s project supervision during the C A S period, with the establishment o f
portfolio units in New D e l h i and Mumbai, which together supervise about 40 general manufacturing and
financial markets investments. Being closer to the client and market has enabled I F C to monitor its
portfolio more effectively as well as seek new investment opportunities out o f the existing portfolio.
Increased attention has been given to resolving portfolio problems and to timing IFC’s exit from investee
companies in order to optimize capital gains.

5.

TRIGGERS, NEW LENDING AND INVESTMEETS

60.
T w o lending scenarios were set out for FY02-04: (i)
a base case o f about US$3 billion per year
( U S 2 . 1 5 b i l l i o n IBRD, USS850 m i l l i o n IDA), including about US$500-900 m i l l i o n per year o f
adjustment lending; and (ii)
a l o w case o f about US$1.5-2.0 b i l l i o n per year (US$l.O-1.5 billion IBRD,
and a core IDA program o f US$400-500 million). Movement between the low-case and base-case lending
scenarios was to be regulated by two sets o f triggers: self-activating triggers, linked to fiscal and
structural reforms at the state level; and global triggers linked to overall macroeconomic perfoiiiiance:
61.
Lending commitments ultimately f e l l short o f the base case o f the C A S and below the program
envisioned at the time o f the Progress Report. The total planned base case lending over the C A S period
was US$9 b i l l i o n ( U S 6 . 4 billion IBRD; and US$2.6 b i l l i o n IDA) and actual lending was USS5.2 billion
(US$2.2 billion IBRD; and US$2.9 billion IDA). The detailed lending program for FY02-04 i s provided
as Attachment 1.
62.
The m a i n reasons for the lending shortfall were delays in both adjustment and investment lending
due to the slower-than-expected pace o f reform implementation in some states. The selflnctivatirig
triggem did indeed cause a substantial reduction in lending volumes at the state l e v e l . For example, i n the
case o f UP, the planned second phase adjustment operation was postponed indefinitely. The second
phase o f B a n k support for power sector reform in AP was also put o n h o l d due to slow progress in that
sector. Similar concerns delayed agreement o n the first adjustment loan for Orissa, which was envisaged
for F Y 0 3 at the time o f the Progress Report. W h i l e substantial progress has n o w been made on t h i s
operation, it was held up by slow implementation o f actions in the state’s power sector. Engagements
with other states, including Maharashtra and Punjab, were confined to analytical w o r k and dialogue for
FY02-04.
In general, slow reform movement in both power and urban development w e r e responsible for a
63,
considerable portion o f the reduction in IBRD lending volumes. Given this. i t i s evident that the self-

Page I 2 ?/ 16

liidin CAS
iiiiiies

2

activating triggers were successful in modulating the level o f Bank assistance to match the pace o f state
reforms.
The global triggers o f the C A S w e r e based o n (i)
improvements in fiscal and external balances;
64.
(ii)important structural reforms, including extemal trade liberalization, banking, deregulation and
privatization o f public enterprises; and (iii)
improved perfomiance o f the Bank portfolio, including a
disbursement ratio o f at least 17 percent. India’s m i x e d performance in these areas at the t i m e of the
Progress Report suggested that overall perfonnance was consistent with the l o w end o f the base case for
lending. In the event, however, the application o f global triggers was moot during the C A S period since
the self-activating triggers had already significantly reduced state lending. With hindsight, these global
triggers may also have been overly complex for achieving their purpose.

65.
Despite the slowdown in IBRD commitments, IDAfinancing remained in strong demand particularly for support to rural poverty reduction initiatives (e.g., AP and Chhattisgarh) which are l e s s
dependent on state level reform and instead require a greater emphasis on community-driven development
and building capacity o f local governments. IDA also supported crucial water resources management
reforms (e.g., in Rajasthan and UP). In utilizing IDA resources, India benefited both from a special
allocation o f additional IDA (about 180 m i l l i o n in Special Drawing Rights) for response to the Gujarat
earthquake.

66.
During F Y 0 4 the Bank has engaged in an intensive and highly productive dialogue with GoI, to
follow up on GoI’s request to renew our partnership with the Center, and move towards a higher degree
o f collaboration and program delivery in the coming years. This dialogue, which has included iterative
discussions with the Ministry o f Finance and sectoral ministries, has already begun to show results in
FY04. M a n y o f these results have set the foundation for the FYOS-OS C A S - including a greater level o f
agreement o n sector strategies and a m u c h higher level o f ‘readiness’ in the lending pipeline than has
recently been the case. One example o f this enhanced pipeline readiness i s the completion o f n i n e project
appraisals for possible F Y 0 5 projects during FY04. There was also a sharp increase in delivery and
review o f project concept notes for future operations, with twenty-four reviews undertaken during F Y 0 4
compared to about eleven such reviews per year in F Y 0 2 and FY03.
67.
F o r IFCprograrns, commitments in India grew strongly over the C A S period, albeit with
considerable variation in response to changing market and regulatory conditions. Over the last t\vo years
IFC achieved record Commitments in India, nearly doubling i t s portfolio, improving profitability and
investing in high impact projects. India today i s IFC’s second largest exposure. In FY03, IFC committed
a record U S 3 4 8 m i l l i o n and in FY04, IFC commitments were USS290 million, with a concentration o f
manufacturing, as well as investments in agribusiness, power, o i l and gas, finance and healthcare. The
expansion was mainly in long-term debt, aided by the introduction (in FY02) o f local currency lending
which i s better suited to sectors such as infrastructure, housing finance and healthcare that do not generate
foreign exchange.
IFC has been at the forefront in supporting Indian industry’s efforts to achieve international
68.
competitiveness in the face o f declining tariffs. I t s investments focused on introducing new cost-effective
technologies in second-tier and medium-sized companies that are developing new markets and products;
restructuring to become internationally competitive; expanding to establish a regional or global presence.
I F C supported pioneering application o f technology by backing IT companies with a potential for
contribution to economic development and supporting the movement o f India‘s IT sector into higliervalue added market segments. In the financial sector, IFC supported the growth o f institutions providing
financing to underserved sections including SMEs, micro-enterprises, and the rural sector through i t s
investments in microfinance, factoring, vehicle financing, and export financing targeted at SMEs. I F C
also provided long t e r m financing to housing finance companies, extending the availability o f mortgage

credit to lower income groups and to rural areas and giving an important boost to the construction
industry and associated SMEs. IFC introduced new debt products and helped the development o f the
long-term debt market by providing partial credit guarantees to debt issues o f a mobile network operator
and a paper manufacturer.

69.
In infrastructure, despite IFC’s active pursuit o f infrastructure investments during the C A S
period, few o f these reached commitment stage due to obstacles in the regulatory and policy environment.
However, there was n e w opportunity for investment in the power sector - as IFC, along w i t h Powergrid
and Tata Power, financed the f i r s t public-private partnership transmission project in Asia. This 1:200
kilometer transmission line between the Indo-Bhutan border and Mandaula near Delhi will evacuate
power generated by the Go1 financed 1,000 megawatt power plant in Bhutan. IFC will seek to replicate
this model in other transmission and generation projects.

70.
IFC committed US$5 m i l l i o n alongside a number o f donors to establish a regional SME Facility
with a total five-year budget o f more than US35 million. The facility, which i s based in Dhalta,is
promoting S M E development by providing technical assistance to SMEs and banks and professional
service finns that serve them in Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and N o r t h East India.
7 1.
In regard to MIGA in India, as noted in the Progress Report, MIGA has no outstanding guarantees
for projects in India, but has insured projects undertaken by Indian companies in other countries.
Recently, MIGA has been approached to support renewable energy projects, including biomass and 1%iiid
farms in India.

6.

ANALYTICAL AND ADVISORY ACTIVITIES (AAA)

72.

On AAA, the C A S envisaged that the Bank would use a program o f knowledge support:
T o meet the Bank’s due diligence requirements at both the national and the state level;
In conjunction with lending, to bolster the effectiveness o f Bank support - for example, at the
state-level, regular public expenditure reviews and analyses o f growth, poverty, service delivery,
financial accountability; and
T o promote capacity building and knowledge sharing, in cases where i t i s important to open the
dialogue o n development and poverty reduction challenges, e.g., in poor non-refoniiing states, or
where policy reforms are required without a corresponding need for financial assistance.

73.
Unlike Bank lending, which was reduced by the slowdown in some state reforms, the AAA
program o f the Bank was expanded. The number o f discrete activities which were delivered - whether
policy notes, workshops, non-lending TA, etc. was greater than had been anticipated in the C A S as the
Bank attempted to respond to issues and requests raised by an increasing number o f states and partners.
Meeting due diligence requiremeizts
74.
As noted in Section 3, ‘the Bank undertook considerable w o r k to improve i t s knowledge o f
procurement and financial management issues at both the state and central levels in India - and to assist
governments in strengthening their fiduciary capacity. This w o r k program i s ongoing, and i s likely to
continue to be scaled up, particularly given i t s relevance to sector-wide approaches aiid ne\\! ways in
which the Bank i s working to support India.

Pnge 14 of I 6

In addition, fiscal reviews were completed for all the states where the Bank i s active in a dialogue
75.
on cross-cutting reforms or on SAL preparation. While a nation-wide poverty assessment was planned
for the period, this was ultimately dropped as a free standing task; an overview o f poverty issues was
integrated into the 2003 DPR, and will be updated as part o f the 2006 DPR. Other, more detailed aspects
o f poverty (for example, disability) are being addressed through separate, free-standing analytic work.

I n conjunction with lending, to bolster the effectiveness of Bank support

76.
Analytic w o r k was also used in conjunction with lending, or as a precursor to new lending, to
help answer k e y sectoral questions and shape operations. One example i s a comprehensive study o f the
health sector completed in June 2001, “Better Health Systems for India s Poor”, as w e l l as several other
policy notes, which together have served to redefine Bank health sector lending, particularly at the state
level, by detailing the need for public health systems to shift towards a stronger focus on results; develop
greater partnerships with the private sector (where most o f the poor are receiving their care); and pilot
new approaches for equitable health financing (e.g., community health insurance). Another, in the energy
sector, was completion o f a study o n Rural Energy Access - w h i c h has provided a good basis for dialogue
with Go1 and paved the way for lending re-engagement in this sector.

77.
Surveys and analysis on improving India’s investment climate, jointly carried out by the Bank
and the Confederation o f Indian Industry, have informed adjustment operations prepared for several
states. Substantial policy advice and non-lending technical assistance across k e y sectors \yere also
provided in states where adjustment lending was under preparation.
To promote capacity building and knowledge sliaring, in cases wlzere it is irtiportarrt to operr the
dialogue on developrnerit and poverty rediiction clialleriges
Several major studies such as the DPR, Agricultural Policy Review and an AP Growth Study
78.
were completed with the aim o f disseminating key messages more widely across India. The Bank also
provided advice to Go1 o n h o w best to tackle trade policy challenges in the services sector.

79.
Other examples include analytical work o n indoor air pollution. T w o reports - Household
Energy, Indoor Air Pollution and Health (2002) and Access o f the Poor to Clean Households Fuels - were
completed, and the dialogue i s underway to assist with developing programs to create a coiiiiiiercial
market for clean household energy products and services in rural areas. T o evaluate and further enhance
the health benefits o f RWSS investments, a major study to measure the environmental health outcomes o f
Bank-supported R W S S projects was initiated in FY04.
80.
Numerous other sectoral policy notes, workshops and dissemination activities were also delivered
to bolster the reform process at both the federal and state levels (Attachment 2).

CONCLUSION
81.
The CAS noted that the m a i n risk to Bank support in India mas a vefom deraiZnze///,which would
also translate to slower growth and progress in reducing poverty. While the reforms have b e e n broadly on
track, their pace has been uneven. The document also closed by highlighting a common risk that the
Bank Group faces in all large countries like India - namely the r i s k o f becoming l e s s relevant. This did
not happen and the B a n k Group has continued to play a strong supporting role in India’s reform process,
particularly at the state level.

The Country Team’s assessment i s that the main thrusts o f the C A S were both relevant to the
82.
development challenges in India, and effective in pointing out ways to leverage the impact o f the Bank’s
limited resources. The program was ambitious in i t s efforts to catalyze and expand the state reform
process in areas that are central to reducing poverty in India. Though progress in reform was slower than
expected, the C A S was also well structured to deal with the slow down in reform implementation that
took place in several states. In this respect, the ‘self-regulating’ triggers o f the C A S worked w e l l in
modulating Bank assistance to the pace o f reform.

By focusing on key aspects o f the reform agenda and working in partnership with GoI, reforming
83.
states and others, the Bank Group was able to have considerable positive impact. In doing so, the Bank
Group relied o n several strengths, including i t s ability to gather and share global knowledge and
experiences with Go1 and other important audiences in India (e.g., the 2003 DPR and Agricultural Policy
Review). The Bank Group employed a broad array of tools to help inobilize private financing and foster
greater private sector participation in India’s development (e.g., the greatly increased investments o f IFC).
Through i t s lending and investments, the Bank Group also helped to catalyze greater effectiveness and
inore efficient spending o f others (Le., via adjustment lending and refonn based investment lending to
state level governments), towards the ultimate goal o f reducing poverty and encouraging India’s
sustainable development.
Though the FY02-04 strategy was broadly appropriate, there are both important lessons o f
84.
experience and shifts in the development context that suggest an evolution (rather than a fundamental
rethink) o f the strategy going forward. Experience reconfirms the value o f engaging with states
undertaking comprehensive reforms via adjustment lending - but also underlines the importance o f clear
conditionality linked to reducing the state’s fiscal deficit; the value o f a medium-term engagement with
states, through ups and downs in reform implementation performance; and t h e appropriateness o f ‘backloading’ adjustment support. I t has also suggested that i t would be appropriate to pay greater attention to
debt restructuring as an instrument for enhancing progressive restructuring o f expenditure towards
priority areas.
85.
Given the volatility o f the state level reform process, experience also suggests that investment
lending should not necessarily be clustered in states undergoing adjustment programs. The Country
Team’s review o f the CAS also makes clear the importance o f a more strategic approach to the Bank’s
analytic work, with a renewed focus o n high quality products and strong disseiiiinatioii plans, in order to
raise the debate o n critical issues o f national concern in India’s development process.
Finally, one o f the most important trends underlined in the 2003 DPR i s that, as better-performing
86.
states have made greater progress, the largest and poorest states are being increasingly ‘left behind’ with
poverty and weak social indicators. The MDGs will not be achieved without greater economic
opportunities and better human development outcomes in these lagging states - suggesting the
importance o f further thinking about h o w the B a n k could best reconcile the conflict between needs and
performance-based approaches to our w o r k in India.

Summary o f the Consultation Process

1. The Process
Consultations with various tiers o f government, c i v i l society, donors and the private sector have been an
integral part o f the C A S formulation process. Given the multiplicity and geographical spread o f
stakeholders in the Bank Group’s w o r k in India, and their wide range o f priorities and points o f view, the
challenge was to conduct truly representative and focused consultations that could provide meaningful
input and direction to C A S formulation.

The consultation strategy. has, therefore, been based o n the following principles: a) feedback would be
elicited in a focused manner on the emerging themes and issues that were expected to underpin the CAS;
b) participants would reflect a divergence o f views, but would be familiar with the w o r k and role o f the
Bank; and c) consultations would be low-key and transparent so that expectations f r o m the exercise w e r e
realistic.
The consultation process has comprised four elements:
0

I n d i a client survey: About 1,000 interlocutors in government, c i v i l society, academia, media and
the private sector were invited to participate in a two-part survey for their views on key
development issues in India, and on the Bank Group’s effectiveness and priorities. O f these; 5 8 1
responded to the first part, which was a quantitative opinion survey. Eighty o f these respondents
were then invited to participate in the second (qualitative) part that consisted o f group discussions
o n themes that emerged f r o m the first part. The survey instrument was tailored out o f the standard
B a n k Group survey, and was conducted by an independent, private sector marltet research firiii,
Taylor Nelson Sofres Mode, over October-December 2003. A summary o f the findings i s
provided below.
Targeted iiieetirzgs: Before the drafting o f the C A S began, a series o f meetings was held over
several months with sector ministries, based o n notes prepared by the Bank to discuss key
sectoral challenges and h o w best the Bank could help. These discussions provided an important
input to the subsequent drafting o f Section I V o f the CAS (World Bank Group Program
Priorities). Throughout the drafting process, extensive feedback was provided by govei-ninent
counterparts in the Ministry o f Finance, as w e l l as sector ministries. Several noted Indian
economists and policymakers beyond government were also requested to provide in formal review
and advice. The consultation draft was also circulated to sector ministries for final comments.
Oizlirze consultations: In June 2004, after discussion with the government, the main text o f the
C A S was posted on the extemal websites o f the India Country Office in English. Hindi, Kaniiada
and Telugu for public review and comment for a period o f four weeks. Awareness o f t h i s facility
was created through a press conference in N e w Delhi addressed by the Regional Vice President
and Country Director, email and fax notification to Bank contacts, the Country Office quarterly
newsletter, and other means o f outreach.

0

Coizsultatiorz workshops: In July, the B a n k Group hosted a series o f half-day worl<shops in
Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Lucknow, with invited representatives o f the central, state and
local governments, donors, the private sector, academia, media and NGOs These meetings \+ere
aimed at obtaining direct feedback on the C A S draft The Country Director presented the strategy
to the participants, and t h e n responded to all comments A summary i s provided belon.

2. Summary of feedback
A. India Client Survey, first phase (quantitative): O f the 5 8 1 respondents to the survey. the largest
number came f r o m the media, followed by state govemment, c i v i l society, academia, and central
government. They represented almost all the states, with the highest numbers f r o m N e w Delhi, f o l l o u ed
by Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kamataka and Uttar Pradesh.
Poverty reduction emerged as the number one development challenge, followed by improving
infrastructure, corruption, government effectiveness, and access to education. Respondents cited
population growth, inadequate infrastructure, lack o f access to quality education, and scarcity o f water
resources as the m a i n challenges to sustainable growth.
Respondents saw the Bank Group’s greatest value in helping to strengthen infrastructure development?
giving this contribution an overall rating o f 4.4 o n a 5-point scale. This was followed by: helping to
improve the energy sector, improving access o f the poor to health services, improving water resource
development and management, and providing support to low-perfomiing states. The Bank’s greatest
weaknesses were considered to be: imposing technocratic solutions without regard to political realities:
and not exploring alternate policy options.

The Bank Group was given an overall rating o f 5.8 o n a scale o f 10 for the effectiveness o f i t s work, w i t h
local government and project implementing agency officials giving high ratings, and the media and civil
society rating it l o w . Other key impressions were (ratings above 5 on a IO-point scale):
The Bank Group i s an effective catalyst for discussion on issues related to poverty
The Bank Group’s procurement rules and fiduciary controls help make projects more effective
The Bank Group’s w o r k i s aligned w i t h the country’s development priorities
The Bank Group places reasonable conditions o n i t s lending
The Bank Group’s w o r k promotes the empowerment o f poor people to participate in development
There was a relatively l o w rating for whether the Bank Group plays a u s e f d role in helping India
reduce corruption and nepotism.
Over 85 percent o f respondents indicated that India i s moving in the right direction, particularly in terms
o f sustaining economic recovery and promoting growth, ensuring adequate infrastructure, ensuring
education for children, and reducing gender disparities. There was less agreement o n whether the country
i s moving in the right direction in improving govemance, delivering services to the poor, and reducing
corruption.
The survey showed some clear attitudinal distinctions in the three ‘focus states’ o f the preceding CAS
period: AP, Kamatalta and UP. In general, respondents were most negative in A P about the Bank, i t s
work, i t s style, and about the level o f support they wanted f r o m foreign agenciesiorganizations. In
contrast, U P and Kamatalta returned consistently positive ratings.

On the strategy to b e f o l l o w e d towards states, more than h a l f (5 1%) f e l t the B a n k Group should focus

i t s resources o n “low performance” states n7hile nearly 40% preferred states where the government i s

undertaking difficult fiscal, governance and energy reforms.

Respondents overall rated the Bank Group’s knowledge as 4 o n a scale o f 5 for both i t s usefulness and
technical competence. However, the rating slipped to 3.3 for the ability to adapt i t s knowledge to India‘s
needs.

Secondphase (qualitative): In this phase, 80 individuals f r o m among the 581 respondents o f the first
phase were invited to participate in group discussions on the emerging themes. They represented all
respondent categories (central and state government, private sector, academia, media and NGOs) and
were convened in groups o f 10 in eight cities. Experienced moderators from the market research firm
conducted the discussions and the Bank was not present.
Ci.iteria for lending to states: The groups were asked what criteria agencies such as the Bank Group
should adopt for lending strategies towards states -reform or need. Karnataka, AP, Tamil N a d u and
Maharashtra were perceived as reforming states, and were said to be more responsive and pragmatic in
solving economic and social problems. The v i e w was also that they were more disciplined and spent
prudently. On the other hand, ‘non-performing’ states were characterized as having poor infrastructure,
poor governance, and an inability to make full use o f their natural resources or allotted f h d s .

A clear majority said the first category o f states was more likely to make good u s e o f funds f r o m agencies
such as the Bank Group and should be targeted for more lending as an incentive to remain proactive and
continue to show results. But a significant minority f e l t there were historical reasons for the condition o f
the non-performers and they should not be penalized by being denied funds. This group argued that to
ignore the non-performers would lead to lopsided development, which would spawn its o w n set o f
problems.
A third stream o f opinion was that a state’s performance or need should not be the criterion, but rather
there should be a focus o n the likely impact o f the particular project or program. These participants listed
specific parameters for lending decisions, including earmarking for basic infrastructure l i k e roads and
power: health facilities, education, water and sanitation, and creating livelihood opportunities.
In sum, most favored allocations based on a state’s ‘performance’ but others stressed ‘need’ as the
criterion, and a third set preferred allocations based o n specific project and program parameters.

Sectors to be targeted; Poverty emerged as India’s biggest development challenge, w i t h respondents
listing the following obstacles as the biggest impediments to poverty alleviation: Unemployment, lack o f
basic infrastructure, illiteracy and population growth.

A strong view was that unemployment can be tackled by building infrastructure s u c h as irrigation
facilities, roads, power and telecoiiiiiiuiiications. Respondents f e l t the Bank Group should give highest
priority to addressing unemployment and building infrastructure. They suggested that by helping India
create world-class infrastructure, the Bank and IFC could help improve the investment climate and make
the country an attractive investment destination. These agencies could also help design administrative and
legal reforms required to attract investments, besides helping t o promote India at international summits.
Knowledge and international experience: The participants overwhelmingly f e l t the Bank Group’s
knowledge and technical expertise were o f help t o the country. Such assistance could be used to improve
the running o f projects, and create transparent and accountable administrative systems. The B a n k Group
should disseminate i t s reports and studies more effectively, and also foster learning and sharing o f
experiences across countries. I t was felt that the Bank Group should also support improvements in the
management o f the public sector while providing expertise to the private sector.

The results o f the Client Survey and discussions with the government were the two main external inputs
to the formulation o f the first draft o f the Country Strategy. They informed the thinking on issues such as
the strategy to be adopted towards states, and o n the content o f engagement in infrastructure, water,
human and rural development.
Specific inputs used include: Renewing the Bank’s program o f support to infrastructure in India; and,
greater attention to the Bank‘s program o f knowledge services, including reshaping the program to be
more demand-driven, putting n e w mechanisms in place to improve the quality and relevance for India,
and greater attention to dissemination.

B. Online coizsultntions: The Bank received a small number o f responses over the web. Two o f these
were froin well-known anti-dam organizations (one Indian, the other international) and the rest were from
individuals. Some o f the points made were:

The document should be more explicit about lessons learned f r o m the Bank’s experience in AP.
I t i s incorrect t o credit the post-1991 reforms for increasing incoiiies and improved living standards as
no reform-wise impact study has been done o n people’s access to employment, livelihood, water,
power and other basic necessities.
The Bank should not support investments in hydropower; critiques were also made o f proposals for
reform in agriculture and the power sector.
The attempt to harmonize fiduciary and safeguard policies i s likely to severely weaken existing
measures to avoid and mitigate negative social and environmental impacts o f B a n k Group projects, as
the safeguard policies o f the Go1 are weaker than those o f the Bank Group.
The consultation process was “a mock”.
Small farmers will not be able to survive a reduction in agriculture subsidies.

C. Consultation workshops: On the whole, there was endorsement o f the general thrust o f the CAS.
especially o f i t s strategic principles and program priorities. In particular, there was strong support for the
knowledge role and the new strategy towards states. M a n y participants welcomed the initlati\ e,
transparency, and inclusiveness o f the consultation process. Some participants in one worltsliop,
however, f e l t the consultations were rushed and there was inadequate time to review the strategy and offer
significant inputs.
Feedback and recurring themes that emerged f r o m these consultations, w h i c h have been addressed in the
final CAS are:
N o t enough emphasis o n urban development, especially o n increasing the quality o f l i f e in urban
slums, improving economic opportunities for the urban poor, and reducing urban povei-ty through
measures such as access to property rights.
Mention should be made o f populatioii growth and high fertility rates.
There should be more explicit recognition o f the issue o f economic and social exclusion o f
historically discriminated groups and women, which remains a major obstacle to India’s
development.
M o r e emphasis o n the need to harness and develop water resources, especially as i t relates to
irrigation, as this can positively impact rural livelihoods.
There should be a more comprehensive approach to rural energy, including renewable sources, and
the strategy should not be confined to rural electrification.
The Bank should recognize the issue o f land ownership and land reform, w h i c h i s a k e y bottleneck to
India‘s development.

Instruments and Guiclelines for Lending
I n addition to the specific sectoral guidelines listed below, there would be
four basic requirements for investment lending in any state o r sector:
J
Adequate sector governance backed by commitment at tlie state or central
level;
J Lending t o states w i t h i n the framework o f a Medium Term Fiscal Reform
Program agreed between the state and GoI;
J
An approach that i s at least supportive o f fiscal and administrative
decentralization; and
J
Satisfactory implementation o f steps to improve portfolio performance in
the state o r sector.

At the state level, in the energy sector, the Bank could provide AAA, TA and
a range of lending and credit enhancement instruments contingent on the
level of commitment and track record for reform in a state:

and mechanisms for implementation.
In states that have deinoizstrnted coi7zim'ti7~eiztto reforin by upfront action
and p o l i c y changes o n structural and governance reforms and clear initial
improvements in cost recovery and financial performance, the Bank would
consider TA and investment loans confined t o financing items needed to
advance r e f o r m implementation. (Such states might also benefit from
structural adjustment lending in the context o f overall progress with
structural reforms - o f w h i c h power reforms w o u l d be one part ).
In states that are f o l l o w i n g through with well-designed privatization
transactions and the facilitation o f new entry, the Bank could provide
support through Sector Adjustment Lending, and partial risk guarantees.
In states that are willing t o open rural access and apply tariffs that at least
cover the recurrent costs o f rtiml electrzjkntioii, investment
loanslguarantees to support rtirnl electrijkntioiz could be considered.

India: Private Sector Strategy for the W o r l d Bank Group

Indian policy makers recognize that a vibrant private sector - with finns in\.esting, creating jobs:
1.
and improving productivity - i s central to promoting growth and expanding opportunities for poor people.
The Government o f India's (GoI) Tenth Five Year Plan sets ambitious targets for G D P growth (around
8% per year over the next decade) and employment creation (100 m i l l i o n new jobs) required to
substantially reduce the incidence o f poverty. The Plan notes that achieving these targets will require a
sharp step up in investment, particularly private investment (domestic and foreign), coupled with
improved productivity.

2.
Private investment in India averaged around 15% o f G D P In the 1990s (somewhat below the
average for l o w income countries and below the level necessary to accelerate growth to a sustainable 8%
a year). I t was largely financed from domestic savings - foreign direct investment (FDI) i i i f l o n s to India
have averaged only around U S $ 5 billion annually over the past few years. as compared to USS40 billion
annually to China. As a share o f GDP, FDI in India stood at under 1% percent in 2002/03, compared with
4% in China and between 2% and 3% in many emerging market countries.

Note: Table froni the India Development Policy Review. World Bank. June 2003

In 2001, the manufacturing sector in India accounted for around 17% o f GDP, compared with
3.
35% in China and 25-35% in South East Asian economies.' India's share o f non-agricultural exports in
w o r l d exports increased marginally f r o m 0.5% in 1990/91 to 0.55% in 2000/01. India's services exports
have fared better, today accounting for 1.4% o f global exports in services. But this growth took place on

the back o f a narrow set o f subsectors, primarily software exports, which grew at an annual average rate
o f 49% during the second h a l f o f the 1990s. India's performance in travel and transportation services:
where the underlying growth i s linked to trade in goods, has been mediocre.

International comparisons indicate that India has intrinsic advantages, such as niacroeconoinic
stability, a large and rapidly growing local market, a large and relatively low-cost labor force, a critical
I

The organized industry and service sectors i n India today together account for just about 27 million jobs, or under 7% o f total
employment; some 70% o f organized jobs are i n the public sector. Organized manufacturing pi-ovidesjust 7 iniillioii jobs: 01under 2% o f total employment.

mass o f well-educated workers, and abundant r a w materials, that should allow i t to attract and sustain
higher levels o f private investment, both domestically and foreign financed. Capitalizing on these
national advantages, India’s private sector has registered some important achievements in the past decade
and a h a l f - for example, the development o f exports o f software and back office services, the emergence
o f a competitive automotive sector and quantum improvements in domestic air travel - driven largely by
the liberalizing reforms initiated in the early 1990s.

At the same time, the potential s t i l l to be tapped i s clearly enormous. The Bank’s investment
climate assessments (ICAs) for India, and other recent studies,’ show that the private sector in India
continues to be constrained by a number o f factors, especially: (i)product market distortions, includiiig
persistent wealmesses in the tax and tariff regimes, restrictions o n foreign direct investment (FDI),
regulatory restrictions o n the industrial sector (particularly for sinal1 businesses),distortioils in the pricing
and marketing o f agricultural products, and business inefficiencies arising from bureaucratic hassles; (ii)
factor market distortions that impede the functioning o f labor and land markets, and wealmesses in the
competitive environment, including in legal framework for business operation and exit; (iii)problems in

coinpetitiveness have been estimated to be in the range o f 2% to 4% per aiiiiuin. A study by McKiiisey
(200 1) estimated that addressing the inefficiencies generated by the multiplicity o f investment
regulations, distortions in the land markets, and widespread government ownership o f business, would
free India’s economy to grow as fast as China’s, at 10% a year, and create some 75 m i l l i o n n e w jobs,
sufficient n o t only to provide employment to n e w entrants in the work force, but also to reabsorb the
majority o f workers displaced by productivity improvements. The I C A 2002 estimated that, if each
Indian state could attain the best practice in India in terms o f investment climate, GDP growth could
increase by about 2 percentage points. The survey indicated that, if India could achieve Chinese or Thai
levels in distinct investinent climate areas where it lags behind those countries, i t s growth acceleration
would be even more dramatic. While recognizing India’s real achievements in promoting the private
sector in the last decade and a half, the balance of this section focuses on an assessment o f the key
constraints that s t i l l remain.

March 2003, including the protective effect o f the Special Additional Duty (SAD). the un-weighted
average protective tariff was about 32.796, overall, 30.7% for industrial goods and 46 8% for agricultural
products including processed foods. This i s far lower than pre-reform tariff levels during the 1980s. but
still very high by w o r l d standards (for example, China’s import duties are expected to average 9% b y
2005). High import tariffs drive up the prices o f finished products, suppress demand and provide
opportunities for inefficient f i r m s to survive and for efficient f i r m s to capture rents. A phased reduction in
tariffs i s thus a critical priority.

significantly liberalized, FDI i s s t i l l subject to limits, particularly on full ownership by foreign players

apparel, another important sector for j o b creation, FDI i s limited to 24% o f equity. In housing
construction, restrictions o n foreign ownership o f land limit the entry o f foreign builders and developers
In banking, restrictions on foreign ownership o f domestic banks have held back improveiiieiits in

The growth o f small business has’ been inhibited by investment ceilings and product r e s e n ations for
small-scale industries (SSIs). A t the start o f the reform program o f the early 1990s, soine 800 i t e m s \\ere
reserved for exclusive production in the S S I sector, which meant that investment in plaiit and machinery
in any individual SSI unit in a ‘reserved product category’ could not exceed the narrowly defined
investment ceiling. The l i s t o f reserved items has been pruned, but soine 590 items continue to remain
reserved. Small f i r m s that produce goods in the reserved sectors cannot expand, achieve economies of
scale, and improve efficiency. Also, the efficiency o f private investment in agriculture i s constrained by
minimum support prices o n agricultural products, input subsidies, as w e l l as some laws and procedures
that create barriers to trade and movement o f agricultural commodities and prevent corporate investment
in agriculture.

While the complex web o f regulations luiowii as the

“License Raj” has been substantially reduced at the Center, i t survives at the state level, along w i t h a
pervasive culture o f government interference known as the “Inspector Raj”, imposing serious costs on
doing business in India, and reducing competitiveness. Private investors require many approvals from
state government to start a business. They also have to interact with state bureaucracy in day-to-day
operations because o f laws goveming pollution, sanitation, worker welfare, etc. The W o r l d Bank’s Doing
Business indicators show that the median time to start a business in India 89 days, almost t h e e times
higher than in China. The ICA 2004 shows that Indian manufacturers face, o n average, 8.9 visits per year
froin govemment officials. Although this has reduced f r o m 10.8 visits in 2000, and there are significant
variations across states, even the best Indian state compares poorly w i t h a country l i k e Malaysia. where
the average number o f visits i s 2.8. Moreover, 15.8% o f senior iiiaiiageinent t i m e each year i s spent

and 11.2% for China. Such high levels o f government interaction raise the potential for corruption, v, hich
survey respondents regard as a major problem. Reducing costs related to delays and rent seeking \ \ o d d

f i r m s are one o f the greatest challenges o f doing business in India. India’s complex labor market
legislation i s designed to protect the formal sector workforce, but has the effect o f deterring the creation
o f formal jobs, which as a result account for just about 7% o f the country’s total workforce. Employment
in India’s registered f i r m s (those with iiiore than 100 employees) i s highly protected. Any registered firm
wishing t o retrench labor can only do so with the permission o f the state government which i s rarely
granted. These provisions make labor rationalization in registered f i r m s very difficult, discourage the
hiring o f labor in the organized sector, and are especially onerous for labor-intensive sectors. They are
obviously especially burdensome for exporters who have to compete with producers in other exporting
countries. And they also explain the tendency o f FDI to focus o n the domestic inarltet rather than use
India as a base for exports. The ICA 2002 found that the typical Indian firm reported having 17% more
workers than i t desired and that the labor laws and regulations were the main reason why i t could not
adjust to the preferred level. Further, the use o f contract labor i s restricted to temporary activities by the
existing Contract Labor Act.

According to ICA 2002, some 90% o f land parcels in India are reportedly subject to disputes over
ownership, which take decades to settle in court. Restrictive tenancy and rent control laws keep a large
part o f urban real estate o f f the market. The central government has already abolished the Urban Land
Ceiling Act, which previously made changes in land use very difficult. But only a f e w states have
repealed their corresponding Land Ceiling Acts, and this i s an urgent priority for state governments.
I ~ A [i , Difficulty in recovering distressed assets and the lack
o f effective bankruptcy procedures have made industrial restructuring and business exit very difficult
This has burdened the financial sector with high non-performing loans (NPLs) and deterred lending to the
industrial sector. The recently enacted l a w on Securitization and Reconstruction o f Financial Assets and

important step that could push debtors to pay up. However, the effectiveness o f the l a w r e i n a i m a matter

enactment o f Amendments to the Companies A c t (January 2003) and repeal o f the Sick Industries

process, thereby helping to speed up bankruptcy proceedings. The n e w banlu-uptcy fraiiiework also

After more than a decade o f financial reforms and deregulation, initiated in 1991, India’s

sector has not been able to efficiently allocate resources to the private sector, to finance the higher l e v e l s
o f investment necessary for sustained growth, j o b creation and poverty reduction. The ratio o f pri\,ate
credit (from deposit money banks and other financial institutions) to G D P in India remains l o w at under
40%, compared to over 100% for countries such as China, Korea and Malaysia. W h i l e the top layer o f
Indian corporates (which can n o w access both intemational and domestic capital markets) today have
much better access to finance than in the past, critical sectors, such as small and medium enterprises
(SMEs), m r a l households and micro enterprises face serious difficulties in accessing adequate finance on
competitive terms.

A number o f policies have distorted banks’ risk-return signals. Banks’ borrowing costs are kept
16.
high by floors on short-temi deposit rates, while Govemment policy dictates that lending rates on sinal1
loans (up to Rs. 200,000) be capped at the prime lending rate (which banks are free to set). These
restrictions make banks reluctant to lend to small clients, particularly rural households and inicroenterprises, who are perceived as high risk. Statutory pre-emption o f credit through high liquidity and
cash reserve ratios and directed (“priority sector”) credit crowd out lending to the private sector.
Government’s large deficit, financed through the market, further crowds out credit to the private sector.

17.
Financial regulations and laws have been upgraded but poor enforcement weakens m a r k e t
discipline and integrity. Gaps also remain in the infrastructure undei-pinningfinancial institutions and
markets, for instance, the lack o f credit information services, and the absence o f a well-developed
integrated clearing and settlement system for capital markets, Goveminent maintains restrictions on
foreign borrowing by Indian companies (including loans f r o m IFC), which constrains the competitiveness
o f Indian companies by inhibiting them f r o m accessing capital from foreign sources. Interest caps are
also imposed, inhibiting foreign borrowing for riskier projects, including infrastructure projects.
18.
An efficient and sound financial system that can mobilize resources (including longer term
resources) and allocate them towards productive investment i s critical to ensuring better access to finance
for sectors (such as SMEs, rural households and micro enterprises, and n e w infrastructure projects) that
are currently underserved, and to ensuring overall growth, and stability. As elaborated in the Bank’s
Financial Sector Strategy (May 2002), key reform priorities for the Go1 include: reducing goveiiiment
ownership/domination o f the financial sector and correcting the policies that distort credit allocation
decisions; improving financial regulation and supervision (including for market risks) and better
enforcement o f laws and contracts; enhancing the quality and f l o w o f credit information; dareloping and
deepening capital markets, particularly debt markets, which are critical to the mobilization o f longer-term
resources and their efficient allocation for infrastructure investments; continuing pension system reforms,
which can play an important role not only in resource mobilization and providing longer term income
security, but also, in expanding the institutional base to support the development o f long-term savings
instruments and deepen the capital markets; encouraging the development and u s e o f inno\’ative financial
products and instruments (such as insurance products, securitization, etc.) to improve access to finance for
underserved segments and to better manage risks related to natural disasters.

19.
In the telecom and ports sectors, the regulatory framework evolved over time and once stabilized
yielded positive results in tenns o f an increase in private investment, both domestic and international In
other sectors such as power, transport, water and sanitation and solid waste, progress has been negligible

Severe infrastructure bottlenecks in these sectors hamper the efficiency and competitiveness o f Indian
business, particularly manufacturing f i r m s .

’i
The absence o f adequate, reliable power supply remains a key concern for Indian
20.
businesses. N o t only does industry receive irregular and l o w quality power (the I C A 2004 found that, on

average, manufacturers in India face 17 significant power outages per month, versus 1 i n Malaysia and
less than 5 in China and that approxiiiiately 9% o f the total value o f output o f fii-nis i s lost due to power
breakdowns - compared to 2.6% in Malaysia and 2% in China), but also: industry i s chai-ged tariffs
much above the cost o f supply. As a result, a large majority o f Indian f i r m s operate their o w n (captive)
generators. Almost 61% o f Indian manufacturing f i r m s o w n generator sets, versus 20% i n Malaysia and
27% in China. This switch to captive generators has further increased the cost o f power faced by industry
(India’s blended real cost o f power i s 74% higher than Malaysia’s and 39% higher than China’s): and
reduced industrial competitiveness. Power sector reforms are n o w widely accepted as fundamental to
improving industrial performance. An urgent priority i s the need to rationalize power tariffs, depoliticize
.the tariff-setting process, and implement a phased reduction in cross subsidies that operate against
industrial consumers. Time o f day tariffs need to be introduced for industries w i t h peak and off-peak
rates.
j?otd:;. India has one o f the most extensive transport systems in the world, but there are severe
2 1.
capacity and quality constraints, that impose costs o n firms. India currently has n o inter-state expressways
linking the major economic centers, and only 3,000 k m s o f four-lane highways (China has built 25,000
k m s o f four-to-six lane, access-controlled expressways in the last 10 years). Poor riding quality and
congestion result in truck and bus speeds o n Indian highways that average 30-40 l m s an hour, about h a l f
the expected average. Notable progress has been made with the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) project,
which links Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata and i s expected to be completed by mid-2005. The
N o r t h South-East West (NS-EW) highway project i s slated for completion by December 2008. However,
even if the GQ and the N S - E W projects are implemented o n schedule by the end o f 2008, India will have
reasonably w e l l surfaced, four-lane national highways accounting for just 22% o f the country’s national
highways and none o f the State highways, which are in serious d i ~ r e p a i r . ~

With
~ a network o f 63,OOOkms, the Indian Railways i s the second largest rail network
in the world. However, it fails to provide an efficient means for transporting goods. A key problem i s
high cargo tariffs arising out o f cross-subsidization o f passenger fares. This has caused long haul goods
traffic to move steadily away f r o m r a i l to roads. Second, excessive congestion on main lines i s steadily
increasing long haul delivery times and making the railways even more unattractive as an e rficient
transport provider. Third, the rapidly deteriorating quality o f rolling stock has led to declining safety
standards.
Although there has been limited r e f o m i and operational iniproveiiient o f soiiie o f
s and customs procedures, and increased private investment in port facilities, there
i s s t i l l considerable scope for further advance. For instance, according to the ICA 2004, the mean delay at
customs while importing i s s t i l l 6.3 days; and while exporting i t i s 5.1 days. This compares unfavorably
with, say, Malaysia where the mean delay while importing i s 3.6 days, and while exporting i t i s 2.5 days.
The upshot o f this i s that exporting industries such as garments, leather goods, textiles, pharniaceuticals
and automobile components - all o f which import r a w inaterials and intermediates - suffei from a total
delay ranging f r o m 13.4 days to 11.8. This raises the working capital requirement and reduces
competitiveness.

private sector development strategy will be on:

e

Facilitating greater private sector competitiveness through: (a) improvements in the
investment climate; (b) improved financial intermediation to the private sector: and (c) direct
support to f i m i s to promote their growth and competitiveness;
Improving the quantity and quality o f infrastructure through greater private sector
participation;
Promoting private sector participation in the provision o f health and education services;
Promoting improved rural productivity and growth through greater private investment.

25.

In selecting these priorities, the strategy takes into account the critical constraints that must be
addressed to foster private sector development and the need to balance opportunities for intervention with
the limited resources and instruments available. The choice o f priorities also reflects the W B G ’ s
comparative advantages vis-a-vis other donors and financial institutions, based on such considerations as
the WBG’s potential leverage and ability to bring to the table cross-country experience, and takes into
account the presence o f reform champions within and outside government.

26.

The strategy calls for close collaboration between the Bank and IFC, which i s expected to have a
strong pay off, allowing the institutions to gain f r o m potential synergies in k e y sectors w h i l e drawing on
their respective comparative advantages. The basic principle guiding the division o f labor i s for the Bank
to support activities which warrant public support while IFC assistance will focus o n activities that fall
within the private sector’s role.

The strategy will require engagement with GoI, state and local goveimnients, tlie private sector
27.
and independent research institutions. Given the respective mandates o f the Bank Group institutions, the
Bank’s engagement will be primarily with the Central or state governments, to support an enabling
policy, regulatory and institutional environment for private sector development. The B a n k will pursue the
strategic priorities at the Go1 level through sector-specific investment operations, where opportunities
exist (and preferably as part o f the GoI’s larger, sector-wide reform programs); at state and local
government levels, in order to maximize impact with limited resources, support to foster private sector
development will be targeted towards states/local authorities with which the Bank Group i s actively
engaged. Such support will be structured, as far as possible, either as part o f adjustment operations or
sector-specific state-level investment operations. I F C will provide direct assistance to tlie private sector,
focusing on supporting competitive industry and services and private investment in infrastructure. The
Bank and I F C w i l l work together closely to support higher private sector investment, including through
public-private partnerships in infrastructure, health, and SME development, where a mix o f public sector
interventions and investment and TA to private companies are required.

28.

The Bank Group will meet i t s objectives through a range o f available instruments:
0

e

Bank instruments include: (i)knowledge support: diagnostic surveys, knowledge creation and
dissemination o f best practice - through reports, worltshops, advisory technical assistance; and
(ii)lending instruments: adjustment lending programs (at the state level), investment projects
(State or GoI), guaranteeshsk sharing arrangements, TA loans.
I F C instruments include: equity and long-term debt investments in specific firms, including local
currency loans for sectors like infrastructure and healthcare which do not generate foreign
exchange; guarantees; and technical assistance.

M.o v i n g f r o m diagnostics to implementation, the Bank Group w i l l use the
ICA results to support critical reforms to improve the investment climate in the States in which the Bank
i s actively involved (or about t o be involved) through i t s adjustment lending. The immediate focus will

be o n streamlining and re-engineering business entry and operation procedures, for example, through
introducing “single window” and “deemed” clearances; improving the legal framework, for example
labor laws and laws goveming the sale and transfer o f land; and introducing VAT. The regular updating
o f ICAs, with the responsibility for this increasingly shifted to the Confederation o f Indian Industry: i s
expected to yield an ongoing f l o w o f data on the evolving investment climate across the Indian States, and
this analysis will be used to identify new areas/opportunities for Bank Group assistance in support o f a
better investment climate.

30.

At the level o f GoI, the Bank will selectively use investment lending coupled with analytical and
advisory assistance (AAA) to support private sector development, for example, in the area o f SME sector
development and financing. The proposed Bank operation in this sector, with support f r o m donors, will
focus on improving access to finance by SMEs but also on broader financial sector and industrial policy
issues that affect SME performance and competitiveness. In areas where there i s n o investment lending,
and where reforms need to be led by GoI, the Bank will use i t s program o f analytical and advisory
assistance to respond to Go1 requests for knowledge support to build consensus for key refornis, such as
trade and tariff refomis, FDI regulations, improving corporate restructuring and bankruptcy procedures,

improved financial sector regulation, strengthened financial infrastructure t o ensure better access o f
financing for underserved segments, SOE reform, and competition policy (through a recently approved
IDF grant). IFC, through programs such as SEDF (in North-East India) and FIAS, could provide technical
assistance for more detailed diagnostic work, and to support implementation o f reforms aimed at
improving the investment climate for foreign and domestic investors.

31.
The agenda in the financial sector i s large, and reforms are likely to be
gradual. The strategic focus o f the Bank Group will be o n reforms to: 1) improve the financial sector’s
ability to mobilize and intennediate longer t e r m capital required for private infrastructure, and 11) enhance
the efficiency o f resource allocation towards productive but underserved sectors (such as SMEs, rural
enterprise), while maintaining systemic ~ t a b i l i t y IFC
. ~ will make investments and provide technical
assistance to build capacity in private financial institutions which contribute t o financial deepening and
expansion o f financial services to underserved segments. IFC will also support pioneering t i ansactions,
such as partial guarantees o f b o n d issues, which will help develop financial markets. In addition, IBRD
and I F C may issue Indian rupee bonds. which would contribute to the development o f the long-term bond
market. T o this end, the Bank will aim to build partnerships to support critical reforms.
In addition to the selective use o f investment lending to improve access to finance for
32.
underserved segments such as SMEs and rural households/micro enterprises (see above), t h e Bank could
respond to GoI’s requests through providing AAA to: i)support improved financial regulation,
supervision and legal enforcement; ii)enhance the quality and f l o w o f credit information; iii)help
develop and deepen capital markets, particularly debt markets, which are critical to the mobilization o f
longer-term resources and their efficient allocation for infrastructure investments; iv) accelerate pension
system reforms, which can play an important role not only in resource mobilization and providing longer
term income security, but also, in expanding the institutional base to support the development o f longt e r m savings instruments and deepen the capital markets; v) encourage the developinent and use o f
innovative financial products and instruments (such as insurance products, securitization, etc.) to improve
access to finance for underserved segments and to better manage r i s k s related to natural disasters; vi)

are: (i)

presence. In doing so IFC will focus on providing f i r m s w i t h long-term debt and equity which may not be
available f r o m domestic financial markets, and would add value in the area o f global best practices;
assistance in creating global partnerships and entering n e w markets, where IFC's global presence has an
important role t o play; and advice and technical assistance to companies t o improve the environmental

Based on the state o f sector reforms to date, the best prospects for private participation are in
telecoms, power generation, ports and airports. In telecom and ports, investors have direct access to the
end consumer unlike in power, roads (except where tolled), water, sanitation, and solid waste. The
interface in these sectors has been through the national or subnational government. The perceived risks
are higher and i t has been more difficult to mobilize private capital. The analysis o f the Bank Group i s
that in the power distribution and transmission, road, water and sanitation and solid waste sectors,
involvement o f the private sector needs to be encouraged through a variety o f models including publicprivate partnerships.

35.
The B a n k Group i s w e l l placed to promote PPPs by realizing strong synergies between the Bank
and the IFC to support infrastructure development. The Bank can promote policy, regulatory, and
institutional reforms in the infrastructure sectors to help create a more enabling environment for private
investment. These reforms will be supported through the Bank's state-level adjustment lending and sectorinvestment lending, and should help encourage private entry, mobilize private risk capital and facilitate
competition. IFC will support pioneering private or public-private transactions by: i)providing equity and
long-term debt ; ii)using guarantees and the B-loan p r o g a m to mobilize financing f r o m domestic and
international lenders; iii)developing the local capital markets by introducing credit enhanced long term
bonds and securitizations and iv) assisting domestic and foreign sponsors to pursue opportunities in the
infrastructure sector. IFC could also provide both financing and advisory services to support the transfer
o f public infrastructure assets or their operations and management to the private sector, including water
utilities and power distribution systems, ports and airports.

In the port sector 20 terminals in major ports have been concessioned to the private sector. The
response f r o i n foreign port operators has been good and the efficiency gains in privatized terminals such as the
N h a v a Sheva International Container Tenninal have contributed to the growth and diversion o f traffic. The
N S I C T , w h i c h achieved a growth rate o f 32% per annum over the last few years, illustrates the efficiency gains
that can b e achieved with private sector participation as w e l l as the potential that remains to be tapped. A n e w
concept being tried out in Eimore, Tainil Nadu, i s the concept o f the Landlord Port. In this model, the public
sector sets up the basic port infrastructure facilities and then leases i t out to private operating companies.
Ennore, w h i c h has been in operation for 4 years i s n o w in the process o f bidding out various terminals (cargo,
petroleum products, commodities, containers) to the private sector. In addition there are m i n o r privately
developed ports such as Pipavav and M u n d r a where the domestic private sector developers have taken the lead
and have brought iii international operators as partners.

41.

Debt financing to the privatized port terminals has been available f r o m Indian financial institutions
that have provided close to U S S l b i l l i o n equivalent in funding for t h i s sector. IFC’s role in t h e port sector,
therefore, i s to consider longer term debt and n e w financing instruments (mezzanine debt, securitization o f
financial institution loans) and equity.

where there i s appropriate risk sharing between the government and the private sector, including B O T and
annuity projects that are being converted to long term operations and management contracts.

The focus o f the private sector development strategy in the social sectors will be on health.
44.
Through i t s state level health sector investment operations, Bank assistance could support: (i)Enhanced
regulation o f privately provided health care services; (ii)
Designing and iiiipleiiieiiting effective social
franchising or contracting model for increased private participation in primary healthcare (including
public education and primary curative healthcare services) and non-clinical services; the emphasis will
also be to assist public-private partnerships in contracting with output driven monitoring uroiect design;
and (iii)
Developing an efficient and wide-reaching private health insurance market, and also effective
community-based voluntary private insurance plans.
45.
Complementing the Bank’s w o r k with the national and state governments, I F C could contribute
to the development o f the private health sector by directly supporting private providers: continuing to
pursue investments with top-tier facilities. I F C will also explore opportunities w i t h second-tier
institutions-recognizing that many will require substantial technical assistance in terms o f both financial
and clinical practices-and
begin to explore opportunities in diagnostic and ambulatory care facilities.
I F C will continue to pursue investments in pharmaceutical and biotech companies, either directly or
through investment funds. This may include investments in companies which are developing new
products or cheaper production processes which can assist in the control o f infectious diseases.

46.
Reforms to support agricultural productivity, and particularly those that benefit siiiall farmers.
would likely have a multiplier effect on the rest o f the Indian economy, by attracting greater private
investment and improving productivity in agro-industry and other non-farm sectors. These objectives
, dialogue
will be actively pursued through policy dialogue with states. At the
could include focus on improved rural access to finance (including microfinance), a key ingredient o f
promoting rural growth and productivity, and improving livelihoods. These opportunities could be
pursued by the Bank through a rural finance investment operation that capitalizes o n the existing branch
network o f rural banks while leveraging o n innovative financial delivery models and practices that have
evolved in the private sector (including micro finance), building o n a recently completed AAA I F C will
continue to seek opportunities to support financial institutions expanding in rural areas, including finance
for small and micro-enteryrises.

47.

I F C can also support companies in agriculture, agri-processing and agricultural input supply that
expand their operations. Priorities will be on projects that: (i)
improve the efficiency o f food supply
chains; (ii)
have a broader development impact by providing quality inputs and services or integrating the
production o f local farmers into commercial supply chains; and (iii)
introduce resource-saving
technologies. Such support m a y involve TA or mobilization o f financing, as well as community
development activities. This can both strengthen the competitive position o f the processing firms, and
help to strengthen the rural economy.

Portfolio Improvement Strategy

1.
Background. India’s ongoing portfolio performance declined in F Y 0 3 after five years o f sustained
improvement in most quality indicators and showed mixed results in F Y 0 4 (Annex 2 provides additional detail).
The F Y 0 4 disbursement ratio reached 19.9 percent, which i s slightly below the Bank average o f 2 1.4 percent and
the ratio for other large borrowers such as China (22.7 percent) and Indonesia (27.2 percent). As a result o f more
candid reporting as evident f r o m a higher realism index (90 percent in F Y 0 4 compared to 75 percent in FY03), the
percentage o f projects-at-risk increased to 16 percent in FY04, compared to 11 percent in FY03 and the Bank-wide
average o f 16 percent. In order to support the strategy for scaling up Bank support to India, the Bank and Go1
undertook intensive dialogue during F Y 0 4 o n ways to improve the portfolio and agreed o n a Portfolio Improvement
Strategy, the implementation o f which began in mid-FY04 and will continue into FYO5 and beyond.
2.

Portfolio Improvement Strategy. Implementation o f the Portfolio Improvement Strategy has involved
restructuring o f slow disbursing projects and projects that were closing in F Y 0 4 with large un-disbursed balances.
The end-FY04 targets were set as follows: (i)
lowering the proportion o f projects-at-risk and the comiiiitiiieiits-atrisk to below 10 percent; (ii)maintaining realism and proactivity indices to 80 percent (minimum); (iii)reaching a
disbursement ratio o f at least 17 percent; and (iv) to the extent possible, having n o overage projects (i.e., 8 years or
more) and n o backlog o f audit reports. To monitor progress in achieving these targets, scorecards were developed
and widely disseminated for: (i)
each sector, outlining sector-specific minimum action plans and performance
targets; and (ii)
each state and centrally-sponsored scheme. The strategy, agreed with GoI, envisages corrective
actions, some o f which were aimed at bringing short-term benefits (paragraph 3 below) and others at leading to a
better future portfolio (paragraph 4 below).

3.

Portfolio actions with short-term benefits. These were developed o n four fronts, as follows:

(i)At the Central Department of Ecoizoinic Affairs (DEA)/Baizk level, closer monitoring by both i s

required through:
a. Jointly preparing the annual CPPR and conducting semi-annual reviews to monitor progress in
meeting the CPPR targets.
b. Changing the CPPR preparation cycle for delivery in July o f each year, to give sufficient t i m e to
implement action plans.
c. Continuing regular consultations, sharing portfolio performance ratings and “exceptions and
outliers” reports o n a monthly basis, and rigorously using sector/project performance indicators.
d. Jointly reviewing projects-at-risk o n a quarterly basis; if a project remains in r i s k status for more
than one quarter, inviting project authorities to the semi-annual portfolio review meeting.
e. In addition to the regular Bank supervision missions, conducting desk reviews to be carried out by
DEA and the Bank in the intervening quarter for a l l extended projects.
f. Processing requests for closing date extensions only after Sector Portfolio Performance Reviews
(SPPRs) have been completed and action plans for restructuring, reallocation and/or cancellation
agreed upon.
g. Strengthening in-country capacity (at DEA, line ministries and/or major borrowing states, as
applicable) b y : (i)
working with DEA’s Project Management Unit and using DEA’s o w n systems to
monitor and evaluate results (possibly for all externally-funded projects) to help in reporting project
outcomes and supporting requests for future funding; and (ii)helping to share implementation
experience among l i n e ministries, states, and project teaidentities.
h. Reviewing and analyzing the outcomes o f active and recently closed projects (starting w i t h projects
in Health and Rural Development), to develop well-structured and targeted communications
regarding the effectiveness o f the Bank’s assistance to India’s development.
i. M o r e rigorously filtering new projects for implementation readiness (including avoiding ovei-Iy
ambitious development objectives; up-front mobilization o f project stakeholders; up-front
institutional and capacity building actions that are critical for implementation; procurement
readiness; simpler project designs in the context o f weak implementation capacity; and i f
Pnge I of 3

applicable, mandating piloting during preparation). Preparation t i m e for investment projects nil1 be
closely monitored and preparation time in excess o f 12 months will need to be justified.
(ii)At the State Level: Conducting annual multi-sectoral portfolio reviews for borrowing states that haye a
large number o f under-performing projects. These state reviews would also cover projects under
preparation.
(iii)
At the Line Ministry/Sector/Project level:
a. Bringing peer reviewers f r o m within and outside the Bank to enhance supervision quality.
b. Conducting quarterly informal reviews to develop supervision strategies for coiiiplexirisky projects
(on an as-needed basis).
c. Conducting SPPRs for the following sectors having a high concentration o f slow disbursing
projects and implementing SPPR-recommended action plans for restructuring, cancellation and reallocation o f unused funds, These sectors are Rural Development, Education, Health, Poverty
Reduction and Economic Management, and Transport.
(iv)At the Bank Level:
limit the length o f aide-memoires, which were simply too long and
a. Advising task teams to: (i)
inadequately focused o n key issues o f importance for decision making by management and
government officials; and (ii)include in supervision aide-memoires information on project
procurement, commitment, and disbursement expected in the coming 12 months.
b. Strengthening capacity through: (i)mobilizing experienced senior staff to strengthen frontline
leadership and for business development and delivery; and (ii)
providing customized operational
training to Delhi-based staff and project authorities in the Delhi Office.
c. Utilizing Project Status Reports (PSRs) as a more effective management tool to: (ij convey critical
messages to the project teams o n h o w to deal with the issues faced; (ii)
monitor more frequently
implementation o f agreed supervision actions; (iii)
identify warning signs and cost savings; ( i v j
allow timely restructuring, re-allocation or cancellation; and (v) reinforce the use o f perforinance
indicators.
d. Monitoring closely PSR ratings by management, as a number o f poorly disbursing projects are not
rated as problem projects, suggesting a possible realism issue.
e. Addressing cross-cutting issues through, for example, "thematic supervision" or assessment and
discussion with relevant sector or authorities.
f. Ensuring adherence by the task team to business standards, i.e. candidly reporting supervision
results and providing timely feedback to the clients. In the matrix management environment,
improvement in portfolio performance will require sector units to be held accountable for the
realism o f ratings, proactivity, and increased decentralization o f task management, while the
country management unit i s held accountable for overall portfolio performance, selectivity, closing
date management, and cross-cutting issues.

4.

Actions for a better future portfolio. These include the following:

(i) Financial Management. Financial management actions are needed at the central/state level as \veil as at
the project level. SFAAs - which have been completed in four states-Karnatalta, UP, Orissa, and A P are designed to enhance the knowledge o f financial management and accountability ai-rangements
governing the use o f public funds, and to support a process o f institutional reform, capacity building
and financial accountability at central, state and local governments levels, as w e l l as in public sector
undertakings. There i s also considerable scope t o improve project performance by building financial
management strengthening components into the design o f individual investment loans. Borrov,er
performance within existing projects can be strengthened directly through training in Bank procedul-es.
A variety o f training events were organized through local educational institutions in 2003-04. One o f
the objectives has been to enable local educational institutions to provide good quality training through
training o f trainers. The new B a n k policy o n financial reporting and auditing offers considerable scope
for simplifying accounting, audit, and funds f l o w arrangements for Bank projects. The Bank will seek
opportunities to simplify procedures wherever possible, working with the relevant ministries,

departments and agencies responsible, and with other donors. Working with DEA, the Bank \\;ill also
try to put in place better procedures for dealing with poorly performing projects, delays in flo\t- o f
funds, backlog o f Statement o f Expenditures, and ineligible expenditures. All o f the financial
management actions can be expected to have a long-term beneficial impact o n portfolio performance.

(ii) Procurement. A C P A R was completed for India in three phases, focusing o n the central goveminent
and i t s agencies, three sample states (Karnataka, Tamil N a d u and UP), and about 250 Central PSUs.
The CPAR recommendations have been included as one o f the inputs to the Committee appointed by
Go1 for reviewing procurement norms indicated in the General Financial Rules and suggesting
modifications thereof. The C P A R recommendations are also being implemented in Kamataka and
T a m i l Nadu, and are being pursued in AP, Orissa, and Punjab.
(iii) Social Safeguards, The Bank will assist national/state authorities and project entities to identify the

implementation mechanisms best suited to improve social development outcomes o f Bank-financed
operations, such as security and risk management, inclusion, social colzesion, and accoitntability
W h i l e avoiding o r mitigating negative impacts must remain a primary concern for some Bankoperations, the B a n k will f o l l o w a new approach - not imposing requirements that are irrelevant, but
mutually agreed safeguard standards for successful poverty reduction, and ensuring transparency and
accountability t o c i v i l society. With increased future lending, the B a n k will move from ring-fenced
operations towards building o n India's o w n capacity and procedures. Therefore, the Bank will engage
with GO1 in a dialogue o n differences between the Bank's and India's o w n resettlement, land
acquisition, and tribal development policies and practices. I t will also identify the potential net
development gains f r o m addressing any inconsistencies through, for example, better dispute-resolution,
incentives, training, policies, or procedures. The Bank will also w o r k with counterparts in India to set
clear protocols to monitor performance o n resettlement and related issues in each type o f operation, and
link achievements to incentives for improved outcomes. "Sectoral" social assessment will be conducted
f o r multiple projects (such as rural roads and nationalhtate highways) in the lending pipeline, to
effectively address cross-cutting/generic issues. An accountability strategy will be developed to better
communicate to the public the social development outcomes o f Bank-financed projects.

(iv) Szpportfor Public-Puivnte Pautnership(PPP) Aspects of Projects. An increasing number o f Bank
projects in sectors ranging f r o m physical infrastructure to the delivery o f health and education n o w
emphasize the importance o f and need for PPPs. The staff o f the South Asia's Finance & Private Sector
Development Unit can play an important role in working with project teams to identify opportunities
for PPPs within each project, assist with design and implementation o f the PPP in question and, if
necessary, support the project through identifying sector specific reforms required for the success o f
PPPs or developing sector-specific guidelines for the appraisal and negotiation o f PPP contracts. These
staff could also participate in the supervision of existing projects to examine the scope for
strengthening the corporate governance, organization, and financial sustainability o f existing project
managementhmplementationstructures.
