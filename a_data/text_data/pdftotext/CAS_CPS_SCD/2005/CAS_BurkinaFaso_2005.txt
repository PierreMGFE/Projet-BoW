BURKINAFASO:
COUNTRYASSISTANCESTRATEGY FYO6-09
EXECUTIVESUMMARY
1.
Burkina Faso’s track record on reform and growth in the past decade has been laudable, with real
GDP increasing by an average o f 5.6 percent per annum in the 1994-2004 period, accelerating to more
than 6.0 percent per annum in recent years. This has resulted in an estimated 8 percent decline in the
poverty headcount between 1998 and 2003 -- led by cotton-producing rural areas. This recent progress i s
in marked contrast to previous decades o f policy variability and poor growth that have left Burkina one o f
the poorest countries in Afi-ica, with per capita income o f $350 and a poverty incidence o f 46 percent in
2003. Social welfare indicators lag behind even modest Sub-Saharan averages, placing Burkina near the
bottom o f the Human Development Index. T w o o f every five children are malnourished and are not
attending school.
Long-term vision for growth and poverty reduction. T h e country’s landlocked location, limited
2.
resource base, small internal market (12.4 million inhabitants) and undiversified economy -- in which
cotton exports continue to provide 55-70 percent o f export earnings -- shape the long-term vision for
growth and poverty reduction. T o attain the six percent plus real growth rates needed to significantly
reduce poverty, the country needs to pursue a vision based on regional economic integration, agricultural
diversification and intensification, land and ‘water management for enhanced productivity, agroprocessing, trade and export enhancement, human capital and labor productivity, and global connectivity.
Regional economic integration will be critical for reducing transport and energy costs, expanding markets
for trade, taking advantage o f economies o f scale in processing activities, developing viable service
industries, promoting foreign direct investment, enhancing the quality o f advanced education and
encouraging labor mobility. Burkina will also need to make optimal use o f i t s limited natural resource
base to expand export earnings, exploiting the potential to diversify into higher-value agricultural crops,
develop extractive industries, promote a nascent eco-tourism industry and -- with sufficient human capital
development -- become a hub for sub-regional provision o f economic services.
Revised poverty reduction strategy. Burkina’s long-term vision i s the foundation for the
3.
country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. In 2000, Burkina became one o f the first countries to prepare a
full poverty reduction strategy, or Cadre Stratdgique de Lutte contre la Pauvretd (CSLP).’ A revised
CSLP for 2004-2006 was discussed at a Donor Roundtable in March 2004, adopted by Government in
November 2004 and presented to the World Bank Board along with a fifth Poverty Reduction Support
Operation in M a y 2005. The revised CSLP builds on the main objectives o f the earlier strategy, aiming
to: i)accelerate equity-oriented growth; ii)increase access o f the poor to basic social services; iii)expand
income and employment opportunities for the poor; and iv) promote good governance. It sets out three
overarching medium-term goals: to increase real GDP per capita by at least 4 percent per annum
beginning in 2004; to reduce poverty incidence from 46 percent to less than 35 percent by 2015; and to
raise life expectancy to at least 60 years by 2015 through reductions in infant, child and maternal
mortality.
Near-term growth prospects. T h e Burkinabe economy i s vulnerable to a variety o f exogenous
4.
shocks that undermine prospects for growth in the short term. The current downturn in world cotton
prices and appreciation o f the Euro to the U.S. dollar poses a serious risk to Burkina’s cotton-dependent
economy. Last year’s regional locust infestations continue to threaten agricultural production and food
security. Instability in neighboring countries in recent years has undermined regional integration efforts,

increased transport costs and tarnished the investment climate across the sub-region. Faced with multiple
shocks, the Burkinabt? economy i s expected to grow by only 3.5 percent in real terms in 2005.
5.
Lessons from past support to Burkina. The 2000 Country Assistance Strategy supported
implementation o f the initial CSLP. The CAS Completion Report annexed to this CAS concludes that
development outcomes in this period were satisfactory, as was Bank performance in supporting
implementation o f the strategy. Key lessons from the past CAS have shaped the strategy for FY06-09.
First, strong country commitment and consistent policy reform have succeeded in creating an
environment more conducive to growth. Second, a more aggressive approach to economic diversification
and administrative decentralization will be required in order to accelerate growth and make it more
inclusive. Third, the CAS needs to do more to support strengthening o f national capacity and country
systems, in order to get better results and sustain them. Finally, IDA and other external partners must use
the next few years to translate principles of harmonization into reality, in order to reduce the burden o f aid
management for Burkma.
6.
IDA’Spartnership with Burkina in FY06-09. T h i s CAS will support the pillars o f the revised
CSLP with analytic work, technical advice, on-going operations and new financing. I t i s built around a
results framework that explicitly defines the assumed causal links between IDA-supported activities,
direct outcomes o f these activities and the country’s higher-level development outcomes. IDA will seek
to contribute to the following outcomes:
0

0

0

Accelerated and shared growth. IDA will support enhanced regional integration, expanded
and diversified export earnings, an improved investment climate, decentralized urban
development to promote urban-rural linkages, and economic infrastructure needed to reduce
factor costs and stimulate private sector investment and growth.
Improved access to basic social services. IDA will continue to support access to basic
education and improved quality o f teaching, expanded coverage o f basic health care and
HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment and increased access to clean water and sanitation,
particularly in urban areas. IDA will also provide technical input for better targeting o f social
protection to the most vulnerable groups.
Increased employment and income opportunities for the poor. A two-pronged approach
will focus, first, on the labor market and employment strategy for urban workers. Second,
IDA will support efforts to reduce risk, increase revenues, upgrade economic and market
infrastructure and enhance women’s opportunities in rural areas, along with promoting
community-based land and natural resource management for sustainable development.
Better governance with greater decentralization. Governance affects the achievement o f
development outcomes across all strategic pillars and sectors. Efforts to enhance governance
and accountability will be integral to all IDA-supported activities. Particular emphasis will
be placed on supporting a more efficient judiciary, promoting public resource management
and increased decentralization and strengthening local capacity and participation in public
policy decisions.

7.
IDA instruments and indicative financing. The proposed country program will rely less on
traditional project approaches, delivering support increasingly through four instruments: participatory
analytic work, expanded development policy lending, sector-wide approaches and community-driven
development mechanisms. Indicative IDA resources for FY06-09 o f US$140 million per annum are
envisioned, which would contribute to projected real GDP growth o f 4.8 percent per annum.
Improvement in policy and portfolio performance would favor access to a higher level o f external

- iv -

financing during the CAS period -- from IDA as well as other partners. T h i s could help accelerate growth
in Burkina to as much as 6.0 percent per annum if coupled with vigorous implementation o f reforms. The
Burkinabk Govemment enters the CAS period with a strong and demonstrated commitment to reform that
merits a higher volume o f resources.

8.
Conclusion. Burkina Faso faces some daunting challenges and risks during the upcoming CAS
period, not least o f which i s the uncertain evolution o f the world market price for cotton, which places a
premium on overcoming long-standing obstacles to economic diversification. Instability in neighboring
countries will likely continue to hinder regional integration efforts. Despite a less favorable environment
for growth, the country remains committed to prudent macroeconomic management and intensified
structural reforms t o stimulate growth and reduce poverty. Generous and predictable support from IDA
and the international community i s warranted to help this good performer absorb multiple exogenous
shocks in the near term and accelerate progress toward the MDGs in the medium-term.

Board discussion. The following issues are suggested for discussion by the Executive Directors:

Does the proposed country program adequately contribute to achievement o f priority
objectives outlined in Burkina's revised PRSP?

To what extent have lessons learned from implementation o f the previous CAS been
incorporated in the proposed program?

COUNTRY
ASSISTANCESTRATEGY FYO6-09
I.

COUNTRYCONTEXTAND VISION

1.
From independence through revolution. In the two decades after independence (1 960- 1980),
the landlocked, former French colony o f Haute Volta sustained growth o f real per capita income of 1.2
percent per annum. In 1982, the country entered a revolutionary phase and was renamed Burkina Faso.2
Economic policies were modeled on Pan-African socialist theory, and included a strong emphasis on
investment in human development, food self-sufficiency, equitable income distribution and
nationalization o f private sector entities. Food production expanded and strong progress was made in
literacy and basic education. The revolution also instilled a greater sense o f national identity, increased
country ownership o f the development process, reliance on participatory approaches and an emphasis on
personal responsibility and accountability that have served the country well in years since. However,
poor macroeconomic and fiscal management, as well as policies discouraging private sector investment,
had serious consequences for growth. An overvalued currency within the common currency zone
exacerbated this problem, and real per capita growth from 1980 to 1994 (a turning point in which the
currency was devalued by 50 percent) was a dismal -0.5 percent per annum.

Rectification and reform. A change o f regime in 1987 launched a “rectification” o f the
2.
revolution, including a shift toward more market-oriented economic policies and re-engagement with the
international community. The Government o f President Blaise CompaorC-who was elected in 1991 and
again in 1998 -- implemented policies o f trade, market and price liberalization with support for structural
reform from the World Bank and other development partners. Although growth began to accelerate
following the devaluation, available data indicate little change in poverty incidence in the late 199Os, as
well as stagnant social indicators on health and education through the 1990s. Weak growth over more
than three decades also resulted in an unsustainable debt overhang by the late 1990s when Burkina Faso
became one o f the f i r s t countries eligible for the Highly-Indebted Poor Countries initiative.
3.
Recent progress. Burkina’s track record on reform and growth since 1994 has been laudable,
with real GDP increasing by an average o f 5.6 percent per annum in the 1994-2004 decade, despite
continued vulnerability to exogenous shocks. Per capita income growth increased over previous periods
to around 2.6 percent per annum, contributing to an estimated 8 percent decline in the poverty headcount
between 1998 and 2003 -- led by cofion-producing rural areas.3 Despite this recent progress, Burkina
remains one o f the poorest countries in Africa, with per capita income o f $350 and a poverty incidence o f
46 percent in 2003. For i t s 12.4 million inhabitants, many social welfare indicators lag behind modest
Sub-Saharan averages and childhood malnutrition seems to be o n the rise, despite stable measures o f
inequality in the past decade o f growth.
Long-term vision. Burkina Faso‘s poverty reduction strategies are rooted in an earlier
4.
Sustainable Human Development Strategy and the Burluna 2025 visioning exercise conducted in 1998.
The country’s landlocked location, limited resource base, small intemal market and undiversified
economy -- in which cotton exports continue to provide 55-70 percent o f export eamings -- shape the
long-term vision for growth and poverty reduction. T o attain the six percent plus real growth rates needed
to significantly reduce poverty, the country needs to pursue a long-term vision based on regional
Burkina Faso translates as “the land o f people with integrity”.
To measure poverty trends, the government has conducted household surveys in 1994, 1998, and 2003 to collect
information o f household consumption and incomes. Over time, the data collection process has improved, but
changes made to survey design have also reduced the comparability o f different surveys, thus the need to
construct a comparable measure for household welfare to best assess changes in poverty.

economic integration, agricultural diversification and intensification, land and water management for
enhanced productivity, agro-processing, trade and export enhancement, human capital and labor
productivity, and global connectivity. Regional economic integration across historic and linguistic
divides will be critical for reducing transport and energy costs, expanding markets for trade, taking
advantage o f economies o f scale in processing activities, developing viable service industries, promoting
foreign direct investment, enhancing the quality o f advanced education and encouraging labor mobility.
Burkina will also need to make optimal use o f i t s limited natural resource base to expand export earnings,
exploiting the potential to diversify into higher-value agricultural crops, develop extractive industries,
promote a nascent eco-tourism industry and become a hub for sub-regional provision o f economic
services. The latter will take time, requiring a sustained commitment and efficient public spending for
human capital development, coupled with investment in world-class infrastructure and information
technology for global competitiveness and connectivity.

BURKINAFASO’S
POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY

5.
In 2000, Burkina became one o f the first countries to prepare a full Poverty Reduction Strategy,
or Cadre Stratdgique de Lutte contre la Pauvretd (CSLP).4 Progress Reports have been produced for
each year o f the initial CSLP.’ Updating o f the CSLP began in early 2003, and included decentralized
preparation o f 13 regional CSLPs as inputs to the national level strategy, as well as increased participation
o f the private sector, c i v i l society groups and parliamentarians. The draft CSLP for 2004-2006 was
formally discussed at a Donor Roundtable in Ouagadougou in March 2004. On the basis o f this draft, a
Priority Action Plan (PAP) was prepared to better translate strategic direction into sequenced actions and
strengthen results-based monitoring and evaluation o f the CSLP. The revised CSLP and accompanying

PAP were adopted by Government in November 2004, and presented to the World Bank Board along
with the fifth Poverty Reduction Support Credit in M a y 2005.

A. Country Priorities and Progress

6.
The initial CSLP defined the following four strategic pillars: 1) accelerating equity-oriented
growth; 2) guaranteeing access o f the poor to basic social services; 3) expanding employment and income
opportunities for the poor; and 4) promoting good governance. Pnority areas were defined within this
broad framework, and included basic education, health, water supply and rural development (including
food security). Public consultations in 2003 to assess progress and update the CSLP confirmed the
continued relevance of the four strategic pillars, and articulated additional priority areas, including private
sector and SME development, protecting the environment, improving living conditions through sanitation
and rural energy, combating HIV/AIDS, improving public safety and building national capacity and
access to information technology. The revised CSLP sets out three overarching medium-term goals: to
increase real GDP per capita by at least 4 percent per annum beginning in 2004; to reduce poverty
incidence from 46 percent to less than 35 percent by 2015; and to raise l i f e expectancy to at least 60 years
by 20 15 through reductions in infant, child and maternal mortality.
This CAS provides a brief overview o f implementation progress to date under the four strategic
7.
pillars. More detailed discussion can be found in the revised CSLP and other recent documenk6
Pillar One: Accelerating Equity-oriented Growth

8.
Export-led growth. Real growth per annum reached 6.0 percent in the 2000-2004 period, through
a combination o f good weather and good management o f the cotton sector, which continues to provide
around two-thirds of export earnings. Government has become a minority shareholder and silent partner
in cotton sector management, while the ginning market has been opened to two new operators in the East
and Central Zones. A pricing mechanism has been used to transfer world market signals to producers
while at the same time reducing volatility and risk for farmers. Production has increased by more than 8
percent per annum in the 1998-2003 period, reaching 550,000 metric tons in 2004. Livestock remained
an important export for Burkina within the region, as well. As a consequence, poverty reduction was
most pronounced in cotton-producing zones, which also experienced increased cereal production. Less
progress has been made in diversifying into other high-value export crops, a key to sustaining and
accelerating growth in the long-run. Mining offers another source o f long-run, export-led growth. In the
past five years, Government revised the legal and regulatory framework for private investment in the
mining sector, while improving the productivity and safety o f artisanal mining. Two foreign-domestic
partnerships have invested in large-scale gold mining, with production expected to begin later in 2005.
With metal prices high, a number o f other investments are also under negotiation.
Liberalization and privatization. Between 1998 and 2003, Government dismantled non-tariff
9.
barriers and reduced tariff protection in accordance with the WAEMU common customs union. In the
rural sector, IDA increasingly supported private actors and public-private partnerships for the delivery o f
agricultural services. Privatization o f 41 state-owned enterprises has been completed, with another 2 1
underway. Government has adopted strategies for private sector participation in the electricity and
petroleum sectors, and recently approved a regulatory framework that will establish an independent
regulatory agency and promote private entrants into electricity and petroleum markets. Deregulation o f
the o i l and gas distribution market has allowed the entry o f new operators, the expansion o f the market to

rural areas and improved service quality. Liberalization o f the cellular telephone market has had perhaps
the most visible results, with two new entrants driving prices down and expanding markets into rural
areas. The successful establishment o f ARTEL, the telecoms regulatory agency, i s serving as a model for
other sectors, and transfer o f a majority share o f the national telecommunications agency to private
investors i s expected in early 2006.
10.
Economic infrastructure.
In 2000, Government adopted a transport sector strategy to
systematically upgrade and maintain the priority road network and expand rural feeder roads. T o date,
1,120 km have been upgraded or maintained. The transport sector program has also facilitated the
involvement o f small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) in road rehabilitation and maintenance. After the
collapse o f Air Afi-ique in 2000, Government negotiated open-sky agreements and licenses with half a
dozen airlines -- in addition to the four carriers already serving Burkma -- to avoid disruption and provide
greater opportunities for passenger traffic and perishable exports. Government has also pursued a strategy
to lower electricity costs in the medium-term (currently around 22 cents per kwh) by adopting least-cost
system expansion options, and relying on increased imports through the West Africa Power Pool.
Upcoming investments in the Cote-d’Ivoire-Ouagadougoutransmission line are an important element o f
this strategy.
Investment climate. In addition to the above areas o f reform, the Burkinabb authorities have
11.
taken measures to improve the general environment for doing business, harmonizing and reducing
customs duties and corporate taxation, establishing an enterprise promotion agency (Maison ,de
1’Entreprise), harmonizing business law within the O H A D A fi-amework, creating a permanent publicprivate sector dialogue and establishing separate commercial chambers within the courts. A workshop
held in February 2005 reviewed data on Doing Business in Burkina and underscored the scope for
Government has made a strong commitment to
additional improvements in the investment ~ l i m a t e . ~
moving faster and farther in this area in coming years, and the Bank’s country assistance strategy will
seek to provide greater analytic and financial support for these essential reforms.
Pillar Two: Guaranteeing Access of the Poor to Basic Social Services
Basic education. Progress since 2000 in expanding access to basic education has been
12.
encouraging, albeit insufficient to achieve MDG targets. Government adopted the ten-year Basic
Education Development Strategy (PDDEB) in 2000, garnering wide support from the donor community
for implementation. Use o f a rolling, medium-term expenditure framework was introduced for planning
and donor alignment, and a decision was taken to focus Government‘donor intervention in the 20
provinces with lowest primary enrollment rates. A national program was adopted to accelerate girls’
education, and public-private partnerships to expand secondary education were piloted and replicated
based on early successes. The result has been acceleration o f improvements in gross intake rates,
enrollment rates and completion rates at the primary level, and expanded enrollment at the secondary
level, as well. The gap between boys and girls enrollment has narrowed modestly, although the gross
primary enrollment rate in 2004 (52 percent) remains well below the Sub-Saharan average. In addition,
the gap between the 20 focus provinces and the rest o f the country has widened -- reflecting perhaps
differential economic growth or less efficient spending. Raising the efficiency o f education spending i s o f
highest priority in coming years.
Health and nutrition. A ten-year National Health Development Strategy was adopted in 200 1.
13.
A Health Sector Monitoring Committee involving civil society and external partners was established in

2003 to assess progress in implementation o f the strategy. Preventive services and affordable care have
improved, with free access to vaccinations and prenatal care, and lower-priced essential drugs. This
strategy has contributed to improved immunization coverage and increased utilization o f prenatal services
and primary care facilities. A pooled funding mechanism has been developed to channel resources
directly to health districts on the basis of monitorable action plans, and this approach will be extended to
hospitals in 2005. A first medium-term expenditure framework i s being prepared along with a human
resources action plan to alleviate severe staffing constraints, particularly in rural areas. Government’s
strategy, coupled with sustained economic growth, has contributed to improvements in health status since
2000, following a decade o f stagnation. Infant and child mortality rates have fallen, while the share o f
assisted births has risen. However, nutritional status has seemingly not improved, with 38 percent o f
children considered underweight and chronically malnourished. Malaria -- the greatest cause o f
childhood mortality -- remains inadequately addressed and under-funded.
14.
HIWAIDS. A National AIDS Council, chaired by the President, and a national strategy were
established in 2001. The country has since significantly scaled up HIV/AIDS prevention and care
activities, including supporting micro-projects in more than 3,500 villages, action plans in 22 ministries
and care and support activities o f more than a thousand non-governmental and community-based
organizations. Recent data indicate that HIV/AIDS prevalence among young women attending antenatal
clinics has fallen, and condom use by men has increased. More than 2,500 individuals are now
participating in the national ARV treatment program, improving the quality o f life for these individuals
and their children.
Water supply and sanitation. Burkina has made considerable progress in implementing its 1998
15.
National Water Policy and Strategy. In 2000, the population o f Ouagadougou was growing by nearly 5
percent per annum and had begun experiencing severe water shortages. Only about 30 percent o f
households in Ouagadougou had connections-half the rate o f some capital cities in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The national water and sanitation utility (ONEA) had limited scope o f intervention and poor productivity.
Multiple external partners have supported Government in reform o f ONEA, increased expansion o f
Ouagadougou’s water supply, and to a lesser extent private sector participation in the sector. As a result,
between 2001 and 2004, the number o f active connections in Ouagadougou rose by 20 percent and the
population served by nearly 40 percent. Financial sustainability o f ONEA and the urban water sector has
also improved significantly. However, the situation in other urban centers served by ONEA remains
difficult. Deeper reforms are needed to promote private participation in urban water supply to increase
efficiency, improve tariff policy and reinvest revenues to better serve customers. Beyond urban centers,
surveys indicate anywhere from 35 to 50 percent access to potable water in rural areas, particularly
through community stand pipes. However, quality and reliability o f water services remain poor in semiurban and rural areas, with sanitation services lagging further behind -- and virtually nonexistent in rural
areas.
Pillar Three: Expanding Employment and Income OpportunitiesAmong the Poor

16.
Employment and vocational training. Progress has been sporadic in this domain reflecting the
need for an updated and shared strategy that i s better linked to the growth and poverty reduction agenda.
Measures to date have supported targeted Government programs rather than enhancing the overall
environment for j o b creation. Professional training centers have been rehabilitated and the number o f
students increased. Government has launched national funds for SME and micro-enterprise development,
and has strengthened support services for both. Revisions were made to existing labor laws to enhance
labor market flexibility, although additional progress i s needed. An employment observatory was
established to strengthen national capacity to monitor employment trends and better understand links to
growth and poverty reduction. Updating o f the 1998 Employment Strategy will be undertaken in 2005
and 2006, with an aim to favoring j o b creation over post protection within a more flexible labor market.

-5-

17.
Agriculture and rural revenues. Government has put the accent o n technological solutions -from simple to highly sophisticated-to reduce agricultural risk, increase production and promote
diversification. Efforts have ranged from rainfall management to introducing genetically-modified seeds
to encouraging village composting and community-based investment in treadle pumps and other adapted
technologies for small-scale irrigation. These have helped agricultural production dnve growth and
reduce poverty since 2000. Cotton production doubled, along with increased food crop production.
Farmers’ associations (of which nearly half were among women) demonstrated the substantial potential
for irrigated dry-season production to raise and stabilize rural household incomes. Government also put
in place a micro-credit fund to support small-scale livestock, ago-processing and marketing activities, as
well as a fund channeled through women’s centers to increase women’s access to appropriate technology
and transport in 20 o f the poorest provinces.
18.
Community-driven development. Major strides have been made in moving beyond traditional
state-provided services for rural development. Through i t s National Program for Land Management
(PNGT2) and similar donor-funded initiatives, government has embraced community-driven development
and village empowerment to plan and implement local development programs and protect the
environment. Thousands o f localities have established and trained gender-balanced village committees
that have worked to increase agricultural productivity through anti-erosion projects, water management
and re-introduction o f traditional soil fertilization techniques, as well as a range o f social service projects.
Scaling up community driven development -- and harmonizing donor-driven approaches around a
national model -- are key priorities for the future.
19.
Rural infrastructure. The transport sector strategy has identified 12,000 km o f rural feeder roads
to be constructed or upgraded, o f which about 3,000 lun are under IDA financing. Agricultural marketing
infrastructure has also been a priority. Recently, a fruit and vegetable export facility was opened in BoboDioulasso (with support from IDA) to help exporters meet quality and packaging standards for global
markets. In line with the country’s electrification strategy, government has focused f i r s t on secondary
urban centers that play a key role in linking rural zones to markets and social services. At the same time,
125 departmental centers in rural areas are participating in a renewable energy pilot to introduce solar
panels for priority municipal buildings, social services and public lighting. Expansion o f the national
electricity grid i s not a cost-effective option for much o f rural Burkina -- putting a premium on
development o f alternative and renewable energy sources.
Pillar Four: Promoting Good Governance

20.
Democratic institutions. Since taking power in a coup in 1987, the current regime has gradually
introduced democratic reforms, although political control remains firmly in the hands o f the ruling party.
A national reconciliation process, including compensation for victims o f earlier political violence, has
aimed to enhance unity and build shared vision. Nonetheless, the shadow o f past violence continues to
mark the national consciousness. Alleged interference in the political affairs o f other countries -particularly in the early years o f the regime -- has also undermined i t s reputation in international circles.
Burkina now holds multi-party elections at the executive, legislative and municipal levels, and
Government maintains a permanent dialogue with opposition parties through the National Assembly. The
country adopted a National Strategy on Good Governance in 1998 which i s now being updated, and
established a National Coordination Unit on Good Governance in 2002 for cross-cutting decision-making.
A revised Code on Information has created a more favorable environment for a free press, although selfcensorship and weak capacity remain the rule rather than the exception. Civil society groups have
mobilized increasingly following a National Forum on C i v i l Society in late 2002 and an independent
review o f the revised CSLP in 2003. Building greater trust between government and civil society groups,
and enhancing public access to information, remain areas for further progress.

-6-

21.
Judicial reform and anti-corruption. A National Action Plan to Reform the Judicial System was
adopted in 2000 with the aim o f increasing the independence o f the judiciary and bringing it closer to the
people. Organizational and statutory reforms have been implemented to increase the independence o f
magistrates, create better checks and balances within the Supreme Court system and bring legislation into
alignment with international standards. Despite some progress, corruption and inefficiency are perceived
to be persistent problems o f the judiciary, and lower courts are hampered by weak capacity and
insufficient decentralization, which continue to undermine access to justice. More broadly, corruption i s
perceived as a moderate, but growing, problem in Burhna, which must be combated with a visible and
unambiguous response from government. The country established a High Authority to Combat
Corruption in 2002, and this was accompanied by development o f a National Anti-corruption Network
among civil society organizations. More Government action i s now needed to raise the cost o f corruption
and increase the likelihood o f exposure and sanctions.
Economic governance. Substantial progress has been made with respect to public resource
22.
management, particularly through budgetary reform. The government’s Program to Strengthen Budget
Management (PRGB) was adopted in 2002. Implementation progress has included: a) adoption o f the
legislative framework for budget deconcentration; b) initial deconcentration o f payment orders;
c) introduction o f program budgeting and medium-term expenditure frameworks as standard budgeting
tools; d) establishment of the Supreme Audit Institution (Cow des Comptes) for budgetary oversight;
e) submission o f annual budget execution reports to the Supreme Audit Institution; f ) r e f o m o f public
procurement policy to enhance transparency; g) agreement among donors on a common framework for
providing and monitoring budget support; and h) increased budget allocations and improved budget
execution for priority sectors, including health, HIV/AIDS, basic education and rural development.
Continued progress in implementing the PRGB, coupled with improved linkages between strategic
planning and public resource management, will be needed to improve the effectiveness o f government’s
efforts to reduce poverty.
Administrative reform and decentralization. A national plan for the Comprehensive Reform o f
23,
Public Administration was adopted in 1998, although implementation has been limited in scope. Progress
has included some deconcentration o f human resources management to line ministries, adoption o f more
flexible contracting regulations, introduction o f a merit-based evaluation system for civil servants and
gradual extension o f an integrated administrative and payroll information system (SIGASPE). In the late
199Os, government also adopted a policy orientation toward decentralization and deconcentration. Since
then, basic education and health ministries have made some progress within the constraints o f existing
law. However, as in many countries, implementation has faced political resistance and ingrained
disincentives for civil servants. A step forward was taken with the appointment o f 13 regional governors
in 2004. At end-2004, the politically controversial and long-awaited L a w on Local Administration was
passed, providing a clear framework for decentralization that includes establishment o f rural communes in
2005 with locally elected governments. The success o f decentralization will depend o n how well
Government overcomes remaining political resistance and defines and sequences measures to transfer
responsibilities, resources and capabilities to decentralized levels.

B. Recent Economic Developments and Medium-termProspects*
24.
Growth. Real GDP grew at a rate o f 6.0 percent per annum in the 2000-2004 period -- a strong
performance reflecting Burkinabk commitment to reform and astute management o f exogenous shocks.
Growth was led by expansion o f cotton production and exports, and by associated increases in cereal

Board on May 3,2005.

production. Exceptional rainfall in 2003 made it a banner year for agricultural production, with effects on
export earnings and domestic demand that carried into 2004, buoying real growth in industry and services
to above 6 percent. This muted the immediate impact o f shocks arising in the latter half o f 2004, including
regional locust infestation (which reduced livestock export earnings by around 30 percent), renewed
instability in neighboring C6te d’Ivoire, a 30 percent fall in world cotton prices, a 3 1 percent increase in
world petroleum prices and nominal exchange rate appreciation o f around seven percent. As a result o f
these multiple shocks, value-added from the agricultural sector stagnated in 2004, and GDP growth f e l l to
4.8 percent, well below the 6.0 percent targeted in the CSLP. Growth prospects for 2005 are further
constrained, with projected real GDP growth expected to reach about 3.5 percent.
25.
Looking ahead, the base case macroeconomic scenario for Burkina rests on current projections o f
international cotton prices rising modestly from US$0.56 per pound to US$0.60 per pound in 2009, along
with exchange rate stability. Cotton export earnings are expected to increase by around four percent per
annum in real terms, with moderate growth o f non-cotton export earnings as well. On the import side, the
base case assumes moderate softening o f o i l prices in line with current world projections. Assuming no
further deterioration in sub-regional stability, sustained aid flows and continued macro-economic
stability, real GDP growth is expected to average around 4.8 percent per annum in the 2005-2009 period.
26.
A more optimistic scenario assumes more rapid growth o f export earnings, either through
improved cotton prospects or faster growth o f non-cotton exports such as mining and horticulture. This
would likely require higher private investment and increased aid flows. Real GDP growth might rise to as
much as 6.0 percent per annum if such favorable conditions prevail. Growth beyond this i s considered
unlikely within this CAS period due to continued dominance o f cotton exports, even as progress i s made
on economic and export diversification.

Flagging o f government commitment to policy reform and development could result in a wide
variety o f lower case growth scenarios, but this i s considered fairly unlikely. In addition, one can
envision an emergency scenario resulting from further, significant deterioration in the world cotton
market or dollar/Euro exchange rate. Despite Burkina’s continued engagement o n reforms, a more
adverse external environment would affect export earnings and rural incomes, with secondary effects on
domestic demand for goods and services. Additional external financing would be necessary to smooth
consumption, support adjustment and maintain positive growth.
28.
External accounts. Burkina’s terms o f trade declined by a cumulative 20 percent in 2001-2004,
and are expected to decline by a further five percent in 2005. Prudent fiscal and monetary policy (within
the CFAF monetary union) has held inflation to less than 3 percent per annum since 2000, mitigating the
impact o f nominal currency appreciation on the real effective exchange rate. Despite increased volume o f
cotton exports, declining terms o f trade have kept the current account deficit (excluding grants) high, at
around 11-12 percent o f GDP. T o finance this gap, Burkina will continue to rely o n foreign financing,
including aid disbursements and debt relief.

Debt sustainabiZity. As an early entrant into the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
29.
initiative, Burkina received debt relief under both the original and the enhanced HIPC Initiative in the
amount o f US$424 million in end-1999 Net Present Value (NPV) terms. In addition, Burkina also
qualified for a topping-up assistance o f US$129 million in end-2001 NPV terms. T h e total relief
provided reduced the NPV o f Burkina’s outstanding debt by nearly 50 percent at the Completion Point.

30.
Since then, changes in international interest rates and the depreciation o f the US$ have weakened
Burkina’s debt outlook. These adverse factors were only partially offset by more favorable than
anticipated export earnings and lower than anticipated new borrowing. A Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA) conducted by IMF staff indicated that Burkina’s debt outlook has worsened at end-2004 relative to
the projections made at the Completion Point. W h i l e the NPV o f debt to exports ratio had been projected
to stand at 193 percent in 2004, it stood at 207 percent according to the updated DSA, with an expected
decline to 182 percent by the end o f the CAS period.

Burkina’s prospects for debt sustainability continue to hinge o n the strength o f i t s exports
eamings and on the terms o f i t s new borrowing. As an illustration, Figure 1 above shows the evolution o f
debt sustainability based on different scenarios o f exports performance. The current DSA i s consistent
with the base case macroeconomic scenario and assumes nominal growth o f export eamings o f seven
percent per annum in the 2006-2009 period. However, if growth o f nominal export eamings falls
significantly short o f this (as seen in the sensitivity analysis), Burkina will be debt distressed for some
time to come. In either scenario, substantial and highly concessional financing -- including from IDA -will be needed for the foreseeable future to ensure debt sustainability while accelerating growth and
progress towards the MDGs. A joint IMFNVB mission will conduct an update o f the DSA in June 2005
using the new fkamework for assessing debt sustainability o f l o w income countries which was adopted by
the Bank and Fund Boards in March 2005.
Fiscal revenues. Government revenues (excluding grants) have risen from an average o f 11.4
32.
percent o f GDP in 2000-2002 to an average o f 12.4 percent o f GDP in more recent years. This modest
increase reflects improved tax administration, on the one hand, coupled with reduced customs and
corporate rates to stimulate investment, on the other. Nominal revenues have increased by about 33
percent since 2002, compared to only 15 percent for total expenditures and net lending. In 2005, revenues
are projected to rise to 13.2 percent o f GDP, a figure that has been revised downward to take into account
the expected slowdown in economic activity. Despite progress, this rate falls below the average for SubSaharan Africa and the norms established within WAEMU (targeted at 17 percent o f GDP). In future,
efforts will focus o n broadening the tax base, particularly as firms shift into the formal sector.

33.
Expenditure management. Throughout the 200 1-2004 period, the budget has been executed
broadly in line with CSLP objectives and the financial program agreed with the IMF. Nearly half o f all
public expenditures have been financed through extemal flows, increasingly provided as direct budget
support or programmatic funds. Disciplined management has kept the basic balance (revenue excluding

- 10-

grants minus expenditure excluding foreign-financed capital spending) at around 3 percent o f GDP
despite shocks to the economy and unexpected expenditures. At the same time, spending in priority
sectors -- particularly health, HIV/AIDS, education and rural development has been increased as agreed,
with additional support from HLPC resources. Poverty-reducing social expenditures increased from 4.8
percent o f GDP in 2002 to 5.8 percent in 2004. Prospects for the CAS period include gradual
improvement in revenue generation to around 15.2 percent o f GDP, coupled with continued high levels o f
extemal assistance (assuming continued country performance), and expenditure management in line with
resource availability.

C. Challenges Ahead

34.
Given the country context, recent progress and medium-term prospects, the main challenges for
Burkina in the upcoming CAS period can be summarized as follows:
Maintaining commitment to reform despite less favorable conditions for growth.
Flexibility will be needed to address uncertainty about the evolution o f the world cotton
market, and deeper sectoral adjustment will be needed for what may prove to be a long-term
trend. Reforms and targeted investment will be needed to further improve competitiveness in
the cotton sector, as the country pursues long-run ‘diversification. On-going locust invasions
in the sub-region will also pose a threat to agricultural production. In the short-term, subregional instability will continue to complicate the challenge o f regional integration, with its
promise o f bigger markets and expanded training and employment opportunities. Burkina
will also need to fully engage at the international level to influence global policies on trade,
debt and aid. Fragile debt sustainability will be at risk if growth falters in the short-run.
Overcoming long-standing obstacles to economic diversification. With a less favorable
environment for growth, the need to reduce risk and multiply sources o f income in Burkina’s
mono-crop economy becomes more evident. Govemment will need to address structural
impediments-like
the high cost o f energy-and
unleash the potential o f private
entrepreneurs to identify opportunities and take risks. The country will need to make optimal
use o f i t s limited resource base, through water management to develop dry season agricultural
exports, sustainable land management for increased productivity, supportive policies to build
capacity and develop agricultural supply chains, development o f large-scale and artisanal
mining, and positioning o f Burkina as a regional hub for transport and services.
Improving the efficiency of public spending for social services, water and sanitation.
Burkina’s long-run track record on building human capital i s disappointing, and i s reflected
in the country’s rank near the bottom o f the Human Development Index. National trends for
health, education, water supply and sanitation have been encouraging in recent years, but the
accumulated “social deficit” i s huge, and serves to perpetuate poverty and hamper Burkina’s
ability to compete in regional and global markets. To catch up with Africa and the world,
government must deploy scarce resources more strategically, drawing o n partnerships with
the private sector, civil society organizations and communities. More efficient social
spending will require, inter alia, improved expenditure tracking, strengthened ministerial
capacity, decentralized administration, empowered communities, and simple results-oriented
monitoring.
Decentralizing development to enhance pro-poor growth. Recent growth has been good for
the poor in Burkina -- but ensuring that growth translates into improved well-being for the
rural poor i s o f highest priority. Linking rural communities to economic and social service
centers will be key to their greater participation in growth. Creating effective rural-urban

- 11 -

linkages will require decentralized urban development. Transport and market infrastructure,
telecommunications and affordable energy must be matched by improved land and water
management and by greater private sector investment in agricultural supply chains and
processing technology. Decentralized decision-making by empowered communities will be
needed to improve the cost-effectiveness o f social and municipal service delivery, and allow
local populations to better exploit economic opportunities. More inclusive policies -particularly for women -- would improve access to land, appropriate technology and other
inputs for crop and livestock development.
Creating a public sector interface that inspires private sector confidence. The “stroke o f the
pen” reforms that characterized early economic liberalization are largely completed in
Burkina. The task i s now harder, requiring a transformation o f the central state apparatus to
support private-sector led growth and decentralized social service delivery. Sector-specific
reform must be supported by cross-cutting changes in planning and budgeting processes,
public expenditure management, c i v i l service deconcentration and remuneration, public
procurement and monitoring and evaluation systems. The governance requirements for doing
business and creating wealth in Burhna are the same as elsewhere: stable economic and
fiscal policies, efficient public administration, transparent public procurement, clear
ownership rights, timely and uncormpt judicial decisions, adequate contract enforcement,
reliable utilities and technology, and a level playing field for investors. Harnessing the
political will and administrative capacity to make significant progress in these areas will be
one o f Burkina’s greatest challenges.

WORLD BANKGROUP
PARTNERSHIP WITH BURKINAFASO

A. Lessons from the Previous Country Assistance Strategy

35.

The country program identified in the 2000 CAS and 2003 CAS Progress Report was fully
implemented. A CAS Completion Report (CASCR, see Annex 7) provides an assessment o f the
relevance and effectiveness o f this country program. Overall, development outcomes in the period under
review (FY00-04) were satisfactory, as were Bank and Burkinabb performance in implementing the
strategy. Variability in outcomes and performance by sector and theme are documented in the CASCR.
More generally, cross-cutting lessons emerged from implementation o f the last CAS that are now being
taken into account in designing the FY06-09 strategy. These include:
Sustained commitment to sound policies creates the basis for accelerated growth. With
consistent leadership and strong country ownership, Burkina has pursued market-oriented reforms
for more than a decade. Despite i t s many resource and capacity constraints, sound policies and
good economic management have allowed Burkina to sustain growth o f over five percent per
annum for the past decade. The country i s broadly on track -- and deserves international support
to fine-tune strategy and accelerate positive trends to reduce poverty and improve social welfare.
Diversification and decentralization are key to more inclusive growth. Growth in recent years
has benefited the poor, particularly in cotton-producing areas. The upcoming CAS w i l l support
development aimed at reaching into rural areas, allowing rural populations to participate more
fully in growth and access essential social services. The “double Ds” hold the key to pro-poor
growth, by increasing economic opportunities for rural households and empowering communities
to manage municipal and social services.

-12-

Strengthening capacity and country systems will enhance results and sustainability. As the
country moves into a second-generation PRSP and deepening reforms, weak capacity and country
systems remain a stumbling block. Limited capacity in decentralized health facilities and
inefficient public procurement procedures are just two o f many examples. Along with other
external partners, IDA needs to use i t s upcoming CAS to strengthen capacity and country systems
needed to manage the development process.
Progress on simplification and harmonization has lagged behind rhetoric. Use o f the PRSC
instrument to support implementation o f the poverty reduction strategy -- and harmonization o f
budget support among donors -- has been a major benefit for the client. At the sector level,
however, progress has been disappointing in terms o f IDA’s own efforts as well as that o f other
partners. During the upcoming CAS period, task leaders will be given greater incentives to adopt
programmatic approaches based on agreed sector strategies and expenditure frameworks, joint
missions, pooled resources, common procedures, and unified monitoring systems. Progress on
IDA’s simplification and harmonization will be measured in the CAS.

B. Key Features o f the FY06-09 CAS

36.
The Bank i s one o f Burkina Faso’s more prominent partners, not only in terms o f financial
support, but also with respect to analysis, policy advice and presence on the ground. In the next four
years, IDA’SCAS will be characterized by:
0

A stronger focus on results. The results-based methodology which guided CAS
preparation will be carried into implementation, improving the coherence o f overall
strategy, increasing flexibility for mid-course correction, promoting multi-sectoral
solutions to achieving results and enhancing the monitorability and evaluability o f the
CAS itself. The Country Team will continue to organize itself around key outcomes.

e

An increasingly programmatic approach. Transaction costs o f outmoded project
approaches are crippling Burkina’s administration in a number o f areas. IDA has found
programmatic support to be effective, but can go further in applying the Bank’s
simplified country financing parametersg, channeling funds through the PRSC
mechanism and supporting sector strategies with pooled SWAPS,harmonized procedures
and common reporting. Targeted investment operations will be justified in some
instances, particularly to pilot innovations through private sector channels.

e

Enhanced support for country systems and capacity. More than ever, the CAS will be
seen as a tool to strengthen country systems and build capacity to manage for
development results. Sector operations will support development o f country management
and monitoring systems, with cross-cutting operations and analytic work aimed at
strengthening public administration, statistical systems and decentralized management.

C. Strategic Objectives

37.
The revised CSLP provides the framework in which the FY06-09 CAS can contribute to Burkina
Faso’s development objectives. Participatory development o f the CSLP served as strong foundation on
which to carry out narrower consultations in March 2005 aimed at refining the results framework for the
Bank’s support to Burkina. Consultation with the Council o f Ministers was followed by a workshop
Country Financing Parameters for Burkina Faso were established in a note to the Bank’s Board o f Executive
Directors o n January 25,2005. N o revisions have subsequently been made (see Annex 4 for summary sheet).

organizations and external partners. T h i s was followed by sessions with parliamentarians as well as
traditional chiefs and religious leaders. Field visits were carried out for village consultations in three
zones distinguished by geography, climate and ethnicity. From these consultations emerged a sub-set of
country priorities to which the CAS will contribute in order to help achieve strategic objectives reflecting
the four pillars o f the CSLP. These priorities are summarized in Figure 2 (see Annex C for more detailed
diagrams o f the results framework and associated country program).
Strategic Objective 1: Accelerated and Shared Growth

38.
The long-term vision for growth i s -- o f necessity -- built on the basis of integration into a larger
regional market that will help stimulate diversification o f the national economy. T o help Burkina
accelerate growth that i s both inclusive and private-sector driven, the CAS will contribute to the following
outcomes: a) increased regional integration; b) expanded and diversified export earnings; c) an improved
investment climate; and d) more efficient economic infrastructure. IDA will work closely with I F C and
MIGA within the Bank Group to provide a comprehensive service in support o f private sector growth."
1.a. Increased Regional Integration

39.
As a landlocked country of less than 13 million inhabitants, Burkina has a long-term economic
interest in regional integration, and serves as host country for the headquarters o f the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WEAMU). A country the size o f Burkina cannot significantly expand
and diversify its production unless it has access to a larger regional market. Through PRSCs, IDA will
continue to support Burkina in reaching WEAMU macroeconomic convergence criteria and harmonizing
trade and economic policies within the common West A h c a n framework. IDA will also support
investments for regional integration, particularly with respect to infrastructure, energy, financial markets
and agricultural productivity. For infrastructure development, this includes on-going support for regional
collaboration in civil aviation, as well as on-going policy dialogue on regional rail transport and
telecommunications. Planned regional operations that complement the existing portfolio include the
Regional Transit Facilitation Program and West African Power Pool Program, both scheduled for FY08.
In the financial sector, modernization o f the regional payment system i s being led by BCEAO with
support from the World Bank. A real-time settlement system for large payments i s n o w operational, and
an electronic clearing system for mass payments i s expected by end-2005. IDA i s also supporting the
West A h c a n Development Bank with a line o f credit, guarantees and technical support aimed at
strengthening regional capital markets. In terms o f agricultural productivity, Burkina i s already
participating in the African Program to Combat Locust Infestation following last year's crisis, and will
participate in the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) initiated by N E P A D with
IDA support.
I.b. Expanded and Diversified Export Earnings

40.
IDA will contribute to enhancing Burkina's trade prospects within regional and global markets.
An Integrated Trade Framework analysis in FY06 will reinforce the analytic underpinning for secondgeneration reforms in this area. The country program will continue to rely o n a series o f PRSCs to
support growth in a liberalized cotton sector, taking into account likely long-term trends in world market
conditions. The forthcoming Programme d 'Appui aux FiliBres Agro-Sylvo-Pastorales (PAFASP) will
support productivity enhancement in the cotton sector while promoting diversification. Future PRSCs
will deepen the emphasis on private sector growth and development introduced in PRSC4 (July 2004),
lo

including through a new emphasis on development o f secondary urban areas critical for rural production
and marketing. At the same time, IDA will build on i t s earlier support for farmers’ organizations and
small-scale irrigation which have contributed to increased crop production. A new IDA-supported sector
program (Programme d ’Appui aux FiliBres Agro-Sylvo-Pastoral, PAFASP) will develop private sector
channels to intensify production, increase competitiveness and diversify commercial agriculture while
alleviating constraints to marketing and ago-processing. Special emphasis will be placed on women
farmers’ access to appropriate technology, inputs and markets.

I.c.Improved Investment Climate
41.
IDA’S on-going support for private sector development (Projet d’Appui h la Compdtitivitd et le
Dkveloppement des Entreprises, PACDE) will contribute to strengthening the Enterprise Promotion
Agency, establishing a one-stop shop for investment formalities, speeding and enforcing commercial
court decisions, and providing technical support for privatization and private sector regulation. In
addition, the program will support access to credit for small and medium enterprises, in collaboration with
the IFC. In early 2005, PACDE supported analysis related to Doing Business in Burkina, identifying
reforms needed to reduce the time and cost o f business registration and liquidation, improve enforcement
o f contracts and increase the flexibility o f the labor market. These reforms will be integrated and
sequenced into the PRSC 6-9 series along with other recommended measures arising from participatory
analytic work in this area. IDA will support an Investment Climate Assessment and a Financial Sector
Review in FY06 to assist government in further defining the medium-term agenda.
1.d. More efficient Economic Infrastructure

42.
IDA will continue to support privatization and increased private sector participation in the
electricity, petroleum and telecommunications sectors through the PACDE and PRSC instruments.
Privatization o f the telecommunications para-statal and implementation o f the regulatory framework in
the power and petroleum sectors are immediate priorities. The on-going portfolio i s well-positioned to
contribute to Burkina’s efforts to increase reliability and reduce the costs o f electricity and transport. The
Power Sector Development Project (PSDP) joins with four other partners for urgently needed investments
in domestic power generation and construction o f the transmission line from C8te d’Ivoire through BoboDioulasso to Ouagadougou. I t also supports the Government in strengthening the legal, regulatory and
institutional framework for private investment and implementation o f a least-cost energy access program.
IDA’S second operation in support o f Burkina’s Transport Sector Program (PST2) i s part o f a broad
coalition o f donors (of which IDA, the AfDB and the EU are the largest contributors) contributing to the
upgrading and maintenance o f the priority road network and to expanding rural feeder roads.
43.
Economic and market infrastructure in secondary urban areas will also be supported by IDA, such
as the planned slaughter house in Bobo-Dioulasso aimed at increasing livestock exports. WBI will
complement these efforts by helping government identify options for private participation in
infrastructure and instruments for the mitigation o f risks related to development o f infrastructure projects.
At the sector level, WBI will strengthen the capacity o f telecommunication regulators to implement
universal access policy and support implementation o f the country’s MDG Action Plan for municipal
water supply through knowledge sharing on issues such as contracting o f local water providers. WBI’s
support for infrastructure regulation and management will be provided in partnership with the African
Capacity Building Foundation.

Strategic Objective 2: Improved Access to Basic Social Services

44.
T o support progress toward Burkina’s human development goals, the CAS will contribute to:
a) improved access to, and quality of, basic education particularly for girls and in underserved provinces;
b) improved access to, and quality of, health, nutrition, and HIV/ATDS prevention and care services;
c) increased access among the poor to potable water and sanitation services; and d) a better targeted social
protection strategy.
2. a. Improved Access to, and Quality oJ Basic Education

45.
PRSP objectives include expanding access to education services among the poor by increasing
coverage of basic education; improving the quality o f education; developing more effective literacy
programs for adults, especially women; and establishing a better equilibrium within the education system
that would respond in both quantity and quality to the needs o f the economy. Through the on-going Basic
Education Sector Program, IDA has joined with other donors in supporting Government in the
implementation o f the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of Basic Education (PDDEB). The BESP will
be restructured at mid-term, however, to promote a more harmonized subsector-wide approach among
donors, including pooled funds and common procedures and reporting requirements. Already, donor
support -- including IDA support -- aims to help Burkina Faso better target investments in education,
particularly to provinces with the lowest enrollment rates and greater gender imbalances, through school
construction programs and public-private partnerships at the local level for more decentralized and
efficient school management. Quality enhancement i s being pursued through improved textbook
availability, teacher in-service training and increased real teaching and learning time -- as well as
promoting learning assessments for primary and secondary students through development o f standardized
testing and improved data collection and analysis.
46.
A recently-closed IDA-funded Post-Primary Education Project supported an innovative publicprivate partnership (PPP) model for expansion o f secondary education which will be replicated by
Government, with likely support from other donors. Successful implementation o f PDDEB would allow
IDA to follow up with an Education SWAP toward the end o f the CAS period. In addition, IDA may be in
a position to support a community-driven development mechanism for social service delivery by the end
of the CAS period, if sufficient progress i s made in administrative deconcentration and decentralization.
2.b. Improved access of the poor to health and H I V / A I D S services

47.
The broad health-related objectives o f the CSLP are to reduce child and maternal mortality,
improve child nutrition, and reduce HIV prevalence. The CAS will support national efforts to increase
use and quality o f primary health services through system-wide reforms and greater emphasis on
vaccination coverage, prenatal care, assisted births, and contraceptive use. Bank assistance will also aim
to enhance the coverage and effectiveness o f HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment programs, in
order to reduce high-risk behavior, and improve access to ARV treatment for A I D S patients. Since
malaria i s the major source o f child mortality and adult morbidity in Burkina, Bank support will aim at
scaling up malaria prevention and treatment programs, including significantly expanding coverage o f
treated bed-nets. Finally, the Bank will seek to strengthen multi-sectoral interventions to address
persistent child malnutrition.
48.
The PRSC series will continue to support health system reforms, including improved allocation of
financial and human resources, strengthened performance contracting and increased financial access
among the poor. WBI will focus o n enhancing local capacity for contracting human resources and
managing health facilities. IDA will also assist government in building capacity to undertake institutional
and policy reforms, as well as provide direct support for prevention and treatment o f malaria and

- 17-

HIV/AIDS and upgrading of basic health services through a Health and HIVIAIDS Sector-wide Support
Program (FY06). This SWAP will help IDA to consolidate instruments (in particular the two on-going
operations devoted to combating HIVlAIDS) while addressing more systematically the country’s burden
o f disease and weak health services capacity. With respect to HIV/AIDS, IDA will continue to support
enhanced behavior change campaigns, strengthened prevention programs for vulnerable groups, and
scaling up o f ARV treatment programs through public-private partnerships. WBI will strengthen the
country’s capacity t o manage procurement and logistics for HIV/AIDS drugs and supplies. To address
malnutrition, the Bank will work with the Burkinabt: authorities to overcome knowledge gaps that prevent
effective action. Analytic work will be carried out in FY06 on the Determinants o f Childhood
Malnutrition, with the aim o f integrating appropriate multi-sectoral measures (e.g. small-scale livestock
development for increased protein intake) into Burkina’s development strategy and IDA support. As with
education, decentralized health services could figure in a community-driven development mechanism
toward the end o f the CAS period if IDA resources are available and Burkina’s decentralization
performance warrants it.
2.c. Increased Access to Potable Water and Sanitation Sewices

49.
IDA will continue to support Burkina’s long-term strategy for development o f water supply and
sanitation, particularly in fast-growing urban and semi-urban areas where population pressure and
inadequate infrastructure are contributing to unhealthy living conditions. The Ouagadougou Water Supply
Project has contributed to multi-donor support to dramatically increase water resources in the capital city.
With large-scale c i v i l works completed, IDA funding will support the next phase o f activity: construction
o f secondary and tertiary networks aimed at doubling the number o f household connections and creating
hundreds o f communal standpipes in and around Ouagadougou. IDA will increasingly rely on the PRSC
to support policy measures and decentralized management o f investments in potable water and sanitation
in secondary urban areas and semi-urban areas, carrying forward the work begun under the Urban
Environment Credit (and Supplemental Credit), closing in December 2005. Efforts will continue to aim
developing adequate water production capacity in secondary centers covered by national water
at (i)
extending the water supply network; and (iii)
supporting social water connection programs
authority; (ii)
to facilitate access to the poor. Policy measures will focus on strengthening public-private partnerships for
urban water supply, enhancing governance in the sector and maintaining financial sustainability.
Increased attention will be given to a number o f secondary cities considered key to stimulating marketing
and ago-processing and offering social services to surrounding rural areas. A capacity building program
to support decentralized management in these secondary centers and to strengthen local private water
services providers will be prepared in FY06 to complement the PRSC-supported reform and rehabilitation
agenda.
2.d. A Better Targeted Social Protection Strategy

50.
Completion o f a comprehensive Social Protection Strategy was a measure supported by PRSC 5.
IDA provided both financial and technical resources for preparation, and will continue to support
implementation o f the strategy, particularly strengthening o f the policy and financing framework to better
target social protection. WBI will lend its support through i t s Social Risk Management program.
Government i s also completing a strategy to support Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVCs) in
partnership with UNICEF, IDA and other donors. Future PRSCs will support development and
implementation o f sequenced plans for care and affordable education for OVCs. IDA-funded HIV/AIDS
operations and the successor Health and HIV/AIDS Sector-wide Support Program will support OVCs
directly through village level interventions, support for NGO-led O V C activities, and a pilot program and
impact evaluation on alternative approaches (e.g. conditional cash transfer mechanisms) to communitybased OVC care.

-18-

Strategic Objective 3: Increased Employment and Income Opportunitiesfor the Poor

5 1.
Pillar Three of the CSLP takes a two-pronged approach to employment and income generation
issues, focusing o n labor market policy that tends to affect urban employment, and on sustainable rural
development to address income and employment among the vast majority o f the poor who reside in rural
areas. The Bank’s contribution will aim to support: a) enhanced labor market flexibility for j o b creation;
b) increased economic opportunities for women; c) reduced risks and increased revenues for rural
households; d) community-based land and natural resource management; and e) expanded access to rural
infrastructure.
3 . a Enhanced Labor Market Flexibility for Job Creation
52.
Government i s reviewing Burkina’s Employment Strategy with the aim o f creating a policy
environment more conducive to j o b creation. Recent IDA-funded analytic work on doing business in
Burkina was helpful in highlighting areas where Burkina’s policies remain less flexible than those o f
developed countries and fast-growing developing countries. IDA i s supporting preparation and
dissemination o f a Labor Market Study to provide an updated analytic foundation for revising the national
Employment Strategy. The study will make recommendations to improve the statistical foundation and
monitoring and evaluation o f employment and labor market policies. K e y labor market measures will be
an integral part o f future PRSC support for growth and private sector development. IDA will continue to
directly support j o b creation through operations such as PACDE (e.g. SME credit line) and PST2 (e.g.
private sector road maintenance).

3.b. Increased Economic Opportunitiesfor Women

53.
Raising female literacy rates will facilitate women’s advancement and understanding o f their
rights. Increasing women’s participation in community decision-making will begin to reduce gender
disparities in access to high-quality land, modern inputs, appropriate technology and other incomegenerating assets and opportunities. An IDA-funded Gender Assessment in 2004 has influenced IDA’S
contribution in this area. The Community-based Rural Development Project supports empowerment o f
gender-balanced village committees to define and implement local development projects, as well as
literacy programs targeted to rural women. In coming years, the project will help to increase women’s
awareness o f their rights and improve their access to land -- an area subject to customary law. PAFASP
will specifically support organization o f women’s associations for production, marketing and agroprocessing, as well as access to technology geared to women’s income-generating activities. Past
experience suggests that women will play a leadership role in crop diversification and small-scale agroprocessing if they have equal access to factors o f production and markets.
3.c. Reduced Risk and Increased Revenuesfor Rural Households
54.
Agricultural production, including crops and livestock, remains the dominant source o f revenue
for rural households. Investment and income potential are undermined by various risks, including
insecurity o f land tenure, regional infestations, animal disease outbreaks, periodic drought, unpredictable
water supplies and volatility in the world cotton market. Intensification and diversification are also
constrained by underdeveloped marketing and agro-processing channels. IDA i s supporting risk
reduction through several instruments. Last year, the country joined i t s neighbors in the IDA-funded
African Program to Combat Locust Infestation, aimed at developing regional surveillance and rapid
response capabilities. InBurkina, pilot activities o n securing land tenure and improving land productivity
are underway with support from the Community-based Rural Development Project (CBRD), which has
also helped hundreds o f villages increase agricultural productivity through dissemination o f traditional

-19-

and modem soil conservation techniques. At the request o f communities, CBRD will now begin
expanding i t s support to implement a broader range o f income-generating projects.

55.
Through PAFASP, IDA will continue to support demand-driven development o f small-scale
irrigation -- an area where farmers’ organizations have substantially increased income from dry-season
cultivation o f crops such as vegetables. I t will also promote private investment in agricultural supply
chains and adapted agro-processing technology as well as support implementation o f recommendations
made in the study Livestock, Poverty and Growth in order to reduce vulnerability o f rural households.”
Support for private sector-led diversification will be coupled with continued support to improve cotton
sector productivity and competitiveness. WBI will contribute to IDA’S action through several of i t s
programs that link rural development policies to poverty reduction; help reform institutions in the context
o f new land policies; and improve food quality and supply chains. T o ensure the sustainability o f these
interventions, WBI i s strengthening the ability o f local training institutes to support the government’s vast
rural development agenda, through a twinning arrangement with the training center o f the two largest
technical schools in the rural sector.
3.d. Community-based Land and Natural Resource Management

56.
Conserving Burkina’s biodiversity and forest cover, and strengthening sustainable land
management, are priorities to alleviate environmental degradation, promote renewable energy and
develop a nascent eco-tourism industry. Government subscribes to the Sustainable Land Management
(SLM) approach embraced by NEPAD to meet the changing needs o f apculture, forestry and
conservation, while ensuring long-term productivity and ecological functioning o f ecosystems and their
services. IDA has supported efforts to empower communities to manage scarce resources in collaboration
with private sector entrepreneurs. A GEF-funded Partnership for Natural Ecosystem Management
(PAGEN) provides support to rural communities that have demonstrated willingness to engage in largescale conservation efforts. The program aims to strengthen management and revenue-generating capacity
within a three-way partnership o f the forest and wildlife administration, local communities and private
sector tourism operators. In support o f the National Plan to Combat Desertification, the GEF-financed
Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem Management (SILEM) program works within the CBRD framework
to strengthen rural communities capacity to assess, plan and manage land and other natural resources and
participate in development decision-making with other partners.
3.e. Expanded Access to Rural Infrastructure

57.

Raising rural incomes requires physical access to markets and affordable energy for incomegenerating activities -- both o f which have tangible health and education benefits for rural communities as
well. The national Transport Sector Program (PST2) aims to expand rural access to all-season roads and
lower transport costs. IDA’Ssupport to PST2 includes construction o f 2,830 kilometers o f rural feeder
roads linking agricultural communities to markets and services. Through capacity building and
investment support, IDA will also strengthen management and upgrade infrastructure in secondary cities
that act as regional centers for rural marketing and social services. PAFASP will also support storage and
post-harvest infrastructure in rural and secondary urban areas. The on-going Power Sector Development
Project will invest in rural electrification along the Bobo-Ouaga transmission line. However, electricity i s
not an economical option for much o f rural Burkina. A complementary Energy Access Program will be
supported by IDA and GEF to facilitate participation o f communities, NGOs, and the private sector to
meet energy demands at the levels o f households, schools, health clinics, community facilities and small
and medium enterprises. I t will promote renewable energy technologies, and remove market barriers to
scaling them up.

Strategic Objective 4: Better Governance with Greater Decentralization

58.
The CSLP recognizes that governance affects the achievement o f development outcomes across
all strategic pillars and sectors. W h i l e introducing governance issues across the spectrum, the CSLP
retains a separate pillar on Promoting Good Governance in order to heighten the visibility o f reforms
related to fairness, transparency, accountability and participation in public life. The Bank will also
incorporate governance issues broadly throughout i t s sectoral support. Particular emphasis will be placed
on the CAS contribution to three intermediate outcomes: a) a more efficient judiciary for commercial
cases; b) improved public resource management in a decentralized context; and c) increased local
capacity and participation in public policy decisions.

4.a A More Efficient Judiciary for Commercial Cases
59.
External partners share government’s view that a well-functioning judicial system i s crucial to
improving governance, combating corruption, and consolidating the democratic order. Several o f them
are supporting broad reforms o f the judicial system. IDA will contribute by focusing on strengthening
judicial processes and commercial chambers for rapid resolution o f business cases. The on-going
Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (PACDE) will provide for training o f magistrates,
development o f procedural manuals and publication o f decisions, as well as continuing to support
harmonization o f business law within the O H A D A framework and strengthening the arbitration process in
Burhna. Key measures to strengthen judicial processes in this area will be supported under PRSCs 6
through 9. In support o f IDA’Saction, WBI will continue to assist the key national stakeholders in
identifying and addressing the factors that affect performance o f the judiciary based on the experience o f
countries that have faced, or are still facing, situations similar t o Burkina Faso’s. W B I ’ s support will also
be extended to the legislative branch where the dual focus will be o n strengthening the capacity o f
parliament in exercising its budgetary oversight responsibility and training o f parliamentary staff.
4.b. Improved Public Resource Management in a Decentralized Context

60.
Adoption o f the L a w on Local Administration in late 2004 paves the way for further
deconcentration and decentralization o f public responsibilities and resources. The PRSC series has
supported considerable progress in public resource management, and will continue to do so within the
FY06-09 CAS. Priorities will include further deconcentration o f budget processes and development o f
sectoral program budgets and medium-termexpenditure frameworks; strengthened budget execution and
oversight, deconcentration o f human resource management, especially in the health and education sectors;
clearly defined responsibilities and resource transfers for decentralized levels o f government; increased
transparency o f public procurement and enforcement o f sanctions; and strengthened state inspection
agencies. Recommendations o f the participatory Public Expenditure Review and joint Country
Procurement Assessment Report are being incorporated in Government’s Plan for Strengthening Budget
Management (PRGB) and will be reflected in future PRSCs. Analytic work o n public expenditures,
financial management and procurement will be updated in FY07 and FY08. An important complement to
the PRSC series will be the recently approved Public Administration Capacity Building Project (PRCA).
I t was designed to fill gaps in support for central ministries’ plans to carry out cross-cutting reforms o f
public finance and administration. Limited progress in cross-cutting areas such as civil service reform has
undermined Burkina’s ability to deepen economic reforms, decentralize public service delivery and
increase transparency throughout the system. T o strengthen capacity to decentralize public service
delivery, WBI will offer a program for regional governors to better understand the role they can play in
carrying out decentralization policy.

-21 -

4.c. Increased Local Capacity and Participation in Public Policy Decisions

61.
Revision o f the CSLP benefited from increased civil society participation, including development
o f regional CSLPs as an input to the national level strategy. I t also benefited from a more results-oriented
approach to articulating objectives and defining a monitoring system. Access to reliable information and
increased flexibility to adapt strategies will be essential for all actors -- Government officials, private
sector and local communities -- in order to achieve better development results. The CAS will support
increased knowledge and the strengthening o f local capacity to manage for results. The Communitybased Rural Development Project (FY03) and i t s second phase (FY07) will continue to support
government ’s Programme National de Gestion des Terroirs (PNGT2). This community-driven approach
has been a primary instrument for building village-level management capacity, and will be expanded as
rural communes are established and decentralization gathers steam. WBI will complement IDA’s efforts
by promoting stakeholders’ participation in the policy dialogue. In particular, WBI will contribute to
development o f an enabling environment for the media and for free exchange o f information, as well as
supporting activities aimed at community empowerment.
62.
Burkina Faso i s also a pilot country for the Bank’s StatCap Program (PDSSN), linked closely to
monitoring and evaluation o f the CSLP. The program will aim to enhance the reliability o f core statistics
and increase capacity to use and interpret statistics for evidence-based decision-making at the policy,
program and community levels. The IDA-funded Global Distance Learning Center o f Ouagadougou
(CEDO) will begin operations in 2005, offering greater access to the global learning network. Burkina i s
also a focus country for the World Bank Institute, which will rely on CEDO for workshops and courses,
as well as offer new products geared to capacity enhancement, facilitated country dialogue and improved
access to regional and global experience. WBI activities will be linked to other elements o f the country
program, and will focus on governance issues (PRSP monitoring, Parliamentary oversight, judicial
reform, and combating corruption) and community-based development (land tenure, basic social
services).

D. I D A Instruments
1. Analytic Work
63.
IDA’s support for participatory analytic work in FYO1-05 has enriched strategy development and
policy debate within Burkina, as well as providing a strong foundation for the upcoming CAS. An IDAsupported week-long Poverty and Public Expenditure Forum in 2004 provided an opportunity for
government, civil society and external partners to move from a broad discussion o f poverty trends and
characteristics (supported by the Poverty Assessment) to a review o f the linkages between national
strategy and public expenditures (supported by the Public Expenditure Review) and then, more narrowly,
to the contribution o f the World Bank (supported by a results-oriented Country Portfolio Review). This
luck-off event for preparation o f the CAS was deemed so useful by participants that it i s likely to become
a bi-annual feature o f the Bank-Burkina partnership. IDA will continue to support preparation and
dissemination o f participatory analytic work in the FY06-09 period linked to strategic priorities.” Areas
o f particular emphasis in the next few years will include private sector development (Investment Climate
Assessment, Financial Sector Review, Integrated Trade Framework and Labor Market Study), sequencing
o f decentralization, and understanding and addressing persistent malnutrition.

l2

See Annex B4 for a summary o f planned analytic work.

- 22 -

2. Financial Products
64.
Simplification of instruments, harmonization with partners and support for country systems will
be explicit IDA goals during this CAS period. Support will be channeled to three levels relying on three
types of instruments. Development policy loans will continue to support implementation o f the CSLP
through the national budget. Sector interventions -- increasingly through pooled sector-wide approaches
(SWAPS) -- will support institutional development and efficient service delivery in priority sectors.
Community-based approaches will be the instrument o f choice to support decentralized development.
65.
Continued development policy lending. Self- and independent evaluations o f the first PRSC
series in Burkina concluded that increased reliance on development policy lending has effectively
supported implementation o f the CSLP while improving predictability o f aid flows and encouraging
harmonization and alignment among external partner^.'^ Support through the PRSC instrument rose from
about a quarter o f IDA commitments in FY02-03 to more than half in FY04-05. As Burkina implements
i t s second-generation CSLP, IDA can do more to ensure that the next PRSC series i s increasingly resultsfocused, better harmonized with other budget support and strengthens national capacity to monitor and
evaluate progress. The PRSC series will be accompanied by capacity-building operations to support
reform o f public administration and strengthening o f country systems.
66.
Greater movement toward sector-wide approaches. Increased flexibility o f Bank policies will
facilitate a more pronounced movement toward sector-wide approaches built around medium-term
expenditure frameworks, pooled donor funding, harmonized procedures, and home-grown monitoring and
evaluation systems. Currently, Burkina’s implementation capacity in key sectors i s sorely taxed by
donors’ continued reliance on a fi-agmented project approach and diverse procedures -- even where the
country has established a sector-wide strategy and medium-term expenditure framework. Progress toward
pooled SWAPS with harmonized procedures will be made in education, transport, health and HIV/AIDs.
On-going interventions in water supply and power generation support sector-wide strategies in
partnership with other donors, but are efficiently coordinated as stand-alone projects for large-scale
infrastructure investments.
67.
Expanded community-driven development. Government’s PNGT2 has been notably successful
in strengthening village-level capacity to carry out projects -- such as building schools and anti-erosion
barriers -- more efficiently than through traditional Governmenb‘donor mechanisms. IDA will continue to
support government’s model for community-driven development through the first and second phases o f
the Community-based Rural Development Project. In so doing, IDA will j o i n with other external partners
in evaluating experience to date and helping government to refine a model around which donor funds can
be aligned. IDA will also support expansion o f a community-driven approach for decentralized delivery
o f social and municipal services, either within the scope o f the existing CBRD or a complementary
instrument.

E. Development Partners
68.
Aid flows equivalent to 12 to 14 percent o f Burkina Faso’s GDP put a premium on partnership
among development agencies, and require leadership by government to coordinate partner^'^, work with
domestic stakeholders, align priorities and harmonize procedures around country strategies and systems.
Burkina has long been fertile ground for implementing CDF principles: long-term strategic vision,

country ownership, partnerships and focus on re~u1ts.l~For the revised CSLP, government put in place
sectoral and thematic groups to encourage a broad partnership for implementation and monitoring -although efficient functioning o f this mechanism remains a challenge.

1. IDA ’s Partnership with Development Agencies
69.
IDA and the other branches of the World Bank Group collaborate with a range o f development
agencies active in BurkinaI6. This has been facilitated by increased decentralization o f strategic planning
and task leadership to the Bank’s Country Office in Ouagadougou. W e l l before the adoption o f a full
CSLP in 2000, Burkina’s partners began moving beyond “projectized” aid, toward a programmatic
approach aligned with the country’s priorities and budget cycle. Progress on this front has been notable,
with the CSLP serving as a focal point for aligning support, including IDA’SPRSC series, four successive
programs under the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and budget support from the European
Union and various member states. Under EU leadership, a memorandum o f understanding (MOU) was
signed in 2002 among the EU and five bilateral donors for the harmonization o f budget support. IDA
worked very closely with this group and with the IMF to coordinate preparation o f the initial PRSC series
to better align with the budget cycle. IDA works within i t s UN family as well, collaborating specifically
o n economic management, rural development and delivery o f social services. In the coming year, the
African Development Bank will be opening a local office in Ouagadougou that will strengthen the ongoing partnership with IDA in areas such as transport and combating HIV/AIDS, as well as allow the
AfDB to better harmonize with other partners at the national and sectoral levels.

70.
In January 2005, government and i t s partners -- including the World Bank and the African
Development Bank -- signed a path-breaking MOU that creates a common framework for assessing
budget support based on macroeconomic performance, public sector resource management and
implementation o f the CSLP. Further efforts will focus o n strengthening national monitoring and
evaluation systems, improving alignment with the budget cycle and streamlining donor missions. At the
sectoral level, IDA task teams work closely and productively with partners, participating injoint missions
and reviews in areas such as transport, education and community-based development. However,
partnership must progress toward more concrete actions to harmonize procedures and reporting
requirements around country systems. High-level commitment to this goal among development agencies
has not always been matched by increased institutional flexibility to do so. IDA has taken some
important strides in this direction -- much appreciated by the Burkinabk -- but task teams need to
internalize and take advantage o f this flexibility in working with other partners. In the coming year, IDA
will j o i n with several other partners to establish a multi-agency harmonization team in Burkina aimed at
identifying and overcoming donor obstacles to harmonized action.
2. IDA’S Partnership with the Private Sector and Civil Society

7 1.
Academics, non-governmental organizations, private entrepreneurs and communities have had
successful public-private partnerships with IDA and with government under IDA-fundedactivities. Some
notable examples include working through non-governmental organizations for community-based
prevention and treatment o f HIV/AIDS; promoting small-scale irrigation through private farmers’
associations; enlisting traditional chiefs to communicate public health messages; piloting private
contracting to expand secondary education, empowering village committees to carry out development
projects; contracting with small and medium-enterprises for road maintenance; engaging private
entrepreneurs in workshops to define investment climate reforms and hiring local academics to
independently evaluate PRSC support. Public-private partnerships -- in all forms -- will continue under

the FY06-09 CAS. New operations will build on successful approaches; for example, PAFASP will
support agricultural diversification through private-sector led initiatives that have proved effective in
previous agricultural operations.

F. I D A Financing Scenarios

72.
Strong performance in macroeconomic management and implementation o f structural measures
within the CSLP framework, coupled with largely satisfactory implementation o f the IDA portfolio (albeit
w i t h a need to accelerate disbursements) have given Burkina Faso access to significant IDA resources in
the FY01-05 period. Commitments averaged US$138 million per annum against an initial country
allocation o f around US$123 million per annum. l7Forty-seven percent o f this was in the form o f grants
in the FY03-05 period.
73.
Indicative I D A Resources for FY06-09. The risk o f reduced country commitment or significant
shifts in policy orientation during the CAS period i s regarded as low. If the country continues to make
progress in macroeconomic management, public resource management and implementation o f the revised
CSLP, strong and predictable support from IDA i s warranted. The base case scenario proposes an
indicative envelope for IDA commitments o f U S 1 4 0 million per annum during FY06-09 (equivalent to
an IDA allocation o f SDR 94 million for FY06). This scenario would support projected real growth o f
4.8 percent per annum, based on modest growth o f cotton exports, moderate growth o f non-cotton exports
and sustained levels o f aid inflows. Actual allocations will depend on Burkma's own policy and portfolio
performance, i t s performance relative to other IDA recipients, and the amount o f overall resources
available IDA. It will also depend on the terms o f the financial assistance provided. Based o n i t s current
debt vulnerability and CPIA rating, Burkina i s considered ineligible for IDA grants in FY06. However, if
found to be moderately debt-distressed in future years, Burkina would be eligible to receive half o f its
performance-based allocation on grant term with a 20 percent volume discount to this grant allocation."

Improving the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). Higher amounts o f IDA
resources would reflect improvement in Burkina’s policy environment relative. The composite CPIA
indicator i s used to assess policy performance and plays a major role in determining the volume o f yearly
IDA flows. Countries are evaluated annually according to 16 criteria grouped into the broad categories
of: i)macroeconomic management; ii)structural policies; iii)policies for social inclusion and equity; and
iv) public sector management and institutions - along with portfolio performance and governance factor
which i s derived from the five criteria in the last cluster; and (v) the CPIA plus procurement flag in the
ARPP.20 Burkina’s CPIA rating has risen steadily in this decade and i s now among the highest quintile o f
IDA recipients. Within this relatively positive rating, considerable scope exists to strengthen some areas,
as indicated in Table 3.2. Significant improvement in weaker areas would raise Burkina’s CPIA and
favor access to higher volumes o f IDA resources. Improvement in these areas would demonstrate an
intensified commitment to reforms aimed at promoting economic diversification, regional integration and
decentralized service delivery, spurring increased private investment and faster growth o f non-traditional
exports. Coupled with increased aid flows for infrastructure, rural development and basic social services
-- including as much as 20 percent higher IDA commitments -- this could support real growth o f as much
as 6.0 percent per annum in the FY06-09 period. Government enters the CAS period with a proven
commitment to reform that i s consistent with a higher level o f international support -- including IDA -- if
additional resources are available.

Downside Risk. Failure to complete measures supported by the annual PRSC would trigger
75.
discussion o f reduced IDA financing. Thus, yearly IDA commitments would be flexibly defined around
the PRSCs and associated SWAps. In the complete absence o f PRSCs and SWAps, commitments would
be reduced to an around US$50-80 million per annum for a l o w case scenario focused on communitybased rural development and social service provision as well as road infrastructure and energy.

THE COUNTRY PROGRAM

A. Portfolio Management
76.
Burkina’s IDA portfolio consists o f 14 active operations with total net commitments o f US$528
million, o f which US$357 i s currently undisbursed. The nature and composition o f the portfolio evolved
during the last CAS period with the transition to a programmatic approach and the introduction o f
community-driven development mechanisms. During the FY06-09 period, further progress toward a
programmatic approach will be made, reducingthe number o f active country-based operations from 14 to
around 8 by the end o f the CAS period. Remaining operations will include capacity building to
complement the PRSCs (e.g. PRCA, StatCap) sector-wide approaches for institutional development
(education, health), pilot operations and large-scale infrastructure projects (e.g. energy and water supply).
Burkma will also participate in four regional operations by the end o f the CAS period.
Portfolio performance.
In general, portfolio performance in the past CAS period was
77.
satisfactory, both for achievement o f development objectives and implementation progress. One recent
operation -- Development of the National Statistical System -- i s judged “at risk”. The Basic Education
Sector Program i s also suffering from implementation bottlenecks, and will be restructured as a
harmonized sector-wide approach during its mid-termreview in M a y 2005.

78.
Implementation bottlenecks. Slow implementation has been a problem in Burkina particularly
because o f effectiveness delays o f anywhere from six months to eighteen months due to complicated
judicial and legislative procedures, cumbersome national procurement procedures and weak
implementation capacity in ministries and other agencies. This has led to repetitive extensions o f closing
dates and inadequate disbursement ratios. Disbursement was particularly l o w in FY02 and FY03 (13-14
percent disbursement ratio), but has risen to 19-20 percent for FY04 and FY05.
79.
Accelerating effectiveness and disbursement. A v i s i t by LEGAF to Burkina in April 2005
launched a dialogue on streamlining procedures for effectiveness which i s expected to alleviate the
problem. Efforts are underway to reform national procurement procedures, but progress needs to be more
rapid and results-oriented. To this end, IDA and AfDB are jointly working with the Burkinabk to prepare
a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). The action plan arising from this work will be the
basis for reforms supported by PRSCs 6-9. Perhaps most helpful will be IDA’S efforts to apply new
policy flexibility (such as the Country Financing Parameters), use simplified instruments and adopt
harmonized approaches to reduce the transaction costs o f dealing with multiple development partners
with differing procedures and reporting requirements.
Strengthening the focus on results. A results-based Country Portfolio Performance Review
80.
(CPPR) carried out in November 2004 demonstrated the scope to better define expected results and link
them to the national CSLP, to develop monitoring and evaluation systems that go beyond financial and
physical outputs to assess development outcomes and to build national capacity to carry out results-based
monitoring and evaluation at the national, sectoral and decentralized levels. Newer operations were far
more likely to have a results-based monitoring and evaluation system, trained staff and appropriate
baseline data -- although they s t i l l tend to focus more on outputs than on the outcomes upon which the
activity must ultimately be judged.

B. Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation of the CAS

81.
The monitoring and evaluation framework for the CAS reflects that o f the CSLP with which it i s
aligned. Monitoring and evaluation o f the CSLP i s overseen by an inter-ministerial Steering Committee
assisted by sectoral and thematic groups composed o f government technicians, external partners and

- 28 -

representatives o f c i v i l society. A results-based approach was introduced in formulating the Priority
Action Plan (PAP), which led to more outcome-oriented articulation o f country priorities and to a clearer
set o f indicators for monitoring progress and evaluating outcomes. Notably, the PAP succeeded in
identifying 24 core indicators -- including a number o f country-specific MDG indicators -- among a more
comprehensive set o f sectoral indicators. The core indicators derive from existing national and sectoral
statistical systems and were chosen on the basis o f their relevance as well as the relative reliability of
data. The Government has made efforts to improve the frequency and reliability o f data with support
from external partners, including establishing a Poverty Observatory, and carrying out periodic poverty
assessments and surveys such as the 2003 Demographic and Health Survey. While progress has been
made in defining the CSLP monitoring and evaluation framework, much more work i s needed to
strengthen Government and civil society monitoring capacity, and to align sectoral systems to contribute
systematically to overall CSLP monitoring.

CAS results framework.
With the CSLP as a foundation, CAS preparation began with
82.
development o f a results framework linking the IDA program to country priorities. The results-based
approach stimulated greater cross-sectoral discussion on expected outcomes and effective strategies. The
results framework identifies outcomes to which the CAS can contribute, as well as measurable indicators
for evaluating these outcomes upon completion. It also identifies mid-term progress indicators that focus
on key policy measures and actions needed to achieve results. Figure 3 summarizes the core CAS
indicators identified in the results framework (Annex 1). Three-fourths o f the core indicators are directly
from the PAP. Several others are from sectoral monitoring systems supported by IDA, or are components
o f composite CSLP indicators, deemed more relevant to monitor the IDA-fundedprogram. They include
9 o f the 14 outcome indicators monitored across countries within the 14 IDA results measurement
system.’l The core indicators and the supporting results framework will help IDA assess progress and
modify strategy as necessary at mid-term and completion to remain a relevant and effective development
partner.
83.
Simplijication and harmonization. Progress on simplification o f instruments and harmonization
o f procedures and reporting around country systems i s an explicit goal o f the FY06-09 CAS. Progress
will be assessed on the basis o f i)the share o f IDA commitments in pooled funding arrangements
(including budget support); ii)the share of on-going IDA operations using regular joint donor supervision
missions/reviews, iii)the share o f IDA tasks (operations and ESW) led from the field; and iv) the share o f
IDA operations relying on unified reporting systems. These performance indicators will be used to assess
progress at mid-term and upon completion o f the CAS.
Strengthening country systems. The results-based CPPR showed progress among newer
84.
operations in defining a monitoring and evaluation framework at an early stage, and in strengthening
national and sectoral systems, rather than establishing parallel, project-specific systems. Notable
examples included the Transport Sector Program, HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Program and the
Community-base Rural Development Project, which provided useful lessons for decentralized monitoring
systems. More progress should be made during the CAS period to use IDA-funded operations to support
national and sector systems, and in helping these systems extend beyond monitoring o f inputs and
physical outputs to track outcomes that affect Burkinab2. well-being. Movement toward harmonized
sector-wide and community-base approaches should drive this progress, as will specific interventions to
build statistical and results-based monitoring and evaluation capacity.

*’

The remaining 5 outcome indicators o f the IDA results measurement system were not included due to
measurement constraints (HIV/AIDS prevalence, public expenditure management, and telecommunications) or
a preference for more country-specific indicators (gender balance in basic education, electrification rate).

C. Managing Risks

85.
In the next four years, Burkina Faso faces risks in achieving development objectives and
implementing the IDA program, some o f which cannot be easily mitigated through government
intervention. Among these, the evolution of world market prices for cotton and the dollar exchange
rate are perhaps the most intractable and most damaging to future growth prospects. A permanent
adjustment o f the cotton sector to lower real prices may be necessary. Strategy in the cotton sector
already aims to reduce this risk, by focusing on increased productivity and competitiveness with greater
private sector involvement. Faster and deeper reform may prove necessary, coupled with redoubled
efforts to diversify agricultural and other exports. In the meantime, government will continue to play a
leading role among cotton-producing countries in advocating reduced subsidies and better market access
in the developed world. IDA will provide predictable but flexible support through PRSCs to support
Burkina’s cotton sector measures.

86.
Continued sub-regional political instability also threatens to increase transport costs, tamish the
investment climate and hinder efforts for economic integration. Burkina has mitigated negative impacts
through diversification o f i t s transport routes in recent years, and has made a commitment to improving
the domestic investment climate even in a less-than-optimal sub-regional environment. In the past few
years, Burkina has developed a more visible presence in sub-regional and regional institutions, including
the African Union and NEPAD, as well as raising i t s profile as a reliable partner in the global arena.
87.
Internally, development progress could be hampered by inadequate progress on administrative
deconcentration and political decentralization. Adoption o f a clear legal framework was slow and
fraught with controversy. N o w that the legal framework i s in place, government has taken measures to
improve the prospects for moving forward, particularly by reaching out to local program coordinators
throughout the country to build support. External partners consider this a priority for improved aid
effectiveness, and IDA will support a well-sequenced process through analytic work, PRSCs and related
capacity-building operations.
88.
As IDA increasingly adopts a programmatic approach in Burkina, the greatest risk to CAS
implementation remains the fiduciary risk o f insufficient transparency and accountability in public
resource management and public procurement. Mitigation has involved making budget and
expenditure management the sine qua non o f PRSC support, and backing it up with analytic work that
helps the authorities implement their budget management plan and deepen public procurement reform,
which has been timid in the past. Government will continue to expand use o f program budgets linked to
medium-term expenditure frameworks, as well as deconcentration o f payment authorization and
expenditure tracking systems.

Annex 2: Summary o f CAS Consultations
March 2005
Introduction

The draft Country Assistance Strategy was presented and discussed in various fora during March
2005. The objective was to increase public awareness o f the strategy document and to solicit
feedback on the likely relevance and effectiveness o f the proposed country program. A muchappreciated and enriching innovation o f this consultation process was to meet with traditional chief
and religious leaders, who remain very influential within Burkinabk society, and to create teams o f
local staff to carry out village-level consultations in three geographically and linguistically distinct
zones o f Burkina Faso.

CAS i s well-aligned with Burkina’s CSLP and with the needs o f the Burkinabk people as
perceived by these focus groups.
The Bank’s effort to consult i s appreciated, but i s too rare, particularly at decentralized levels.
External outreach must be intensified.
Areas where the Bank strategy i s perceived to be most relevant:
+:e
Supporting water management for small-scale irrigation.
+
e:
Increasing access to potable water.
.e:
Combating malaria in addition to HIV/AIDS.
44 Promoting income-generating activities for women through access to credit and
appropriate technology (particularly for agricultural processing).
+
e:
Developing affordable energy options for rural areas.
In terms o f instruments, those consulted expressed the views that:
e:*
Community-driven development i s an excellent tool to support Burkina’s decentralization,
but needs to be better-funded and expanded to support income-generating activities.
4 4 Sector-wide approaches are better than projects, but stakeholders are frustrated by the
inability o f extemal partners to harmonize procedures and engage in collective action.
Budget support i s not appreciated by local populations, who cannot identify the benefits. The
risk o f poor governance o f budgetary resources i s o f concem and will require careful
monitoring.

Main comments from consultations with government Ministers

CAS found to be well-aligned with PRSP by Ministry responsible for PRSP coordination and
monitoring. Results framework facilitates deep alignment.
Emphasis on economic diversification, well-functioning input and output markets and
agricultural transformation are appropriate and essential.
Rural roads are essential for diversification and poverty reduction. A credit line to support
small and medium enterprises carrying out road maintenance for Government would be helpful
for both the road network and the development o f the private sector.
Development o f secondary cities to strengthen rural-urban linkages i s a high priority. T o
maximize IDA resources available and strengthen decentralized country systems, Government
would prefer to see this agenda implemented through budget support via the PRSC 6-9 series.
Although natural resource management i s discussed, desertification i s not sufficiently taken
into account in IDA’Sstrategy to support agriculture.
Preparation o f the new Programme d ’Appui aux Filizres Agro-Sylvo-Pastorales should cross
ministerial boundaries to support the most promising agricultural sub-sectors-such as milk,
egg and chicken production highlighted by the Ministry o f Animal Husbandry-as well as
address cross-cutting issues like women’s access to productive resources.
Main comments from consultation with Parliamentarians
0
0

First meetingwith Bank. Parliamentarians would like to encourage on-going consultation.
Opposition members object to a PRSP that i s adopted by Govemment, but not ratified by
Parliament.
Opposition members reject the effectiveness o f aid and Burkina’s current level o f aid
dependence. Aid should disappear.
World Bank should work to help Burkina with cancellation o f i t s foreign debt.
Solar energy, higher education and scientific research merit more consideration.

Locusts and the price o f cotton are both serious problems-what i s the Bank doing about
them?
The Bank should support Parliamentarians, as leaders o f their parties, rather than supporting
fi-inge organizations that call themselves “civil society”. Parliamentarians do not define
themselves as leaders o f civil society, despite elected mandates.

Main comments f r o m civil societv, private sector, external partners, and Povernment
technicians (consultation workshop)

Plenav session:
0
Lack o f harmonization among external partners should be at the top o f the l i s t o f risks to
success, despite some progress in this area recently (e.g. budget support).
0
As the international community moves toward budget support and other programmatic
approaches, the risk o f poor governance becomes even greater. The Bank and other partners
need to redouble their efforts to support transparent systems.
0
Government needs to show greater leadership, and donors need to show greater flexibility, to
harmonize aid-funded activities around national strategies, institutions and systems.
0
The Bank should help civil society organizations to strengthen capacity.
0
For many, the Bank’s reputation i s o f an institution devoted to “failed structural adjustment o f
the 1980s”, forced privatizations and imposed conditionalities.
Workshops on strategic pillars:
Academics are concerned by a seemingly exclusive focus o f the international community o n
basic education, when the future requires high-quality advanced education, research and
technical training. Governments in rich countries fund this-why
doesn’t the donor
community do it here?
Decentralization, community participation and performance-based monitoring are top priorities
for improving access to, and quality of, social services.
Increasing the flexibility o f the labor market carries with it the risk o f increased exploitation
and abuse o f workers if governance i s not adequate to apply necessary legal protections.
The CSLP-and hence the CAS-focus particularly on rural poverty. However, the group
expressed particular concern for rapidly increasing poverty in peri-urban areas, especially
among women.
Expectations are high-perhaps unrealistically high-for the proposed progam for Agricultural
Intensification and Marketing (PAFASP) to address the biggest questions about the evolution
of cotton, diversification and the environment.
Harmonized sector-wide approaches and community-driven development are the instruments
of choice for decentralized development. The general public worries about the governance
risks associated with budget support unless transparent mechanisms for transfer o f resources to
local levels are operational.

M a i n comments f r o m consultation with traditional and religious leaders
0

“Usually they only call us when there i s a social conflict. This i s the first time the World Bank
has consulted us. They usually think we are only leaders o f opinion, but we are also leaders o f
action”.
Affordable energy i s essential for poverty reduction. Solar seems promising.
The focus on HIV/AIDS i s appreciated, but perhaps unbalanced relative to malaria, a more
prevalent problem.
The Bank strategy doesn’t talk about advanced education, but this i s important.

Many Muslim children study at arab-language universities outside the country. T h i s
essentially excludes them from the workforce in Burkina-which
i s a waste o f human
resources for the country.
Concerns center on (perceived) rising inequity and difficult access to capital and other
productive assets.
The Bank’s strategy i s for four years-but results often take longer. Can you really quantify
the impact o f this “results-based” strategy?
The Bank usually works with Government, but civil society and religious organizations are
often more effective. Can the Bank work more through us?

Main comments from village consultations in the Northern Zone
0

0

Villagers applaud the innovation o f consulting on the CAS at the local level.
In general, the strategy i s well-aligned with their priorities. In particular, they are concerned
about:
+
e:
Desertification in the arid Northern Zone and water management for humans and livestock.
e:*
Rural-urban linkage through the road network and telecommunications.
*:e
Access to credit and income-generating activities for women.
Locust infestation, associated food insecurity and social protection for the vulnerable.
e:*
Malaria i s the most prevalent health problem, HIV/AIDS less so.
*:e
Rising risks to security o f persons and property.

Annex 3: IFC and MIGA programs in Burkina Faso
International Finance Corporation

IFC currentporlfolio: IFC has not been very active in Burkina in terms o f investments (no new
investment in over four years). However, there have been a number o f business development
missions that look promising in recent months. IFC’s current investment portfolio totaling
US$617,000 consists of an equity investment in a bank (the local affiliate o f Ecobank) and a
guarantee to a trucking operator. I F C i s currently finalizing a potential $2.4 million investment in
the renovation o f the Hotel Independence.

FC’s strategy for Burkina Faso i s focused on: (i)improving the investment climate (ii)
building
up the capacity of SMEs and micro enterprises and o f institutions that can support them; and
(iii)
proactive support to project development in financial, tourism and mining sector.
SME development: Over the last two fiscal years, the Afkica Project Development Facility
(APDF) provided training to 44 SME staff, 55 consultants and 27 financial institution staff, and
supported one business association. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) also has an
on-going program to advise a ministry on competition policy, barriers to entry and
anticompetitive practices in four sectors (meauleather, h i t s and vegetables, cotton, and
commercial distribution). The competition policy report was submitted to the Burkinabe
Government in June 2004 and presented at a stakeholder seminar in Ouagadougou in November
2004.
Investment Climate: Improvements in the investment climate i s fundamental to private sector
development in Burkina Faso. The IDA Private Sector Development Credit i s providing support
for several areas such as support to the judicial reform in the domain o f commercial law.
Progress to date has been limited and the Government has solicited more assistance from the
World Bank. In response to the Government’s request, I F C intends to scale up i t s technical
assistance through FIAS and others unitdprograms that are already active in the country. IFC’s
Private Enterprise Partnership for Africa (PEP Africa), in collaboration with FIAS, i s proposing a
30-month program to improve the business climate in Burkina Faso focusing on the following
business registration and start-up, streamlining procedures to reduce time
five components: (i)
and costs; (ii)employment regulation to encourage formal employment while preserving
appropriate worker protections; (iii)
contract enforcement to improve the ability o f f i r m s to access
the judicial system or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for commercial matters;
(iv) property registration to simplify and reduce the costs o f acquiring and registering property
associated with private investment; and (v) business closing to improve liquidation and
bankruptcy procedures.

T o assist Burkina Faso to strengthen private sector development, IFC could complement the
carrying out i t s privatization program and utilities reforms with a particular
Bank’s support by: (i)
focus on the telecommunications and energy sectors; (ii)developing small and medium
enterprises through improved business environment, institution and capacity building (“Maison
providing a matching grant facility (US$5.5 million
de I’Entreprise du Burkina Faso”); and (iii)
grant) for enterprise access to consultants and training services in order to improve
competitiveness and to enhance micro-finance services in Burluna Faso.

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Apency

Burkina has been a member o f MIGA since 1988.

In FY05, MIGA issued guarantees totaling US$38.1 million to DAGRIS o f France for its
investments into Socibtb CotonniBre du Gourma (SOCOMA) in Burkina Faso. The project i s part
of the reorganization o f the cotton sector by the BurkinabC authorities. I t i s expected to modernize
and expand the cotton ginning capacity in order to meet the expected increase in cotton
production. I t will also contribute to the promotion o f local ownership, as DAGRIS will provide
financial support to the national cooperative o f cotton producers and three local private entities to
enable them to acquire 49 percent of the shares in SOCOMA. The project will not only retain all
workers formerly employed by SOFITEX in the region but will create an additional 130 jobs.
This project represents MIGA’s first exposure in the country.
MIGA strategy for Burkina Faso i s focused on: (i)
supporting efforts o f other World Bank Group
members, including the Bank, FIAS and PEP-Africa to improve the investment climate;
(ii)
supporting SME projects through guarantees; and (iii)
proactive guarantee support to larger
projects, especially in the agribusiness, manufacturing and services sector.
A MIGA representative visited Burkina Faso in October 2004 to identify potential areas for
support, and MIGA i s presently monitoring progress on the proposed PEP-Africa program, with
views to providing support in the dissemination o f information on improvements achieved so far
and using MIGA instruments to increase FDI flows into the country.

ANNEX 4: BURKINA FASO COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS
Date: January 2 1,2005
The country Financing parameters for Burkina Faso set out below have been approved by the
Regional Vice President, Africa, and are being posted on the Bank’s internal website.

ITEM

PARAMETER

REMARKS/EXPLANATION

A. Cost sharing
Limit o n proportion of
individual project cost that the
Bank may finance

u p to 100%

B. Recurrent costfinancing
Any limits that would apply
to the overall amount o f
recurrent expenditures that
the Bank may finance

N o countrylevel limit

Bank financing for individual projects may be up to
100 % o f project costs. This, would be determined
the availability o f the IDA financing envelope
by: (i)
the prioritization outlined in the revised
and, (ii)
PRSP and the new CAS. Full financing o f project
costs i s expected to be applied selectively, primarily
for operations supporting regional HIV/AIDS
programs and reform efforts. Cost sharing will likely
be the rule in projects with contributions from other
sources than Government, co-financing by other
donors, and projects with revenue generating and
SWAP mechanisms.
Given the country’s fragile financial situation, the
Bank will continue to monitor the aggregate fiscal and
debt situation, and i t s implications for recurrent cost
financing. Inall cases, recurrent cost financing will
be applied after consideration o f sector and project
institutional
sustainability issues including: (i)
arrangements to allow for greater emphasis o n
sustainability through result-based M&E systems, and
strengthening o f capacity at national and local level;
implied future budget outlays.
and (ii)
The criteria for Bank financing o f local costs are met.
Therefore, the Bank may finance local costs in any
proportions as needed for individual projects.

C. Local cost financing
Are the requirements for
Bank financing o f local
expenditures met, namely that
(i)
financing requirements for
the country’s development
program would exceed the
public sector’s own resources
(e.g., from taxation and other
revenues) and expected
domestic borrowing; and
(ii)
the financing o f foreign
expenditures alone would not
enable the Bank to assist in
the financing o f individual
projects
D. Taxes and duties
A r e there any taxes and duties
that the Bank would not
finance?

Yes

None

Currently, there are n o excessive taxes or duties in
Burkina Faso. At the project-level, the Bank would
consider whether taxes and duties constitute an
excessively high share o f project costs.

Annex 5: Burkina Faso’s Progress in Achieving Selected
MillenniumDevelopment Goals between 1990 and 2015
Goal I: Eradicate extremepoverty and hunger.
Halve the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day in purchasing power parity
terms. Economic growth and the impact o f public policies - particularly in rural areas - have
reduced the incidence of poverty by 8 percentage points over the period 1998-2003, for a
headcount indicator of 46 percent in 2003. The headcount for 1990 i s not available, but the 1994
figure can be used as a starting point since i t was also close to a measure o f $1 per day in PPP
terms. A consistently measured poverty headcount rate for 1994 would be around 60 percent, so
that the MDG target by 2015 would be approximately 30 percent. Based on the current trend in
poverty reduction, this MDG target would be met by 2015.
Halve the proportion of people who sufer from hunger. The latest Demographic and Health
Survey indicates that child malnutrition (underweight) has increased from 29 percent in 1993 to
38 percent in 2003, despite the decline in rural poverty. W h i l e malnutrition has multiple causes,
and improvements in nutrition indicators can lag growth improvements, further analysis i s
necessary to better understand trends and propose appropriate interventions to achieve the goal.

Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education and literacy
Ensure that all children-boys and girls-can complete a full course of primary schooling. The
gross primary enrollment rate stood at 30 percent in 1990 and 52 percent in 2004. The universal
education target in the MDGs will most likely not be reached by 2015, although great progress
has been recorded in terms o f school coverage. Even malung the optimistic assumption that the
national target o f 70 percent by 2010 would be met--that i s to say three percentage points increase
per annum from 2004 onwards, the gross enrollment rate would reach around 86 percent in 2015.
At this pace, universal primary enrollment could be achieved only by 2020, and primary
completion rates would lag behind.
Ensure that all adults are literate. Regarding the adult literacy rate (for ages 15-24), the country
i s making progress (18.4 percent in 1998 and 32 percent in 2003). If things continue at the
current pace (up 2.7 percentage points annually), the national target o f 40 percent by 2010 could
be reached, but the literacy rate would probably be about 60 percent in 2015, well below the
MDG o f universal literacy.

Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women
Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005 and in all
levels of education no later than 2015. The parity between boys and girls in primary education
by 2005 will not be achieved. The girl-boy ratio has moved from 0.62 in 1990 to 0.76 in 2003. At
the current pace, it would take another nine years (or until 2012) to achieve the target o f gender
equality in primary education.

Goal 4: Reduce child mortality
Reduce by two-thirds the under-Jive mortality rate. Infant and under-five mortality rates
decreased during the 1998-2003 period. T h i s i s a particularly important trend reversal for infant

- 70 -

and under-five mortality rates, which had risen between 1993 and 1998. In 2003, infant mortality
rate reached 83, and under-five mortality rate 184 deaths per 1,000 live births-an improvement
on 1998 figures, but not significantly better than in the early 1990s. This may be due to limited
progress in combating malaria (the major killer o f children), including l o w coverage o f
insecticide treated bednets, and chronic child malnutrition. Despite recent improvement, infant
and child mortality rates remain among the highest in the world--higher than the average for lowincome countries. If current positive trends continue, they would not be sufficient to meet
theMDG targets by 2015.
Goal 5: Improve maternal health
Reduce maternal mortality by three quarters. Maternal mortality rate i s down from 566 deaths
per 100,000 live births in 1993 to 484 in 1998. I f this trend continues at i t s current pace, the rate
will be 283 in 2015, well below the MDG set for Burkina, which i s 142 deaths per 100,000 live

births.

Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel. Only 35 percent o f births were assisted
by trained medical personnel in 2003. Further reductions in maternal mortality will require
strengthening the quality and coverage o f maternal care services at all levels (community, clinic,
and hospital), as well as improving geographic and financial accessibility to maternal care
services.
Goal 6: Combat HIVIAIDS, malaria and other diseases
Halt by 2015 and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS. Although Burkina has one o f the
highest prevalence H N rates in West Africa, HIV/AIDS prevalence among young women (1524) has declined in the past three years in urban sentinel surveillance sites (from 3.6% in 2001 to
1.9% in 2003), the result o f both increased mortality as well as improved behaviors (e.g.,
increased use o f condoms during high-risk sexual encounters). Sustaining these positive trends in
behavior change i s essential, even as treatment with anti-retroviral drugs i s rapidly scaled up.

Summary o f Report
1.
This CAS Completion Report (CASCR) aims to assess the effectiveness o f the World Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy for Burkina Faso (CAS) covering the FY00-03 period. The CAS was
designed to support the implementation o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approved in
2000. A Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) was prepared in April 8,2003. It outlined
an extension o f the Bank’s CAS to cover the period until the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
was updated (adopted by the Council o f Ministers o n October 27,2004). The CASPR also confirmed that
the Bank’s support to Burkina Faso would continue through a selection o f lending instruments including
PRSC, Community Driven Development operations (CDD), and other traditional infrastructure
investment operations. This report therefore will cover the period FYO1- first half o f FY05. I t s findings
will contribute to the new CAS in preparation. The next CAS will follow closely the “second generation”
PRSP.
2.
The progress achieved on implementing the CAS has been satisfactory. The poverty headcount
declined by about 8 percentage points between 1998 and 2003. Burkina Faso has satisfactorily
implemented four PRSCs and four PRGF-supported programs associated with the conduct o f sound
macroeconomic policies and significant structural reforms. T h e real GDP growth rate increased to more
than 5 percent on average during 2003-2004 from 4.7 percent during 1996-2002. The performance was
achieved despite three drought years in 1998, 2000 and 2002, and terms o f trades shocks in 2000, 2002
and 2004. Inflation has remained low. Fiscal policy improved generally, with the overall fiscal deficit
contained. Major structural reforms have been carried out, including in the areas o f price, trade
liberalization, public finance management and governance.
3.
The CASCR concludes that the Bank’s country strategy reflected a good understanding o f the
national challenges, and was relevant to and aligned with the Government’s long-term development goals
as spelled out in the PRSP. The performance o f the Government and the Bank during the CAS
implementation i s considered satisfactory, and the delivery o f the AAA and the portfolio performance
good. The Bank assisted the country in implementing key reforms in the cotton, water, transport, public
finance management sectors through its programmatic lending, ongoing projects and key analytical work.
Significant progress towards achieving the CAS outcomes has been made while more sustained efforts are
needed in order to attain the MDG goals and to give better access to social services, especially in the
education sector where, despite significant progress, illiteracy rates are among the highest in the World.
Diversifyingthe economy, improving investment climate, regional integration, social expenses efficiency
and donor coordination, accelerating decentralization and deconcentration, and strengthening national
capacity to execute, monitor and evaluate the revised PRSP are key challenges ahead in order to further
stimulate growth, improve the social well-being o f the population, and ensure an environment conducive
for sustainability.

I.

The Burkinab&Context and Longer-Term National Development Goals

4.
Burkina Faso's PRSP comprised four strategic pillars: (i)accelerating broad-based growth,
(ii)
promoting access to social services for the poor, (iii)
increasing employment and income-generating
activities for the poor (primarily in the rural sector); and (iv) promoting good governance.

5.
The country made good progress in implementing the PRSP", which has led to: (i)
a f i r s t series
o f three poverty reduction support credits (PRSC), the approval o f the fourth one and the preparation o f a
fifth one in the second series o f PRSC, and (ii)
the IMF support under the fourth successive program
supported by an arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The IMF
completed its first review in March 2004, second and third reviews under the program for 2003-2006 in
February 2005 with satisfactory outcomes.
6.
Burkina Faso reached the completion points under the original and enhanced H P C Initiatives in
June 2000 and April 2002 respectively, and was granted debt relief totaling more than US$550 million in
net-present value terms, including a topping-up at completion point.
Economic performance under the CAS

7.
Burkina Faso's economy i s characterized by its l o w per-capita income o f about $350 in 2004,
very limited human capital, high vulnerability to external shocks owing to i t s dependency o n cotton
production, strong dependence on external aid, and limited resource base. As a result, progress in
improving living conditions has been slow though steady, and Burkina Faso continues to rank very l o w
on the UnitedNations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development Index.
8.
Burkina Faso maintained a good macroeconomic framework and economic growth rates in 200 12004 with an average o f 6.2 percent. Growth was led by the agriculture sector, as exemplified by the
development o f cotton production and a record cereal production in 2003. Despite huge world price
fluctuations, there has been a strong and steady growth in the cotton sector, mainly attributed to good
management o f the sub-sector (including collaboration with producers' organizations and incentives
structure for farmers), and good progress on the reform agenda (privatization and opening to
competition). However, growth in agriculture could have been even better with more support to non
traditional supply chains and to diversification to enable the private sector to seize market opportunities in
sub-regional and international trade.
9.
The country made good progress on improving public finance management through on-going
efforts to increase transparency and accountability in policy implementation and budget management. I t
managed to mitigate the negative impact o f the C6te d'Ivoire crisis o n growth, employment and inflation
thanks to supportive Government policies: Government's subsidy to offset higher transport prices for
fertilizers, liberalization o f road transports and the revival o f traditional trade links with Ghana and Togo,
authorization to allow foreign trucks to pick up goods in Burkina Faso. Inflation remained subdued in the
CAS period, with an average o f 2 percent.

11.

Country Assistance Strategy Progress and Outcomes

10.
The four pillars o f the Bank's strategy were to support: (i)
accelerated growth strategy and closer
opportunities
integration into the regional economy; (ii)access o f the poor to basic social services, (iii)
for employment and income-generating activities for the poor; and (iv) good gov.emance and institutional
incorporating the results o f intensive
reforms. The approach outlined in the CAS consisted of: (i)

'

A s outlined in the 2001-2004 PRSP-PR and their Joint Staff Assessments, and the 2003 CAS Progress report.

- 75 -

analytical work and discussions with the Burkinabi. authorities on the causes o f poverty and the
focusing on the areas critical for the poor (education, health,
challenges o f higher sustainable growth; (ii)
addressing
water supply, rural development) and on increasing their access to basic public services; (iii)
key cross-cutting issues o f capacity building, gender, decentralization, and the environment; and
(iv)recommending a progressive shift from project support towards program support to further the
strategic, efficient, and equitable use o f public resources. Bank intervention in support o f the PRSP was
intended to be selective and complementary o f activities supported by other donors.

The CAS was based on a scenario o f moderate growth - average real GDP growth o f 4.5 percent
11.
per annum over the period o f 2000-2005, (leading to a decrease o f only 16 percent o f poverty - about 7
percentage points). In contrast, the PRSP projected real GDP growth rate o f over 7 percent a year in
2001-2003 (unprecedented and overly ambitious) due to the need for an ambitious reform agenda.
12.
T o assess i t s effectiveness, the CAS identified 14 key monitoring indicators (see Table 1 in the
Annex section) with no quantification defined but with specific monitoring instrument for each key
monitoring indicator. A few specific performance indicators were also spelled out in the CAS matrix (see
Table 2 in the Annex section). Only one had a baseline and target indicator (farm mechanization rate) but
the latter was for 2010. Also, indicators to go from one lending scenario to another were not defined
quantitatively but rather qualitatively. The CASPR did not fine-tune the indicators to incorporate
quantitative, outcome- and results-oriented benchmarks to better monitor the CAS outcomes but instead
reported on key Govemment’s PRSP and economic indicators.
Supporting the accelerated growth strategy and closer integration into the regional economy (pillar

1)

13.
This objective was to be attained by maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework, liberalizing
the economy, increasing i t s competitiveness through diversification and reduced factor costs, supporting
the growth potential o f some specific productive sectors (agricultureAivestock, water, urban, mining,
energy, transporthnfrastructure). The CAS objectives were relevant and well aligned with the PRSP.
These pre-requisites were mostly achieved, with the exception o f the diversification o f the
14.
economy. In view o f the country’s economic performance and good track record o f reform
implementation, this pillar’s objective i s considered achieved.
15.
The 2000 CAS had a specific goal o f helping the Government reduce the poverty headcount ratio
by at least 2 percentage points per year during the period 2000-2003. The recently completed Poverty
Assessment estimated that Burluna Faso has experienced substantial reduction in poverty, without
significant changes in inequality. The poverty headcount went down from an estimated 54.6 percent in
1998 to 46.4 percent in 2003, and both the poverty gap and i t s severity declined. The reduction in poverty
was more pronounced in rural areas, where the headcount f e l l from 61.1 percent in 1998 to 52.4 percent
in 2003 while i t was substantially smaller than in urban areas (from 22.4 to 19.2 percent) given the large
increase in cereal and cotton production since 1998 which was a year o f severe drought. Inequality
remained unchanged and higher in urban than rural areas.
16.
Burkina has achieved a stable macroeconomic environment with l o w inflation despite the external
shocks faced by the country during the CAS implementation (drought and erratic rainfall, Cbte d’Ivoire
crisis, fall in international cotton prices and increase in o i l prices, locust invasion, exchange rate
fluctuation between the dollar and the Euro, l o w predictability o f donor resources), the country performed
well in the face o f adverse external shocks through strong ownership o f the medium-term reform program,
sound fiscal policy through adjustment o f non-priority expenditure, and more liberalization, notably in
the transport sector and the opening up o f new trade routes in addition to Cbte d’Ivoire.

- 76 -

17.
Average economic growth during the CAS period i s 6.2 percent and average inflation was
contained at 2.1 percent. GDP growth in the period was led by the agriculture sector, notably cotton and
cereal production. Fiscal deficits remain consistent with available concessional extemal assistance.
Burkina Faso reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative in April 2004. The
prudent fiscal and monetary policies have helped maintain l o w inflation, thus mitigating the impact on the
real effective exchange rate of the appreciation o f the CFAF against the U S dollar. Overall, Burkina was
s t i l l able to maintain most of the competitiveness gained with the devaluation o f the CFAF in 1994. The
current account deficit, excluding grants, improved from 13.3 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 11.6 percent in
2004.

18.
Policv implementation record under the PRSCs has been good and gradually improved. During
200 1-2003, difficult external circumstances, trade shocks, weak revenue performance and the late
disbursement o f donor assistance in 2001 presented obstacles to a smooth implementation o f the PRSP.
Finally, Burkina Faso suffers from limited capacity in the absorption o f resources and monitoring their
use and effectiveness. The CAS period saw the implementation o f the utilities reform program with
progress in energy (electricity, rural electrification and o i l and gas), water, telecommunications,
transportation, and microfinance, although with delays in telecommunications and energy sectors, and in
privatization and efforts to create a favorable environment for development o f the private sector.
19.
On the privatization agenda, 44 state enterprises were liquidated or sold by end o f 2004. The
ongoing privatization program, which was adopted in 2001, consists o f 21 public enterprises, including
major utilities. The Government developed a telecommunications sector strategy, adopted a new
regulatory framework, and opened the sector to competition by issuing two cellular licenses. As a result,
telecommunications costs have been reduced over the past years. A sustained effort was deployed to
build the capacity o f the regulatory agency, which i s now considered as one o f the best performers in subSaharan Africa. The privatization o f O N A T E L (Ofice National des Tklkcommunications) reached the
point o f sale, but the market response has been disappointing. In some instances however, reforms were
subject to delays. I t took a long time for the Government to revisit the privatization strategy for
O N A T E L so as to re-launch the privatization process on the basis o f a 51 percent sale to a strategic
investor. Also, the restructuring o f the electricity sector (including the privatization o f the electricity
company SONABEL) required a longer timeframe than expected to develop and put in place the
regulatory framework. The cotton sector was opened to the private investors in 2004 with the sale of part
o f SOFITEX’S assets to two new strategic private investors and the creation o f two ginning companies
(FASOCOTON and SOCOMA), which i s part o f the privatizatiodliberalization agenda in the cotton
sector. The sector o f the retail distribution o f petroleum was opened to two new operators, and it has
become more competitive. There i s a need for greater high-level commitment to implement the
privatization program on time, particularly the utilities sector in order to boost the country’s
competitiveness.

The privatization agenda was supported by the PRSC program and the Competitiveness and
20.
Enterprise Development project, approved in FY03, which built on the 2001 comprehensive analysis of
competitiveness and long-term growth in Burkina Faso. In addition to the privatization and utility reform
agenda, the project provides support for: (i)improving the business environment, including red tape
alleviation, legal reform and arbitration; (ii)
building capacity o f regulatory agencies and other institutions
improving enterprise performance through business
involved in private sector development; (iii)
development services channeled through the “Maison de 1’Entreprise”; and (iv) strengthening
microfinanc e institutions.
21.
Vis-a-vis o f regional integration, Burkina Faso has had a good record in complying with the
provisions o f the West African Economic and Monetary Union’s (WAEMU) common external tariff.
Progress in overhauling domestic legislation to comply with the five WAEMU directives o n fiscal policy

- 77 -

has been made o n regulations, but given the country’s vulnerable economy, most convergence criteria
established by the WAEMU are not being complied with. On-going regional activities, o f which Burkina
trade and transport facilitation along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou-Niamey and
Faso i s involved include: (i)
the Lome-Ouagadougou corridors; (ii)
harmonization of the telecommunications regulatory framework;
(iii)
regional air transport safety oversight; and (iv) regional power market.

While the Bank’s intervention in the financial sector was limited during the CAS period since the
22.
sector had been assessed as sound by the Bank’s team, assistance has been provided in the form o f
support to micro-finance through the ongoing PACDE project, and through two regional activities: (i)a
regional project which financed the modernization o f the regional payment system led by BCEAO with
the establishment and operationalization o f a real time gross settlement system for large payments, and
the establishment o f an electronic clearing system for mass payment, expected to become operational by
end o f 2005; and (ii)
a 408 million dollars package, including an IDA line o f credit, technical assistance
from IDA, AFD and CIDA, and partial guarantees from IDA, MIGA and AFD to support the
modernization and development o f regional capital markets led by BOAD, and the regional regulator o f
capital markets (CREPMF). The payment system project will have achieved most o f i t s objectives when it
closes in the next few months.
23.
Little progress was made on economic diversification. The economy i s s t i l l very dependent on
cotton as the main export crop and therefore highly vulnerable to terms o f trade shocks. It has not
attracted the necessary level o f foreign direct investment to increase employment and incomes, owing to
poor economic infi-astructure and high transaction and input costs, l o w labor productivity, the limited size
o f the modem economy and important institutional weaknesses. The 200 1 Competitiveness and
Economic Growth report provided a good analysis o f constraints to growth and economic diversification
and some o f i t s recommendations were implemented under the Competitiveness and Enterprise
Development project in order to reduce factor costs and to improve governance but further efforts are
needed.
24.
Since production costs o f the enerm continue to impact negatively on economic competitiveness,
the Government sought to increase the competitiveness o f the economy by reducing production factor
costs through the provision and rational use o f electricity, and to support the improvement o f the growth
potential o f the energy sector, by encouraging and facilitating active participation o f communities, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector in meeting energy demand, especially in rural and
peri-urban areas. The CAS objective was relevant to the Government’s objective since it developed a
two-pronged approach to implement least-cost energy investment options in rural, peri-urban and urban
areas, together with adequate liberalization and regulation. The Government only recently set the path for
public-private partnership in the power sector, and in the energy sector in general, by switching from
favoring high-cost to least cost investment options, including interconnection with neighboring countries,
and an increased commitment to improve the sector policy and regulatory framework. This constituted a
major achievement for private sector and donor participation.

With the aim of reducing the input costs to industry, the interconnection o f the city o f Bobo25.
Dioulasso with the electrical power grid o f Cote d’Ivoire became operational in April 2001 to reduce the
input costs to industry. This interconnection will be extended through Ouagadougou under the recentlyapproved Power Sector Development Project (PDSP). The crisis in neighboring CGte d’Ivoire strained the
Burkinabk economy through, among others, frequent cut o f f o f the supply lines and higher transportation
costs. Because importing power from CGte d’Ivoire i s the main element o f the Government strategy for
reducing electricity costs, Burkina i s highly vulnerable to i t s external environment. In the rural areas,
many activities are ongoing in the area o f sustainable energy with community-based forest management,
promotion o f carbonization technology and promotion o f photovoltaic solar systems. These activities will
be scaled-up under the up-coming Energy Access project.

26.
The main objective in the transport sector was to increase people and goods mobility in a socially,
financially and economically sustainable manner, thus ensuring economic viability o f the country’s urban
and rural areas and improving people’s living conditions. The Bank’s assistance has been highly relevant
to Burkina’s development strategy o f economic reform programs and i t s emphasis on reducing subsidies,
increasing involvement o f the private sector in the provision o f services, and improving the efficiency and
quality o f such services.
27.
While the closed PASECT initially intended to restructure rather than privatize transport stateowned-enterprises, the Bank modified the railways and road passenger transport sub-components
following the Government’s decision to privatize these infrastructure’s sub-sectors. At project closure,
the institutional objectives o f the project were surpassed, and privatization was accomplished for several
activities. OED confirmed that the project had a significant impact on the promotion o f private sector
participation in the transport sector.
28.
The follow-up Transport sector project i s under implementation since mid-2003, with an
objective to decrease transport costs, increase the management capacity o f the Transport Ministry and
improve road network conditions and population mobility. I t s success will be assessed against a 10
percent decrease in non-urban road transport fares, a 20 percent decrease o f average access time to health
care facilities and primary schools in project intervention areas (MDG indicators), and a 100 percent
improvement o f classified road network condition.
29.
The Ouagadougou Water supply project, which i s part o f a US$206 million program supported by
11 donors, has been the main vehicle for the Bank’s support t o urban water supplv and sanitation. I t aims
at supporting the connection o f poor households to the water supply network, increasing access to
adequate and reliable potable water supply in Ouagadougou, and strengthening the management o f the
urban water sector. Implementation o f the overall program i s globally satisfactory. Access to water
connections and availability o f water has increased since the beginning o f the project. In the Capital,
o f 19 percent in the sale o f potable water from 15 million m3 in 200 1 to
there has been an increase: (i)
o f 20 percent in the number o f active water connections - from 36,800 in 2001
17.8 million in 2004; (ii)
to 45,800 in 2004; and (iii)in the number o f customers connected to the water supply from 360,000 to
500,000 from 2001 to 2004. As a result, about 40 percent o f the Ouagadougou population i s connected to
the water supply network and about 87 percent has access to water services. Built-in arrangements have
been developed to benefit the poor as costs o f connection to the water distribution system will be largely
reduced.

-

30.
In addition, the financial situation o f the national water and sanitation utility (ONEA) has
improved drastically and the management o f ONEA has substantially improved, and the urban water
sector has reached financial equilibrium with revenues generated by ONEA covering operating and debt
servicing costs without requiring Government subsidies. Efficiency improvements have been noticed as
operations and working ratios are following positive trends, as well as improved commercial and
operation indicators. The collection ratio for private customers’ water bills i s around 90 percent,
unaccounted water less than 20 percent and the cost o f a normal connection to the water supply network
has greatly been reduced. Moreover, the introduction o f the service contract managed by an intemational
joint venture o f a reputable water operator i s a first step towards a more deliberate private sector
participation in managing water supply services in Burkina Faso. I t i s expected that the project will help
the Govemment meet i t s objective o f more than doubling the volume o f water available and by having
about 500,000 additional persons connected to the water supply network.

31.
Bank intervention in the mining sector was relevant to the PRSP objectives since it provided
means to diversify sources o f growth for the Burkina economy.and targeted over 100,000 persons who

- 79 -

derive a livelihood from artisanal mining. The closed mining capacity building project (PRECAGEME)
supported the Government’s efforts to intervene directly in this sub-sector to strengthen the mining sector
fi-amework and to provide training, awareness, and sensitization as to the environmental, safety and health
hazards, and to increase the productivity o f artisanal miners. The results achieved by the Bank’s work in
the sector are good. Reforms o f legislation, taxation, and institutional strengthening were undertaken by
the project, attracting new private sector investments to the sector. To that effect, two or three new
industrial mines will open over the next two years. Also, provision o f essential services was made under
the project (power, water and transport infrastructure in the rural areas). This preempts a likely
sustainability o f the results, if international conditions are favorable and the sector and i t s revenues are
adequately managed.
32.
Progress on the Urban Environment Project and i t s supplemental credit has been satisfactory.
Most o f the physical works are completed or about to be completed, and benefited the population by
preventing flooding, limiting soil erosion and urban degradation and suppressing breeding grounds for
mosquitoes. Construction o f urban access roads has also facilitated access to poor neighborhoods and
reduced travel times. Primary schools in Ouagadougou are now equipped with appropriate sanitary
facilities and Ouagadougou i s the only capital city in western Afiica in which some primary schools have
working sanitary facilities financed with locally generated resources.
Bank instruments - This pillar was supported by the PRSC program, selected investment
33.
operations in the mining, private, transport and energy sectors as described above, and AAA to provide
support to develop better economic modeling tools and to prepare the PRSP revision with economic
simulations work. The Bank also conducted a review o f the regulatory framework in infrastructure, and
contributed to sectoral PERs and to MTEF. T o strengthen capacity building, training was provided to
members o f the Burkinabt: PRSP team in poverty analysis. The rural portfolio has also contributed to this
objective. This mix o f instruments has proven effective to achieve the pillar’s objectives.
Performance - i t has been satisfactory overall, with the exception o f the energy sector where the
34.
performance o f the Bank has been mixed. In the water sector for example, the Bank i s the lead agency
mandated by other donors to coordinate dialogue with the Government and large financier o f the water
supply network in Ouagadougou. I t has been instrumental in revamping the operational and commercial
efficiency o f ONEA, ensuring implementation o f an effective tariff policy, and spearheading the
development o f private sector involvement by introducing a service contract. In contrast, in the energy
sector, the Bank which re-engaged the dialogue in 1999 after more than 20 years o f absence, experienced
difficulties in building momentum around a cohesive energy policy and investment program among
donors and the Government, and over the sequencing o f reform and investment. However, following a
change in team leadership, there was a swift improvement in Bank performance, as indicated above by the
results achieved over a one-year period and the recent approval o f the PDSP. The Bank’s involvement
was critical for maximizing development impact by leading donor coordination in a program o f policy
and regulatory reforms and ensuring a coherent approach to sector investments. The Bank also brought
i t s knowledge and experience to the sector reforms and to the privatization process.

Supporting access o f the poor to basic social services (pillar 2)

35.
This higher level objective was supported by promoting access to the poor to education, health
the equity and efficiency o f
services and water. In the social sectors, the Bank aimed at improving: (i)
public expenditure for social services, through policy dialogue and public expenditure reviews; and
(ii)
access and efficiency o f social services.
36.
In the education sector, the CAS outcomes were relevant to the Government’s major PRSP
objectives to promote access to education services to the poor by increasing coverage o f basic education

- 80 -

and improving i t s quality, establishing a balance in the education system to respond to the needs o f the
economy, and developing a literacy program o f good quality to adults, especially women.

The Bank’s support to education focused on helping raise enrollment and completion rates,
37.
leaming outcomes and literacy rates. At the primary education level, Bank support was geared towards
implementing quality cost-effective programs to reach desired learning outcomes at affordable prices for
the poor. This involved targeting women and the poor in the provinces with the least coverage. The Bank
also supported the implementation o f the ten-year basic education development plan (PDDEB) which laid
out the reform o f education policies targeted at the reorganization and financing o f basic education,
institutional reform, improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness o f public expenditure on education.
The PDDEB started in 2002.
Steady progress has been made but challenges remain. Gross enrollment rates increased from 41.7
38.
percent in 1999-2000 to 52.3 percent in 2003-3004 and from 36.2 percent to 46 percent for girls. In the
20 most disadvantaged provinces, enrollment rates increased from 27.8 to 36.2 percent. The objectives to
increase education’s share o f public expenditures and to benefit the poorest and most vulnerable groups
have been fully met: Government and HlPC funds have been channeled specifically to the 20 priority
provinces with the lowest access to education services and funding levels have always been preserved.
Also, the aim to establish permanent literacy and training centers or non-formal basic educational centers,
and projects directed at women was fully met: Literacy training centers have been set up in rural areas,
particularly in the 20 priority provinces, and these centers also target women specifically. The number o f
centers offering initial literacy programs increased dramatically from 984 centers in 2003 to 1793 in 2004
and the number o f those registered in the initial literacy training program increased from 129,497 in 2001 to
182,323 in 2004. In the 20 priority provinces, the number increased by 46 percent, and the number o f
women who registered in the initial literacy program also increased by 43 percent, constituting 52 percent o f
the total registered in the program. Literacy training has been incorporated in a wider set o f activities and
services (such as health, education, credit, and extension services) through the PNGT project. According to
household survey, literacy rates increased from 18.4 to 21.8 percent between 1998 and 2003. Even if the
decentralized hiring o f primary school teachers i s not effective yet, progress was made as scheduled.

However, according to the PER, challenges remain in increasing quality and retention (60 percent
Unit costs in primary education remain high
(0.24 times per capita GDP) as a result o f high repetition rates which i s over 15 percent, and are mainly
the reflect o f supply constraints at the secondary level. Also, the implementation o f the institutional
reforms within the MEBA and increased efficiency in the use o f public funds in education goals have not
been met, mainly due to insufficient political commitment to put in place these reforms. The share o f budget
to the most decentralized department has continued but with poor execution rate.
39.

- 49 percent in rural areas and 41 percent for rural girls).

The Basic Education Sector Project, approved in FY02, i s the core element o f the Bank’s support
40.
to the PDDEB. The quality at entry for the project was judged overall satisfactory and i t s strategic
relevance highly satisfactory. However, implementation arrangements were rated marginally satisfactory.
Given the weak institutional capacity and organization o f the Ministry o f Basic Education,
implementation o f the very ambitious infrastructure encounters long delays. The Government i s now
committed to get the project back on track. A restructuring i s planned after the mid-year review o f the
project to address the current implementation constraints.
The Post-Primary Education Project closed in April 2004, with a satisfactory outcome. The
41.
transition rate from primary to secondary education increased from 27 percent in 1994 to 40 percent in
2002, surpassing the project target o f 35 percent. The number o f students at the secondary level increased
by 60 percent, surpassing the target o f a 42 percent increase. In particular, the proportion o f girls enrolled
at secondary level reached the target o f 40 percent.

42.
In the health sector, the Bank aimed at improving access and efficiency o f social services through
reduced costs for primary health services, ensuring availability o f essential drugs, promoting institutional
reforms, and strengthening community participation and approaches, including community management
committees (COGES). The CAS outcomes were relevant to the Government’s major PRSP objectives
which granted top priority to addressing the health problems o f the poorest segments o f the population, to
making essential health care affordable and to supporting the participation o f users and communities in
the development and management o f health care activities (e.g. develop community-based strategies,
strengthen the powers o f local management committees). The national health development strategy,
adopted in 2001, guides health sector policies.
43.
Overall, expected results were achieved although uneven. Addressing health problems o f the
poorest segments o f the population and making essential health care affordable were fully met while
supporting the participation of users and communities in the development and management o f health care
was onlypartially met. Most key health and service coverage indicators improved from 1999 to 2003:
(i)
child mortality declined from 219 to 184 per thousand; (ii)
use o f key preventative and curative
services increased, including child vaccination coverage (BCG 72 percent to 8 lpercent , and DTCP3 from
41 percent to 57 percent), antenatal care (CPN2 from 55 percent to 64 percent), and average number o f
) percentage o f men using condoms during
new contacts per year (0.2 in 2000 to 0.32 in 2003); and (iiithe
their most recent high-risk sexual contact increased from 59 percent to 69 percent from 1999 to 2003, and
the HIV prevalence rate among young women (aged 15-24) attending urban antenatal clinics declined
from 3.9 percent in 2001 to 1.9 percent in 2003.
44.
However, child malnutrition did not improve, with over a third o f children (under 5)
malnourished. Also, substantial progress was made in making basic curative and preventive health
service more affordable. Through HLPC support and the PRSCs, child vaccination was declared free o f
charge in 2002, and in 2003 prenatal care became free. The Government reduced the price margins on
essential drugs, which contributed to a 20 percent decline on average. Financial barriers have not been
entirely eliminated, and enforcement o f the new price structures needs to be further strengthened, but
these all contributed to increased use o f service by the poor.
T h e Government made limited progress in improving training o f the management committees for
45.
health centers (COGES) and piloting local health mutuelles (mutual insurance). While significant
progress was made in mobilizing communities for HIV awareness-raising in the 13 o f 45 pilot provinces
targeted by the MAP project, and in mobilizing communities and traditional leaders for vaccination
campaigns, community participating in health remains relatively weak, with the COGES mainly focused
on managing cost recovery funds. The process for revising the COGES guidelines has begun, however.

As noted in i t s ICR, the Bank played a pivotal role in supporting the development o f health
46.
districts and in channeling funds directly to districts and regional authorities through the Health and
Nutrition Project, which closed in September 200 1. The decentralization o f financial resources and use o f
management agreements enhanced ownership and accountability at all levels o f the health system. The
Population and A I D S Control Project, which also closed in September 2001, supported the Government’s
HN/AIDS national program through assisting in raising awareness, strengthening treatment o f
opportunistic infections and sexually transmitted infections, and supporting NGOs and associations. The
HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project was approved under the Multi-Country HN/AIDS Program for the
Africa region. I t i s implemented through the same experienced coordinating unit that managed the latter
projects. I t s quality at entry was considered satisfactory, especially in terms o f project design, piloting o f
key activities, tapping country and sector knowledge and M&E, but some weaknesses in terms o f
environmental and implementation arrangements were noted. Despite many conditions o f effectiveness,
the project i s fully committed and a Supplemental grant i s under preparation to ensure continuity in

- 82 -

priority activities, while a new project i s being prepared in parallel with the development o f a new
National HIV/AIDS Strategy (2006-20 10).
Instruments - Their nature and mix o f the Bank lending has evolved during the CAS
47.
implementation. From traditional investment operations, the Bank has switched i t s assistance
programmatic budget support and selected investment operations to strengthen the delivery o f social
services at the local level, and the provision o f water and urban infrastructure services. This evolution in
the choice o f instruments has proven effective. The PRSCs have contributed to reduce costs o f social
services and facilitated dialogue on key reforms, even if implementation has been slow. But
complementary efforts by Government and other partners were also essential in assuring availability o f
resources for service delivery by health districts, particularly given that availability and execution
delegated credits (Government budget) improved more slowly than anticipated. Total allocations to health
and the percent o f the budget going to the decentralized level have increased since 200 1.

48.
The Bank’s AAA program also contributed to the financing o f studies (Health Status Report,
P H R D studies under PRSC3-5, Social Protection note), and the issues faced by the social sectors were
addressed in the Poverty Assessment and the Public Expenditure Reviews. The studies fed the
Government’s sectoral strategies and the preparation o f the revised PRSP.
Performance - has been moderately satisfactoy. In the education sector, there has been a
49.
significant improvement in outcome indicators. The Bank has played a key role in clarifying the roles
and responsibilities among donors and between the donors and the Government in order to improve
coordination. However, there i s room for improvement for a better coordination among donors vis-&vis
o f the Government and activities. The Bank has failed to take early action to remedy the fact that
progress o f the Basic Education Sector Project have been measured based on the education program
rather than on the specific contribution o f the Project. Also, despite technical and financial assistance for
the basic education sector, the MEBA has experienced delays in major institutional reforms due to the
lack of a clear decision line within the Ministry and lack o f commitment to take the necessary measures to
put in place the required institutional reforms. The latter issue was brought to the attention o f the Prime
Minister late 2004 who formed a committee to identify the constraints and follow up on the
implementation o f activities.

50.
In the health sector, positive evolution o f key indicators and a constant constructive dialogue with
c i v i l society, and partners characterized the Government’s commitment in this sector. T h e shift from
project to program support was initially perceived by the Ministry o f Health and some partners as
disengagement, but the Bank’s strong and continued engagement in key policy issues affecting the sector
(financial access, budget, human resources, etc.) i s n o w widely appreciated by Government and partners.
5 1.
Sustainability - The implementation o f PDDEB has proven difficult because o f lack o f clarity in
the decision line o f MEBA, and high transaction costs due to donor requirements. The Government i s
committed to implement the mechanism to subsidize school supplies in the 20 provinces with lowest
school enrollment rates and has continued to waive school fees for girls. However, there were delays in
some areas, notably in school construction and the transfer o f responsibilities o f hiring teacher to the
decentralized levels (region). The objectives o f the PDDEB to build about 2,300 classroom each year was
not achieved in 2002/2003 (1000 classrooms) and in 2003/2004 (2000 classrooms). With the recent
creation o f an inter-ministerial committee, the Government seems to now be fully committed to tackle the
challenges o f the education system. On the donor side, there i s a clear need to formalize the roles and
responsibilities for better donor coordination.
In the health sector, the Government continued to implement a vaccination campaign, and most
52.
PRSP targets for vaccination rates have been met. There has also been a modest pick-up in health center

- 83 -

usage rates, but further efforts as regards resource flows to health centers and health center staffing are
necessary to improve health care coverage and quality. Significant improvements have also been made in
increasing the supply o f drinking water, and almost 70 percent o f the population now has access to safe
water, compared to 42 percent in 1998, putting Burkina Faso on track for the respective MDG.
Supporting opportunities for employment and income-generating activities for the poor (pillar 3)

53.
The Government’s rural agenda called for: (i)
an improvement o f the growth potential o f specific
productive sectors; (ii)
a reduction in the vulnerability o f agricultural activities; (iii)
intensification and
modernization o f agriculture; (iv) an increase and diversification o f rural income; and (v) promotion o f
local govemance.
54.
The CAS objectives were fully in line with the PRSP objectives and aimed at supporting the
development o f non traditional agricultural exports, promoting soil fertility and water conservation
technologies, boosting o f farm mechanization, supporting the increase o f the competitiveness o f cotton
sector, and empowering local communities to manage their own development.
55.
Overall, achievements o f stated objectives are considered met with the exception o f the
intensification and modernization o f apculture which i s partially met. More specifically, support to the
improvement o f the growth potential o f specific productive sector has beenfully met. A new cooperative
law was prepared allowing the set up o f 13 regional chambers o f agriculture and the creation o f the interprofessional association o f private sector organization (APIPAC). The involvement o f APIPAC and
producers organization in service delivery has facilitated and increased farmers’ access to markets, inputs
and technology.
Also, the established guarantee fund has allowed approval o f over 100 loans by
commercial banks to finance micro-projects for private irrigation, representing 144 millions CFA.
56.
The focus of efforts on the cotton, fruit and vegetable sectors has led to an increase o f production,
exports and farmers’ income. Total amount paid to farmers for seed cotton production increased from 80
billions CFA to 100 billions CFA from 2000 to 2004, and exports o f fruits and vegetables increased by 1
billion CFA in 2002. Sheanut exports also expanded with support from the Canadians. T h i s has
contributed to increase and diversify rural income, but more support to non traditional supply chains and
to diversification to enable the private sector to seize market opportunities in sub-regional and
international trade i s needed since private investment, innovation and marketed volumes have remained
minimal.
57.
During the CAS period, the approach to extension and research has evolved toward a more
demand-driven approach for agriculture services delivery. The activities under the Second National
Agricultural Services Development Project (PNDSA 11) were redirected during i t s mid term review in
June 2001 to adapt to the revised approach. The new approach to extension allowed producers to develop
2,700 micro-projects in the amount o f CFAF 4.5 billion. Despite positive achievements in institutional
capacity, relationships between producers and agricultural services, the PNSDA I1 closed in December
2004 with unsatisfactory ratings o n i t s development objectives and implementation. I t s implementation
was hampered by long delays in civil work and equipment for research institutions, INERA and IRSAT,
difficulties in adapting to the demand-driven approach and unclear modalities for the fruit processing
facility at project closure.
58.
A lot o f technologies have been generated by research using a participatory approach for
improving farming techniques and soil fertility so as to increase farm productivity, especially in cotton.
Fertilizer formulas that are deemed economically productive have been constantly improved, as technical
progress and the market economy have allowed. This has provided cotton growers with savings o f 10
percent in the cost o f fertilizer. However, their dissemination i s limited due to lack o f credit to facilitate

- 84 -

access to input equipment and technology, except for cotton and small scale irrigation. Hence,
mechanization rates remain l o w although it has improved during CAS implementation. For example, the
mechanization rate in cotton producing areas increased from 35 percent in 2000 to 50 percent in 2004.
Extension services were provided to 15 percent o f the country‘s farmers, covering 737,986 producers,
40.4 percent o f whom are women. These outreach activities have achieved a 52 percent adoption rate for
new technologies, covering 56 percent o f the total crop area, and providing 400 dumper-carts and farming
inputs for extremely poor farmers, with CFAF 313,620,000 in HIPC funding.
59.
The pilot Private Irrigation project was complementary to the PNDSA 11, and tested and
evaluated approaches for the provision o f demand-driven support services necessary to develop an
efficient, sustainable small irrigation sub-sector in Burkina Faso. I t closed as satisfactory in December
2004. Among i t s key achievements has been the multiplication by a factor 100 o f the incomes generated
by irrigated vegetable crops, and the emergence o f artisans and private service providers. The small
irrigation program has been very effective in developing appropriate technologies such as treadle pumps
(more than 1,500 treadle pumps bought by small farmers - original objective o f 300 treadle pumps) that
have proven their efficiency in increasing rural poor, especially women income, and contributed to reduce
the vulnerability o f agricultural activities. A 25 percent increase was registered from 2000 to 2004 in the
adoption o f soil fertilityjwater conservation technologies, which i s considered a very good achievement.

The Community Based Rural Development Project’s first phase (PNGT 11, C D D program) was
60.
approved in 2001. I t s main objective i s to improve revenues and living conditions o f rural populations by
providing support to the development o f the capacity o f rural inhabitants to manage sustainable, equitable,
and productive development, and by helping to facilitate the emergence o f rural municipalities. The C D D
program contributed to the promotion o f local governance. It i s currently covering 26 provinces totalizing
4500 villages, almost doubling the 5-year objective set for the first phase o f the program. The program
created a new dynamic in the rural area and allowed communities to acquire the capacity to prepare and
implement local development plans. About 26,000 people have been trained and about 4 billions C F A
have been transferred to communities for the implementation o f the local development plans. The PNGT
I1 already assisted rural people in setting up more than 600 Village Land Management Committees
(CVGT). Between 2000 and 2002, a CVGT was created in 623 villages, and a Land Management Plan
(PGT) was introduced in 565 villages. The decentralized financial system i s now covering all the 45
Provinces compared to a coverage rate o f 70 percent in 2000. T h e C D D program and PNDSA also
contributed substantially to improve soil fertility and land tenure issue, and PNGT I1 to improve land
tenure security, with a pilot activity and the Terrafrica action plan.
61.
T o complement the PNGT I1and support large-scale conservation activities in rural communities
and the forest/wildlife administration, the GEF Partnership for Natural Ecosystem Management Project
(PAGEN) was approved in FY02. Another GEF, the Sahel Integrated Lowland Ecosystem Management
(SILEM), approved in June 2004, will support to strengthening o f rural communities’ capacity in
assessing, planning and managing their natural resources and local development, and empower them for
decision making and dialogue with Government and other partners.
Bank instruments - The combination o f steady flows o f budgetary support, selected project
62.
lending, and high-quality analytical work was adequate. Also, to mitigate natural disasters and social
risks, the Bank has proved flexible in amending the Second National Agricultural Services Development
Project to enhance assistance to farmers’ organizations to provide services to the returning Burlunabk, and
approved in FY05 a regional emergency locust program. Several studies for the diversification o f crops
were undertaken and numerous measures to increase agricultural productivity and access to financing
taken (rural roads built, selected financing made available).

- 85 -

63.
Performance - has been Satisfactory. The Government was very effective in defining a sound
policy framework for rural development, and managing, monitoring and evaluating projects and
programs. I t succeeded to timely liberalize the cotton sector which became one o f the most successful in
the sub region. Also, counterpart funding was timely and fully provided to projects. Recognizing that
agriculture has a key role in the economy, employing 90 percent o f the population, the Government has
paid special attention to promoting agricultural exports (fruits and vegetables, cotton, etc.), while
strengthening food security through small-scale irrigation works to promote off-season crops. The Bank
was effective in working in a participatory way with the Government and in pamership with other
donors. For example, in the framework o f the C D D program, donors agreed to harmonize their approach
and to work in synergy. Donors also agreed to harmonize support to farmers’ organization based on the
results o f the PNDSA.
Sustainability - The challenge will be to scale up the good results achieved during the CAS
64.
period and ensure an environment conducive for sustainability. T o that end, the finalization and
consolidation o f the liberalization process, focusing on the establishment o f the cotton inter-professional
association and i t s efficient management o f the technical, financial development o f the cotton sector to
make it more competitive i s important. Also, special emphasis should be put on: (i)
capacity building for
cotton producer organizations, and o f the Government’s body in charge o f arbitrage, monitoring and
control o f the liberalization o f Burkma’s cotton sector; (ii)
promotion o f cotton productivity with special
focus on soil fertilization management; (iii)
establishment o f a comprehensive risk management strategy;
and (iv) promotion o f small cotton processing technologies and units. A demonstrative unit has been
implemented in Bobo-Dioulasso by an ONUDI funded project. In addition, enabling the private sector to
stimulate private investment in agricultural supply chains in order to contribute to increased growth and
employment generation, and facilitating farmers’ organization leadership in the development o f
agribusiness activities should be a major Government’s objective through a combination o f policy
measures and capacity building investments.

Supporting good governance and institutional reform (pillar 4)
65.
The PRSP presents four guiding principles to improve governance: (i)adopting a more
comprehensive approach to public finance management to ensure that public funds are managed under
consistent and transparent rules, and in conformity with internationally accepted good practices;
(ii)
reducing Government intervention and discretion in economic activity; (iii)
making the Government
more accountable by increasing participation o f electoral bodies, civil society groups and the private
sector in policy design, implementation, and monitoring; and (iv) ensuring a more efficient use o f public
revenues by focusing public policy evaluation on results on the ground. Another objective, fostering
decentralization, i s at the center stage o f the Government’s strategy to improve public administration’s
performance and citizen’s participation.

66.
T o support the need for improved public sector performance, the CAS focused on budget
formulation, implementation and external auditing, and on the deconcentration and decentralization
agendas, mainly through AAA and the PRSCs.
Results have been mixed. Vis-a-vis o f public sector management and economic governance,
67.
substantial progress has been made. A variety o f important policy reforms have been undertaken which
resulted in improved budget formulation, execution, reporting and control, improved transparency in
fiscal management, and laid the groundwork for the deconcentration and decentralization o f public
services. M a i n accomplishments have been: (i)
preparation o f global MTEFs and full integration in
budget preparation cycle in 2002-3003 which led to increased realism o f revenue targets and improved
budget arbitration; (ii)full operationalization o f the computerized expenditure management system;
(iii)
establishment o f program budgets and carrying public expenditures reviews in education, health,

- 86 -

infrastructure, and rural development sectors piloted by a PER supervision Committee since 2003;
(iv) action plan for the deconcentration o f budgetary expenditure, as part o f the decentralization process,
for which a successful pilot experiment was conducted at Bobo-Dioulasso in 2003, and led to the
expansion o f the program to four other regions in 2004; (v) adoption o f a new procurement code in 2003
to improve the transparency and efficiency o f Government purchasing; (vi) creation o f an independent
Supreme Audit Court and i t s operationalization in 2002; and (vii) submission o f budget execution reports
to the audit court for the years 1996-2001. To Wher strengthen control, the National Assembly adopted
a new law regulating budget laws in 2003, aligning national law with WAEMU directive.
In addition to public expenditure reforms, the Government reinforced governance aspects by
68.
continuing to strengthen the institutional system to fight fraud and corruption. T o that effect, it has
established the High Authority for the Coordination against Corruption in 2002 which became operational
in 2003. Also, the budget execution reports through 2003 have been evaluated by the Supreme Audit
Court and the National Assembly. In the area o f justice reform, progress has been made with the adoption
o f a decree in July 2002 that marks the beginning o f the effort to rehabilitate the judiciary system and
initiatives to increase knowledge and access to justice. But the revised National Plan for Good
Governance, planned for 2004, could not be agreed upon by the Govemment and its development
partners. Also, procurement regulations have been strengthened and the gap between unit prices o f
products obtained by public bidding and those obtained by the private sector has been reduced.

69.
However, progress on broader public administration reform and decentralization agendas has
been limited during the CAS period, with substantial delays in implementing the Comprehensive Reform
o f Public Administration, adopted in 1998, in securing and deconcentrating the integrated human
resources database in line ministries, and in transferring resources and responsibilities beyond urban

communes, where the transfers nonetheless remain limited. Although the legal framework was created to
delegate credits to regions and provinces and to deconcentrate the issuance o f payment orders to
accelerate delivery o f basic services, additional reductions in the time i s needed to issue payment orders.
New personnel management system and performance reviews were instituted and the framework for role
and attribution o f governors adopted to implement the decentralization laws, and the computerized civil
service payroll and salary management system (SIGASPE) finalized. It now has to be deconcentrated and
implemented at the regional and local levels. Recent progress i s to be noticed with three local
communities now operating the software for the integrated management system, helping to increase
accountability in the management o f public resources at the local level, and the 13 governors o f regions
who took office in December 2004.
70.
Further improvement i s needed, in particular vis-&vis the level o f budget deconcentration and the
integration o f program budgets with the traditional budget. While execution rates for the social sector
budget stayed high, the size o f deconcentrated budget in health and the execution rates in the education
system are s t i l l limited. Four ministries are now beneficiaries o f delegated credits, and the Ministry o f
Secondary Education i s expected to receive delegated credits in 2005.
In the area of decentralization, the institutional reorganization o f the Ministry o f Territorial
71.
Administration and Decentralization (MATD) took place in 2002 and the legal guidelines on
decentralization were revised to reflect the new organizational system for decentralization supplemented
in 2001 with the establishment o f regions. Since then, almost n o progress was made until recently. The
adoption o f the new Decentralization Code in December 2004 puts an end to the debates o f the last few
years on the final shape o f the territorial system o f Burkina Faso, which were paralyzing the operational
implementation o f the reform. N o w that the Province’s final status has been clarified and that communal
elections are planned for 2005 and regional ones in 2007, it will be possible to re-focus on the difficult
tasks o f the concrete operational mechanisms for the implementation o f the reform.

- 87 -

72.
Bank instruments - The Bank’s support to promoting good governance has been two-fold: the
PRSC program and key analytical reports, including the Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR), the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the joint Bank-IMF HIPC
Assessments and Action Plan (AAP) o f public expenditure management, the fiscal management
improvement program, and the Report on Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC). In a continued
effort to bring greater transparency to the budgetary process, a number o f expenditure reviews were
conducted in health, basic education, rural development and road construction. Also, a Public
Expenditure Review (PER) was carried out in FY04.
73.
The selection of these instruments provedjudicious. The PRSC program has been instrumental in
supporting budget, civil service and decentralization reforms. The AAA program greatly contributed to
the Government’s key policy reforms and sector strategies and the Bank’s preparation o f future projects.
The C F A A recommendations contributed to the budget management reform plan adopted in July 2002.
The ESW on Improving Service Delivery at the Local Level: Challenges for Public Management Reform,
highlighted current weaknesses o f public sector arrangements in Burkina, in particular the lack o f vision
for decentralization, and helped design the Administration Capacity Building project, which identification
started in October 2002. The project aims to operationalize the decentralization agenda, strengthen the
Administration and M&E capacities, streamline the public administration structure, improve personnel
management has been prepared. I t s presentation to the Board o f Directors i s scheduled end o f March
2005. The PER showed that priority spending has risen under the PRSP and priority sectors have been
well protected from budget cuts.
Performance - has been Satisfactory. Implementation o f budget management reform can be
74.
considered successful, even though it i s s t i l l a work-in-progress. In particular, the level o f budget
deconcentration and the integration o f program budget with the traditional budget need to be improved.
In terms of broader governance areas, and in particular for civil service reform and decentralization,
performance has been relatively weak, but recent key positive developments vis-a-vis the decentralization
agenda anticipates good prospects.

75.
Sustainability - The Government’s performance in the area o f budget management has shown
results and crucial steps, such as the implementation o f an integrated financial management system, are
being sustained. The improved governance i s more than likely going to be sustained, especially with the
implementation o f the decentralization and deconcentration agendas and the public management and
public sector reforms.
C.

Measuring Bank Performance

76.
Portfolio, lending and AAA performance - The CAS progress report rated the implementation o f
the FYO1-03 CAS as satisfactory, indicating that the project portfolio had performed well and nearly all
lending operations outlined in the CAS have been approved. I t also underlined the contribution made by
key AAA in helping the Government lay out key policy reforms and sector strategies, and the Bank in
preparing well-targeted new lending interventions. The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) also reviewed
the 2000-2003 AAA program and rated it satisfactory, with strategic relevance highly satisfactory.

77.
Overall, the portfolio performance has continued to be satisfactory. I t s riskiness has been low,
reflecting on average one problem project a year. However, i t s implementation pace has been slow. The
approval-effectiveness lag has increased for investment projects and delays in effectiveness have reached
over nine months, mainly due to the Burkinabk administrative procedures. However, effectiveness delays
have decreased for budget support operations, hence room for improvement to ensure prompt
effectiveness o f future investment projects.

- 88 -

.

78.
Despite continued efforts to strengthen financial management and procurement systems, some
fiduciary risks with regard to the use of public funds remain, due to weak quality o f internal and external
controls o f project teams, and a lack o f financial reporting. Procurement issues are a key factor in slow
portfolio implementation, with very long delays in contract execution. Also, the institutional capacity in
implementing projects i s s t i l l weak.

During the CAS period, WBI’s intervention has gradually shifted from ad hoc training to capacity
79.
building activities. This emphasis o n a longer term and more strategic role o f the Institute in the country
i s supported by the fact that Burkina Faso was selected in FY03 as a WBI focus country. A Country
Program Brief endorsed by the Country Team and updated annually now serves as the main instrument
for aligning WBI activities on the PRSP and CAS and tailoring them to the country’s needs. Programs
that were delivered during the CAS period started to address themes such as HIV/AIDS, PRSP
preparation, rural development, community empowerment and decentralization. These are indeed key
issues and instruments for the country to meet i t s development challenges. T o increase i t s impact in the
country, WBI now needs to focus on strengthening synergy with lending operations and AAA. The new
CAS will provide an excellent opportunity to achieve that goal.
80.
Delayed effectiveness, slow implementation and fiduciary constraints have impacted on the
disbursement ratio which declined substantially in FY02-03, at 14 and 13.3 percent respectively. The
disbursement ratio increased to 20 percent in FY04 but several projects have very l o w disbursement ratio,
and will not be able to fully disburse by their current closing date if n o acceleration in their
implementation pace occurs.
Over the CAS period, The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) rated project quality at entry at 100
8 1.
percent for the two adjustment projects it assessed, and at 75 percent for the four investments projects
reviewed. Quality o f supervision was rated at 100 percent (only two projects assessed).

82.
T h e Operations Evaluation Department (OED) evaluated seven projects. For all o f them, OED
rated their sustainability as likely and for 71 percent their outcome as satisfactory or moderately
satisfactory and their impact as high or substantial. While quality at entry was considered unsatisfactory
for five o f the projects, overall Bank and Borrower performance were rated satisfactory for six o f them.
All ICRs reviewed were rated satisfactory and the HealtWutrition project was considered as exemplary.

The portfolio composition has changed during the CAS period, reflecting the Bank’s approach to
83.
increasingly support the PRSP through programmatic budget support, and concentrate i t s investment
operations o n large infrastructures, and community-driven development operations. The Bank has also
been flexible in adapting i t s portfolio and lending pipeline in order to mitigate social and natural disaster
risks, as exemplified by the amendment to the PNDSA I1project and the recent approval o f the Regional
Locust project.
84.
Portfolio management i s decentralized to the Country Office in Ouagadougou. During the CAS
period, two Country portfolio performance reviews (CPPR) were carried out. The first one took place in
2002 and concluded that the most critical issues were on effectiveness and start-up delays, and weak
absorptive capacity due to lack o f decentralization and a cumbersome procurement system. The 2004
CPPR developed a results-based approach. I t reiterated the 2002 CPPR findings and underscored the
inadequacy o f monitoring systems, although increased monitoring and evaluation capacities and more
institutionalized M&E system were noted for the most recently approved projects.

At the country level, progress in establishing a better M&E system was made during the CAS
85.
period and was reflected by the definition o f a set o f outcome indicators for poverty monitoring in the
priority sectors, the creation o f ONAPAD (Obsewatoire National de la Pauvreti et du Ddveloppement

- 89 -

Humain Durable) to monitor poverty and sustainable development, the establishments o f sectoral and
thematic committees, and the implementation o f several surveys to measure the extent and nature of
poverty. In 2004, during the revised PRSP process, the Government broadened the set o f monitoring

indicators, and provided a logical framework and an investment program with a detailed costing through
the preparation o f a detailed Priority Action Plan (PAP). The PAP constitutes a major achievement for
better monitoring o f PRSP implementation and results.

86.
Coordination with other donors has been particularly strong, albeit challenging, on budget
support, which was regulated by a Memorandum o f Understanding with other development partners. The
Bank and the AfDB could not s i g n the original budget support MOU, developed by the budget support
group SBC (soutien budge‘taire conjoint) led by the EU and a few bilateral donors, because o f a narrow
definition o f disbursement conditions. A new framework for budget support that includes the Bank and
the AfDB has been adopted in January 2005.
87.
With regard to investment lending, the Bank has been active in collaborating closely with other
donors to ensure consistency in the country policy dialogue, and a division o f labor in lending and non
lending services. Examples include support to the education sector, HIV/AIDS and water supply, all of
which have developed a strong donors’ coordination.
88.
In the case o f education, the ten-year education program has been the framework for all donor
interventions. A partnership agreement was signed by 13 donors and the Government for their support to
basic education, with Canada playing the role o f coordinator o f donors. Common fiduciary arrangements,
procurement procedures, accounting and financial management between Canada, Netherlands and the
Bank were to be set up but a clear implementation framework was never prepared. This led to
coordination problems and tensions between donors.
89.
NGOs and c i v i l society have become integral partners in the PRSP and all development activities
in Burkina Faso. More donors are channeling their resources to national and international NGOs, village
associations and municipal Governments. The H I V / A I D S Disaster Response Project i s being
implemented in collaboration with other donors and a range o f NGOs, village associations and other civil
society groups. Partnership has also become increasingly important in all rural development activities:
farmers organizations have recently demonstrated their capacity to take on more management and
planning responsibility o f their development, and community organizations and communes are planning
and organizing their local affairs, land resources and infrastructure, and are managing forests.

90.
Lessons learned Despite all the gains described above and the good economic track record, there
remain important challenges that need to be addressed so as to devise strategies that help sustain high propoor growth rates, reduce poverty and attain the MDGs.

The following lessons emerge from the implementation o f the 2000 CAS and draw upon the
91.
challenges ahead:
0

0

The medium-term macroeconomic outlook i s compounded by i t s vulnerability to adverse economic
external developments and shocks. This presents a challenge, necessitating corrective measures such
as diversification o f trade links and transport infrastructure in order to raise productivity, especially in
the rural sector, and investment rates, and a more developed private sector and better access to credit
for the private sector.
More emphasis o n regional dimensions i s needed to ensure the country’s successful involvement in
the regional integration and globalization process, and give the country access to larger markets.

- 90 -

Rainfall patterns remain the predominant deteminant o f agricultural output. Raising effectiveness o f
rural development spending to increase the benefits o f growth for rural population remains one o f the
key challenges in attaining the income-poverty MDG.
Growth in the primary sector has been mainly driven by the expansion o f agricultural surfaces in light
o f improved rainfalls. These growth rates cannot be sustained over a long period unless they are
accompanied by higher mechanization and fertilizer use to increase productivity and maintain soil
fertility, and increased agricultural diversification.
The main focus during the CAS period by both the Government and donors has been o n basic
education, thus not achieving a better balance between the various levels o f the education system to
lay the foundation for needs o f future workforce.
Despite substantial progress achieved in the enrollment o f girls in school, access o f rural women to
agricultural extension services, and participation o f women in political bodies, the persistence of
systemic legal and socio-cultural barriers to women’s empowerment entails that women’s social and
economic status and welfare remains weak.
In the urban sector, assistance during the CAS period has been mainly targeted to Ouagadougou. The
rapid urbanization o f the population will strongly burden secondary cities which already suffer from
lack of investment, limited and dilapidated stock o f infrastructure, poor urban services and weak
administrative, financial and human resources. The donors’ assistance will have to be re-directed to
correct this imbalance.
Continued weak country capacity hampered implementation capacity, particularly in line ministries.
The Burlunabb administration i s plagued by inefficiencies and poor human resource policies. The
Bank needs to continue to support the Government in budgetary management, decentralization and
deconcentration through the PRSC program and the Administration capacity buildingproject in order
to help the Government strengthen its capacity and improve delivery o f services.

The design o f the PRSC recognized that complementarity o f efforts between programmatic
92.
support and investment lending was key to making efficient use o f Bank resources. This proved to be a
key element in progress achieved during the CAS. For example, the main focus in agriculture o f the
PRSC program has been on opening up the cotton sector to the private sector and institutional reforms
and the three rural sector investment credits have addressed specific issues that could not easily be
replicated through budget support.
93.
Q A G conducted a review o f the PRSC-1 and concluded that the overall quality at entry and Bank
processes were satisfactory, and the results o f PRSC-1 likely to be sustained. It agreed that the strong
emphasis on improving resource management and accountability would help improve the effectiveness of
service delivery, especially in education and health. The ICRs for the first PRSC series concluded that
the programmatic instrument supported the focus o n the budget as the main instrument for the PRSP
implementation and noted the accomplishments in strengthening expenditure and control systems and in
supporting cross-cutting reforms, among them the application o f deconcentration policies in budget and
personnel management. I t also noted that strong focus in the coming years should be on helping stimulate
growth, improving the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue, better aligning budget support with the budget
cycle, reinforcing the capacity o f the Administration to formulate and execute programs, and improving
the link between policy actions and the M&E framework. Since PRSC-4, the Bank has started to better
align i t s programmatic development lending operations with the Burkinabk budget cycle. Also, the
revised PRSP adopted last October 2004 by the Authorities, n o w integrates a detailed Priority Action
Plan, which should contribute to improve social expenses efficiency.
