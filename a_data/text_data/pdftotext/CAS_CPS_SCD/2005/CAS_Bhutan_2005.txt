FY06-09 COUNTRY ASSISTANCESTRATEGY FORTHE KINGDOM OF BHUTAN

EXECUTIVE
S~R~R~ARY
1.
Bhutan, landlocked and with a difficult terrain and widely dispersed population, has made
rapid socioeconomic progress. As a result of prudent macroeconomic management, exploitation o f
hydropower resources, and substantial support from donors, the country has had a good economic
performance, with GDP growth averaging over 6 percent a year, and close to 8 percent over the past
5 years. Government investment in social and human development has resulted in measurable
improvements in the well-being o f the Bhutanese people, and good progress towards meeting several
of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs).

2.
Development Vision and Poverty Reduction Strategy. As the last remaining Himalayan
Buddhist kingdom, Bhutan i s concerned with preserving i t s culture, environment, and identity.
While economic growth i s considered important, creating an environment where every individual
can seek and achieve happiness has been chosen as a major goal. Accordingly, the Royal
Government o f Bhutan (RGoB) i s pursuing a holistic path o f change framed by a unique and
homegrown development vision: Gross National Happiness (GNH), which i s underpinned by four
pillars that further define the effort to balance spiritual and material advancement-sustainable
socioeconomic development, conservation and sustainable use o f the environment, promotion o f
culture, and good governance.

3.
A l l policy and planning documents, projects, programs, and legislation strive to make the
concept o f GNH operational. The country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), underpinned
by the Ninth Five Year Development Plan (9FYP), reflects this vision through concrete objectives
and strategies, including improving quality of l i f e and income especially for the poor; promoting
private sector growth and employment; strengthening governance, particularly at the decentralized
level; and promoting culture and environmental conservation.
4.
Development Challenges. Finding a place in a globalized world i s a major challenge for a
small state such as Bhutan, which only started opening to the world recently. The country’s small
and dispersed population and formidable climate and topography make it difficult to achieve
economies o f scale in service delivery, and costly to build and maintain vital infrastructure.
Employment generation, particularly for youth, i s an emerging concern. Importantly, there are
implicit tradeoffs in the country’s development vision that require close attention given their
implications for economic growth and employment.
5.
In the medium term, the timing and net impact o f Tala Hydropower Project (1020
megawatts-xpected
to come on stream in 2006-will be critical for economic growth and the
development efforts o f RGoB. Overall, hydropower development has been beneficial, even while
increasing Bhutan’s reliance on a single commodity exported to a single market and strengthening
the role o f the public sector in the economy. The private sector, which faces major constraints,
remains small and underdeveloped and cannot yet provide sufficient and attractivejob opportunities.
As such, when hydropower i s set aside, a different picture o f the country emerges, with a majority of
the population largely dependent on subsistence-level agricultural activities and some areas o f the
country sdll outside o f the modern economy. I n this context, access to social services and markets i s
critical to ensure the equitable and balanced growth aspired to by the country.

11

Executive Summary

6.
Lessons f r o m the Previous CAS. As learned from OED’s Country Assistance Evaluation
and the CAS Completion Report, to maximize development impact, Bank assistance needs to
emphasize selectivity, which should be balanced with flexibility in order to best respond to new
client needs and changing country and global conditions. As a corollary, the lending program should
also be better informed regarding local conditions. On the other hand, supply-driven assistance
should be avoided, particularly in regard to non-lending services. Strong donor coordination i s
required in order to enhance development effectiveness. In addition, it is important that the Bank be
more sensitive to Bhutan’s capacity constraints.
World Bank Group Strategy. The FY06-09 CAS i s selectively aligned with Bhutan’s
7.
vision and the priorities and goals o f the 9FYPPRSP. Accordingly, during the CAS period, the
Bank Group will help Bhutan (i)expand access to better infrastructure and quality o f social services,
and connect communities to markets; (ii)promote private sector development and employment; and
(iii)strengthen management o f public resources, and monitoring and evaluation o f development
outcomes. The Bank Group w i l l also provide support to the Royal Government’s crosscutting efforts
to promote decentralization, good governance, and environmental management.
CAS
implementation w i l l emphasize partnerships with donors and the promotion o f the harmonization
agenda, while building capacity to facilitate increased reliance on country systems. A monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) framework i s outlined in the CAS result matrix, which will be the basis for
assessing progress o f CAS implementation as well as achievement o f CAS outcomes and Bank
contribution to these outcomes.
8.
Bhutan i s a full IDA grant country in FY06, with an allocation o f US$14.5 million. For the
first time, the Bank will provide budget support to Bhutan through the proposed Development Policy
Grant in FY06, which will help advance RGoB’s reforms in macroeconomic, fiscal, and public

financial management; private sector development; and education and health. This grant i s expected
to be the first one in a series o f programmatic policy-based operations. In addition, through ongoing
and new investment lending, the Bank Group will continue to support sectors such as education,
urban development, rural development, private sector development, rural roads, and HIV/AIDS
prevention. Historically, IDA financial assistance has been lumpy and irregular. Going forward, the
Bank has agreed to help finance at least one project per fiscal year. IFC will support investments in
tourism and other sectors critical for growth and employment, and through the South Asia Enterprise
Development Facility (SEDF) will help promote the development o f small and medium enterprises.
The program o f analytical and advisory activities (AAA) will aim to be responsive to the country’s
needs and capacity constraints, while striving to remain focused. As such, the CAS includes a
flexible AAA program characterized by a limited number o f formal activities, programmatic nonlending technical assistance in selected areas, and just-in-time AAA to respond to emerging client
demand.
9.
Managing Risks. It i s expected that revenues from hydropower will continue to benefit the
country and that macroeconomic management w i l l remain sound. Political changes are underway,
including a new Constitution and the introduction o f political parties and national elections.
However, the process being followed i s highly participatory, and i s being paced so as to allow for the
development o f national capacity to implement the electoral process and to give people time to adjust
to the changes. Bhutan i s vulnerable to natural hazards such as landslides, and to external shocks
that can have a deep impact on key sectors such as tourism. Economic diversification and adequate
disaster mitigation and preparation should help minimize these risks. Although the situation along
the southern border i s presently stable, the external threat o f separatist groups from India will remain
a concern. Finding a humane solution to the situation o f the people in Nepal claiming Bhutanese
citizenship rights i s an important issue to which RGoB has reiterated i t s full commitment.

Executive Summary

iii

10.
Issues Suggested for Board Discussion: (i)I s the CAS adequately responsive to Bhutan's
unique development vision? (ii)Do the CAS pillars integrate effectively the major areas in support
o f the country attaining its PRSPMDGs targets? (iii) Given the IDA envelope, i s the proposed CAS
program sufficiently selective and realistic? (iv) I s the mix of instruments adequate to maximize
development impact?

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
FOR THE KINGDOM OF BHUTAN
1,
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Bhutan was discussed by the World Bank’s
Board o f Directors in December 1999. The new CAS, covering the period FY06-09, was prepared
following the completion o f the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which was
based on the Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP). On February 8, 2005, the Board discussed the PRSP and
the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN),’ and this document also reflects the guidance provided by the
Board on that occasion. Bhutan became a member o f IFC in December 2003, and this i s the first
CAS jointly prepared by IDA and IFC.
2.
The 9FYPlPRSP i s framed by Bhutan’s unique development vision o f increasing Gross
National Happiness, and reflects the commendable efforts o f the Royal Government o f Bhutan
(RGoB) to improve the well-being o f the Bhutanese despite the challenges imposed by the country’s
mountainous geography and location. In line with the objectives set in the 9FYP/PRSP, the CAS
will focus on helping Bhutan: (i)expand access to better infrastructure and social services, and
connect communities to markets; (ii)promote private sector development and employment; and (iii)
strengthen management o f public resources and monitoring and evaluation o f development
outcomes. To facilitate the achievement o f these ,strategic objectives, the Bank Group will also
provide support to the Royal Government’s crosscutting efforts to promote decentralization, good
governance, and environmental management. Moreover, CAS implementation will emphasize
partnerships with donors active in Bhutan, while promoting the harmonization agenda and capacity
building to increase reliance on national systems.
3.
The CAS period bridges the ninth and tenth five-year plans. Nevertheless, the timing o f the
CAS Progress Report in FY07 w i l l coincide with the completion o f the 9FYP/PRSP, which w i l l
provide an opportunity to adjust, as necessary, the Bank Group’s assistance strategy and program to
possible changes in priorities and country conditions.

I.

COUNTRY OVERVIEW

4.
Bhutan i s a small kingdom covering 38,394 square kilometers in the eastern Himalayas.2
Nestled between China and India, Bhutan started opening to the world relatively recently, especially
through tourism. During this process, the country has experienced rapid social and economic
development as a result o f prudent macroeconomic management, beneficial exploitation o f
hydropower resources, and substantial support from development partners. The country’s
population, officially estimated at 752,700, i s mostly young, rural, and widely scattered across
Bhutan’s rugged terrain.3 Over 42 percent o f Bhutanese are below 15 years o f age and 79 percent
live in the countryside. Nevertheless, urbanization has accelerated, and Thimphu, the Kingdom’s
capital, i s growing fast at around 10 percent per year. Agriculture, the mainstay o f subsistence and
employment, relies on scattered and scarce arable land that amounts to less than 8 percent o f the
country’s territory. N o t surprisingly, land holdings are small and fragmented, and farm

Development Association and the International Monetary Fund, December 2,2004 (Report No. 30716-BT).
Estimates o f the total land area vary depending on the source. The World Development indicators and other international
sources provide somewhat higher estimates than the official figure given above.
Source: 2004 Statistical Yearbook ofBhutan (2005). Population estimates also vary widely. According to UN projections,
for example, Bhutan’s population is about 900,000, The first National Population and Housing Census was conducted in
May 2005 and more reliable data should be available soon.

mechanization quite limited. Dispersion o f the population and the formidable topography, with
elevations ranging from 100 to 7,500 meters, make it difficult to achieve economies o f scale in
service delivery and costly to build and maintain roads and other vital infrastructure. This is made
even more challenging by monsoon floods and landslides in summer and icy conditions in winter.

5.
The same topography, however, provides Bhutan with enormous hydropower potential currently estimated at 30,000 megawatts - in addition to substantial forest resources and biodiversity.
The country has started to exploit hydropower resources in a beneficial manner, mainly with support
from India - i t s largest single donor and trading partner. Indeed, driven by hydropower development
and strong donor support, Bhutan has enjoyed strong economic performance, with GDP growth
averaging over 6 percent a year over the past two decades. Sustained growth has increased Gross
National Income (GNI) per capita to US$770 (2004). While investments in the hydropower sector
have helped accelerate economic growth and social and human development, the country’s reliance
on a single commodity exported to a single market has increased. At the same time, electricity
export revenues have strengthened the role o f the public sector in the economy. In contrast, the
private sector has remained small, and a substantial portion o f the population i s s t i l l engaged in
subsistence agriculture.

6.
During the CAS period, the timing and net impact o f the Tala Hydropower Project (1020
megawatts)-expected to come on stream in 2006-will
be critical for maintaining growth,
sustaining RGoB efforts to expand access to better infrastructure and services, meeting increasing
recurrent costs, and ensuring sound fiscal and debt management. Moreover, fostering private sector
development will be important for boosting economic activity and generating employment
opportunities. Additional factors to take into account include the extent to which the country will
manage to tap into the potential offered by tourism and value-added activities in agriculture, as well
as the evolution o f decentralization and possible decline o f donor assistance. Significant political
changes w i l l take place in the next few years, including the move to a constitutional monarchy when
a new constitution i s adopted and the first national elections. Although the security situation along
the southern border i s stable, the external threat o f separatist groups from India will remain a
concern.

11.

DEVELOPMENT VISION AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

7.
Bhutan’s development has been guided by a homegrown philosophy based on the concept o f
Gross National H a p p i n e s ~ .This
~ concept recognizes that development involves more than economic
progress, and establishes happiness as a legitimate policy concern and maximization o f happiness as
an overarching goal. Accordingly, Bhutan has followed a unique development process that strives to
balance spiritual and material advancement through four pillars: sustainable and equitable economic
growth and development, preservation and sustainable use o f the environment, preservation and
promotion o f cultural heritage, and good governance. This vision and framework has been translated
into sectoral policies, strategies and programs implemented through Bhutan’s five-year development
plans, including the ongoing 9FYP (FY03-07) that constitutes the basis for the country’s first
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
8.
Bhutan’s PRSP aims to galvanize the poverty reduction and development efforts o f the
Royal Government.’ Building on past achievements, the PRSP sets ambitious targets with the
expectation that Bhutan should do even better than it has so far. Specifically, the PRSP reflects the
The country’s development vision and long-term goals are clearly described in Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace.

The PRSP and its related Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) were presented to the Board in February 2005.

country’s development vision and goals, as well as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
through the overall objectives o f the 9FYP: (a) improving the quality o f life and income, especially
o f the poor; (b) ensuring good governance; (c) promoting private sector growth and employment
generation; (d) preserving and promoting cultural heritage and environment conservation; and (e)
achieving rapid economic growth and transformation. To achieve these objectives, RGoB i s
pursuing four interrelated strategies aimed at:
+:*

Maintaining sound macroeconomic policy. The 9FYPPRSP assumes an annual growth
target o f 7 to 9 percent. To achieve and sustain this growth rate, RGoB aims to limit the
current budget deficit to 4-5 percent o f GDP and inflation to around 7-8 percent per annum,
while pursuing an adequate level o f reserves and a sustainable path o f public debt. Private
sector development i s recognized as an important factor for future growth and especially
employment generation.

*:

Ensuring good governance. This strategy i s to be advanced through further implementation
o f political and administrative reforms, including, inter alia, the adoption o f the national
constitution and increased decentralization. The Dzongkhag (district) and Geog (block)6
elected councils are to have the autonomy to make plans, allocate resources mobilized from
their local tax revenues, and frame rules and regulations applicable within their respective
jurisdictions. To enable financial decentralization, the 9FYPPRSP allocates separate
budgets for activities which will be directly formulated, approved, and executed at the
dzongkhag and geog levels. Given the expected changes at various government levels, the
9FYPPRSP also recognizes the need to strengthen the agencies responsible for ensuring
transparency and accountability.

*:

Expanding infrastructure, including roads, electricity and telecommunications, as well as
urban infrastructure and housing. In order to increase rural access to social services and
market opportunities, high priority i s given to improvement and expansion o f the road
network, especially the development o f feeder roads, farm roads, mule tracks, and
suspension bridges. In addition, special attention i s paid to modernizing agriculture and
creating opportunities in agribusiness, horticulture, and small-scale handicraft industries.

*:

Improving access and enhancing social services. Complementing the above expansion, the
9FYPlPRSP also aims at improving access to and enhancing social services, particularly
primary education, primary health care, safe water and sanitation, and other services directly
related to quality o f life and reduction o f poverty.

9.
The JSAN noted that the PRSP provides a basis for addressing Bhutan’s poverty reduction
and development challenges, although the targets for economic growth require further specificity in
relation to priorities and budgeting. The JSAN also commended the participatory planning,
traditionally practiced in the country, which underpinned the 9FYP and PRSP process.’ In this case,
for the first time, communities and their elected representatives prepared plans at the geog (block)
level, and these plans were included under the 9FYP for implementation and monitoring by the
communities themselves. The JSAN also identified three areas that, if strengthened, would facilitate
the implementation o f the poverty reduction strategy. These include (i)strengthening the
macroeconomic framework and policies; (ii)improving public expenditure management; and (iii)
bolstering poverty monitoring and evaluation.

’ The consultative process for the 9FYP lasted over two years, bringing together local communities and their elected

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

10.
There are tradeoffs implicit in the country’s development vision that should be closely
analyzed as part o f the efforts to balance cultural and environmental preservation goals with
acceleration o f economic development and improvement o f the well-being o f all Bhutanese. The
country, for instance, has not fully tapped into the tourism sector’s potential. This sector could be
strategically expanded while still maintaining the cultural and environmental values intrinsic to the
country’s vision. At the same time, the considerable opportunities offered by the forestry sector to
develop the timber industry may need to be weighed against existing restrictions on export and
manufacturing.

A.

Poverty Reduction and Human Development

11.
The 9FYPRRSP notes that poverty, which manifests itself in many dimensions, i s still
widespread in rural areas, and sets improvingquality o f life and income, especially o f the poor, as an
explicit long-term objective. Continued government investment in social and human development
has resulted in measurable improvements in the well-being o f the Bhutanese. However, it i s often
difficult to measure long-term trends and to establish reliable estimates o f key indicators due to lack
o f data, as well as inconsistent definitions and methodologies across some o f the household surveys
that have been conducted thus far. Importantly, despite various initiatives to strengthen poverty
monitoring and evaluation (M&E), survey efforts have been ad hoc and coordination between
agencies remains weak. As noted by the JSAN, statistical systems need to be strengthened, and the
existing data used more effectively to underpin poverty reduction efforts. Respectively, the
challenge posited in the 9FYPRRSP i s to develop a comprehensive definition of poverty that
embraces Bhutan’s development philosophy, values, and unique conditions, while improving
monitoring and evaluation o f development outcomes. An important step in this respect i s the first
National Population and Housing Census, conducted on May 30 and 3 1,2005.

12.
According to the Bhutan Living Standard Survey (BLSS)-the
first o f its kind in the
country-3 1.7 percent o f the population was poor in 2003.8 Moreover, about 11 percent o f the
population would suffer from hunger for two or three months per year. Using the BLSS and
nutrition conversion factors, it i s estimated that about 48.3 percent o f the population, mainly living in
rural areas, were unable to meet their caloric requirement^.^ In terms o f nutrition, iron deficiency
appears to be a problem in Bhutan, often resulting in anemia, while the consumption o f fruits and
vegetables also seems inadequate relative to internationally accepted requirements.

13.
Both poverty and hunger are mostly a rural phenomenon. According to the BLSS, in 2003
the incidence o f poverty was 9 times higher in rural areas than in urban settings (38.3 percent
compared with 4.2 percent). Reflecting the findings o f the Poverty Assessment and Analysis Study
(2000), the 9FYPPRSP identifies the main correlates o f poverty as lack o f road access, inadequate
size o f farmland, food insecurity, lack o f off-farm employment, and limited access to modern
technology. Not surprisingly, the 2003 BLSS shows that poverty tends to be high in remote areas,
where difficult terrain and climatic conditions constrain productivity as well as access to roads,
___

~~

The survey, conducted with support from ADB, is nationally representative, as well as for urban and rural areas. Sampling
however was designed in the absence o f a census. The poverty line was constructed using both food and non-food
components on the basis of consumption needed to meet basic needs. Accordingly, the poverty line was assumed at Nu.
740.35 per person per month (about US$0.53 per day). In addition, deep poverty (estimated at 3.8 percent o f the
population in 2003) i s defined as a total per capita expenditure lower than the food poverty line, which means that the
household cannot afford to buy the assumed minimum 2,124 Kcal per person per day. Based on the BLSS, the Royal
Government prepared in 2004 a report titled Poverty Analysis Report.
This analysis is subject to a number of caveats as the BLSS was not designed for nutrition analysis (see draft Bhutan
Human Development Report, 2005).

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

markets, and basic services. In addition, education has also been found to be an important
determinant of poverty in the country.

14.
Inequality appears comparatively high in Bhutan, but as i s the case with poverty - which i s
likely to have decreased over the last two decades - lack o f data makes it difficult to gauge long-term
trends." Based on the BLSS, the estimated Gini coefficient in 2003 was 0.42 (with 1 representing
perfect inequality)." This trend largely reflects the gap between incomes in urban and rural areas.
There i s a concern, however, that despite concerted government efforts, the poor may not be
benefiting as much from growth as the non-poor. The poor appear to be less mobile, and hence less
likely to go to those places where remunerative jobs are generated and public services are made
available. The poor also have more limited access to credit. In the absence of formal safety nets,
inter-household redistribution i s mostly occurring through remittances, often from urban to rural
areas.

15.
Data constraints also make it difficult to assess Bhutan's social and human development
progress fully, but available figures indicate that in 2003 l i f e expectancy at birth was 66 years, up
from 60 years in 1991, and that population growth has decelerated to around 2.5 percent from about
3.1 percent in 1991. Bhutan has also made significant progress in improving education and health
outcomes. In 1991, official figures showed the gross enrollment rate (GER) in primary education at
55 percent. In 2003, according to the BLSS, the GER has increased to over 92 percent. In part due
to the consistent implementation o f the immunization policy, infant and under-five mortality ratios
have been halved since 1984, and were estimated in 2000 at 60.5 and 84.0 deaths per 1000 live
births, respectively.'* The incidence of stunting and underweight has dropped considerably from
1988 to 1999; stunting among children under five declined from 56.1 percent to 40.0 percent, and
underweight from 38 percent to 18.7 percent.I3 Over the 1980s and 1990s, access to health services
increased dramatically, with at least 89 percent o f the population at present residing within a threehour walking distance from the nearest health center. Given health concerns, in December 2004
Bhutan became the first country in the world to ban the sale of tobacco. Increased access to safe
water and sanitation has paralleled trends in health indicators. BLSS data show that currently about
81.1 percent of the population has access to safe drinking water and 93.5 percent has access to
latrines or toilets. Overall progress notwithstanding, some indicators, such as maternal mortality,
remain at levels comparable to very poor countries, in large part reflecting the tough terrain and
related difficulty in providing access to basic services. Given these conditions, the extensive reach
o f such initiatives as child immunization programs i s remarkable.

Bhutan has also made progress in terms of gender equality, and in general, women enjoy
equal opportunities, entitlements and legal status. However, there are gaps in areas such as higherlevel education and enterprise development. Specific details on progress in achievingthe MDGs are
provided in Attachment 1 (see summary in Table 1 below).

2000 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) i s not comparable to the 2003 BLSS. The HIES was a pilot
effort, based on a provisional and different poverty line than the one used i n the 2003 BLSS, and did not take seasonality
into account.

During 9FYP/PRSP implementation, RGoB i s striving t o continue the prudent
macroeconomic management that has underpinned the country's economic performance.
Specifically, R G o B i s committed t o maintaining government expenditure below 40 percent o f GDP,
reducing the overall budget deficit t o about 4-5 percent of GDP, and financing recurrent expenditures
from domestic revenues. Largely due to revenue volatility and lumpy expenditures, however, the
fiscal deficit has been the equivalent o f 4-10 percent o f GDP in recent years. Despite fiscal cuts, the
overall fiscal deficit (including grants) widened sharply in FY05 as a result o f the purchase o f the
two new planes, reaching 10.5 percent o f GDP this fiscal year, up f r o m 4.7 percent in FY04.15
Importantly, macroeconomic developments in Bhutan are framed by its close economic relations
with India, which i s the country's largest donor, provides budget support in the f o r m o f grants, and
finances major hydropower projects. In addition, Bhutan has a fixed exchange rate with the Indian
rupee (resembling a currency board arrangement) and a free trade agreement (India accounts for
about 90 percent o f Bhutan's foreign trade).
-

I4Creditto the private sector has grown despite high interest rates with spreads between deposit and lending rates ranging
from 3 to 10 percent, partially reflecting rates in India.
I s In FY03, a reduction in the program grant from India contributed to a deficit that reached 10.7 percent o f GDP.

The timing and net impact o f Tala i s critical to Bhutan’s medium-term prospects. Currently,
total electricity generating capacity amounts to 437 megawatts. Tala will bring an additional 1020
megawatts, expanding electricity production by around 230 percent. Moreover, as mentioned above,
when Tala comes on stream, growth will accelerate sharply. In comparison, when the Chukha
hydropower plant was activated during 1986 and 1987, GDP jumped in those years by 12 and 25
percent respectively. In the case o f Tala, although the positive economic impulse w i l l be partially
offset by an associated fall in construction with the completion o f the project, GDP may rise by over
18 percent and the share o f total government revenues accounted for by the hydropower sector will
jump from 30 to 50 percent. On the other hand, the increase in available resources for government
spending due to Tala i t s e l f w i l l be limited by the fact that large repayments o n other hydropower
loans w i l l start at the same time, and the possibility o f less budget support program from the
Government of India (Go]). In addition, the revenues from Tala will depend on the final power tariff
currently under negotiation with India. This, combined with the growing recurrent costs associated
with ongoing investments in health, education, and infrastructure in general, mean that no significant
fiscal surpluses are expected over the medium term.
20.
The hydropower sector will continue to be the major driver o f growth, as it has been for over
the past e o decades. Bhutan has only started to tap into i t s hydropower potential, and in line with its
development vision, plans to continue investing in this sector. In this respect, two new major projects
have already been identified: Punatshangchu (Stage 11,992 MW) and Mangdechu (670 MW). India

8

Bhutan Country Assistance StrategV

has agreed to finance the preparation of detailed project reports, but these will take about two years
to complete, while further analysis i s needed to understand more clearly the implications of these
types of mega-projects for the country’s overall macroeconomic framework.I6 However, as in the
past, these new projects would boost the construction sector and help raise growth. (For further
details on the power sector see Attachment 2). Notwithstanding the risks associated with an
increasing reliance on electricity - an economic activity that presently has a single-market and brings
high dependence on a single-commodity export - power trade may be considered to be a sustainable
“win-win situation” for both countries in the long term given that:
Although construction costs of hydropower projects in India are similar, it i s much easier to
implement power projects in Bhutan since they do not face the more complex
intergovernmental, regulatory, and social and environmental issues that complicate large
power projects in India;
The current deficit and increasing demand for power in India will absorb any power
production in Bhutan, especially when the cost o f power in Bhutan i s less than the marginal
cost of production in India;
By funding the construction of hydropower projects, India i s providing Bhutan with a
permanent stream o f reasonably predictable revenues, which will help mitigate any reduction
in grant support from India; and,
These long-term agreements have mutual benefits and financial flows in each direction,
which provide incentives for a stable economic relationship between both countries.
On the other hand, despite the rapid pace of development underpinned by hydropower
exports, Bhutan remains largely rural, with barter the primary means of exchange in some remote
areas. Agriculture remains an important sector in the economy, but its share o f GDP i s experiencing
a long-term decline. Although the sector currently accounts for about a quarter of GDP, most
agriculture in Bhutan i s still subsistence-based, taking place outside the modern economy. M o s t
significantly, the sector represents the majority of income, employment, and food security for most
Bhutanese, especially for the poorest.” Not surprisingly, once hydropower i s set aside, the country’s
economic’picture changes dramatically, and despite the efforts to provide widespread access to
infrastructure and social services, the income level for most of the rural population remains low.
Given these circumstances, over the medium term, the Royal Government believes that one of its
greatest challenges i s ensuring that growing revenue from hydropower exports i s invested in a
sustainable and equitable manner that does not trigger inflation, distort the economy, induce “Dutch
disease,” or exacerbate income disparities and regional imbalances.
22.
At the same time, expanding productive activities beyond the current mainstay o f public
sector-led.investment and hydropower development will be critical for generating employment and
income opportunities. As detailed below, the 9FYP/PRSP places a renewed emphasis on promoting
the development of a dynamic, competitive, and strong private sector in Bhutan. The private sector,
however, faces difficult challenges such as the small size of the market, entry regulations, lack o f
skilled and unskilled domestic labor, inadequate infrastructure, and disadvantages related to the
country’s location - landlocked and relatively isolated from major markets - and geography, which
contributes to high transportation costs. In general, the private sector needs to grow beyond the
traditional concentration in trading and construction, while labor market practices need to be more

growth and employment i s included in Attachment 3.

C.
Debt Management and Foreign Financing Needs
23.
To achieve the targets o f the ambitious 9FYP/PRSP, RGoB has availed itself increasingly o f
foreign loans. Public debt, internal and external, i s expected to reach about 100 percent o f GDP in
FY05 due to the development o f Tala, the continuing deficits stemming largely from efforts to
expand public services in the rural areas, and the acquisition o f the new airplanes. Indeed, based on
the current level o f debt, Bhutan qualifies for 100 percent grant financing under IDA 14 (see Section
IV-B regarding IDA allocation). External debt consists exclusively o f medium- and long-term
government or government guaranteed borrowings. I t rose to US$530 million at the end of June
2004, or more than 80 percent o f GDP, compared with 42 percent o f GDP in FYOO. The bulk of the
increase i s associated with the development o f Tala, which continues at an annual expense o f almost
10 percent o f GDP per year. The project i s being financed by India, 60 percent in grants and 40
percent in loans at 9 percent interest (repayable over 12 years). The loan portion o f the project now
accounts for almost half o f Bhutan’s external debt stocks, and India i s Bhutan’s largest foreign
creditor. The purchase o f two Airbus passengerjets for DrukAir at the end o f 2004 was financed by
domestic borrowing, raising debt stocks by the equivalent o f US$78 million.
24.
The timing o f Tala and the net impact o f Tala revenues will also be critical for debt
management. Three major hydroelectric power plants - Chhukka (336 MW), Basochu (56 MW),
and Kurichhu (45 MW) - currently account for around 38 percent of government revenue (excluding
grants), and once Tala i s completed this percentage w i l l rise sharply. However, as explained above,
the net impact o f Tala may be smaller than expected because large repayments will commence once
the project i s completed, and Go1 has signaled i t s intention to reduce program grants. The latter i s
critical since grants have been a key part o f the macroeconomic picture o f Bhutan, in some years
exceeding the total import bill. India in particular provided budget support program grants
equivalent to almost 20 percent o f total revenue and grants in FY05, not including financial
assistance for the development o f Tala.
25.
Assuming that revenues from Tala come on stream in FY07, and excluding potential new
power projects financed with additional borrowing, sustainability analyses and stress tests by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank suggest that the debt profile should be
manageable over the medium term (see Attachment 4 for details on public and external debt
dynamics). Although debt has risen sharply in recent years, an important mitigating factor i s that
most o f the country’s external debt i s concessional, and the debt service ratio has risen more slowly
than debt stocks, reaching 5.3 percent in mid-2004 from 4.8 percent in mid-2000. It should be noted
that the Tala project i s not included in the 9FYPERSP or the budget, but these large projects are
included in the debt sustainability analysis and to a limited extent in the fiscal sustainability analysis.
26.
Official medium- and long-term flows o f foreign aid amounted to US$94.5 million,
augmented by US$2.5 million i n foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2003. Foreign donors continue
to provide strong support, financing the development o f hydropower, roads, education, and other key
development investments and programs. FDI i s attracted mainly by the tourism sector, particularly
to the financing o f new hotels and resorts. These trends are likely to have continued in 2004, as
donors, especially the governments o f India and Austria, as well as the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) and the World Bank, continued to disburse at similar levels and helped boost official reserves
to US$391 million in December 2004 - sufficient to cover 18.5 months o f the country’s imports.

D.
Political and Governance Aspects
27.
A process o f political change and decentralization i s fully underway under the leadership o f
His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who has governed Bhutan since 1972 with the support
o f a National Assembly and a Council o f Ministers. Since the late 199Os, the King has increasingly
delegated governing functions to these bodies. The Council o f Ministers, who are elected by the
National Assembly, have been delegated full executive authority since 1998, while the post o f Prime
Minister (who heads the cabinet) i s rotated annually among the five ministers who received the most
votes. Local elections were held recently, and a written constitution, aimed at creating a democratic
political system consistent with the country’s vision, values, and culture, i s almost finalized. A draft
o f the constitution was widely distributed on March 26, 2005.’’ After wide consultation, the draft
Constitution will be adopted and then enacted by the National Assembly. According to the draft
Constitution, the Parliament o f Bhutan will include a National Council and a National Assembly.
The former w i l l consist o f 20 members directly elected by the people and representing each o f the
dzongkhags (districts), and five members nominated by the King. The National Assembly will have
a minimum of 75 members elected by each Dzongkhug according to i t s pop~lation.’~To ensure the
integrity o f the electoral process, political parties, which do not exist at the moment in the country,
would be funded by the Royal Government through an Election Commission.
28.
Decentralization has been advanced to reduce local dependency on the central government
and enhance the voice o f local communities. This effort has been formalized through the creation o f
local development committees at the dzongkhag and geog levels. These committees, whose
members are elected representatives o f the local communities, have been empowered to formulate
plans and make decisions for socioeconomic development programs, and to propose issues for
debate in the National Assembly. Significantly, a process was started in 2002 to transfer financial
powers and responsibilities to local development committees, and budgets earmarked for projects in
each district and block are presently under their purview. The committees have also been
empowered to retain rural taxes and mobilize local financial resources. New revenue sources are
needed, however, as rural taxes account for only a small proportion o f tax revenues.
29.
To promote decentralization, the 9FYPPRSP lays out a three-level implementation process
o f direct relevance to the CAS: (i)central-level programs, such as rural electrification, rural access
roads, rural telecommunications, and human resource development that require large investments,
high levels o f technical expertise, and inter-dzongkhug coordination; (ii)
dzongkhag-level programs,
including programs which require inter-geog coordination, institutional strengthening, and capacity
development; and (iii)geog-level programs to promote social and rural infrastructure development,
covering activities such as, inter alia, irrigation, farm roads, outreach clinics, primary and
community schools, suspension bridges and mule tracks, and rural water supply. Importantly, the
education sector received the largest budget share at the dzongkhug level, and the agriculture sector
the largest share at the geog level. Although geogs are responsible for implementing their own
programs, dzongkhugs are expected to supervise, ensure quality control, and provide technical
support. Finally, a Department o f Local Governance has been established to coordinate and support

‘’The constitution was drafted by a 39-member committee established in November 2001. The committee was chaired by

the Chief Justice, and included members such as, inter alia, the Speaker o f the National Assembly, two representatives o f
the ecclesiastical bodies, and one elected member from each dzongkhag. During the drafting process, the committee
reviewed constitutions from over 50 countries.
l9 The majority of the members of the National Assembly are already directly elected by the local communities they
represent.

the administrative functions o f the dzongkhugs, district development committees (DYT), and block
development committees (GYT).*’

30.
An ongoing challenge for RGoB i s dealing with the Bhutanese citizenship claims o f more
than 100,000 ethnic Nepalese living in camps in eastern Nepal since the early 1990s. According to
RGoB, many o f the people currently in the camps had been living in Bhutan illegally, while others
left voluntarily or have never actually lived in Bhutan. Resolving the issue requires verification o f
claims in an environment that has not always been conducive to a timely and systematic process.
Since October 1993, the governments o f Bhutan and Nepal agreed to verify the people in the camps
according to specific categories: (1) bona fide Bhutanese who may have been forcefully evicted;
(2) Bhutanese who emigrated; (3) non-Bhutanese people; and, (4) Bhutanese who committed
criminal acts. A Joint Verification Team (JVT) consisting o f senior officials from both countries
was established in December 2000. In 2003, Bhutan and Nepal agreed that people belonging to
categories 1, 2, and 4 would be repatriated or resettled according to their respective citizenship
laws.2’ However, an attack on the Bhutanese members o f the JVT in December 2003 during a visit
to one o f the camps adversely affected the verification process. RGoB has expressed concern about
the security o f N T members given the recent increase in the insurgency in Nepal, and the possibility
that the camps could be infiltrated by radical groups. Nevertheless, RGoB has expressed its full
commitment to finding a lasting and durable solution through a bilateral process with Nepal. The
Bank will continue to monitor the progress made, and the concerned UN agencies are providing
needed support to the process.

E.

Environment and Natural Resources

3 1.
The Royal Government has demonstrated a strong commitment to sustainable development,
and the conservation o f biodiversity and the environment. Environmental conservation has been
guided since 1998 by the National Environment Strategy prepared by the National Environmental
Commission (NEC). In 2000, the Environmental Assessment Act was passed to establish procedures
for the assessment o f potential effects o f strategic plans, programs, policies, and projects on the
environment. NEC has since adopted several environmental codes o f best practice for hazardous
waste management, solid waste management, sewage and sanitation, and urban roads and traffic. As
part o f the decentralization process, environmental committees have been established in the 20
dzongkhags o f the country.
32.
Concrete progress has been made through the Bhutan Environmental Trust Fund (BTF).22
One-third. o f the country’s areas have been set aside for conservation purposes, with 26.2 percent
declared protected areas, plus a recent “Gift to the Earth” o f another 9 percent for wildlife corridors
to prevent habitat fragmentation. Under the BFYP/PRSP, the Royal Government i s also engaged in a
concerted effort to develop what it calls the renewable natural resources (RNR) sector, which
comprises crop and livestock production, forestry, farm roads, and natural resource management.
Three-quarters o f Bhutan i s covered in forests, and this sector i s important for the rural poor in terms
of the Geog Ynrgye Tshogchung (GYT) and Dzongkhag Yargye Tshogchung (DYT) Chathrim (Act) has
provided’the legal framework for the ongoing decentralization process. The GYT and D Y T were created i n the early
1990s.
The harmonized position between the two countries states that Bhutan will take full responsibility for those in category 1,
Those in category 2 will be given the option to apply for citizenship in either country, while those in category 4 would be
given the opportunity to prove their innocence in a court of law.
22 The original US$IO million grant to BTF in 1992 was the first environmental endowment by the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) and i s recognized worldwide as an important innovation in donor financing for biodiversity conservation.
The Trust Fund also provides scholarships for two Master’s degrees per year. Co-financing from other donors in addition
to growth in the endowment’s capital brought the Trust Fund’s assets to US$36 million before the market reversal of
2001-2002. The Crown Prince i s now the Chairman o f the Trust Fund.

” The enactment

o f fodder, fuel wood, and building material. Forestry accounts for about 10 percent o f GDP, but its
indirect contribution i s much larger in terms o f the protection and maintenance o f soil and water
regimes (especially given Bhutan’s high reliance on hydro-power).
33.
Although Bhutan has a strong conservation ethic, erosion, deforestation, and overgrazing are
issues o f increasing concern, especially in more densely populated areas. The ongoing process of
decentralization could falter if clear criteria for evaluating tradeoffs between conservation and
development are not developed and agreed upon by communities and government alike. Moreover,
because environmental legislation i s relatively new, the decentralization o f the environmental
management responsibilities from NEC to the line Ministries has only occurred on a limited scale.
A t the same time, the implementation and monitoring o f the policies at the dzongkhug levels are
weak and public information i s limited due to human and capital capacity constraints.

34.
Bhutan faces two central challenges concerning environmental management: ecological
pressure due to rapid urbanization and weak environmental management capacity in the line
Ministries and at the local levels. Emerging ecological pressures from rapid urbanization and
development are posing a threat to the natural environment that will require efforts beyond the
conventional approaches to biodiversity conservation. Bhutan’s rapid urban growth rate i s largely at
the expense o f forested slopes, scarce agricultural land, and wetlands. This degradation trend is
resulting in adverse impacts, with 10 percent o f agricultural land now affected by water erosion,
while localized and seasonal water shortages as well as increased sediment loads in some rivers are
also on the rise. The latter i s a critical issue, especially considering that the country’s
macroeconomic growth prospects are highly dependent on ensuring a reliable supply o f water for the
hydropower sector.
35.
There has been limited experience in the preparation, implementation and monitoring o f
environmental impact assessments (EMS)and environmental management from the line Ministries,
and dzongkag and geog levels. Whereas there has been some effort in building the capacity o f the
technical staff o f each level, extensive development activities are taking place at a much higher rate
than the capacity-building activities. Therefore, there is a need to continue the intensive capacitybuilding activities in environmental management and the preparation, implementation and
monitoring o f the EIAs.

F.

Development Challenges

36.
Accessibility i s t h e defining development issue in Bhutan. Bhutan i s a small, landlocked,
and mountainous country facing structural and geographical constraints and the pressures o f global
competition. The majority o f i t s population lives in small, remote, and scattered rural settlements,
separated by rugged mountainous ranges. The absence o f roads i s a major contributing factor to
poverty. Under these circumstances, greater access through infrastructure expansion i s essential to
improve social services and increase economic opportunities, and consequently, to ensure that
Bhutan continues to make progress toward attaining the MDGs. The country’s road network totals
4,153 kilometers (62 percent paved) and more than 4,300 kilometers o f mule tracks. Yet many
communities remain isolated and dependent on animal and head-load transport. Presently, 50
percent o f the population lives within one hour’s walk from a road, while one-third o f the geogs have
no motorized access. N o t surprisingly, local communities assign a high priority to rural roads and
the upgrading o f mule tracks to allow the passage o f power tillers. Moreover, despite the abundant
supply o f relatively cheap hydroelectric power, 65 percent o f the population lacks electricity.
37.
Expansion and maintenance o f infrastructure and delivery o f social services are costly.
Sectors such as health and education, which RGoB has successfully promoted, demand large
recurrent ’expenditures in order to make full use o f the newly created assets. The country’s

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategv

13

mountainous terrain makes road construction and maintenance immensely challenging. In addition,
road construction in Bhutan i s based, for the most part, on obsolete technology and practices which
affect road quality. As a result, some segments o f the road network are vulnerable to landslides and
flooding, especially during the monsoons, increasing overall routine maintenance costs. In part
because o f these issues, which are critical to the sustainability o f i t s ambitious programs, RGoB i s
finding it increasingly difficult to meet its objective o f financing recurrent expenditures from
domestic revenues.
Need f o r employment generation, particularly for youth. Although s t i l l comparatively
38.
low, the unemployment rate almost doubled between 1998 and 2004, increasing from 1.4 percent to
2.5 percent o f the economically active population. T o a great extent, this trend i s due to the fact that
growth in employment opportunities has lagged relative t o the growing cohorts o f school leavers and
graduates. There i s also a mismatch between the type ofjobs that the educated youth would prefer desk jobs in general, such as in the civil service (historically the main source o f employment) or i n
the corporate sector - and the employment opportunities generated by the economy, especially
manual labor in the nascent private sector. Moreover, while jobs in the civil service are not so
readily available anymore, the private sector’s capacity to generate attractive job opportunities i s still
limited. Simultaneously, due to the changing expectations among the youth, rural-urban migration
and lost o f interest in agriculture has resulted in a growing pool o f job seekers in urban areas and
large towns.
39.
An immediate challenge i s that, presently, a significant proportion o f young men and women
in urban areas have little education, and they face difficulty in finding employment. Three-quarters
o f all urban males between 20 and 25 have not completed primary education, and this group i s far
less likely to find a j o b (relative to those with primary education). Women are also very vulnerable
since their education levels are typically low. According to the BLSS, among urban men aged 2025, 11 percent are unemployed, 25 percent are still enrolled in school or not yet available for the
labor market and only 64 percent are working. Youth unemployment does not necessarily result in
poverty, at least initially, when many young men and women live with their parents. However,
unemployment i s likely to jeopardize the future o f young people as they become heads o f households
or assume some family responsibilities.
40.
Employment generation, particularly for youth, is already a major concern for RGoB. As the
level o f education increases in Bhutan and more children graduate from primary and secondary
school (consistent with the country’s education strategy), the country w i l l need to create more jobs to
absorb them. Youth unemployment, unless addressed, may also create social problems in the
medium to long term, hindering the achievement o f the country’s vision. It i s projected that between
2001 and 2010 approximately 90,000 school leavers and graduates will be produced by the school
system. As the current formal sector workforce i s only 60,000 and a fh-ther 22,000 are in the civil
service or. public institutions, the creation o f an additional 90,000 jobs poses a formidable challenge.
This challenge i s made more difficult by the fact that the private sector relies on foreign workers
while building national capacity. As a result, at the same time that unemployment among nationals
has increased, the number o f work permits for foreign workers has reached 37,000, and in addition,
7,000 to 8,000 foreigners are employed as day workers in towns near the b0rder.2~Considering these
factors, labor policies need to strike a balance between facilitating private sector growth and
maximizing opportunities for generating attractive employment for the Bhutanese. In this respect,
the Ministry of Labor and Human Resources (MoLHR) i s studying the wage structure, employment
practices, and working conditions in the private and corporate sectors.

‘’ In addition, it i s estimated that between 5,000 and 8,000 foreigners are illegally in the country.

41.
Bhutan i s experiencing rapid rates of urbanization, while facing limited availability of
livable and serviced urban land. Between 2000 and 2003, the estimated average annual growth o f
the urban population in Bhutan was over 7.0 percent, and in Thimphu, the Kingdom’s capital, it was
as high as 10 percent. Half o f the country’s population i s expected to live in cities by 2020, making
urbanization and regional development a top national priority. Thimphu, in particular, i s facing
increased demand for residential and commercial space and pressure on existing urban infrastructure.
Solid waste management i s also a growing c0ncern.2~ A major challenge will thus be how to
prioritize future investments in relation to rural and urban areas, especially between Thimphu and
regional towns, and to promote a more balanced regional development process. In general, growthoriented investments in urban infrastructure are needed to allow for urban expansion without
negative effects such as overcrowding and a proliferation o f underserved and slum areas. At the
same time, the capacity o f urban institutions responsible for urban management and infrastructure
services have to be strengthened substantially if cities and towns in Bhutan are to sustain the benefits
o f infrastructure development.
42.
T o increase rural incomes, the challenge for Bhutan will be to diversify and
commercialize within a limited market. Bhutan i s thinly populated but only 7.8 per cent o f the
land i s arable. It has many scattered areas o f fertile soil with generally good water supply, but the
few valleys suitable for agriculture are under increasing competing demand from urbanization. Food
production from the nine traditional crops i s generally sufficient to support an adequate per capita
food consumption level at 2500 kcal, above the South Asian average. However, subsistence
agriculture is relatively extensive and exacerbates land scarcity issues. Land holdings are already
fragmented and small, and farm mechanization i s very limited. Cash crops, particularly h i t and
horticulture, have demonstrated the potential to increase and diversify farm incomes, contributing
not only to food security but also to meeting household needs for cash and intensifying land use.
However, the lack o f roads or airfreight means that agricultural exports will be very limited for a
long time to come. In addition to poor rural access and the loss o f farm land to urban settlement,
constraints to growth include low and declining availability o f farm labor, lack o f financing,
depredation o f crops by wildlife, and a lack o f economic infrastructure to increase value-added in
agriculture.
43.
Private sector growth in Bhutan i s hampered by the small size of the market, the lack
of supportive infrastructure, and the comparatively high costs o f doing business. The World
Bank, in collaboration with the Ministry o f Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Bhutan Chamber o f
Commerce and Industry (BCCI) conducted a Private Sector Survey in 2002. This survey was the
first comprehensive analysis o f private sector issues in Bhutan, and has subsequently helped inform
the 9FYP/PRSP as well as the efforts o f the Bank Group and other development partners. Findings
from the survey and subsequent analysis show that private sector growth i s constrained in Bhutan by
the small size o f the domestic market, high transport costs, and inadequate infrastructure (including
roads, electricity, and telecommunications), regulations, labor market issues and skill shortages,
financing, and a lack o f business development services. Hydropower development has been, and
w i l l remain for the foreseeable future, the major avenue for economic growth. Bhutan’s energy
exporting sector coexists with a small and slowly modernizing non-energy economy. Despite efforts
to strengthen market forces, increase competition, and refocus the role o f the government, the private
sector has remained small and the country remains characterized by a largely subsistence economy.

Introduction o f new consumer products, including a large number o f commodities and especially snack foods sold in

44.
To facilitate a more enabling environment for the private sector, RGoB approved a foreign
direct investment (FDI) policy in December 2002. The tariff structure was simplified in 2002 and
the weighted average tariff rate was lowered to 15 percent. Sales tax and customs duty on a wide
range o f domestic and commercial goods were abolished and the customs duty on spare parts for all
vehicles was reduced from 30 percent to 10 percent. To facilitate import procedures for the private
sector, the authority for issuing import licenses was transferred in July 2002 from the Ministry of
Finance to the Ministry o f Trade and Industry. A business facilitation cell in Bhutan was
inaugurated in November 2002 as part o f the South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation
(SASEC). In 2002, RGoB implemented new prudential regulations and established a Monetary
Operations Committee to formulate and implement policy instruments for a sound financial system.

45.
Enhancing the private sector’s competitiveness -by reducing the costs o f doing business and
improving governance o f the financial sector - are important areas o f the reform agenda being
implemented by RGoB. Specific areas include:

*:

Expanding physical infrastructure. The lack o f agglomeration economies of scale, the
difficulty in obtaining flat land, and the high costs o f infrastructure development, are
major obstacles to industrial development in Bhutan. To address t h i s issue, RGoB i s
planning to develop several industrial estates with reliable, cheap power, and to build a
dry port for trade facilities and services. In addition, India has agreed to explore the
potential o f extending railway links to the Bhutanese border.

*3 Rationalizing entry regulations. As the Bhutan Doing Business Report (World Bank,
2005) indicates, the time taken to register a business in Bhutan i s relatively long.
Specifically, it takes 62 days, with 11 processes, to register a company in Bhutan in
comparison to the South Asian average o f 47 days (global best practice stands at 2 days).
Concerted efforts are being made with support from IFC’s South Asia Enterprise
Development Facility (SEDF) to simplify and automate the registration process.

0 Labor market issues. According to the Doing Business indicators, labor markets are
rigid, adversely impacting employment. Bhutan has the least flexible labor market in
South Asia Region (SAR): on the rigidity o f employment index (which captures the
difficulty o f hiring and firing, the rigidity o f working hours, and the like), Bhutan’s score
i s 49 (the same as Pakistan’s), compared to an average o f 42 for SAR. The cost o f firing
(the cost o f advance notice requirements, severance payments, and penalties) is also one
o f the highest, standing at 94 times the weekly wage (the SAR average stands at 85,
while the country that fares best in the region i s Bangladesh at 47). Cognizant o f this,
. RGoB i s trying to develop more flexible labor laws and employment policies to reduce
constraints for young people (the most affected by stringent labor institutions) in finding
jobs. Specifically, RGoB has drafted an Employment Administration Policy focused on
employment creation and promotion as well as a Labor and Employment Act.
63 Skills shortages. On the supply side, labor shortages o f s k i l l workers are a binding
constraint for industry. In this regard, raising the retention o f children in school through
secondary education; adapting the secondary school curriculum more closely to the
needs o f the private sector; and strengthening vocational education, training, and
entrepreneurship w i l l be critical to raising the availability o f skilled workers. Moreover,
key instruments for assessing labor market skills - such as enterprise surveys and labor
force surveys - need to be strengthened. The Ministry o f Labor and Human Resources
(MoLHR) i s endeavoring to match labor supply and demand through vocational training,

16

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

job counseling, job information, and other programs.25 The challenge w i l l be to ensure
that these programs are effective and do not become too costly or supply-driven,
especially given the mixed results o f such initiatives in other countries.

*:

Developing efsective financial markets and financial instruments. This involves

*:

Reducing trade barriers. In order to benefit from i t s participation in the South Asian
Preferential Trading Arrangement, RGoB needs to rationalize its trade and tariff regime.

developing and strengthening the legal and regulatory framework, standardized
accounting and auditing procedures, efficient payment mechanisms, new non-bank
financial institutions, and market-oriented human resources.

Some efforts to improve trade and transit arrangements with India and Bangladesh and
to negotiate preferential trading arrangements with Nepal and Thailand are underway.

*3 Strengthening Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) architecture and institutional
capacity: Successfully attracting foreign and domestic investment, especially in sectors
beyond tourism, w i l l require continued efforts to strengthen FDI policies and capacity to
promote and facilitate potential investments. FDI rules and regulations are currently
under review and are expected to be approved by the end o f 2005.

46.
While the progress made in raising school enrollment and improving gender parity
attests to the priority accorded t o education by RGoB, the sector faces several challenges.
Bhutan i s committed to achieving the internationally agreed targets for Education for All (EFA) and
Universal Primary Enrollment (UPE). To achieve these targets, RGoB has provided free basic
education covering 11 years from pre-primary to class X, and seeks to address problems affecting
access to and quality o f education, including shortage o f teachers and classrooms, teaching methods,
and poor curriculum. Both the gross enrollment rate (GER) and the net enrollment rate (NER) are
lower for secondary education than for primary education, although these are expected to increase
dramatically given the large cohort o f girls currently at the primary level. Moreover, to make further
progress toward gender parity in education, demand-side measures, such as stipends for girls, may be
needed to offset the direct and indirect costs o f education, particularly at the secondary level. At the
same time, hostels and adequate water and sanitation services, which have a direct impact on girls’
participation in education, should be made more available.
47.
Dealing with the shortage o f teachers i s a critical challenge magnified by the need to build
small schools with a single teacher and multi-grade teaching in order to bring schools closer to
communities. Standing currently at 19 percent, teacher absenteeism at the primary level i s relatively
high. Absenteeism in Bhutan, however, i s mainly related to the shortage o f teachers rather than
teachers not showing up for work (as i s the case in other countries with similar absenteeism rates).
Particularly in rural schools, teachers are usually required to move between classrooms where multigrade teaching i s not being carried out, thus often leaving one or more classrooms without teacher
supervision.
48.
Although teacher qualifications are generally adequate, better teaching methods are needed
to improve overall teacher perfo’rmance in the classroom. Bhutan’s system o f pre- and in-service
teacher education i s comparatively advanced. A Bachelors o f Education i s required to become a
teacher, and regular in-service training i s also mandatory. In addition, teacher salaries are
comparable to other similar cadres in the civil service, which i s helping attract good candidates to the
profession. Nevertheless, an additional effort i s needed to ensure that teachers understand and use
modern teaching methodologies and move away from outmoded rotehead-and-repeat teaching styles.

*’MoLHR is a new ministry, created in 2003 in response to the Royal Government’s concern with labor markets and
employment issues.

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

17

More positively, curriculum reform i s underway with a major thrust on Dzonghku (the national
language), English, and Math.
49.
Tertiary education i s s t i l l in a nascent stage in Bhutan. The GER in tertiary education i s very
low, particularly in the rural areas and among girls. Bhutan traditionally sends i t s brighter students
overseas for higher education, mainly to India, and to a smaller extent to Australia, Canada, and the
United Kingdom, mostly through scholarships offered by these countries. In 2004, the first
university, the Royal University o f Bhutan (RUB), was established by amalgamating several postsecondary colleges spread across the country. This university w i l l need support to increase incountry tertiary-level learning options and to provide an internationally recognized standard o f
education which w i l l allow the Bhutanese to pursue graduate studies elsewhere.
50.
The health sector will need to meet increasing demand for health services, improve
health financing, and develop human resources. Over the past decade, RGoB has succeeded in
expanding the health infrastructure dramatically. The country now confronts new challenges in
increasing utilization o f health services, especially among difficult-to-reach populations. Analysis o f
the BLSS indicates that remoteness i s not the only factor impinging on health-care seeking
behaviors. Lack o f awareness o f the available services and limited knowledge o f prevention and
care are some o f the factors affecting utilization o f public health services. Demand-side
interventions need greater attention and resources to further advance health outcomes.
5 1.
Bhutan provides health services free o f charge to its population. To promote financial
sustainability, RGoB has initiated cost recovery in selected services, and launched the Bhutan Health
Trust Fund in 1998 to help finance essential drugs and vaccines.26 Financial sustainability remains
an increasing challenge given the unfinished agenda related to basic health issues and mounting noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, which require costly treatment and
management. At present, given the lack o f capacity in the country to address these conditions and
diseases, patients are referred, with government financing, to hospitals in India and Thailand. I n
addition, the health sector requires greater management capacity, especially given the ongoing
process o f decentralization.

52.
Though isolated geographically, Bhutan is no longer impervious to HIVIAIDS.
Although Bhutan i s at an early stage o f the epidemic (UNAIDS estimate an HIV prevalence o f 0.01
percent o f the population), it i s experiencing exponential growth o f detected cases. The country also
exhibits many risk factors, such as high rates o f sexually transmitted infections, multiple sexual
partners, commercial sex, and high mobility within and outside the country. In this respect, the
9FYP/PRSP identified HIV/AIDS and STI prevention and control as one o f the country’s most
important programs within the overall objective o f addressing emerging health issues o f the
population at large, and o f promoting healthy outcomes o f women and adolescents.

WORLD BANK GROUP IN BHUTAN - BUILDING ON A STRONG
PARTNERSHIP

53.
The new CAS reflects the findings and lessons from recent country strategy and program
evaluations and discussions, and a series o f consultations carried out by the CAS team in October
2004, March 2005, and June 2005 with the Royal Government, development partners, the private
sector, and other stakeholders (see Attachment 5 for a summary o f the consultations). The specific
Bank documents and inputs include (i)
the Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE), completed by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in June 2004, and the discussion o f the C A E by the
26

About US$18 million have been mobilized thus far for the Health Trust Fund.

18

Bhutan Countty Assistance Strategy

Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE) that took place in September 2004; and (ii)the
CAS Completion Report (included in Attachment 6), which reflects the self-assessment of the
country team based on the CAE, Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs), Quality Assurance
Group (QAG) and OED reviews and assessments, and project supervision documents.

A.

Key Findings

54.
According to the CAE, the overall outcome o f Bank assistance between 1993 and 2003 was
moderately satisfactory. Due to the availability o f grant aid from bilateral donors, the Bank agreed
with RGoB to focus financial assistance on a limited program for infrastructure development for
roads, schools, urban water supply and sanitation, forestry management, and more recently,
HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Commensurate with this limited role, the Bank’s impact was
generally modest. In the case o f the education sector, however, the impact o f Bank assistance was
substantial, while in other sectors, such as forestry, it has had mixed results. Overall, IDA lending
has been largely client-driven and effective as well as sensitive to the country’s culture and
conditions. The Bank provided some useful analytical work and policy advice, but Bhutan did not
benefit as much as it should have from the Bank’s non-lending services.
55.
Co-financing proved to be a useful means to coordinate efforts and maximize the impact of
external resources provided to Bhutan. In general, the Bank coordinated i t s efforts by working with
development partners and following the division o f labor promoted by RGoB. Accordingly, the
Bank supported capital investments while basic capacity building, included under most projects
receiving IDA funds, was usually financed by bilateral partners with grants.
56.
Importantly, the C A E and CAS consultations indicate some “insensitivity to size” on the part
o f the Bank. As in the case o f other small countries, Bhutan’s small civil service could not easily
cope with Bank requirements - and simultaneous demands from other development partners especially for reporting, financial management, and procurement. This situation was exacerbated by
the uneven quality o f project supervision and the difficulty in following up on critical issues, in part
because of the lack o f a local office and staff continuity. Ensuring the latter has always been a
challenge given the small portfolio size. (See the Section on Portfolio Management for more detail
on these issues).

Lessons Learned
As a relatively small player in a small country, the Bank finds itself in a challenging position
in Bhutan, particularly considering the increasing need expressed by RGoB for technical and
financial assistance. Under these circumstances, several lessons should be taken into account:

B.
57.

0 To maximize development impact, Bank assistance needs to emphasize selectivity.
Given the limited IDA and Bank staff resources available, the Bank should limit its
engagement to a few areas and sectors and support these continuously over time.
Q Selectivity should be balanced with flexibility to respond effectively to new client needs
emerging from changing country and global conditions. As OED noted, the Bank has
been most effective when it listened to what the government needed. Responding to
these demands, however, should be carefully balanced with the need to keep Bank
assistance selective and focused.

0 The lending program should be better informed regarding local conditions. As
advised by OED, the Bank should pursue an integrated approach between its lending and
policy advice, with upfront sector work and development o f clear sector strategies.

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

19

*E* Supply-driven assistance, on the other hand, should be avoided, particularly regarding
non-lending services. Going forward, the Bank should undertake a concerted effort to
make government counterparts fully aware of what it has to offer as well as o f the
potential benefits o f certain Bank products. The Bank should also strive to develop and
implement a program o f analytical and advisory services that i s responsive to client
demands.
*:*

Strong donor coordination is required to enhance development effectiveness. The
Bank should not necessarily take the lead in all the sectors it supports, and should be
willing to play a complementary role. Co-financing and other types o f financial
arrangements should be actively sought. To compensate for i t s lack o f field presence,
the Bank should hold program consultations at least once a year and work more closely
with the UN Development Program (UNDP), which leads donor coordination in Bhutan.

0 The Bank should be more sensitive to Bhutan’s capacity constraints. The Bank should
take full advantage o f the ongoing efforts to use country fiduciary and safeguard
systems, and approach “mandated” diagnostic work in a flexible manner by
consolidating tasks when feasible and ensuring client buy-in.

IV.

WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

58.
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) aims to continue helping Bhutan achieve i t s unique
development vision. I t i s selectively aligned with the objectives and priorities o f the 9FYP/PRSP,
while responding to the lessons from and building upon the achievements o f the previous CAS and
the progress review o f the 9FYP/PRSP recently completed by RGoB. Accordingly, the FY06-09
CAS will support Bhutan in (i)expanding access to better infrastructure and social services, and
connecting communities to markets; (ii)promoting private sector development and employment; and
(iii)strengthening management o f public resources, and monitoring and evaluation o f development
outcomes. Pursuing these inter-related strategic objectives or CAS pillars w i l l be facilitated through
across-the-board support to decentralization, good governance, and environmental management.
Simultaneously, Bank Group assistance will be founded upon Bhutan’s all-encompassing effort to
balance priorities related to growth, environment, culture, and governance, which are critical to
maximizing Gross National Happiness.
59.
The above CAS pillars formalize the ongoing strategic shift initiated by the Bank Group to
respond to changing client needs and priorities under the 9FYP/PRSP, and to move beyond the
previous emphasis on knowledge services and balance flexibility and selectivity, in order to enhance
the Bank’s development effectiveness in Bhutan. To maximize impact, assistance w i l l be provided
taking also into consideration the Bank’s comparative advantage and synergies with other
development partners’ efforts. A t the same time, this CAS recognizes that Bank Group support i s
likely to remain modest in relation to the country’s development needs, and aims to catalyze
assistance from other donors while building partnerships around the CAS pillars in order to increase
the impact o f available development resources. (Attachment 7 includes the l i s t o f development
partners by themes or sectors aligned with the 9FYPPRSP.)

60.

Underlying the overall strategic approach, this CAS has a sharper focus on development

results and in helping build the country’s capacity to measure progress in a more systematic and

reliable fashion. Accordingly, in addition to efforts to improve M&E capacity in specific sectors, the
Bank will work with RGoB to complete the set o f baselines for the CAS outcome indicators and

Bhutan Country Assistance Strafe0

20

ensure monitoring o f intermediate indicators and milestones. CAS outcomes are discussed below and
detailed in the CAS Results Matrix (Attachment 8.)

CAS Pillars and Outcomes

CAS Pillar 1 - Expanding Access to Better Infrastructure and Social Services, and Connecting

Communities to Markets

61.
As highlighted in the 9FYP/PRSP and voiced by most local government officials and
community representatives during the CAS consultations, access i s one o f the most critical
challenges for Bhutan. Accordingly, the first CAS pillar focuses on access to quality infrastructure
and services, as well as markets. As discussed below, during the CAS period, the Bank Group will
specifically support efforts by RGoB to expand and improve rural road access, improve quality and
coverage o f urban services in Thimphu and selected towns, promote access to quality education, and
prevent the spread o f HIV/AIDS.

Improving rural access and quality o f road network to connect communities to social
services and markets. Accessibility - a major development issue for Bhutan - depends, to a large
extent, on availability o f appropriate, reliable, and affordable transportation. In fact, given Bhutan’s
geography, poor rural access i s often synonymous with rural isolation and poverty, while high

external and domestic transport costs constitute a difficult challenge to promoting economic
development in general and promising sectors such as tourism, horticulture, ago-processing, and

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

21

wood-based industries in particular. A major country development goal i s to expand the road
network to ensure that by 2020, 75 percent of the rural population will live within half a day’s walk
from the nearest road. Understandingly, the 9FYPPRSP gives a very high priority to investing in the
road network, including national highways, feeder roads, and basic farm roads. To guide these
investments, a comprehensive Road Master Plan has been prepared by RGoB.
63.
The Bank has been supporting the expansion o f rural access through the ongoing Rural
Access Roads Project, which will close in FY06, and plans to continue contributing to this outcome
through a repeater project (US$S.O million) planned for FY07. Through these projects, the Bank
would support infrastructure investments and quality improvement o f the road network, particularly
feeder roads, in selected dzongkhugs and geogs, as well as capacity building for improved road
building technology and practices. With respect to the expected direct impact on the rural
population, initial findings from the socioeconomic impact study conducted for the current roads
project indicate that the new feeder roads have resulted in time savings o f three days for some
communities coupled with a transition from bartering to cash-based exchange and improved access
to services. Further benefits to the population are expected if the next project i s successfully
implemented. Simultaneously, through the existing Decentralized Rural Development Project, which
will also be followed by a repeater project (US$8.0 million) in FY09, assistance will be provided to
help connect farmers to services and markets in targeted geogs through the provision o f farm roads
and bridges, as well as upgrading of mule tracks to permit the passage of power tillers. All of these
efforts will build upon recently completed analytical work, including a Transport Sector Note
(FY04), and ongoing programmatic technical assistance to strengthen the management o f public
resources, including the piloting o f multi-year budgets in the road sub-sector (Department o f Roads),
among others (see CAS Pillar 3 below.)

64.
Support to the road sector by the World Bank has so far complemented other development
partners’ efforts. Going forward, coordination will be further intensified and formalized to the extent
possible. While the Bank Group has focused on financing the expansion of rural access through
feeder roads, ADB has been involved in helping strengthen the national highway system. Given the
substantial financing need, ADB also plans to support construction o f feeder roads in the future. In
terms o f capacity building, ADB has focused on road safety and asset management, while the Bank
together with the Netherlands Development Organization ( S N V ) - as noted below - have promoted
and will continue to support the use o f the environmentally friendly road construction (EFRC)
methods developed under the existing road project as well as building capacity for contract
management.
65.
Increasing access to adequate urban services in Thimphu and selected towns. As
mentioned above, Bhutan i s experiencing rapid urbanization, which i s increasing pressure on
Thimphu and Phuentsholing- the country’s two main cities - and many large towns. I n response to
this challenge, the 9FYP/PRSP emphasizes promoting balanced regional development and a good
quality o f urban life in the country. The 9FYPPRSP also recognizes that, to meet these goals,
Bhutan will need to develop a well-governed and strong system of local governments by, inter alia,
continuing to advance the decentralization process. As a critical step, the Bank will help RGoB
prepare a National Urban Strategy that will also include a City Development Strategy for Thimph~.~’
The objective of this activity i s to develop a strategy and action plan responsive to the country’s
culture and values, which will help manage urban growth efficiently and equitably and, at the same
time, promote balanced regional growth. I n addition, the strategy will help draw up municipal
financing plans. As i s the traditional practice in Bhutan, the strategy will be prepared following

*’Most o f the funding for this activity will come from the Cities Alliance. The United Nations Environmental Program
(UNEP) and the World Bank will also provide some funds.

22

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

extensive consultations among key stakeholders. To complement this effort, analytical work on
decentralization, particularly fiscal issues, i s also planned.
66.
Simultaneously, the Bank w i l l help finance urban infrastructure and expansion o f serviced
land, as well as support capacity building for urban management. The ongoing Urban Development
Project, approved in FYOO, has assisted in improving urban infrastructure and services in 10 towns,
and has built capacity for operation and maintenance (O&M) and cost recovery. Building upon the
National Urban Strategy, the second Urban Development Project (FYO8, IDA US$lO million) will
target Thimphu and possibly a few additional towns to promote balanced regional development. For
the most part, however, the project would help develop outlying areas o f Thimphu to help deal with
the increased demand for residential and business accommodations and the intensifying pressure on
the city’s infrastructure and overall urban environment. In preparation, the Thimphu City
Corporation (TCC) and RGoB have developed a comprehensive structural plan and identified 10
areas (or new townships) for expansion o f the city, while taking important steps to strengthen the
legal and institutional framework o f the urban sector. I t i s noted that implementation o f the urban
development project in Thimphu w i l l not start until FY08, so the impact o f Bank assistance w i l l not
be fully measurable during the CAS period.

67.
Bank Group assistance w i l l be closely coordinated with ADB and the Danish International
Development Assistance (DANIDA), which have been very active in the urban sector. ADB has
been financing infrastructure investments in Thimphu and Phuentsholing, and providing technical
assistance related to urban and housing sector issues. DANIDA has supported urban environment
improvement in both cities. Moreover, ADB and DANIDA have been assisting RGoB in activities
that will enhance the impact o f Bank assistance, such as streamlining o f land registration procedures,
revising government housing and land administration, promoting housing finance, and increasing the
efficient use o f existing serviced land. Given the large financing needs in the sector, RGoB has also
requested ADB to support Thimphu’s expansion, in addition to financing investments in
Phuentsholing and Dagana.** T o ensure good coordination, it has been proposed that out o f the
city’s I O new areas, ADB w i l l finance investments in the five southern areas and the World Bank in
the five northern areas. At the same time, ADB w i l l support the preparation o f the study o f baseline
conditions in all the 10 areas, including demographic information and infrastructure needs, among
other issues. During project preparation, ADB and World Bank w i l l agree with RGoB on ways to
harmonize reporting mechanisms o f the two projects. ADB and the World Bank would also
coordinate among themselves and with other donors on technical assistance to be provided under
each project to promote further changes in the legal and institutional framework o f the urban and
housing sector.
68.
Improving access to and quality o f education. Through i t s support since 1988, the Bank
has successfully contributed to the good progress on educational outcomes made by Bhutan.
Beginning with support for primary education, the Bank has progressively extended i t s assistance to
secondary education, for the most part in partnership with the Swiss Development Corporation
(SDC). The most recent project, the Education Development Project (EDP), for which IDA provided
US3 1 million through the largest credit ever given to Bhutan, extends support to middle and higher
education on the basis o f the sector development strategy underpinning the 9FYPBRSP. In addition
to helping expand and improve educational facilities, the Bank will contribute to increasing the
availability o f teachers, the effectiveness o f teaching and learning, encouraging innovative
approaches by schools to deal with specific issues affecting student performance, introducing

**

TCC estimates that about US$120 million are required to develop the 10 new areas in Thimphu alone. As such,
infrastructure investments will have to be phased out depending on availability o f resources. ADB has confirmed that it
plans to provide US30 million under its next urban development project.

information technology (IT) in secondary schools, and creating the Secretariat o f the Royal
University o f Bhutan (RUB). To help establish RUB, the Bank would also provide technical
assistance and potentially financial support in FY09.
69.
Through the EDP, the Bank will also support the introduction in Bhutan o f a new technology
for school ,construction based on light gauge construction framing (LGCF). Externally, the new
schools will be respectful o f the country’s architecture, but unlike traditional construction methods,
this new technology will not be constrained by timber and expatriate labor shortages that affected the
pace o f expansion o f education facilities in the past. Introduction o f the new technology w i l l also
contribute to the development o f the country’s knowledge and skills base, as a good number o f
workers, site supervisors, engineers, and other technical personnel will have to be trained. It i s also
likely that, in the medium term, this technology could have a wider application throughout Bhutan.

70.
The Bank has been one o f the largest donors in the sector, and plans to continue supporting it
to help the country meet its M D G targets and deal with critical constraints to improving access to
and quality o f education. This assistance would complement the efforts o f other development
partners such as Denmark, Canada, India, Switzerland, Japan, and UNICEF. While most o f these
donors finance specific projects, India and Denmark have been providing budget support to the
sector (although Denmark provides 80 percent as budget support and the rest for technical assistance
projects.) As detailed below, the Bank will, for the first time, provide budget support in FY06
through programmatic, broad-based development policy lending (initially through an IDA Grant
rather than Credit). Although the budget support w i l l not be sector-specific, the operation Development Policy Grant I(US$l5 million) - w i l l include policy actions undertaken by RGoB in
the education and health sectors that will result in better budget planning and management, access
and quality o f service delivery, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) o f human development
outcomes.

7 1.
Changing risky behaviors and improving treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections
(STIs) to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. As noted above, although Bhutan i s at an early stage
o f the epidemic, the 9FYP/PRSP identified HIV/AIDS and STI prevention and control as one o f the
country’s most important programs.
72.
The World Bank has not traditionally been involved in the health sector in Bhutan, with the
exception o f its support to the ongoing effort by the Royal Government to prevent the spread of
HIV/AIDS. Specifically, the Bank Group i s contributing to this outcome by supporting the
HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention Project, financed through an IDA Grant (US$5.8 million) approved
in FY04. This project i s helping (i)expand HIV and STI prevention interventions, especially for
populations at higher risk and in high transmission areas; (ii)initiate care and treatment for people
living with HIVIAIDS (PLWHA); (iii)improve human resources through long-term and short-term
training and country exchanges; (iv) improve management and technical capacity o f dzongkhags,
line ministries, and civil society organizations to undertake HIV/AIDS prevention; (v) strengthen
surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, and information systems for better decision making on
policies and programs; and (vi) engage community-based organizations, NGOs, local governments,
and multi-sectoral agencies at the district level in HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. During the
preparation o f the project, RGoB revitalized the National AIDS Commission (a multi-sectoral
coordinating body), and prior to project launch, the King issued an edict to protect the Bhutanese
living with HIVIAIDS from stigmatization and discrimination.
73.

IDA assistance complements the larger efforts to health sector development provided by Go1

- the largest donor to the health sector - and DANIDA, which has been supporting the health sector

since 1990. Moreover, it complements specific support for HIV/AIDS prevention from UN agencies

24

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

such as UNICEF and WHO. Currently, the financing gap in the health sector i s small, with DANIDA
expected to continue providing budget support to the sector while IDA financing o f HIV/AIDS and
STI prevention i s expected to continue during the CAS period. However, if resources are not
available from other sources, the Bank may consider a follow-on operation.

CAS Pillar 2 - Promoting Private Sector Development and Employment

.

74.
To ensure the twin goals o f rapid growth and employment generation for youth, the
9FYP/PRSP places a high priority on the development o f the private sector, whose potential remains,
for the most part, untapped. However, policy and regulatory changes are urgently needed in order
for the private sector to play an effective role in generating employment. Among the various sectors,
agriculture i s s t i l l the mainstay of rural employment, and as such received focused attention in the
9FYP/PRSP. In line with these priorities, the Bank Group will help Bhutan reduce critical constraints
to private sector development and increase agricultural productivity and diversification. These CAS
outcomes are discussed below.

targeted geogs
20-30% increase in cash crops from baseline for targeted geogs

Increased adoption of crop varieties by targeted households

75.
Reducing selected critical constraints to private sector development. The Bank Group
has been helping promote private sector growth through i t s support to expand and improve
education, rural access, and urban development. It has also provided technical assistance in various
key areas ‘such as the development o f legislation for foreign direct investment (FDI), promotion o f
small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and capacity building to the Bhutan Chamber o f Commerce
and Industry (BCCI). Analytical support has been provided through the Private Sector Survey
(2002) mentioned above, and the Doing Business Report (2005). Finally, shortly after Bhutan
became an IFC member in December 2003, IFC approved a US$10 million investment in the tourism
sector.
76.
Under this CAS, the Bank Group will engage in a concerted effort to help reduce some o f
the critical constraints faced by the private sector in Bhutan. Accordingly, building on t h e Private
Sector Survey and subsequent work, IDA and IFC will collaborate with the Foreign Investment
Advisory Service (FIAS) to provide crosscutting support to help improve the country’s overall
business environment, while providing focused assistance to potential growth and employment
generation sectors such as tourism, SMEs, and agribusiness development.

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

25

77.
Importantly, during the CAS period, the reform agenda related to private sector development
w i l l be supported through the Development Policy Grant I(FY06), and most likely, through a second
policy-based operation in FYOI. Some o f the medium-term policy and reform efforts to be
supported through development policy-based financial assistance would potentially include the
implementation o f flexible labor laws and employment policies; preparation and initial
implementation o f a comprehensive private sector development strategy, which would be an integral
part o f the next five- year plan I PRSP; establishment of an efficient system for business registration;
and changes to the pricing structure o f the tourism sector. The Bank’s policy support would
complement ADB’s plans to provide follow-on technical assistance to MoLHR to help, among other
issues, make the Labor and Employment Act operational.
78.
To help address other key constraints identified in the 9FYPPRSP’ the Bank will help
finance a Private Sector Development Project (US$8.0 million) in FY07. This operation would
contribute to infrastructure development for selected industrial estates and a Distance Learning
Center / ICT Park (provided that the feasibility studies support these investments); institutional and
policy support to government agencies dealing with private sector development; capacity building to
strengthen the advocacy role o f private sector associations; and promotion o f financing mechanisms
to foster private sector activities. Activities under this project would be closely coordinated with
ADB, IFC, and the South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF).

79.
In terms of analytical and advisory services, the Bank plans to continue preparing the yearly
Doing Business Report for Bhutan, and will help conduct a Youth Employment and Labor Market
Study in FY07 followed by a new Private Sector I Investment Climate Assessment in FY08. The
Doing Business Report will monitor indicators that can be compared across counties, and cover
fundamental aspects o f the life cycle o f private firms. The Private Sector Survey / I C A would help
measure progress, identify lessons learned, and suggest policy and strategic adjustments regarding
private sector development.
These activities would contribute to the preparation o f the
1OFYPPRSP, and complement the investment climate work planned by SEDF.
80.
The South Asia Enterprise Development Facility, located in Dhaka, has been active in
Bhutan since 2003, primarily focusing on access to finance and improving the overall enabling
environment for SMEs. As per i t s mandate, SEDF will continue to provide technical assistance in
support o f SME development. Among other activities, SEDF has been providing technical assistance
under the Business Enabling Environment Program. This effort has included a review o f the legal
and regulatory environment relevant to the private sector and the establishment o f BCCI’s
Knowledge Center, a “one stop shop” for local SMEs and services providers for business resources
and training. To facilitate access to finance, SEDF w i l l continue to help improve the capacity o f
financial institutions in Bhutan t o cater to the needs o f local SMEs through provision o f training
programs targeted at local financial institutions in coordination with the Royal Monetary Authority
( M A ) and technical assistance to financial institutions. SEDF w i l l also continue to help promote
the introduction o f new financial products for SMEs, such as leasing and factoring. This effort will
be closely coordinated with ADB’s overall support to the financial sector.
81.
The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) w i l l continue to provide support to the
Royal Government’s efforts to develop and implement their FDI legislation and to facilitate domestic
investmerit. The proposed Institutional Development and Capacity Building Project, to be supported
by FIAS, will aim to strengthen the capacity o f RGoB to support investment promotion for both
foreign and domestic firms, and to build, promote, and measure linkages o f FDI with SMEs. This
work w i l l also include sector-specific analysis to be defined in conjunction with RGoB and the
private sector. MIGA training for investment promotion staff and for development o f an investortracking database may be included with these activities.

26

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

82.
Increasing agricultural productivity and diversification in selected geogs. Although the
agriculture sector’s contribution to GDP has decreased over the years to about one-quarter of the
total, it i s s t i l l the main source o f income and employment for the majority o f the Bhutanese. At the
same time, poverty in Bhutan i s overwhelmingly rural. To reduce rural poverty, the 9FYPPRSP
aims at increasing rural income and employment, in addition to improving food security and
promoting sustainable natural resource management. This also has gender implications given that
women are the primary producers in Bhutan’s agriculture sector since two-thirds of them are
employed in the sector and 70 percent own land. To achieve this long-term goal, agricultural output
needs to be increased and diversified at the same time that access to markets i s improved. Given
these considerations, the 9FYP/PRSP identifies the renewable natural resources (RNR) sector as
critical, and defines this sector comprehensively as comprising o f crop and livestock production,
farm roads, forestry, and natural resource management.

83.
The Bank Group will be assistingthe RNR sector directly through the existing IDA-financed
Decentralized Rural Development Project (US$7.0 million), and a follow-on project (US$S.O
million) in FY09. Through these and other projects (see support to crosscutting issues below), as
well as through analytical and advisory services, the Bank will also support decentralization and
natural resource management. Specifically, in addition to facilitating access through feeder and farm
roads (see CAS Pillar l),
IDA would support investments in other rural infrastructure, including
irrigation channels and RNR centers, and agricultural extension services in selected dzongkhugs to
provide training in agricultural production and marketing. Irrigated agriculture has been identified as
an important source o f growth and food security, while RNR centers are envisaged as the frontline
institution in the effort to improve productivity and sustainability o f crop, livestock, and forest
production. As such, RNR centers will provide opportunities for farmers, assisted by geog-based
extension staff, to take advantage of productivity and income gains through joint experimentation,
knowledge sharing, and capacity building. I n parallel, the Bank group will help promote
agribusiness, considered a priority export sector in Bhutan. SEDF, in particular, will help implement
a pilot project under a capacity building program with the National Women’s Association of Bhutan
(NWAB). This pilot project, which may be eventually scaled up across the country, will help rural
women cultivate and market medicinal herbs. I n the medium term, all these efforts should result in
wider adoption o f improved farm technologies and varieties at the household level, better
agricultural extension services, and employment opportunities in the rural areas for school leavers,
and in the longer term, increased food security and rural incomes.

84.

Through the DecentralizedRural Development Project, IDA i s supporting investments in six
focal dzongkhugs where there has been little, if any, donor activity in the past. At the same time, the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) i s providing support in other hongkhgs in
a similar fashion. In general, the proposed CAS program i s complemented by ADB assistance to
expand rural electrification and promote micro-credit development, as well as ongoing and planned
efforts by the EC, UNDP and WFP to support the RNR sector, and Bhutan and India’s agreement to
cooperate in agriculture and allied sectors.
CAS Pillar 3 - Strengthening Management of Public Resources, and Monitoring and
Evaluation of Development Outcomes

85.
As emphasized in the JSAN of the 9FYPPRSP, Bhutan should (i)strengthen the
macroeconomic framework and policies; (ii)improve public expenditure management; and (iii)
bolster poverty monitoring and evaluation. With the expected substantial increase in revenue from
hydropower exports, improving controls, planning and execution procedures, and transparency and
accountability should be given a high priority. Increased public investment w i l l also make more
urgent the need to tackle the limited capacity for measuring development results. As detailed below,

27

the Bank plans to assist in these related priorities, taking into consideration the valuable support
being provided or planned by development partners.

86.
Improving budget management and public financial management. A well-functioning
public resource management system i s especially important in Bhutan, where, as per the country’s
vision, the government i s committed to ensuring equitable and sustainable growth, and the public
sector plays a major role in the evolution o f the economy. Given capacity constraints, public
resources are managed reasonably well in Bhutan, though significant issues need to be addressed,
including weak links between the five-year plan / PRSP and the annual budgeting process. Ensuring
the maximum development impact o f expenditures from the increasing revenues from hydropower
exports will require enhanced fiscal discipline and allocative and technical efficiency. Moreover, the
ongoing process of political and administrative decentralization has led to a paradigm shift in the
planning and implementation o f development activities, heightening the need for greater
transparency and accountability, as well as increased capacity at the dzonghhwg and geog levels. The
Royal Government needs to improve the accuracy and consistency o f macroeconomic forecasting to
help underpin sound revenue projections and inform policymaking. Progress in this area will depend
on enhancing coordination between government departments and agencies that produce inputs for
macroeconomic and revenue forecasts, and on strengthening revenue forecasting capacity.

87.
In recent years, RGoB has taken several important reform steps, including revising the
Budget Manual in 2001 to call for the introduction o f multi-year rolling budgets. As recommended
in the JSAN, RGoB has also initiated the process o f establishing a Medium Term Fiscal Framework
(MTFF) as a first step towards implementing multi-year rolling budgets (MYRB, more commonly
known as a Medium Term Expenditure Framework in other countries). Recognizing the need for
improved coordination, RGoB plans to establish a Macroeconomic Framework Coordination
Committee (MFCC) whose primary responsibility will be to draw together inputs from across the
various concerned agencies, and to prepare a coherent set o f macroeconomic projections. These
would then be used to underpin revenue projections, and define a more realistic resource envelope.
Simultaneously, RGoB will continue its efforts to improve debt management systems. To ensure

28

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

that these efforts have a measurable impact, RGoB i s also endeavoring to increase statistical capacity
and data availability.

88.
Public financial management (PFM) has been improved through concrete actions such as the
establishment o f internal audit units in each line ministry and by separating aid management from
budget and accounts. External audits are conduced periodically by the Royal Audit Authority
(RAA), which has considerable independence in practice, although not formally.
These
improvements notwithstanding, Bhutan’s national systems require further strengthening to build
capacity o f the accountability and oversight institutions, meet the P F M and transparency demands
arising from the increased revenues and levels o f government spending in the coming years, and
ensure that the decentralized institutions have the capacity and practices to fulfill their PFM roles.
More specifically, timeliness o f accounting and reporting remains an issue, despite the introduction
o f a Budget Accounting System for generating reports. This, in turn, affects monitoring and
evaluation o f reports, making it more difficult to undertake timely corrective measures. A
substantial gap exists between accounting practice in the country and international standards, and the
country s t i l l needs to develop a domestic cadre o f accountants and auditors. The w o r k o f the internal
auditors deputed to the line ministries remains for the most part ad hoc since they have not been
given clear terms o f reference. Due to financial and manpower constraints, RAA cannot always
audit every agency once every two years as mandated.
89.
The Royal Government has recognized the importance o f improving procurement outcomes,
given their relevance to the overall effort to strengthen public expenditure management.
Nevertheless, increased capacity to manage and undertake procurement, which i s critical for efficient
decentralization and the promotion o f good governance, i s still needed. Procurement and
management o f assets need to be more effective, and procedures to review and supervise high-value,
high-risk procurement should be developed. Progress has certainly been made with support from
donors, including ADB. Most rules relating to procurement were revised and updated in the
Financial Manual published in 1998, and an Arbitration law drafted and discussed in 2000. The
recently drafted Financial Management Law contains further revisions o f rules applicable to
procurement. Moreover, technical assistance financed by ADB has helped Bhutan streamline rules
and regulations, prepare model bidding documents, and establish a registration and classification
system f o i contractors.

90.
I n response to the above needs and priorities, the Bank Group w i l l support RGoB’s
interrelated reform efforts to improve macroeconomic forecasting, budget management, and the
overall public financial management (PFM) framework through the Development Policy Grant I
(FY06) and a potential subsequent operation (FY08). Implementation o f the reform agenda w i l l be
supported by technical assistance provided through IDF grants. These include, first, a new initiative
to strengthen public expenditure management and promote transparency (US$300,000) approved at
the end o f FY05. This initiative w i l l help RGoB develop and progressively strengthen the MTFF
and move towards making MYRB operational, bolster the institutional linkages needed for better
macroeconomic framework coordination and the preparation o f macroeconomic forecasts, build
capacity for revenue forecasting within an MTFF, and enhance transparency. Second, an existing
activity, based on the findings o f the Country Financial Accountabiliv Assessment (2002) i s
supporting (i)the drafting o f the National Finance Act; (ii)the establishment o f a training and
certification program to build capacity for finance, accounting, internal audit, and management staff
in the National Finance Service; and (iii)building capacity in the Department o f Budget and
Accounts to implement budget reforms, as well as in the Royal Institute o f Management to improve
training.

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

29

91.
As detailed in the country program, the Bank w i l l also support this CAS outcome through
analytical and advisory services to increase the understanding o f macroeconomic issues, particularly
those related to sources o f growth (FY07), while programmatic non-lending technical assistance
(TA) on public expenditure management would continue through the CAS period. Further assistance
in preparing the MTFF i s expected to help (i)improve overall resource predictability over time; (ii)
enhance budget transparency; and (iii)minimize the need for ad hoc budget-cutting exercises. In
addition, the Bank w i l l conduct a comparative analysis of public sector accounting and auditing visa-vis international standards (GAP analysis) that w i l l help RGoB outline a path for bringing
Bhutanese standards closer to internationally accepted ones. It i s expected that further progress
during the CAS period to broaden and deepen accounting and auditing procedures, practices, and
skills will help strengthen the overall public financial management (PFM) framework and the
transparency o f budget execution, as well as improve the accuracy and timeliness o f national and
sub-national financial reporting and the internal control environment.
92.
These efforts w i l l be guided by the overarching need to increase local and national capacity
for financial management and procurement so that development partners can rely increasingly on
country systems and make progress on the harmonization agenda. Accordingly, World Bank support
will build upon assistance provided by other development partners, including UNDP, IMF, and
ADB. UNDP has provided capacity building for improved public expenditure management, while
IMF has deepened its dialogue on macroeconomic issues with RGoB through Article I V
consultations and related technical assistance activities, especially on tax policy. ADB assistance has
helped improve efficiency in day-to-day operations through the computerization o f the budget and
accounting system, as well as on procurement.
93.
Improving capacity f o r monitoring and assessment of development outcomes. The
9FYPPRSP recognizes that poverty monitoring and evaluation and assessment o f development
outcomes need to be strengthened. Respectively, the JSAN noted several institutional issues that
should be addressed: The mandate o f the National Statistical Bureau (NSB) as the central agency for
compiling statistics i s weak in the absence o f a statistics law and o f a statistical master plan. The
latter should be prepared in coordination with the proposed Poverty Monitoring and Assessment
System (PMAS) to be managed by the Poverty Monitoring Unit under the Department o f Planning.
Moreover, RGoB should develop a clear set o f targets and indicators, aligned with the PRSP and
MDG targets, and built consensus around these among key stakeholders. The coordination o f future
survey work should also be improved. It i s critical that different surveys be comparable for
government agencies to be able to monitor progress on development outcomes over time, and
conduct impact evaluations. Finally, the reporting frameworks at the dzongkhag level should be
consolidated.
94.
The Royal Government, with support from development partners, has undertaken several
initiatives to strengthen poverty monitoring and evaluation, including the Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (2000), the pilot Bhutan Poverty Assessment and Analysis (2000), the Bhutan
Poverty Monitoring and Assessment System Framework Document (2003), the Bhutan Living
Standards Survey 2003 (BLSS), and most recently, the Poverty Analysis Report (August 2004, based
on the BLSS). More crucially, as noted above, the first National Population and Housing Census
was conducted this year following international standards, and data processing and analysis are
underway.

95.
Development partners have provided substantial assistance to RGoB in its efforts to improve
statistical systems. ADB has a multi-year statistical capacity building TA program supporting (i)the
drafting o f the statistics law; (ii)the improvement o f the national accounts; (iii)the design,
implementation and analysis o f the household income and expenditure survey in 2000;

30

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

(iv) expansion o f data collection and dissemination; and (v) the upgrading o f statistical capacity. A
follow-up TA program was agreed in November 2004 to help build the effectiveness o f the National
Statistical Bureau (NSB) and the Statistical Board, improve the completion o f the national income
accounts and strengthen the technical skills o f NSB staff. Simultaneously, the UN agencies have
provided various forms o f support, including development o f the Poverty Monitoring and
Assessment System (PMAS), the census, and the M&E systems in various sectors. Bilateral donors
have also provided assistance within the sectors that they have been supporting. For instance,
DANIDA has a strong engagement with the Ministry o f Health on M&E for improved health
outcomes. Traditionally, the Bank Group has been less engaged in this area, focusing mainly on
strengthening M&E capacity o f the sectors where it has been involved, especially the education
sector.

96.
Going forward, the Bank w i l l broaden its assistance in close coordination or direct
collaboration with development partners. Areas for support include a potential grant from the Trust
Fund for Statistical Capacity Building to help prepare the statistical master plan; programmatic
technical assistance on specific statistical issues, including poverty M&E linked with a focused effort
in health and education MDGs; and enhanced capacity building at the sectoral level through IDAfinanced projects.
Crosscutting Support t o Decentralization, Good Governance and Environmental Management
97.
A key challenge for RGoB i s to make decentralization happen, particularly at the geog level.
Two major challenges are the need for increased coordination across various government levels, and
for stronger capacity at the local and community levels. Environmental conservation and natural
resource management underpin most development efforts in Bhutan, and building on their successes
requires more capacity at the center, and most critically, at the sectoral and local levels.
Decentralization, good governance and environmental management involve crosscutting efforts, and
the Bank will selectively support these during the CAS period, focusing on efforts that would have
the greatest impact and that are critical to achieving the three strategic objectives or pillar o f this
CAS.
Longer-term Country Development

98.
Promoting decentralization and good governance. During the CAS period, the Bank
would help promote decentralization through coordinated assistance across sectors (i.e,, in education
and rural development), building on the efforts described in Pillar 3 related to improved public
resource management. For instance, the renewable natural resources (RNR) sector strategy,
supported by IDA through the Decentralized Rural Development Project, i s being implemented
within the context of, and in support o f decentralization and the empowerment o f local communities.
Specifically, this project will provide capacity building at the local level to improve financial
management and accounting, engineering skills for design and supervision o f rural infrastructure,
operational capacity for water user associations ( W A S ) , and implementation o f environmental and
social safeguards. A t the same time, the Bank w i l l support decentralization o f school management
through the existing Education Development Project. In particular, leadership and management
training w i l l be provided at the dzongkhag level to the district education officers.

99.
Increasing environmental management capacity at the national, sector, and local levels.
Capacity building in environmental management i s an inherent part o f World Bank assistance in
Bhutan. Generally, IDA-financed projects aim at building capacity in the concerned line ministry,
dzongkhags, and geogs to carry out their environmental management and monitoring responsibilities.
More specifically, the Bank has supported, and will continue to promote, the mainstreaming o f
environmentally friendly road construction (EFRC) techniques developed with support from I D A
and The Netherlands. Evidence suggests that compliance with EFRC minimizes environmental
management requirements and decreases road maintenance costs substantially, although it increases
upfront investment costs. The Bank w i l l also help promote environmentally sound management
(including treatment and disposal) o f biomedical waste under the HIVIAIDS Prevention Project.

100. Complementing IDA efforts, a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) - with
parallel financing from DANIDA - w i l l help promote sustainable land management practices.
Specifically, the proposed Sustainable Land Management Project (US$7.9 million), to be approved
in FY06, would foster approaches, tools, and interventions to reverse damage t o land due to weak
policies, overgrazing, forest degradation, and unsustainable agricultural practices. This effort would
help broaden the sources o f livelihood and well-being of selected local communities in Bhutan.
Among other activities, the project will provide bottom-up participatory planning, and through pilot
sites will provide lessons to formulate policies and revise the regulatory framework to facilitate intersectoral and decentralized sustainable land management.

Proposed Assistance Program

101.
In addition to the proposed investment projects, RGoB has for the first time requested
programmatic development policy-based financial support starting in FY06 with a Development
Policy Grant (US$l5.0 million). Budget support from IDA w i l l help close the fiscal gap that Bhutan
faces in FY06 and mitigate the need for domestic financing as RGoB tries to meet i t s ambitious
development targets. Moreover, non-project-tied external assistance from development partners i s
likely to decline in the coming years since the Tala Hydropower Project i s expected to boost
government revenues.

102. The proposed DPG will be aligned with the CAS pillars, and support the ongoing reform
program underpinning the BFYPIF'RSP to enhance economic growth and reduce poverty. As
elaborated in the previous sections, the medium-term program under the DPG would likely focus on
reform actions to improve public expenditure and financial management, promote private sector
development, and improve service delivery and M&E in the health and education sectors.
Preparation o f the DPG will be facilitated by ongoing World Bank group support to build capacity
for public expenditure management and analytical work carried out by the Bank as well as other
development partners.

32

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

103. In line with the lessons learned, the proposed investment lending w i l l be selective, and
focused on priority areas consistent with the CAS outcomes, especially where the Bank has provided
successful assistance over time. In general, IDA lending w i l l complement other development
partners' efforts, while maximizing opportunities for strengthening collaboration and coordination.
104.
While sector-specific analytical work linked to lending would be undertaken as needed, the
program for analytical and advisory activities (AAA) would aim to be responsive to country needs
and capacity constrains. Accordingly, the CAS proposes a flexible AAA program characterized by a
limited number o f formal analytical activities (including about one report and one or two policy
notes per year), programmatic non-lending TA, and just-in-time AAA to respond effectively to
evolving client demand, so as to foster a common understanding o f critical policy and other reform
issues. Moreover, Bank Group capacity to offer non-lending services will be enhanced by seeking
collaboration with other donors whenever possible. Details o f the proposed country program by
CAS pillar are provided in Table 3 below and Annexes B3 and B4.

Lending Scenarios. I n FY06, Bhutan’s IDA allocation will be about US$14.5 million
equivalent. Based on the country’s risk o f debt distress, Bhutan will receive 100 percent o f this
assistance in grants. However, as agreed in the IDA 14 framework, Bhutan’s allocation based on its
I D A country performance in FY06 has been reduced by 20 percent in order to address equity and
moral hazard issues across all IDA countries. Assuming that Bhutan will continue to receive 100
percent grant assistance from IDA, the indicative allocation for the rest o f the CAS period would be
about US$44.0 million. In this respect, it should be noted that actual allocations after FY06 w i l l
depend on (i)the country’s own performance; (ii)i t s performance relative to the performance of
other IDA countries; (5)the amount o f overall resources available to IDA; (iv) changes in the l i s t o f
active IDA-eligible countries; and (iv) terms o f financial assistance provided (grants and/or loans).
Nevertheless, a substantial reduction in the allocation in the outer years o f the CAS i s highly unlikely
since Bhutan has been a consistent good performer, as reflected in i t s ratings under the country
policy and institutional assessment (CPIA). In case that the Development Policy Grant i s delayed,
the Bank would consider bringing forward some o f the investment projects which are being prepared
in parallel, including the second Rural Access Roads Project (which i s a repeater project), andor
increasing financial support to the rural road sector and other areas such urban development and
private sector development.
106. During the CAS period, the Bank Group w i l l also help Bhutan explore other sources o f
funding, such as carbon finance, guarantees, and other available instruments. Simultaneously, the

i
I

I

34

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

Bank Group will actively seek to work with development partners to promote co-financing in or
channeling o f funds to priority areas identified in the CAS.
107. With respect to carbon finance, the Bank Group would provide assistance on climate change
issues in partnership with other donors, and will facilitate RGoB’s participation in the emerging
carbon market by providing assistance in the identification and sale o f carbon assets to the Bankmanaged funds such as the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) and the Community Development Carbon
Fund (CDCF). One o f the mechanisms available i s the W B CF-Assist program, which can provide
capacity building and project development technical assistance grants to build and support the
designated national authority and to enable the development o f specific carbon finance transactions.
Initial consultations have identified several areas with good potential for carbon finance, such as
hydropower, biomass, and micro-hydro, and the Bank w i l l continue to work with the concerned
stakeholders to assist in their development following the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
guidelines.
108.
Expenditure Eligibility under the CAS. Country Financing Parameters (CFPs) for Bhutan
have been prepared and agreed upon by RGoB (see Attachment 9 for details). Under the CFPs, IDA
may finance 100 percent o f all project or program costs where needed and appropriate.
Nevertheless, RGoB considers counterpart funding to be desirable and the Bank will encourage it.
The CFPs reflect the fact that RGoB has followed prudent fiscal and debt management policies in the
past. Although a large part o f government capital expenditures i s financed from external assistance
(mostly grants), RGoB has borrowed from I D A cautiously and within the framework of the
9FYP/PRSP, and according to national priorities identified through a countrywide participatory
process. Bank project financing i s fully integrated into the budget and thus part o f RGoB’s overall
prudent and sound fiscal management. At the same time, RGoB has implemented IDA-financed
projects relatively successfully, despite challenges’ such as the small size o f the civil service, the
rugged terrain, scattered population, and difficult communications. The financing parameters for
cost sharing, local and recurrent costs, and taxes and duties will be applied on a project-by-project
basis to ensure efficient implementation and sustainability after project closure.

V.
A.

DELIVERING THE BANK GROUP’S PROGRAM

Portfolio Management and Performance

109. The size o f the portfolio in Bhutan has increased in recent years, and w i l l continue to grow
during the implementation o f the new CAS. As o f August 2005, there were six active IDA-financed
operations, while in the past the average portfolio size has been about 3 to 4 operations. These
operations represented US$80 million in net commitments and US$47 million in undisbursed funds.
While two o f these projects (Education I1 and Urban Development) will close in 2005,
implementation o f the remaining projects w i l l continue until 2009. In the past, lending has been
lumpy: US$5.4 million in FY94, US$13.7 million in FY98, US$22.4 million in FYOO, US$36.8
million in FY04, and US$7.0 million in FY05. Under the proposed strategy, lending would be more
continuous, with at least one new grant or credit provided every fiscal year.
110. As detailed in the CAS Completion Report (see Attachment 6), portfolio performance
monitoring and assessment, on the one hand, and supervision o f the country program on the other,
have faced several challenges. Regarding the former, the main issue i s that every single project in
Bhutan counts in Bank reports o f country portfolio performance. In other words, the small size o f
the portfolio makes some o f the indicators used by the Bank to monitor and assess portfolio
performance difficult to apply. Presently, all projects are rated satisfactory, and over time portfolio
risk indicators have remained close to and have occasionally been better than regional and Bank

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

35

averages. The disbursement ratio has been close to or above 20 percent recently, although this figure
hides differences in disbursement performance across projects.
111.
Bank supervision has been constrained by not having a local office in the country, and
RGoB prefers a direct relation with the Bank in Washington. The small portfolio size has intensified
the challenge o f ensuring staff continuity and focused attention o f management. At the same time,
Bhutan’s geography demands time and resources not often available to ensure even supervision
across project sites. Furthermore, the country program did not have a dedicated Operations Adviser
until recently, while in-country and in-depth portfolio performance reviews have never been
conducted in the case o f Bhutan.

112. During the CAS period, the Bank w i l l pay close attention to quality at entry and project
supervision to maintain the quality o f the portfolio and ensure both smooth project implementation
and successful achievement o f project outcomes. An additional effort will be made to follow up
more consistently, while project restructuring w i l l be conducted for projects with persistent
problems. Special attention w i l l be paid to the project’s M&E systems to make sure they are
realistic, adequate, and supportive o f the overall framework for monitoring PRSP and CAS
outcomes.

B.
Partnerships and Harmonization
113.
Donor support in Bhutan i s aligned with the 9FYP/PRSP, and their areas o f focus reflect, for
the most part, the Royal Government’s suggestions and requests as well as their comparative
advantage. There i s no formal Local Consultative Group (LCG) in the country, but UNDP has
adequately taken on the role o f donor coordinating agency. Partially because o f its secondary
financial role and lack o f a local office, the Bank has not traditionally played a leading role in donor
coordination in Bhutan. Nevertheless, during CAS implementation, the Bank plans to enhance its
interaction with UNDP, ADB, and other development partners.
114.
Several donor sub-groups have been created recently and point agencies and staff have been
nominated to facilitate interaction with multilaterals, such as the Bank, and other bilateral donors
lacking a local office in the country. UNDP w i l l also continue to assist the Government organize the
round-table donor meetings.

115. Harmonization is a critical issue for donor coordination and project implementation in a
small country such as Bhutan. Small size and good governance make Bhutan a good candidate for
further reliance on country systems, and a country that can benefit substantially from the Bank’s
simplification agenda. During the CAS period, the Bank, in close coordination with development
partners, w i l l strive to rely incrementally on country institutions and procedures, initially through
sectors where capacity to ensure compliance o f safeguards and fiduciary requirements i s considered
to be relatively adequate. At the same time, capacity will be strengthened in weak sectors I areas,
while the country team w i l l endeavor to maximize the opportunities to reduce transaction costs and
project processing by applying in Bhutan, to the extent possible, the simplification agenda as well as
maximizing the use o f new policies such as the flexibility in expenditure eligibility.
116. To facilitate the above process, the Bank has started in FY06 an effort to understand better
the country systems related to social and environmental safeguards, as well as procurement and
financial management. It i s expected that this work would help identify areas where country systems
need strengthening to bring them closer to equivalence to the Bank’s, and if possible t o other donors’
safeguard policies. While working with RGoB and donors to promote the harmonization agenda,

36

Bhutan Country Assistance StrategV

this work will initially help identify the extent o f applicability o f the country systems to Bankfinanced projects, and the steps needed to ensure this applicability.
C.
Monitoring Implementation and Results
117. The results matrix described in Section IV-A and Attachment 8 indicate a set o f priority
outcome objectives that the Bank expects to influence during the CAS period, outcome indicators to
measure impact, and intermediate indicators / milestones that w i l l be used to assess progress toward
these outcomes.
118.
Gender w i l l continue to be mainstreamed through the project design of IDA-financed
operations in Bhutan, as it was done recently in the HIV/AIDS Prevention Project and the
Decentralized Rural Development Project. The gender-specific impact o f Bank assistance w i l l be
monitored whenever feasible.
119.
Implementation o f the 9FYP will finish in June 2007, and the 10FYPPRSP will cover FY07
to FY 11. As such, the CAS Progress Report, which should be prepared towards the end o f FY07,
w i l l be a critical instrument to assess progress in CAS implementation, and adjust the strategy to
address any changes in priorities andor country conditions.

VI.

MANAGING R I S K S

120. Key Economic Assumptions. The successful implementation o f the 9FYP/PRSP, which the
proposed CAS supports, i s predicated on several assumptions. If these do not materialize, the
development progress o f Bhutan would be seriously imperiled. Given the dependence on
hydropower (expected to account for about 25 percent o f GDP and about 50 percent o f total
government revenues once Tala comes on stream), a key assumption i s that the strong commercial
ties with India w i l l continue, involving both the sale o f electricity and the financing o f new
hydropower projects. Development prospects w i l l also hinge on continued donor support, especially
from India, which has agreed to provide program grants through the last year o f the 9FYP/PRSP,
though at lower levels. Finally, the macro-framework assumes that macroeconomic management
w i l l continue to be sound in the years ahead, maintaining the fixed exchange rate, containing
inflation, and managing fiscal imbalances and debt stocks. These risks are mitigated by the
historically strong ties between Bhutan and India, and the GoI’s recent agreement to increase the
power tariff paid on electricity sales from Chukha. The Royal Government i s also endeavoring to
strengthen i t s macro/fiscal management capacity, and these efforts will be supported during CAS
implementation. Moreover, the country continues to maintain a high level o f reserves to ensure the
sustainability o f the exchange rate parity with the Indian rupee.
121. Political Reform. As noted above, a new Constitution is being finalized, which in the
medium term i s to herald a democratically elected national government. The impact o f this on the
political process i s difficult to forecast. The democratic machinery, in terms o f forming political
parties, managing the electoral process, and ensuring adequate advisory support for the National
Council, may face capacity constraints. However, the process being followed i s highly participatory
and being paced to allow national capacity building to implement the required changes in the
political system. Policy makers have shown strong commitment to implementing the reform agenda
underpinning the country’s 9FYP/PRSP.
122. Natural / External Hazards. The mountains in Bhutan are comparatively young in
geological terms, and monsoon-induced landslides are a significant risk, damaging roads and leading
to the phenomenon of glacial lake outburst flooding. Bhutan i s also vulnerable t o other potential

Bhutan Country Assistance Strategy

37

hazards outside o f its control, such as epidemics like SARS and avian influenza or terrorism in other
parts o f the world hurting tourism. Following the September 11 attacks in the United States and
epidemic outbreaks in Asia, tourist arrivals to Bhutan f e l l sharply, and it has taken three years for the
number o f tourist arrivals to return to previous levels. Improving land management, using
environmentally friendly road construction methods, providing adequate resources for operations and
maintenance, and monitoring glacial lakes prone to bursting, are some o f the relevant mitigating
factors. An additional risk i s the possible re-emergence o f disturbances in border areas with India,
which could impinge the movement o f goods and people in Bhutan and harm trade with India.
Bhutan and India, however, continue to collaborate closely to maintain the situation under control.
123. Capacity Issues Related to Ambitious Targets and Increased . Revenue.
The
implementation o f government programs and initiatives, especially in the area o f decentralization,
faces capacity constraints. In general, managing donors active in Bhutan i s challenging at the
various government levels. Capacity i s particularly weak at the local level, and at times local
officials find it difficult to implement donor-financed projects. In addition, governance institutions
for ensuring transparency and accountability w i l l need to be strengthened as the revenues from Tala
accrue, if these are to have maximum development impact. These risks are mitigated by strong
leadership, ongoing efforts to steadily build capacity, and growing efforts to improve donor
coordination and harmonization, and to use country systems as these are strengthened. There i s also
a good precedent in the case o f Bhutan that despite capacity constraints, increased revenues from
hydropower development have been used efficiently to promote country priorities regarding human
development and infrastructure. Historically, RGoB has spent heavily on services aimed at helping
the poor, such as primary education, primary health, and rural access. To help the government in this
endeavor, i t was agreed t o make strengthening the management o f public resources a pillar o f this
CAS.
124. Development Policy-Based Financial Support. As noted above, the proposed
Development Policy Grant (FY06) i s the first policy-based operation in Bhutan. There i s a risk that
the preparation o f the operation may not proceed at the needed pace, and it may take longer to define
the components o f the reform program to be supported by the Bank or to implement some o f the
agreed actions. A delay i n the DPG would heighten the need for domestic financing. Nevertheless,
RGoB has demonstrated its commitment to the reform agenda, and the deepening o f the policy and
reform dialogue should help mitigate this risk.

Attachment 1
Progress Toward Achieving the Millennium Development Goals
1.
Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger. The Royal Government remains
committed to poverty reduction, as reflected in the high share o f spending allocated to sectors such
as education and health. The MDG objective of reducingpoverty by hayby 2015 is likely to be met
assuming sustained government commitment, robust economic growth, and the coming on stream of
Tala. Simple projections using the BLSS under a hypothetical scenario show that poverty could
decrease from 31.7 per cent in 2003 to 9 per cent in 2015 if the benefits o f growth are distributed
equally. 29
2.

Goal 2: Achieve Universal Primary Education. Bhutan has made tremendous gains since

it started the effort to bring formal education to all parts o f the country less than 30 years ago. Not

only has access to education been expanded, but quality has also improved. As mentioned above, the
gross enrollment rate (GER) at the primary level was over 92 percent in 2003. The net enrollment
rate (NER), however, remains much lower than GER, indicating age-by-age misalignment and
internal inefficiency due to late entry, repetition, and early dropout.30 Specifically, the BLSS
indicates that the NER at the primary level was 69 percent nationally and 65 percent in rural areas in
2003, while significant differences in enrollment rates were evident across consumption quintiles,
even within rural and urban areas and despite education being free. Presently, only one-third o f the
students who start attending school complete the primary cycle on time. A concerted effort is thus
required ifBhutan is to meet the Education MDG by 2015.
3.
Goal 3: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women. Comparatively, Bhutan i s a
country without explicit discrimination towards girls or women and the gender gap has decreased
substantially. The latter has been underpinned by positive trends in girls’ literacy and access to
education. Literacy rates have increased much faster for girls than for boys, and over the past
decade, girls’ primary enrollment rate has been nearly twice the rate o f boys’ enrollment. In fact,
Bhutan i s close to reaching gender parity at the primary level.

4.
Despite such progress, however, gender disparities remain. Formally, women enjoy equal
opportunities, entitlements, and legal status, but there are gaps in areas such as higher-level
education and enterprise development. In education in particular, net and gross enrollment rates and
literacy rates are s t i l l higher for boys than for girls. According to the BLSS, entry rates are only 56.5
percent for girls against 72.0 percent for boys. 3’ These gender differences stem, to a great extent,
from the emphasis s t i l l given to traditional gender roles and the lower access to public services
experienced by girls given that distance i s more constraining for them than for boys. In general,
there i s a need to develop methodologies to conduct gender disaggregated analysis and measurable
indicators to assess progress on achieving gender equality. It is unclear whether Bhutan will be able
to meet the gender MDG by 2015, but for it to succeed, specific measures are required, such as
increasing girls ’participation in schools.

29

These projections assume an average GDP growth rate o f 5.5 percent per year and a population growth rate o f 2.5
percent, under a scenario o f constant inequality.
”International norms do not often capture adequately Bhutan’s unique circumstances. A lower NER, for instance, is
partially explained by the fact that in rural areas many children are too small at 5 and 6 years o f age (the standard age for
tabulating NER) to reach schools. Usually, children do not begin the primary cycle until they are 7 or 8 years old, when
they are better able to manage the rugged terrain.
” Entry rates are defined as the share o f 13 to 19 years children who have ever attended school.

40

Attachment I: Progress TowardAchieving the MDG
Page 2 of 3

5.
Goal 4: Reduce Child Mortality. National health surveys indicate that infant mortality i s
likely to have decreased from 102.8 to 60.5 between 1984 and 2000 and under-five mortality from
162.4 to 84.0 over the same period. However, Bhutan has a lower performance than Bolivia, a
country in the same range o f per capita GDP and similar geography.

6.
I t is likely that Bhutan will meet the MDG objective of reducing by two-thirds the under-jTve
mortality. This would imply that the country’s infant and under-five mortality rates would have to
decrease to 41 and 30 respectively, but some indicators closely correlated with child mortality are
s t i l l very low. First, in rural areas, only 77.0 percent o f the population has access to safe water.
Second, cooking on open fires in poorly ventilated houses i s common and i s responsible for
respiratory illnesses, which are s t i l l the main cause o f under-five mortality. Third, in rural areas, only
49.0 percent o f the deliveries are medically assisted and only 28.4 percent o f the deliveries occur in a
hospital or a maternity ward. The picture i s better in urban areas, but even there a quarter o f the
deliveries s t i l l occur at home without any medical assistance. Fourth, a nationwide EPI survey
conducted in 2001 reveals that only 64.5 percent o f the less than one-year-olds had received valid
vaccine doses. Any effort to further decrease child mortality would at minimum need to focus on
these four areas.

7.
Goal 5: Decrease Maternal Mortality. Based on the national health surveys, it i s estimated
that maternal mortality ratio decreased from 7.7 per 1000 live births to 2.6 between 1984 and 2000.
I t is likely that Bhutan will reach an MMR of 1.4 by 2015, thus meeting the objective of reducing the
Maternal Mortaliy Ratio (MMR) by three-quarters. However, maternal mortality rates are difficult
to measure and results should be interpreted with care. The main areas for potential progress are
prenatal care (only 66 percent o f the pregnant women in rural areas received prenatal care in 2003),
medical attendance at birth, and nutrition (iron intake i s often too low, which i s a major source o f
anemia).
8.
Goal 6: Combat HIV, AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases. Though isolated
geographically, Bhutan i s no longer impervious to HIV/AIDS. Bhutan i s at an early stage o f the
epidemic (UNAIDS estimate an HIV prevalence o f 0.01 percent o f the population), but i s
experiencing exponential growth o f detected cases. The country also exhibits many risk factors, such
as high rates of sexually transmitted infections, multiple sexual partners, commercial sex, and high
mobility within and outside the country. rfthe country deals with the challenges discussed below, it
may be able to curb HIV/AIDS successfully.
9.
Goal 7: Ensure Environmental Sustainability. The targets under this goal include
integrating the principles o f sustainable development into country policies and programs and
reversing the losses of environmental resources; halving by 2015 the proportion o f people without
access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation; and achieving by 2020 a significant improvement
in the lives o f at least 100 million slum dwellers (global level). For the most part, country policies
and programs reflect Bhutan’s strong commitment to the first target, towards which the country has
made relatively good progress. The National Environmental Strategy was completed in 1998 and the
Environmental Assessment Act approved in 2000, while formulation o f the National Environmental
Action Plan and Environmental Protection Act are underway. Simultaneously, conservation o f
natural resources has been a priority over the years, and today 72 percent o f the national territory i s
under forest cover, o f which 26 percent has been designated as protected areas and 9 percent as
biological corridors. Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation -the second target under this
goal - has substantially increased over the years (over 80 percent o f the population has access to safe
water and over 90 percent to latrines or toilets). However, rapid urbanization i s posing new
challenges as many towns do not have sewage and effluent treatment plants. Similarly, although

Attachment 1: Progress TowardAchieving the MDG
Page 3 of 3

41

squatter settlements are not yet visible in urban areas, the need for serviced urban land and affordable
housing i s increasing.

10.
Challenges to Achieving the Millennium Development Goals. At present, Bhutan faces
several challenges to achieving i t s MDGs and mitigating the impact o f ill health and lack of
education on economic growth and poverty alleviation:
Achieving Universal Education. According to the 9FYP/PRSP, only 69 percent o f those
entering primary school complete the seven years o f primary education, and 12 to 13
percent o f students repeat grades every year .32 Moreover, the remaining out-of-school
children are the hardest to reach and retain. Therefore, to meet the MDG on education,
Bhutan has to increase i t s efforts to reduce dropout and repetition, and to bring out-ofschool children into the education system. Presently, the gross primary completion rate i s
estimated at about 75 percent. Ensuring universal completion means reducing drop out
rates to zero, which requires making education more relevant and meaningful to students.
Reaching the out-of-school children i s a major challenge, since they belong to families that
are often the least likely to see the benefits o f education, to support their children to remain
in school, andor who live in remote, isolated communities. According to the 2003 BLSS,
nearly a third o f all 10- to 14-years olds work and many o f these children do not attend
school. This i s partly because large distances to school make it difficult for children to
combine both work and school, but may also be the result o f the direct and indirect costs o f
schooling for poor households. Moreover, many children and teenagers often drop out o f
school before completing the primary cycle and start to work. Finally, improving student
achievement, which i s currently low, i s also a major challenge.33

.

Improving Maternal Health. Though maternal health has improved significantly, women
continue to die from pregnancy and childbirth-related complications. Bhutan has one o f
the highest maternal mortality ratios in the region. With a low level o f modem

o f the births in the country are attended by trained personnel. To achieve this M D G (MMR
target o f 1.4) RGoB would need to meet i t s sector objectives o f expanding access to
Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) services, reducing maternal anemia (largely due to
iron deficiency), which was as high as 88.2 percent in 2001, and increasing the share o f

.Curbinn HIV/AIDS. To avoid a full-blown epidemic, which would have a devastating
impact on the country's economy and human development gains, prevention efforts need
to be focused on highly vulnerable subpopulations and on high transmission areas, such as
border towns. In addition, surveillance and monitoring and evaluation systems need to be
strengthened and operational research undertaken to obtain reliable data on distribution o f
risk behaviors and infection. A comprehensive care and treatment program, including antiretroviral therapy (ART), needs to be launched. For ART to be financially sustainable,
prevention programs need to be expansive and effective and adherence t o drugs vigorously
monitored to prevent resistance.

P o w e r Sector in Bhutan

1.
As part o f the Royal Government’s reform agenda, the power sector in Bhutan was
restructured through the Electricity Act 2001, The former Department o f Power o f the Ministry o f
Trade and Industry (MTI) was divided into three entities: (i)The Department o f Energy responsible
for planning and policy in the power sector, (ii)the Bhutan Electricity Authority as an independent
entity to license and regulate power companies, and (iii)the Bhutan Power Corporation as a
transmission, distribution and supply company. In addition, there are three state-owned generation
companies: Chukha, Kurichu, and Basochu Hydropower corporations. To gain economies o f scale,
these three companies w i l l be merged in the near future.
2.
The main features o f the power sector are as follows: the number o f connections in the
country are about 52,000 (40 percent overall access); the transmission and distribution losses are
below 13 percent; and the retail tariffs are U S $ 0.022 cents per unit, which are compensated by a
subsidized bulk supply tariff from the generation companies (US$ 0.75 cents). The sector’s
expansion plan sets a target o f 56 percent access rate by 2007 and universal access by 2020. The
expansion plans are being financed by grants and soft loans from ADB and Government o f Austria.
The installed capacity in the country (468 M W ) exceeds the demand (105 MW), and the surplus
energy (about 300MW) i s currently exported to India.
3.
The hydropower sector w i l l continue to be the major driver o f growth for Bhutan in the long
term, as it has been for over the past two decades. The sector contributed to more than 20 percent of
overall growth between FY86 and FY04; since the late 1990s, the construction work o f Tala alone
has raised GDP by about 5 percent. Presently, electricity exports - all o f which are to India represent 40 percent of all exports o f goods and services. Crucially, once Tala comes on stream, the
share o f hudget revenue from the sector will increase from one third to one half and the share o f the
sector in GDP to 25 percent. Overall, Tala i s likely to result in a jump in real GDP o f over 18
percent, despite the expected contraction in the construction sector.34 In contrast, the impact on
employment generation has been modest. Nevertheless, the use o f foreign labor, equipment, and
materials during the construction o f major hydropower plans has mitigated the pressure on domestic
resources.
4.
The Government o f India (GoI) has played a key role in financing hydropower projects in
Bhutan. Thus far, domestic resources have only been used to develop Basochu (64 MW in total). In
this case,’ RGoB contributed with 10 percent o f total cost. Moreover, a substantial portion o f
construction costs have been covered by grants - 60 percent under the arrangement with India and 25
percent in the case o f Austria. In addition, India has provided the remaining 40 percent as loan (20
years maturity and 9 percent interest rate in rupees). Chukha Hydropower Plant (336 MW), financed
by GoI, was completed under these arrangements, and the loan will be repaid in two years. Tala
Hydropower Project (1020MW) has been financed under the same approach at a total amount o f
US$l.16 billion. According to IMF estimates, all hydropower projects are expected to maintain
positive cash flows and favorable rates of return.

5.
Bhutan has only started to tap into its hydropower potential. The goals in the hydropower
sector as stated in the BFYPRRSP are to strengthen the economic self-reliance o f the country by
realizing the electricity generation capacity (the goal i s to install additional 2700 MW capacity by
2020); to provide adequate, safe and reliable electricity through sustainable and environmentally
friendly development o f hydroelectric potential; and to reach 100 percent rural electrification by
IMF estimates; for further details see Article I V Report, June 2005.

2020. Tala will more than triple electricity generating capacity. According to the Power Master
Plan, the next power plants to be constructed are: (i)Punatsangchu (1030 MW), with construction
expected to start in 2007; (ii)
Mangdechu (670MW), with construction planned to begin in 2009; and
(iii)Punatsangchu I1(990 MW), with construction expected to start in 2012. The investment required
will be about US$ 2.6 billion. These new projects would boost the construction sector again and
help raise growth.

Attachment 3
Potential Sources o f G r o w t h and E m p l o y m e n t

1.
Balancing growth requires promoting promising sectors beyond the power sector.
According to the Fund, nonpower sectors should grow at about 6 to 7 percent during the FY06-10
period to ensure that Bhutan achieves and maintains the projected growth rates.35Agriculture will
remain critical, since it i s s t i l l the largest contributor to GDP. Sectors with great potential include
tourism, agri-processing, information and communications technology (ICT) and forestry.
Tourism, which currently accounts for less than 2 percent o f GDP, is a sector with very
strong potential, especially f o r employment generation. Under the 9FYP/PRSP, the objective i s to
raise tourist arrivals to 15,000 by end o f FY07. This target, however, s t i l l leaves room for further
expansion without compromising the country’s vision o f balanced growth and cultural and
environmental preservation. The tourism sector grew strongly in 2004, and the number o f tourist
arrivals reached 9,249, exceeding the peak reached in 2000, before the September 1 1, 2001 terrorist
attacks in the United States, and the 2003 outbreak o f SARS in East Asia. About a third o f the
tourists to Bhutan come from the United States. Some advances have been made in developing the
sector in recent years to facilitate international access to Bhutan, which i s one o f the major
constraints to tourism development. Druk Air (a public company and the only carrier flying to
Bhutan) purchased two new aircraft, representing an US$78 million investment. Although these
planes are a major financial commitment for the RGoB, equivalent to 10 percent o f GDP, they have
increased passenger capacity by 42 percent over the existin aircraft, as well as providing additional
cargo capacity that should help the nascent export sector!6 With IFC financing, two new luxury
hotels ’have been established, and the local Tashi Commercial Corporation has also begun the
construction o f a major hotel in Thimphu that will be run by the India-based Taj hotel group.
Tourism, however, suffers from the seasonality o f the market, limited access to the country, lack o f
tourism infrastructure, and generally inadequate standards o f accommodation. The sector i s also
subject to international fluctuations, as demonstrated by the fall in tourist arrivals after the September
11 events. To provide more strategic direction to the sector, the Government o f Austria i s helping
RGoB develop a tourism master plan.

2.

3,
Agri-processing i s another potential source o f growth in Bhutan, and has been identified as
a priority export sector. At present, the agri-processing business in Bhutan consists o f a wide range
of products including agriculturehorticulture, non-timber forest products, and livestock. In terms o f
the percentage o f firms by industrial sector, agro-based and forest-based industries are the two
largest. Both industries are dominated by the private sector, and provide employment to a large
number o f people.
4.
The sector faces several challenges, however, due to the dispersion o f the population,
general remoteness, and the difficulties o f transport and communications. Coupled with this, farmers
incur heavy losses to their output due to wildlife and post-harvest damages, amounting to as much as
30 to 40 percent o f total production. Land i s relatively expensive for Bhutanese to acquire, since the
difficult terrain makes arable land very scarce. As a result, holdings are typically small and
fragmented. The majority o f farmers are small peasant farmers, at or just above subsistence. Under
these conditions, generating a surplus i s a challenge. Labor input per unit area i s generally high.
Traditionally, the agriculture system in Bhutan has depended on crop farming, livestock rearing, and
forestry products. However, population growth has increased the pressure on Bhutan’s limited
natural resource base, particularly arable land. Nonetheless, opportunities for private sector
development in these sub-sectors exist if concerted inroads are made in addressing the binding
business environment constraints.
for the 2005 Article I V Consultation, June 3, 2005.
Mainly due to the purchase o f the new planes, the current account deficit i s expected to widen sharply from 8.4 percent
o f GDP in FY04 to 24.6 o f GDP in FYOS.

5.
While existing yields in agricultural and horticultural crops are generally poor, the use o f
improved varieties and better management practices could readily double or triple yields.
Horticulture i s one of the most promising areas: it accounts for nearly all agriculture exports and
half o f the total value-added in the sector, though accounting for only 7 percent of the crop area. The
Royal Government plans to investigate the market potential of new crops, the requirements to
position the products as premium products, and the needs for transport, packaging, harvesting,
collection, sorting and grading, and seeds. Much needs to be done in providing appropriate laborsaving technology and efficient post harvest and agri-processing methods, so that productivity o f
labor per unit area i s enhanced.
6.
With huge potential in India and Bangladesh, most fresh Bhutanese products can be sold
easily as long as they are properly graded and packed with attractive brands. For these high-value,
low-volume products, the strategy also should be to capture niche markets in developed countries,
stressing that the products are organic. There are opportunities also to increase the cultivation and
export o f sub-tropical fruits (citrus and mangoes), winter vegetables, strawberries, plums, cherries,
pears, exotic mushrooms, as well as organic products such as red rice. I n total, Bhutan could
conceivably achieve a target of agricultural exports o f about US$30 million over the coming decade,
or approximately three times current export levels?’

7.
A second area of potential lies in exploiting the high-value and low-volume non-timber
forestry products such as mutsutuke mushrooms, Cordyceps sinensis (Chinese caterpillar fungus, a
high-altitude medicinal product), and lemongrass oil. All o f these products command very high
prices in export markets. With its rich forests, Bhutan could also be a major supplier o f medicinal
and aromatic herbs and plants. The natural availability o f these products could be increased through
better husbandry and commercial cultivation. Markets for these products in the United States and
Europe are growing rapidly.
8.
The Royal Government considers information and communications technology (ICT),
and the knowledge-based industries that it enables an attractive source o f economic growth, and has
formulated a strategy to guide ICT development in the country. ICT plays both to Bhutan’s strengths
and avoids the country’s major constraints. For instance, ICT services would take advantage o f the
disciplined, English-speaking workforce and relatively developed telecommunications network. Yet
it would not be constrained by the mountainous terrain, extreme weather, and geographic isolation.
I n addition, ICT services would not impose a large burden on the country’s natural resources, and i s
highly compatible with the country’s goal o f preserving the natural environment. The ICT sector i s
still in i t s infancy in Bhutan, and it will take some time before the country i s able to export
significant ICT services or knowledge-based products. I n the meantime, rapid development o f the
sector holds enormous promise for improving productivity and increasing competitiveness in
existing private sector industries.

9.
With respect to forestry, dialogue between RGoB and the private sector has shown
promising results. The recently formed Wood-based Industries Association has been engaged on
such issues as domestic timber auctions and export o f semi-finished products. Private sector
investment in the forest sector has significant potential to provide incremental employment
opportunities in the near term. However, promoting growth and expanded employment through
forest products industries will require an improved investment climate with rational and stable
marketing and pricing policies, expanded opportunities to export value-added wood products,
adoption o f improved processing technology, and strengthened management capacity.

Attachment 4
Public and External Debt Dynamics3’
1.
Background. Bhutan’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 42
percent o f GDP in FYOO to 87.5 percent in FY04, and i s expected to peak upon completion o f the
Tala Hydropower Project in FY06 at about 103 percent o f GDP. In FY05, public debt was already
expected to rise substantially due to the large projected fiscal deficit. The latter, at the same time,
reflects the purchase of the two new airplanes for DrukAir at a cost o f about 10 percent o f GDP.
External PPG debt (about 80 percent o f GDP) was comprised o f Nu 14.2 million (close to 48
percent o f GDP) in India rupee debt and US$216 million (33 percent o f GDP) in convertible
currency. Domestic debt amounted to 7 percent o f GDP, mostly related to the issuance o f bonds to
finance the new airplanes.

2.
The sharp increase in public debt i s mostly related to external borrowing for hydropower
projects. In FY04 debt related to these types o f projects, which are not included in the budget,
totaled 56 percent o f GDP, or about 60 percent o f the total debt stock. Nevertheless, debt service
obligations related to loans for the hydropower sector seem manageable. Moreover, hydropower
projects are projected to maintain positive cash flows and favorable rates o f return.

3.
Outlook o f Debt Dynamics. External PPG debt i s projected to rise until FY07 and remain
in a decline trend thereafter. In FY07 a declining trend in the debt-to-GDP ratio i s projected to start,
assuming continued high GDP growth and moderation o f the fiscal deficits. In FY07 a fall o f 16
percentage points o f GDP i s projected, reflecting the jump in GDP. A decline in average o f 6
percentage o f GDP per annum should continue afterwards. I t should be noted that new hydropower
projects, which would alter the anticipated trajectory, have not been included in these projections.
Nevertheless, under several stress tests, total PPG debt remains in a declining trend, assuming
moderate fiscal policies. On the other hand, although primary fiscal deficits have averaged more
than 6 percent o f GDP in the last four years, their effect on debt dynamics has been limited by the
country’s good economic performance and the highly concessional terms o f the debt
4.
In N P V terms, external debt i s projected to peak around 75 percent o f GDP in FY06 and
decline around 45 percent o f GDP by FY10.39The largest source o f decline i s due to the decline in
rupee debt obligations, as power sector loans are paid off. The NPV o f rupee loans is expected to
decline from 54 percent o f GDP in FY06 to 25 percent by FY10. Convertible currency debt i s
projected to remain broadly stable around 20 percent o f GDP.
5.
The ratio of debt service to total exports o f goods and services i s expected to average 15-1 6
percent during FY06-10. By currency, the ratio o f convertible currency debt service to hard
currency ‘exports o f goods and services i s projected to average 18.25 percent; the ratio o f rupee debt
service to rupee exports i s projected to average 15.25 percent.

38
39

This Section i s based on the Fund’s Bhutan - StaffReport for the 2005 Article I V Consultations, June 3,2005
According to the IMF Article I V Report, computation o f NPV for external PPG debt i s underpinned by the following
assumptions: For convertible currency debt, the NPV calculations are based on discounting the debt service payments
(amortization plus interest) by the OECD Commercial Interest Reference Rate (CIRR). For simplicity, the discount rate
used in the computation is five percent for all convertible currency loans. In the absence o f a CIRR for rupee loans, the
discount rate assumed for Indian rupee debt i s 11.75 percent. This reflects the pre- and post-shipment lending rates o f
scheduled commercial banks in India for export credits on longer maturities (180-270 days) prevailing around mid-2004.
In the case o f outstanding rupee debt, interest during construction i s added to the stream o f forthcoming debt service
payments. For convertible currencies, NPV calculations assume new disbursements consistent with the balance of
payment projections.

Summary o f CAS Consultations
Participatory and Consultative Process
1.
This CAS draws upon a consultative process led by the Country Director, which took place
between October 2004 and September 2005, including three missions to Bhutan (October 2004,
March 2005, and June 2005) and continuous exchange o f information. As part o f the process, the
Regional Vice-president also visited Bhutan in November 2004. In addition, in June 2005, the
Country Director met with concerned officials o f the Government o f India (GoI) in Delhi to update
them on the CAS process and learn about GoI’s planned assistance to Bhutan. Given the central role
it w i l l play in future economic growth, the CAS team also visited the Tala Hydropower Project
during the March 2005 mission. Due to several factors, including timing and the lack o f a country
office to facilitate the process, a joint ADB-World Bank country assistance preparation process was
not possible at this time. However, ADB has been consulted and provided inputs to the draft CAS,
and the Bank plans to coordinate CAS implementation closely with ADB counterparts.

2.
Importantly, the CAS core team included two government officials who participated actively
in the consultation process carried out throughout the country, contributed to the drafting and
reviewing of the CAS, and participated in the upstream Regional Operations Committee (ROC)
review of the CAS.41 The consultation process was advanced in close collaboration with the
Department o f Aid and Debt Management (DADM) in the Ministry o f Finance, which helped
organize the meetings with line ministries, local governments, and communities. In addition,
consultation with donors was greatly assisted by UNDP and with the private sector by the Bhutan
Chamber o f Commerce and Industry (BCCI).
Main Messages and Outcomes f r o m the CAS Consultation Process

3.
Consultations included upstream discussions and downstream consultations, and included
meetings with the Ministry o f Finance, line ministries, city corporation officials in Thimphu and
Phuentsholing, dzonghkag- and geog-level officials, donors, the private sector, and community
representatives. The upstream or initial discussions aimed to gauge from stakeholders their views on
the Bank’s past engagement and i t s future role, and to understand better national and local
development priorities as well as other development partners’ views on Bank support and their own
future assistance plans. Downstream consultations helped confirm the proposed strategy and refine
the future lending and analytical and advisory activities (AAA) program. In general, the inputs from
CAS consultations helped shape the proposed strategy and program, and ensured that the program
would reflect the country priorities and goals outlined in the 9FYPPRSP. Consultations also allowed
the CAS team to understand better the country conditions and the challenges faced by its citizens,
particularly those living in remote and isolated areas. At a higher level, the process helped confirm
the Royal Government’s commitment to sound macroeconomic management and concern with debt
sustainability.
Access to social services and markets, specifically by providing adequate national, rural, and
farm roads, was confirmed as a major priority by all stakeholders, This priority, at the same time,
was viewed as an integral part o f the greatest challenge stakeholders thought the country faced,

namely infrastructure development. Support for development o f the renewable natural resource
(RNR) sector and marketing, followed by human resources development were also considered
imp~rtant.~’Dealing with the challenges posed by the ongoing decentralization process was a major
concern expressed at the local level, particularly regarding capacity to deal with all the
responsibilities that have been delegated to the geog (block) level and with donor-supported projects
as well as with ensuring continuous flow o f resources. In this respect, a challenge identified at the
local level was the prioritization o f works while ensuring that these remain within the overall policy
framework o f the 9FYP/PRSP. Maintenance o f new assets and other related recurrent costs were
pinpointed as emerging issues by local officials. Local government officials and community
members agreed that decentralization has helped reflect better their development concerns and needs
in the allocation o f public resources.

5.

It i s clear that private sector development, given the small market and Bhutan’s geography,
i s not an easy task for RGoB or the business community. The private sector i s s t i l l in a nascent stage,

and most entrepreneurs are civil service retirees. In the most isolated districts, where subsistence
agriculture s t i l l prevails, development o f commercial activities i s quite difficult, and export-oriented
activities even more challenging. Private sector representatives identified labor issues as critical to
the future o f their enterprises, in addition to availability o f industrial land and access to finance. In
certain areas, such as engineering and information technology and communications (ICT), national
capacity i s s t i l l limited, while it i s not always possible or desirable to hire nationals f o r manual labor.
In this respect, it was felt that future labor policy should recognize the current situation of the
country, while national capacity i s increased and private sector jobs become more attractive to the
educated youth. On the regulatory side, the private sector would like to see in general a clearer
strategic and policy direction for the development o f the sector in the country, and in particular a
more streamlined process for establishing a business. The capacity o f private sector associations to
promote their respective areas was also considered important.
6.
The CAS consultation process helped strengthen the relationship o f the Bank with
development partners active in Bhutan. It was noted by several donors that co-financing o f IDAsupported projects has proved to be beneficial to the country, helping leverage resources and
promote capacity building. On the other hand, it was also emphasized that, although in some sectors
the Bank has had long standing partnerships with donors, the Bank has not always coordinated with
development partners or communicated strategic decisions that concerned them. In addition to
sector-specific coordination, there were crosscutting areas where a special effort should be made,
including M&E of poverty and MDG indicators, macroeconomic statistics, and the analysis and
strengthening o f country systems to move the harmonization agenda forward. N o t just lending but
also AAA should be coordinated or developed as shared efforts to avoid duplication o f work. The
fact that the Bank does not have a country office in Bhutan i s a major challenge that should be
mitigated by working closely with UNDP, which leads in-country donor coordination, while
recognizing that RGoB should remain in the driver’s seat regarding the development agenda and the
ways it wants i t s development partners to support it. The next donor roundtable meeting, tentatively
planned for February 2006, and the preparation o f the next five year development plan/PRSP should
provide ample opportunities for donors to work together.

42

The RNR sector includes crop and livestock production, forestry, farm roads, and natural resource management.

1,
This report presents an assessment o f the last - indeed, the second - Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Bhutan, which was discussed by the Board in December 1999.43 The f i r s t CAS had been
discussed in July 1993 in the context o f the Third Forestry Development Project.

2.
To identify lessons relevant to the design and implementation o f the new results-based CAS, the
assessment took into consideration: the alignment o f the CAS with the country’s goals and expected
development results (Section B); the level o f achievement o f CAS outcomes between FYOO and FY05,
and the Bank’s contribution to these outcomes (Section C); and the Bank’s related performance during
this period (Section D). A summary o f lessons i s included in Section E and the last column o f Table A.
Overview

3,
Bhutan possesses a set o f distinctive characteristics that have influenced Bank assistance. These
include, in addition to being a small, landlocked nation state, having relatively sound public institutions, a
long tradition o f participatory governance, and a strong development vision that stresses cultural and
environmental preservation and investing in people. In many ways, Bhutan’s participatory development
planning foreshadows the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) adopted by the Bank. The
country also has substantial hydropower assets, which it has started exploiting in a beneficial manner
mainly with support from India - i t s largest single donor and trading partner.44Nevertheless, the country’s
economy remains basically agrarian, and the livelihood o f almost 80 percent o f the total population
depends on agriculture and livestock. Importantly, the Royal Government o f Bhutan (RGoB) has
followed a prudent fiscal and debt management approach, and has endeavored to finance recurrent
expenditures with domestic resources while relying on external grant and highly concessional financing,
mostly from bilateral donors, for capital investments. A process o f political reform and decentralization is
underway, with far reaching changes introduced in recent years, including elections at the local level and
the drafting o f the nation’s Constitution.
4.
During the CAS period (FYOO-05), the impact o f Bank assistance was satisfactory, although
generally modest, given the limited role o f the Bank in Bhutan. The exception to this i s education, where
the Bank contributed substantially to improving access and quality. A s corroborated by OED, IDA
In addition to country team inputs, the assessment i s based on Bank data and reports related to the country program’s quality,
responsiveness, and effectiveness. These include the Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) completed by OED in June 2004, as
well as Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) and assessments by OED and QAG and project supervision documents.
44 India grant aid supports about a quarter o f the Royal Government’s expenditure. Bhutan has a free trade agreement with India,
which accounts for 80 percent o f the country’s imports and 90 percent o f exports (mainly electricity exports). Moreover, the
Bhutanese ngultrum is pegged to the Indian rupee, and imports From India are payable in rupees. India has provided grants and
soft loans to help Bhutan complete several hydropower projects, and power i s currently exported only to India.

lending was largely effective as well as sensitive to the country’s culture and conditions. The Bank
provided some useful analytical work and policy advice, but in general Bhutan did not benefit as much as
it should have from the Bank’s non-lending services. The CAS expectation that the Bank would play a
prominent role as a “knowledge bank” in Bhutan could not materialize. While the principles o f flexibility,
selectivity, and partnership with donors underpinned the FY00 CAS, these were not always closely
followed during CAS implementation. Going forward, these should be approached more strategically.
A.

CAS Context

5.
When the CAS was prepared in 1999, Bhutan’s fiscal position and medium-term prospects
seemed favorable, and aid inflows stable. Specifically, macroeconomic balances were comfortable, while
medium-term economic growth prospects appeared favorable and grant and concessional aid flows
sufficient to meet the financing needs o f the Eighth Five-Year Plan (8FYP), which was to be completed in
June 2002. Between 1993 and 1998, Bhutan received an average o f US$80 million per year in
disbursements o f concessional assistance, o f which about 85 percent was grant aid. Accordingly, the
RGoB was planning to continue i t s policy o f using grant aid from bilateral donors and UN agencies
before requesting multilateral assistance. Nevertheless, RGoB requested IDA financial assistance for rural
access roads and urban development, and two credits were respectively appraised during the CAS
preparation period and approved in December 1999.
6.
Given the above circumstances, in the medium term IDA financial assistance was expected to be
modest. The Bank had recognized its limited and selective role in the first CAS for Bhutan, prepared in
1993, and focused on economic policy advice, natural resource management, and primary education. As
stated i n the FYOO CAS document, IDA’S support has been provided “only when other donors could not
put together a timely combination o f knowledge, expertise, and financing as requested by the
government.” Since Bhutan had not accessed Bank financing in a significant way in the past, accumulated
commitments in FY98 totaled US$41.8 million, and this total included the Second Education Project
(US$13.7 million) approved in March 1998 after almost five years without IDA lending.45 During these
years, IDA provided only 1 to 2 percent o f total aid disbursements. Moreover, World Bank Group
assistance was restricted to IDA, given that the country was not a member o f IFC or MIGA.
7.
The CAS identified several, long-term challenges faced by Bhutan, which remain relevant for
Bank assistance: Investments in hydropower sector development have helped accelerate economic growth
and social and human development, while increasing reliance on a single-market / single-commodity
export. In addition, given i t s characteristics, power sector growth was not resulting in substantial job
generation. Government employment stopped expanding, but the small and underdeveloped private sector
remains unable to provide opportunities for the growing labor force, particularly the educated youth. Not
only i s the country landlocked, but i t s small population i s spread over a difficult, mountainous terrain that
makes access to markets, technology, and services essential to development efforts, and improving access
to the global economy and internally challenging. Provision o f services i s generally costly as economies
o f scale are difficult to achieve. Although RGoB has good knowledge o f the conditions and development
needs across the country, national capacity for economic, demographic, and poverty data collection and
analysis has been weak, constraining policy design and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of development
results, particularly o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
8.
The CAS also noted concern with some signs of “Dutch disease” syndrome suffered by the
country. This was seemingly due to the substantial inflow o f foreign aid and o f foreign resources
originated by hydroelectric power exports, and to the constraints o f the exchange rate, as the Bhutanese
45

IDA commitments before 1998 amounted to US$28 million. The last credit for Bhutan before FY98 was the Third Forestry
Development Project (US65.4 million), approved on July 6, 1993.

ngultrum i s pegged to the Indian rupee, to lower the prices o f tradables vis-a-vis the non-tradables. As a
result, the real exchange tended to appreciate, making imports more attractive than exports and wages o f
Bhutanese farm and unskilled workers disproportionately higher than similar workers in India, thus
undermining the domestic competitiveness o f non-power exports while lowering labor absorption. This
syndrome was expected to become a more serious issue with the commissioning o f the Tala Hydropower

Bhutan’s Long-Term Development Goals and Results

9.
The FYOO CAS was aligned with Bhutan’s unique vision o f increasing Gross National Happiness
through a balanced and equitable development path that privileges happiness and satisfaction of the
population over economic growth. This principle has guided Bhutan’s efforts for the last two decades, and
was further articulated in 1999 in the document Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and
Happiness, and its underpinning strategy implemented during the CAS period through the 8FYP, and
currently under the Ninth Five-year Plan (9FYP), which constitutes the basis for the country’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Importantly, the 9FYP i s based on a consultative process that took over
two years, and included stakeholders from the national to the block (geog) level.
10.
To achieve its development vision, Bhutan has adopted four pillars: economic growth and
development, promotion and preservation o f cultural heritage, sustainable use o f the environment, and
good governance. The long-term strategic goals underpinning these pillars include maintaining sound
macroeconomic policy, ensuring good governance (especially by promoting decentralization), expanding
physical infrastructure (including roads, electricity, and telecommunications), and improving access to
social services (principally schools and health facilities). As reflected in the FYOO CAS, Bhutan has clear
medium- to long-term social and human development targets. The targets in the Eighth and Ninth Plans
are consistent with these long-term goals, and under the 9FYPPRSP, linked to the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).

1 1.
Bhutan continued to made good progress towards these goals during the CAS period, although it
i s not easy to provide reliable estimates due to uncertainty on the number o f total population and other
data and capacity constraint^.^' Substantial progress has certainly been made in gross school enrollment
rates (about 81 percent in 2003) and gender parity (girls represented 46 percent o f school enrollments in
2001). Child mortality has decreased by about half over the last two decades. The Royal Government,
however, would like to see faster progress in poverty reduction, since it i s estimated that about a third o f
the total population i s poor (based on a preliminary poverty line), with most o f the poor living in the rural
areas. Moreover, inequality i s relatively high (Gini coefficient o f 0.42 in 2003). The country has an
excellent record on environmental management, although it i s facing increasing pressure due to scarcity
o f arable land and urbanization. An additional challenge i s the unresolved issue o f citizenship claims o f
refugees living in Nepal. The Royal Government i s nevertheless fully committed t o finding a humane
solution to this issue.
C.

CAS Outcomes

12.
The strategic goal o f the FYOO CAS was to assist Bhutan, in partnership with other donors, in
realizing its. development vision by helping to ensure that rapid economic growth resulted in inclusive
46

41

Bank analysis conducted in 2003 indicated that Bhutan had avoided the “Dutch disease” syndrome. However, OED
recommended that this issue be revisited in light o f recent export trends and urban poverty values. It should also be noted that,
according to the Fund’s 2005 Article IV Report, despite the booming power sector, there has not been clear evidence of Dutch
disease thus far.
The first Population and Housing Census, following UN recommendations, should take place soon. A major limitation
regarding poverty analysis i s that the country does not have an official poverty line.

social transformation and poverty reduction. To meet this goal, the CAS recognized t h e pillars and longterm development outcomes relevant to the country’s vision. The CAS, however, was not explicitly a
results-based document, focusing on the inputs and processes rather than on the outcomes toward which
Bank assistance was to contribute during the CAS period. As was generally the case across the Bank,
monitoring progress of CAS implementation and impact on the ground were not sufficiently emphasized.

13.
Nevertheless, according to the priorities described in the CAS, the Bank expected to assist Bhutan
in macroeconomic policy and public expenditure management, education sector development, health
sector development, particularly through HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
prevention and treatment, rural access (mainly roads), urban development, and forestry management.
Although the CAS noted the shortcomings o f the private sector, it did not include any explicit support in
this area. Progress made in the priority areas, which have been retrofitted as “CAS outcomes” for this
assessment, and Bank contribution to achieving these outcomes, are discussed below after an overview of
CAS design and implementation issues.48See Table A for h r t h e r details on CAS outcomes.
CAS Design and Implementation Issues

14.
Under the assumption that the Bank would continue to play a limited lending role in Bhutan, the
CAS emphasized selectivity and the Bank’s comparative advantage in transferring knowledge and ideas
to Bhutan rather than finance. This “knowledge transfer first, then lending” approach was supported at the
time by RGoB and i t s fiscal and debt management policies. I n close partnership with RGoB, such
emphasis was also expected to help fill up information and knowledge gaps resulting from the Bank’s
limited past involvement in the country, particularly in such critical areas as growth, poverty, and public
expenditure. Accordingly, the CAS envisioned to place the Bank’s knowledge resources at the country’s
disposal without necessarily linking them to IDA credits, and included an open-ended l i s t o f Analytical
and Advisory Activities (AAA) to be carried out as needed by the government. Although no further
credits besides the two approved in FYOO were listed in the CAS, financing for priority poverty-reduction
areas o f human development and infrastructure - particularly in education and forestry - was to be
considered if requested by RGoB, following a standard project approach. In addition, the CAS mentioned
the possibility o f broad-based budget support credits, depending on country conditions and government
demand.

15.
Becoming a knowledge bank proved difficult, particularly since government demand for nonlending services did not reach the expected levels. As a result, Bhutan did not fully benefit from the
knowledge resources available at the Bank, and many o f the information and knowledge gaps identified in
the CAS document s t i l l remain. The Bank faced constraints due to its limited engagement and resources.
This situation was further exacerbated by the fact that government counterparts were not always aware,
nor made sufficiently aware o f what the Bank has to offer, particularly as it related to the benefits of some
o f the AAA suggested by the Bank. At the same time, there were resources, usually grant funding, made
available to RGoB from other donors. Due to its limited capacity, RGoB was also cautious about
engaging in too many analytical activities with too many donors.
16.
Despite the intention of emphasizingnon-lending services, almost 60 percent o f total IDA lending
to Bhutan has taken place after the Board discussion o f the FYOO CAS. This trend, it should be
emphasized, emerged as the Bank adjusted its strategy to changing circumstances under the 9FYP /
PRSP. When 9FYP implementation started in July 2002 (FY03), RGoB was facing a substantial financial
gap due to ambitious targets coupled with less than expected external assistance from development
48

Measuring progress was limited by the lack o f baseline and recent data, and the difficulty in observing significant changes in
some of the outcomes during the CAS period. Establishing with confidence direct cause and effect between the Bank’s
contribution and a specific outcome was also challenging given the relative small size o f the country program vis-&-vis
development needs, the presence o f many other actors, and t h e influence o f exogenous factors.

Attachment 6: CAS Completion Report

54

partners, At the time, after three fiscal years without borrowing, RGoB expressed renewed interest in
accessing all o f the country’s IDA allocation. Up to this point, the Bank had tacitly accepted to play a
secondary role, while UNDP and ADB were the leading multilateral agencies in the country. Responding
to the country’s request, the Bank provided US$36.7 million in financial assistance in FY04, bringing
total IDA commitments to US$lOl million. In FYOS, with the approval in March 2005 o f the
Decentralized Rural Development Project (US$7.0 million), Bhutan exhausted i t s IDA allocation for the
first time.49
17.
The CAS period was notionally set until FY02 to allow the Bank to adjust its strategy to the
9FYP I PRSP. Although completion o f the agreed PRSP cover note took longer than anticipated, the Bank
should have prepared a CAS Progress Report to respond to the evolving circumstances. Nonetheless,
although not formalized, a shift in strategy has taken place. The emerging strategy recognizes the above
constraints, and attempts to balance lending with non-lending services, particularly just-in-time analysis
and technical assistance more sensitive to capacity constraints. Through its lending, the Bank has
continued its focus on education and infrastructure, while disengaging from direct support to forestry,
where it had been engaged since 1984.
CAS Outcomes: Progress and B a n k Contribution
1 8.
Improving Macroeconomic Policy and Public Expenditure Management. Underpinned by
sound macroeconomic management, Bhutan enjoyed during the CAS period an average annual growth o f
6.5 percent and low inflation. Although it has become increasingly difficult, for the most part the Royal
Government has followed its policy o f financing recurrent expenditures from domestic revenue and
capital investments through external financing and specifically grants. More progress i s required on
budget preparation and public expenditure management, areas where the Bank expected to contribute
more substantially than it did. However, engagement in these areas has been successfully started recently
through provision of technical assistance. As part o f this effort, the RGoB prepared a preliminary Medium
Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) as a first step towards making multi-year rolling budgets operational.

19.
Supporting Education Sector Development. Bhutan has made excellent progress in improving
access and quality o f education. In the last five years alone, overall enrollment at all levels o f education
(primary, secondary, and tertiary) has increased nearly 50 percent. In primary education, according to the
Ministry o f Education, gross primary enrollment reached 84.2 percent in 2003, a substantial increase from
1991, when it was 55 percent.” Girls’ enrollment ratio also improved, increasing from 39 percent in 1990
to 47 percent in 2003. The country’s successful efforts in education have been supported consistently by
the Bank, in partnership with the Swiss Development Corporation (SDC).
20.
I n line with the CAS, the Bank continued to be one o f the largest donors in this sector between
FYOO and FY05. While the second IDA-financed education project (US$13.7 million) was s t i l l being
implemented, the Bank approved in August 2003 the Education Development Project (US$3 1 million),
which constitutes about one-third o f total IDA lending to the country. Through these projects, the Bank
has helped finance capital investments, particularly construction o f primary and junior high schools. At
the same time, the Bank has contributed to other education improvements by supporting in-service
teacher training, continuous assessments, and improved learning processes. Under EDP, the Bank i s also
supporting the initial efforts to promote higher education, including the establishment o f a national
university system.

49

Due to IDA 13 constraints, the Bank could not actually meet in full Bhutan’s request for financial assistance in FY05.
GER in primary education i s estimated at 93 percent in the BLSS (2003).

21.
Strengthening Health Sector through HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention and Treatment. Over
the past two decades, Bhutan has made remarkable progress in improving the health status o f its
population. From 1984 to 2000, infant mortality has declined from 102.8 deaths per 1000 live births to
60.5 in 2000, and under-five mortality from 162.4 to 84. Furthermore, maternal mortality has seen a
considerable decrease, with the ratio declining from 7.7 per 1000 live births to 2.6. Control of
communicable diseases has also seen significant successes - at present, prevalence o f leprosy remains
low, TB cure rate high at 90 percent, and polio not reported since 1986. Bhutan, however, faces emerging
problems and issues in the health sector, such as increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases
and the spread o f HIV/AIDS. In this respect, the 9FYP / PRSP identified HIV/AIDS and STD prevention
and control as one of the country’s most important programs within the overall objective o f addressing
emerging health issues of the population at large, and of promoting healthy outcomes o f women and
adolescents.
22.
Responding to the priorities of the 9FYP / PRSP, the Bank commenced support to the sector with
the Board approval in June 2004 of the HIVIAIDS and STI Prevention Project, financed with an IDA
grant of US$5.8 million. This assistance complements the larger support from the Government o f India
(GoI) and DANIDA, which are the largest donors in the health sector, and i s contributing to the overall
expansion of health infrastructure and services in Bhutan. Through the IDA-financed project, the Bank i s
helping implement prevention interventions, including STI treatment, providing antiretroviral therapy to
people living with HIVIAIDS, strengthening the Public Health Laboratory and the Blood Bank,
enhancing the capacity of the Dzongkhags to manage and implement prevention and care programs, and
improving the information base through surveillance and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).
23.
Improving Forestry Management. The Bank has supported Bhutan’s efforts to develop an
approach for sustainable protection, management, and use o f its forestry resources since the mid-l980s, in
partnership with SDC, mainly through lending, and more recently, an institutional development facility
(IDF) grant to implement the Forestry Institutional Development Initiative. Consistent with its concern
with environmental protection, Bhutan has carefully managed the commercial exploitation of its forest
resources. During the CAS period, the country’s forest area actually increased, reaching about 72 percent
o f the country’s territory. Social forestry, piloted with IDA support during the CAS period, has been
mainstreamed under the 9FYP. The IDF grant helped promote the organization o f the private sector under
the Wood-based Industries Association.

24.
In contrast, as noted by OED, the Bank has not contributed as much as envisaged to help move
forward the national reform agenda o f the forestry sector. This limited result appears to have been
affected by the sub-national focus o f the three projects so far supported by IDA and inadequate attention
to some aspects o f the policy dialogue. Further progress i s critical since Bhutan faces the challenge of
achieving and maintaining the delicate balance between conserving its forestry resources and tapping into
their economic potential, particularly given the need for economic diversification.

25.
After the third IDA-financed forestry project was completed at the end o f FY02, RGoB decided
not to continue seeking forestry sector-specific support from the Bank. A more integrated, cross-sectoral
approach i s sought through the renewable natural resources management plan included in the 9FYP.
Although no formal sector work has been conducted recently, the Bank completed an informal review.
The findings from the latter, however, have not been disseminated.
26.
Supporting Urban Development. Urbanization i s taking place rapidly in Bhutan, and the two
main cities - Thimphu and Phuentsholing- are growing fast. In this respect, the Bank agreed to support
the Royal Government’s efforts to promote decentralizationand ensure balanced regional development by
helping finance infrastructure improvement in 10 towns, including provision o f water supply and solid
waste management. While Bank assistance i s contributing the promotion o f a more balanced urban

Attachment 6: CAS Completion Report
Page 7 of 19

56

growth, this i s a major challenge that requires a clearer national strategy and policy, in addition to further
investments. A major challenge has been to ensure sustainability o f outcomes derived from Bank support
through adequate operation and maintenance (O&M). However, user charges for infrastructure services
are being introduced for the first time in most o f the targeted towns, which will help set up more
sustainable O&M arrangements.

27.
Improving Rurai Access. Road access i s critical to poverty and development in Bhutan. The
difficult terrain, the scattered population, and strong environmental policy make expansion and
maintenance o f the road network challenging. During the CAS period, and for the f i r s t time, the Bank
contributed to improving access and reducing transport costs by helping finance new rural access roads.
The ongoing project, with co-financing from the Netherlands, i s expected to benefit about 25,000 people.
I n addition, this effort helped promote environmentally friendly road construction (EFC) techniques that
are now applied to all feeder roads in the country. More specifically, a recently completed socioeconomic
impact assessment o f the ongoing project shows that significant economic and social benefits have
already been realized as a result o f the Bank-financed roads. Some relevant indicators are: (a) transition
from portaging and animal transport to motorized transport, resulting in a significant reduction in travel
time and transportation costs. In Dakpai-Bhuli road, for example, travel time was decreased from two
days to two hours and transport cost on key commodities reduced by 40 to 60 percent after the road was
open; (b) diversification o f agricultural products, from mostly cereal and rice production to potato,
vegetables, and fruits; (c) improved access to better health care, especially in the use o f emergency
vehicles (ambulances) and evacuation o f sick people to adequate healthcare facilities; and (d) increase in
roadside shops and promotion o f new income-generating opportunities.
Overall Assessment o f Country Prouam Performance

28.
In line with OED’s assessment, the overall outcome o f Bank assistance i s considered moderately
satisfactory. I n general, Bank impact could not be expected to be substantial given the limited role o f IDA
in Bhutan. Impact, however, varies across areas and sectors. The Bank responded in a timely manner to
the Royal Government’s request for assistance to deal with HIV/AIDS. As such, policy advice and the
availability o f IDA grant funding translated into concrete efforts to scale up the response to HIV/AIDS in
the country, and progress i s being made toward the outcomes supported by the IDA-financed operation.
While in education the Bank i s likely to have had a substantial impact, its impact in forestry i s more
modest and with more mixed results. The Bank has contributed to helping improve forest management in
general, and to promoting community involvement in forest protection and exploitation. On the other
hand, the Bank-supported effort to introduce financially self-sustaining forestry in Bhutan did not produce
the expected results. This, however, was partially due to changed market conditions after RGoB banned
the export o f unprocessed logs and semi-finished products in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Bank analysis
and advice on forestry pricing and marketing, although sound, had little impact on policy. The Bank
started to support urban development in FYOO, and impacts on this area will soon be visible. Some
inroads were made in supporting private sector development through analytical services, including the
Private Sector Survey (2002), which provided inputs for the 9FYP/PRSP, and FIAS’ support to develop
foreign direct investment (FDI) legislation. IFC and SEDF, created to provide support to small and
medium enterprise development, have been quite active since Bhutan became a member o f IFC in
December 2003, but i s s t i l l early to see measurable results from their activities.

Portfolio Assessment
29.
Although the FYOO CAS did not include a specific lending program, lending during the CAS
period was relatively substantial in response to the evolving needs o f the country (see Table B). Despite

Attachment 6: CAS Completion Report
Page 8 of 19

57

the increase in net commitments, IDA remained a relatively small player in Bhutan: as o f March 2005,
total IDA net commitments amounted to US$80 million and undisbursed funds to US$58 million. During
the CAS period, financial assistance was provided in two “batches” supporting activities under the 8FYP
and 9FYP / PRSP, respectively.As agreed during CAS formulation, two projects were approved in FYOO:
Urban Development (US10.8 million) and Rural Access (US$l1.6 million). Due to the circumstances
noted above, two projects were approved in FY04: Education Development (US$3 1 million), the largest
credit ever given to Bhutan, and HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention (US$5.7 million, IDA Grant). A new
credit for US$7.0 million to support decentralized rural development was approved in March 2005. In
addition, IFC approved an investment loan for US$lO million in December 2003, soon after Bhutan
became an IFC member. The Bank also provided several Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grants to
help strengthen forestry sector institutions, financial management and accounting capacity of government
officials, and the pension system.
30.
The small size of the portfolio (3 to 4 active projects on average) makes some o f the indicators
used by the Bank to monitor and assess portfolio performance difficult to apply in Bhutan’s case. Simply
put, every project counts in Bhutan. This i s best exemplified in the “country record flag” added to the
portfolio by QAG in January 2004 given that the net disconnect and unsatisfactory commitments in
Bhutan exceeded QAG established thre~hold.~’
Bhutan’s figures for both indicators, however, reflect the
fact that the .only project (Third Forestry Project, US$5.2 million) o f the country portfolio that has closed
in the past five years was given a moderately unsatisfactory rating on project outcome by OED, while in
the last PSR, the supervision team gave it a marginally satisfactory rating. As a result, the portfolio ended
up in FY02 with 100 percent of projects existing with unsatisfactory outcome and 100 percent disconnect,
and by extension with 100 percent o f commitments under unsatisfactory projects in the last five years.
3 I.
In general, portfolio risk indicators remained close to and were occasionally better than regional
and Bank averages. In FY03, however, the Urban Development Project became a “problem project” for
several months due to unsatisfactory implementation progress. Since the portfolio was comprised of three
projects at the time, this meant that over a third of the portfolio was at risk.

32.
The annual disbursement ratio was always close to or above 20 percent, but this aggregate figure
hides differences in disbursement performance at the project level. Reflecting increased commitments,
annual average disbursements increased substantially during the CAS period. Specifically, from an annual
average of US$1.2 million (or about US1.8 per capita) during the 1990s, gross disbursements rose to
US$5.3 million (almost US7.0 per capita) between FY00-04. In fact, FY04 i s a record year with gross
disbursements o f US$8.1 million and a disbursement ratio of 39 percent. On the other hand, several
projects suffered from a slow disbursement pace. In the case o f Rural Access Roads and Urban
Development in particular, barely 45 o f credit funds were disbursed during four years o f implementation.
The disbursement pace of these projects has improved, and the closing date o f Rural Access Roads
extended to ensure achievement o f development objectives.

33.
As shown in Table C, the delivery o f non-lending services was limited compared to the high
expectations implicit in the CAS, but the Bank provided some useful advice and informal analysis on
several key issues. Two formal reports were completed in FY02, including a Private Sector Survey in
collaboration with UNDP and the Bhutan Chamber o f Commerce and Industry (BCCI), and the Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) with support from the Government o f Netherlands. Other
AAA envisaged in the CAS was completed by other agencies @e., the Poverty Analysis and the Financial
Sector Study, both of which were completed by ADB) or started later than expected (Public Expenditure
According to QAG, a country record flag i s given when a portfolio experiences a net disconnect o f 20 percent or more, or
when net commitments associated with unsatisfactory projects (as rated by OED) represent more than 40 percent o f
commitments for completed projects over the previous five years.

58

Management). O n the other hand, the Bank provided u s e f i l advice on several issues such as exchange
rate regime, recurrent costs and budgetary methods, and civil aviation, and i s completing an M D G
assessment. The Bank also completed several informal reports, including an analysis o f the
macroeconomic impact o f the hydropower export boom (FY02) and a transport sector review (FY04).

34.
Average cost o f CAS implementation (lending, AAA, and supervision) falls within the regional
and Bank norms. Supervision may seem higher in several years, but arguably s t i l l below what would be
needed to intensify this effort in Bhutan, where the Bank has a small and challenging portfolio and lacks a
local office (see below). In this respect, OED concluded that administration o f the Bhutan program was
efficient.
Quality o f Products and Services

For the most part, IDA-financed projects in Bhutan have had a satisfactory outcome, and
contributed to institutional development, even though sustainability o f project benefits has not always
been certain.52 In addition, according to OED, the lending program in Bhutan has been client-driven and
respectful o f the country’s development vision and cultural values. Most projects have been supported
through an effective collaboration with other development partners, which allowed the government to
maximize IDA financing for physical infrastructure and use o f grant funding for the necessary technical
assistance.

35.

36.
A major factor affecting project outcomes was weak project implementation. The latter, however,
i s not only the result o f country capacity constraints and specific geographic and market circumstances,
but also weak Bank supervision, and in some cases, inadequate project design. In general, the Bank was,
and still i s constrained by not having a local office in the country and the difficulty in building a cohesive
Country Team. More specifically, the small size o f the program made it difficult to ensure staff continuity
and focused attention o f management, and by extension, to build a cohesive country team. Moreover, the
geography o f the country demands time and resources not often available to the Bank to ensure even
supervision across project sites. At the same time, the country program did not have a dedicated
operations adviser until very recently and an in-country and in-depth portfolio performance review has
never been conducted.

37.

Overall project delays also reflect limited capacity o f government, especially at the local level,
and o f private sector contractors. Moreover, scarcity o f local traditional construction materials andor
labor often resulted in construction delays.53 The situation was made more critical by the Royal
Government’s concern with adding staff i n line ministries and agencies, even as consultants, to cope with
the increased demand for design and supervision o f civil w0rks.5~In addition, s t a f f transfers occurred
frequently, while civil service rules have tended to delay the filling up o f project-related positions. Not
surprisingly, all projects under implementation during the CAS period suffered implementation delays,
and project closing dates extended in several cases.

38.

Weak capacity also affected monitoring and evaluation (M&E) o f project outcomes, although the

recent project in education reflects an increased effort to strengthen this important area. Implementing the

As noted above, the only project completed during the CAS period -the Third Forestry Project - was rated by OED as having
a moderately unsatisfactory outcome, in addition to having modest institutional development impact and uncertain
sustainability.
53 In this respect, the new education project i s helping to introduce a new building technique that will accelerate construction
while maintaining the traditional details o f schools.
54 This concern i s also related to the long standing policy o f using IDA financing for capital investments, and grants for technical
assistance.

52

Attachment 6: CAS Completion Report
Page I O of 19

59

M&E systems envisaged in the Bank-financed projects was, and remains, challenging, especially given
the scarcity o f baseline data and need for increased data analysis and impact evaluation capacity.
39.
Under the above circumstances, OED correctly identifies on the part of the Bank some
“insensitivity to size” regarding project requirements. As in other countries, Bhutan’s small civil service
could not easily cope with Bank requirements, especially for reporting, financial management, and
procurement. I t did not help, moreover, that quality o f Bank supervision was uneven, partialIy due, as
mentioned above, to the high turnover o f project teams and task managers, but also because o f the
difficulty in visiting all project sites and in following up on critical issues.55 I n turn, limited government
capacity and weak supervision have affected (i) quality control o f civil works, which i s critical
considering that local contractors are also limited in their skills, and (ii)sustainability o f operation and
maintenance (O&M) arrangements.
40.
The quality o f AAA in Bhutan is difficult to assess due to the very small samples analyzed by
QAG or OED. In general, although limited in its impact at the level o f government policy, OED agrees
that the Bank’s Economic and Sector Work (ESW) in Bhutan has been effective in several respects. These
include helping inform Bank management and development partners on country issues, and helping to
make strategic decisions on Bank assistance. The main weakness in terms o f ESW, according to OED, i s
the lack o f formal sector work to inform Bank lending and policy dialogue. Knowledge in such sectors as
the private sector, transport, education, and forestry was nevertheless deepened during CAS
implementation. In the case o f education in particular, sector knowledge has been accumulated through
project-financedstudies.
Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination

41.
The FYOO CAS was prepared following an adequate level o f consultations with Government and
civil society in Thimphu and rural areas, including country team staff from different sectors. In addition,
two extensive field visits were conducted by Bank anthropologists to understand better the social and
ethnic context o f Bhutan. As noted earlier, development planning in Bhutan follows a highly participatory
process, which facilitates the identification of needs and priorities o f different stakeholders.

42.
During the CAS period, RGoB continued to coordinate external technical and financial
assistance, based on its sense o f development priorities and of the comparative advantage of its
development partners. To keep coordination efforts manageable, particularly given the small size o f the
civil service, the Royal Government has endeavored to limit the overall number o f donors in the country
and in individual sectors. In this respect, it has organized, with help from UNDP, eight roundtable
meetings with development partners. Two o f these meetings were held during CAS implementation: In
November 2000 in Thimphu and in February 2003 in Geneva. The latter was particularly relevant, since
it provided RGoB and donors with the opportunity to review the progress made during the 8FYP and to
discuss the development priorities and financing requirements of the 9FYP. UNDP, at the same time,
facilitates coordination by holding meetings among donors resident in Thimphu, and when requested,
meetings of concerned donors with missions o f non-resident multilateral agencies such as the Bank.
43.
The Bank coordinated i t s efforts by working with development partners and following the
division o f labor promoted by RGoB. Accordingly, I D A supported capital investments while the
concerned development partners - SDC, the Netherlands, and Helvetas from Switzerland in particular -

For instance; the Third Forestry Project had six different Task Managers, the Urban Development has been managed by three
so far, and the Education Development Project had three during project preparation and has had two since implementation
started.

cases, however, the Bank did not acknowledge the role of i t s development partners appropriately or pay
sufficient attention to their concerns during project implementation. In general, although Bank relations
with other donors are generally positive, the Bank did not always keep donors informed of strategic
decisions that concerned them. Moreover, the Bank should have had a closer dialogue with ADB, which
has a very active involvement in the country, and the Government of India - the largest single donor.

E.

Main Lessons for New CAS Design and Implementation

44.
The lessons discussed in this section and Table A are consistent with the Country Assistance
Evaluation (CAE) completed by OED in June 2004 and direct stakeholder feedback. I t i s generally agreed
that Bhutan has made substantial social and economic progress following i t s distinct development
approach. It i s also clear that country ownership of the development agenda has contributed to this
progress and that the Bank, in close collaboration with development partners, should continue to support
this agenda and i t s underlying principles. On the other hand, as a relatively small player in a small
country, the Bank finds itself in a challenging position in Bhutan, particularly considering the increasing
need expressed by RGoB for technical and financial assistance.

45.
To respond effectively, the new CAS will need to emphasize flexibility, selectivity, partnerships
with other donors, and an intense dialogue with government. These principles were implicit in the FYOO
CAS, although not always closely followed. Increased sensitivity to the constraints faced by Bhutan
regarding Bank requirements, which should be reflected in reliance on country systems coupled with
capacity building without diluting fiduciary obligations, will be critical to facilitate achievement o f CAS
outcomes. Adapting to small country constraints should be facilitated by ongoing Bank-wide changes
related to the new approach to policy-based lending, simplification o f the investment lending process, and
harmonizationefforts.
46.
Flexibility is critical to respond to evolving client demands, but it should be balanced through
selectivity and a clear recognition of the limited IDA and Bank staff resources available to deliver
assistance to Bhutan. Respectively, the Bank should limit its engagement to a few areas, sectors and
programs. This strategic decision will help enhance development impact, as demonstrated by the results

achieved through the continued engagement in the education sector.

47.

I t is critical to avoid supply-driven assistance, particularly non-lending services that are
considered “mandatory” by the Bank but its usefilness is not filly understood or accepted by the

government. Going forward, the Bank should undertake a concerted effort to make government
counterparts fully aware o f what it has to offer regarding non-lending services, as well as o f the

usefulness and potential benefits of certain Bank products. In general, the approach to AAA should be
low key and relatively informal and cognizant o f capacity constraints, while giving non-lending technical
assistance a’more programmatic and prominent role. Simultaneously, as pointed out by OED, the Bank
should deepen its knowledge of those sectors where it plans to become engaged during CAS
implementation. Overall, the Bank should endeavor to integrate better AAA with lending and technical
assistance to enhance its impact, while making AAA more collaborative by engaging government
counterparts in preparation and dissemination and exploiting opportunities for donor collaboration.
Increased policy advice and analysis, through demand-driven work and sustained dialogue, i s a specific
area that would help enhance the Bank’s development effectiveness in Bhutan.

56

The Bank did not succeed in partnering with Helvetas in the financing o f the Education Development Program due to delays in
project preparation.

48.
The recent fluctuations and emerging trend of reduced frows in external financing upon which
Bhutan relies heavily indicate the need for stronger donor coordination. The Bank does not necessarily

need to take the lead in all the sectors it agrees to support, and should be willing to play a complementary
role whenever possible. Co-financing has been used successfully in the past and should be encouraged
during CAS implementation. As previous experience shows, co-financing - and other types o f financial
arrangements among a group o f development partners and the government - enhances coordination,
brings i n additional expertise, and strengthens supervision.

49.
The above conclusions indicate that it i s advisable to (a) have annual discussions on the country
program to ensure adequate response to changing circumstances; (b) maintain an open-ended A A A
program, supported by unallocated funds to respond to government request for policy and analytical
advice in a timely fashion; (c) strengthen communication with development partners, and maintain close
contact with those that have a field presence; and (d) to develop a clear strategic approach to co-financing
or other modalities o f donor support that allow maximum leverage o f technical and financial resources.
50.
A major challenge for Bhutan i s to measure development results, especially given the lack o f
reliable data and the need to build in country capacity for M&E. A tremendous effort lies ahead for the
government, especially after the census o f population i s completed. At both country program and project
levels, the Bank needs to improve efforts to measure results through better M&E systems, emphasizing
outcomes rather than inputs and processes, and ensuring adequate funding to implement these systems.

that: (i) financing requirements for
the country’s development
program would exceed the public
sector’s own resources (e.g., from
taxation and other revenues) and
expected domestic borrowing; and
(ii)the financing o f foreign

Taxes and duties. Are there any
taxes and duties that the bank
would not finance?

Yes

None

RemarksiExplanation
In individual projects, funding from government
3r from other sources will be generally
encouraged, in order to leverage Bank resources
and take advantage o f partnership opportunities.
The Bank may finance 100 percent o f all project
I program costs where needed and appropriate.
The Bank will continue to monitor the
aggregate fiscal position and prospects and its
implications for recurrent cost financing. I n
determining Bank financing o f recurrent costs in
individual projects, the Bank will take into
account sustainability issues at the sector and
project levels, including implied future
budgetary outlays. Bank financing o f recurrent
costs i s expected to remain within the modest
ranges o f recent years.
The two requirements are met. The Bank may
finance local costs (on investment projects) in
the proportions needed in individual projects.

Taxes and duties are considered reasonable and
non-discriminatory. The Bank may finance
taxes and duties associated with project
expenditures. The application o f this general
approach will be subject to ongoing monitoring
of Bhutan’s tax policy and i t s implementation in
Bank projects. At the project level, the Bank
would consider whether taxes and duties
constitute an excessively high share o f project
costs.

Summary Background Note

1,

.

Cost Sharing. The following approach will be taken to cost sharing in Bhutan:

In individual projects, information on the borrower’s use o f own resources to fund i t s
development program for the sector concerned will be taken into account.

Attachment 9: Country Financing Parameters
Page 2 of 3

IDA’S overall financing envelope will not change. In individual projects, funding from
government or from other sources will be generally encouraged, in order to leverage Bank
resources and take advantage o f partnership opportunities. This funding, however, need not be
provided in each case (see below).
I n cases where sources of financing are not readily available to co-finance a program, the Bank
may finance 100 percent o f all project / program costs.
This approach w i l l be implemented in three ways: (i)within the CAS framework, the Bank w i l l
discuss with Government on an annual basis the upcoming projects in the pipeline, and agree on
tentative financing contributions for these projects; (ii)cost sharing will be discussed at the
Project Concept Note (PCN) stage after consultation with the government; and (iii)current
operations may be reviewed and retrofitted on a case-by-case basis where appropriate.
All o f these actions will be framed within the overall IDA allocation for Bhutan, and the
understanding that decisions to finance fully a given project may have an impact on the size o f
future IDA credits, and/or on the number o f projects to be financed by the Bank.

Following the approach described above, the Bank may finance up to 100 percent o f the costs o f
2.
individual projects. At the individual project level, financing (from other than IDA) may come from
RGoB, beneficiaries, third party international donors and financiers, or when feasible, from local
governments. These contributions do not need to be provided on a matching payment-by-payment basis.
The Bank will be able to finance the full amount o f specific expenditures, rather than a pro-rata share o f
all (or nearly all) project expenditures. These measures w i l l streamline project budget releases and
payment processes and allow project managers to focus on the technical aspects o f project
implementation. Thus, from both an aggregate project cost point o f view, and from the project
implementation perspective, greater flexibility in financing project costs will help projects to meet their
development objectives.

3.
Recurrent Costs. Development programs typically involve both capital investment outlays and
recurrent costs, such as expenditures on salaries or operation and maintenance (O&M). RGoB has
followed a policy o f financing recurrent expenditures from domestic revenues, and capital investments
from external financing, including IDA. (Only recently, and under the IDA grant for HIV/AIDS
Prevention, the Government decided to use a small amount o f IDA funds for operating costs o f the PIU).
The Government, however, has expressed interest in exploring Bank financing o f recurrent expenditures,
but in a manner consistent with their prudent fiscal stance. As discussed earlier, the overall fiscal and debt
situation and prospects are considered reasonable. Moreover, according to OED reports, most Bankfinanced projects in Bhutan have had reasonable sustainability prospects.
4.
While no specific limit i s proposed for the financing o f recurrent costs in individual operations,
this type o f financing i s expected to stay broadly within modest ranges. Recurrent cost financing w i l l also
be decided by considering sustainability issues at the sector and project levels, including implied future
budgetary outlays. At the same time, the Bank will continue to monitor the aggregate fiscal position and
prospects and i t s implications for recurrent cost financing.

5.
Local Cost Financing. A major proportion o f the country’s capital expenditure i s financed by
external assistance. Local expenses comprise a relatively high proportion o f project expenses in Bhutan,
and Bank financial support for these local costs i s critical to the viability o f such projects. Specifically,
about 93 percent o f total disbursements between FY99 and FY04 were for local expenditures. Given the
geographical terrain and other conditions specific t o Bhutan, foreign expenditures are a relatively small
part o f the overall project cost.

80

Attachment 9: Country Financing Parameters
Page 3 of 3

6.
The Bank has traditionally financed local expenditures at a lower percentage than foreign
expenditures. Since the two requirements for Bank financing o f local costs are met, it i s proposed that
foreign and local expenditures be treated in the same way with regard to Bank financing. This approach
should provide greater flexibility and reduced administrative burden for a large number o f Bhutan’s
development projects.
Financing Taxes and Duties. Overall, Bhutan’s tax system i s relatively efficient and reasonable
7.
compared to other lower income countries. Bhutan collects most o f its revenue from corporate income
tax, sales taxes, dividends (hydropower), and grants. As in other countries, tax administration in Bhutan
needs to be further strengthened, and development partners are supporting the Royal Government’s
efforts in this area. The Ministry o f Finance issues tax policy guidelines. The tax rates are approved by the
National Assembly of Bhutan. The Department o f Revenue and Customs (DRC) frames the
administrative rules and regulations, and implements the tax policies. Tax collection responsibility i s
decentralized to the district (dzongkhag) and further down to the block (gewog) levels. In general,
however, the capacity to conduct full tax assessments and collections in DRC and other levels o f
government needs to be expanded.

8.
There are no taxes or duties that have been identified as unreasonable or discriminatory.
Although the sales tax rate ranges between 0 and 50 percent, the latter rate only applies to non-essential
items including alcohol, tobacco, and cigarettes. Sales tax i s paid at the point o f entry (mainly the border
city o f Phuentsholing) by importers, with the exception o f hotel services, cable services, movies, beer, and
cement to which the tax i s applied at the point o f sale. The simple average o f the sales tax in Bhutan falls
between 5 to I O percent, and the effective sales tax i s likely to be lower because most products imported
fall either within the definition o f essentials (e.g., food items, which have a tax rate o f 0) or raw materials
for industries which are exempted altogether.
9.
Customs duty ranges from 0 to 100 percent, but the latter only applies to tobacco products,
alcohol, vegetable oils, and antiques. As noted in the Table above, the average tariff rate i s 24 percent.
Imports from India are not subject to customs duty (although some are subject to sales tax) thanks to the
free trade agreement between India and Bhutan. Imports from third countries are subject to both customs
duty and sales tax. This i s relevant since India i s Bhutan’s largest trading partner, accounting on average
for about 90.percent o f Bhutanese exports (with power as the largest export item) and about 80 percent o f
imports. Moreover, the Bhutanese ngultrum i s pegged to the Indian rupee, and Bhutanese imports from
India are payable in rupees. Bhutan also has a preferential trade agreement with Bangladesh, i t s second
largest trading partner, which provides for duty concessions on a range o f negotiated product lines.

10.
i n general, irrespective o f the source o f financing, all projects are treated in the same way for
taxation purposes and no distinction i s made between Government financed projects and Bank financed
projects. Bank financed projects are therefore subject to the same tax rates as are applicable to all other
projects that are implemented in Bhutan.
11.
Given the above circumstances, the Bank may finance taxes and duties associated with project
expenditures. The application o f this general approach w i l l be subject to ongoing monitoring o f Bhutan’s
tax policy (e.& through non-lending TA) and i t s implementation in Bank projects. At the project level,
the Bank would consider whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share o f projects costs.
