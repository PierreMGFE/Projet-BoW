EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
The second part of the Country Assistance Strategy for Ghanapresents the business
strategy for the World Bank Group. It was prepared on the basis of CDF principles. It is not
solely a response to Ghana's developmentagenda because it was formulatedin the light of better
knowledge about the activities of all partners. Part I of this CAS was prepared by the
Government of Ghana. The strategy outlined by the Governmentbalances growth with human
development and empowermentin a way that should enable Ghana to continueto reduce poverty
in the coming years. While the strategy as a whole is considered sound, there are several
elements of concern to staff. Both recent performance of the economy and the external
environment raise doubts about the ambitious 8 percent medium-term growthtarget. Macroeconomic instability is a major risk facing the Government's strategy. Doubtsremain about the
commitment to speedy and transparent processes of divestiture. Management of the program in
education is weak. The Government is perhaps over-cautiousin the speed at which it wishes to
move in decentralization. In the roads sector, there are issues with the overhang of arrears, as
well as a proposed program which appears to be beyond current financial capacity.
2.
The FY98 CAS emphasized four objectives: restoring and sustaining macroeconomic
stability; ensuring a breakthrough in private investment;promoting broad-based social and rural
development; and implementing direct poverty-alleviationmeasures. Considerableprogress was
made under the first objective during 1997-98,but budget performance deteriorated in 1999,
largely because of a worseningin the terms of trade. Ghana is far from a "breakthrough" in
private investment, although non-traditional exports have expanded four-fold since 1994. The
record is mixed on the third objective. Health status has improved and poverty has declined
modestly. However, agricultural growth has not accelerated enough to raise consumption levels
for some regions (North) and groups (food crop farmers). With Bank support,the Government is
implementing direct poverty alleviation measures.
Two aspects of the approach during the previous CAS period went especially well: the
3.
strong effort in the context of the CDF to improve and deepen donor coordination, and the
decentralizationto the Ghana Office.
In spite of the progress in restoring macroeconomic stability and implementing structural
4.
reforms, problems remain. Without additional efforts to resolve them, it will be difficult for
Ghana to achieve its goal of becoming a low middle-income country. The domestic debt burden
is high. The Governmentis in a vicious circle of borrowing to cover domestic debt service - an
untenable situation which crowds out private borrowing and puts upward pressure on interest
rates. Private participation in infrastructure remains limited. It is the Bank staff s views that
more than a decade after starting to divest, relatively little has been achieved. The private sector
doubts the commitment of the Governmentto private sector-led growth. Reflecting these
problems, IFC's portfolio has decreased.
5.

During the upcoming CAS period, several changes in approach are envisaged:

* First, the proposed program is more oriented to the poor and to reducing poverty by
focusing on the areas critical for poor Ghanaians (food crops, land titling) and on increasing their
access to basic services.
*

Second, the program's analyticalbase needs to be recapitalized.

ii

* Third, there should be more effective collaborationwith partners outside the
Government.
* Fourth,the program continues to supportreforns in public sector management,
using it as a vehicle to make progress on legal reform, governance/corruptionand financial
management.
* Fifth, IDA would reduce direct lending for private sector development, while
maintaining a focus on improvingthe legal and regulatory framework. Assuming progress on the
enabling environment and on private sector participation in infrastructure, IFC and MIGA expect
to expand activities.
The portfolio was streamlined during the previous CAS period. In the future, portfolio
6.
management would emphasize: better project monitoring, led by the implementationteam in the
Ghana Office; increasing the proactivity of our Ghanaianpartners; and moving to more
programmatic lending.
7.
The overriding goal of the Governmentof Ghana's Development Strategy for Poverty
Reduction and the support of the World Bank Group is to eliminate hard core poverty. Within
that broad goal, the proposed business strategyof the Bank Group would help the Governmentto:
(i) raise the growth rate of the economy; (ii) redefine the role of the State; and (iii) implement
their strategy more effectively on the ground. Lending of US$490 million over FYO1-03 is
proposed in the base case, consistentwith the indicative IDA allocation for Ghana. The proposed
base case is slightly higher than actual lending (US$454million) in the previous CAS period. In
the high case, proposed lending (US$640million) would be about 40 percent higher than the past.
In the low case, which would apply if fiscal performance deteriorates significantly,lending would
be a third below the previous level.
8.
The proposed core benchmarks are: growth rate, the headcount and gap for extreme
poverty; the infant mortality rate; under-five child malnutrition (rural), and the literacy rate
(female). The CAS matrix includes 10 additionalindicators that are more sector specific. These
indicators have been chosen partly to permit Ghana's progress towards the international
developmenttargets to be monitored. They are the same as those Governmentlisted in Part I to
monitor its poverty reduction strategy.
The main short-run risk is the possible inability of the Governmentto maintain
9.
acceptable fiscal performance and macroeconomicstability in the face of the deterioration in the
terms of trade and pre-election pressures. In the medium term, the main risk is the continued
"under-performance" of the economy relative to the rates of growth and poverty reduction that
could be achieved with the right enabling environment,stronger fiscal performance, and more
attention by the Governmentto the task of ensuring equitable development.

PART II
GHANA- BANK GROUP DEVELOPMENTPARTNERSHIP
INTRODUCTION
1.
The goal set out in Ghana- Vision2020 is for Ghanato increase growth in order to become
a low middle-income country (threshold of US$760 per capita) by the turn of this decade. The
vision calls for a transformation of the economy and society, in order to improve the quality of
life for all Ghanaians, including through equitable distribution of the benefits of development, so
as to achieve fairly balanced regional development and to eliminate gross deprivation and
hard-core poverty. Ghana's developmentagenda and the Government's current priorities are
covered in Part I of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). In addition to the benefits that would
come to the population from higher growth, the Governmenthas outlined several specific
objectives related to poverty reduction which are to:
*
*
*
*

Reduce the incidence of poverty in both urban and rural areas;
Strengthen capabilities of the poor and vulnerable to earn income;
Reduce gender and geographicaldisparities; and
Improve the health and education levels and productivity of the population.

2.
The second part of the Country Assistance Strategy for Ghana presents the business
strategyfor the World Bank Group. This was envisaged when the Comprehensive Development
Framework (CDF) for Ghana was launchedin the Spring of 1999. We realizedthat it was not
consistentwith CDF principles for Bank staff to present the Government's strategy to the
Executive Directors. Rather, it was agreedthat the Government would present its strategy, and
that staff would present to the Executive Directorstheir business strategy for how the World
Bank Group would assist the Governmentto implement its program. The Executive Directors
endorsedthis approach when they discussed the Ghana CDF on May 27, 1999, on the basis of
IDA/SecM99-286,"Comprehensive Development Framework: Ghana Pilot - Updating Note."
Other development partners, such as the United Kingdom and Canada, have indicatedthat they
will take a similar approach to their country strategy processes, reflecting their involvement in
and commitment to the CDF in Ghana.

In June. the Washington-basedCountry Team and several people from outside the region "brainstormed" to define
issues for the Upstream Review.
The Bank asked an umbrella organization for civil society (CIVISOC). who organized the consultations sponsored
by the Structural Adjustment Participatory Reforrn Initiative (SAPRI), to arrange consultations between the Bank
and civil society. Meetings in six regions took place in November. About 35 persons participated in each two-day
meeting. Participants included people from non-governmental organizations. professional associations, local
governments and small businesses.
The documents prepared by the Government tor the Consultative Group meeting held on November 23-24.1999,
including a First Draft Comprehensive Development Framework Towards (ihana Vision 2020, updated thc
devclopment strategy expressed in Vision 2020, discussed extemal conditions, and laid out the country's priorities.
panicularly for poverty reduction. Sector papers presented in the CDF volume had been prepared by Joint
CGovemment-Donorworking groups. Donors discussed the Government's priorities and outlined their plans for
assistance, Furtherstrengtheningthe base for coordination.
Country Team meetings in January in both Aecra and Washington (including a joint video conferenee) worked on
the details of the issues to be raised in the CAS and the corresponding Bank Group instruments.
Consultations with the Government took place in mid-February at which time we agreed on Parts I and 11wid
reviewed the portfolio. The Bank Group also consulted with the private sector.
IFC staff participated in the Country Team meetings. Both IFC and MIGA took part in the discussions with the
Government and the consultations with the private soctor in mid-February.

3.
The CAS was prepared in a highly consultativeway (see Box ]) and on the basis of CDF
principles. It is not solely a response to Ghana's developmentagenda. It is a business strategy
fornulated in the light of better knowledge about the activities of all partners. The "CDF
pay-off' is that greater selectivity is possible without concern for leaving gaps in support. The
strategy of greater selectivity has influenced the proposed program in several ways. First, in
order to support the private sector more effectively,the role of IDA is differentiatedto focus on
the legal and regulatory framework,while IFC and MIGA intend to expand direct lending and
guarantee facilities for private investors. Their role will be complemented by other donors, for
example, the African Development Bank (agribusiness)and USAID (trade and investment
promotion). Second, the proposed program reflects a decision to move out of those infrastructure
activities in which either private investors are becoming involved (electricity) or other donors are
taking the lead (West Africa Gas Pipeline). Third, the shift to sector-wide programs continues.
In these programs - for 2xample, in the health and roads sectors - donors share responsibilities.
The coordinatedgroup has the ability and resources to provide better policy advicethan would be
the case if IDA were "going it alone." The table in Annex C contains the partner group
arrangements for the CDF and shows that the Bank is not the lead donor in every area in which it
is involved in Ghana. Fourth, the C2DFenablesthe Bank to see more clearly where the role of
other donors may permit it to focus less (basic education) and, conversely, where the lack of
donors implies a need for IDA (urban infrastructure).
A. Staff Assessment of CAS Part .r: "Development Strategy for Poverty Reduction"

4.
The strategy appears to staff to be appropriateto Ghana's circumstances and the document
provides a sound basis on which to discuss the Bank's business strategy.! It balances growth with
human developmentand empowerrnentin a way that should enable Ghanato continue to reduce
poverty in the coming years. It correctly identifies the sources of poverty, and its strongest
feature is the way that poverty is mainstreamedinto sectoral strategies. In particular,there is the
notion of the "poverty sieve": the idea that all sectoral strategies and programs should be judged
explicitly by the extent to which they contribute to poverty reduction. There is a strong emphasis
on rural developmentand the need for balanced growth if the plight of the rural poor is to be
addressed effectively. Given Ghana's limited financial capacity, there are no extensive programs
of social protection. There are small-scale pilot activities supported by developmentpartners.
The poverty program, in terms of expenditure,appears to be feasible, if subject to the
qualifications in paragraph 6 below..
5.
The process of preparing Ghana-Vision2020: Second Step is under way, and the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) is fully integrated into this. Bank support is being provided to
assist this process. It is a sound and broad approach to participation that can be expected to result
in a PRSP that is supported by the population.
6.
While the strategy as a whole is considered sound, there are several elements of concernto
staff, and which are the topic of ongoing dialogue with the authorities. Several of these are
discussed in detail later in this document, but are highlighted here:
* Macroeconomic Performance and Framework. In 1999 economic performance
began well but the effects of the adverse terms of trade were compounded by the fact that
external budgetary support was well below expected levels. Also, it is the Bank staff 's view that
the authorities were slow to react to changing circumstances. Although, as of today, there is not
yet a final agreement on the macroeconomicframeworkfor 2000-2002, the direction which
The Interim PRSP for Ghana will be based on this documentand will be submitted to the Executive Directors of the
Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund. It is expected that the Interim PRSP will provide the basis for a
discussion of a second-year PRGF arrangementwith the IMF, once the final dimensions of the macroeconomic
framework for 2000-2002have been agreed.

3
policies should take has been established, and the Governmenthas completed many of the steps
needed to effect such policies, such as adjustment of taxes. Nevertheless, with the large external
shocks of changes in the prices of cocoa, gold and oil, and with the inevitable fiscal pressures in
an election year, macroeconomicinstability is a rnajorrisk facing the Government's strategy. It
has been explicitly agreed that key poverty-oriented expenditures,such as in the social sectors,
would receive the highest priority in the final fiscal program. Both recent performanceand the
external environmentraise doubts about the ambitious 8 percent medium-term growth target.
Achievement of the target would require a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit to lower real
interest rates and stimulate a higher level of private activity.

* Privatization. In these difficult economic times, accelerating privatization would
seem to be one potential source of revenue enhancement,especially if such revenues could be
used to reduce domestic debt. However, it is Bank staff's view that doubts remain about the
commitment to speedy and transparent processes of divestiture, and a major effort in the dialogue
with the Bank and the IMF will be continued. In particular,we hope to be able to draw clear
links between poverty reduction and privatization,and to ensure that more open processes of
privatization are adopted.
* Education Capacity. The strategy document places appropriate emphasis on
education as key to poverty reduction. There is no disagreement on the core strategies, nor on the
resource allocation. The issue is the effectiveness of expenditures, deriving from weak sector
management. This is agreed by both sides and we are working together to address it. But the
weak capacity remains a risk for the strategy.
Decentralization. It is encouraging to note the importancethat the Government
attaches to governanceissues, especially anti-corruptionand decentralization. Yet, the pace of
decentralizationhas been slow, and the Government is perhaps over-cautiousin the speed at
which it wishes to move. This will continue to be a primary dialogue issue, but also calls for a
major effort in capacity building. It is weak capacity, especially in financial management,that is
the Government's greatest fear in decentralization.
*

*
Roads. This is a sector where notable achievementshave been made with respectto
funding, managementand maintenance. Two key issues remain. First, there is a hangover of
payment arrears from earlier road contracts. Second, the program of expansion presented in the
Government's strategy appears to be beyond current financial capacity. Therefore, it will be vital
for the Governmentto prepare a priority program of road construction and maintenance at a level
well below that proposed in the strategy document, both to avoid a recurrence of arrears, and to
ensure that construction can be carried out effectivelyand rapidly, and without the stop-start
patternsthat have often been observed in the past. This will be the key issue addressed in the
Bank's proposed new Roads Sector Program.

B. Progress Towards Objectives in Previous CAS
7.
When the FY98 CAS was formulated,Ghana was emerging from several years of
macroeconomicinstability. It emphasizedfour objectives: restoring and sustaining
macroeconomic stability; ensuring a breakthrough in private investment,especially exports;
promotingbroad-based social and rural development;and implementing direct povertyalleviation measures. Progress was made under the first objective as fiscal performance improved
substantially in 1997-98. However, budget performance deteriorated in 1999, and continuesto be
under pressure because of the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade and shortfalls in program
assistance. In reference to the second objective, we are far from a "breakthrough" in private
investment,although non-traditional exports have expanded four-fold since 1994. Recent data
indicate a mixed record on the third objective: broad-basedsocial and rural development. Health
status has improved and poverty rates have declined modestly. However, agricultural growth has

4

not accelerated enough to raise consumption appreciably in some regions (North) and groups
(food crop farmers). The Bank is helping the Governmentto implement direct poverty alleviation
measures through a LIL, which includes targeted interventionsfor child nutrition and street
children.
What Worked Well
8.
The Bank's adjustment operations (a one tranche Economic Reform Support Credit in
FY98, followed by a three-tranche ERSO II in FY99) worked effectively to support Ghana's
improvement in fiscal performance, as well as structural reforms - higher electricity tariffs,
reintroduction of the VAT, demonopolizationof external marketing for cocoa, and strengthening
of the banking system. Support to reforms in public spendingalso worked fairly well. The
Medium-TermExpenditureFramework was established. Support to the expansion of access to
safe water and sanitation in rural areas was effective; the share of the rural poor with access to
safe water increased by nearly 50 percent in the 1990s.
Two aspects of the Bank's approach have gone especially well. First, there has been a
9.
strong effort in the context of the CDF to improve and deepen donor coordination, notably
through the creation of the "Mini-CG." The recent in-country Consultative Group Meeting
recognized that considerable improvementshave been achieved in the last two years. This is a
key focus of Ghana's CDF, and is also reflected in the extent to which Ghana's development
partners have been able to move towards programmaticapproaches to assistance in health and
roads. Second, during the period, the Bank rapidly decentralized operationsto the Ghana Office,
which elicited a strong positive response in the 1999 Client Survey.
What Did Not Work Well
10. In spite of better fiscal performance,the domestic debt burden remains a serious problem.
Efforts to reduce expenditureand improve tax administration were not sufficient to reach the
primary surplustarget set out in the last CAS (5 percent) and interest rates did not decline as
projected, leaving the Government:in a vicious circle of borrowing in order to cover domestic
debt service. This is an untenable situation which crowds out private borrowing and puts upward
pressure on interest rates. The Bank erred by financing directed credit despite this poor policy
environment. The Government established the Public Utilities Regulatory and the Energy
Commissions, but the regulatory framework for telecommunications is inadequate, in spite of
Bank support. Private participation in infrastructureremains limited. More than a decade after
starting to divest, only 25 percent of public enterprises (by value) have been privatized. Longstanding Bank support to the process of privatization has not been successful in improvingeither
the quality or the quantity of its achievements. It is the Bank staff's view that the private sector
doubts the commitment of the Government to private sector-led growth.
11. IFC's portfolio decreased during the previous CAS period, due to a lack of large-scale
investments requiring international project finance, notably in infrastructure. IFC's involvement
in other areas, such as finance, was,limited by the sluggish pace of reforms and low levels of
investment. IFC's SME investments and support facilities, however, expanded and were a source
of innovation. In spite of progress on the policy front, in recent years annual FDI inflows to
Ghana averagedonly about US$70 million, low even by African standards. MIGA's perspective
suggests that the reason is not lack of interest (several inquiries and preliminary applications have
been received)but because investors finally decided not to pursue projects. Only three
guarantees are outstanding- all related to one mining equipment company. Insights from MIGA
technical assistance activities suggest that regulatory obstacles are a problem.

Domestic marketing of cocoa is already liberalized.

5
12. The Government has begun to reform public statutory agencies, but the size of the public
service is still bloated. Reforms supported by earlier Bank lending were not sustained. They
were too narrowlyfocused and did not address problems in sufficient depth. More work is
needed to improve public services by refocusing the operational objectives of government
institutions and subvented organizations, including by commercializing(fully or partially) some
agencies. Our efforts in education have not worked well. A tertiary education project closed with
an unsatisfactoryrating becauseof little progress on reforms. Poor quality is a problem and the
public sector could do more to close gaps in school attendancerates between the poor and
non-poor, the North and other regions, the city and the countryside,and boys and girls.
C. Instruments of Bank GroupAssistance
13. During the upcoming CAS period, Sector InvestmentCredits and Adaptable Program
Loans would continue to be used in all areas where capacity, as well as the agreementon
objectives and the future program, support such lending. Proposed program lending (i.e., quick
disbursing budget support) represents about a third of total lending. The following changes in
approach and instruments are envisaged.
* First, the proposed program is more oriented to the poor and to reducing poverty. In
practical termns,this means a focus on areas critical to poor Ghanaians (food crops, land titling)
and on increasing their access to basic services (education,health, water and sanitation) which are
crucial to expanding economicopportunities for them. Within "national" programs, project
design would ensure that underserved, poor areas (the Northern Region and rural areas) receive
priority. In discussions with the Government,the National Development Planning Commission
describesthis as using a "poverty sieve" for each activity in order to enhance the links with
poverty reduction. Poor communitieswill be more involved in project implementation.
Increasing the explicit priority on poverty reduction was a strong recommendation receivedin the
Client Survey. Also, a more consistent and effective strategy to promote decentralizationneeds
to be developed,which focuses on the efficient delivery of key social services. In that context,
there is room to simplifyand rationalize the design of projects being implemented in a
decentralized framework.
* Second, the analyticalbasis of the program needs to be recapitalized, and economic
work would focus more on the potential for non-traditionalexports, as well as on
decentralization. The objective of the FY98 CAS to move in this direction was not possible,not
least since the budget for the Ghana program fell by over 25 percent in this period. The
considerablyrationalized portfolio (see paragraph 14) should now facilitate this shift.
* Third, an objective of the program is to work more, and more effectively, with
partners outside the Government,especially civil society and the private sector, and continueto
deepen collaboration with other development partners through the CDF institutional mechanisms.
This is particularly importantfor governance issues.
Fourth,the program continues to stress the importanceof supportingreforms in
public sector management,using it as a vehicle to make progress on important issues such as
legal reform, governance/corruption,and financial management,including the consistent use of
the Medium-TermExpenditureFramework (MTEF).
*

* Fifth, the IDA program would reduce direct lending for private sector development,
while maintaining a focus on improving the legal and regulatory framework. IDA would reduce
direct financing of infrastructurethat the private sector could finance (e.g., electricity and urban

agribusiness. It is an area where both the African Development Bank and the IFC are active and
can deepentheir involvement. IDA would also move away from direct lending to financial
institutions, reflecting a shift to IFC support in providing term finance, equity and capacity
building.

14. As of January 1, 2000, there were 23 active projects in the Bank's portfolio in Ghana,
totaling US$1003.8 million, of which US$540 million is undisbursed, significantly lower than the
35 projects totaling US$1400 million at the start of the previous CAS period. Portfolio
performance initially deteriorated (partially reflecting more realistic ratings), but has improved
recently. At the end of FY98, there were eight problem projects representing 38 percent of
commitments. At present, there are five problem projects representing about 11 percent of
commitments. Of these, four projects have recently been restructured. The target for end
FY2000 is zero problem projects. Slow disbursements remain a problem. Disbursementlags
were over 33 percent for 12 projects and over 50 percent for eight of them. The Realism Index
improved from 80 to 100 percent during the previous CAS period, while the Proactivity Index,
dropped slightly to 67 percent because of delays in reaching agreementwith the Governmenton
how to restructure projects. The Client Survey criticized the Bank on this point. It is an area
which needs to be improved. On service standards, Ghana's performance during the last fiscal
year was slightly worse than the Bank average, particularlyfor time elapsed between Board and
Effectiveness. Only a third of projects met the four-monthstandard. All projects met the
five-month standard for time elapsed between Appraisal and Board.
15. Future Portfolio Actions. We intend to focus on the following three priorities in order to
improve performance during the upcoming CAS period:
(a)

better and more frequent project monitoring led by the implementation team in the
Ghana Office;

(b)

increasing the proactivity of our Ghanaian partners, especially the Ministry of
Finance, in monitoring the program and addressing problems early; and

(c)

trying to resolve the perennial counterpart funds issue by moving to programmatic
lending, and replacing it with the concept of appropriate levels of sector funding by
the Governmentthrough the Medium-TermExpenditure Framework.

E. Support to Ghana's Development Agenda
Proposed CountryAssistance Strategy
16. The overriding goal of the Governmentof Ghana's Development Strategy for Poverty
Reduction and the support of the World Bank Group is to eliminate hard-core poverty. Within
that broad goal, the proposed business strategy of the Bank Group would help the Governmentto:
(i) raise the growth rate of the economy; (ii) redefine the role of the State; and (iii) implement
their strategy more effectively on the ground.
Increasing Growth
17. Higher growth is key to accelerating poverty reduction in Ghana. In spite of a 15 percent
reduction in the share of the populationbelow the poverty line during the previous decade, about

Estimated

40 percent of Ghanaians are classified as poor and about 30 percent are extremely poor3 The
Government has an ambitious target for economic growth (8 percent per annum), which they
failed to meet during the previous CAS period. If Ghana is to become more successful, it will
have to address with more effort the key constraints to higher growth. First, for the private sector
to become the engine of growth and generate employment, further improvements are needed in
the legal and regulatory framework. Parliament is considering a revised labor code which was
prepared with the assistance of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and is in line with that
organization's guidelines on core labor standards. In other areas as well, the private sector has to
perceive a more attractive investment environment and greater consistency in the application of
policies and regulations (see Box 3). Second, infrastructure bottlenecks need to be alleviated.
Costly transportation is a barrier to agricultural marketing. Power outages are a problem. In
some areas - transportation, power, and water - it will not be possible to expand access and
improve quality without more private sector participation. Progress on both of these fronts would
lower the cost of doing business in Ghana and promote a buoyant private sector.
18. Recent data show that the pattern of growth will, to a great extent, determine whether the
Government is successful in reducing poverty. In spite of a modest decrease in overall poverty in
Ghana during the 1990s, poverty rates either stagnated or increased in the rural coast and
savannah. Food crop farmers need to participate in the expansion of the economy to a greater
extent than they have up to now. During the 1990s, the share of food crop farmers falling below
the extreme poverty line fell only slightly from 50 to 46 percent. Strongly related to that issue,
social and economic disparities between the North and other regions need to be addressed. Given
Ghana's relatively small domestic market, higher growth will have to be led by exports. In the
previous decade, an expansion in traditional exports - cocoa, timber and gold - led growth.
These products will continue to be important, but further expansion must come to a greater extent
from non-traditional products.
19. If growth in Ghana is to be pro-poor, the performance of agriculture must improve by
increasing productivity in food crops and expanding opportunities in commercial crops. The
Bank has long been active in agriculture, but progress has fallen short of the goals, a view also
expressed during the consultations with civil society. This year we will review our performance

The upper poverty line is the equivalentof $1/day, whilethe extreme poverty line (coveringonly minimumcalorie
requirements)is about$0.75/day.

in agriculture by examining the results of five projects which are closing. The main instrumentof
future Bank support is an Agriculture Services APL, an integrated, sector-wide approach to
work with the Government and other donors, to increase productivity by improvingthe efficiency
and impact of supporting services, including research and extension. Current land tenure
arrangements, including for women, hinder agricultural development. These would be addressed
in a proposed Land AdministrationProject. More than half of the workers in agriculture are
women and they are more likely than men to cultivate food instead of cash crops. There is
considerable scope for improving women's agricultural productivity, as well as incomes from
enterprises, simply by improvingtheir access to key inputs needed for production. To that end,
the Agriculture Services APL will give priority to improving access to inputs needed for
agriculturalproduction, developing agricultural extension services that better meet the needs of
small farmers, and improving small-scale agroprocessing and storage techniques.
20. An Economic Report to be completed in CY2000 will analyze the performance,
constraints, and potential for growth in nontraditional exports, many of which are agriculturebased products. In cooperation with IFC and the African Development Bank, a Review of
Agribusiness would be carried out. It could lay the base for more opportunities for IFC
engagement, as well as support from ADB, for whom this is a priority set out in their Country
Strategy paper, which is being prepared in parallel with this CAS.
21. The Bank program would concentrate on helping to establish an appropriate regulatory
framework, assisting the Governmentto expand participation of the private sector in electricity
and water, and alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly in roads. Improvements in the
regulatory environment will be supported through a restructured project (Public Enterprise and
Privatization Technical Assistance) in the existing portfolio, while other unsuccessful private
sector projects are wound down. The one new project proposed in the private sector area
(Gateway II) would follow up on an ongoing activity,which is strengthening supporting services
for export expansion such as customs, trade facilitation, and improvements in transportation. The
ongoing project aims also to support the Environmental Protection Agency in monitoring
compliancewith environmental regulations and standards. MIGA collaborates in project

10

implementationby providing capalcitybuilding for investment generation. The second project
would extend the reach of the service improvementsbeyond the current focus on the free zone.
22. The Bank Group's support to private sector participation in infrastructure would integrate
the services and products available from the Bank, IFC and MIGA. This is already the case in
power (wherejoint activities are in progress) and will be explored in other areas. IFC will
actively seek to finance investments which ensue from the new focus on private participation in
infrastructure, initially in power and telecommunications, where projects are underway. IFC will
also seek to finance investments in urban water, ports and other transportation areas, as those
sectors are opened to private participation. To help implement complex privatizations and
structure private participation, IFC will provide advisory services at the transaction stage, to
complement the Bank's assistance, as it is already doing in power. While a larger role for the
private sector is a key element for economic growth and poverty reduction, experience worldwide
indicates that a sound regulatory fiamework for ensuring that environmental and social
safeguardsare in place is a prerequisite to ensure that such growth is sustainable. Additionally,
in-countrycapacity for monitoring complianceneeds to be assured. With regard to the private
provision of infrastructure and services, the Bank Group support will ensure that appropriate
safeguards are in place, with regard to the integration of environmental and social considerations.
23. The Bank is assisting the Government to restructure the Urban Water system, including
private participation. At the time of writing, however, it is unclear whether the Bank will be
compelled to withdraw from this sector, as the Government plans to award a major contract under
this program in a non-transparent rnanner. If this occurs, the Government has been informed that
the allocated funds in the proposed lending program (FY2001), US$100 million, would be
cancelled from the proposed three-year program. To address the constraints posed by an
inadequate transportation network, the Bank is preparing a Roads Sector Investment Project for
presentationto the Board in late FY2000 or early FY2001. A supplement to help the Government
further expand electricity generaticincapacity is also being prepared for this fiscal year. Possibly,
the Bank would prepare an electricity project to help the Government expand services in poor
areas of less interest to private operators. When, and in which circumstances, we would enter
into such lending would depend on the timing and the outcome of the ongoing efforts to expand
private sector participation in power.
24. It is the Bank staff's view that macroeconomicinstability during much of the previous
decade was a major factor behind (ihana's failure to achieve higher growth rates. The Bank's
main instrumentsto support macroeconomic stability are the recently approved Second Economic
Reforn SupportOperation (ERSO II), policy advice, and new adjustment lending. In view of the
severe deterioration in Ghana's tenns of trade this year, a supplement to the second tranche of
ERSO II is being considered. This will depend on the size of the financing gap as other partners
firm up their intentions, and, more importantly,on the quality and timeliness of the Government's
response to the difficult situation it faces.
25. The high burden of domestic debt - a legacy of past expansionary fiscal policies and
continued high interest rates - is the major obstacle to private sector-led growth. Private
investors cannot access the funds thieyneed given high interest rates and crowding out by
Government borrowing. In order for the Government to get out of the vicious circle it is in now
of borrowingto cover domestic debt service, fiscal performance must improve significantly.
Domestic interest payments were equivalent to a third of discretionary expenditures in 1999. Sale
proceeds from privatizations(power, for example) could be used to reduce the stock of domestic
debt. Better management of the budget, including domestic debt, will be supported under the
second Public Financial ManagementProject, and the Bank will continue to encourage
stronger fiscal performance and progress on privatization, which are program triggers. Program

11

assistance (i.e., quick-disbursingbudget support), such as the new Economic Reform Support
Operations (III and IV) proposed in paragraph 47, also permits the Government to reduce the
burden of domestic financing. We would explore the possibility of structuring this support as
Adaptable Program Assistance.
26. A strong and efficient financial system is necessaryto underpin higher growth, and the
Bank and IFC both have roles to play. The Bank will continue to support improvementsin
financial sector regulation and public sector capacity, while IFC intends to expand its direct
investments in the private sector. Together with other donors, the Bank would participate in a
Rural Finance Project which aims to strengthenrural banks. The ongoing Non-Bank Financial
Institutions Project supports improvements in regulation and supervision of the financial system,
thereby protecting savers, contributors and Governmentfrom costs of institutional failure, as well
as improvementsin payments system linkages, including to the rural (poorer) areas. The IMF,
IFC and Bank would work together on a Financial Sector Assessment(FY2001). Expanded
support to the financial sector is a key part of IFC strategy for Ghana. IFC's targeted areas for
investment include: providingterm resources to commercialbanks for medium-term finance;
helping introduce new financial products; investing equity in start-up ventures, particularly
non-bank financial institutions (life insurance, microfinance);and providing capacity building
and advisory assistance. Three new operations in this area are under preparation. The increased
involvement by IFC in financial institutions involved in microfinance would tend to benefit
women as they dominate trading and retail activities (an expected focus of lending) and are more
likely to participate in small companies.
27. In order to ensure the sustainability of growth, environmental concems need to be
adequately addressed. The key natural resource management issues in Ghana are land and forest
degradation and the loss of biodiversity associated with unsustainable harvesting levels in the
high forest and the savanna, and with inappropriate farming practices. The Bank's main
instrument to support the Government's efforts to ensure sustainable development is the ongoing
Natural Resources ManagementAPL. Its objective is to establish the institutional and policy
framework for implementing ecologically and socio-economicallysustainable management
systems for high forest, savannah woodland and wildlife resources, in collaborationwith local
communities.
28. The Bank has supported water resources managementby coordinating analytical work, as
well as by assisting the Water Resources Commission to participate in a regional study on Volta
Water Resources. The rural water infrastructurecomponent of the ongoing Village Infrastructure
Project aims to promote water conservation practices and the rational use of water for agriculture.
The coastal zone management component aims to promote local capacity and investments for
sound management of the coastal and marine ecosystem, in line with the strategy developed by
the Environmental Protection Agency and the Bank, with support from the GEF and donors.
Effective coastal zone management is likely to influence significantly poverty reduction efforts in
the rural coastal area (which has not benefited as much as other areas from economic growth).
29. Under the ongoing programs supported in mining, the Bank facilitated the privatization of
the state-ownedmines, providing assistance in capacity building and policy dialogue, as well as
in addressingenvironmental, health and safety concerns. Poor provision of urban infrastructure is
also a serious environmental issue in Ghana. This problem is being addressed through existing
projects (Urban Environmental Sanitation and Local GovernmentDevelopment), as well as two
proposed projects: Urban V (Medium-Sized Towns)andGreater Accra Urban Poverty.

12
Redefining the Role of the State
30. As expressed in Ghana-Vision2020, the role of the Government is to efficiently provide
public goods and services and ensure an equitable distribution of the benefits of development.
Two main obstacles are hindering progress. On one hand, the public sector is overextendedin
several areas (cocoa marketing, media, utilities) which are not public goods. To make matters
worse, public sector performance has been poor (utilities, for example),acting as a drag on the
economy. The main factor behind Ghana's relatively low marks on structural reforms, as
measured by several indicators of the World Bank, in spite of its early adjustment program, is
either excessive state involvement in the economy, or the consequences of that involvement(for
example, non-performing loans). It is the Bank staff's view that the main factor which has
limited the disengagement of the state is lack of commitment by the top level of the Government
to go very far. The lack of will is demonstrated by the slow progress and low proceeds from
privatization and political interference in the process. The disengagementthat has occurred has
been piecemeal, not part of a clear, overall strategy. The role of the non-profit private sector
could be enhanced and a more constructiveand proactive relationship promoted between it and
the Government. One obstacle is the lack of a general framework for the participation of nongovernmental organizations.
31. On the other hand, it is widely felt that the Government does not do enough to deliver
public goods and services and ensure equitable development. In key social indicators such as
literacy and school enrollments,Ghana is losing its previousadvantage over other Sub-Saharan
African countries - a trend at odds with its goal of becominga middle-income country. There is
also a wonryingrecent trend of lower utilization of health services. Data on poverty trends
indicate that the benefits of Ghana's moderate growth have not been shared equally by all regions
or groups, particularly the Northern Region and food crop farmers. More effort is needed to
improve the monitoring and evaluation of public programs and policies, including by ensuring
consultations between the public sector and other groups, such as the business community and
civil society at all stages of the process. Many groupsthink that the flow of information
(economic and budget data, for example) to those outside of the Government is insufficient. A
better partnership with the non-profit private sector could help improve the Government's
effectiveness in ensuringequitable development.
32. There are indications that the Government is becoming more willing to disengage from
some activities - cocoa marketing and utilities being importantexamples. The work to improve
the regulatory and legal framework described above will be important to support the
Government's efforts to disengage. In addition, the Bank will continue to promote improvements
in the divestment process, focusing on large enterprises for which decisions have been taken to
privatize key activities (power, urban water, ports, and railways), and where private sector
participation could have a large positive impact on the quantity and quality of services. Better
integration and more strategic use of the instruments of the different Bank group entities (IDA,
IFC and MIGA) are likely to be more effective in encouraging progress than sole involvement of
IDA. IFC advisory services on sector restructuring and privatization in infrastructure, for
example, can be effective in following through with complextransactions, as in power. As this
process moves forward, we foresee the need to update our analytical work on the roles of the
public and private sectors in infrastructure provision in Ghana. The first phase of the
liberalization of external marketing of cocoa is a condition of the ERSO II adjustment loan, and
subsequent phases would be supported in future lending.
33. In order to improve the efficie:ncyand responsivenessof public services, reforms are
necessary in policy formulation,budget accounting, public administration, and monitoring and
evaluation of Government performance. The main instruments for continued Bank support to

13
improvementsin public finance (including better information flow to the public and private
groups) is the proposed Second Public FinancialManagementProject. Though we have no
instrument to address directly the size of the bloated public service, the ongoing Public Sector
ManagementAPL aims at commercializingGovernment operationsand thus indirectly reducing
the number of public servants. In addition, other partners are assisting the Government in this
regard. The social impact of these actions are being examined through a broad participatory and
systematic stakeholder analysis. The results will feed into the design of programs to assist
retrenched workers and their families, and other actions to ensure sustainabilityof the changes.
Reforms at the center must be complementedby a credible decentralizationprocess which
deconcentratesadministrativeand fiscal authority.
34. The Bank strategy envisages support to both educationand health, to help the Government
improve the access to services and outcomes, particularly for poorer groups and regions, and
women. In nonformal education, the Bank supports the Government's literacy program, which
focuses on women and residents of rural areas. While 60 percent of Ghanaians over the age of 15
are literate, this is true for only about a third of women or farmers.
35. During the.upcoming CAS period, the Bank faces two major challenges in education. The
first is the poor performance of basic education, reflected in the unsatisfactorystatus of the
ongoing Basic Education operation. This is being addressed through support to the Ministry of
Education in management and organization,and will be a primary area of focus for all
developmentpartners. At this time we believe it may not be necessary for IDA to program
additional lending in basic education, given the large availability of other sources of funding, and
their current low rate of utilization. However, that judgement would be reexamined if necessary,
in the light of any identified financing gaps in this area once the sector program is better defined
next year.
36. The second challenge is to assist the Governmentto expand access and to improve the
quality of post-basic education. Weak implementationof the Government's educationpolicy was
an importantconcern raised by many during the consultationswith civil society. Although
enrollments in senior secondary schools are growing, still less than 30 percent of Ghanaian
children reach this level, and, whereas the gap in enrollment in basic education between girls and
boys has narrowed significantly,at higher levels the participation of girls drops. In senior
secondary, only about a third of the students are girls and it drops to about a quarter at the tertiary
level. Preparation of support to post-basic education has been delayed because of implementation
constraints in the Ministry of Education. A PHRD grant has been mobilized to address some of
these constraints and to support analytical work. Assuming that those activities can be used to
improve capacity and better define strategies, we hope to be able to prepare two phases of an
Education APL. The first would focus on tertiary educationand the second on senior secondary
schooling.
37. A Second Health Sector Project is planned which would continue the sector-wide support
to health services. The adult HIV prevalence rate in Ghana is estimated to be about 4.6 percent;
incidence rates are two times higher among women than men. HIV remains predominantly in
groups whose behavior places them at high risk, but Ghana's current prevalence rate is on the
threshold of becoming a more generalizedepidemic, in which case the disease would spread
rapidly to the general population. In connection with the ongoing and the proposed follow-up
Health Sector Projects, and in cooperationwith our partners, particularly UNAIDS, the Bank will
assist the Governmentto ensure that an effective multi-sector program is in place to change the
behavior of those at highest risk of contracting and spreadingHIV, and to support better services
for those livingwith HIV/AIDS. In particular,the Bank will try to address one of the gaps in the
response in Ghana- the lack of a mechanism to provide resources to community-basedand civil

14
society groups to undertake activities in this area. In the short run, we may address this by
proposing a supplement to the ongoing Health Sector Investment Credit.4 In addition, we are

examining the scope within the portfolio for restructuring to incorporate programs of education
and prevention, in such areas as the basic education program, agricultural extension and road
building. Opportunities to support these activities would also be sought in new projects. In both
education and health, the private sector plays a significant role, and IFC is actively exploring
projects in these sectors in Ghana. There is potential for expanded participation and for better
collaboration between the private and public sectors. In future analytical and project work, the
Bank will take this into account more. including by taking advantage of IFC's recent increased
involvement.
38. Recent data on poverty trends in Ghana have highlighted the need to focus more on the
impact of public policies and programs on the poor. This is a relatively new priority, as the
disparities among different regions and groups in the past were not as pronounced as they are
now. The Bank will try to improve capacity in this area, including through the recently approved
Community Development LIL, and would begin work towards the end of the CAS period on
scaling up activities supported in that operation. Important links also need to be strengthened
with public finance initiatives, such as the Medium-Term ExpenditureFramework.
39. The Urban V (Medium-SizedTowns) project is designed to address the infrastructure
constraints in the smaller cities of Ghana. This is a poverty-targeted intervention since, with the
exceptionof Accra, poverty levels either stagnated or rose in all other urban areas of the country
during the 1990s. The planned Greater Accra Urban Poverty Project will incorporate specific
mechanisms to target the poorest population, including an emphasis on community participation,
and will be part of the "Cities without Slums" initiative. An important activity to improve
services for the poor is the Second CommunityWater and Sanitation APL, approved by the
Board earlier this fiscal year. The project supports the Governmentof Ghana program to extend
coverageof water and sanitation facilities to 85 percent of the rural population by the year 2009,
and establish a sustainable operations and maintenance system in rural communities. Inadequate
infrastructurefacilities - especially vater supply - greatly curtail women's productivity and
increase their time commitments. Such time constraints hamper most women's ability to manage
farms or other enterprises. Women in rural areas traditionallyplay a strong role in household
water supply and sanitation. The project promotes the involvement of men and women in project
planning and operations and maintenance. There is a requirementthat women sign all
community agreements.
Implementing the Strategy More Effectively

40. Several problems hinder the effective implementation of Ghana's developmentstrategy.
First, although the implementation oi decentralizationof government services and responsibilities
to the district level5 has started, the process is not complete. Most central government agencies
are resisting the decentralization of financial and human resources which is critical to make
decentralization work. In some areas local political authorities and the representatives of central
government agencies are at loggerheads. Second, the systems governing the management and use
of the Government's financial resources are weak in areas such as monitoring actual
expenditures, auditing, and clearly and consistently applying regulations. The expenditures
supporting the Govemment's Development Strategy for Poverty Reduction needed to be linked
closely to the Medium-TermExpenditure Framework. There is a need for simple and transparent
4

As an incentive to the Govemment to clean Iupthe portfolio, we are considering proposing such a supplement in the

same amount as would be canceled in the rationalized operations.
Ghana presently has 110 Districts in its 10 regions. Each district has a minimum of 75,000 residents.

15

systems, including in public procurement. Excessive bureaucracycreates opportunitiesfor
corruption and identified corrupt officials are often not sanctioned. Third, there is mistrust
between Government and civil society. The flow of information is inadequate and there are few
established mechanisms to promote a partnership between Governmentand civil society. In
consultationswith civil society and the business community for this CAS, this came through time
and again as an important area for increased Bank involvement. The citizens of Ghana and
groups outside of the Government can have an effective input into public policy and programs
only if they have a sufficient base of knowledgeand information. We would addressthis
weakness by being more proactive in disseminatingthe results of our analytical work and projects
within Ghana, as well as by using projects to strengthenthe Government's commitment to better
informationflows, as well as its capacity to deliver better service.
41. In the area of decentralization,analyticalwork is planned that would in the first instance
help us and other donors rationalize different approaches to local governmentsand communities.
This work would feed into the next ConsultativeGroup Meeting for Ghana (tentatively scheduled
for late 2001), whose theme is expectedto be decentralization. A DecentralizationAPL would
support implementationof the Local GovernmentService Act which is expected to be sent to the
Cabinet soon. The design of the Urban V (Medium-SizedTowns) APL was modified to be
more demand-driven,thereby encouragingthe transfer of greater responsibilityto local
governments. We would look for other opportunitiesto apply that principle, including by
supporting community action in the upcoming urban project in Accra. Both of these projects (as
well as the ongoing Local GovernmentProject) focus on capacity building at the district level.
The importanceof moving in this direction was highlighted during the consultationswith civil
society.
42. We would help the Governmentaddress weaknesses and corruption in the management
and use of financial resources, including procurement, by putting in place the appropriate legal
and regulatory framework; by assisting Parliament to strengthen its oversized capacity; and by
improvingcapacity through the Public Sector ManagementAPL and Public Financial
ManagementReform II. In cooperationwith WBI, a survey on corruptionwill be carried out.
A ComprehensiveFinancial AccountabilityAssessment,which would identify areas that need
to be improved,is planned later this fiscal year. The Bank would continue to take a strong stand
if corruption is identified in our projects. We also are consideringproviding supportto enhance
the monitoring and evaluation capacity of Government and other stakeholders(for example,
non-profit private sector) through one of the projects mentioned above. WBI (jointly with the
OperationsEvaluation Department of the Bank) also is sponsoringtraining courses on monitoring
and evaluation for public officials and the non-profit private sector.
43. We would also propose to deepen our relationships with organizations outside the
Government. A LIL(s) for Promoting Partnershipswith TraditionalAuthorities would
support opportunitiesto collaboratewith traditional leaders and local government in areas of
common interest such as community involvementin education, land titling, HIV/AIDS
prevention and cultural heritage, recognizingthe influenceof such leaders and their renewed
interest in developmental issues. WBI also has supported activities to strengthenParliament. In
the area of informationdissemination,WBI has sponsored activities to strengtheneconomic
journalism.
F. Size and Composition of Bank GroupProgram
We envisage four to five new projects (including second phases of APLs) a year, totaling
44.
US$490 million over the period FY2001-2003for the base case. The program includes several
APLs, as well as at least one LIL. We anticipatethat in FY2002, assuming good progress, the

16
second stage of the Public Sector Management APL would begin, and in FY2003, the second
phase of both the Natural Resource Management APL and the Community Water and Sanitation
APL would begin.
45. The amounts proposed compare with actual lending of SDR 317 million (US$454 million)
for FY97-99 and an indicative IDA allocation in the LAR for FYO1-03of SDR 365 million
(US$490million). The proposed base case is only slightly higher than past lending levels and
assumes continued adequate fiscal performance. In the event that we reach the high case, our
proposed lending levels would be about 40 percent higher than the past. In the low case, lending
would be a third lower than the previous lending level.
46. The triggers are the public sector borrowingrequirement, portfolio performance,cocoa
reform,private participation in infiastructure, and education sector performance (Table 2). A key
trigger is the extent to which the Governmentmoves forward on the program to increase private
participation in infrastructure. In the event that progress in this area is completely stalled (or not
carried out in a transparent manner), one infrastructureproject, as well as the proposed Gateway
II Project, would drop out of the program. We would follow a low case in the event that the
Government's fiscal performance deteriorated significantly. If this were to occur, the proposed
adjustment loans (totaling US$153 million) would drop out of the program, and the proposed
lending program for the three-year period would fall to US$286 million. Lack of further progress
on the reform of external marketing of cocoa would reduce the amount of adjustment lending. A
summary of the proposed IDA program for the three cases is in Annex B I.
47. Program lending. The Governmentstill has important reforms to deepen in the areas of
cocoa marketing, taxation, trade policy (particularly exemptions) and regulatoryenvironment, if
they are to lay the basis for accelerated private sector and export-led growth. The high domestic
debt-servicing burden, the low level of reserves,Ghana's vulnerability to external shocks, and the
risk that domestic interest rates may be higher than is projected, means that continued program
lending (i.e., quick-disbursingbudget support) is necessary during the next CAS period.
48. IFC. The volume of IFC investments is difficult to forecast as it dependson demand
which emanates from the levels of private investment. However, if pending private infrastructure
projects proceed, IFC would expect to doubleor even triple the current portfolio of approximately
US$40 million. These large infrastructure investments would be complementedby financial
sector investments; investments in competitive sectors such as agribusiness, tourism, and export
manufacturing;and increased activity in IFC's SME support facilities.
49. Continued progress in policy reforms and improvementsin the regulatory environment for
business would be expected to result in significant levels of MIGA guarantee activity.
Preliminaryapplications for coverage received by MIGA over the last year include investor
interest in telecommunications,services, water, power and agribusiness, and their indicative
investmentvalues range from US$10 to US$80 million. In addition, MIGA will continue to
provide technical assistance to the Giovernmentand the private sector partners on:

G. Collaborationwith other Partners (CDF Process)
50. The Government, in cooperation with donors, has carried out substantial work in the
context of the Comprehensive Development Framework. That process already has strengthened
the Government's role in managing donor resources more effectively. This work and local donor
coordination would continue during this CAS period, with a view to promoting more
rationalization of different donor interventions in support of the Government's development
agenda through more sector-wide, coordinated approaches. Under the umbrella of the
"Mini-CG," some 14 partner groups are now functioning, and each has prepared a sector status
and strategy report. These were a key part of the documentation for the November 1999
in-country CG, and have been published on the Government's CDF website
(www.ghanacdf.org.gh/). A feature of the CDF in Ghana is the close collaboration of all resident
UJNagencies. There are explicit linkages between the CDF and the CCA (Common Country
Assessment) and the UNDAF (United Nations Development Assistance Framework) in
particular.
51. In the next stage of the CDF, the priorities will be dissemination to and greater
involvement of civil society, as well as building on the CDF for the next phase of development

planning (Vision 2020, Second Steps, 2001-5). There is also room to improve donor cooperation
in some areas, in particular, cross-cutting themes such as decentralization, governanceand public
sector reform, as well as coordination between the Governmentand civil society groups. A full
update of progress on the CDF is provided in Annex C.
H. Monitoring Outcomes
52. The proposed core indicators that would be used to measure progress are shown in Table 3.
We include the poverty (extreme) headcount and the poverty gap, with the caveat that the next
Ghana Living Standards Survey is not scheduledto be carried out until 2002/2003, with results
available in late 2003. The CAS matrix includes 10 additional indicators that are more sector
specific. Severalwould permit Ghana's progress towards the international development targets to
be monitored. They were chosen in collaboration with Government and are the same as those
Government listed in Part I to monitor its poverty reduction strategy. A subset of these
indicators, relating to areas with significant Bank involvement,would be used to monitor Bank
performance. In the area of portfolio management, our goals are zero problem projects and 100
percent for both the Realism and Proactivity Index. Improvements in the latter, in large part
reflecting the role of the implemenitationteam in the Ghana office, would address the criticism
received in the Client Survey that vverespondedpoorly to problems during project
implementation. We would also aim to maintain our performance on service standards where we
are currently in line with Bank guidelines (elapsed time between Appraisal and Board) and to
improve our record in the area where we lag (elapsed time between Board and effectiveness). We
will use two additional instruments to assess the Bank's performance in carrying out this CAS.
First, we intend to carry out a client survey in order to measure changes with the recent client
survey which has informed this CAS. In addition, a Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) would
be carried out by OED close to the end of the CAS period.

53. This Country Assistance Strategy is consistent with recommendations of the recent OED
Country Assistance Evaluation described earlier (Box 2). First, the triggers for the lending
program focus on progress on macrceconomic stability, redefining the role of the state, and
improving governance. Second, the CAS identifies several opportunities for better integration of
the instruments and relative comparative advantage of the three parts of the World Bank Group
with a view to improvingthe environment for private sector-led growth in Ghana. Third, a
concise set of 16 indicators will be used to measure progress. Fourth, the need to accelerate
agricultural growth is a key theme o:fthe CAS. Improving the access for women farmers to

19
agriculturalservices is an important aspect of the program's strategy. Fifth, the CAE highlighted
the need to reduce the gender gap in basic education. In fact, recent data shows progress in this
area. In addition, IDA's ongoing Literacy and Functional Skills Project is targeted to rural
women who have the highest rates of illiteracy. The Bank is also aiming to improve its advocacy
role in education, as well as donor coordination. Sixth, the CAS recognizes the importance of
containing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Bank, in cooperationwith.other partners, particularly
UNAIDS, is working with the Governmentto step up its efforts. One priority is to provide
financing for non-governmentaland community-basedorganizationsto undertake activities in the
areas of prevention and services for those living with AIDS.
I. Risks
54. The main short-runrisk to this program is the possible inability of the Governmentto
maintain acceptable fiscal performance and macroeconomicstability in the face of both the
severe deterioration in the terms of trade and likely pre-election pressures for spending and for
not taking difficult decisions. In the medium term, the main risk is the continued
"under-performance"of the economy relative to the rates of growth and poverty reduction that
could be achieved with the right enabling environment, stronger fiscal performance,and more
attention by the Governmentto the task of ensuring equitable development.
55. In particular, insufficiently strong fiscal performancewould mean that the enabling
environment for the private sector would remain problematic and the financial system would have
little incentive to increase private lending. Slow progress on incorporatingprivate sector
participation in infrastructureor doing it in a non-transparentmanner would mean that Ghana
would continue to suffer from critical infrastructurebottlenecks,thereby discouragingprivate
investment and limiting the access of Ghanaians to a safe supply of water and electricity.
Together, cocoa and gold exports represent nearly three-quarters of the total value of Ghanaian
exports. The Government's ability to manage unfavorable changes in commodity prices - as is
occurring now - is limited, leaving Ghana vulnerable to periodic external shocks. The Bank has
been a close partner of the Governmentfor nearly two decadesnow. At this juncture, facing an
important political transition and a difficult external environment, it is importantthat the Bank
continue its close involvementwith Ghana and its support in order to encourage the Government
to take the necessary actions to accelerate growth and poverty reduction.

OBJECTIVE 1: INCREASING GROWTH
POVERTY REDUCTION
* About 40% of Ghanaians are poor,
and about 30% are extremnelypoor.
• Between 1991/92 and 1998/99 both
poverty and extreme poverty declined
by about 15%.
* Poverty reductions were concentrated
in Accra and the Rural Forest, (which
produce most of the traditional exports
while poverty stagnated or increased in
the Rural Coast and Savannah.
. Food crop farmers, among whom
poverty is by far the highest, need to
participate more in the economic
expansion.

MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
. The IMF negotiated a new 3-year
ESAF program in 1999. Inflation
declined from 20.8% in 1997 to
13.8% at end-1999. The domestic
primary surplus rose from 3.2% to
3.6% of GDP in 1998 before
dropping to 2.4% in 1999. VAT was
successfully reintroduced in 1999.
. Domestic borrowing requirements
remained high due to insufficiently
strong fiscal performance and high
interest rates. Road sector arrears
continued to accumulate, due to large
interest accruals.

* Promote higher agricultural growth.
* Raise living standards of the poorest

segments of the population.
* Continue to improve capacity to
monitor changes in poverty.
* Implement GLSS (every 4-5 years)
and CWIQ (in between) to assess
progress in poverty reduction.

deteriorated due to sharp
deterioration in terms of trade (cocoa,
gold and oil prices) and shortfalls in
program assistance.
SUSTAINABLE PRIVATE
SECTOR GROWTH (INCLUDING
AGRICULTURE)
. Accelerated growth will come in part
from the expansion of non-traditional
exports, which have quadrupled since
1994.
* If private sector development is to
generate significant growth, the real
interest rate will have to come down
sharply from the present level of over
20 percent.
* For private sector to become engine
of growth, further improvements are
needed in legal and regulatory
framework.
* The private sector has to perceive a
more attractive investment
environment and greater consistency
in the applications of policies.
* Land allocation remains hampered by
inefficient titling and information
systems.
. Sustainable rates of resource
extraction need to be achieved, and
environrental concems addressed.

COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK
Ghana: Second Updating Note

A.

Background

Ghana embarked on a major economic reform effort in the early 1980s and made
1.
measurable progress in the earlier years. The Government hosted "the National Economic
Forum" in 1997, with participation from civil society, the private sector, academics, the political
opposition, etc. The event marked a turning point in accepting the principle of including civil
society and other domestic stakeholders in setting the policy agenda. Furthermore, the increasing
use of sector-wide operations had strengthened Government ownership of the development
process, in addition to helping build partnerships among the country's key external partners. The
relationship between the Bank and the UN system in Ghana is also particularly strong, an
important consideration from the standpoint of forging closer collaboration with the key players.
2.
In short, Ghana had the basic ingredients to try an approach premised on national
consultations, supported by a long-term vision, and founded on country ownership of the
development agenda. The country was thus a suitable candidate to pilot the Comprehensive
Development Framework (CDF) approach and was one of the first to come forward as a pilot. It
helped also that Ghana had already introduced a "Mini-CG" process to facilitate regular
consultations between the Government and its external partners. It was through the Mini-CG
forum that the CDF was launched in February 1999 - barely a month after Mr. Wolfensohn's
discussion draft proposing the new approach. On April 22, 1999, the country's Cabinet
considered a Cabinet Memorandum on the CDF, an important step in building consensus around
the principles embodied in the approach. On May 27, 1999, Executive Directors discussed this
first phase of the Ghana pilot and requested that they be updated on progress at the time of the
CAS.I

B.

Long-Term Vision

3.
There is already in place, a long-term comprehensive vision called "Vision 2020," covering
the period 1995 to 2020 and fully discussed in the country's Parliament. In addition, the country
also has a more detailed medium-term plan for the period 1996-2000 with clearly defined goals
and actions. Only recently, the National Development Planning Commission launched an
ambitious consultation mechanism for involving a wide range of domestic stakeholders in
preparation for the second medium-term plan for 2001-5 -- "Vision 2020: Second Step."
Significantly, poverty reduction is at the core of "Vision 2020" and the Government recently
prepared a Poverty Reduction Paper as part of the background material for the in-country CG
held in Accra, the capital, in November 1999. This also forms the core of Part I of this CAS.
4.
It is worth making the point also that it was "Vision 2020" that formed the basis for
Ghana's last CAS. More recently, sector strategies have been elaborated as the Government
develops its Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The MTEF has emerged as an
important instrument for budgetary management in implementing the country's development
strategy. The Government's commitment at the November 1999 CG to postpone non-essential
capital works and limit new spending to what was already in the MTEF, underscores this point.

Ownership

5.
The CDF approach is premised on country ownership of the policy agenda. Ghana is
increasingly taking the lead in setting the agenda and in coordinating aid activities. Action taken
in April 1999 to fully brief the country's Cabinet was an important step in promoting country
ownership. Also building on the 1997 National Economic Conference, the Government has
increasingly sought to involve other stakeholders in discussing strategies and identifying
priorities. A good example is the consultation process that preceded and followed the in-country
CG last November with extensive CAS/CDF consultations. These consultations were with and
led by civil society in six regions of the country.This effort should have the effect of broadening
the base for the changes being put in place, an important goal that helps sustainability of the
reformnagenda.
6.
It is worth recalling also that the country's long-term vision, "Vision 2020," was actually a
report to Parliament. The involvement of Parliament is important in building ownership for the
vision among the political leadership and in examining the country's long-term options. To
further strengthen ownership, especially among other stakeholders (civil society, the private
sector, etc.), outreach efforts will have to be intensified. Support from Canada and Japan has now
been obtained to finance such an outreach effort, which will be the focus of much activity during
the rest of the CDF pilot phase.
7.
One aspect of ownership which is worth highlightingis the Government's role in preparing
this CAS. The country's development strategy, prepared by the authorities, constitutes the first
section of the CAS, which simultaneously serves as the Government's Interim PRSP. It was also
agreed with Executive Directors in May 1999 that the Government would hold an informal
discussion of the strategy with the Board. Staff would then present Part II of the CAS, the
institution's business plan for defining how it intends to support the priorities and strategies of
Ghana. This is the first time this approach is being tried and it could therefore have implications
for other countries, although it is very much in line with the process envisaged under the PRSP.
This new CAS process is at the core of the CDF for Ghana.
Leadership in aid coordination is an important aspect of country ownership. In Ghana,
8.
there has been measurable progress made with aid coordination, especially through the Mini-CG
mechanism, as indicated above. Mini-CG meetings are held on a quarterly basis while sectoral
meetings are held on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis. As already noted above, an
importantrecent development was the holding of the Tenth CG for Ghana in Accra, the country's
capital. Contrary to concerns about in-country CGs attracting a lower level of representation
from capitals, this was not the case for the Ghana CG. On the contrary, the level of
representation was actually higher than for the preceding CG which was held in Paris. All
partners agreed that all future CG meetings for Ghana should be held in-country. Holding the CG
in Ghana's capital enabled donor representativesto experience first hand the difficulties faced by
the authorities. The CG also focused on the problem of HIV/AIDS, anti-corruption and
decentralization. Ministers who would not have been present in Paris were able to dialogue with
partners on these key issues.
D.

Partnerships

9.
In Ghana, the initial effort in CDF implementation has focused on building stronger
partnerships. To this end, a network of 14 SectoralPartner Groups (SPGs) comprising the sector
ministries, departments and agencies as lead national agencies, with Ghana's development
partners as focal points for support, have been formed. As noted in the earlier "Updating Note," a
key feature of these groups is that different partners (EU, UN agencies, CIDA, DFID etc.)

Annex C
Page 3 of 6

provide "focal support to the Government leaders. The list of these groups is attached again for
ease of reference. SPGs provide a forum for exchanging information, identifying key constraints
and coordinating donor assistance. In preparation for the CG held in Accra in November 1999,
each SPG prepared an Issues Paper setting out the strategy being followed by the Government
and its partners. The Issues Paper also includes a statement/listing of the main programs in place,
as well as identifyingthree to five indicators that should be used to assess performance.
10. Flowing from the Issues Papers, Ghana has now prepared a draft CDF, which was
completed shortly before the CG in November 1999. While the draft is regarded as a "living
document" that will continue to evolve, it was nevertheless an important achievement in the
process of documenting what the CDF approach means for Ghana. The active participation of
domestic stakeholders and Ghana's external partners in the process of reviewing and establishing
sectoral priorities was an important step in forging closer partnerships in the context of the CDF.
The document seeks to provide the context for the CDF (emphasizing the links to the Ghana
Vision 2020), as well as covering developments in individual sectors. The Government's paper,
which forms Part I of this CAS as well as serving as the Interim PRSP, is based heavily on the
CDF document.
11. A recent area of focus for some CDF pilot countries is the development of websites to
disseminate information on CDF developments. The Ghana CDF website became operational in
November 1999, and will continue to be further developed. In the meantime, the site carries some
of the key CDF backgrounddocuments (www.ghanacdforg.gh, and includes all the sector issues
papers.
12. An important offshoot of the Mini-CG process is the emergence of greater selectivity
facilitated by much better coordination of donor activities. This should build on Ghana's
experience with sector-wide operations and avoid undue duplication. A related development is
closer alignment between the national strategy and the business plans of individual donors.
While more work is needed to rationalize the strategy formulation process, the CDF does provide
a framework for this purpose. It can be seen that this process has taken place for the Bank's own
lending program for this CAS period in, for example, education. Partners also intend to examine
such additional scope as may exist to use the Mini-CG process to support inter-sectoral
coordination.
E.

Emerging Challenges

13. Capacity weaknesses constitute a major challenge in Ghana. Ghana's experience with
sector-wide operations has helped, to some extent, both to highlight capacity limitations and to
begin to address them. The Mini-CG process also provides a forum for looking at capacity issues
and how they might be addressed. In the meantime, it is recognized by the authorities that this is
an area that must continue to receive attention. The recent support obtained from Canada and
Japan will be used to support this aspect of the CDF, creating a "CDF Secretariat" in the
Government, and lending technical support to the deepening of the analysis already carried out in
the SPGs. In the meantime, a "CDF for Capacity Building" has been developed and this is
attached.
14. A second major challenge is engaging, more systematically, civil society and the private
sector in the policy debate. Ghana is laying the foundation for this through recent consultations
with civil society. As noted above, these efforts will have to be intensified. Since the country
already has a draft CDF, a third challenge is to ensure an appropriate alignment between the next
phase of the Development Plan for Vision 2020 and the CDF. A strong alignment will suggest
that the CDF process is firmly taking root, with undue duplication in these exercises avoided. In

Annex C
Page 4 of 6

the Budget Statement for the year 2000 (on February 9, 2000), the Minister of Finance proposed
the reconvening of the National Economic Forum this year, to refocus on national economic
priorities in the light of the serious challenges the country is facing this year.
15. A fourth major challenge will be dealing with the issues raised at the in-country CG in
November 1999: in particular, these include HIV/AIDS, anti-corruption and decentralization.
Ghana's development partners used the last CG as a focal point to bring to the Government's
attention the growing problem of AIDS, which in Ghana, as elsewhere in much of Africa, has the
potential to become desperately more serious. While the Government shows signs of accepting
the gravity of the problem, concrete action needs to be taken without delay. Similarly, there is
agreement in principle on the need to intensify anti-corruption work. However, as in the case of
HIV/AIDS, the challenge now is for concrete action. These are harder issues to address, as they
are cross-cutting, and do not fall naturally into the activities of any one ministry, as is the case for
most of the present SPGs. This, however, is where the Mini-CG mechanism can help.
16. Decentralization poses a somewhat different challenge: while the country's partners
express concern about the slow pace, the Government appears to be more satisfied with
achievements to date. This is will be the "theme" for the next CG and preparing the ground for
that discussion poses its own challenges for the authorities in collaboration with their
development partners.
17.
Finally, there are three challenges facing the maintenance of momentum: first, this is an
election year for Ghana, and the first without President Rawlings, so attention will be heavily
focused on that; second, the external shocks affecting Ghana (cocoa, gold and oil prices) are
drawing attention more to short-tern than to medium-term issues; and third, having achieved so
much in time for the in-country CG meeting, there is an inevitable loss of momentum. However,
efforts continue, and, while progress may be slower than in 1999, the creation of the Secretariat
and the incentive of the new CAS process should mitigate these effects. Ghana can be expected
to continue to be one of the more interesting and dynamic CDF pilots.
