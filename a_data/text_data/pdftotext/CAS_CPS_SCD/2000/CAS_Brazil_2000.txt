Executive Summary
A. Over the recent past, Brazil has made impressive advances in its economic and social re-

form program toward a modern economy, driven by the private sector and integrated with international markets. This includes rapid progress of the privatization program, further strengthening
and modernization of the private banking sector, and a major drive to improve education. The
Government has very effectively responded to a series of external shocks over the last two years
through a combination of active interest rate policies and tough fiscal adjustment while protecting
key social expenditures. The transition to a flexible exchange rate regime in early 1999 has
proven smoother than initially expected and has eliminated a major medium-term risk factor for
Brazil's economy. Overall, economic stability has proven robust. The significant advances
achieved in the consolidation of reforms have laid the groundwork for more sustainable growth
and effective poverty reduction in the future, beyond the large one-time poverty gain that came
with stabilization and the introduction of the Real Plan in 1994.
B. This CAS discusses the major strides made in reforming Brazil's economic and social policy
framework and the remaining development challenges. The challenges revolve around five
themes, all of which are related to poverty reduction, which is the first of the themes and the
overarching objective of Bank assistance. The different themes are highly interdependent and are
also united by the common concern to effectively deal with an environment of increased international economic volatility:
(a) Poverty and inequality remain the most important medium to long-term development challenges for Brazil. Especially in the current environment of low growth and fiscal constraints,
there is no single, simple or quick solution to these challenges but a multitude of strategies
that need to work together. Policies to reduce poverty include increased income earning opportunities through stability and renewed growth, targeted policies to enhance the human and
physical capital of the poor (especially through education, health, land reform, and urban and
rural services) to allow them to make use of economic opportunities, and a social safety net to
protect them from shocks in a volatile international economic environment. Importantly, subnational governments carry a significant share of the responsibilities for social policies.
(b) Since the recent crisis period, the Government has made very significant progress on fiscal
adjustment in a short period of time. Fiscal adjustment has been carried out with tremendous
effort and remarkable discipline and has achieved the ambitious targets that were set. Risks to
the sustainability of fiscal adjustment remain a source of vulnerability. The fiscal risks contribute to high real interest rates and slow the resumption of growth and reduction of poverty.
Fiscal constraints also limit the options for counter-cyclical fiscal policies to respond to economic volatility and better protect the poor from income shocks. The remaining reform
agenda includes, most importantly, social security reform at all levels of Government, as well
as tax reform, expenditure reform, as well as fiscal adjustment and administrative reform at
the state level. The Government remains strongly committed to fiscal discipline and its fiscal
targets for 2000 and 2001.
(c) Renewed growth of per-capita incomes is critical for the reduction of poverty. Growth, complemented by continuing progress on environmental management, is also desirable as it raises
the living standards of the population at large and strengthen broad support for the economic
reform agenda. The first priority for growth is continued macroeconomic stability with declining interest rates, which in turn depend on fiscal adjustment and continuing financial
sector reforms. The second priority is a further improved environment for private sector development, including improved access to financing and infrastructure and education investments, development of the appropriate regulatory framework, and further reduction of the
"Custo Brasil". Financial support to private firms which create growth, whether in the form

Page ii

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

of direct financing or credit enhancements and insurance, remains part of the strategy. (The
Private Sector Strategy in Annex 5 presents an expanded discussion of this area.)
(d) The effectiveness of public institutions is important for poverty reduction, growth, and fiscal adjustment. The Federal Government is led by a highly impressive and committed team,
especially in the economic area and in several critical sectoral areas such as education and social security, as evidenced by the effective management of the economic crisis, educational
improvements, and other recent achievements. Many of Brazil's public sector institutions are
considered effective and well-managed, especially at the higher levels. At the same time, important improvements can be made in development effectiveness, which includes issues of
spending efficiency, sub-national institutional capacity, governance and transparency, as well
as continuing reform of the Judiciary.
(e) Environmental management needs to become an integral part of Brazil's overall development strategy, focusing in particular on those environmental policies that help reduce poverty
and contribute to, or are compatible with, renewed economic growth. This includes the effective management of Brazil's natural resources and its pollution problems, which are severe in
many urban areas, and the protection of important ecosystems. Important ecosystems include
Brazil's rainforests, which are the largest repository of biodiversity in the world.
C. Even though the next CAS would be prepared after two years, the present CAS has a threeyear horizon (CY2000-2002),coinciding with the remaining term of the current national and state
administrations, with more detailed discussion of thework program until the end of FY2002.
This CAS is a joint document of the World Bank and IFC and presents an integral World Bank
Group strategy and assistance program. The CAS discusses the activities of all units of IBRD,
IFC, and MIGA.
(a) The tight link of the proposed work program with the development challenges identified in
this CAS would be assured through the following selectivity criteria. The Bank will assist
with activities: (i) that are considered most effective in addressing the identified development
challenges, in particular regarding poverty reduction and fiscal stability; (ii) for which strong
demand and commitment by Government is forthcoming; (iii) that are strategic and catalytic;
(iv) for which the Bank has a clear or emerging comparative advantage; and (v) that represent
the most effective choice from the menu of lending and knowledge-based non-lending services.

(b) In order to ensure a strong focus on top priorities, the Bank would aim to devote about twothirds of its administrative budget to essential activities in the areas of targeted poverty reduction (in particular, education, health, land reform and rural poverty alleviation, urban
services for the poor, and social safety net), or fiscal adjustment (in particular, social security
reform, administrative reform, and state fiscal adjustment). The remainder of the administrative budget would be devoted to activities essential to the other CAS themes of growth, development effectiveness and environmental management, which are also considered important for poverty reduction.
(c) The investment lending program focuses on those projects within the Government's multiyear program that meet the CAS selectivity criteria. While investment lending is constrained
in the current period of fiscal adjustment, the Bank may support the Government's effort to
improve the quality, the sustainability and the social impact of fiscal adjustment, the reforms
of the financial sector and the regulatory environment (including labor regulation) for growth,
trade, and private sector developmentthrough adjustment lending.
(d) Given the importance of sub-national policies for poverty reduction, the work program includes continued direct lending to states within fiscal state eligibility criteria established by
the Federal Government. However, during the current state fiscal adjustment period, direct
State lending is likely to temporarily decline before returning to previous levels. In the mean-

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page iii

time, the Bank intends to step up its non-lending services for a broader group of states.
Lending and non-lending services will focus on, but not be limited to, the States of the Northeast region, which include States with the highest poverty, and a record of deep reforms and
policy innovations.
(e) Specific triggers link the lending volume to fiscal performance, debt sustainability, portfolio
performance, and progress on structural and social reforms. Funds from the special international support package, agreed at a reduced level given Brazil's impressive post-crisis recovery, have been programmed in coordination with the IMF to support administrative and state
fiscal as well as social security reforms.
D. Board members may wish to discuss the following issues/aspects of the Country Assistance
Strategy presented in this document:
(a) The appropriateness of the proposed assistance objectives and priorities given Brazil's economic and political environment.
(b) The poverty-focus of the proposed assistance strategy (paragraph 115).
(c) The temporary change in the composition of Bank lending between investment/adjustment
and federal/state lending (paragraph 115).
(d) The proposed complementarity and collaboration between IBRD, IFC, and MIGA (Box 4,
Annex 5).
(e) The economic downside risks and the strategy's implementation risks (paragraphs 6-7 and
130-131).

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL
FINANCE CORPORATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP
FOR THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL

A. Brazil's Development Agenda
Recent Developments and Risks
1. The three years immediately following stabilization (mid-1994 to mid-1997) were very successful for Brazil in terms of both growth and poverty reduction. This positive outcome was the
result of a well-designed and implemented economic stabilization program together with a favorable international economic environment. By contrast, the last two and a half years (mid- 1997 to
end-1999) have seen a much more volatile international economic environment with a series of
crises in international markets. As early as 1995, the Government attempted to address the structural fiscal deficit unmasked by price stability. However, lack of legislative consensus meant that
fiscal adjustment lagged behind other parts of the economic reformnprogram. As a result, Brazil
has been dependent on large capital inflows. This dependency coupled with the prevailing exchange rate regime implied vulnerability to sentiments in international markets.
2. The Government responded competently and effectively to the loss of market confidence in
late-1998 and early-1999 with a combination of tightened monetary policy and fast-acting fiscal
adjustment measures coupled with a new drive for structural fiscal reforms. Throughout 1999,
fiscal adjustment has been carried out with tremendous effort and remarkable discipline and has
achieved the ambitious targets that were set. These measures, taken together with the liberalization of the exchange rate in January 1999 have been successful in preserving economic stability
and regaining market confidence. In mid-1999, the Government shifted its monetary policy to an
inflation-targeting framework, which is now the basis for interest-rate policies.
3. The immediate impact of the adjustment measures, however, has been a slowdown in economic growth and a temporary reversal of the previously positive trend in poverty reduction.
Following the devaluation in January 1999, a contraction of GDP of as much as 4% in 1999 was
feared. However, primarily owing to the much lower exposure of the banking and corporate sectors in Brazil, the secondary effects of a large nominal devaluation were not as devastating as in
Asia; also agriculture put in a strong performance. Because of subdued demand, there was also
little pressure for a return to wage indexation. As a result, after an initial sharp increase, it became
possible to reduce interest rates without jeopardizing the Government's inflation targets. After
some initial overshooting, the exchange rate had, by early 2000, returned to less than R$1.80,
overnight interest rates had declined to 19% p.a., and current estimates indicate positive growth
of about 0.8% for 1999. Lower interest rates are expected to contribute to a recovery of about 34% in GDP in 2000. The initial effect of the devaluation on price levels has been small, and the
Government has attained its inflation target for 1999 of 8%; however continued vigilance on the
inflation targets is being maintained.
4. In recent years, the dominant share of the current account deficit has been financed by foreign
direct investment (FDI). Brazil has been able to achieve an impressive inflow of FDI in excess of
US$20 billion annually, reaching nearly US$30 billion in 1999.This FDI flow is testimony to the
strong confidence of the international private sector with respect to Brazil's medium-term prospects. Non-privatization FDI has been climbing sharply, and can be expected to remain high, due
to the implementation of post-privatization investment plans, investments associated with the restructuring of Brazil's private sector, attractive asset prices in the post-devaluation environment,
and long-term confidence in the economy. Concurrent with the above, there has also been a rapid
build-up of private external debt. The main external debt indicators are expected to improve after

Page 2

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

1999, reflecting a sizable reduction in amortization in and after the year 2000. Nevertheless, the
external debt service-to-exports ratio is likely to remain very high. In contrast, the debt-to-GDP
ratio remains reasonable.
5. Brazil's remaining economic vulnerability results from its continuing, though declining, fiscal
and current account deficits. As fiscal deficits are closely correlated with current account deficits,
fiscal adjustment is a key instrument for reducing vulnerability. The Government's strategy and
achievements in that area are extensively discussed in paragraphs 32-47 and reflected in the projections in Annex B6. Vulnerability would be further reduced if markets perceived a strong export response, as an indication of improved competitiveness, and, associated with this, a rising
trade surplus making possible a gradual reduction in the current account deficit. While domestic
policy will matter, conditions in the world economy will also be important. The economic recovery in Europe and Asia should assist Brazil, which is a diversified exporter across the major markets. A recovery in Latin America, particularly Argentina would also help. The strengthening
global recovery is already producing some firming in commodity prices which will also benefit
Brazil. As against these benign developments, rising international interest rates will make it
somewhat harder to reduce domestic interest rates, even though the inflation targeting framework
no longer targets the exchange rate explicitly. It is this view of global economic developments
that underpins the base case forecast.
6. Both external shocks (increase in international interest rates or a severe adjustment in the
stock markets of high-income countries) or internal factors (uneven progress on fiscal reforms)
could result in a decrease of confidence and renewed capital outflow. Lack of progress on further
structural and microeconomic reforms-such as deregulation and labor market reforms-or pressure for increased public "developmental" spending would hamper attempts to improve the quality of fiscal adjustment. Further real depreciation under the floating exchange rate regime and/or
further increases in short term interest rates for macroeconomic policy reasons would also affect
fiscal outcomes. Given the increasing resilience of the Brazilian banking system, the risk of destabilization of the financial system as a result of external shocks-with attendant risks of diminished access to foreign financial markets, lower asset quality, and bank failures-is a declining
concern.
7. To reduce external vulnerability and consolidate the macroeconomic basis for growth and
poverty reduction, there is need for further progress on structural fiscal reforms and remaining
microeconomic reforms, for example in the areas of regulation and competition policy as well as
labor market regulation. As these reforms occur, they will make possible some further easing of
monetary policy. Renewed private sector led growth will then lead to reduced fiscal strain, further
reduction of poverty, and continued broad support for the reform program. At the same time, improvements in policies targeted to the poor would further improve the medium-term perspective
for lasting and significant poverty reduction.
8. The Government-in its effort to reconcile continuing fiscal adjustment with poverty reduction and growth-has recently undertaken a concerted effort to prioritize spending and improve
the efficiency of program administration. The resulting development strategy has been articulated
in a four-year program (Plano Plurianual - PPA 2000/3) from which the federal budget proposal
for the year 2000 has been derived (see Box 1). The PPA 2000/3 is used by the Government to
coordinate the support from international agencies within the context of its overall determination
of development priorities. As such, the PPA 2000/3 is a fundamental reference for this CAS. The
PPA 2000/3 represents a Government development strategy that effectively addresses the main
challenges faced by Brazil and is used as the basis for the Bank assistance program.

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 3

Box 1: Brazil's Development Framework:Avan a Brasil - Plano Plurianual 2000/3 (PPA 2000/3)
This CAS is intimately linked to the Government's own comprehensive development strategy. The Federal
Government has recently completed its four-year development plan ("AvanVa Brasil" - Plano PlurianualIPPA 2000/3) on the basis of an earlier study of investment priorities (Estudo dos Eixos Nacionais de
Integraqdo e Desenvolvimento) and the successful experience of the Brasil em Aqdo initiative for setting
priorities within the Government's investment program. The Estudo dos Eixos, based on the geographic and
economic characteristics of each of the regions, identifies priority investments of R$317 billion to be undertaken by the public and private sector over eight years. These investments include infrastructure
(R$186bn), social development (R$113bn), environment (R$16bn) as well as information and knowledge
(R$2bn).
Within the broader eight-year investment program of the Estudo dos Eixos, the PPA determines Federal
Government spending for the next four years. Several states are undertaking a similar prioritization exercise
for their own spending. In the PPA, the strategy of the Federal Government is summarized in six overall
objectives: (i) consolidation of economic stability with sustained growth; (ii) promotion of sustainable development directed at employment generation and creation of income opportunities; (iii) fight against poverty and promotion of citizenship and social inclusion; (iv) the consolidationof democracy and promotion
of human rights; (v) reduction of inter-regional inequalities;and (vi) promotion of the rights of minorities
and victims of discrimination.
More specifically, the PPA 2000/3 encompasses a total of 365 programs supporting 28 specific objectives.
Each program consolidates different Govenumentprojects and initiatives with shared objectives and specifies clear targets, the manager responsible, directions for decentralization and partnership with other actors,
as well as an annual evaluation. The PPA represents a significant shift in the administration of public resources toward more accountability and transparency. The PPA also represents a shift in broader public
sector management approaches toward professionalprogram administration.
The PPA was prepared on the basis of tight budget ceilings, which have forced selectivity and difficult
choices on the part of the Government. The PPA 2000/3 serves as the basis for the elaboration of the annual
budget proposal by the Federal Government, which for the year 2000 proposes discretionary Federal
spending (outras despesas de custeio e capital) of about R$40bn. The Government has submitted the PPA
2000/3 to Congress where the Plan currently awaits final approval.
Poverty Reduction and Social Development
9. Poverty reduction and social mobility are among the main objectives of the Government's
own development strategy. As the overarching objective of Bank assistance to Brazil and the
main driver of the Bank's assistance effort, poverty reduction is the central theme of this CAS.
Each of the five specific themes discussed in this CAS is intimately linked to this overarching
objective. The overall poverty situation and strategy and targeted poverty policies are discussed in
this section.' The other four themes are discussed in subsequent sections but are no less important
for poverty reduction. Fiscal adjustment is a fundamental prerequisite to economic stability and
poverty reduction. Renewed growth through private sector development is equally necessary for
effective poverty reduction. Beyond that, many of the investments that are important for growth
also provide important direct benefits to the poor. Improved development effectiveness of public
institutions will improve the access of the poor to services. Finally, priority environmental issues
are those that generate substantial benefits to the poor (see Box 5).
10. Most of the discussion in this CAS is focused on poverty reduction, as measured by household income and/or consumption. It is important to recognize, however, that the objective of reducing income poverty is embedded in a broader social development agenda. This agenda includes policies to reduce the most severe forms of deprivation and involves issues of inequality of
The CAS draws from a series of recently completed or forthcoming studies that have strengthened the
Bank's understanding of the related issues, among them the Northeast Growth and Poverty Study, the
Urban Poverty Study, the Sub-national Social SpendingStudy, and the Review of Selected Social
Spending Programs.

income, assets, and opportunities, social exclusion, participation, issues related to gender and indigenous people, problems like crime and violence (see also paragraph 72), as well as the provision of services and other non-monetary dimensions of welfare. Many non-monetary aspects of
deprivation are correlated with income poverty, and many of the policies discussed in this CAS
directed at the reduction of income poverty, in particular better educational opportunities and
achievements, will also contribute to broader social development. At the same time, the Government is addressing many of the broader social development issues as well. Many of the issues,
including inequality, are complex and will not be easily resolved in the short term.
11. Many social indicators, including infant mortality, educational attainments, and access to urban services for the poor, have improved steadily over the last decade and have shown a remarkable resilience to the macroeconomic shocks of this period. In contrast, income-poverty has fluctuated widely over the last twenty years roughly in line with the macroeconomic cycles and the
macroeconomic stabilization plans implemented over this period. In addition to fluctuation of the
poverty rate, aggregate numbers mask the large number of vulnerable people who move in and
out of poverty. The Real Plan and its underlying reform program have not only brought about a
positive turn in the periodic poverty cycles but, through economic stability, also created the opportunity for more steady poverty reduction in the future.
12. Poverty Trends. Following a period of increasing poverty from 1987-1994, the Real Plan
significantly reduced poverty and inequality levels during the period 1994-1998. This beneficial
effect was due to: (i) economic growth and rising real wages; (ii) the end of inflation (salary erosion and inflation tax); (iii) a significant appreciation of the local currency shifting prices toward
the service sectors in which most poor work; and (iv) a significant increase in the minimum wage
to which important income sources, such as pensions, are tied. Despite these advances, Brazil
continues to be a country with high income inequality and a high level of poverty for its level of
per-capita income. Using a poverty line of R$65 per capita per month (in 1996 R$), the overall
headcount poverty rate was 22% in 1998.2
13. The succession of economic crises since 1997 has affected the poor mainly through reduced
labor demand and the resulting reduction in employment and/or real wages. The most recent indicative poverty measurements are available from a monthly employment survey, which covers
only six metropolitan areas and captures only labor income3 According to these measurements
(not comparable with the national poverty rate discussed above), the headcount poverty rate in
metropolitan areas dropped from a peak of 35.3% in July 1994 to a low of 24.6% in October
1997. The rate increased continuously from November 1997 until March 1999, when it reached
30.0%. The latest data through September 1999 shows a slight improvement in poverty rates indicating a reversal in the negative crisis impact. Country-wide indicators show a trend of slowly
reducing labor income inequality continue through 1998.The rate of open unemployment reached
a high of 8.2% in March 1999 but since then declined again to 6.3% (December 1999).
14. Poverty Profile. Both intra and inter-regional inequality are very high. Poverty continues to
be highly concentrated in the Northeast (see Table 1): 63% of the country's poor live in the nine
Northeastern states. Poverty rates are much higher in rural areas with the result that the poor are
about equally split between urban and rural areas (see Table 2). Poverty in Brazil is closely associated with low levels of education: 73% of poor households are headed by individuals with four
or less years of schooling. A large share of the poor work in the informal sector (21.8% informal
employees and 42.6% self-employed) or are inactive (8.6%) (see Table 3). There is a significant

15. Poverty Analysis. Brazil has a comprehensive system of household surveys that allows detailed measurement of poverty and poverty trends, albeit with some important limitations and a
strong urban bias, and an active research community that uses this data for high quality poverty
analysis. In its analytical work. the Bank is collaborating closely with many national researchers
and institutions. Dynamic poverty analysis is still incipient but likely a fruitful field of increasing
activity. Inspired-among others-by the Bank-supported LSMS undertaken in 1996/97, discussions are underway on reforms of the household survey system that would allow better use of
household survey data for policy-directed questions about the distributional impact of different
policies and programs. The Government is also putting increasing emphasis on the rigorous
evaluation of social programs in order to inform the discussion about improvements in social
spending.
16. Poverty Policies. The Government has made poverty reduction a priority and has advanced
in modernizing and improving the effectiveness of social policies. Overall, Government policies
to reduce poverty are driven by the desire to increase economic opportunities for disadvantaged
groups and create ladders for a sustainable escape from poverty. At the same time, several obstacles to more rapid and significant reduction of poverty remain. These obstacles and policies to
address them are discussed in tum: (i) limited opportunities as the result of low growth and the

Page 6

relatively small poverty-reducing effect of growth; (ii) low educational attainments; (iii) poor
health; (iv) lack of physical assets and services for the poor; (v) gaps in the social safety net and
resulting insecurity; (vi) issues related to the quality and targeting of social spending; and (vii)
limits to the effective voice of the poor in decision making processes of relevance to them (for a
subjective view of the voices of Brazilian poor see Box 2).
Box 2: Voices of the Brazilian Poor - A View from Ten Favelas
In preparation of the 2000/01 World Development Report, a study team undertook consultations with 632
poor individuals in ten favela neighborhoods in Recife, PE, Itabuna, BA, and Santo Andre, SP. Consultations were undertaken in early 1999 and included structured discussion groups and individual interviews.
The main findings of these consultationswere very similarto the findings of parallel studies in other developing countries in Latin America and elsewhere-a total of 60,000 individuals in 60 countries were consulted:
*

Poor people relate their poverty to powerlessness and vulnerability to unemployment (referring to absence of stable well-paying jobs rather than unemployment in a narrow, technical sense), violence and
a physically harmful environment. They associate well-being with security in terms of steady employment and income as well as public services and housing.

*

Over time, insecurity, in particular with respect to employment and violence has worsened; however,
overall well being was improving in terms of urban and other public services, education, access to consumption goods, and income derived in particular from pensions.

*

Unemployment, followed by lack of schooling and urban services are considered the most important
causes of poverty. Correspondingly, the two key factors associated with an escape from poverty are a
stable job and education, followed by better urban services.

.

The key problems that the poor want to see addressed are (in order of priority): unemployment, security/safety, poor housing and urban services, and health care.

*

The poor consider the Catholic church one of the most important institutions; neighborhood associations are also seen as crucial; NGOs, on the other hand, are often not considered important or particularly helpful; the attitudes toward many governmental institutions and service programs are positive;
however the police is unanimously regarded as the worst institution, in urgent need of improvement.

*

There are important gender differences in the effect and perception of poverty. Women are more involved with their children's education. Women are more affected by violence within the community
and within the household. The domestic division of labor appears to be moving toward less inequality.
Women's participation in the workforce is increasing, on the one hand, offering new opportunities, but
on the other hand, increasing the workload of working women whose domestic responsibilities typically do not decrease.

17. Recent studies (for example, the Bank's Northeast Poverty Report) have reconfirmed that
there is no single or simple solution to poverty in Brazil. Consistent with this view, the different
obstacles to poverty reduction have to be addressed simultaneously, and a strategy for reducing
poverty in Brazil must have several complementary elements. A comprehensive poverty reduction strategy must be based on a good understanding of the different causes and consequences of
poverty for different population groups, including men and women. It is directed at the reduction
of both income poverty and other forms of deprivation.
18. Per-capita GDP growth has been negative for the last two years and was relatively low in the
two preceding years. As a result, there has been little or no increase in labor income which could
lift the poor above the poverty line. Moreover, per capita GDP growth in Brazil has been less effective than in other countries to reduce poverty. One percent of growth of per capita GDP is estimated to reduce the poverty rate in Brazil by only about 0.7% compared to 2% typical for developing countries. The main reason for this low elasticity is high income inequality, which implies that a small share of any incremental income accrues to the poor. In addition, those poor
with very low education levels are often not able to benefit from economic opportunities. In par-

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 7

ticular, the very poorest among the poor-the bottom 10-15% of Brazil's income distributionessentially appear not to have been helped much by economic growth.4 Finally, further empirical
analysis is needed on the particular patterns of growth that Brazil has experienced and their impact on poverty reduction require. There are indications that changes in the patterns of growth
could bring about higher benefits in terms of generating employment and reducing poverty in the
future.
19. Notwithstanding the relatively low growth elasticity of poverty reduction, resumed growth
that generates employment opportunities for the poor will have to be a key contributor to the sustained reduction of poverty in the future. The related policies are discussed in the section on
growth and in Annex 5. To overcome the low effect that growth has had on poverty reduction in
Brazil, additional measures are needed to bring about more broad-based growth and, to the extent
possible, reduce inequality. This includes educational improvements and financial market reforms
(both discussed elsewhere) as well as labor market reforms. Recent Government initiatives to
support and strengthen micro, small and medium-enterprises are also important for supporting
employment-intensive and poverty-reducinggrowth.5
20. The Government is actively pursuing important reforms of labor regulation, whose impor-

tance is highlighted by the recent structural increase in unemployment. Issues under active consideration include regulatory reforms, changes to the labor court system, and other policies to improve the functioning of labor markets. These reforms occur in the context of high costs of employment in Brazil. Also, labor courts, unions, and an uncertain regulatory environment impose
costs on companies that are hard to predict. This causes capital substitution in all firms. In addition, by virtue of their size, larger companies are able to manage and predict these costs more
successfully than more employment-intensive medium size companies (or small firms, to the extent that they are subject to effective regulation).

21. Over the last few years, the Government has given major emphasis to education and impressively implemented major reforms in the sector. As a result, Brazil has achieved impressive im-

provements in public education, including a massive expansion of basic education and a reduction
in the regional differences is education access and quality. Recent advances to improve educational quality through improved equality of spending on education have been significant and are
likely to produce further positive results (see Table 4). Still, low educational outcomes and attainment among the poor remain the single most important obstacle to reducing poverty and inequality in Brazil. Educational inequality, rather than labor market segmentation or discrimination,

explains most labor income inequality in Brazil. The low quality of public schooling in poor areas, related to traditional spending inequalities that are now being addressed by reforms, is the
main obstacle to better educational performnanceof the poor. Low education levels lead to low
income, which in turn, perpetuates poverty. Further improvements in educational outcomes have
to be at the core of any medium to long-term strategy to increase the ability of the poor to take
advantage of economic opportunities and reduce poverty in Brazil.
22. Despite important recent improvementstoward more equal access to health services and toward better funding mechanisms for basic health care, poor health services and poor indicators of
basic health for poorer population groups remain an important problem. Recent initiatives to focus on basic, female, and family health services are of great strategic importance and promise
important results. Further public health care system reform directed at the needs of the poor-toward more efficient and equitable funding mechanisms and incentives for effective service provision at lower government levels-are underway but need to advance further. These reforms will
be important to strengthen the human capital of the poor.
23. Limited access to physical assets by the rural poor is another obstacle for poverty reduction. Historical ownership patterns, which date back to colonial times, and past policies have
brought about a highly unequal distribution of land ownership, which today is a critical constraint
underlying rural poverty. Distorted financial markets do little to redress inequities. The agricultural credit system in Brazil is still characterized by the use of subsidized, directed credit which
represents a fiscal burden and exposure that is likely to be regressive in its incidence. In the interior of the Northeast, periodic droughts pose a serious challenge and often hinder the accumulation of capital by the rural poor. Well-designed policies to enhance the productive assets of the
rural poor, including, but not limited to, land reform pursued through cost-effective mechanisms,
address the principal causes of rural poverty. Micro-credit is another important area for further
development. As access to capital is typically more important for the poor than price, such programs should be designed to be commercially viable and financially sustainable.
24. Lack of affordable housing and gaps in urban services limit the quality of life but also the
economic opportunities of the urban poor. With 80% of the population and almost 50% of the
poor living in urban areas, the fast growth of many urban areas coupled with financially unsustainable subsidy policies for urban services have led to a persistent access gap for urban services
for the poor. Housing, water and sanitation services are typically the highest priorities. Past
housing financing was very regressive with most financial contracts extended to households
above commonly used poverty lines. At the same time, and except for a few states in the South of
the country, there is no formal low-income housing policy backed by financial resources consistent with minimum building and urban planning standards. Improvements in housing and basic
physical services for the poor can significantly improve living conditions and contribute to income earning opportunities through: (i) more time for and better access to paid work and education, (ii) the use of the house and the neighborhood for economic activities, and (iii) better
chances of finding work with residence in a regular neighborhood.
25. At the macro-level, fiscal adjustment and continuing price stability are important to reduce
sources of income risks for the poor; at the micro-level, Brazil's social policies include several
programs that constitute elements of a social safety net. These programs include minimum pension programs, unemployment insurance, a severance payment scheme (FGTS), and programs
directed at specific vulnerable population groups. Govemments at different levels are also experimenting with workfare programs and transfer payments linked to children's school attendance. Transfer programs are of significant scale and scope and include spending of nearly R$20
billion a year according to some estimates. Analysis of the sources of income of low-income
households in Brazil reveals that these transfer program have made a very significant contribution
to poverty reduction over recent years, in particular in rural areas.

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 9

26. The Government wants to focus the social safety net on cases of true emergency (such as the
rural workfare programs in periods of drought in the Northeast) and on programs that link transfers to structural social policies, which address the causes of poverty and create ladders for a sustainable escape from poverty. The latter case includes transfer programs linked to school attendance (Bolsa Escola). Given fiscal constraints and possible adverse incentive effects, the Government is understandably reluctant to create new safety net programs that do not fall into either
category, such as broader workfare programs or generalized minimum income support. Remaining gaps of the safety net, for example for workers outside of the formal sector, would be filled
gradually through refinements and improvements in existing programs. At the sarne time, ongoing experiences would be carefully evaluated to design possible well-targeted and efficiently implemented additional elements of the social safety net that would further increase income security
and reduce the number of poor.
27. Related to the previous items are problems of effectiveness, efficiency and targeting of social spending. Brazil's public sector spends a large share of its budgets in the social areas. International comparison shows that total social spending, including social security, as a share of GDP
(about 20%) high in Brazil, but spending on education and health is on the low side, a problem
that cannot be addressed until social security reform begins to free up resources. Social spending
is often not well targeted and sometimes not efficiently implemented. Federal social spending in
1997, excluding social security, was R$44 billion (or about 6% of GDP). While recognizing the
multiple objectives and multiple target groups of different social programs, it is illustrative that
R$8 billion (18%) of this spending are estimated to have reached the bottom 20% of the population.7 Of federal social security spending of R$67 billion, only 7.4% are estimated to have
reached the bottom 20% of the population in 1996/7. Putting these spending figures into perspective, the aggregate poverty gap of Brazil was about R$12 billion in 1996. This is the amount of
money that theoretically would be needed every year to raise the income of every poor person
from their current income (as measured by the PNAD household survey) up to a poverty line of
R$65 per month. This is a theoretical measure since it would be impossible to perfectly target the
poor, determine their income with precision, avoid adverse incentives on the behavior of targeted
individuals, and transfer income without any costs.
28. Structural reform of social spending needs to continue, aimed at: (i) achieving higher efficiency in the delivery of social services and programs; (ii) improving the targeting of programs
toward the poor; and (iii) reducing rigidity and earmarking in the financing and budgeting of social spending. Social spending reform is complicated by rigidities in the form of Constitutional
and legal entitlements as well as earmarked funding sources. Constituencies are attached to each
spending line item from which funds might be reallocated toward better targeted programs. Progress on social spending reform is therefore a gradual process and should be assessed against realistic benchmarks.
29. Empowerment of the poor and their representation and participation in decision making are
important dimensions of poverty reduction. On the positive side, there is strong participation of
community associations and other civil society organizations in poverty reduction efforts in Brazil (see paragraph 127). Also, the remarkable move of poverty reduction to the top of Brazil's
agenda of public debates, over the last year in particular, is noteworthy and will likely lead to
stronger political support for anti-poverty policies in the future. In this context, Congress has recently formed a joint commission to debate concrete proposals for additional poverty reduction
efforts. Also, a proposal to create a new Poverty Alleviation Fund has the support of the Government and is currently being debated in Congress. Further progress would be important, for example, in the effectiveness and transparency of the public sector in terms of providing services to the
poor and the targeting social spending to the poor (see also paragraph 66).

30. Poverty Reduction Outlook. Taking together the policy reforms undertaken in recent years,
other elements of the poverty reduction strategy discussed above, and the recently increased public and political attention toward poverty problems, the perspective for Brazil's poor is clearly
improving. Structural reforms of the economy have laid the groundwork for economic stability
that would protect the poor from income fluctuations related to past failed stabilization attempts.
The impact of renewed growth on poverty reduction will be gradual but important. The major
drive for improved education is still recent but will yield significant poverty reduction results in
the medium term. The impact of other structural social policies including land reform, urban upgrading, professional training, labor market reforms, and others, is difficult to quantify but qualitatively important and expected to continue. The poverty reducing impact of transfer programs
has been large in recent years and is also expected to continue, especially if measures for better
targeting are successfully implemented.

31. The Govemment has indicated its intention to reduce extreme poverty by 50% by 20158
which provides a useful benchmark for assessing the relative importance of different policies.
Order-of-magnitude simulations show how this objective could be obtained by a combination of
educational improvements, increased growth, and other measures (other structural social policies,
such as land reform, rural and urban services, and transfer programs). Extrapolating improvements in educational achievements and their income effect over the last few years to 2015, poverty rates could drop by the order of 15% by 2015. Real GDP growth of 6% annually would be
required to reduce the poverty rate by 2015 by a further 35%, thus achieving a poverty rate of half
of the 1996 level (see Figure 1, left). With a lower growth rate (for example 3.5% annually), the
shortfall from the 50% poverty reduction target would have to be made up by the joint effect of
other structural social policies and improved social protection (see Figure 1, right).
Fiscal Stability

32. Lagging fiscal adjustment has been the underlying source of Brazil's large extemal financing
requirements and its vulnerability to market sentiments.9 Risks to a sustainable fiscal adjustment
have contributed to high real interest rates and hindered the resumption of growth and the reduction of poverty. Fiscal constraints necessary due to lagging fiscal adjustment have also limited the
options for counter-cyclical fiscal policies to respond to economic volatility and better protect the
poor from income shocks.
33. Facing a crisis of market confidence linked to the fiscal deficit, the Govemment changed the
exchange rate regime and tightened monetary policy, both of which temporarily aggravated the

fiscal situation in 1999.Table 5 shows the deterioration of fiscal performance through 1998. Brazil's public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in 1998, which amounted to 8% of GDP, increased the public debt/GDP ratio from 34.6 to 42.4% of GDP. Declining confidence in the ability to support a crawling exchange rate band led to a decline in liquid international reserves to
US$40.3 billion in November 1998. In turn, reserve losses led to a change in the exchange rate
system in January 1999,from the crawling exchange rate band introduced at the onset of the Real
Plan to a floating rate.10 The resulting 64% devaluation vis-a-vis the US$ (from R$1.21 to
R$1.98) raised the debt/GDP ratio to about 51.2% in January 1999 and increased the PSBR in
1999, reflecting the dollar-denominated and dollar-indexed federal debt (which comprised about
28% of total debt in late 1998). Interest rate increases designed to contain reserve outflows drastically increased the cost of Government borrowing, thus, making fiscal adjustment even more difficult.

34. The Government and its economic team have impressively and effectively managed the economic crisis. Facing multiple constraints, the Government responded through an adjustment program that has received the full support and endorsement of the Bank. Brazil's program to achieve
fiscal sustainability and reduce public sector indebtedness encompasses the continuation of its
privatization program; short-term measures to achieve immediate improvements in fiscal outcomes; and longer term reforms to address the structural sources of inadequate fiscal performance, including social security, administrative reforms, and intergovernmental finance. The Government has also been active in improving the management of its debt stock and its contingent
liabilities, as well as its assets, primarily in the form of debts owed to the Treasury by state governments. Each of these is described below.
35. The Government's objective is to reduce the public sector's net debt/GDP ratio to around
46.5% by the end of the year 2001. If this target materializes, Brazil will be better able to withstand external shocks with less disruption of the domestic economy. Fiscal stability will also allow a reduction of real interest rates helping fiscal sustainability and growth. To achieve its debt
target, the Government aims to generate primary surpluses for the non-financial public sector exceeding 3% of GDP during 1999-2001, with the bulk of the adjustment being at the level of the
Federal Government. The large and notable improvement in the primary balance during the first
ten months of 1999, equaling almost 4% of GDP, stems from a major fiscal effort that the Government has been undertaking after the Russia crisis. The Government sustained this effort with
remarkable persistence and discipline in the presence of major obstacles. The ambitious fiscal
adjustment targets set for 1999 have been achieved, and the net debt/GDP ratio has declined to
47.7% by the end of 1999.

10 Notably, the 1999 devaluation occurred as confidencefaltered in the aftermath of a debt moratorium
declared by one of the major states in Brazil, underscoring the fragile state of sub-national finances.

36. The short-term fiscal measures that are being undertaken comprise actions to both reduce
expenditures and raise revenues during 1999-2001.Measures to reduce expenditures cover lower
wage adjustments (the federal government maintained the policy initiated in 1994 of not granting
linear wage increases to the civil service), suspendedhiring and promotions, and cuts in non-labor
costs and investments. Measures to increase revenues cover increases in the CPMF, COFINS,
social security contributions, and oil product prices. Under the Government's original October
1998 program (Programa de Estabilidade Fiscal), these measures were expected to yield an additional balance of about 2.0-2.4% of GDP per year during 1999-00, although the measures were
subject to risks, particularly those originating in legal challenges to the increases in contributions.
In the event (and as a result of a stronger program designed in March 1999), the Federal Government generated a primary surplus of about 2.3% of GDP in 1999, which indicates a major improvement over the deficit of 1.3% of GDP that had been projected without the measures. Under
the original program, adjustments at the sub-national level were expected to yield a primary surplus of 0.4% of GDP in 1999 and 0.5% of GDP thereafter, triggered by the stronger handle on
the states that the Government now has as a result of the debt-refinancing agreements. In the
event, the 1999 surplus of states and municipalities has been only about 0.2%, albeit an improvement over the 0.2% deficit in 1998.
37. The short-term fiscal measures have been indispensable to achieve fiscal sustainability in the
presence of expenditure rigidities; however, they have a cost in terms of the quality of fiscal adjustment. This cost in quality is represented first by the rise in Brazil's already high tax burden
(about 31% of GDP) and, second, in the need to contain certain expenditures that contribute to
development and poverty reduction." This cost emphasizesthe need to loosen expenditure rigidities through key, longer term structural reforms, in particular social security and public employment reform.
38. Longer term structural reforms comprise administrative reform, social security reform, tax
reform, and reform of the fiscal code (Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal), with fiscal benefits that
would increase over time. Since the interest burden is endogenous and the discretionary budget is
already squeezed, only public employment and social security reforms can achieve a substantial
sustainable reduction in spending. These are difficult reforms since they must address Constitutional and legal rigidities as well as opposition by major interest groups. Delays in approval and
implementation of these reforms will place an additional burden of adjustment on the discretionary budget or on taxation. As a minimum, social security reforms should prevent a rise in the
share of GDP absorbed by retirement benefit expenditures, and administrative reforms should
ensure a continuing decline in the ratio of the public sector wage bill to GDP.
39. Social security reform is the single most important fiscal issue facing the Federal and subnational Governments. The overall pension deficit was about R$40 billion in 1998, or about 5%
of GDP. When interest on public debt accumulated on behalf of public pensions is included, this
ratio may nearly double to 9.5% of GDP.12 Four-fifth of the pension deficit is caused by public
sector pensions (RJU), half of which is at the federal level. The private sector pension (RGPS)
deficit has been rising, but the RGPS deficit per beneficiary remains a small fraction of the RJU
deficit per beneficiary. The main challenges for social security reform are to: (i) reduce the cost
of RJU pensions; (ii) reduce differences between RGPS and RJ1J pensions by cutting RJU benefits more than RGPS benefits while keeping the safety net element of the pension system effective; and (iii) encourage sustainable growth of funded pension plans.

40. Thus far, public sector social security reform (RJU) aimed at strengthening and enforcing of
pension eligibility criteria and attempted to increase civil service contributions (including contributions by inactive personnel). The latter were overturned by the Supreme Court, and the Government has submitted new draft legislation in this regard to Congress. As public sector pension
reforms are ongoing, it is too early to judge their fiscal impact. Assuming that an average contribution rate of 10% on public sector pensions is achieved, the permanent annual fiscal impact
would be of the order of 0.25-0.5% of GDP. Longer-termn effects of the reforms are considerably
more promising: According to new legislation that is in Congress, new civil service hires can belong to the RGPS, which could result in a gradual phasing out of the more generous RJU.
41. Enacted RGPS reforms aim at delaying retirement of workers in the private sector and controlling benefit levels (by relating expected benefits to time of contribution through afator previdencidrio). The effects of RGPS reforms depend on the response of workers to the changes in
retirement rules and are thus difficult to estimate with precision. Clearly, there will be important
fiscal gains in the short, medium, and long term over the base case. Under optimistic assumptions, the reforms to date would return the RGPS to fiscal balance from 2003 onward for the next
twenty years. The Government is not ruling out further reforms (specifically establishing a minimum retirement age and obtaining contributions from the self-employed), but they are contingent
on broad political support.
42. Administrative reform is nearly complete. It will set maximum limits on the ratio of personnel expenditures to revenues, allow governments that exceed those limits to unilaterally dismiss tenured personnel, allow governments to hire under the more flexible private sector labor
regime (which also reduces retirement costs), and permit dismissals based on poor performance.
The last measure is still awaiting final Senate approval. Governments will also have other options
to reduce personnel costs, including reduction of fringe benefits, dismissal of non-tenured staff,
auditing of wages and retirement benefits, and voluntary separation programs. Assuming that
measures are such as to meet the maximum legal limits, the fiscal savings would be of the order
of 5%-10% of the public sector wage bill, or 0.5%-1% of GDP.
43. A tax reform to substitute distortionary indirect taxes and improve intergovernmental tax
relations and incentives is presently being discussed in Congress. The reform aims at replacing
most existing cascading taxes by a single value added tax. This value added tax is expected to be
designed in a way that would avoid predatory tax competition between states. While this reform
is unlikely to increase Brazil's already high tax/GDP ratio (about 30%), it will certainly improve
the efficiency of the system. Nevertheless, short term federal tax measures are expected to increase federal tax collections in 1999 by about 0.5% of GDP (from 20.5% to 21.0%).
44. A Fiscal Responsibility Law has been passed by the House and is awaiting Senate approval.
This law would establish limits on indebtedness and expenditure increases for all levels of governments. It will also require that each individual government set and enforce targets with regard
to revenues, expenditures, fiscal balance, debt, and net worth. Enactment of this reform could
make an important difference as it will strengthen budget constraints and reinforce incentives that
the federal and sub-national governments face to plan and meet fiscal performance targets. In
particular, the periodic release of information on fiscal targets and compliance with them will
create a more effective basis for voters and markets to judge the fiscal performance of governments and thus increase transparency and accountability.
45. The overall fiscal adjustment program requires state fiscal adjustment with significant short
and medium-term improvements in sub-national fiscal results. As at the federal level, reforms at
the sub-national level will need to focus on personnel expenditures, both through administrative
reform and, as federal legislation permits, through addressing the heavy burden of benefits paid to
retired civil servants. The Fiscal Responsibility Law would likely strengthen the incentives for the
implementation of the necessary structural reform at the sub-national level.

Page 14

46. At this time, the main instruments for state fiscal adjustment are the state-debt refinancing
agreements that the Federal Government has recently concluded with almost all states. These
agreements substantially alter the rules of the game for federal-state fiscal relations. The agreements reduce the present value of state debt obligations (through a 30-year refinancing at a 67.5% real rate of interest) in exchange for a collateralization of these obligations (through federal
access to federal-state constitutional transfers and state own tax revenues) and strict limits on new
borrowing. The federal-state debt agreements require a positive primary fiscal balance and determine a declining ratio of debt-to-revenues over time, individually for each state. The agreements
provide some limited incentives for additional adjustment as space within the limits of the debt
ceilings, created by additional adjustment, would permit new borrowing.
47. Inevitably, the current rules of fiscal adjustment are viewed as unfavorable to still uncreditworthy states that have undertaken major fiscal adjustment in the past and whose debt-revenue
ratios are relatively low but still above one. Given the overall fiscal constraints, this effect is unavoidable. In order to avoid perverse incentives against state adjustment, it is critical for the Federal Government to emphasize the one-time nature of the state-debt agreements and their link to
irreversible changes in the regime of federal-state fiscal relations. In this regard, the final passing
of the Fiscal Responsibility Law would further reinforce the positive signal that the Federal Government recently sent by not assuming defaulted state debt and compelling the state in question to
make its own external debt service payments.
48. Observing the need to rapidly obtain fiscal results, state fiscal adjustment should be undertaken in a way consistent with a long-term vision for effective and efficient intergovernmental
fiscal relations. In the short-term and given the problems associated with raising revenues, fiscal
improvements require state expenditure adjustment. This adjustment is currently achieved
through expenditures and borrowing constraints included in the state-debt agreements. As, over
time, all sides strictly adhere to the agreements, and the Federal Government establishes a reputation of not implicitly guaranteeing state debt, the administrative controls could be gradually replaced by increased state discretion and effective and rigorous market discipline expressed, in
particular, in commercial debt ratings. This transition from administrative controls to market discipline would be expected to occur earlier in well-adjusted states.
49. Debt Management. Since the beginning of the Real Plan the authorities have been engaged
in an effort to improve the management of the Federal balance sheet, and have attempted to
lengthen the maturity and duration of Government liabilities. At the same time, the onset of stability resulted in significant increases in Federal debt as the Federal Government recapitalized
both public and private sector banks, and repeatedly assumed the repayment obligations of State
governments. The crisis of 1997-99 partially reversed the progress that had been made to reduce
the interest and refinancing risks of Government debt, but the authorities are making renewed
efforts in this area. The Government is working with securities markets to improve conditions for
investor hedging against interest rate changes (through put options and other derivative techniques), to deepen access to the secondary market for public securities, and to improve information on the market. The Bank has assisted the authorities in thinking more systematically on risk
management of their liabilities, within an asset-liability framework.The Government has been
following a steady policy of recognizing contingent liabilities generated in the past. The process
of such recognition is still underway: there remains a substantial body of unresolved sub-par assets generated by intervened public and private banks, and in the portfolios of operating federal
banks, which will need to be recognized, and will generate their own pressure on the federal debt
stock.
Economic Development and Growth

50. Economic growth is crucial for poverty reduction notwithstanding earlier comments about the
relatively low growth elasticity of poverty rates in Brazil. Past experience (see paragraph 18)

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 15

suggests that annual real GDP growth of about 3% will just be sufficient to hold the total number
of poor constant. Growth of about 6% by itself, on the other hand, would reduce the poverty rate
by perhaps one-third by 2015. The importance of growth for poverty reduction is magnified by its
implications for the sustainability of the reform program and of distributive policies. The 1990s
consensus that Brazil stands to gain from integration with the world economy has motivated stabilization, privatization of infrastructure, and liberalization of foreign trade and investment. This
consensus would be reinforced by the expectation of sustained growth. (See also paragraphs 4853 of the accompanying Private Sector Strategy.) Renewed growth is also desirable for its welfare-increasing effect for the population at large.
51. Reforms over the last decade have improved the competitiveness of a vibrant private sector
and reduced both the cost of capital and the Custo Brasil.13 Supply-side improvements in productivity and profitability, owing to the microeconomic and structural reforms of the past decade,
including deindexation, have been of importance in helping firms cope with the higher input costs
associated with devaluation in 1999. This would augur well for growth prospects in the next few
years. However, although productivity has increased, the output response has been muted by three
principal factors. First, public financing requirements have remained at a level that crowds out
private investment. Second, the Asian and Russian financial crises, large interest-rate hikes, and
the 1999 devaluation have produced an environment in which the private sector has reduced longterm investment outside of safe industries such as telecom and utilities. Third, despite progress,
the private sector still views infrastructure (especially transport) as a production bottleneck.
52. The analytical basis for reliable growth projections for Brazil is relatively weak, and both

the Government and the Bank are trying to improve the understanding of growth processes in the
Brazilian economy. In the meantime, available estimates of potential growth (i.e., from the supply
side) in Brazil appear in two recent World Bank studies. Two years ago, before the most recent
turbulence, the World Bank estimated potential growth as 4.6% (3.3% per capita), higher than the
growth Brazil has experienced on a sustained basis since 1980.14This report identified Brazil's
low savings rate as the main constraint on growth. Another recent World Bank report relatedac5 The estual growth to policies and estimated a 3.7% (2.4% per-capita) growth trend for Brazil."
timate takes into account measures of infrastructure, primary education enrolment, the level of
GDP, the quality of institutions, and Brazil's actual growth from 1990to 1997. On all but the last
of these, Brazil scores above average for Latin America. The reason for the low growth forecast is
therefore Brazil's low growth rate in the recent past. A more bullish assessment of growth potential comes from a study by McKinsey and Company, which indicates that, moving towards international best practices, Brazil could potentially increase its GDP by 8.5% (7.2% per capita) per
year for a ten year period, thereby doubling real per-capita incomes. Based on the considerations
here and in paragraph 5, this CAS uses a projection of 3.7% growth for 2000 and 4.0% in the
following two years (see Annex B6).
53. Patterns of Growth. Private sector consultations reveal a concern that recent growth in Brazil has favored large, international companies at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprise, which are typically more labor-intensive and thus critical for translating growth into em-

governing private enterprise tend to increase industrial concentration and-given that there are
special support programs and some exceptions or evasion from bureaucratic rules for small enterprises (see paragraph 19 and footnote 5)-mitigate particularly against medium-sized companies.
While the problems faced by small and medium-sized companies are well recognized and not
unique to Brazil, rigorous evidence and analytical understanding of the issues remain scant. Especially given the changes in the economic environment introduced by the devaluation, the issues
related to the patterns of growth and poverty reduction require further detailed study, to which the
Bank would contribute.
54. Pro-Poor Growth Policies. Fiscal reforms to reduce interest rates and increase availability of
capital are by far the highest priority for pro-poor economic growth, especially since they would
pave the way for increased capital access for medium-sized companies, which are on average
more labor intensive than blue chip-firms. Most of the growth policies outlined below, can be
broadly fiscally neutral. Given that fiscal imbalances have been identified as the main issue, fiscal
neutrality is an important condition for further policies to have their desired effects. A comprehensive growth agenda, which would favor labor-intensive and pro-poor growth, would include:
(i) improvements in access to capital and further reduction in the cost of capital, which will follow from financial-sector reforms and a reduction in the regulatory wedge between the price and
the cost of credit; (ii) the provision of infrastructure (especially transport) that larger companies
currently to some extent self-provide; (iii) improved labor productivity; (iv) policies to encourage
exports; (v) technology upgrading; and (vi) regional development initiatives. These policies are
discussed below. Other important policies, not discussed further here, include tax reform (see
paragraph 43), the removal of bureaucratic obstacles to the private sector, and appropriate regulation of monopolies. (See the Private Sector Strategy Annex for a more detailed discussion of the
financial constraints facing Brazilian firms, and of the Custo Brasil.)
55. Brazil exhibits both a low level and a high cost of financial intermediation with credit to the
private sector as share of GDP below the average for upper middle income countries. Half of this
credit is provided by state-owned institutions. While Brazil's inflationary history is clearly an
important factor, many other impediments contribute to this low-intermediation "trap", especially
the legal and regulatory environment in which financial institutions operate. Stock market capitalization is about 21% of GDP, relatively low as well 8 and the role of the capital markets in financial intermediation is limited to raising capital for the largest publicly traded firms, with very
limited impact on disciplining corporate governance.Given the scarcity of finance for the private
sector, a high share of lending has been channeled to the lowest-cost, lowest-risk borrowers.
Government policies to strengthen the banking sector (high reserve ratios, for instance)-while
they have served their monetary purpose-have had the side-effect of limiting the availability of
credit to the middle market. FDI and foreign portfolio equity have also been attracted mainly by
large, internationally competitive enterprises such as in telecom and utilities. (See paragraphs 1439 of the Private Sector Strategy for an expanded discussion of the financial sector.)

56. Corporate governance is increasingly entering the public-policy debate in Brazil as an important factor limiting access to finance.'9A central issue relates to voting rights within corporations: the protection of investor interests is an important factor in determining the appraisal of
risk. Minority shareholders often do not have adequate protection and this may diminish flows in
portfolio investment and mitigate against good management. According to one study, 62% of
major listed companies have one shareholder who controls over half of the voting rights and, in
these companies,voting rights do not generally reflect equity at risk.0
57. Infrastructure. Beyond fiscal and financial measures, the priority area for Government action is infrastructure provision. Infrastructure is of particular importance to small and medium
enterprises that do not have the option of providing these services for themselves. Transport costs
are high, and the strategic development of multi-modal transport links requires government coordination. This priority is reflected in the PPA 2000/3. Increasing demand for electricity will also
create the need for investments, and here the priority lies with reaching areas that are currently
not served. Here, the PPA 2000/3 envisages increased use of renewable energy sources. The third
major axis for infrastructure investment is water provision. Investments to provide water infrastructure to the Northeast of the country are of primary importance, and are also envisaged in the
government's strategic plan.
58. Recent productivity gains in Brazil have been achieved partly through the opening of markets
which has allowed cheaper and better foreign inputs to be substituted for local ones. Unlesslabor
productivity can be increased, these gains may remain static, and dynamic gains from endogenous learning and upgrading may remain out of reach. Raising the quality of the labor force involves increasing the quality of educational institutions, access to these for the under-privileged,
and coordination between these institutions and the private sector. Firm-led training of the labor
force has been initiated in several countries on the premise that firns know best what their employees need training in,2 ' and current estimates put the returns to training of labor force in Brazil
2 Vocational training institutes
around 20% (returns to firm-led training are likely higher)?
and
technical training centers are publicly funded in Brazil (as in most countries), yet firms are seldom found to be utilizing their services.
59. Export growth has been sluggish, leading to a persistent current account deficit. Between
1990 and 1996, Brazil's ratio of exports to GDP declined at current prices (though the ratio at
constant prices increased). Brazil's overall share in international trade has been roughly constant,
although some increase in Brazil's exports is expected in 2000. Brazilian participation ingrowing
international markets has increased from 24% of exports to nearly 26% in 1990-1996. The share
of these products for which Brazil's share of world trade is rising has increased from 3.7 to 7.9%
over the same period. Many of these products turn out to be resource- rather than technologybased, which is natural given Brazil's endowment of land and natural resources. However, the
technological content embodied in Brazilian exports to major markets has been stagnant between
1985 and 1996, which may imply that the country is forgoing some positive technological spillovers.

60. The devaluation of the Real in early 1999 has removed a major obstacle to export growth, but
additional policies to support exports could be undertaken. Export volumes have already responded positively to the 1999 devaluation; however export values have suffered from a deterioration in the terms-of-trade. Further trade liberalization, in particular reduction and harmonization
of Mercosul tariffs and possible broader trade integration with other countries or blocks, would
help encourage trade. Improvements of transport infrastructure linked to intemational trade,
chiefly ports and multimodal systems, provide obvious advantages for export growth (see also
paragraph 57).
61. There may also be other services lacking that would promote exports: testing, certification, or
metrology services, for example. If constraints are identified, either collective action on the part
of producers could be facilitated, or the efficiency of public resources increased by directing them
towards alleviating these constraints. Such interventions may be relatively simple, low cost, and
may increase the retums to other, larger investments in infrastructure. A specific example of the
Bank providing catalytic assistance in this area includes efforts to develop agriculture exports
through better protection from plant and livestock diseases. Public-private collaboration promotes
the eradication of diseases, which in turn permits access to export markets that were closed for
sanitary reasons.
62. Technology-based products are taking up an increasing share of world trade, and developing countries are playing an increasing role in this trend. In 1995,high-technology products, such
as electronics, made up about 7% of Brazil's exports, compared with about 13% for Latin America as a whole (the latter figure is strongly influenced by Mexico's maquilladoras). The share of
medium-technology exports, such as automobiles and chemicals, is higher in Brazil than in Latin
America as a whole, but this advantage has been eroding over time (in Brazil 29% in 1985 and
39% compared with 20% in 1985 and 36% in 1995 for Latin America as a whole) 3 Whereas industrial countries devote upwards of 2% of their GDP to research and development (R&D), Brazil devotes roughly 0.8%. Furthermore, industry-financed R&D as a share of GDP is between I
and 2% and growing fast in these countries, but only 0.2% in Brazil.
63. Given the importance of science and technology development for future growth and the relative position of Brazil in this respect, instruments to address technological upgrading without
posing additional burden on the public budget should be explored. The Bank has produced a report on these issues and supports policies in this area through a science and technology loan under
implementation. The Brazilian Government has already embarked on a reform effort to create an
environment conducive to increased and better-focused science and technology expenditures.
Technology transfer controls, including restrictions on the software imports, have been almost
eliminated. Research in the private sector has been encouraged through matching grants. Existing
research institutions and universities are of high quality in Brazil and could help companies to
upgrade. However, these institutions need to be better aligned to the needs of domestic industry
through stronger university-industry cooperation. Additional initiatives should aim at: (i) increasing R&D by the private sector; (ii) increasing the supply of qualified scientists, engineers,
and technicians in line with demands of industry; and (iii) tightening the management and improving monitoring and evaluation of science and technology programs. Finally, necessary
changes in the role of the public sector in the face of the significant changes occurring in the private sector due to the advances of information technology need to be discussed and considered.
64. Inequalities in regional development remain of paramount importance in Brazil. In addition
to the impediments to growth mentioned so far here, informational problems and coordination
failures on the part of producers have on occasion been addressed in the Northeast of Brazil
through a "cluster approach"-identifying a set of related industries in the same region that may
23

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 19

serve as a driver for regional growth. The facilitation of public private partnership can lead to the
identification of critical bottlenecks in public services and align public investment and spending
with the needs of the private sector. Such initiatives base themselves in existing regional strengths
(avoiding "picking winners"), increase the leverage of public resources, and facilitate learning,
technological upgrading, and dynamic productivity gains. Furthermore, the demonstration effect
of such initiatives may be significant. These pilots could be used to demonstrate the potential that
underlies a participatory approach to other states or regions. Encouraging cross-fertilization of
ideas and sharing of tools and lessons across regions could catalyze similar initiatives in other
clusters or regions of Brazil.
Development Effectiveness
65. Development effectiveness and governance encompass a broad range of issues including effective voice of different population groups in public decision making, accountability, political
instability and violence, government effectiveness,regulatory burden, rule of law, and corruption.
Many of these issues are closely related to the other CAS themes. In particular, improvements in
governance are likely to contribute to poverty reduction, growth, fiscal stability, and even environmental management.
66. Available data suggests that Brazil generally is ranked in the top half among the countries of
Latin America and the Caribbean on many key governance indicators. In a recent World Bank
study,2 4 Brazil ranks 11 out of 27 countries in the region on an aggregated measure of voice, accountability, and public participation. On indicators of political instability and violence, Brazil
ranks 15 out of 25 countries surveyed in the region. On indicators of governmental effectiveness,
Brazil ranks 12 out of 25 countries. Brazil's lowest regional ranking comes on indicators of regulatory burden, on which it scores 20 out of 27 countries surveyed. On indicators of the rule of
law, Brazil occupies position 12 out of 27 countries in the region. Finally, on indicators of corruption, Brazil does relatively well, ranking 7 out of 25 countries surveyed. While there is some
variation in the rankings of Brazil depending on the data sources employed, its better than intermediate position is generally confirmed.
67. Overall, governance is not viewed as an overriding obstacle to Brazilian development, at least
when considered in comparative perspective. It is far from the crippling systemic problem that
exists in many developing countries. Moreover, progress is occurring in several areas of governance. For example, issues related to the political system, such as a fragmented political party system, the relative lack of party discipline within the political parties themselves, the complexities
of legislative-executive relations, and possible reforms in this area are actively being discussed
and some progress is likely. Nevertheless, there are no grounds for complacency stemming from
these and related findings, and important improvementscan undoubtedly still be made.
68. Institutional Capacity. As evidenced by the very impressive management of the recent economic crisis, Brazil is endowed with highly qualified and effective policy management teams
who are well represented in high Government positions. Many public sector institutions at the
federal level are well managed and show a high capacity for self-renewal, occasionally requesting
the involvement of the Bank as a window into international best practice. The Central Bank, for
example, was able to act decisively in resolving problems of distressed banks in 1995, but also
chose to participate in a technical assistance loan with the World Bank to support its further modernization, particularly in the area of banking supervision. Its reputation has steadily improved
domestically and globally. It is currently reviewing the legal basis for its own operations to define

better its autonomy and its accountability Similarly the National Treasury has been improving its
infrastructure for professional debt management and has welcomed Bank engagement in this process, which has involved assistance for debt management at the state level, as has the Ministry of
Social Security in seeking to improve its policy analysis and administrative functions
69 At the same time, there remain a range of issues pertaining to the effectiveness of many governmental agencies at the national level that would suggest that a second generation of administrative reforms would bring important benefits Institutional development challenges persist for
the public sector at the level of many states and, in particular, municipalities The upgrading of
the capacity of many municipalities, especially smaller ones, is of critical importance for effectively carrying out their responsibilities for decentralized service provision in areas such as education, health, and others
70 The way in which the decentralization process has taken place in Brazil has contributed to a
lack of fiscal discipline by many sub-national govemments The proposed Fiscal Responsibility
Law would constitute major progress in this respect More generally, reform of intergovernmental
fiscal relations is also important to create clearer responsibilities and thus better incentives for
both efficient service delivery and fiscal discipline
71 Lack of accountability and transparency in the public sector are generally not considered
dominant development obstacles in Brazil Recent data point to a very significant reduction in
corruption over the last years within the overall process of consolidation of democracy These
improvements were likely the result of economic reforms (e g, privatization, trade liberalization)
that have reduced the opportunities for rent-seeking Also, financial management control systems
and public procurement systems have been improved For example, each Federal Ministry has a
Secretariat of Control, which reports directly to the Secretaria Federal de Controle The Government's financial management and control system (SIAFI) under the National Treasury includes computerized monitoring of expenditures and has become a model that is being replicated
by other countries The Federal Govemment has supported sub-national Governments in the implementation of programs to detect distortions in the wage bill, among others In addition to active control by special institutions of the Federal Govemment, a watchful media and Congress are
taking an increasingly active role in issues of government accountability, for example through the
process of parliamentary investigations Further improvements will come along with other public
sector reforms directed at reducing the discretion of public officials, increasing transparency and
establishing accountability

72 Judicial Reform There is an ongoing debate in Brazil on reform of the judicial system The
issues are numerous and include the length of time for disposing of court cases, preparation of
judges, procedural rules, judicial infrastructure, particularly regarding information technology,
and, more delicately, questions of balance of powers between the Judiciary and the Executive
Important improvements have been made, for example, through Brazil's system of small claim
courts, which has served as a model to other countries Improved judicial efficiency is of importance for, among others, development of the financial sector, and reduction of crime and violence
(a) Judicial factors-the weak rights of secured and unsecured creditors and the limited enforcement of contracts-are important determinants of Brazil's low level of financial intermediation (see paragraph 55) On cross-country indicators of contract enforceability, Brazil scores
considerably below countries in the upper middle income group and OECD countries Simple
regression analysis on these indicators suggests that private credit as share of GDP would
have been predicted as twice as high-55% instead of 25%-over the period 1980-95 if Bra-

zil had achieved the average rank in contract enforceability for OECD countries. The impli25
cations for growth over this period would have been substantial.
(b) Crime and violence are complex phenomena with multiple causes and consequences. They
are perceived as increasing problems, especially in urban areas and especially for the poor.
Reforms of the Judicial systems are important for dealing more effectively with these problems. The perceptions of uneven punishment of criminals and of unequal access to justice by
the poor also need to be addressed.
Environment and Natural Resource Management
73. Environment and natural resource management is closely linked with the other four themes of
this CAS, in particular growth and poverty reduction. The Government is steadily advancing in
the management of environmental issues and natural resources, in particular with respect to those
environmental policies that also serve growth and poverty reduction objectives. The Government
has, with World Bank support, introduced a new model of multi-sectoral water resource management at the river basin level based on economic principles. The passing of a federal framework law for water resource management constitutes an important step toward more efficient
water resource management and needs to be followed by effective implementation. Improved approaches to land and soil management have been successfully promoted through Bank financed
projects. At the same time, land and soil protection remain an important priority in different regions of the country, including the semi-arid Northeast where unsustainable farming techniques
can lead to desertification.
74. Urban pollution issues are severe in many areas and include lack of sewage collection, air
pollution in the biggest metropolitan areas, and water pollution in rivers, lakes and ocean beaches
in and around major cities. Progress continues in terms of ongoing decentralization of environmental management responsibilities as well as larger participation of the private sector and civil
society in environmental management. The difficult ongoing modernization and, in some cases,
privatization of several state water and sewage companies is likely to improve the conditions for
better water quality management. Overall progress is hindered, however, by weak integration of
environmental aspects and environmental institutions with other sectors.
75. Brazil houses several important ecosystems, including the Amazon, the Mata Atldntica and
the Pantanal, and is one of the countries with the richest biodiversity in the world, a potentially
economically valuable resource. Deforestationdata for the Brazilian Amazon are available for the
period 1977-88 (average) and the years 1989-1997.26 An estimate is also available for 1998. The
data show falling deforestation rates for the beginning of the 90s (from 0.53% to 0.28%), a large
increase in 1995 (to 0.72%), again a continued fall over 1996 and 1997 (to 0.33%), and then
again an increase in 1998 (to 0.42%). The average annual deforestation for 1989-1998 was
16,358 km2 per year, which is 23% below the average for 1978-1988. The cumulative deforested
area until 1998 amounted to about 547,000 kM2 , almost 14% of the Amazon's original forest
cover and three times as much as in 1978. The largest deforestation occurs in the states of Mato
Grosso, Para and Rond6nia (86% of the total in 1997), which together withAcre State form the
"deforestation belt" of the Amazon.
76. Deforestation is the result of a complex interplay of forces involving farming, ranching, logging, mining, and others, and is closely related to economic factors, including inflation, capital
availability and land prices. Solutions are equally complex and require a combination of protec-

tion of priority ecosystems with balanced measures to reduce poverty and develop sustainable
alternatives for increasing the income of the local population The Government is experimenting
with such alternatives through its Rainforest Pilot Program, in which the Bank plays a key coordination and secretariat role Interest in the conservation of some of the country's environmental
assets reaches beyond Brazil as these provide positive international externalities (e g, blodiversity, carbon sequestration)
77 The Government strategy for improved environmental management includes four elements
First, the modernization of still mostly command-and-controlinstruments of environmental management would promote the use of economic instruments based on the polluter-pays principle
This also includes instruments for prioritizing environmental problems based on economic principles Second, effective decentralization of environmental management and improved accountability of environmental institutions require a clear division of responsibilities between environmental and sector agencies and between the different levels of Government Third, dialogue with
and closer particlpation of the private sector in environmental management is critical, especially
during the current period of fiscal restraint The final element is the mamstreaming of environmental management, which implies the integration of environmental concerns in institutions and
decisions taken by other sectors
78 Brazil is the world's third largest consumer country of ozone depleting substance (ODS)after China and Russia, and just ahead of Korea Consumption growth has offset reductions from
investments made in technological conversion Brazil still consumed approximately 10,000 tons
of CFCs in 1997 out of a world consumption of about 165,000tons The Montreal Protocol calls
for a 50% cut by 2005 The policies in place rely exclusively on equipment bans, and their effectiveness will depend on strong enforcement by IBAMA A complementary set of instruments may
be needed to ensure reductions towards the 2005 target

B. The Brazil - Bank Group Partnership
Progress Since The Last CAS
79 Highlights The 1997 CAS focused on structural reforms, fiscal adjustment, poverty reduction-with a particular emphasis on long term education improvements-and portfolio management Within the framework of the previous CAS, and aided by the CMU's location in the field,
the partnership with Brazil has been strengthened and deepened Highlights of this two and a half
year period include among others (i) the focus of the 1997 CAS on education, (ii) the intensification of state assistance programs, and (In) participation in the Special SECAL Package to support the Government in the 1998/9 economic crisis (discussed in the following paragraphs) Other
areas of emphasis during this period include (iv) support for a successful market-assisted land
reforn pilot program, and (v) support for critical reforms of the social security system (discussed
in the respective work program sections)
80 The assistance program in the education area has grown significantly within the long-term
thrust expressed in the 1997 CAS Sector work on secondary education, higher education, and
early childhood development has been undertaken with broad participation of stakeholders and in
close collaboration with Government and development partners This sector work has created a
sound foundation for well-grounded expansion of Bank assistance in this sector A strong dialogue with the Government and a renewed focus of the Government on this area underpin the
work program The FUNDESCOLA 1 and 2 projects (see Box 3) support improvements in school
quality and in the management of state and municipal education systems Over the recent years
the Bank has focused increasingly on supporting state-level education interventions and reforms
While the drive to support states directly, in particular in the Northeast, through education projects has been slowed down by fiscal and creditworthiness constraints, several future state education projects are now under review by the Federal Government and the Bank

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 23

81. The experience with direct state relations has been positive in terms of policy impact and
project implementation. Increased relation with states have included lending for investment and
state reform projects, as well as non-lending services, in particular through State Economic
Memoranda. The State Economic Memoranda have allowed a deepening of the policy dialogue
with selected states and, given the importance of state policies for poverty reduction, strengthened
the policy environment for state lending. The experience of state level adjustment loans (State
Reform Loans) has been positive in terms of the privatization programs supported by these loans
(except water and sanitation). However, it was not possible to incorporate fiscal adjustment targets in these loans as federal-state debt agreements and important administrative reform measures
had not yet been completed at that time. The experience shows that the design of state adjustment
loans should include a detailed state expenditure review, and that the structural preconditions for
expenditure adjustments need to be already in place to ensure the sustainability of adjustment.
Box 3: FUNDESCOLA- An Example of the Bank-Brazil Partnership for Education
The World Bank is supporting the Government's US$1.3 billion FUNDESCOLA Program, whose mission
is to improve the performance of public education systems in the poorest regions of Brazil by strengthening
primary schools and the institutions responsible for them. FUNDESCOLA is based on the premise that
children's learning outcomes are determined by the quality of the schooling they receive. School quality in
turn is a function of teaching and learning conditions; the knowledge, skills and practices of the school's
principal and teachers; the technical support received from local education authorities as well as the social
support from the community itself; and on the availability and use of reliable information on student learning achievement.
The program introduces a five point school-based development strategy to raise school quality by targeting
these determinants in an integrated and concentrated way. First, the program provides schools and their
parent associations with more autonomy over financial resources. The second element in the
FUNDESCOLA strategy is to make sure that these schools meet minimum operational standards, including
qualified teaching staff, a basic package of pedagogical inputs and equipment, and the physical conditions
necessary to assure that schools can function adequately. Third, FUTNDESCOLA
helps education authorities work with schools to design and implementschool development plans. This is an intensive, institutional
development process led by the school principal and involving the entire school community including
teachers, parents, and students. Each plan includes one or more annual school improvement projects, which
include actions and measurable learning improvement targets. These school improvement projects, the
fourth element of the strategy, are also financed by FUNDESCOLA. In the final step of the strategy,
FUNDESCOLA is developing, testing, and disseminating a variety of pedagogical and organizational
frameworks for schools to choose from in order to help assure high levels of learning for all children enrolled.
This school-based development strategy is supported by social mobilization activities to encourage and
engage communities to take a more active role in this process. Moreover, FUNDESCOLA expands a program of institutional development for state and municipal local education authorities to help them support
the school-based development strategy in their jurisdictions. If successful, FUNDESCOLA will help transform thousands of poorly performing schools into effective, high-quality, results-oriented organizations.
Present and future generations of children will benefit from an education system that makes student
achievement its top priority by helping schools participate effectively in a school-based development process, by conferring greater autonomy on the schools, by transferring financial resources directly to schools,
and by routinely providing schoolsand communities with reliable information on student outcomes.
82. Special Adjustment Package. As presented to the Board in a special framework paper in
November 1998, the Bank has responded to the economic crisis in 1998 through its participation
in the special international support package for Brazil. As a first contribution to this package, the
Bank has committed and disbursed US$1 billion in FY99 in special adjustment loans for social
security reform and improved social protection. Two Administrative and Fiscal Reform Loans for
US$500 million each and a Second Social Security Reform Loan for US$500 million are expected to be presented in CY2000. It has been agreed with the Government that after these

Page 24

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

loans-given Brazil's impressive post-crisis recovery-the Bank would make no further Special
SECAL commitments as part of the 1998 international support package (see also paragraph 131).
83. Through its participation in the international support package, the Bank provided support to
structural reforms with strong Government ownership while conveying credible signals to international markets. The structure of a series of single tranche adjustment loans has proven to be an
effective instrument that allows easy reprogramming of the special assistance linked to the reform
efforts. The Government has appreciated the quick initial response of the Bank, which is now
being reshaped in order to give effective support in an evolving situation. In the specific case of
social protection, the special sector adjustment loan has achieved its objective of supporting the
maintenance of critical social programs in the adjustment phase. However, it has been difficult to
communicate to the broader public that this operation was not meant to result in increased
spending on social programs.
84. Recognizing the modest but strategic role appropriate for the Bank in a country of Brazil's
dimensions and complexities, the overall Bank assistance program, including non-lending and
lending services, has increasingly reflected and contributed to the overarching poverty reduction objective. A few examples, among many others, are mentioned here. Starting with the Poverty Assessment, analytical work by the Bank, especially on the incidence of social spending, has
served as an important reference for national debate. In critical areas, such as improvements in
the quality of basic education in the Northeast, the Bank has been a reliable partner to a reformminded Government. In other areas, such as land reform, the Bank has supported important policy innovations. Finally, the Bank's support for the Government's stabilization and fiscal adjustment policies have helped create the preconditions for sustainable poverty reduction.
85. Areas of Bank assistance where progress has been less than expected since the last CAS
include: (i) the slow pace of privatization in the water and sanitation sector, due to the complex
legal issues surrounding this issue; (ii) reforms to environmental management where institutional
weaknesses and difficulties in integrating environmental concerns in other sectors pose continuing challenges; (iii) broader fiscal reforms aimed at increasing the quality of public spending, in
particular in the social areas, where many rigidities in funding and spending arrangements imply
that improvements will only be obtained over time; and (iv) remaining gaps of the social safety
net, an issue difficult to resolve during the current fiscal crisis.
86. Total lending in FY97-99 reached US$4.3 billion, near the lower end of the base case of the
1997 CAS (US$4-6 billion). The volume of new investment loan commitments has fallen from
US$1.6bn in FY98 to US$0.7bn in FY99 in response to the fiscal crisis. About half of all loans
(45% of the value of commitments) have been made directly to states. As a result of the large
share of state loans, the average loan size of the Brazil portfolio is small compared to the Bank's
other major borrowers.
87. Portfolio Management. The quality of the Brazil portfolio continues to be high with only 6
out of 54 loans rated unsatisfactory. This reflects the continuing impact of the 1995/6joint BrazilBank initiative to improve the portfolio and the good alignment of Bank lending with Government priorities. The Bank has created an Implementation Team in the Brasilia Office to improve
procurement, disbursement and financial management performance of projects in the portfolio
and to increase support to the clients.
88. The Government increasingly and correctly treats expenditures financed from World Bank
loans as part of its regular budget, subject to the same fiscal constraints as expenditures financed
from other sources. As a result of, partly, fiscal constraints applied to Bank funding and counterpart funds and, partly, the increased domestic currency value of foreign currency denominated
loans, disbursements from investment loans have fallen from US$1.3bn in FY98 to US$0.9bn in
FY99. A further drastic decline in disbursements has occurred since the beginning of FY00. The
Bank has agreed with Government to aggressively deal with these circumstances through a se-

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 25

quence of loan restructurings and partial cancellations. In any event, fiscal constraints imply a
significantly increased risk to disbursement performance despite active portfolio management.
89. Non-lending services have increased in scale and scope over the last two years and have become an integral part of overall Bank assistance. Non-lending services have made an important
contribution and positioned the Bank in a supportive role on strategic topics such as public sector
employment, social security reform, and poverty reduction policies, which have emerged as critical areas during the economic crisis. There has been increasing demand for non-lending services
in the form of faster and shorter policy notes on specific issues. At the same time, the Bank has
pioneered comprehensive sub-national economic studies (Rio de Janeiro Municipality and Ceara
State).
90. Intensified outreach of the Bank in Brazil has included: (i) targeted dissemination and discussion of major Bank publications with relevant messages for Brazil (World Development Report, Global Economic Prospects, Global Development Finance), and Brazil-specific studies such
as the Country Economic Memorandum; (ii) increased dialogue with various audiences such as
sector specialists, state officials, and academia through the discussion of sector studies and consultation workshops such as those for the Northeast Poverty report, the Ceara State Economic
Memorandum, the Gender Study, and Secondary Education report; (iii) increased dialogue with
NGOs through meetings and workshops; and (iv) increased contact with the media, and better
targeting of relevant joumalists and media outlets to disseminate important messages, project
successes, and others.
91. The decentralization of the CMU to Brasilia in September 1997 has greatly increased the
depth and quality of Brazil-specific knowledge in the Bank and the policy dialogue with the Brazilian Government, reflected only in part in the increasing non-lending services provided by the
Bank. Clearly, the Bank is in a better position today than before decentralization to maintain a
continuous dialogue with the main actors in the main policy areas and effectively offer the services of the Knowledge Bank to the Federal and State Governments. The decentralization of procurement and other services related to project implementation as well as an increasing number of
negotiations conducted in the field have also increased the timeliness and responsiveness of the
Bank's operations in Brazil. Decentralization and intensified outreach has increased the visible
presence of the Bank in Brazil.
92. IFC Activities. As of June 30, 1999, IFC had outstanding committed investments in 69 companies in Brazil with a total exposure amount of US$2.37 billion including US$1.28 billion for its
own account (net exposure). IFC's investment in Brazil covers a broad range of sectors. On a
volume basis, food and agribusiness, chemicals and petrochemicals, infrastructure and general
manufacturing are the sectors with the highest level of IFC's investment. IFC's portfolio is of
high quality and has managed to withstand the economic difficulties experienced by Brazil over
the last 18 months.
93. IFC's activity in Brazil over 1997-1999 has been consistent with the country strategy articulated in the previous CAS with actual approvals of US$2.7 billion within the range indicated in
the CAS for FY97-99 (US$2.5-3.0 billion). Following the priorities set out in the CAS and the
subsequent CAS update, strategic priorities for these investments included: private infrastructure;
capital market development; middle market financing; investments in the northeast states; and
private investment in the social sectors. The opening of a new IFC office in Fortaleza and the relocation of the Director for Latin America to Brazil have further strengthened IFC's field presence.
94. MIGA Activities. As of December 31, 1999 Brazil is the largest host country for MIGA insured investments accounting for 13% of MIGA's total gross exposure. MIGA's outstanding portfolio in Brazil consists of 24 contracts of guarantee for a total gross exposure of US$585 million
(US$18 million in the financial sector, US$175 million in infrastructure, US$57 million in manu-

Page 26

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

facturing, US$15 million in oil and gas, and US$150 million in services), of which MIGA's net
exposure arnounts to US$270 million. To date, the total amount of foreign direct investment facilitated by MIGA is above US$3 billion. FY99 was a record year for MIGA in Brazil. MIGA
issued 7 contracts of guarantee for a total gross exposure of US$177 million, and a cumulative
project cost of US$1.8 billion. In FY2000, confronted with capacity constraints, MIGA has coinsured a power project with the IDB for US$200 million, and insured a medical equipment leasing
operation for US$150 million, of which US$15 million was reinsured to FMO, the Dutch bilateral
agency. An additional guarantee of US$65 million was issued in the power sector.
Comparative Advantages of the Bank

95. Brazil is a large, democratic country with a broad economic base, highly qualified decision
makers, and sophisticated institutions. The Bank is a player along with many others in the context
of the overall development of Brazil. Nevertheless, the Bank has been able to build and maintain
rich relationships with a large range of actors in Brazil and is an important partner for Brazil in
several sectors and for several States. In specific strategic areas, the Bank has been able to contribute its knowledge and international experience to help shape national debates.
96. The Bank is most helpful when it strategically focuses its support through a strategically selected combination of financial and non-financial services in areas where Government has strong
commitment to important reforms but can benefit from complementary technical advice as well
as a structured framework for the implementation of reforms over an extended period of time.
Such areas include, among others, social security, administrative and fiscal reforms, education,
improvements in poverty reduction policies, water resource management, and energy. In other
areas (including policies toward social and distributional changes and environmental improvements), where the Government is struggling with complex issues and attempting to advance with
reforms while balancing diverging interests within the country, the Bank offers its technical and
analytical support, following through with lending or broader assistance if and when requested by
Government.
97. The Bank's multiple knowledge-basednon-financial services are an integral and increasing
part of the menu of assistance products offered by the Bank. The Bank is valued for its nonlending services in Brazil including: (i) advice, technical assistance, and international comparative experience on important development issues; (ii) provision of a structured design and implementation framework for priority projects; and (iii) provision of credible signals to external constituencies, for example regarding progress on important structural reforms at times of economic
uncertainty. Depending on the most effective form of assistance, non-lending services precede
lending (to help prepare reforms underlying new lending), complement ongoing lending (often
permitting rapid implementation of proposals emerging from analytical work), or support reforms
in areas without lending. In the current environment of fiscal constraints that limit lending, increased non-lending services can be of particular importance to support important reforms.
98. The Bank's financial role in Brazil is small but not insignificant2' The financing role of
multilateral institutions, including the Bank, has been to help meet both public sector and balance
of payments financing needs with long term instruments. Brazil's total debt to multilateral institutions (US$16.3 billion) accounted for 6.9% of total external debt in 1998. In 1999,Brazil's capital
account balance of US$11.3 billion was financed partly by multilateral agencies (US$3.4 billion
net disbursements). Capital account balances are projected to be around US$33.5 billion in 2000
(partly to rebuild reserves). Multilateral agencies would be providing about US$3.5 billion to help
meet these financing needs.

Page 27

99. Similarly, a part of the public sector net borrowing of US$45 billion in 1998 was extended by
multilateral agencies. Net public sector borrowing will continue to be positive over the next several years, as the burden of interest payments on the public debt will not be offset by primary surpluses. Borrowing from the Bank will remain important, as these operations are linked to the
public sector's reform efforts. Furthermore,the Government's interest in extending the maturity of
its overall liability portfolio and reduce the average expected cost of gross financing will remain
prime considerations in continuing to borrow from the Bank.
100. Since the Government now appropriately treats expenditures financed from World Bank
loans as part of its regular budget, the Bank will concentrate its funding on selected priority programs from the Government's own investment program (Plano Plurianual 2000/3). In this context, the Bank can play a helpful role in: (i) ensuring that well-conceived investment programs
receive priority; (ii) ensuring that the effect of a reduction of public investment is moderated by
increased quality at the individual project level; and (iii) reducing the cost of government financing within the expenditure targets underlying Government budget plans.
101. Given the positive experience with development impact and implementation of support
directly to the states (see paragraph 81), and given the important Constitutional responsibilities
of the states in particular in the social area, the Bank has a comparative advantage in providing
lending and non-lending services for poverty reduction and fiscal reform directly to states, within
the overall framework set by the Federal Government.Notwithstanding the expectation of a temporary dip in direct state lending (see paragraph 115) for fiscal reasons, the strategic thrust on
direct State support continues. In fact, non-lending support to states is expected to increase in
importance. Fully consistent with recent findings on the effectiveness of external assistance, the
Bank would continue to focus its support on state governmentswith a record of effective reforms,
many of which are located in the poor Northeast, a region in which the Bank has historically had
a strong and effective role that will continue and expand.
102. Bank lending to states has to strengthen incentives for sound state fiscal management and
contribute to addressing the state debt problem. The easiest access to Bank lending would be for
states that are creditworthy (defined as primary surplus in the previous year and a debt-revenue
ratio of one or less) and for loans that have been included in, or for which fiscal space has been
created within the parameters of, the state-debt agreements. In the latter cases, the respective
state's debt-revenue ratio is typically above one but in line with the agreed time path for debt reduction toward a debt-revenue ratio of one. In these cases, states needs to show a record of reforms and fiscal adjustment and continuing efforts toward attaining creditworthiness. All state
lending would be subject to the CAS selectivity criteria and the Federal Government's willingness to guarantee the proposed loan.
103. As state fiscal adjustment occurs, the Bank could later offer a broader array of instruments
for state lending that would both reinforce the necessary discipline in federal-state fiscal relations
and create incentives for fiscal adjustment even for states with a significant debt overhang. Options that could be offered by the Bank include adjustment or adjustment-typJ8 lending to a few
smaller states that have established a record of significant reforms. Lending would be based on a
detailed state expenditure review and would support policies, for example in the area of social
security reform, that would lead to rapid compliance with the agreed debt revenue targets. Given

the importance of state social policies for poverty reduction, the Bank would also offer to give
special treatment to direct state lending for strictly poverty targeted projects 9
104. Given the importance of municipalities for providing certain services, including education, health and urban services, on the one hand, and the institutional weaknesses of many municipalities, on the other hand, there is an important role for the Bank in supporting municipalities
through non-lending services. Given the number of municipalities, such support has to be highly
selective and would be focused on but not limited to the developmental and public sector challenges of the largest municipalities. As an example, the Bank has recently prepared an economic
report for one of the largest municipalities, covering the areas of growth, poverty reduction and
fiscal stability. WBI is expected to play an active role in the area of institutional strengthening of
municipalities.
Box 4: IBRD-IFC-MIGACollaboration
IBRD and IFC are increasingly collaborating in their operations in Brazil to maximize synergies and development impact that can be achieved by pursuing policy reforms (with IBRD support) and private sector
investment (with IFC support) in strategically important areas in a coordinated fashion. Some examples of
this collaboration are discussed here. More detail is provided in Annex 5.
In some areas, collaboration between IBRD and IFC has taken the form of sequential involvement, with
IBRD providing support for reforms that set an appropriate regulatory and policy framework for private
participation, and IFC following with pioneer investmentswhich demonstrate the viability of such participation. This is the case in a number of infrastructure sub-sectors where IFC invested after and/or along
IBRD-supported sector reforms, notably railroads, ports, and roads. These IFC investments required close
coordination with IBRD specialists as to the timing and nature of reforms, and the treatment of a number of
key issues in concessions, including termination compensation provisions, and treatment of excess labor
prior to privatization.
In the case of water and sanitation, the Bank Group will seek to replicate the model of IBRD-supported
policy reforms followed by IFC pioneering investments, providing a demonstration effect that the newly
opened sub-sectors are viable for private investors. IBRD and IFC will also work together on advising the
government (at Federal and state levels) on moving forward on concession designs. IFC and IBRD have
jointly discussed with Government recent reports on regulation and private sector participation in water and
sanitation. IBRD and IFC will prepare a joint sector assistance strategy for water and sanitation to maximize synergies (related to the restructuring of public companies and creation of the regulatory framework,
on the one side, and private sector participation,on the other side).
In the financial sector, IFC and IBRD cooperated in a recent corporate governance assessment that focused
on issues critical to the functioning of financial markets and related to minority shareholder rights and
transparency of information. Collaboration continues in the context of a planned conference to discuss the
assessment and related international experience. Further joint work will focus on securities markets, particularly searching for ways to improve corporate governance. IFC will collaborate here with IBRD sector
work.
On private sector development and growth policies, and small and medium enterprises in particular, IFC
and IBRD expect to collaborate on sector work, with some focused specifically in the Northeast. Other areas where joint activities are ongoing or planned include housing finance, and microfinance. Collaboration
will be enhanced by the planned co-location of IFC and IBRD staff in the Fortaleza office.
During the past two years, cooperation among the IBRD, IFC, and MIGA also increased. One of MIGA
latest guarantee for a medical equipment leasing operation, was in support of IFC's initial investment in the
venture. During its conduct of due diligence prior to issuing guarantees, MIGA benefits from IBRD's and
IFC's country expertise. MIGA directly complements IFC and IBRD's assistance in privatizations, notably
by helping secure additional financing. Following the recent establishment of a Country Development Unit
in MIGA, interactions and coordination between MIGA and both IFC and IBRD, have intensified.
29

Many of the poorest states are also among the better managed and less indebted ones, and creditworthiness criteria would not necessarily mitigate against the poverty focus of the lending program.

ComparativeAdvantages of IFC and MIGA
105. IFC is the largest source of external official finance for the private sector in Brazil. This
enables IFC's financing of the private sector, in aggregate value, to have more of an impact than
that from other agencies. In addition, IFC's financing is highly diversified-as distinct from say
the IDB which is limited to infrastructure-enabling it to support important investments across
sectors. IFC is able to put together financing packages sufficient to fund the capital needs of a
number of middle-market companies, which smaller agencies active in Brazil (for example, the
IIC) are not able to do. IFC also has growing experience in particularly difficult sectors, where
fewer agencies have developed experience. Notable examples would include water treatment and
sanitation, housing finance and capital market development, and private health care and education.
106. The comparison between IFC and the largest domestic source of official finance, BNDES,
yields a different picture. BNDES is several times larger than IFC, is more diversified, and is
more accessible to the Brazilian private sector. Nevertheless, BNDES' current policy in support
of industrial consolidation and privatization has begun to limit the financing of middle market,
industrial or service firms, which has been increasingthe demand for IFC from this segment.
107. Relative to private sources of capital, IFC has a number of advantages and disadvantages.
Among IFC's principal advantages are: (i) its willingness to continue investing notwithstanding
broad swings in international capital markets sentiments; (ii) its long-term experience in Brazil,
combined with its local presence; (iii) growing expertise in a number of difficult sectors, as noted
above; and (iv) a willingness to finance middle-market firms and put together financial packages
in the US$10-50 million range. Among its disadvantages are on the one hand a small financial
capacity (relative to international banks or capital markets), making it irrelevant for larger infrastructure transactions, and on the other hand a cost structure which makes it difficult to support
smaller firms, with financing needs below, say, US$5 million.
108. MIGA's comparative advantage is its ability to catalyze private sector capacity with its own
capacity so as to better facilitate additional private investment into Brazil. Lately, the main private insurers have only been active in Brazil because of MIGA's participation. MIGA's has been a
leader in the field by assisting the IDB and FMO issue their first political risk insurance contract.
Development Partnerships
109. The Bank is collaborating with a large range of actors in support of the reform agenda outlined in this CAS. Assisted by the location of the CMU in Brazil, the Bank has significantly expanded its collaboration with development partners, including a larger number of institutions of
the federal and state governments, but also a variety of civil society organizations, Brazilian research institutions, and the private sector, as well as bilateral and multilateral development agencies (such as GTZ, IDB, UNDP, JBIC, and IICA). At the operational level, the Bank collaborates
closely, for example, with Japanese JBIC with several ongoing and future projects subject to cofinancing or parallel financing (Water Sector Modernization, PROAGUA, Fortaleza Urban
Transport). The closer relationship with development partners permits more strategic selectivity
in some areas (see paragraph 115).
110. The relationship with IDB is characterized by a large degree of consistency and complementarity. The IDB supports four major themes with the main emphasis given to growth and the
reduction of the Custo Brasil (infrastructure, export development, and support of small and medium enterprises) The other three themes are state modernization (including institutional support
to the Executive, the Judiciary, and the Legislature at all three levels of Government, fiscal administration, information and accounting systems), social development (secondary education,
sanitation, urban services, rural settlements), and environmental management (eco-tourism development, Pantanal protection, and National Environment Fund). The size of IDB's lending program is approximately equal to the Bank's.

Page 30

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Il1. The Bank complements the IDB through the strategy proposed in this CAS with a greater
thematic emphasis on poverty reduction and a greater regional emphasis on the Northeast region
as well as a program that is intensive in knowledge-based analytic and advisory activities and
lending that is strongly linked to the Bank's global development knowledge. The complementary
approach has effectively supported strategic collaboration between the two banks. Recent positive
examples of collaboration include the preparation of the Social Protection Special SECAL, with
parallel financing from IDB, the joint preparation of a Secondary Education Report, and complementary assistance in water and sanitation through the Bank's PROSANEAR 2 Technical Assistance Project and the IDB's PASS Investment Project.
112. Cooperation with the IMF has intensified since November 1998, when the Bank agreed
to participate through special adjustment lending in the international support package for Brazil.
Bank staff rely on the Fund for basic macroeconomic data and assessments and have participated
in many joint working sessions with the Government. Fund staff have utilized Bank analysis of
social security and labor markets as well as work on social protection. Cooperation in financial
sector work predates the IMF program with Brazil and continues, as indicated by a joint assessment of implementation of the Basle Core Principles. In addition, the Bank's Central Bank Modernization Technical Assistance Loan was used to fund some of the Central Bank's analytical
work in the move toward an inflation targeting framework.
113. The Bank recognizes the importance of ongoing dialogue and consultation withcivil society organizations (CSOs) in Brazil. Relations with CSOs have been improving steadily and are
now evolving to include regular information exchange, strategic dialogue, and operational collaboration.
(a) Dialogue and consultation with leading Brazilian CSOs (NGOs, community groups, national
social movements, trade unions, churches, and corporate foundations) at all levels range from
sector issues (sanitation, education) to specific projects. The most recent effort was the consultation process with a wide array of civil society organizations for the present CAS (see
Annex 6).
(b) The Bank's efforts for providing greater access to information were enhanced by the relocation and revitalization of the Public Information Center at the Brasilia office in 1999, and the
systematic dissemination of Bank reports and project documents to CSOs and the general
public.
(c) Operational collaboration with CSOs in Bank-financed Government projects is increasing
steadily. This collaboration takes on a variety of forms depending on the thematic area and
project type. It includes: (i) hiring CSO experts to design, monitor, and evaluate projects; (ii)
funding of CSOs through over 20 small-grants funds; (iii) soliciting CSO representation on
project decision-making councils; and (iv) inviting CSOs to co-manage the implementation of
project components.
(d) There are still areas of disagreement with CSOs, one of them land reform where several
CSOs have launched two inspection panel requests relating to the Bank-supported land reform pilot project, which is implemented by community associations0 In this as in other areas the Bank is committed to an open and intensified dialogue with CSOs.
Selectivity and Focus of Bank Assistance
114. Careful and strategic selection of all lending and non-lending activities supported by the
Bank, within the Government policy agenda, is fundamental for development results, as is the
determination of the most effective instruments from the full menu of non-lending and lending
30

In both cases,the InspectionPanelhas reviewedthe requestsand recommendednot to undertakean
Inspection.

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 31

instruments offered by the Bank Group. This CAS suggests selectivity not at the level of entire
sectors but at the level of the role and function of a specific activity, in particular with respect to
poverty reduction and fiscal adjustment. The selection of activities for Bank support is driven by
selectivity criteria, which should be satisfied by each individual activity. It is not sufficient that
individual operations be consistent or compatible with the CAS objectives and selectivity criteria;
they have to be key to achieving the objectives of the CAS themes. The selectivity criteria are:
(a) Critical importance and cost-effectiveness for promoting the reform agenda for poverty reduction, fiscal stability, growth, development effectiveness, or environmental management.
(b) Full consistency with Government objectives, as expressed in particular in the PPA 2000/3,
and strong commitment of the Governmentto the reforms in the supported area.31
(c) Catalytic and strategic role of the activity in advancing priority policy reforms and mobilizing
or redirecting resources beyond the Bank's own lending toward the reform agenda.
(d) Clear or emerging comparative advantage for the Bank Group based on its strengths including advice and international experience, as well as flexible financing instruments.
(e) Choice of the most appropriate instrument for support among lending and knowledge-based
non-lending services or a combination thereof.
115. In terms of the sectoral and thematic objectives, the current CAS proposes continuity and
gradual evolution from the 1997 CAS (poverty reduction and fiscal adjustment as principal objectives, complemented by assistance programs for growth, development effectiveness and environmental management, with a focus on the Northeast region). In terms of lending instruments,
however, the current fiscal adjustment process and the Government's willingness to pursue critical reforms, discussed in the policy discussion in this CAS, present a situation in which the Government's reform efforts can be more effectively supported through some shift in favor of adjustment lending. The new rules of fiscal adjustment appropriately subject spending from Bank
loans to the same fiscal constraints applied to public spending financed from other sources and
are likely to imply a more pro-cyclical pattern of investment lending. In addition to increased
non-lending services, the Bank may attenuate this pattern through a shift to regular or programmatic sector adjustment lending.
116. Programmatic or regular sector adjustment lending would support areas where the

Government has a strategy for a sequence of critical reforms consistent with this CAS and a track
record of policy improvements. Specifically, one or two adjustment loans could support the Government's efforts in each of four areas, three of which directed at better quality, sustainability and
social impact of fiscal adjustment, and one directed at growth: (i) structural fiscal reforms, in particular social security reforms; (ii) improvements in the quality of public spending in selected priority sectors; (iii) improvements in fiscal institutions and public sector management for better
fiscal performance and incentives for fiscal discipline; and (iv) improvements in the policy
framework for renewed growth through financial sector reform and a better regulatory environment (including labor regulation) for growth, trade, and private sector development. A Government program to improve the impact of Government policies on individual citizens could provide
the framework for some of the possible adjustment assistance.
117. The current fiscal adjustment process also involves some fine-tuning of lending in favor
of the Federal Government and away from the states. Despite the positive experience with the

development impact and the implementation of direct state lending, and while the thrust of the
previous CAS on direct support to states is continuing,the strategic objectives of the Government
of selectivity and fiscal adjustment and the current fiscal situation will likely lead to a short-term
31

In priorityareaswhere.Governmentis still tryingto forgesupportiveconsensus,the Bankmayundertake supportiveexploratoryactivities.

Page 32

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

rebalancing of new lending toward (possibly larger) federal loans. As fiscal adjustment is worked
through, a return to the earlier balance between state and federal lending is expected. In the
meantime, the Bank intends to intensify its implementation assistance for state loans and step up
its non-lending services for a broader group of states. This work would be supported by-among
others-the placement of Bank staff in the Northeast (co-located with the IFC).
Box 5: Poverty Reduction as the Overarching Objective of Bank Assistance
In order to give more concrete meaning to poverty reduction as the overarching objective of Bank assistance, this table divides interventions into six categories according to the nature of their contribution to
poverty reduction.

6. Distributionally-neutralinterventions with major Higher education, skills and technology
indirect benefits for the poor (interventions promot- Energy
ing overall growth and effective institutions)
Public sector and economic management
Individual operations within a given sector may fall into a different category than the overall sectoral programs. For example, while broader water resource management assistance falls into category 4 (major
benefits for the poor but directed at multiple objectives), a specific water resource project maybe essential
for poverty alleviation (category 3) if it is focused on the cost-effective provision of safe drinking water to
the poor. Similarly, some health projects serve a much broader objective than just poverty reduction and
would fall into category 4.
118. Poverty reduction as the overarching objective of Bank support is reflected in the sectoral
and regional balance of Bank activities and the design of projects supported by the Bank. First,
activities and sectors that have a direct impact on poverty reduction have priority for Bank support over those activities that have a more indirect impact (see Box 5). Targeted poverty reduction
and fiscal stability (as a basic precondition for sustainable poverty reduction since fiscal imbalance is the main threat to economic stability) are the two principal areas for Bank support among
the five CAS themes, and the Bank will invest about two-thirds of the IBRD administrative
budget in these areas (lending and non-lending services). The remainder of the administrative
budget would be devoted to activities essential to the other CAS themes of growth, development
effectiveness and environmental management, which are also considered important for poverty
reduction. Second, the focus of Bank support on the poorest Northeast region implies a strong

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 33

element of geographic targeting. Third, within projects, measures are taken to increase the poverty targeting and poverty reduction impact.
119. Annex B9 contains the CAS Matrix with objectives and major strategies linked to progress indicators at the country level (including indications of the relative quantitative contribution
that important reforms are expected to make toward the objectives of poverty reduction and fiscal
stability). Following the selectivity criteria defined above, the matrix shows some important policy areas where the Bank itself does not intend to be active with new operations at present due to
either strong presence of other development partners, or lack of current or emerging comparative
advantages of the Bank at this time. These areas include, among others: (i) population and nutrition-UNICEF and UNFPA are playing an active role in this area, (ii) broader agricultural and
rural development (outside of the focus on rural poverty reduction and natural resource/environmental management)-FAO and IICA are active here; and (iii) infrastructure in
areas where the private sector has successfullytaken over the lead role (for example, telecommunications and power generationi).
120. The CAS matrix contains an assessment of the role of the Bank with respect to each strategy and specific benchmarks for assessing Bank performance. Recognizing the challenges associated with determining performance of a bank CAS, an assessment could be based on the following criteria:
(a) Has the Bank been able to focus its assistance on the overarching poverty reductive objective
as outlined in this CAS, considering all lending and non-lending services provided?
(b) Has the Bank been able to assist Government with the creation of effective, replicable models
of policy successes in areas of CAS emphasis, such as targeting of poverty reduction policies,
state level fiscal adjustment, private sector infrastructure provision, or municipal capacity
building?
(c) Has the Bank been able to assist the Governmentwith policy and performance improvements
in a few areas where it concentrates its efforts, for example basic education quality in the
Northeast, or specific aspects of social security reforms?
(d) Has the Bank been able to offer, effectively and satisfactorily to the Government, the knowledge of international development experience in areas such as poverty reduction policies and
quality of fiscal adjustment?
(e) Have the knowledge based non-lending services of the Bank been capable of effectively contributing to the national discussion on policy themes emphasized in the CAS?
The Proposed World Bank Group Work Program

121. The proposed work program in the areas of the five CAS themes attempts to make effective use of the full range of instruments available to the Bank to support key reforms. This includes lending and analytical and advisory services of the Bank, support through the capacity
building instruments of WBI, and/or the financial instruments of IFC and MIGA. During program
implementation, the Bank Group maintains the flexibility to switch between some of these instruments in particular cases as to maintain the most effective mix of assistance instruments for a
given situation.
122. Work to support targeted poverty reduction is the largest share of the Bank's work program. While most other areas of Bank assistance also generate benefits for the poor, this specific
part of the work program is reserved for those interventions essential for poverty reduction and
activities that would be selected, among all feasible interventions, as priorities for poverty reduction.
(a) Basic education (Ensino Fundamental, Ensino Medio, and adult literacy) remains the

principal area of Government-Bank collaboration with medium-term benchmarks for im-

Page 34

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

proved educational outcomes established by Government (see also paragraphs 0 and 80). Improved education outcomes are the single most important element of the poverty reduction
strategy but are also important for stronger growth. State-level basic education loans are under preparation and a further expansion of Fundescola is planned. Early childhood programs,
teacher development interventions, and the provision of basic literacy skills to educationally
disadvantaged adults are new areas of emphasis to improve the educational attainment of the
Brazilian population. Several Bank-commissioned studies provide a strengthened analytical
underpinning for the Bank's education work program. The Bank is also collaborating with the
Government in the scaling up of two pilot projects with important educational links: the Program to Eradicate Child Labor (PETI) and Bolsa Escola.
(b) The Bank is increasing its support for important reforms in the public health care system toward improved basic health care and more equal access to health services. Within this emphasis, a possible project to support primary care interventions, including reproductive health
and nutrition, for women and children as well as early childhood development has strategic
importance. In addition, the Bank would support primary health programs geared toward reducing the risk factors (smoking, alcoholism, blood hypertension, obesity, etc.) associated
with cardiovascular disease, cancer and injuries, through prevention and health promotion.
Finally, the Bank supports health system improvements in the areas of health financing,
regulation of the pharmaceutical sector, decentralization, access to health care, health surveillance, and management of public facilities. The Bank would lend to individual states and
to the Federal Government for the selected priority issues and would pursue collaboration
with other development partners to promote deeper health systems reform. Stronger links
with related social policies, especially in education, are being explored. IFC investments in
the provision of private health care delivery complement the Bank's strategy directed at improved poverty focusing of public health care.
(c) Rural Poverty. The rural poverty program is driven by the central role of community associations as the main actors who directly receive the project funds and implement project activities. This approach has led to cost effective projects that strengthen the social capital of
the rural poor. Follow-up for the ongoing rural poverty projects, which provide matching
grant funds for small social, productive and infrastructure investments, would build on an ongoing evaluation and include a more explicit graduation strategy that underpins the strategic
role of the interventions. A pilot micro-finance project (which is not limited to rural areas)
would explore financially sound approaches in this area. Possible new assistance would focus
on the provision of poverty-focused rural infrastructure: roads, water, and energy, as well as
the institutional capacity to manage these in a more integrated approach. An ongoing rural
poverty study will provide a clearer prioritization of interventions directed at rural poverty
reduction.
(d) The pilot project for market-based land reform is also based on community associations as
the main actors. The pilot has proven successful in terms of low costs, rapid implementation,
and the expected positive impact for rural poverty reduction. The pilot project has demonstrated how the Bank can facilitate social policy innovations and has served as the model for
a new complementary land reform program of the Government (Banco da Terra). The Bank
intends to support, through a large APL, a follow-up land-reform project directed at the poorest segment of landless farmers. In this context, the Bank is seeking collaboration with civil
society organizations at all levels.
(e) Increased support for the provision of urban services to the poor (building on a comprehensive Urban Poverty Report currently being completed) is an important part of the poverty reduction program. The Bank would support the upgrading of low-income neighborhoods, social and physical infrastructure and support for small businesses, with a strong emphasis on
sustainable financing mechanisms and improved incentives for service provision to the poor.

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 35

Support for urban upgrading and improved water and sanitation services (discussed in the
following sub-paragraph) will be increasingly integrated. Lending possibilities include APLs
for urban services for the poor in Recife and small and medium sized cities, respectively.
Analytical work on land and housing markets will initiate possible future operations in this
important area. (The related support for improved local capacity is discussed in paragraph
125. The urban transport program is discussed in paragraph 124.)
(f) The water and sanitation sector has long been a focal area of Bank support due to the importance of these services to the unserved, mostly poor, population, and the potential fiscal
implications. Continuing support focuses on projects that have a clear demonstration effect or
leverage other funds in the areas of: (i) service provision to the poor; (ii) environmental improvement in the context of river basin level management (a LIL for water quality management is under preparation); and (iii) efficiency gains through modernization of the sector, including privatization with special attention paid to mechanisms that ensure service provision
to the poor. Water and sanitation is also a focal area for the IFC. This allows the Bank and
IFC to jointly pursue a strategy of increased private sector participation in the sector. Recently completed studies on regulation of privatized services and private sector participation
in water and sanitation provide a firm basis for the joint sector assistance program.
(g) The Bank is increasingly working with Government in the areas of social protection, and
social spending reform. Ongoing sector work on social protection spending will further
deepen understanding of the issues involved. The Bank is preparing lending in the area of
child labor prevention and could, if requested, lend for improvements to the social safety net,
in particular in the form of compensatory payments linked to school attendance (Bolsa
Escola).
(h) A comprehensive report on labor market policy and regulation is under preparation jointly
with IPEA. This report could lead to follow-up support, for example linked to improvements
of labor programs and special funding mechanisms linked to earmarked payroll taxes.
(i) Many of the specific initiatives discussed above will also promote broader social development in Brazil. In particular, the strong operational role of community associations in Bank
projects is expected to support the formation of social capital among the poorest (see paragraph 127). Also, the Bank has recently undertaken an assessment of gender related issues
and launched a review of the functioning of Bank supported small-grant funds. The Bank will
undertake a study into the sources and consequences of Brazil's high income inequality. Issues of crime and violence in Brazil are studied by the Bank in the context of region-wide
tasks. Additional non-lending services in this area may follow, focusing on international experiences with policies to reduce crime and violence. The Bank is considering a possible LIL
to support the Council of Comunidade Solidaria, which is working with Brazilian NGOs on
the delivery of social programs.
123. The Bank would support fiscal adjustment mostly through non-lending services and adjustment loans if Government actions provide the basis for the latter. A major fiscal study is
nearing completion and serves as the analytical basis for the assistance program. Following analytical work on debt management, a Debt Management LIL could support the Federal Government in this area.
(a) The Bank has supported social security reforms through timely advisory services as well as
one LIL to assist in the reform of state pension systems, which constitute a major fiscal risk,
and another LIL to support reforms of the social security system for private sector workers.
The Bank has completed a major sector report on social security reform. Further reforms at
the federal level and at the state level-once the federal framework allows progress in this
area-could be supported through adjustment lending.

Page 36

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

(b) State fiscal adjustment is being supported primarily through non-lending services, including
the preparation of state economic memoranda. State adjustment and rationalization of the
state payrolls would be supported through the Administrative and Fiscal Reform SECALs.
Further adjustment lending could be linked to structural changes in state fiscal management
and federal-state fiscal relations. Any state lending would only be offered within the framework discussed in paragraphs 102 and 103. Incentives for state fiscal adjustment would also
be enhanced through the eligibility criteria for investment lending to states discussed in the
same paragraphs.
(c) Fiscal adjustment has brought the issue of the quality of public spending to the forefront.
Possible support for improving the quality, sustainability, and social impact of the ongoing
fiscal adjustment program through sector adjustment lending would need to be based on a
strategic review of selected public expenditures in supported sectors (for example, infrastructure and social sectors).
(d) Regular or programmatic sector adjustment lending could support a program of fiscal institutional reform directed at public sector management reforms including improvements in the
budgeting system, issues of accountability and performance control as well as incentives toward maintaining fiscal discipline. Such support would be based on an ongoing Bank study of
fiscal institutions and would take into account significant improvements ongoing in this area,
including the draft Fiscal Responsibility Law and its future implementation.
124. Most important for renewed growth are sound macroeconomic policies and fiscal stability
that will bring down the cost of capital and lead to renewed investment. These issues are discussed separately. To prioritize direct policies to support growth, the Bank would undertake a
comprehensive report on growth policies, with IFC involvement and possibly in collaboration
with BNDES. This work would include analysis of the relationship between the structure of
growth in Brazil, employment generation and poverty reduction, bottlenecks for higher growth
and policy options.
(a) Infrastructure. Reliable energy supply, improvements in regional transport systems (railways, ports, highways) and reductions of transport costs are critical to increase growth and
reduce the Custo Brasil. (See also paragraphs 40-44 of the Private Sector Strategy.) Efficient
urban transport contributes to the growth of cities and improve the quality of life, in many
cases in particular of poorer residents. Given the large financing needs in infrastructure, support from Bank and IFC has to be highly selective and strategic. Bank support focuses on
lending for reforms aimed at: (i) increasing private sector participation; (ii) providing services
to the poor; or (iii) reducing the fiscal burden of infrastructure services. Overall IFC involvement in infrastructure has been mostly in an advisory role. IFC will focus on smaller-scale infrastructure investments with a focus on water, urban transport, and inter-modal transport. Infrastructure also constitutes a large share of MIGA guarantees. Regulation of private provision of infrastructure services is a core area for WBI support in Brazil. The Bank may also finance a TA project (LIL) for regulation.
(b) In regional transport, railways are being restructured and privatized, major port terminals
have been privatized, and federal highways have been decentralized, delegated or privatized.
The Bank will now support: (i) further fiscal efficiency improvements in the highway sector
at federal and state levels; (ii) road investments critical for rural poverty reduction; and (iii)
facilitation of multimodal transport systems. IFC will apply its financial engineering skills in
the latter area. Bank loans for federal and state highway projects would support road system
management at lower cost and concessioning.
(e) Urban transport is part of a broader agenda of efficient city development, which includes
city development strategies, efficient municipal management and finance (see 125). The Bank
has assisted and will continue to assist with the decentralization and subsequent concession-

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 37

ing, including with IFC involvement, of the previously federal urban rail systems in the large
Metropolitan areas. In the medium sized cities (0.5-1.5 million), the Bank would support the
development of integrated urban transport strategies. The regulation of privatized and concessioned transport services will remain a core focus of WBI assistance.
(d) The Bank continues support for the very significant and successful restructuring and privatization process of the energy sector. The private sector now controls 60% of electricity distribution compared to 31% in 1997. Future activities are concentrated in areas where the private sector alone is not addressing important problems: (i) rural energy supply where a study
is proposed to analyze policy options with possible GEF support; (ii) energy efficiency improvements and use of renewable energy, which would be supported together with GEF; and
(iii) issues related to the functioning and regulation of energy markets. Through a guarantee
operation and lending, the Bank supports the development of a regional natural gas market.
(e) In the financial sector, the Bank is stepping up non-lending services to allow for a more frequent and intensified dialogue on issues of common interest and conducive to maintain financial stability, and to resolve low financial intermediation in Brazil. Selected short policy notes
are under development in areas such as bank safety net, impediments to financial intermediation, consolidated supervisory structures, agricultural and housing finance, capital markets
and public debt management. Banking regulation and supervision are being addressed via the
on-going Central Bank TAL and the January 2000 compliance-review with Basle Standards,
jointly undertaken by the Bank and the IMF. The need for new financial sector lending may
emerge subject to the quality of the sector dialogue and priorities in the reform agenda. Activities related to the financial sector also include microfinance and housing finance (see
paragraph 121).In addition, the Government has requested that IFC remain open to providing
wvholesalecredit enhancement support for the private sector, should market conditions make
it necessary. MIGA is expected to continue providing enhancement in the form of insurance
to both banks and private firms.
(f) Private sector development. IFC is focussing on investments that modernize and capitalize
mid-sized Brazilian firms with good growth prospects. (See also paragraphs 69-73 of the Private Sector Strategy.) Growth in this segment of the market is most likely to contribute to the
generation of employment and reduction of poverty. The Bank supports the emerging structure for regulation and competition policy mostly through non-lending services but also plans
LILs for regulation and competition policies, respectively. IFC and Bank are jointly providing technical assistance for strengthened corporate governance, in particular minority shareholder rights, disclosure of information,transparency and independent oversight. The Bank is
also supporting an initiative in the Northeast to develop business clusters developed in publicprivate sector partnership. The first phase of this work has been concluded and follow up is
being contemplated by the participating States. IFC and Bank intend to jointly undertake
sector work on obstacles and policy options for private sector development. Sector work is
also planned on international economic integration and MERCOSUL, including private sector
development and trade issues.
(g) In the areas of higher education, skill and technology development, the Bank is already
active through an ongoing science and technology project. Future Bank assistance could include non-lending services regarding international experience with the implications of information and other new technologies on public sector management and policies in Brazil. Another area of assistance is the reform of higher education, possibly through an APL in support
of a student loan system that would allow existing public resources to be focused on the expansion of higher education and their accessibility for a broader segment of the Brazilian
population. The IFC is undertaking complementary investments in higher and/or technical
education.

Page 38

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

(h) The Bank may, through regular or programmatic sector adjustment lending, support the
Government's program to reform the financial sector and the policy and regulatory environment (including labor regulation) for growth, trade and private sector development.
125. In the area of development effectiveness and governance, there are several emerging areas
of support:
(a) Non lending-services on overall economic management (other than those already mentioned) would include additional State Economic Memoranda, in particular for states or
groups of states in the Northeast. These reports cover poverty, growth, and fiscal issues in
addition to any concerns of the specific state. Additional state-level non-lending services are
planned for specific areas of concern of, mostly Northeastern, States. A possible LIL for
Rond6nia State would focus on state reform and fiscal adjustment.
(b) The Bank is already supporting the institutional strengthening of municipalities and management of urban problems through the existing municipal development loans, which include
support of city development plans. A possible LIL for small city capacity could lead to a
broader program of support in this critical area. WBI is focusing on public sector management, including management of smaller municipalities with support designed to complement
and leverage the impact of other Bank-supported interventions. An ongoing Bank study is
analyzing improved options for the financing of municipal investments.
(c) The Bank is supporting the Government in its effort to improve financial management and
accountability through an IDF Grant for financial management, disbursements and auditing.
The grant supports training and study tours for Government officials, a restructuring program
of relevant entities, and improved financial asset/liability management. The Bank is also supporting a Country Financial Management Overview, which includes a diagnostic exercise to
identify good practice and weak spots in the areas of planning and budgeting, disbursement,
accounting and auditing. This Overview will cover the Federal Government and three states
and will lead to the identification of next steps for improving the financial management
framework. In the area of public sector governance, transparency and accountability, WBI
could follow up with support if requested by the Government.
(d) Exploratory non-lending work in the area of governance would focus on linkages with economic efficiency, competitiveness, and service delivery to the poor. Case studies on governance and service delivery are one possibility. Possible support in the area of judicial reform,
crime and violence would be explored through workshops or possibly other non-lending
services.

126. In the environment area, the Bank would continue to focus on areas with a strong overlap
between environmental, poverty reduction, and growth objectives (water and sanitation, water
resource management, soil conservation, and pollution management). In the core environmental
areas where benefits are more diffuse or long term, and political support more uneven, the Bank's
program has two objectives: (i) to increase the strategic focus of ongoing environmental activities, especially in the area of ecosystem protection, and (ii) to assist Government to decentralize
environmental management and support emerging environmental constituencies. In these areas,
the Bank would support Government leadership in important ongoing initiatives and position itself for possible broader opportunities with a larger program.
(a) The Bank would continue its strong involvement in water resource management as an area
also important to growth, especially in the water-scarce Northeast, but also poverty reduction
through improved potable water supply and increased rural incomes. The Bank's involvement
aims at improving the legal and institutional framework for efficient, integrated, and decentralized water resource management. The Bank would focus on lending to states and for selected multi-states river basins. Sector work on a new irrigation model is nearing completion
and could support development of a corresponding project. The Bank would also assist with

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

further efforts to improve soil conservation and land management following on the successful experience with micro-basin management projects.
Box 6: The Rain Forest Pilot Program
The Rain Forest Pilot Program (PPG7), executed by the Brazilian Government, Brazilian civil society and
the Bank, is at an important turning point after four years of project implementation.* Although less than
half of the Program's pledged US$340 million in grant funding has been spent, there have been noteworthy
achievements listed below. Program participants (federal and state governments, donors, NGO networks,
and the Bank) are now committedto building on these results to guide the remaining half of the pilot phase.
At the 1999 Participants' Meeting, there was joint agreement on a decision to increase Government leadership in the management of the Program and to expand its policy focus beyond the Ministry of Environment.
Achievements of the program to date include:
Experimentation and Demonstration
*

Funding demonstration projects in some 120 communities and organizationsto experiment with new
approaches to using and conserving natural resources in the rain forests;

*

Training more than 12,000 people from 322 municipalities in fire prevention through a partnership
between civil society organizationsand the Government;

Conservation
*

Establishing and consolidating four extractive reserves, totaling 2 million hectares (ha.), in the Amazon;

*

Demarcating and legalizing almost 22 million ha. of lands inhabited by indigenous people, often with
the active participation of the indigenouspeople themselves and of specialized NGOs;

*

Introducing and gaining wide acceptance for the concept of rain forest corridors, networks that link
protected areas and the buffer zones around them;

Institutional Strengthening
*

Building state-level capacity for natural resource management in the nine states of the legal Amazon;

*

Supporting the creation of strong NGO networks in the Amazon and Atlantic rain forests;

*

Encouraging public-private partnerships around specific products to be produced under innovative,
sustainable conditions in the Amazon and the Atlantic rain forests; and

Scientific Research
*

Investing US$14 million in infrastructureto modernize two important scientific centers in the Amazon (the Emilio Goeldi Museum in Belem and the National Institute for Amazon Research - INPA) in
Manaus and funding 23 research projects.

Contributors to the Prograrn include, in order of the size of their contributions, Germany, European Union, United Kingdom, Brazilian Government, United States, Brazilian communities, Netherlands, Japan,
Italy, France, Canada.
*

(b) The comerstone of Brazil's strategy for ecosystem protection is the GEF/Bank-supported
PRONABIO project which, through a series of workshops, is in the process of developing
priority actions for biodiversity protection in each of Brazil's major biomes. Thus far workshops have been held for the Cerrado, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest, and most recently the Amazon. The Brazilian Government has informed the Bank that they would like to prepare GEF
projects to protect each of these biomes.
(c) Ecosystem protection is most advanced forAmazonia, where the Bank is supporting the development of three important instruments for biodiversity protection. These are the Amazon
Protected Areas project, the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rainforest's (PPG7)
Corridors project, and ESW on forest policy. The Amazon Protected Areas Project is the re-

Page 40

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

sult of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's commitment to join the WWF's "Forests for
Life" campaign and strictly protect a representative 10% of Brazil's forest ecosystems. As
part of the Bank/WWF Forest Alliance, possible GEF support could put an additional 25 million hectares of the Amazon into conservation status. The PPG7 corridors project is hoped to
eventually put as much as 30% of the Amazon into conservation-oriented use. It is expected
to link the 10% of the Amazon put into strict conservation through a series of buffers of extractive reserves, tree crops, and other land use conducive to biodiversity protection. Finally,
the Bank's ESW in forest policy, carried out in close partnership with Government and the
Brazilian research NGO IMAZON, is helping to develop options for a forest policy consistent
with maintaining Amazon forest land in its highest value use, generating employment in sustainable activities in appropriate areas of the Amazon, and reinforcing the emerging biodiversity strategy.
(d) In the Amazon and the Mata Atldntica the donor-financed Rainforest Pilot Program (see
Box 6) will continue to be a key instrument to involve local communities and decentralize,
where appropriate, environmental decision-making to state and local levels. Recently the
Bank has joined with the Brazilian Governmentto champion a stronger leadership role for the
Brazilian Government in this program, as well as simplified financing arrangements, and increased use of phased, APL-type financing of projects. These proposals are intended to better
align the Program and Brazilian Government policy and eliminate the dissipation of social
capital which had been occurring through long delays between (participatory) preparation and
availability of financing for implementation. The Bank's broader environmental assistance
program (including ecosystem protection, pollution management and institutional strengthening) increasingly draws from and builds on the experiences of the Rainforest Pilot Program.
(e) Helping Government decentralize environmental policy, including the management of urban pollution issues, and support local constituencies is an important part of the Bank's long
term environmental strategy. The recently approved Second National Environment Project, a
10 year APL, aligns local incentives to protect key local and regional environmental assets
with state-level institutional strengthening and policy reform related to both green and brown
environmental issues. At the same time, concerns related to decentralized environmental
management are being incorporated in Bank work in related sectors such as water and sanitation. Decentralized environmental management is also a core area for WBI support in Brazil.
Specifically, the Bank (including WBI, bilateral and private donors) supports an international
clean-air initiative with Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo as participant cities.
(f) Options for an expanded environmental assistance program would include possible forest

sector lending, programs to support sustainable activities that increase the income of the local
populations in forested areas that are not yet subject to heavy deforestation pressures, and
possible support to prevent desertification in the semi-arid areas of Brazil.
(g) Through the implementation of Montreal Protocol, GEF, and the Rainforest Pilot Program
projects, the Government and the Bank are gathering valuable experiences related to international environmental issues. In line with its concern for the international public-good aspects related to some environmental issues, the Bank can facilitate international resource
transfers and implementation of international agreements through which Brazil would continue to provide important positive international externalities, for example through the recently created Prototype Carbon Fund.
127. There are some cross-sectoral issues and themes that are incorporated in all facets of the
work program:
(a) Substantive participation of community associations in the implementation of several Bank

financed projects has been a major success factor in land reform, rural poverty as well as wa-

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page 41

ter and sanitation and urban upgrading projects. Increasingly, community associations not
only participate in projects but are their main actors who themselves receive the project funds
and implement the project activities. Importantly, this approach has been shown not only to
produce more sustainable project results at lower costs, but also to contribute to the formation
of social capital, empowering participants to gain benefits not originally associated with the
project. This approach will be continued and possibly expanded.
(b) A recent gender review undertaken by the Bank confirms that Brazil has progressed significantly in addressing gender issues and reducing gender gaps. Women's access to and use of
contraceptives has increased significantly. Education levels of women have increased to the
point that, on average, women now have more schooling than men. Women's labor market
participation has steadily increased over the last two decades and the wage gap between men
and women has also decreased. Remaining challenges include the need to improve health
services, in particular pre-natal care for pregnant women, and availability of early childhood
care and education programs, as well as the importance of reducing gender stereotypes. The
gender review will permit the Bank to better support the gender dimension in the design and
implementation of projects not only in health but also in education, urban development, water
and sanitation and other areas. It suggests careful attention to different targeting mechanisms
that are capable of effectively reaching women and men, as well as girls and boys. It also
suggests increased attention to the effective participation of women in consultative processes
and community associations, which have taken on a fundamental role in several Bankfinanced projects.
(c) The Bank emphasizes careful development impact evaluation, and in particular poverty impact evaluation where appropriate, built into projects and activities, which are supported by
the Bank. Some recent projects support rigorous evaluation studies based on household surveys exclusively conducted for the evaluation. Where feasible, these evaluations are designed
to generate policy implications not just for a specific project but a broader Government program. Particular emphasis is given to the generation of data that permits more systematic
comparative analysis of the poverty reduction impact of different types of projects.
(d) Supported through the implementation team located in Brasilia, the Bank puts increased emphasis on strengtheningfinancial management and auditing for all Bank-financedprojects in
order to ensure high standards with regard to financial management and accountability. New
projects undergo systematic analysis of financial management, procurement, and disbursement. For selected ongoing projects, the implementation team undertakes procurement audits,
ex-post reviews, and financial management assessments. The field-based team provides direct
assistance to clients through, among others, seminars and extensive training programs supported through IDF Grants.
Lending Scenarios, Risks, and Triggers
128. Lending, both for adjustment and investment purposes, will need to be consistent with net
debt targets at all levels. As discussed before, the Government aims at reducing the debt/GDP
ratio to 46.5% by the year 2001. The size of investment lending for federal and state governments
will depend on progress toward the debt targets and on the fiscal space for investments created by
fiscal reforms within the primary surplus targets agreed for the next years. Finally, satisfactory
performance of the existing portfolio is an important condition for a large lending program.
129. The base case provides for regular lending of up to US$5bn for the three year period
FY2000-2002. This could include regular adjustment lending (to the Federal Government or
states) of up to US$2bn, provided satisfactoryprogress is made on: (i) social security reform, (ii)
state fiscal reform, (iii) reforms that increase the quality, the sustainability and the social impact
of fiscal adjustment, and/or (iv) reforns of the financial sector and the regulatory environment for
growth, trade, and private sector development. Adjustment loans would be justified on fiscal and

Page 42

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

balance of payments grounds, and in the context of a satisfactory assessment of the Government's
macroeconomic program by the IMF. The scenario underlying this base case would be a continuation of macroeconomic progress with further advances on the reform agenda and tight fiscal
constraints accompanied by unavoidable external uncertainty. This scenario could include periods
of improving external conditions resulting in renewed capital inflows but also periods of uneven
progress in the pursuit of the reform agenda. The result would be continued but declining vulnerability to external shocks.32
130. Brazil's economic and social performance remains vulnerable to both internal and external
risks. Possible internal risks include legal challenges to recent reforms, delays in the approval of
key measures in Congress, complacency in the implementationof largely approved administrative
reforns, and slow progress with regard to social security reformn.The Government has demonstrated that it can effectively manage and compensate for setbacks to the reform program. Yet,
such developments can lead to deterioration in international confidence on account of concern
about the medium-term sustainability of fiscal adjustment, leading to a period of at best modest
macro-economic performance. This scenario would define the low case with regular lending for
FY2000-2002 up to US$3bn. This case would require a restructuring of the portfolio and a
smaller lending program limited to the two core objectives of Bank assistance - poverty reduction
(in particular, education, health, land reform, infrastructurefor the poor, and social safety net) and
fiscal adjustment. NLS would be stepped up to keep the dialogue on reforms active and help provide some of the analytical underpinnings for reforms once the Government is able to move
again.
131. Turning to external risks, international financial markets could suffer new disturbances,
further complicating the domestic adjustment process. If Brazil suffers again from lack of access
to international capital markets as a result of external factors, the Bank would consider a Government request for renewed special assistance beyond the lending program discussed in this
CAS at the appropriate time taking account of headroom considerations of the Bank3 3 Additional
lending at special terms would be designed to support the Government's program of relevant
structural reforms and would complement IMF financial support based, in turn, on the Government's macro-economic program. Financial support from the Bank would also go together with a
satisfactory Government response to the social protection aspects of a renewed crisis situation.
This response could consist of spending floors on social protection programs and/or additional
spending on social protection programs, which could be supported through some combination of
additional Government spending, additional investment lending, or restructuring of ongoing projects.
132. Bank exposure in the maximum lending base case (US$3bn in investment lending,
US$2bn in regular adjustment lending, and US$1.5bn in special adjustment lending, for FY200002) is assessed in the scenario underlying Annex B7. The exposure indicators reported cover total
debt and debt service to IBRD as well as total debt to multilateral international financial institutions (including Bank for International Settlements - BIS). Outstanding loans to Brazil would re32

main below US$1 lbn. The Bank's benchmark for debt service to international financial institutions would be exceeded in 2000 due to the heavy repayments of short term emergency lending
from these creditors in 1999; by 2001 the ratio would again fall below the benchmark.
133. Triggers cover fiscal, portfolio, and refonn performance. The primary surplus of the consolidated non-financial public sector (but including the Central Bank) is proposed as a measure of
fiscal effort. The Government's own targets with regard to this variable are proposed as the triggers for the base case. The ratio of public debt to GDP is proposed as a measure of fiscal outcomes, with the Government's target (46.5% in 2001) used as a trigger for the base case in 2001.
An intermediate target of 49% (2000) is proposed. Table 6 summarizes the triggers for the low
and base cases. In addition to these triggers, the Bank will closely observe the development and
expect a decline in the external debt to exports ratio, which reflects the extent to which the current
account deficit is financed by additional debt. The lending volume within the base case range
would be assessed on the basis of other indicators of external debt, including the debt service/exports ratio and the share of short-term borrowing, and on indicators of financial deepening,
including the ratio of gross public to total financial liabilities and the share of bank lending to the
public sector. With respect to the portfolio performance triggers, judgement would be used to determine whether Brazil should remain in the base case even if the indicated trigger of 15% of unsatisfactory projects was exceeded, especially if this is a direct and temporary consequence of
fiscal adjustment, and measures to restructure the affected loans are being taken.

134. IFC expects that its investments will continue to be constrained primarily by the Corporation's single-country exposure guidelines and will total approximately US$0.8-1.0 billion for
IFC's account over the FY2000-02 period. In view of continuing instability in external financial
markets, it is anticipated that mobilization of syndicated loans through IFC's loan "B" program
will also be lower than the previous three-year period, at between US$0.5 and US$1.0 billion.
Based on these considerations, IFC currently projects that its gross investments in Brazil will total
US$1.2-1.8 billion over the period.
135. MIGA is facing a severe capacity constraint given the increasing demand by foreign investors. As of December 31, 1999, registered applications were in excess of US$15 billion.
MIGA will have to be extremely selective in allocating its remaining capacity. It will leverage its
capacity by using its syndication program through the use of reinsurance and/or coinsurance
agreements with private insurers, and multilateral and bilateral institutions. In addition MIGA is

Page 44

also seeking various alternatives to increase its Brazil capacity, notably by raising its country
limits as well as looking into the creation of a Brazil guarantee fund.

Annex 1: IBRD Portfolio Performance
1. The Brazil program has been among the 4-5 largest in the World Bank. In FY99, the investment loans portfolio ranked third behind China and India in terms of value (current commitments
of US$7.9 billion) and fourth in number of loans (66). The US$930m in investment loan disbursements ranked third-among the Bank's clients. Including SECALs, Brazil's US$1.7 billion in
disbursements ranked second behind Argentina.
Brazil is the only country where the Bank lends directly to states: In FY99, the 35 state loans
represented 51% of the total portfolio or 41% in terms of value. State lending is desirable owing
to the decentralization of significant responsibilities mandated in the 1988 Constitution and the
greater efficiencies often possible from ownership and customizing operations to the needs of
individual states and their municipalities.
Historically, the Brazilian program declined precipitously from 1990 as the economic crisis of
that period deepened, hitting a low in 1994-5 (see Table 7). A combination of the Real Plan and a
major portfolio management effort on the part of the Bank and Government resulted in recovery
to record lending and disbursement levels in FY97-98.

Disbursement Performance
In FY97 the Brazil portfolio set a record US$1.6 billion in disbursements. In FY98 this figure fell
slightly to US$1.3 billion. Disbursements of investment loans in FY99 totaled US$930, still very
high compared to pre FY97 levels. However, owing to 1998-9 financial crisis and the subsequent
devaluation, Brazil saw a marked decline in disbursement performance in the second half of
FY99-only US$290m was disbursed in the second semester. Disbursements in the first four
months of FY00 are at record lows, averaging US$30m/month or about 32% of the equivalent
figure for FY99. Current projections result in FY00 disbursements from investment loans totaling
US$550-600m.
Low disbursements are a direct result of the fiscal/economic crisis affecting the Federal and State
Governments and the measures that have been undertaken to manage indebtedness and liquidity
and meet fiscal adjustment targets. The decline in disbursements is due in large part to restrictions
on Bank and Brazilian Federal loan counterpart funds (caps on Bank loan funding are now much
more stringent and linked to the underlying budget allocation in Reais) which went into effect
with the Federal budget of CY99. States' fiscal problems also affect direct state loan disbursements, and disbursement performance of the state and Federal portfolios has been about equally
poor in the second half of FY99. In addition, the devaluation will impact the future US$ value of
disbursements. Special accounts are now oversized and will have to be reduced.

Page II

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Disbursement Management
The Bank has taken a number of steps in response to the low disbursements. These include the
following.
(a) Country Assistance Reviews (CAR). In September 1999, the Bank met with Government
counterparts to decide upon actions for low disbursing loans including closing, partial cancellation, temporary counterpart funding adjustment, extension and revision of disbursement
profiles. If disbursement problems continue, a schedule of gradual and partial cancellations
would be activated. A second CAR will be held in April-May 2000 to assess interim results.
(b) Lending Program Reduction. The Bank lent only US$675m in FY99 for investment operations compared to lending levels of US$1.62b, US$1.Olb, and US$930m for 1998-96 respectively. We are projecting roughly US$900m for this year. Also, the Bank does not lend to
states (or ministries) that have poorly performing portfolios.
(c) Reduction in Loan Size. The average size of Brazil loans is around US$123m, low among
the Bank's large borrowers. However, there has been a marked tendency towards even
smaller loans, LILs, APLs, and loan phasing in an effort to accommodate Brazil's fiscal austerity program and reduce indebtedness. As a consequence, the FY00 pipeline average for
ten investment operations is US$88 million and seven of the loans are below US$100m, including a LIL and four APLs or phased operations.
(d) Project Implementation Team. The Bank has invested in a full service team covering financial management, disbursement and procurement that provides support to task managers and
clients to facilitate project implementation.
Portfolio Performance
In FY94 a third of the 63 Brazil portfolio loans were rated "unsatisfactory". The turnaround in the
portfolio has been complete and sustained. FY99 closed with 7 loans "at risk" including 5 "U", 3
of which had not yet been signed. At the moment, five loans are rated "unsatisfactory" and another 16 are on an "at risk" list meaning that they are candidates for restructuring, partial cancellation, closing and/or close monitoring.
It is important to note that the slowdown in disbursement does not necessarily imply reduced
project performance in terms of development impacts. Many projects are proceeding as scheduled, however, disbursements in dollar terms are reduced because of the devaluation. In these
cases, there should be no negative effect on development impact. In other cases, fiscal constraints
have forced reprogramming of projects leading to a delay but not reduction in the desired development impact.

Annex 2: IFC Portfolio
1. As of June 30, 1999, IFC had outstanding committed investments in 69 companies in Brazil
with a total exposure amount of US$2.37 billion including US$1.28 billion for its own account
(net exposure) and US$1.09 billion from commercial bank Participants. Total disbursed portfolio
as of the same date was US$2.15 billion including loans and equity investments for IFC's own
account of US$856.4 million and US$233.3 million respectively and loans from participants totaling 1.06 billion.
2. IFC's investment in Brazil covers a broad range of sectors. On a volume basis, food and agribusiness, chemicals and petrochemicals, infrastructure and general manufacturing are the sectors
with the highest level of IFC's Investment (see Table 8).

3. IFC's portfolio is of high quality and has managed to withstand the economic difficulties experienced by Brazil over the last 18 months. As of June 30, 1999, only 3.64% of IFC's loan portfolio was in non-accrual status and the interest collection rate was a good 96.29 %. These indicators compare favorably with the non-accrual rate of 11.1% and interest collection rate of 89.5%
for the total IFC portfolio.
Implementation
4. IFC's activity in Brazil over 1997-1999 has been consistent with the country strategy articulated in the previous CAS. Actual approval volume was US$2,718 million, compared to an indication of US$1,500-3,000provided in the last CAS.
5. The CAS had indicated that IFC expected approximately half of this amount to come from
mobilization of funds from banks and institutional investors. In fact, US$1.7 billion of the toal
US$2.7 billion of approvals was accounted for by the "B" loan program, allowing IFC to reduce
its own account financing over the CAS period to US$1.0 billion.
6. The distribution of these investments also followed the priorities set out in the CAS, and confirmed in the CAS update. Strategic priorities highlighted in the CAS included: private infrastructure; capital market development; middle market financing; and investments in the northeast
states. The subsequent CAS update also noted the growing importance of private investment in
the social sectors. Table 9 illustrates the sectoral distribution of IFC investment over the CAS
period.

7. In addition, there was IFC advisory activity in infrastructure, notably: (i) privatization of the
state power utility (COELCE), concessioning of an independent power project, and advice on
multi-sectoral regulatory framework in a northeast state of Ceara; and (ii) advice on a BOT (build
operate and transfer) concession for a Sao Paulo Metro project, which is expected to be cofinanced by IBRD. Presently ongoing are two other projects in the Northeast: assistance in privatization of bulk water treatment system in the State of Ceara and a BOT concession for a port in
the State of Pemnambuco.
8. In the Northeast states, IFC invested US$129 million over the previous CAS period, primarily
in agribusiness, manufacturing and services. The Corporation's new office in Ceara is supporting
this facet of IFC's strategy.

Annex 3: MIGA Activities
1. As of December 31, 1999 Brazil is the largest host country for MIGA insured investments
accounting for 13% of MIGA's total gross exposure. MIGA's outstanding portfolio in Brazil consists of 25 contracts of guarantee for a total gross exposure of US$585 million (US$189 million in
the financial sector, US$175 million in infrastructure, US$58 million in manufacturing, US$15
million in oil and gas, and US$150 million in services), of which MIGA's net exposure amounts
to US$271 million. To date, the total of amount of foreign direct investment facilitated by MIGA
is above US$3 billion.
2. FY99 was a record year for MIGA in Brazil. MIGA issued 7 contracts of guarantee for a total
gross exposure of US$177 million, and a cumulative project cost of US$1.8 billion. This included
the first time use of MIGA's Cooperative Underwriting and Facultative Reinsurance Program,
enabling MIGA to respond to an increasing demand given its own intemal capacity constraints.
MIGA's Brazil portfolio was diversified by issuing the first guarantees in the oil and gas and the
services industries. The oil and gas guarantee (US$14.5 million) was for the Brazil-Bolivia pipeline (total project cost: US$1.6 billion for the Brazilian side). A US$75 million guarantee in the
service industry was for the financing of a medical equipment leasing operation initially financed
by the IFC. MIGA issued two guarantees for a total coverage of US$75.5 million, another guarantee of US$75 million is expected to be issued by the second quarter of FY00. This was MIGA's
first operation reinsured by FMO, the Dutch bilateral agency.
3. Other guarantees during FY99 included: (i) three guarantees in the financial sector (a total
coverage of US$82 million for a total project cost of US$175 million) providing medium-term
financing on the Brazilian market; (ii) one in the manufacturing sector (US$5 million guarantee
for a total investment of US$50 million).
4. For FY00 MIGA faces a severe capacity constraint given the increasing demand by foreign
investors. As of December 31, 1999, registered applications were in excess of US$15 billion.
MIGA will be extremely selective in allocating its remaining capacity. It will leverage its capacity by using its syndication program through the use of reinsurance and/or coinsurance agreements with private insurers, and multilateral and bilateral institutions. In addition MIGA is also
seeking various altematives to increase its Brazil capacity.
5. So far in FY00, MIGA has issued three guarantees: one guarantee of US$65 million in a
power project, and one of US$100 million in a power project of US$4.1 billion, and one of
US$75 million for a medical equipment leasing operation. An additional US$100 million guarantee was co-insured with the IDB. Additional operations under consideration include two oil and
gas projects, and one telecom project.
6. MIGA's overall objectives in Brazil are to diversify its portfolio in accordance with the CAS
objectives, notably in water and sanitation, manufacturing, services, agroindustries, and projects
supporting the development of SMEs. Highly developmental projects in other sectors will also be
considered, as well as projects which will help alleviate Brazil's current account deficit. In addition to issuing guarantees for foreign investments in Brazil, MIGA will seek to issue guarantees
for Brazilian investments in other developing countries.

Annex 4: Poverty Profile and Trend
1. This Annex summarizes the recent poverty profile and poverty trends for Brazil to underpin
the discussion of poverty reduction strategies and policies in the main text of the CAS (paragraphs 9 ff.). More detailed data and discussion are provided in the Bank's forthcoming Urban
Poverty Strategy ESW report.3 4
Poverty Profile
2. Two approaches were used to gain a better understanding of who the poor are and what their
characteristics are. First, the poverty profiles contain a number of personal and professional characteristics of the head of household (age, race, gender, schooling, immigration, economic activity,
sector) and variables related to housing and urban services (housing situation, water, sewage, garbage and electricity). The profiles thus contain information on the poverty rate of each population
subgroup with the above characteristics and on the share of the poor of the respective subgroup in
total poverty. Second, probit regressions were run with variables including demographic, personal, housing and regional characteristics of the households. These probit regressions determine
the relation between each of the characteristics and poverty taking the effect of other characteristics into account. In both cases, the relations between poverty and population characteristics are
descriptive and should not be misinterpreted as causal relations.
3. The Poverty profile (Table 10) shows that poverty continues to be highly concentrated in the
Northeast: 63% of the country's poor live in the nine Northeastern states. Poverty rates are much
higher in rural areas with the result that the poor are about equally split between urban and rural
areas. Location (geographical region and degree of urbanization) is the strongest explanatory
variable for poverty. The fact that location remains powerful in explaining poverty after controlling for household characteristics (see Table I1), shows that even households with the same characteristics are more likely to be poor in poor than in rich areas. This implies that poverty in poor
areas is not just related to a larger number of households with characteristics that are related to
poverty (low education, large number of children, etc.) but that there is an independent effect of
the wealth of the area on poverty. People with the same characteristics are likely to be poorer in
poor areas.
4. Household size is strongly related with poverty. Poverty rates increase with the dependency
ratio (share of income earners over non income earners in the household). The probit analysis
shows household size as well as the share of children as strong independent explanatory variables
of poverty. The significant effect of household size remains even if reasonable parameters for
economies of scale at the household levels are considered (household equivalence scale parameter
between 0.7 and 1.0).
5. The strong negative relation between schooling and poverty is striking. Poverty rates fall
from 51% among those with less than one year of schooling to 5% for those with 8 to 12 years of
schooling. 73% of the poor live in households where the head of household has up to four years
of schooling only. It is important, however, to add that the probit analysis suggests that the quantitative effect of schooling is not as strong as location (or wealth of the areas, which is captured
by the location variable). For example, the move of a household from Fortaleza to Sao Paulo (an
area with 2.3 times higher per capita earnings) would have the same effect in terms of reducing
the probability of poverty as a hypothetical increase in the education of the head of household by
15.7 (!) years.

6. Race and gender of the head of household interestingly do not independently explain poverty.
Female headed households, in fact, show a slightly lower poverty rate than male headed households. While race does not independently explain poverty, black-headed households are three
times as likely to be poor as white-headed households. The 45% of black-headed households constitute 71% of Brazil's poor. This means that race is closely related to other explaining factors,
such as low levels of schooling and location in poor areas, but does not independently explain a
higher probability of poverty.
7. A large share of the poor work in the informal sector (21.8% informal employees and 42.6%
self-employed) or are inactive (8.6%). Employment status does not independently explain poverty. However, the unemployed, the self-employed and the informally employed have much
higher poverty rates. Most of the poor (80% overall, and 69% in urban areas) are economically
active but most of them outside of the formal sector. While the poverty rate among the unemployed is very high (42%), they make up only a small share of the poor (6%).
8. Most poor live in their own house on their own land. The poverty rate of those living in their
own house but not their own land (presumably irregular settlements) is very high but their overall
contribution to poverty small. It is also interesting to note that residence in afavelas is not significantly related to poverty. Finally, poverty rates are much higher among those households without
access to public services (water, sewage, garbage collection). Even though country-wide electrification rates are high, a quarter of the poor still live without access to electricity. 53% of the poor
have no piped water, 61% have no garbage collection, and 80% have neither sewage connection
nor septic tanks.

Poverty Trends over Time
9. The measurement of poverty trends in the inflationary environment before 1994 is fraught
with methodological challenges but nevertheless reveals an interesting relation between poverty
rates, macroeconomic events, and Govemment transfer programs. The poverty trend shown in
Figure 2 is derived from a monthly employment survey (PME), which covers only six metropolitan areas and captures only labor income. Due to the limitations of the PME, these measurements
are not comparable with the national poverty rate discussed before but are helpful to analyze
short-term and more recent fluctuations in poverty. The data shows a first peak in poverty in the
adjustment period between 1982-85. Poverty declined with the growth policies of 1985-86, which
included price freezes and lax fiscal and monetary policies. These policies were not sustainable
and resulted in a period of hyperinflation and intermittent stabilization attempts, which led to a
new peak in poverty in the early 1990s.
10. The Real Plan significantly reduced poverty and inequality levels from 1994 until 1997. This
beneficial effect was due to: (i) economic growth and rising real wages; (ii) the end of inflation
(salary erosion and inflation tax); (iii) a significant appreciation of the local currency shifting
prices toward the service sectors in which most poor work; and (iv) a significant increase in the
minimum wage to which important income sources, such as pensions, are tied.
11. The annual household survey (PNAD) covers the entire country (excluding the rural north)
and all income sources and provides a better basis for country-wide poverty analysis. Analysis of
the PNAD shows the same periods of rapid poverty reduction 1985/86 and 1994/95 as the PME,

Page X

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

however, the increase in poverty in the intermittent period is less pronounced leading to an overall more favorable poverty trend (see Figure 3). This difference can be explained by two related
factors. First, the areas surveyed and incomes covered by the PME are those most sensitive to
macroeconomic events (labor income in metropolitan areas). Second, Brazil has over the last
years introduced social transfer programs (such as rural pensions) that have made an important
contribution to poverty reduction but are not captured in poverty measurements derived from the
PME.
12. The succession of economic crises since 1997 has affected the poor mainly through reduced
labor demand and the resulting reduction in employment and/or real wages. Until the fall of 1998
(the date of the last available PNAD), annual poverty rates have been declining. More recent poverty measurements are available only from the PME with the important limitations already discussed above. According to PME poverty measurements, the headcount poverty rate in metropolitan areas dropped from a peak of 35.3% in July 1994 to a low of 24.6% in October 1997. The
rate increased continuously from November 1997 until March 1999, when it reached 30.0%. The
latest data through September 1999 shows a slight improvement in poverty rates to 28.6%, indicating a reversal in the negative crisis impact. It needs to be reiterated that data from the PME
most likely exaggerates the negative impact of the crisis since it is limited to six metropolitan areas (most likely the hardest hit areas) and excludes income from transfer programs which would
have compensated for some of the loss of labor income.

Dynamics of Poverty and Social Risks
13. Despite the lack of longitudinal data, the dynamics of poverty in Brazil is increasingly being
studied. The Monthly Employment Survey (PME) has a panel structure that permits the analysis f
short-term movements into and out of poverty. The analysis confirms the relatively large share of
the population that is moving into and out of poverty, thus confirming the importance of more
detailed dynamic poverty analysis.
14. Figure 4 shows the probabilities of workers moving in or out of poverty during episode of
growth and recession. It is striking how alike expansions look and how alike recessions look. This
analysis allows an evaluation of the potential for poverty reduction through economic growth
alone, at least for the metropolitan areas. During a period of expansion (A), a non-poor worker
without any education has historically had a 20-25 percent probability of falling into poverty one
year later (this probability was markedly lower during 1986-87). At the same time (C), an uneducated poor worker has about a 12 percent probability of exiting poverty. Looking now at recessions (B), we see that a non-poor worker without any education has had a 30-40 percent probability of falling into poverty. Meanwhile (D), an uneducated poor worker has had about a 10-15
percent probability of exit from poverty during recessions.

Annex 5: Private Sector Strategy
1. Introduction. As noted in this CAS, growth is critical not only to reduce poverty but also to
maintain support for the economic reform agenda. The first priority for growth is the continuation
of macroeconomic stability with declining interest rates, which in turn depends on fiscal adjustment. The second priority is further improvements in the environment for private sector development, which include improved access to financing, infrastructure and education investments, and
further reduction of the "Custo Brasil". In this context, financial support to private firms which
create growth will play a major role, particularly in the current state of domestic and external financial markets, whether in the form of direct financing or enhancements and insurance. Finally,
a priority will be supporting investments which help demonstrate that economic reforms enable
the private sector to deliver widely-felt improvements in standards of living. The World Bank
Group's (WBG's) Private Sector Strategy (PSS) focuses on the two latter priorities.
2. This PSS, which forms an integral part of the WBG's overall Country Assistance Strategy for
Brazil, further details the Bank Group's strategy in achieving these objecLives.The first part of the
PSS provides a diagnosis of the principal impediments to private sector-led growth for Brazil,
which forms the basis for the strategy; the second part of the PSS details the WBG's strategy for
addressing these impediments.
Impediments to Private-Sector Led Growth in Brazil
The Brazilian Private Sector under the Plano Real
3. Performance under the Real Plan, and after the devaluation. Since the introduction of the
Plano Real, the environment for Brazil's private sector has undergone a number of major
changes, which have both produced shocks and altered incentives. The initial stabilization, and
reduction in inflation enabled producers to contemplate, for the first time in years, fixed investments with a long-term payoff under stable scenarios. Relative prices across sectors underwent
significant adjustment with the liberalization of trade. The boom in consumer demand which followed encouraged production. The defense of the currency using high real interest rates and the
subsequent recession led to a reduction in demand, while at the same time beginning to raise the
cost of investments in late 1997 and through 1999. Subsequent to the January 1999 devaluation,
there was another significant adjustment between domestic and external prices.
4. Less downside than feared. One of the most visible aspects of the post-devaluation Brazilian
private sector has been the absence of widespread crisis. Particularly in the aftermath of the East
Asian crisis, where devaluations led to a succession of private sector defaults which have paralyzed several economies, the resiliency of Brazilian firms has attracted much attention. The main
explanation for this is that low leverage among private firms has meant low levels of non3 5 Table 13 illustrates the conservative balance

5. Subsequent to the devaluation, there have been only two visible defaults on external obligations, that of Minas Gerais, and one media firm. Domestically, companies with large consumer
credit (retail, appliances) have been hurt by the recession, but this has not spilled over into other
sectors in any systematic fashion. In turn, this has meant that (again in contrast to the East Asian
experience), there has been little effect on the banking system.
6. But also limited upside. Yet, while the absence of major bad news is certainly positive, good
news to date has been confined to macro-economic stability, particularly elimination of inflation,
and the absence of good news on growth is an area of concern. Growth has been anemic (although the recession in 1999 has certainly been less deep than anticipated), as illustrated byTable

7. There has also been a limited export response to date (though it has begun to improve in
1999). Contributing factors to this include the general 1999 recession in Latin America, especially in Argentina; low commodity prices; the time lag to develop new export markets; and a
lack of long-term financing (discussed further below).

8. Restructuring of the private sector. The real sectors of the economy have seen significant
efficiency gains in spite of a weak external environment. Most of these productivity gains appear
to have come from reduction in employment (especially in the case of privatization), along with
increases in economies of scale and management improvements in several sectors. In this respect,
capital scarcity has acted as a major catalyst of change. Its positive aspects include forcing more
focus on financial planning and capital structures than was the case before, and also forcing many
ineffective players out of business (or to sell their firms). However, capital scarcity has also posed
a major constraint on these more efficient firms to then modernize plant and equipment or expand
to meet external competition or take advantage of new opportunities opened by changes in relative prices.
9. In the financial sector, the Plano Real triggered a significant restructuring. The Brazilian
banking sector has undergone significant privatization, and has been consolidated, open to foreign
participation, and better capitalized. Central Bank supervision has also improved, including standards and inspection. Government programs to restructure the financial system and reduce the
state public sector (PROER and PROES) shifted much of burden of non-performing assets (over
R$100 billion) to Government. As a result, contrary to its counterparts in Asia, Brazil's banking
system has withstood the shock of a major devaluation, and so far appears to be weathering well
the recession. However (as discussed in detail below), lending remains very limited. In addition,
while many state-level banks have been privatized, the largest (BANESPA) still has to be, and
there remains a large Federal presence (see paragraph 14).
10. The impact of these changes, however, has been less evident than hoped for by the Government. There has been limited increase in production and exports to date, while the private sector
has yet to become as active as hoped for in newly opened areas.

11. Concentration, growth, and long-term political risk. All observers in Brazil note a growing concentration within Brazilian industry. Firms are consolidating: now, a company has to be
either huge, or highly focused. Medium-sized companies are stuck between large competitors
with scale, and small firms that often gain an advantage by avoiding fiscal charges. However,
even with this advantage, successful small firms can rarely expand rapidly to become generators
of significant new employment and long-term
growth, in large measure because of their inability to access capital. The Government has often
sought to channel resources to this segment, with In preparation for this CAS and PSS, IFC
only varying success. BNDES lines of credit and IBRD undertook consultationswith a

ten foreign firms who have better access to
capital in their home markets. This process can be observed in part through the tremendous
growth in both Foreign Direct Investment (other than that related to privatization), and Mergers
and Acquisitions (see paragraphs 34-36 below).
12. Further concentration is inevitable, unless the fiscal issue is solved, leading to a restarting of
intermediation to the private sector. This will have significant implications:
(a) As the consolidation progresses, the winners will be more likely to have external financial
access. An implication of the current "crowding out", therefore, is that growth will depend
largely on multinationals and large Brazilian firms which can obtain term funds offshore, in
order to modernize and compete.
(b) Another implication, confirmed in a series of meetings with private firms and financial institutions, is that there exists today in Brazil a huge repressed demand for investment, with firms
simply trying to hang on until capital costs drop below the hurdle rates for investment projects.
(c) The competitiveness of Brazil has increased, but more by decreasing employment than by
modemization of equipment. Therefore gains in productivity are having little impact on
growth today, and are not fully setting the stage for sustainable longer-term growth. Consolidation could also dampen domestic inter-firm rivalry, reducing incentives for competitiveness
in global markets.
(d) Finally, the changing profile of the private sector could lead to a perception that the reform
process has limited visible benefits to the general population. This could, in turn, weaken the
consensus behind reform-oriented economic policies.
13. The last implication is a particularly important one. In this respect, resumption of growth,
along with demonstrable examples that the private sector can use its new space for the benefit of
Brazilians in general, will have a critical role.

14. Public sector banks: a dominant, but declining, role. Reflecting earlier policies, public

sector banks play a major-in some cases dominant-role in Brazil's financial sector. This
should of course not obscure the very significant privatization of many banks in recent years.
However, Banco do Brasil (BoB), Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social
(BNDES), Caixa Economica Federal (Caixa), and Banco do Nordeste (BNB) are very large remaining public banks. BoB provides 85% of agricultural lending in Brazil, Cai-xa the majority of

housing finance, and BNB most credit in the Northeast. BNDES is the most active lender to industry, providing credit equivalent to nearly 2% of GDP.

15. As can be seen from these numbers, BNDES has played a vital role in financing private activity in the early years of the Plano Real. Its lending activity has surpassed that of the World
Bank Group's for the whole region, making it the largest development financial institution in
Latin America, and one of the largest in the world. Whether this model of financing the private
sector can be sustained, however, is in question. On the one hand, BNDES' own capacity to keep
up with the demand for financing from accelerating private sector activity is limited, asTable 16
indicates. This is in part due to the reduction in government expenditures which forms part of the
reform process, and of the difficult environment in international capital markets. At the same
time, BNDES' strategy has been shifting from financing of general industry to a focus on infrastructure, social services, and special facilities for exports and microlending. This leaves middlesized firms again with reduced access to capital.
16. Private sector banks. In Brazil, as in any open economy, access to financing is critical for
restructurings and for modernization. Expanding credit is needed to nourish economic growth
(within limits, of course). In Brazil, there exist plenty of originators and capital. The banking
system, as noted above in paragraph 9, has become much more solid, and some Brazilian banks
are among the largest in Latin America. And while savings rates are low, at 17% of GDP, only a
tiny proportion of savings are being intermediated to the private sector. Credit to the private sector is about 30% of GDP (down from 43% in 1980), and below the level of many developing
countries (see Figure 5). Apart from government-supported programs or institutions, term financing for the private sector is nil.

17. Brazil is in a classic "crowding out" scenario, with government borrowings displacing credit
to the private sector. Banks (correctly) decline to lend to risky private firms, when they can get
20% or higher returns, essentially risk-free, from investing in plentiflil government securities. The
system is intermediating to government, not to the productive sectors. This results in an effective
inability to access financing for all but blue chip companies, especially the medium-long-term
financing critical for financing investment.
18. In economic terms, this yields inefficient capital structures in the private sector, creates large
misallocations of resources, and works to the disadvantage of Brazilian producers. While limited
leverage is a good thing in times of crisis, it constrains the ability to move into areas of opportunity when the crisis abates, as is the case today in Brazil. Capital scarcity hampers capitalintensive industries, the financing of concessions and infrastructure expansions, and mortgage
and personal financing. Any improvement could be expected to result in a major jump in investment and growth.
19. Interest rates. Interest rates area at the heart of the problem of why so little investment lending is occurring in Brazil. Nominal base interest rates have ranged as high as 40% over the past
two years, and have only briefly come below 20% (see Figure 6). These rates reflect the government's large fiscal deficit, and its need to offer high rates to finance the deficit. On-lending rates
from banks in turn add spreads for operating costs, Central Bank reserve requirements, and perceived risk premiums to the base rates. Rates on consumer credits range as high as 5.5% to 12%
per month. At this level of rates, it would be difficult to see any significant lending occurring.

20. The Government has been seeking ways to improve this situation. To some extent, the change
in exchange rate policy has allowed for a drop in domestic interest rates. The Central Bank has
cut the benchmark overnight rate from 45% earlier in 1999 to 19%36 but it remains high, especially given inflation of below 10% per annum. Reserve requirements are also being adjusted
downwards, and eliminated for demand deposits. The financial transactions tax has also been cut
by 75%. These latter steps should have an impact on lending/deposit spreads, though not on base
interest levels themselves.
21. As noted above, absence of lending reflects rational behavior on the part of banks, and induces capital scarcity which has several important effects. Aside from the effects on growth, this
severely constrains the development of housing finance, an area with significant potential for
broadly sharing benefits of reform.
22. Other impediments. A number of observers point to other aspects of why intermediation to
the private sector is not taking place. Among these are:
36

Interest rates are now set in the context of an inflation targeting policy framework.

Page XVIII

(a) Erratic and unpredictable movements in rates have contributed to short-term perspective of
both banks and borrowers.
(b) Credit information is scarce.
(c) Banks lack credit experience and culture. Many are very conservative, used to focusing on
treasury management and investment in government securities.
(d) Second tier companies continue to suffer from corporate governance issues.
(e) Enforcement of security is near-impossible. Judicial discretion invariably favors continuation,
even in event of defaults (although there is a new foreclosure law which improves prospects
for mortgage finance). Bankruptcy rules put secured credits after workers' payments, taxes,
social security and expenses. Furthermore, bankruptcy procedures are quite debtor-friendly,
allowing, for example, solvent debtors to easily obtain a moratorium on payments. Even
leased equipment cannot be recovered easily and must go through the courts.
(f) There is significant taxation of the financial sector. Estimates are that these taxes add 200
basis points or more to the lending costs for a (domestic) AAA borrower.
23. While unmet demand for housing is large, in the short-run high interest rates are preventing
the emergence of a deep housing finance market. In general, the supply of housing loans has declined in recent years and the main market-based source of housing finance today is developers,
with a formal housing finance market virtually absent. There is a large role for Caixa, which was
(and is) largely funded through compulsory (savings, social security and other) contributions.
Work on housing finance is underway in the Bank analyzing the general issue of lack of housing
from various angles. This includes Land and Housing Markets ESW, Reform of the Housing Finance and Mortgage Markets and Financing Municipal Services.
24. External debt financing. Along with weak domestic intermediation, dependence on external
financing is an area of difficulty for Brazil's private sector. With gross domestic savings at 19%
of GDP in 1998, and the public sector deficit at 8% of GDP, private investment rates of 18% of
GDP, require external financing of 7% of GDP. This is to say nothing of the levels of investment
typically seen as necessary to drive sustained growth levels of 5-6% or higher. A similar dependence throughout the region fueled the boom in demand for private external capital when these
markets re-opened after the 1995 Peso Crisis. In the case of Brazil, the country's higher risk rating, relative to the other large Latin American economies, accounted for a somewhat later entry
into private foreign capital markets, and a lower importance of this source of capital, than for
some of its neighbors. Within this aggregate volume, Foreign Direct Investment (see paragraph
34 below) plays the largest role.
25. Notwithstanding this relatively lower use of international capital, large Brazilian firms and
banks did begin to borrow more from external sources at the peak of international capital flows,
only to find access largely cut off after the Russian crisis. Gross private external debt flows in
1998 were estimated at US$29 billion or 3.6% of GDP, and are estimated to be half this amount
in 1999. Net private external debt flows for 1999 were probably negative. This constitutes a significant set-back for two areas in particular: infrastructure, and middle-market firms. In the case
of infrastructure, the financing of large private sector concessions relies extensively on obtaining
financing from the international capital markets (as has been the case for large private infrastructure investments in all emerging markets), and the effects of the disruption in external financial
markets can be seen in the failure of many concessions in Brazil to reach financial closure on
their investment programs. In the case of middle market firms, the recent progress made in modernization of Brazilian industry is critical to maintain for export growth to materialize, and some
of this investment had been financed via external borrowings of Brazilian banks, who now can no
longer access funds as they did in late 1997 and early 1998.

26. Under today's market conditions, with access alternately closed (when bad news occurs) and,
if open, only for top-quality credits (a phenomenon not limited to Brazil or to emerging market
borrowers), the ability of Brazil's private sector to borrow extemally will remain minimal, and
limited to a few blue chip companies and banks for short maturities at high rates. This implies
that in the near future extemal market conditions will exacerbate, rather than alleviate, the capital
scarcity driven by high domestic interest rates in Brazil.
27. Equity Markets. Brazil's stock market, with a capitalization of US$160 billion, is one of the
largest among emerging markets. However, relative to the size of the Brazilian economy, equity
markets in Brazil are quite small (see Figure 8).

28. Equity markets are also not sufficiently developed to be a remedy for the scarcity of debt
capital. Stock markets are insignificant as a source of new capital, as shown in Figure 9.

29. Demand for primary offerings is practically non-existent. There are a number of reasons for
this, which have been explored in some depth. Currently, it is not attractive to invest in Brazil as a
minority investor. As a result, valuations are low, in turn repressing any supply of quality shares.
Brazil also has a well-noted tradition of closed companies and secrecy. In spite of capital scarcity,
many firms have recently chosen to de-list. This illustrates that in Brazil the perceived value of
publicly listed shares, in terms of improving access to capital, is not sufficient to overcome traditional concerns about sharing information and control. Minority shareholders' rights have been a
well-publicized issue, particularly with non-voting shares which are so prevalent in Brazil. Minority shareholders (domestic and international) in Brazilian companies are recommending
changes to the Companies Act in two areas: limiting the percentage of non-voting shares and requiring tender offers in changes of control.
30. Institutional investors, who are in many countries a force for improving corporate governance, have a more limited role in Brazil than in countries where pension systems have been privatized. To some extent these types of investors are appearing in concessions, which will contribute to making management more robust. These investors represent a large pool of potential longterm capital for investment, as there has been a large growth in pension assets under management,
as shown in Figure 10.
Figure 10: Brazilian Pension Funds, Portfolio Growth, in US$ Billion

120/

31. However, assets under private management are low. Development of pension funds as
sources of long-term finance will depend on social security reform. Currently, few pension funds
are open to public entry. Moreover, there is a lack of professional fund managers.

32. Non-bank financing. In most economies, smaller firms tend to rely on a number of non-bank
sources of credit whose focus allows them to contemplate more readily the risk levels associated
with small business credit. Factoring, leasing and micro-lending are three examples of this type of
financing which is relatively common in certain economies, but scarce in Brazil. Indeed, nonbank intermediation accounts for a very small share of financial activity in Brazil, even though
bank lending itself is at low levels.

33. Microlending. Another area of relative weakness, insofar as the ability to support growth is
concerned, is micro-lending. Microlending is playing a major role in neighboring Bolivia. In Brazil, microlending has drawn increasing attention but is relatively undeveloped with only a few
programs of significant scale functioning (notably in the Northeast). Their combined outstanding
portfolio is under US$20 million, or 0.003% of GDP. The largest Bolivian microlender, by contrast, has a portfolio equivalent to 0.8% of GDP. In addition, the main Bolivian microlenders (as
is the case now in many countries) are either fully private or managed along purely commercial
lines, as evidenced by high profitability, whereas the most prominent Brazilian efforts in this area
are public sector and/or donor-driven. Both IDB, which has provided a US$300 million loan to
BNDES for microlending, and IBRD are seeking to support efforts in this area.
34. Foreign Direct Investment. One bright spot in the financial picture has been Foreign Direct
Investment. Over the past two years, Brazil has been able to achieve an impressive inflow of FDI
in excess of US$20 billion annually.

35. In 1997 Brazil was declared "recipient country of the year" among Latin American countries. While most of these flows have been related to Brazil's highly successful privatization program, this has not been the whole story. Long-term equity investors continue to see Brazil's large
domestic market as an attractive destination. Non-privatization FDI has been climbing sharply,
and can be expected to continue to do so with: (a) the post-devaluation lowering of Brazilian asset
prices, (b) the implementation of post-privatization investment plans, especially in infrastructure
where many of the winning bidders are foreign firms, and (c) the continuing lack of alternative
financing sources for Brazilian firms.
36. Mergers and Acquisitions. A very visible, and to some extent unique, phenomenon which
has been occurring in Brazil under the Plano Real, is the tremendous growth in Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A). Both FDI and M&A have effectively been acting as substitutes for absent
credit. In the absence of credit, firms have either retrenched, relied on their cash flow, or sought
partners with access to capital (the latter generally at the cost of control of their business). For
many firms, the economies of scale which are increasingly needed to compete can only be obtained through mergers. A positive aspect of this has been that M&As often facilitate acquisition

Page XXII

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

of updated technology. However, several participants in this activity see the wave of M&A driven
by arbitrage between foreign and domestic interest rates, as much as by fundamental business
opportunities. The decreased cost of assets which has stimulated acquisitions improves efficiency,
but rarely leads to expansion of productive capacity.
37. Multilateral agencies. Given the lack of market access, both domestic and external, multilateral and bilateral agencies can play a critical role in assisting the private sector at this critical
juncture. Both IFC and the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank (IDB)'s private sector group have
mobilized important funds for Brazil's private sector.

38. IDB's direct financing of the private sector is limited to infrastructure investments (IFC and
IDB have one joint investment, as yet undisbursed, in the roads sector). IFC's US$2.7 billion of
financing for the private sector, while small relative to aggregate private capital flows, has been a
major piece of available long-term debt capital for Brazilian manufacturing and service firms.
Unfortunately, IFC's ability to maintain these levels of financing is in doubt, given capital and
single-country exposure constraints, as discussed further below. MIGA's operations in Brazil
have also expanded substantially in Brazil, reaching US$177 million of new contracts in FY99
(see paragraph 83 below).
39. Multilateral agencies also have a potentially important role in the area of credit enhancement.
As is the case in other emerging countries, it is the debt flows that have been more affected by the
overall loss of confidence in emerging markets, and it is therefore debt markets that should be
targeted by any enhancement structure supported by the WBG. Risk perceptions about emerging
countries debt investments have shifted in the US and European markets as a result of losses in
Asia and mainly in Russia. Exposure to emerging markets are now closely scrutinized by banking
stock analysts, and often bundled together in a single risk category. International banking institutions are in the process of reassessing the risks/rewards of their lending activities. Meanwhile, the
situation in Latin America today is somewhat different from that in Asia in that there is a large
universe of creditworthy companies that are only moderately leveraged. There may, therefore be
a greater willingness on the part of international commercial banks to accept credit risks if some
form of mitigation can be provided for risks relating to the sovereign.
Custo Brazil
40. Infrastructure. Brazil has made significant, albeit uneven, progress in reducing the famous
Custo Brasil, of which infrastructure deficiencies form the most visible component. Original
estimates (see the previous WBG CAS/PSS for Brazil3 7 ) indicated that Brazil should expect to be
spending US$20 billion p.a., or close to 3% of GDP, in order to come up to the standards of some
of its main trade competitors, and to keep up with increased needs driven by economic growth
and advances in technology.

service and quality, resulting in improved services to the population. These gains, while not addressing a central part of the Custo
Brasil, clearly have widespread benefits, and improve the basis for sustained growth.
42. In contrast to the situation in communications and energy,transport gains remain uneven and
uncertain. Transport is the area which has generally been singled out as the source of the greatest
competitive disadvantage for Brazilian producers. The inefficiencies of Brazilianports were estimated to make shipping 27% more expensive than shipping from Argentine or Uruguayan ports.
A major program of improving Brazil's ports has had mixed results to date: port costs are still
high, though waiting times (which in many cases have a higher effective costs than actual port
charges) are down. An estimated US$0.3 billion has been invested to date by concessionaires.
Notable successes in reducing costs have also been achieved at some ports, such as Salvador,
where costs are now similar to those at Antwerp. However in Santos, Brazil's largest port, reductions have been more modest, and prices are high by international standards. The Ministry of
Transport projects ongoing investment requirements in the sector at US$0.6 billion per annum, of
which some 40% would come from concession contracts.
43. Railroads are another major constraint, though also an area where improvements are becoming visible. With the concessioning of Fepasa, all seven major rail networks have been concessioned, and significant improvements are beginning to be seen in the quality and costs of rail
services. According to the World Bank's PPI database, Brazil ranked second worldwide in terms
of numbers of private rail investments (after Argentina) as of end- 1997. Investments on the part
of new concessionaires of the railways are estimated to reduce grain transportation costs by between 15 and 33%, depending on the line and crop. CSN, a major steel-focused conglomerate
which invested in both port and rail concessions, reduced transport costs about 25% through reduction of over-employment, increased investment, and improved management. In both ports and
rails, IFC and the World Bank have played a significant role.
44. In spite of this progress, there remains a long way to go. Progress in roads has been particularly slow. A significant number of road concessions have been granted, covering about 6,000
miles, involving more than 30 concessionaires, and representing about US$15 billion in investment requirements. However, most investment programs associated with these concessions have
had difficulties reaching financial closure, and little of the required investments in upgrading and
expanding highways have been made. With the exception of the Via Dutra from Sao Paulo to Rio
de Janeiro (financed by IFC, and seen as a major success story), those concessions which have
progressed have done so with short-term funds, and several are facing concerns about refinancing

Page XXIV

debts in the current high-interest rate, low capital availability environment. Therefore, major bottlenecks remain in road transport, and major inefficiencies with regards to modes of transportation continue to exist, with a continued need to shift more road traffic to rail. In addition, the
August 1999 truckers' strike highlighted the sensitivity of the general public to inefficiencies in
transport, the difficulties of reforming the roads sector, and Brazil's disproportionate reliance on
road transport. Intermodal transportation has a key role in achieving further gains. The present
framework, in which private owners are now the ones focusing on logistics and best options,
rather than government, is appropriate.
45. Regulatory and other components. Some progress has certainly

which can result in significant delays and uncertainty and dampen investment. In addition, the relationship and respective roles of
CADE and sectoral regulatory authorities at the federal and state levels in areas such as the provision of infrastructure services can be better defined. Tax rates continue to be relatively high, and
while many simplifications have been introduced into the tax structure, Brazilian taxation remains
relatively more complicated than in most countries.
46. Labor productivity is another element of the Custo Brasil which has attracted attention.
Raising the quality of the labor force involves attention to be paid to the quality of educational
institutions, incentives and access to these by the unprivileged, and the coordination between the
output of these institutions and the private sector.These issues are systemic in nature, however,
training of the labor force can serve as a complement, and in this case, a substitute in the interim,
until the more structural causes can be addressed. In particular, firm-led training holds the key to
productivity increases. Firm-led training has been initiated in several countries (some through
WBG projects using matching grants on a sliding rule, tax incentives, and reform of vocational
training institutes) in the private sector on the premise that since firms make competitivenessinfluencing decisions (such as adoption of new technologies), they know best what their employees need training in.38 Vocational training institutes and technical training centers are usually
publicly funded in most countries, including Brazil. It is commonly found that firms pay a portion
of their taxes towards the operation of such institutes but are seldom found to be utilizing their
services, or even aware of their them. Making firms aware of the facilities and services offered by
such institutes and their role and rights in terms of access to these services often serves as an eye
opener. By creating an awareness on the part of firms, potential clients are created for the training

institutes, and the potential for streamliningtheir activities to serve the client needs is opened up.
Once again, since training institutes already exist, such interventions do not pose an additional
burden on the public budget and retain their fiscal neutrality.
47. Industry's demand for refinements in measurement accuracy, and for rigorous product specifications embodied in public standards continues to grow in all OECD countries. The needs of
Brazilian industry are therefore likely to increase substantially as it tries to move towards technology and skill intensive products that demand precision, quality and traceability to international
standards. Also, in order to take advantage of the opportunities created by trade liberalization,
Brazilian industry would need to upgrade from low-quality products, which have limited growth
prospects, towards the production of higher value-added goods and services. This transition
would require a scaling up of their technology upgrading efforts. The Brazilian government has
embarked on an ambitious reform effort to create an environment conducive to increased and
better focused science and technology expenditures. Technology transfer controls, including restrictions to the importation of computer software have been virtually eliminated. A US$155 million Science and Technology Reform Support loan from the World Bank in November 1997 attempts to address technology upgrading among firms by encouraging research within the private
sector through matching grants. A provision for strengthening the metrology infrastructure as
well as assistance with IPR reform also exists within this project. Undoubtedly low investments
in R&D is a legacy of the high inflation era in Brazil when all long term investments were postponed. Even though price stabilization has taken place, the government deficit has prevented interest rates from coming down, making long term investments (particularly risky ones) non-viable
for most firms that cannot generate sufficient funds internally. Instruments that seek to address
the technological upgrading efforts of firms without posing additional burden on the public
budget will need to be explored.
Sharing the Benefits of Growth and Reform
48. The WBG's consultations with the private sector highlighted that the sharing of benefits of
the reform process is very much under discussion in Brazil today. The implementation of the Real
Plan, and the transformation of Brazil's economy since 1997, was made possible by a broad domestic consensus that previous economic models were a failure, and that only major reforms
could succeed. Through the course of the WBG's consultations with the private sector in Brazil,
there emerged concern that this consensus could unravel leading in the short-run to growing difficulties in implementing the remaining reform agenda, and in the longer term, a perceived risk of
policy reversals. Many see future problems if there are not enough investments now. The perceived risk is generally not seen as collapse, but as continued stagnation. In a country with high
expectations and significant poverty, this brings risk of policy reversals.
49. Brazil's social problem is in many ways an economic growth problem: there is a pressing
need for increased growth and increased distribution of the benefits of this growth. The reform
and economic adjustment process which Brazil has been going through has not immediately resolved this issue. On the one hand, first-generation reforms, particularly trade liberalization and
privatization of state-run enterprises, typically do not have positive short-term impacts on employment and wages, as excess labor (especially in state-run firms) is reduced, and as firms seek
to increase efficiency and productivity in the face of new global competitors. On the other hand,
second-generation reforms which are needed to lay the groundwork for sustained private sectorled growth take longer to put in place, slowing the absorptive capacity of new private sector
growth and firm creation. Large firms adjust and have a chance to be competitive but are rarely
the source of large new employment. Meanwhile, lack of credit for new and small or mid-size
firms means that the typical engines of employment creation are stalled.
50. Left unchecked, the negatively biased perception of the reform and adjustment process can
reduce the consensus for sound macroeconomic policies, and lead to reversals of the gains that

Box 10: IFC and IBRD Collaborationin Brazil: going forward

WB and IFC teams working on Brazil have agreed to focus on three main areas for joint work:
(i) water and sanitation; (ii) the financial sector; and (iii) SMEs. In the case of water, the Group
will seek to replicate its earlier success in other sub-sectors where IBRD-supported policy reforms were followed by successful IFC pioneering investments, providing a demonstration effect that the newly opened sub-sectors were viable for private investors. IBRD and IFC will also
work together on advising the govemment (at Federal and state levels) on moving forward on
concession designs. In the financial sector,joint work will focus on securities markets, particularly searching for ways to improve corporate govemance. IFC will collaborate here with IBRD
ESW work. Similarly on SMEs, IFC and IBRD expect to collaborate on ESW work, with some
focused specifically in the Northeast. IFC and IBRD are considering additional co-location of
staff in Ceara to facilitate this effort.
have been made through the reform process to date. An important remedy is the delivery of visible benefits to the population.
51. Some areas where these issues can be seen are in urban services, where the fast growth of
many urban areas has led to a persistent access gap for urban services for the poor. Basic physical
services for the poor, including access to affordable and secure housing, can significantly improve living conditions of the poor. Water and sanitation services and urban transport are typically among the highest priorities. About 20 million Brazilians lack safe drinking water and 40
million have inadequate sanitation services. These are two services where expansion of service is
closely connected to improving living standards and reducing poverty, and where weaknesses diproportionatelyaffect the poor. Only about 20% of collected sewage is treated. Meanwhile, contnued migration to Brazil's cities continues to raise the need for effective urban transport.In addition,
both sectors are large consumers of public subsidies, and effective concessioning programs could
have a major positive impact on public finances.
52. In the case of water, the debate over conceding authorities has been blocking significant progress in the sector for some time. Public sector investment has declined, and the performance of
state-run water companies in Brazil ranks among the worst in the world. Efforts to introduce significant levels of private participation have foundered on the question of whether state or municipal authorities should grant concessions in this sector. The question of the conceding authority
has importance related both to the division of revenues that would accrue upon the granting of the
concession, and the operation and eventual termination of the concession. A critical question,
which has impeded development of private participation in water in many countries, is that of
who would have responsibility for compensation to the private sector operator in the event of an
early termination of a concession. This question of putting the appropriate framework in place is
paramount for getting private investment into the sector so as to improve access, cost, and quality
of water and sanitation services.
53. Urban transport is an area with potential major impact on urban living standards. In contrast
to water, major efforts have been proceeding, although as in the case of water there is still limited
progress. The World Bank is currently assisting Brazil with nine projects in this area (one involving IFC advisory support), and it is expected that the first major concessions will begin to
materialize in the coming few years, delivering significant improvements in urban standards of
living. The concession for Rio de Janeiro has been awarded, and is now in the process of seeking
financing.
The World Bank Group's Assistance Strategy

54. The principal objective of the WBG's assistance strategy for Brazil is poverty reduction. The
achievement of sustainable, private-sector led, broadly shared growth is critical for Brazil to

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page XXVII

make substantial progress on poverty alleviation. The following three areas are major priorities
for achievement of such growth:
(a) Creation of new, formal employment opportunities in internationally competitive private
firms.
(b) Broadened finance access to the commercial system, both for starting businesses (i.e. bank
lending, leasing, microfinance), and for participation in their benefits (i.e. broader share ownership).
(c) Delivery of improvements in areas of basic needs and/or visible impact on standards of living: housing, water, health, education, urban transport.
55. There are a number of constraints confronting the private sector in leading such growth. The
main constraints, as discussed in the preceding sections are: (a) access to capital; (b) remaining
barriers to competitiveness in transport costs; and (c) resolution of the concessioning authority
debate in the water sector.
56. The following section outlines the WBG's strategy for supporting Brazil in achieving these
objectives, and for addressing the principal constraints.
IBRD
57. Summary. IBRD's role in supporting private sector-led growth in Brazil is aligned with the
preceding diagnosis. It is aimed principally at supporting the Government's efforts to deepen fiscal reform. The latter, given the fiscal deficit and its effect on the cost of capital, is probably the
most critical area for improving Brazil's growth prospects. In addition, the Bank's activities are
expected to support private sector development priorities in infrastructure and the financial sector.
58. Infrastructure. While infrastructure investments are of critical importance to Brazil's development, the overall financing needs are very large compared to the Bank's total lending volume.
The Bank's contribution, therefore, has to be highly strategic. In infrastructure, the Bank will focus on lending for reforms aimed at: (i) increasing private sector participation; (ii) providing
services to the poor; or (iii) reducing fiscal drain from the sectors. The sectoral mix will continue
to evolve away from those sub-sectors where reforms have been implemented (telecommunications, power, ports, rail, roads) to more complex sub-sectors where reform is less advanced, notably water, urban transport, and multimodal transport.
59. Privatization of the water and sanitation sector provides an opportunity for improved services
while reducing the fiscal drain. The Bank is supporting this program through lending and nonlending services, the latter focused in particular on the creation of effective regulatory mechanisms. Bank assistance will continue to be provided in three main areas: (i) institutional and
regulatory reform; (ii) service extension to the poor; and (iii) water quality, pollution control and
urban drainage. For the institutional and regulatory reform, the guiding principles of the Bank
assistance strategy are to: (i) promote further sector institutional reform, including private sector
participation to introduce competition; (ii) reshape the Federal Government role by strengthening
its capacity for policy formulation, information management, and promoting training and research; (iii) develop sector regulatory frameworks which promote efficiency, ensure quality of
service, and protect consumers; (iv) establish financially and politically independent regulatory
agencies and training of the regulators; (v) foster private sector financing of water and sewerage
infrastructures; and (vi) develop a better targeted public financing strategy for poverty and environment investments.
60. Efficient urban transport as well as water and sanitation services contribute to the growth of
cities and improve the quality of life, in many cases in particular those of the poorer residents.
IBRD has an active program supporting urban transport programs in a number of cities throughout Brazil. In Sao Paulo, use of the private sector through a BOT mechanism for expansion of

Page XXVIII

metro lines is being piloted, and IFC's advisory services unit is working with Bank staff on implementation. In Rio de Janeiro, IBRD has been supporting the award of the first urban transport
concession, and IFC is presently considering financial support to the winning consortia's investment plans.
61. Multimodal transport is considered to be the next frontier for reducing transport costs for
Brazilian producers. Substantial gains are expected from optimizing the transport mix in many
areas. IBRD is planning a possible US$100m multimodal transport loan in this area, while IFC
expects to consider investments in the sub-sector.
62. Financial Sector. In the financial sector, the Bank is increasing its non-lending services. The
emerging focus lies on: (i) identifying and overcoming obstacles to financial intermediation and
access to capital for the private sector; and (ii) banking supervision and issues related to the
banking sector safety net. An existing loan is providing the Central Bank of Brazil with technical
skills support, particularly on the latter priority. Short policy notes are being .developed in areas
such as impediments to financial intermediation, capital markets and public debt management,
agricultural finance, and bank safety net.
63. IBRD is engaged,jointly with IFC, on Technical Assistance in the area ofCorporate Govemance. Current efforts focus on issues of minority shareholders (particularly related to non-voting
shares). Other regulations related to adequate disclosure of information, transparency, and independent oversight may also need to be examined. We expect this work to take the form of formal
ESW in FY2000. This will add to ongoing work on development and expansion of a Credit Registry supported by IBRD. In SMEs and microfinance, IBRD is completing ESW. The Bank has
also provided Technical Assistance to Banco do Nordeste for its microlending program. Further
joint work in this area between IFC and IBRD is expected. Finally, ESW is planned currently for
FY2001-2002 in the area of land and housing markets. This would open an additional area for
collaboration between the Bank and IFC.
64. Other. In the areas of higher education, skill and technology development, the Bank is already active through an ongoing science and technology project. Future Bank assistance could
include non-lending services regarding intemational experience with the implications of information and other new technologies on public sector management and policies in Brazil. Another area
of assistance is the reform of higher education, possibly through an APL in support of a student
loan system that would allow existing public resources to be focused on the expansion of higher
education and their accessibility for a broader segment of the Brazilian population. The IFC is
undertaking complementary investments in higher and/or technical education.
65. A detailed review of the innovation framework could provide the foundation for an integrated
strategy on science and technology for Brazil. In particular, greater coordination between the
technology projects and higher education programs supported by the WBG could be a positive
outcome of such an integrated review. The Bank plans to support such efforts through further
ESW.
66. The Bank is supporting an initiative in the Northeast to develop, in public-private partnership.
business clusters Early results of this work are presently being assessed. Uneven regional development is a serious issue in Brazil. Despite a distinguished economic, cultural, and political heritage, the Northeast has struggled in recent decades to adapt to increasing competition and develop
new industries. The Bank-supported Pro-NortheastInitiative is a private sector focused economic
development effort designed to increase the competitive performance of the region. It is different
from the strategies that have been used in Brazil in the past in that it avoids large public investments and tax subsidies. Instead it focuses on mobilizing the private sector with the aim of amplifying the voice of the private sector in articulating its needs and stimulating the development and
execution of proactive initiatives that are led by the private sector. Constraints and challenges
have been identified across several economic activities and momentum has been gathered in fos-

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

tering collective action on the part of concerned sections of the private sector. While some constraints can be addressed via collective action among the private sector itself, others may require a
facilitative role to be played by public funds by incorporating the priorities of each economic activity in the management and direction of public expenditures that would be undertaken anyway.
The Bank may play a useful role in this context where the private sector has been actively engaged in analysis and is just beginning a process of communication with the public sector. Further, the demonstration effect of such initiatives is usually very large. These pilots could be used
to demonstrate the potential that underlies a participative approach to other states or regions. Encouraging cross fertilization of ideas and sharing of tools and lessons across regions could energize similar initiatives to be piloted in other clusters and parts of Brazil.
IFC
67. IFC's strategy, consistent with the CAS framework and priorities for private sector development in Brazil, will have three primary components: (i) backing companies that will create
growth; (ii) supporting activity which demonstrates tangible benefits of liberalization; (iii) investing in financial and physical infrastructureto improve the prospects for sustained growth. IFC
expects that its investments, following this strategy, will continue to be constrained primarily by
the Corporation's single-country exposure guidelines (see Box below), and will total approximately US$0.8-1.0 billion for IFC's account over the 2000-2002 period. In view of continuing
instability in external financial markets, it is anticipated that mobilization of syndicated loans
through IFC's loan "B" program will also be lower than the previous three-year period, at between US$0.5 and US$1.0 billion (see Figure 11 for the evolution of B loan volume over the preceding CAS period).

68. Based on these considerations, IFC currently projects that its gross investments in Brazil will
total US$1.2-$1.8 billion over the period (see Table 20). While this is far short of any conceivable
level of shortfall in demand for capital that Brazil's private sector will experience, the Corporation believes that-strategically applied-it will enable IFC and its shareholders to have a significant impact in support of Brazil over the coming three years.

69. Backing companies that will create growth. As stated in the CAS, labor-intensive growth
requires first and foremost capital access for mid-size companies. In the current phase of consolidation, Brazil's blue chip companies are restructuring and modernizing, but generally shedding

rather than adding employment. It is unclear at present whether small firms in Brazil, clearly the
largest source of employment, are creating new net employment, and how much of this is formal
rather than informal employment. Thus middle market companies, relying on the recent implementation of structural reforms which have opened the economy, can be expected to be the main
source of new, net, formal employment opportunities in Brazil.
70. As indicated in Table 21, supporting middle market companies has been a successful element
of IFC's country strategy over the previous three-year period. It is also an area where project
processing is less resource-intensive than for more complex infrastructure transactions, and where
benefits from project implementation can be expected to materialize and become visible within a
12 month timeframe, rather than 3-5 years as can be the case for more complex transactions with
longer implementation horizons.

71. Backing the types of companies that are the likeliest to produce growth is an important way
IFC can support the economic reform process in Brazil. This means supporting primarily mid-size

72. In order to support this focus of IFC's activity, IFC has strengthened substantially its local
resources in Brazil. This has included the relocation of IFC's Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean from Washington to Brazil late in FY99.

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page XXXI

73. This focus also implies that IFC will do less of certain other types of investments. In particular, natural resource and petrochemical sectors, which accounted for a large part of IFC's earlier
investment (measured by volume), will play a much more limited role going forward.
74. Supporting activity which demonstrates tangible benefits of liberalization. The second

main plank of IFC's strategy in Brazil will be to support activity which demonstrates tangible and
broadly distributed benefits from liberalization. Successful private provision of key services, especially in areas in which private activity was previously precluded, could help maintain the consensus that continued economic reform represents the path that will bring the most benefits to
Brazilians. Specifically, IFC will seek to support projects which deliver: clean water, health care,
education, housing finance and urban transport.
75. We expect this list to evolve as further work is done to ascertain where private investment
can be expected to have the most impact. These are relatively new areas for IFC, where the Corporation is learning the best way to support private sector efforts. IFC's investments in the provision of private health care delivery and private education in Brazil complement the Bank's strategy directed at improved poverty focusing of public health care and education, and will be fully
consistent with the strategy papers presented to the Board of Directors for these two sectors39
These are also difficult and complex areas. Water needs resolution of the concessioning authority
debate. Housing finance is unlikely to develop until interest rates fall.
76. IFC will also continue to make special efforts to support the private sector in theNortheast
states. Given the higher levels of poverty in this part of Brazil, the incremental impact of growth
in these states on poverty reduction is higher than on the average for Brazil. IFC has invested
US$129 million in the Northeast over the previous CAS period, primarily in agribusiness, manufacturing and services (see Table 22). In addition, IFC has undertaken a number of advisory assignments in the Northeast. The Corporation's new office in Ceara is supporting this facet of
TFC's strategy.

77. Financial Sector. Lack of intermediation to the private sector is a central problem today in
Brazil (see paragraphs 14 ff.). However, while IFC has recognized expertise in developing financial and capital markets, scope for effective IFC support in this area in Brazil is limited. IFC
made four investments in this area in the previous CAS period, for a total of US$110 million. The
problem lies primarily in the level of interest rates, rather than in the supply of funds, and there
are major players engaged in most activities, with limited need for IFC technical support save for
a few specialized areas. This is reflected in the lower share of financial sector investments by IFC
in the previous CAS period (4.0%, vs. 35% worldwide). IFC activity could nonetheless play a
role in helping develop some specialized segments, such as microlending, or in improving conditions in the domestic equity markets. In this respect, IFC Technical Assistance is underway to
seek ways to improve some governance aspects of capital markets activity. In addition, the current inability of Brazilian banks to access term foreign exchange funds through the bond market
may lead to demand for IFC lines for on-lending.
78. Housing finance is an area where IFC expects to have an impact in the later part of this CAS
period. There is a huge informal investment going into this sector, and it is the main asset in
which people invest savings. IFC approved an investment in this area earlier; however, the spon39

sors have not proceeded with the proposed investment due to the very high interest-rate environment prevailing in Brazil.
79. Infrastructure. Infrastructure has, as noted, accounted for a large share of IFC activity in
Brazil during the previous CAS period, with approvals of just under US$1 billion. These investments covered a wide range of subsectors, including power generation, ports, railroads, telecommunications, and roads. This is expected to decline substantially in the 2000-2002 period. Although the demand for financing in this area remains very high, IFC's role is declining in certain
aspects. This shift reflects: (i) the increasing size and financial capacity of many of the sponsors
who have become involved through the privatization program, (ii) the fact that IFC is no longer
needed for pilot demonstration transactions in many sectors where private participation has become well-established, and (iii) IFC's limited country headroom compared with the very large
size of most individual investment programs. Nonetheless, there will still be some important IFC
activity in infrastructure, albeit concentrated in less-developedareas and in new sub-sectors:
(a) Water, where much work remains to be done on the regulatory framework, where risk perceptions remain high, and where average transaction sizes are lower.
(b) Urban transport, pushing forward from the work the World Bank has been doing in designing
concession frameworks, and where risk perceptions also remain high.
(c) Intermodal transport and logistics, where project complexities may call for IFC's financial
engineering skills.
80. IFC will seek in these areas, as it previously has in other sub-sectors, to provide a demonstration effect through the financing of pioneering transactions. In addition, advisory services have
played an important part in IFC's support for infrastructure development. Recent advisory assignments include electricity generation and distribution in the Northeast, and in water for Sao
Paulo. IFC is presently providing such advice to the State of Ceara, in the water and port sectors,
and on the Sao Paulo metro system.
81. Systemic support. In addition, and in spite of the existing country exposure constraint, IFC
will maintain its readiness to assist the Government of Brazil and the private sector in the design
and implementation of wholesale credit enhancement vehicles, in the event of continued deterioration in the international financial markets. IFC and IBRD designed one such vehicle (which
included a partial WB guarantee) at the time of the devaluation of Brazil's currency, which was
well received by market participants and ratings agencies. However, improved market conditions
in March and April 1999 led the Government to decide against the implementation of such a vehicle at that time.
MIGA
82. As of December 31, 1999 Brazil is the largest host country for MIGA insured investments
accounting for 13% of MIGA's total gross exposure. MIGA's outstanding portfolio in Brazil consists of 25 contracts of guarantee for a total gross exposure of US$585 million (US$189 million in
the financial sector, US$175 million in infrastructure, US$58 million in manufacturing, US$15
million in oil and gas, and US$150 million in services), of which MIGA's net exposure amounts
to US$271 million. To date, the total of amount of foreign direct investment facilitated by MIGA
is above US$3 billion.
83. FY99 was a record year for MIGA in Brazil. MIGA issued 7 contracts of guarantee for a total
gross exposure of US$177 million, and a cumulative project cost of US$1.8 billion. This included
the first time use of MIGA's Cooperative Underwriting and Facultative Reinsurance Program in
Brazil, enabling it to respond to an increasing demand given its own internal capacity constraints.
84. For FY00 MIGA faces a severe capacity constraint given the increasing demand by foreign
investors. As of December 31, 1999, registered investments are in excess of US$15 billion.

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

Page XXXIII

MIGA will be extremely selective in allocating its remaining capacity. It will leverage its capacity by using its syndication program through the use of reinsurance and/or coinsurance agreements with private insurers, and multilateral and bilateral institutions..
85. MIGA's overall objectives in Brazil are to diversify its portfolio in accordance with the CAS
objectives, notably in water and sanitation, manufacturing, services, agroindustries, and projects
supporting the development of SME's. Highly developmental projects in other sectors will also be
considered, as well as projects which will help alleviate Brazil's current account deficit. In addition to issuing guarantees for foreign investments in Brazil, MIGA will seek to issue guarantees
for Brazilian investments in other developing countries.

Annex 6: Thematic Summary of Comments Received during the CAS
Consultation Process
1. In agreement with the Brazilian Government, the Brazil CMU undertook selective consultations for the preparation of this CAS with members of Congress, several Ministers, the Governors
and State Secretaries of seven states (Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Ceara, Pernambuco, Parana, Sao
Paulo, and Mato Grosso), the management of BNDES, academics, civil society representatives,
union representatives, and leaders of the Catholic Church (CNBB). These meetings took place
from October to December 1999. The consultations included about 20 meetings with a total of
about 70 individuals. In addition, during the preparation of the Private Sector Strategy of the
CAS, IFCand Bank staff consulted with representatives of the private sector, the financial sector,
and industrial associations.
This Annex presents a thematic summary of the comments received during the CAS consultation
meetings, which have complemented the ongoing process of Bank staff discussions and consultations with a large number of individuals inside and outside of Government. These broader consultative discussions over time have intensified over the last two years as the result of the CMU
decentralization to Brasilia and have equally contributed to the views expressed in this CAS.
The specific CAS consultations and the broader consultative discussions are part of the ongoing
attempt of the Bank to better understand the complex transformations taking place in Brazil at the
current time and, together with the Government, use this understanding to adapt the Bank's assistance strategy in the most productive way. Consultative discussions and the related learning process will continue and will be reflected in future CAS updates and the next CAS.
The reproduction of the comments received does not imply an endorsement by the World Bank of
any views expressed. Moreover, the selection of individuals that the Bank was able to met was
influenced by a variety of factors and was not meant to be representative of Brazilian society.
Therefore, the comments should not be misunderstood as a comprehensive or official representation of groups or views present in Brazil. Obviously, many other prominent views are being expressed in Brazil but have not found their way into these particular CAS consultations and are
therefore not reflected in this note.
The consultation process has created a rich context for the discussion of a country assistance
strategy for Brazil. In many cases, the consultation process has confirmed views held by the
Bank. In other cases, the process has alerted the Bank to issues that are perceived as important but
were not before sufficiently contemplated by the Bank. In some cases-including issues related to
housing, the relations between growth, poverty and inequality, and judicial sector reforms-the
Bank has, in agreement with Government, adjusted the proposed work program in particular with
respect to the list of proposed non-lending services. These adjustments are reflected in the present
CAS document.
Overall Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy

* Brazilian society accepts the stabilization efforts, but the problem is that there is been no significant growth for too long. (State NE)
* Job creation is essential for poverty reduction. Need to have a program to direct dismissed
workers to other jobs. (State S/SE)
* Return of growth is critical for employment, but structure of growth also matters. Tri-partite
sectoral chambers and industrial policies necessary to stimulate growth. Better education
alone will not generate growth. (Unions)

At the same time, there is a sense that the poverty reduction effect of growth is insufficient
and needs to be complemented by targeted policies to address inequality directly.
*

Growth alone will not resolve poverty. To improve social spending, capacity building to prepare local leaders to identify and manage social programs is critical. (State NE)
* Unfortunately, growth has only a small impact on poverty reduction. (State NE)
* Unemployment is the critical issue in the Southeast; despite massive private investment, little
employment has been generated. A new growth model is required. (State S/SE)
* Since growth alone is insufficient for poverty reduction, the Bank should more explicitly address inequality. (NGOs)
* While economic growth is essential for poverty alleviation, it is not enough to tackle high
levels of inequality as experienced in Brazil. It is not clear what the Bank's strategy is to reduce economic and social inequality. (NGOs)
* Bank needs to focus on inequality in Brazil. The example of Chile demonstrates that it is not
enough to simply combat poverty through economic growth, since the levels of inequality can
even worsen in some cases. For this reason, addressing social and regional inequality should
be a priority in public policy. (NGOs)
* The failure to spread the benefits of growth is going to threaten the growth itself. Brazil could
enter a "social crisis," in which crime, security, and general unrest would threaten the reforms
already made. (Private Sector)
• Growth has been through large companies,and the benefits have therefore not been felt by
the poor. (Industrial Association, Financial Sector)
Overall, Brazil accepts globalization as a reality and wants to get the most benefits out of it.
At the same time, costs and downside risks of globalization, especially on the social side,
need to be carefully managed.
*

Globalization is here to stay. Self-protection of emerging economies like Brazil require a
strong foreign reserve policy and good liquidity. In the face of globalization, Brazil's main
vulnerability is its high dependence on external savings. (Academic)
* Brazil needs private external and internal capital, but there should be rules against speculative
capital. (State S/SE)
* Some control of international capital is critical to reduce vulnerability of Brazil to external
shocks. (NGOs)
* Globalization presents risks. Social investment is the most important safeguard against potential risks. (State S/SE)

Page XXXVI

But not everyone agrees that globalization is good or unavoidable.
*
*

There is no evidence that external capital is contributing to growth and development (Congress)
Negative aspects of globalization include increased social segregation, the poor become
poorer; speed of information is not good for emerging economies. (Congress)

The PPA is welcomed as an important approach by Government, but more participation in
the development of Government strategies is desired.
*

The Government approach seems simplistic, as though reforms will automatically lead to
more stability and prosperity. The social security reform could have been discussed more
with society. Tax reform is quite important and should be prioritized over the others (the elite
does not pay taxes, the workers do). Judicial reform is not as important as the other two.
(Unions)
* The Bank diagnosis is based on the Government's program (PPA), yet the Government could
have had broader discussions and consultations before launching the PPA. The PPA is excessively optimistic in terms of the growth and deficit reduction rates projected. The Bank
should adopt a more cautious view regarding these projections. (NGOs)
* The Government should go further in consulting Congress and civil society in the definition
of its policies. (Congress)
Growth Policies

Need to have an industrial policy to createjobs. (State NE)
More attention to job creation, less attention to exports ("why should a country (market) of
160 million be concerned about exporting?"). (State S/SE)
Growth is crucial for Northeastern states; Federal Government must come up with a policy
for growth.
National enterprises often fail to perceive economic opportunities. Here IFC can help. (State
S/SE)
For Brazilian industry to become more competitive lower taxes and lower interest rates are
critical. (State S/SE)
Current tax system is really bad and depresses growth. (Academic)
Complicated tax system reduces investment. (Industrial Associations)
CPMF (financial transactions tax) is a big problem for exporters. (Private Sector)
Finance is the main obstacle to investment and growth. (Private Sector, Financial Sector)
Intermodal transport should be an important focus for Government intervention. (Private
Sector, Industrial Associations)
The transposition of water from the Rio Sao Francisco is critical for the development of the
Northeast.
The Bank should give more emphasis to high technology training (Science and Technology).
(Congress)
State tax reductions for microenterprises have led to the formalization of microenterprises,
compensated for the revenue loss and increased employment. (State NE)
Government should focus attention on agribusiness as a growth opportunity: intensive in less
educated labor, Brazil has comparative advantage. (Private Sector)

Laws surrounding minority shareholdingmake equity finance almost impossible. (Financial
Sector)

Especially in the Northeast, there are many voices for more proactive regional development
policies.
*
*
*
*

Regional policies and the reduction of regional inequality are key to reduce inequality and
poverty. Effective regional desconcentration and industrial policy could change the regional
differences greatly within five years. But major national effort would be required. (State NE)
Fiscal war between states is result of lack of other means to attract investments, as 60% of
fiscal incentives go to the South. (State NE)
Important to work on regional inequality within Brazil but also look at specific disadvantaged
areas such as the southern half of Rio Grande do Sul. (Minister)
Public funding for regional development should go more into infrastructure rather than private enterprises. (Minister)

Targeted Poverty Reduction
Within targeted policies for poverty reduction,there are different priorities; but there is
broad agreement that the focus should be on policies that generate sustainable income for
the poor, with a primary focus on educationand land reform.
*
*
*

*

*
*
*
*
*
*

Main issues relating to poverty are hunger, housing, education, health, abandoned children,
crime,jobs. (Congress)
Importance of work of joint congressional committee on poverty. (Congress)
There are three parallel approaches to combat poverty: (a) incentives for small and mediumsized enterprises, which would create jobs, (b) tax reform (reducing tax rates, increasing coverage and reducing evasion)) and export incentives to increase production, employment and
thus reduce poverty, (c) "assistencialismo", e.g., negative income tax, and workfare. (Congress)
Poverty reduction needs a two-track approach: (a) income distribution through increased
taxes from increased growth and provision of social services; (b) short-term compensatory
policies, less bureaucratic and more effective interventions, better targeting of resources,
partnerships with civil society, capacity-building.Better compensatorypolicies does not only
mean "cesta basica", "renda minima", but rather programs like "bolsa-escola" to combat
child labor or qualification programs. (State NE)
The Bank's poverty alleviation strategy needs to take into account regional differences. (NE
is different from the SE). They should also avoid incorporating dependency-generating activities such as food distribution mechanisms. (NGOs)
Most important elements for social inclusion are education and land reform. (Congress)
Transference of assets to the poor is a must; key programs include "bolsa-escola", "renda
minima", and low income housing. (Congress)
The priorities for poverty reduction are education, water resource development, and urbanization of small cities and creation of rural non-farm employment. (State NE)
Most important investments are land reform in rural areas and housing in urban areas.
(NGOs)
Brazil is too big, and Bank has impact only if it concentrates rather than scatters its resources.
Bank should focus on a few tangible programs that expand the realm of equality, i.e. universal access to water and sanitation; including programs to help privatize water and sanitation
companies, including funding of severance pay and other incentives for states to move ahead.
(Academic)

The Northeast gets unfair "preferential treatment". Poverty is also an issue in the South, but
Bank is focusing too much on the Northeast. (State S/SE)

There is widespread concern about the quality and targeting of social spending.
*

Need more focus on social issues and better use of resources for poverty reduction efforts.
(Congress)
* Even though the quality of current social spending is poor, more needs to be done to address
misery. (Congress)
* There is concern with the degree of fragmentationof Govemment social action. The Government should move from a series of social programs to an overall coherent social development strategy. Vocational training programs are too limited and mechanically focused on
geographic areas resulting in less than optimal social impact. (NGOs)
* Social security reform will hurt philanthropic organizations that help the poor; danger that
rural pension are being cut. (Church)
But social spending in Brazil-excluding social security-is not considered excessively high.
*
*

Social expenditures in Brazil are not high if social security is excluded. (Church)
Stating the size of the Government's social expenditures is not sufficient, since one needs to
differentiate between allocation (dota,co) and actual expenditures (gastos). Actual social expenditures are not high in Brazil. Approving the budget but not disbursing the funds in a
timely fashion is an approach used to fight the deficit. (NGOs)
* It is misleading to say that social expenditures in Brazil are high. The cited 20% of GNP include pensions, labor costs, and other direct administrative costs, which should not be
counted as direct social program costs. Further, fragility of social services are not only due to
lack of will, competence, or poor execution, but also to the lack of resources. (Unions)
• Concern with the Bank's economic adjustment loan since the social protection component
was used to cover the deficit rather than going to poverty alleviation programs directly. Fiscal
adjustment measures need to maintain a minimum level of social protection, especially in the
area of employment generation and housing, in order to avoid sparking an increase in the levels of poverty. (NGOs)
Education continues to be top priority for poverty reduction;however, concerns need now
include early childhood and secondary education, which is an emerging bottleneck.
* Important to create educational opportunities for the poor, especially street children. (Church)
* National policies on education should be more targeted to the Northeast. FUNDEF works
with the same rules in all regions of the country. (State NE)
* Basic education is important but there should also be focus on programs for children 0-7
years-old. (Congress)
* For education, efforts have shifted to the completion of secondary education. (State S/SE)
* State is very concerned with secondary education as an emerging bottleneck where the responsibility falls totally on the state. (State NE)
* The basic education approach should be complemented with financing for secondary education and professional training, which are the emerging bottlenecks for higher technological
development. (Unions)
* Would be important to interest private sector in (higher) education and have IFC participation
in the sector. More investment in programs for children between 0 and 7 years of age are
needed. Bypassing the state government and funding education directly at the municipal or

Brazil: Country Assistance Strategy

school level creates accountability and transparency problems and undermines financial controls. (State S/SE)
Low income housing and related urban upgrading is seen as a key social policy not receiving sufficient weight in the Bank's program.
* Brazil needs more active housing policy. (State S/SE)
* First item in the social agenda should be housing for the poor. The Bank should help in this
area (especially in the financial aspects of housing programs). (Church)
* Housing is an important problem area; however difficult to address when it involves resettlement. Because of resettlement problems, projects focus often more narrowly on single services like sanitation services. (State NE)
* Housing is the main place where people put their savings, and housing finance is therefore
important for encouraging growth. (Financial Sector)
* Mass transport and housing are the main urban problems. (State S/SE)
Rural development and poverty reduction are consideredof great importance and critical
for reducing excessive migration. Periodic droughts remain a major unresolved issue for the
rural Northeast.
*

*
*
*

*
*

Mercosul has hurt agriculture in the South. There should be more credit available for farmers

in the region. (Church)
Need for an agricultural policy that addresses at the needs of small farmers and is based on
the "agricultural vocation" of every region in the country, and expanded land reform.
(Church)
Improved technologies for development in the semi-arid area critical; Caatinga needs to be
preserved since otherwise desertification;however local development hindered by lack of
entrepreneurial culture in the interior; education is critical to change this. (State NE)
The cost of keeping population in rural areas is small but the cost of excessive migration to
cities is high. Housing is a critical issue; however with accelerating migration, Government
cannot provide jobs and housing for all. Therefore, strong focus on rural small towns required. Programs to control rural exodus are critical. Examples of programs that provide rural
workers with land, housing and infrastructure.(State S/SE)
Rural electrification is a major remaining challenge. (State NE)
Due to the reduced importance of agriculture, droughts have now less of an economic impact
but still a major social impact; there is a need for social programs that allow for faster and
more sustainable response to droughts; otherwise it will not be possible to keep populations
in rural areas. Non-farm employment options are critical for rural poverty reduction. (State
NE)

There is strong support for land reform and some questions about the Bank-financed pilot
project for market-assisted land reform.
* Land reform needs to move faster. Process is too slow. State is creating its own program to
consolidate existing settlements. (State NE)
* Accelerated land reform is urgent to keep social peace. (State S/SE)
* Market-based agrarian reform can lead to land speculation and overpaying of large landowners. Further it may lead to indebtedness of the small-scale farmers it is intending to benefit.
(Unions)

Especially in the large urban centers, violence is viewed as a major issue for quality of life,
poverty reduction and growth.

*
*

Public security is a key concern in urban areas that requires more action. (NGOs)
Violence and public safety is a major issue: inequality, TV and drugs produce violence. (State
S/SE)

Race, ethnicity and gender are important dimensions of development that need to be considered.

*

In Brazil, race, ethnicity, and gender are key developmentfactors that need to be taken more
seriously. (NGOs)
* The Bank should invest more heavily in the indigenous area, financing bilingual and bicultural education. Government does not invest enough in indigenous peoples' education. There
are very little resources for land demarcation since most of the available Government resources come from external resources such as Pilot Program to Conserve the Amazon. Lack
of attention to demarcation results in incentives for invasion of indigenous lands. It would be
important for the indigenous communities to have direct access to Government resources.
(NGOs)
Many concerns are raised about the high level of informality in the labor markets.

*

The Bank and the Government need to demonstratemore concern with the exceedingly high
level of the informal sector in the Brazilian economy. It even seems as though informality
was encouraged as a way of keeping wages in the formal sector down and forcing the flexibility of labor codes. The problem is the informal sector not only leads to loss of hard-earned
workers rights, but also does not generate taxes or growth. (Unions)
* Some of the discussion of the "Custo Brasir' and labor costs is misleading. Analysis demonstrates that the labor markets in Brazil are not as rigid as stated. Further, the argument mixes
universal labor rights, such as vacation and weekly rest, with direct labor costs. (Unions)

Many comments refer to specific programs and concerns on targeted social programs.

*

The issue of making micro-credit accessible for the poor is central to growth. But the Brazilian experience, through the use of FAT resources, is not as positive as it tends to provide
credit for those who already are economicallyestablished, rather than targeting the program
to the poorer producers.
* Funding for the 2000 population census may be in danger. But this is a critical activity for
social policy. (Minister)
a
Brazil already has several effective minimum income programs. These should be jointly and
systematically evaluated. (Minister)
* Workfare programs have problems finding sufficient uptake even where more than one
minimum salary is offered. (State S/SE)
* Changes in the health care system toward prevention are critical and underway. Changes toward family health will move the system toward prevention. (Minister)
* The decentralization of health care to municipalities has been costly and premature. Training
and supervision of lower government levels is critical. (Minister)
* Earmarking budget funds may be absurd but it is absolutely necessary to ensure stable funding of this critical sector. (Minister)

Fiscal Adjustment and Reforms
A sentiment of critical importance of completing the ongoing reforms is widely shared
*
*

High cost of finance is due to public financing needs (Financial Sector)
Major reforms have been completed, but key Constitutional reforms need to be completed
(administrative, social security) (Congress)
* Reforms should be completed Election cycle is obstacle to reforms (Congress)
* Brazil is close to an economic breakthrough that will happen once the reforms are completed
and interest rates come down Without the completion of reforms, nothing will happen,
though (Minister)
* Federal and state fiscal adjustment is fundamental Without administrative and Government
pension reform, nothing will be resolved (State S/SE, Private Sector, Financial Sector)
But some disagree with the weight put on fiscal adjustment.
*

*

Bank takes similar position to that of Govemment on the relation between stability and fiscal
adjustment In 1995 there was no fiscal deficit The deficit grew due to the need to attract foreign capital The basic problem is that Brazil lacks a clear development model and thus it
leaves itself vulnerable to foreign economic trends and is stuck in a perennial adjustment
model (Unions)
Price increases will require salary increases, especially for teachers and police, however no
danger that of relapse into inflation (State NE)

There Is also widespread recognition that public pensions are at the core of fiscal adjustment efforts.
*
*
*

Without resolving the state pension issue, there will be no basis for fiscal equilibrium and
growth (State S/SE)
Some state social security funds are capitalized with questionable assets thus putting doubt on
their viability It would be important to encourage local models of successful social security
funds (Academic)
Effective social security reform requires a sufficiently large alliance of people who are
alarmed and threatened by insecure pensions, partial reforms may undermine the formation of
such alliances (Academic)

But there is also wide-ranging concern about the quality of fiscal adjustment
*

It is critical to differentiate between fiscal adjustment that hinders development and that
which does not (State NE)
* States need to invest, but current rules of fiscal adjustment do not allow the use of privatization receipts for investment even though not all investments translate into additional current
expenditures (State NE)
* Fiscal adjustment is necessary but, at the same time, it is necessary to maintain investments in
certain areas Unfortunately, all doors to financing are now closed Effectively, fiscal adjustment has shut down the State (State S/SE)
* Fiscal adjustment eliminates social investments in sanitation even where state companies are
profitable Under the current rules, social investments are considered sins (State S/SE)
* State achieved fiscal adjustment by cutting spending not by expanding revenues, however,
old debts are exploding in the hands of the State Govemment (State S/SE)
* Even profitable public enterprises cannot invest because of fiscal adjustment (State S/SE)

Page XLII
*

Brazil Country Assistance Strategy

The debt concept of the IMF agreement should be changed to put more weight on the quality
of adjustment (Minister)

*
*

The quality of fiscal adjustment is low, the fiscal effort is thus not sustainable and not credible (Academic)
It is questionable for the Bank to place as much emphasis on fiscal adjustment as it does The
problem is the speed and quality of the Government's fiscal adjustment approach Throughout this process there is not enough emphasis on the need to protect social expenditures and
undertake direct poverty alleviation measures Fiscal adjustment has caused unemployment,
which is a key mechanism of exclusion and increased poverty While no one disputes the
need for economic stability and structural reforms, pro-growth development strategies, which
are geared to creating jobs, are better in the long run (Unions)

Many states complain that the current rules of fiscal adjustment do not reward the reformers and thus undermine the incentives for sustainable state fiscal adjustment
*

The state has done its fiscal adjustment and has gained nothing in return States spending less
with personnel should be compensated by allowing higher indebtedness, treatment should be
different, instead, all states are treated the same way There are no real incentives for doing
things right The Government is fiscally too strict with well-performing states (State NE)
* Through fiscal adjustment, even fiscally sound states are paying for the mistakes of the national exchange rate and interest rate policies The equal treatment of states, regardless of
their economic level and their fiscal performance, undermines incentives for good performance The state fiscal problem was created by a small number of wealthier states who should
pay the price (State NE)
* Even the best performing states have fiscal problems Bank lending to states could be made
contingent on commercial credit rating of the state superior to the rating of the country (Academic)

There are interesting suggestions for further fiscal adjustment
*

*
*

Showcases of good government maybe easier to find and reward at the municipal level,
where there is more diversity and more ability to differentiate politically Municipalities don't
have the debt overhang of the states and are politically easier to control At municipal level, it
maybe possible to have a strict no bail-out policy (Academic)
Need for a tax reform that makes the rich pay their fair part (Church)
Bank could support and finance an effective implementation and enforcement system for the
Fiscal Responsibility Law (Academic)

There are many concerns about the privatization program, especially with respect to effective regulation of privatized services.
*

In several cases, even two years of privatization,there has been no effective regulation of the
privatized companies resulting in excessive increases in public utility tariffs (NGOs)
* Better regulation of privatized public companies is important (Congress)
* Training of regulators is critical (Academic)
* Concessions with length determined by demand/revenuescould help overcome demand estimate problem of current concessions in roads (Academic)
* Privatization has been patchy energy and communicationsgood but transport still very unreliable after privatization (Financial Sector)
* Concerns with the use of privatization proceeds (Church)

Previous administrative reforms at the state level have not worked, companies have been privatized but workers have remained with the state, dismissed workers have returned onto the
state payrolls (State S/SE)

Government Effectiveness
There is wide concern with the capacity of municipalitiesto take on responsibilities decentralized to them
*

*

Decentralization is irreversible But municipalities are often not ready to handle responsibilities from decentralization, need to strengthen local administrations State stopped formation
of new municipalities in 1991 already (State NE)
Capacity building for municipalities and training for mayors would be important (State S/SE)

Reform of the Judiciary is seen by many as a major issue.
*
*

*

•
-

Judicial reform is complicated but absolutely necessary, Judicial is often not aware of its responsibilities, corruption in the Judicial is a serious problem, changes have begun with the
work of congressional committee on the judiciary (Congress)
Corporativismoin the Judicial and need for judicial reform are major issues (State NE)
The Judiciary's interference in Government actions is reason for concern and makes administrative reform nearly impossible It is importantto distinguish between judicial strengthening (which is a less important issue) and genuinejudicial reform There is significant corruption in the judiciary
Judicial reform is important to make the judicial system more efficient, although there are
good examples in Brazil, for example the small claims courts (Congress)
Enforcement of security (collateral) is almost impossible Judicial discretion always favors
continuance of debts (Financial Sector)

Corruption and the need for political reform are seen by some as important development
challenges
*
*

*

Passing of the fiscal responsibility law is important, also for fighting of corruption (Congress)
Corruption is an important issue and requires a national debate (Church)
Political reform is important to reduce number of smaller parties and increase party loyalty,
reform will be undertaken for the second next elections to reduce resistance (Congress)

Environment

Interesting suggestions are made with respect to environmental policies. Some view the development strategy outlined in the PPA and the Eixos de Desenvolvimento as inconsistent
with environmental protection objectives, in particular in the Amazon Region.
*

The PPA still needs to reconcile its developmentalobjectives with environmental and social
concerns An example are the projected ezxos de desenvolvimento, many of which are based
on the introduction and/or growth of soy production in fragile ecosystem in the Amazon,
which are super-imposed geographically with the proposed corredores ecol6glcos which
have high environmental and biodiversity priorities (NGOs)

Page XLIV

Brazil Country Assistance Strategy

*

Positive environmental initiatives such as the Pilot Program's Demonstration Projects (PDAs)
should be disseminated and replicated Natural and water resources initiatives should be encouraged as an incentive for people to settle in and avoid migration process Too much attention is given to the Amazon at the expense of the "Cerrado" which experiences serious loss of
biodiversity (30% loss since 1960's) (NGOs)
* In environment and water resources, there is too much bureaucracy Concentration of resources with the Federal Governmentand constant changes in the federal structures make it
difficult to implement programs PROAGUA did not get the resources necessary for this
critical program (State NE)
* Debt for nature swaps should be revisited (Congress)
* Recuperation of the Rio Sao Francisconeeds to be achieved before Transposition should be
considered (State NE)
Bank Operational Issues
With respect to the CAS, many welcome the consultation process. Especially Civil Society
Organizations expressed desire for further consultation and public sharing of documents
*
*

X

*
*

Participants welcome the opportunity to dialogue with the Bank on its country strategy
(NGOs)
Welcome the Bank's CAS consultation efforts, but CAS consultation should include NGOs
together with members of Congress, especially the committee working on Social Issues
(NGOs)
The follow-up process to this CAS consultation will be important to demonstrate the Bank's
seriousness in being more transparent and accountable (NGOs)
The invitation by the Bank and the efforts at consulting civil society are appreciated, but there
should a second round of consultations in order to guarantee a broader consultation Also, the
final CAS document should be publicly distributed (NGOs)
Desire to know more about the Bank and its work, to meet again, and to expand the dialogue
(Church)
Bank should define, directly with civil society, strategic areas to work on, which may not
necessarily be part of the Government's program (NGOs)
The CAS should emphasize the issue of governance and how greater accountability and social control can help the Bank achieve better poverty-alleviationresults CAS should have results indicators to evaluate if it achieved its goals in 2 - 3 years from now (NGOs)

Specific suggestions are made with respect to Bank operations.
*
*
*
*
*

Bank's advisory services and focused up to date studies provide very significant value
New themes for the Bank could include culture and tourism, public safety, and legislative/political reform (State NE)
Bank has a role in increasing Central Bank technical expertise (Financial Sector)
Bank could provide credit enhancements for international bonds for environmental (rainforest) or social investments (land reform) (Academic)
Present social conditionalities used by the Bank in its economic adjustment package and projects such as the Pilot Agrarian Reform project are insufficient to guarantee adequate povertyalleviation results Social conditionalities should be stronger in some cases The Bank should
adopt a "pari-passu" mechanism in the Pilot Agrarian Reform program to ensure that the
Government continues to expend the needed funds in the traditional, expropriation-based
model while funding the new, market-based approach (NGOs)

* The Bank should also work with the Brazilian Government to streamline donations since
grants to the Brazilian Government (such as in the environmental area) take as long to process as loans. (NGOs)
Specific suggestions are made with respect to IFC operations.
•
*
*
*
•

Social responsibility should be pre-requisite for businesses to receive IFC loans, as a type of
conditionality. (NGOs)
The Bank should be more active in bringing the private sector into Bank-financed projects.
IFC could help. (State S/SE)
IFC should not favor the business elite but should make resources available to small and medium-sized enterprises. (State S/SE, Private Sector)
IFC should provide foreignwexchangeinnovationto reduce risk. (Financial Sector)
IFC should focus resources on intermodal transport. (Private Sector)

The list reflects principal areas of assistance from which the lending program will evolve contingent on the approval of individual loans by the Federal Govemment. The list is not meant to exclude other possibilities that
could eventually emerge, and are reflected in the strategy discussion in the text of the CAS.
41 For each project, indicate whether the strategicrewards and implementation risks are expected to be high (H),
moderate (M), or low (L).
*42 For some of these loans, the Federal Govemment has not yet provided final approval for loan preparation.
43
Selected loans from this list will substitute or complement loans from the previous list of investment loans for
FY01-02 up to a total of approximately 20 operations.
