Executive Summary
Costa Rica’s Development
Model: Enduring
Democracy, the Social
Compact, Open Economy,
and the Green Trademark
Sometimes referred to as the “Switzerland
of Latin America,” Costa Rica stands out for
being among the most politically stable, pro­
gressive, prosperous, and environmentally con­
scious nations in the region. This model has
brought important economic, social, and envi­
ronmental dividends, with sustained growth,
upward mobility for a large share of the popu­
lation, important gains in social indicators, and
significant achievements in reforestation and
conservation. Perhaps most important, the
country experienced shared prosperity, with
strong income growth of the bottom 40 percent
for many years, and poverty rates in Costa Rica
are among the lowest in Latin America and the
Caribbean.
Indeed, Costa Rica has had uninterrupted
democratic regimes since 1953, making it the
oldest working democracy in Latin America.
Following a two-month civil war in 1948, the
Legislative Assembly was democratically
elected to draft a new Constitution. The post–­
civil war administration also abolished the
army, and ever since Costa Rica has instead
relied on a police force to maintain order. In
1953, the first presidential elections under the
new Constitution were held, and since then
the country has held 15 additional elections
(the last in 2014), widely considered peaceful
and transparent. The country was not only an
Executive Summary

island of peace at a time when armed conflict
was predominant in Central America but it
also played a key role in the Esquipulas Agree­
ments that set the basis for the pacification of
Central America.
Likewise, the country’s Social Compact
traces its roots back to the middle of the 20th
century. Many of the central tenets of the So­
cial Compact were instituted during the
1940s–50s, including: (i) enacting the Labor
Code and establishing a professional civil ser­
vice isolating civil servants from changes in
the Executive; (ii) guaranteeing basic social
rights in the Constitution and adopting basic
welfare legislation; (iii) establishing a universal
health care system under the Costa Rican So­
cial Security Agency (Caja Costarricense de
Seguro Social, [CCSS]); and (iv) guaranteeing
public education for all. This ambitious Social
Compact has had the backing of high and ris­
ing social spending. Spending on ­education,
health, and social protection started to rise in
the 1950s, reaching over three percent of GDP
by 1958, nearly ten percent by the end of the
1990s, and then doubling during the first de­
cade of the 2000s. At 20.8 percent of GDP in
2012, Costa Rica’s social spending is one of the
highest in Latin America and on par with Or­
ganisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries.
And the Social Compact has achieved
many successes, particularly in the delivery
of universal services. Costa Rica’s trademark
universal and integrated health care system,
managed by the CCSS has provided access to
health care to its entire population, including
the poor and bottom 40 percent. It is widely
recognized that this health care system,
1

combined with the expansion of safe water
and sanitation, are the key reasons behind
Costa Rica’s impressive health outcomes:
life expectancy at birth improved from 61.6
years in 1960 to 72.5 years in 1980 and to
79.7 years in 2012, similar to the OECD aver­
age of 80.7 years. Almost 100 percent of all
births are attended by skilled medical person­
nel, and the infant mortality rate has fallen
from 90 to 10.6 deaths per 1,000 live births.
The social security and pension system has
also been quite inclusive, and today most of
the population is covered by at least one of
the programs, which have been extended
throughout the country and include contrib­
utory pensions, social pensions, workers’
compensation, and numerous social assis­
tance benefits. Finally, the country has also
shown a strong commitment to investing in
education, nearly reaching the spending tar­
gets of eight percent of GDP that were ap­
proved by the Assembly in 2010. The literacy
rate for adults 15 years old and above is al­
most universal (97 percent), and the share of
adults 25 years and above who had no formal
education has declined from 21.2 percent in
1950 to 3.4 percent today. Younger cohorts
are also attaining more years of education as
time goes by; for example, the cohort 25–29
years old had only about four years of educa­
tion on average in 1950; in 1980 it had on av­
erage a complete primary education (above
six years), and in 2010 it had a complete basic
education (nine years on average).
Costa Rica’s economy has been trans­
formed by its outward-oriented policies.
Trade openness has been a critical building
block of this model, dating back to 1963,
when Costa Rica joined the Central American
Common Market and to Costa Rica’s mem­
bership in the Caribbean Basin Initiative in
1983. But perhaps the most significant step
2

was joining the Central America Free Trade
Agreement (CAFTA-­DR), which provided a
more stable and reliable framework for Costa
Rica’s trade with the United States as its main
trading partner, introduced changes to the
legal framework to promote transparency, en­
sured a secure and predictable environment
for investors, and led to the breakup of gov­
ernment monopolies in the telecom and in­
surance sectors. Following CAFTA-DR, Costa
Rica has entered into further trade agree­
ments with Canada, China, The European
Union, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore, thus
consolidating its open economy. Another key
building block of the economic model was the
passage of the Free Trade Zones (FTZ) law in
1981, which started a wave of Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) into the country: first with
low-tech sectors (textiles), and gradually at­
tracting companies in high-tech sectors (elec­
tronics, advanced manufacturing, medical
devices and life sciences, and services for
export).
This outward-oriented development
model has been successful in attracting FDI
and moving Costa Rica up the global value
chains over the past two decades. The devel­
opment model has transformed the country
from a rural ­agriculture-­based economy in
the mid-1950s to one with high value-added
industries that contribute to several global
value chains. By 2014, FTZs accounted for 53
percent of exports, and Costa Rica’s economy
is very intensive in FDI (4.2 ­percent of GDP).
In this regard, the decision by Intel to set up a
semi-conductor assembly and test plant in
Costa Rica in 1996 was clearly a turning
point in attracting foreign investors. Indeed,
after Intel, other well-known multinationals
such as Abbott Laboratories (now Hospira),
Baxter Healthcare, and Procter and Gamble
have invested in the country; and by the late
Executive Summary

1990s manufacturing and services had over­
taken agriculture in their contribution to
GDP. Costa Rica’s exports are well diversified
with high-tech manufacturing and services
playing an increasingly important role. Costa
Rica contributes to at least five major hightech global value chains: electronics, medical
devices, automotive, aeronautic/aerospace,
and film/broadcasting devices. Electronics,
medical devices, and other manufactured
goods now make up about 60 percent of goods
exports. The increasingly diversified agricul­
tural portfolio (bananas, pineapples, coffee,
etc.) accounts for most other goods exports,
while low value-added products such as tex­
tiles are losing their relevance. Services ex­
ports (tourism, business services) also play
an important role in the economy and have
also diversified. Business services (mainly
Informa­tion and Communication Technol­
ogy, ICT, related) account for almost half of
all services exports.
Finally, Costa Rica has also built a
world-­renowned “Green Trademark” cen­
tered on conservation, reforestation, and
national parks. It is the only tropical coun­
try in the world that has reversed deforesta­
tion, increasing the area covered by forests
from 26 percent in 1983 to 52 percent today.
Reforestation is attributed, in part, to Costa
Rica’s Payments for Environmental Services
(PES) program, which provides incentives
for forest conservation and rehabilitation
of an average of 310,000 hectares per year of
privately owned lands over the past decade.
National parks and protected areas com­
prise 26 percent of land area in Costa Rica,
and they have become an important desti­
nation for tourists. Costa Rica also stands
out as the only country in Latin America
that has adopted the goal of achieving car­
bon neutrality by 2021.
Executive Summary

Indeed, the country is one of the most
visited nations in Latin America. In 2013,
close to 2.5 million tourists visited the coun­
try. This implies that the number of visitors
per capita (at around 0.5) is above popular
destinations in the Caribbean basin such as
Mexico (0.2), or the Dominican Republic
(0.38). While ­sun-and-beach tourism clearly
is part of Costa Rica’s attractions, eco-tour­
ism (an area where it has been a pioneer) is
also very popular with many travelers visit­
ing the national parks and protected areas.
Moreover, the country typically ranks at the
top of the Latin American Region Travel and
Tourism Competitive Index compiled annu­
ally by the World Economic Forum to mea­
sure the factors that make a destination
attractive for the travel and tourism industry.
These hallmarks of Costa Rica’s develop­
ment model have produced clear economic
and social dividends—and poverty rates
are among the lowest in Latin America and
the Caribbean. GDP per capita has tripled
since 1960 and now stands at US$13,876
(current PPP). Growth has averaged 4.5
percent between 2000 and 2013, above the
Latin American average of 3.8 percent.
Using a US$4 poverty line, only 12 percent
of the country’s population is considered to
be poor (less than half the Latin American
average). Taking a US$2.5 poverty line,
only 4.7 percent of the population is poor
(or about one-third of the Latin American
average). Moreover, only 1.4 percent of the
population lives under the US$1.25 poverty
line, well below the World Bank Group’s
Twin Goals poverty objective for 2030. Not
surprisingly, the middle class has become
the largest socioeconomic group of the coun­
try, comprising about 47 percent of the
population.

3

However, despite these impressive achieve­
ments, there are a number of emerging chal­
lenges that will need to be addressed to
main­tain the country’s successful develop­
ment path.
First, despite reasonable growth and a
strong commitment to the Social Compact,
poverty reduction has stagnated and in­
equality is rising. The long-term trend sug­
gests rising or stagnating inequality across
most of the past 25 years, in stark contrast
to the significant decline in inequality in
the broader LAC region. More recently, the
gap between the rich and poor has wid­
ened significantly since the global crisis.
Although growth recovered promptly after
the global crisis, above the regional aver­
age, job creation for low-skilled workers
has been feeble, contributing to rising un­
employment and pushing returns to higher
education upwards. Growth has been un­
even, with lower growth and job creation
in sectors that are more likely to employ
unskilled workers (e.g., construction and
agriculture). Not surprisingly, inequality
has increased, with the widening gap be­
tween the earnings of rich and poor work­
ers mirroring large disparities in human
capital and educational attainment. More­
over, despite high spending on social pro­
tection benefits and the broader Social
Compact, taxes and transfers have not
proven to be effective in redistributing in­
come to compensate for these disparities.
Consequently, rising inequality offset the
poverty-reducing impact of growth in the
late 2000s, and reversed what should have
been a decline in poverty between 2010
and 2014, with poverty increasing by 0.4
­percentage points instead of falling by a
projected three percentage points during
the post-crisis “recovery” period.

Second, Costa Rica has not converged to
countries of higher income, such as the US.
Unlike the top regional performers (Chile,
Panama, and Uruguay) Costa Rica’s per ca­
pita GDP has not shown any signs of conver­
gence towards the US level in the last 25
years. For example, in 1990, Costa Rica’s per
capita income was 13 percent of the US level,
approximately as it is today. At the same
time, the per capita GDPs of Chile, Panama,
and Uruguay have increased from 13, 12 and
9 percent of the US per capita GDP in 1990
to 21, 17 and 17 percent today, respectively.
Production costs that weaken the country’s
competitiveness prevent Costa Rica from
joining the top growth performers. These
production costs are affected by relatively
high wages that limit the country’s competi­
tiveness in low value-­added sectors, as well
as by a number of investment-­climate related
factors such as rising electricity costs, weak
infrastructure, and burdensome regulations.
And third, fiscal pressures threaten to
undermine the sustainability of the coun­
try’s Social Compact and Green Trademark,
and prevent it from undertaking much
needed investments in public infrastruc­
ture. Without fiscal consolidation, the defi­
cit could push public debt to unsustainable
levels and threaten the country’s economic,
social, and environmental gains. The fiscal
situation has deteriorated substantially
since the global crisis, with the overall defi­
cit of the Central Government growing to
5.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and is projec­
ted to have surpassed six percent in 2014
and to reach 6.6 in 2015. In tandem, public
debt increased from 25 percent of GDP in
2008 to 37 percent in 2013, with projections
of 63 percent by 2019 unless corrective
measures are implemented. This recent de­
terioration stems from counter-cyclical
Executive Summary

measures under-taken during the crisis and
structural forces that will require actions on
multiple fronts.
Moreover, the current political landscape
and institutional framework add an addi­
tional layer of complexity for approving and
implementing key reforms needed to address
these emerging challenges. The shift from a
two-party to a multi-party system in the last
fifteen years has resulted in more complex
and lengthy reform processes. The delays and
difficulties in passing comprehensive and
meaningful reforms, particularly on sensitive
issues such as tax reform, has resulted in a
mismatch between the demands of the popu­
lation and the “political delivery”. This is an
increasing concern given the growing need
to react and adapt quickly to changing global
developments. Likewise, capacity constraints,
related to weak sectoral planning and bureau­
cratic inefficiencies, also affect the ability of
the public sector to implement policies and
execute public investment projects.

Inclusion: Inequality,
Jobs, and Skills
Despite its progressive social
­policies and in contrast to the trends in the
Latin American region, inequality is rising
in Costa Rica. Long-term trends over differ­
ent periods indicate that inequality has ei­
ther increased or remained flat since the late
1980s. Changes in household survey meth­
odologies create problems of comparability
over time.1 During the period from 1989 to
2000, the Gini measure of inequality aver­
aged 0.45, rising from 0.44 in 1989 to 0.48
by 2000. During the period from 2001 to
2009, the Gini fell and then rose again, aver­
aging 0.50 across the period. Inequality has
Executive Summary

risen in recent years, averaging 0.52 during
the period from 2010 to 2014, which corre­
sponds both to a revised household survey
and the post-crisis recovery. In contrast, the
rest of Latin America witnessed a marked
decline in inequality, with the regional aver­
age falling by five points, from 0.57 in 2000
to 0.52 in 2012. As a result, Costa Rica has
gone from being the least unequal country
in LAC after Uruguay in 2000, to being
around the median country out of 17 coun­
tries for which internationally comparable
data exist for 2012.
Moreover, the incomes of the bottom
40 ­percent have fallen behind in recent years.
The recent changes in the income distribution
are also apparent when looking at the evolu­
tion of the incomes of the bottom 40 percent
of the population, which grew about two per­
centage points less than the mean income
growth between 2010 and 2012. The stub­
bornly high inequality level not only offset the
poverty-­reducing impacts of growth in the late
2000s, but also reversed what should have been
a decline in poverty of about three percentage
points between 2010 and 2014, into a poverty
increase of 0.4 percentage points.
The widening income gap between the
top and bottom quintiles of the population
reflects the mismatch between the pattern of
growth and employment versus the skills
profile of the workforce. As discussed above,
Costa Rica’s outward-oriented economic
model has favored the development of high
value-added sectors, such as electronics,
medical devices, IT business services, and so
forth. In contrast, lower value-added sectors,
such as construction, domestic services, and
agriculture, have grown more slowly—or
even contracted. Costa Rica’s push toward
high-end sectors has been quite successful. It
has also created excess demand for skilled
5

workers, increasing their market value. And
yet, Costa Rica has not sufficiently increased
its stock of high-skilled workers. Surpris­
ingly, despite the long-standing commitment
to invest in public education, less than half
of the cohort 25–29 years old had achieved a
secondary or higher education by 2010, fur­
ther adding to the stock of low-skilled adult
workers, a legacy of the 1980s crisis. Costa
Rica’s educational attainment is lower than
in peer countries in LAC (such as Chile and
Panama), and significantly lower than peer
countries in Europe (such as Croatia and
Lithuania), and far lower than graduation
rates in the OECD. Moreover, indicators of
the quality of education, such as OECD’s
PISA or UNESCO’s TERCE tests, place Costa
Rican students behind most countries with
spending at comparable levels. Even more
worrisome, scores on ­international tests have
worsened in recent years. Thus, the shift
from low to high value-­added sectors with­
out a corresponding increase in the stock of
skilled workers has produced the same result
on the distribution of income as Skill-Biased
Technological Change—where low-skilled
labor is gradually replaced by capital. And
yet, with low graduation rates, the stock of
unskilled workers ­continues to grow.
The labor-market effects of this structural
mismatch of skills and jobs have become
even more pronounced since the global cri­
sis. Job creation in sectors that employ mostly
low-skilled labor has been low or negative
since 2007. Unemployment started to rise
during the global crisis and has continued in­
creasing thereafter, reaching nine percent in
2014. The poor, women, and youth have been
disproportionately affected in their inability
to find jobs, as the sectors where job creation
has been minimal or even negative in the last

6

six years are those mainly employing lowskilled workers. Thus, it is no surprise that
unemployment increased the most for this
segment of workers. At the other end of the
spectrum, sectors that employ mostly highskilled workers, such as financial services,
real estate, personal services, and others, are
growing fast, pushing returns to higher levels
of education upward.
As such, the earnings gaps between rich
and poor and between the skilled and un­
skilled have widened since the “inflection
point” of the global crisis. Specifically, be­
tween 2007 and 2013, the earnings of those
in the top quintile increased relative to the
median earner (from 2 to 2.19), whereas
the earnings of workers in the bottom quin­
tile fell in relation to the median (from 0.52
to 0.29). A similar picture is seen in dispar­
ities by skill levels: for workers with tertiary
education, the ratio to the median income
increased (from 1.89 to 2.01), whereas the
ratio for workers with secondary complete
or incomplete remained flat, and for work­
ers with primary education or less the ratio
fell (from 0.79 to 0.73 of the median income).
Indeed, the returns to education have in­
creased alongside the rise in inequality in
Costa Rica, in contrast to trends in most
other LAC countries.
Furthermore, despite Costa Rica’s ambi­
tious Social Compact, taxes and transfers
have not proven to be effective in redistribut­
ing income to compensate for these dispari­
ties. This is explained by two main factors.
First, although revenue collection in Costa
Rica is on par with upper-­middle- and high-­
income countries (at around 22 ­percent of
GDP for general taxes plus social security
contributions and other revenues), general
tax revenues are low (13.5 ­percent of GDP),

Executive Summary

and the taxation structure is not very progre­
ssive. Since 1953, the Assembly has approved
1,259 tax exemptions (nearly half of them
with unclear definitions of the taxes ex­
empted), amounting to 5.6 percent of GDP.
Hence, the country has a limited ability to
counterbalance income inequality through
tax policies. Second, social assistance pro­
grams in Costa Rica are fragmented, with
fairly low coverage among the poor and weak
targeting accuracy. Even the most widespread
program (school meals) reaches only half of
the population in the lowest income quintile.
A large share of the non-poor benefit from
social programs, and the targeting accuracy
of programs is low compared to other coun­
tries. For example, only 44 percent of Costa
Rica’s conditional cash transfer program
(CCT) “Avancemos” go to those in the poor­
est quintile as compared with 74 ­percent of
CCT benefits under Panama’s “Red de Opor­
tunidades” Program.

Growth and
Competitiveness
Costa Rica’s average growth performance has been positive over the past de­
cades. As discussed above, GDP per capita
has tripled since 1960 against a 260 percent
increase in the region. Growth has averaged
4.5 percent between 2000 and 2013, above
the Latin American average of 3.8 percent.
Looking at the post global-­crisis period, the
country’s economy recovered similarly to a
set of comparator countries (Chile, Croatia,
Dominican Republic, Lithuania, Panama,
and Uruguay). Yet, as discussed above, since
1990 the country has not shown any sign
of convergence towards the US per capita

Executive Summary

income levels in contrast to the top perfor­
mers in the Latin American region.
Importantly, the country faces several
challenges to its competitiveness, and the
economy is showing signs of built-up vul­
nerabilities. These constraints reflect two
forces: the mismatch of skills and jobs, and
­investment-climate related factors.
First, relatively high wages have made
Costa Rica less viable in low value-added sec­
tors, while insufficient supply of skills ham­
pers competitiveness in high value-­added
sectors. On the one hand, high income levels,
coupled with generous social benefits, have
resulted in high reservation wages across the
board. Relatively high wages have made the
country less competitive in low value-added
sectors. On the other hand, the push toward
high value-­added sectors such as electronics,
medical devices, and IT services has been
quite successful; but insufficient supply of
high-skilled workers has created excess de­
mand for high skills. This, in turn, has put
upward pressure on the salaries of highskilled workers.
And second, numerous investment-cli­
mate-related factors hinder Costa Rica’s com­
petitiveness. Rising electricity costs, high
logistics costs, and burdensome regulations,
plus the appreciation of the real exchange
rate over the past eight years, are eroding the
country’s external competitiveness. Com­
bined with high wage costs, these costs have
made the country less competitive in low val­
ue-added sectors. For example, textile ex­
ports have dropped dramatically over the last
decade, falling from 13.3 percent of exports
in 2000 to 1.6 percent in 2014, and this trend
has been mainly attributed to high produc­
tion costs in Costa Rica compared to neigh­
boring countries. Although Costa Rica has

7

excelled in its push towards high value-ad­
ded sectors, weak infrastructure outside the
Free Trade Zones and low backward links
between export-oriented multi-national cor­
porations and local firms have limited poten­
tial spillover effects to the broader economy.
The quality of transport services and road
and port infrastructure in particular is rela­
tively weak. The appreciating real exchange
rate has also had negative ­consequences for
exports and the tourism sector, as well as for
FDI coming into or exiting the country. For
example, in 2014, Intel’s announcement to
relocate its microchip manufacturing plant to
Vietnam, and Bank of America’s subsequent
announcement of the closing of its service
center, have sparked renewed dialogue about
the importance of diversifying exports and
improving competitiveness. Although Intel
has maintained its engineering and design
services in Costa Rica, exports of electronics
contracted by almost 20 percent in 2014.
Still, export diversification has helped, and
strong growth in medical device production
has helped offset this contraction in
electronics.

Sustainability:
Fiscal, Social, and
Environmental
Pressures
Sustainability is threatened by the dete­
riorating fiscal situation. As in many other
countries, Costa Rica faced the global crisis by
implementing countercyclical fiscal policies.
This was welcomed given the magnitude of
the crisis and the fiscal space the country had
at the time (public debt was below 25 percent
of GDP in 2008). However, these policies
8

created structural pressures on the country’s
fiscal accounts: unlike other countries which
implemented temporary fiscal policies, Costa
Rica chose to implement steep, permanent in­
creases in public salaries in 2008–2010. As a
result, the wage bill of the central government
increased from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to
7.4 percent in 2014. At the same time, how­
ever, government revenues, which had risen
steeply prior to the crisis, dropped back to the
average level for 2000–05. Thus, the over­all
deficit of the central government grew, reach­
ing 5.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and it is pro­
jected to surpass six percent of GDP in 2014,
and reach 6.6 percent of GDP in 2015. As a
result, public debt increased by 12 percentage
points in five years, reaching 37 percent of
GDP in 2013, and is projected to surpass the
somewhat worrisome level of 63 percent of
GDP by 2019, unless corrective measures to
control expenditures and/or increase revenues
are implemented. However, such measures are
constrained by a number of rigid­ities in the
system, including numerous expenditure
mandates, earmarked revenues, and tax ex­
emptions. These rigidities leave only five per­
cent of the annual budget for strategic
allocative decisions in any given year. Further­
more, the budget process is fragmented, with
only the central government budget requiring
approval by the Legislative Assembly. Without
fiscal consolidation, the deficit could push
public debt to unsustainable levels and
threaten the country’s Social Compact and
Green Trademark.
Indeed, there are tensions between the high
level of social spending and Costa Rica’s ability
to deliver on its ambitious Social Compact. In
health, despite the country’s long-standing
commitment to universal coverage, important
“cracks in the system” reduce the efficiency of
this cornerstone of the Social Compact. The
Executive Summary

current organization of the system has led to
increasing wait times and patient frustration.
Out-of-pocket spend­ing has increased along­
side rising public spending on health, and
budget allocations do not take into account
demographic and demand changes, leading to
inefficiencies and inequities of health care.
Furthermore, an out­dated infrastructure and
information management system lowers qual­
ity and decreases transparency and efficiency
of resource management. In education, out­
comes have been particularly disappointing,
despite high public spending. Drop­out rates
are high, test scores are low, and the system is
not producing the skills needed to meet the
demands implied by Costa Rica’s pattern of
growth. Finally, despite high coverage of the
social protection system, different pension re­
gimes exacerbate inequities and social assis­
tance programs are fragmented and weakly
targeted, with limited impacts on poverty and
inequality. In the face of rising inequality com­
bined with the deterioration of the fiscal situa­
tion, these inefficiencies erode support for the
Social Compact. There are growing signs that
the middle and upper classes are slowly start­
ing to “opt out” of public services and pay for
private ones (as is widespread in other Latin
American countries). To the extent that this
process continues, it will seriously undermine
the commitment of these groups to finance
universal services that they no longer use, fur­
ther eroding the quality and legitimacy of the
system.
Similarly, Costa Rica’s global leadership in
environmental conservation faces the chal­
lenge of growing pressures on the use of re­
sources and of urbanization. First, the
Pay­ment for Environmental Service (PES)
model competes with rising land use opportu­
nity costs, which makes it fiscally unsustain­
able in the long run. Furthermore, the
Executive Summary

commitment to carbon neutrality entails not
only maintaining the current levels of forest
cover but also reducing the current levels of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all
sectors. While a large share of GHG emissions
can be achieved from better management of
forested and agricultural land, the country
also needs to reduce carbon emissions from
fossil fuels coming from transport, from con­
struction, and increasingly from general elec­
tricity consumption. This creates significant
trade-offs: the PES model is itself dependent
on revenues generated from taxes on gasoline;
and increasing the production of clean energy
necessitates in some cases intervening in pro­
tected areas. Second, urbanization has in­
creased air and water pollution, and there is
no long-term plan to protect the environment
from these threats. The country needs to im­
prove its infrastructure quality, from public
transportation to waste treatment capabilities.
Finally, the intensive use of agricultural land
has generated a worrisome level of agro-­
chemical use, and more generally the lack of a
proactive approach to territorial planning
jeop­ardizes the gains in environmental con­
servation. Put differently, the status quo is at
odds with the long-term goals of the country
in terms of environmental sustainability.

Governance
On top of the challenges affecting the
three basic pillars of development (inclusion,
growth, and sustainability), there is an addi­
tional one that cuts across the pillars: a public
sector administration that has not moder­
nized in tandem with the economy, therefore
limiting the State’s ability to deliver. Despite
Costa Rica’s good standing on governance
relative to the LAC region, both perceptions
and evidence suggest that its institutions and
9

procedures have not been able to adapt to the
challenges of a new economic and social en­
vironment. Governance challenges hamper
Costa Rica’s effectiveness in several ways.
First, in a governance structure where power
is spread across many actors, political grid­
lock has hampered the adoption of reforms
in many instances over the past decade(s). As
a result, a consequence of this gridlock in
passing reforms has been the proliferation of
an increasing number of public (and often
autonomous) institutions created to address
specific problems. Second, the budget process
and numerous earmarked expenditures re­
duce the margin for the executive to control
public investment and current expenses – or
to make strategic allocative decisions. Third,
public investment – ­particularly in infra­
structure – has been at a standstill for de­
cades. Various factors are named as obstacles
to the implementation of public infrastruc­
ture and social projects in the various line
ministries, such as the cumbersome pro­
cesses associated with the Public Procure­
ment Law, deficiencies in the environmental
regulatory framework, cumbersome checks
and reviews throughout the process, and so
forth. Fourth, perception and evidence sug­
gest inefficiencies in public service delivery
(as discussed below for basic social services).
And finally, the institutional complexity of
the public sector makes for convoluted pro­
cedures that increase transactions costs of in­
teracting with public institutions and service
agencies. The relatively poor ranking of
Costa Rica in the Doing Business Indicators
(ranking 83rd out of 189 countries in 2015) is
partly attributed to burdensome procedures
within and between public institutions. Costa
Rica also ranks poorly on indices of Protect­
ing Investors (181st), Enforcing Contracts
(129th), Paying Taxes (121st) and Starting a
10

Business (118th). It’s startling that a country
that depends so heavily on FDI fares so
poorly in those categories.

Priority Areas,
Links, and
Complementarities
Several threads weave across this “tril­
ogy” of challenges for inclusion, growth, and
­sustainability—and point to priority areas for
action. One thread involves the interactions
between inequality and growth, which hinge
on the mismatch of skills and jobs. Another
strand is the dual challenge of maintaining
competitiveness of high value-added sectors,
while enhancing the viability of traditional
low value-added sectors. Mounting fiscal
pres­sures threaten the sustainability of the So­
cial Compact and Green Trademark. Finally,
the challenges of governance also weave
across the development agenda, limiting the
capacity of the public sector to adopt reforms,
deliver services, and execute infrastructure
projects. These inter-connected challenges
highlight a number of priority areas that
Costa Rica needs to address to continue on a
sustainable and inclusive growth path.
Education and skills. Costa Rica needs
to build a skilled workforce to supports its
trajectory towards a high value-added
economy and to reduce the skills-income
gap. With fewer than half of young adults
graduating from secondary school, and
with performance on test scores falling,
Costa Rica’s labor supply does not appear
to be well adapted to generate the skills
needed for the labor market. Thus, building
a more skilled workforce will ensure that
the country remains competitive in high
Executive Summary

value-added sectors, and that more workers
can access these better paying jobs, includ­
ing those in the bottom 40 percent of the
population. As these changes are structural,
for the most part they are also long term in
nature. Workers cannot just “acquire an ed­
ucation overnight.” As such, tackling these
challenges will require a three-pronged ap­
proach: (i) strengthening the quality, reten­
tion, and relevance of the education system
(from pre-school through secondary
school)—which will help build the skills of
“tomorrow’s workers”; (ii) improving the
quality and relevance of tertiary education;
and (iii) strengthening the technical train­
ing system for the workforce.
Bold actions are needed to overhaul Costa
Rica’s education system. Given the country’s
level of development and high education
spending, the education system seriously un­
derperforms in quality (as demonstrated by
test results), retention (low completion rates),
and relevance (as indicated by low returns to
training and lower levels of education). Al­
though high rates of secondary school drop­
out are a symptom of the broader challenges
in the system, imbalances in the allocation of
public spending favor primary (41 percent)
and tertiary education (32 percent) with rela­
tively little allocated to the secondary level
(27 ­percent). Indeed, both the share of public
spending and the allocation per student in
secondary education are low by international
standards and given Costa Rica’s level of de­
velopment. Moreover, inequities in learning
outcomes start early in life—and affect moti­
vation and abilities to learn throughout the
school years. In addition to rebalancing
spending towards secondary school and early
childhood development, Costa Rica needs to
strengthen teacher quality and improve ac­
countability through regular monitoring with
Executive Summary

standardized learning assessments, and a
more effective governance and incentive
framework.
Given the high-skilled profile of job op­
portunities in Costa Rica, systemic efforts
are also needed to enhance the quality and
relevance of tertiary education. Currently,
the tertiary education system is heavily bi­
ased towards social science and humanities,
and produces few STEM (Science, Technol­
ogy, Engineering and Mathematics) gradu­
ates, further contributing to the skills
shortage in high value-added sectors. More­
over, outdated and bureaucratic procedures
for recognizing foreign degrees create obsta­
cles for Costa Rica to “import” the skills
needed to sustain its high value-­added
growth model. Quality and accountability
mechanisms are also needed, with perfor­
mance agreements with public universities
and quality accreditation standards for both
university and non-university tertiary
education
Finally, the country needs to expand the
offering and relevance of technical training,
which is the most direct way to build the
skills of the current workforce. Again, stron­
ger quality standards, certification of techni­
cal programs, and accountability of training
institutes could help. The National Learning
Institute (INA) could also improve coordina­
tion with private-sector employers to design
market-relevant curricula and course offer­
ings so as to better respond to the needs of
the growing sectors of the economy.
Competitiveness and the business
­climate. Boosting growth and inclusion in
the labor market requires confronting the
dual challenge of maintaining competitive­
ness of high value-added sectors, while im­
proving the viability of low value-added
11

sectors. For instance, improving the integra­
tion of export-­oriented and domestic firms
through backward linkages could sustain the
growth among small and medium enter­
prises (SMEs), generating jobs in mid- and
low-skilled occupations. This can be done
by lowering operation costs to improve the
productivity of labor and counterbalance the
high labor costs in Costa Rica compared to
its neighbors, for example by lowering the
costs of doing business through regulatory
simplification.
Infrastructure. Reducing the infrastruc­
ture deficit would increase competitiveness,
growth, and environmental sustainability.
Costa Rica’s historical efforts to build an
extensive network of infrastructure in
nearly all productive service areas (water,
sanitation, transport, electricity, and tele­
communications) are clear from the infra­
structure stock: the country has two times
the road and three times the rail density of
the average middle-income country; access
to electricity is nearly universal; and mo­
bile penetration is higher than the OECD
average. Yet, the near freeze in public infra­
structure investment until the 1990s, as
well as recent fiscal constraints, have taken
a toll on the country’s ability to upgrade
and maintain its infrastructure. Further,
the government has faced significant chal­
lenges in executing infrastructure invest­
ment in a timely manner. As a result, today
roads and ports have among the lowest
quality marks in the LAC region. Electric­
ity prices have doubled since 2007 due to
weather related variable hydroelectric out­
put, causing increased use of thermal units
and high operating costs, among other fac­
tors. This infra­structure deficit reduces the
potential of local firms to grow and create
12

jobs, and this is true in particular for firms
that operate outside Free Trade Zones
(FTZs). In addition, the country needs to
improve its waste management and clean
energy production capabilities to be able to
reduce GHG emissions, and water and soil
pollution. Infrastructure improvement
poses a number of tradeoffs, including the
need to intervene in protected areas (in the
case of clean energy production), as well as
the need to control the current fiscal defi­
cit. Given the necessity of continuing to in­
vest in infrastructure, and the reality of
fiscal constraints, Costa Rica must look for
options for private sector participation in
the maintenance and upgrading of its
infrastructure.
Both growth and inclusion would benefit
from the many complementarities involved
in improving education, competitiveness,
and infrastructure. A well-educated work­
force with relevant skills is fundamental for
sustaining economic growth and increasing
productivity. In parallel, closing the educa­
tion gap between the poor and non-poor is
also highly relevant for inclusion by provid­
ing opportunities those in the bottom 40
percent. Lowering the costs of doing business
will boost competitiveness across various
sectors. Furthermore, increasing infrastruc­
ture spending would stimulate construction,
thereby creating more jobs for the large stock
of low-skilled workers.
At the same time, actions are needed to
ensure the sustainability of Costa Rica’s de­
velopment model:
•

Fiscal sustainability: Improving the
fiscal stance to restore sustainability re­
quires ­reforms to manage expenditures
and increase revenues. On the expen­
diture front, these include containing
Executive Summary

•

the wage bill of the consolidated public
sector, as public sector wages, both in
government and more so in state-owned
enterprises and other public institutions,
are well above the private sector at all
employment categories; and reviewing
the fiscal sustainability of the pension
system, particularly of special pension
regimes in the public sector. In addition,
a comprehensive reform of the budge­
tary process is needed to ­increase effi­
ciency and transparency in all public
sector entities. Finally, curtailing the
earmarking of revenues, which cover
more than half of primary spending,
would make the budgetary process more
flexible. Comprehensive reforms are also
needed to increase revenues. For exam­
ple, the 1,259 tax exemptions approved
since 1953 that comprise almost six
percent of GDP need to be thoroughly
reviewed. Curtailing those exemptions
would make the tax system more ratio­
nal and progressive, as well as produce
higher revenues. This reform is essential
for restoring sustainability to the fiscal
accounts, which is a necessary condition
for achieving Costa Rica’s economic and
social objectives.
Social sustainability: In addition to
strengthening education, priority areas
for sustaining the Social Compact include
health and social protection. Costa Rica
needs to modernize its universal health
system to improve quality by: (i) strength­
ening the health care model to enhance
capacity to adapt to demographic and
epidemiological change while ensuring
quality and timeliness of service ­delivery;
(ii) improving the financial model of
budget and resource allocation; and (iii)
improving the management model for

Executive Summary

•

the health system for accountability, ef­
ficiency, and performance. The ­country
also needs to increase the effectiveness
of social protection programs by (i) har­
monizing eligibility criteria and social
information systems; (ii) improving per­
formance monitoring and evaluation; and
(iii) reducing institutional and program
fragmentation.
Environmental sustainability: To sus­
tain its celebrated “Green Trademark,”
Costa Rica needs to balance environmen­
tal and natural resource management
goals, by: (i) reviewing the sustainability
of the PES mechanism for conservation;
(ii) modernizing water and solid waste
treatment (infrastructure, ­service deliv­
ery, regulatory framework, capacity);
(iii) increasing the supply of renewable
energy by making regulations on the use
of protected areas more flexible; (iv) im­
plementing a comprehensive transport
policy, including measures to reduce
growth of demand for energy associated
with transport; (v) reinforcing regulation
and oversight of agro-chemical use and
incentivizing the expansion of “green”
(organic) agriculture; and (vi) improving
territorial planning, land management,
and management of natural and manmade disasters.

Governance. Progress in all the priority
areas discussed above hinges on improving
the capacity of the public sector to plan and
implement policies, execute public invest­
ment projects, deliver services, and increase
accountability. Despite Costa Rica’s good
governance levels compared to the rest of the
LAC region, there is a growing perception of
low effectiveness of government institutions.
Cumbersome regulations, in many cases
13

resulting from lack of coordination among
institutions, make the process of starting and
running a business—­particularly a non-FTZ
small or medium enterprise—more chal­
lenging. Low levels of transparency and ac­
countability lower the efficiency of public
spending. The current political landscape,
where political minorities have the power to
delay votes, further reduces the margin for
approving and implementing needed re­
forms. The need to improve governance is
apparent in all priority areas, for instance by
increasing accountability in the education
sector (e.g., by tracking student achievement
to reward teacher and school performance).
Employment creation would benefit from
streamlining business regulations as well as
the public procurement and investment pro­
cesses to improve infrastructure. A more
consolidated budget, fewer tax exemptions,
and more control over spending by autono­
mous institutions could greatly help to re­
duce the current fiscal deficit, and would
improve the capacity to monitor results of
public spending. In turn, results-based man­
agement would help to boost the efficiency
of public spending, for example, enforcing
the use of common information systems and
modernizing the M&E frameworks in the
social sectors.
An agenda for knowledge. Finally, a
number of knowledge gaps need to be

filled to inform better policy decisions. Al­
though there is a large and productive re­
search and policy analysis community
studying Costa Rica, there are a few issues
where having further research and data
collection would provide more information
to help design more concrete policy re­
forms to tackle the issues presented above.
For example, the specific factors driving
secondary dropout are still not well under­
stood. In the labor market, it is not clear
whether the contraction of employment in
agriculture, manufacturing and construc­
tion is of a cyclical or structural nature,
and this has important implications for
low-skilled unemployment. Likewise, al­
though there are strong signs that reserva­
tion wages are high, there could be more
studies to quantify this ­phenomenon bet­
ter. To improve the efficiency of the public
sector, it is crucial to identify the specific
governance bottlenecks in executing infra­
structure projects, as well as their cost im­
plications. Also, the articulation
mech­anisms to improve the effectiveness
of social programs need to be based on a
thorough institutional mapping of social
programs. Finally, environmental conser­
vation needs to be better linked with eco­
nomic activity, and a key knowledge gap in
this regard is how to link sustainable pro­
duction and rural landscapes
to conservation.

Note
1. The long-term trends in poverty and inequal­
ity are subject to caveats regarding income
measurement due to several changes in sur­
vey methodology across that time period.
The main “breaks” in comparability of the

data series occur in 2001 and 2010. As such,
measurement of welfare across the three time
periods of 1989–2000, 2001–09, and 2010–14
is not strictly comparable. See chapter 2 and

Executive Summary

1. Introduction and Country Context
Costa Rica is a small country, with ambitious economic, social, and environmental
goals. The country covers a land area of
19,700 square miles (51,100 square kilometers), with a population of 4.9 million, of
which about three-quarters live in urban
areas. An upper-­middle income-country,
with GDP per capita of US$13,876 (current
PPP), it is under consideration for membership to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with
discussions scheduled for this year. Costa
Rica’s development model centers on four
key pillars: its long-standing democracy, an
ambitious Social Compact, an outward-oriented economy, and its celebrated Green
Trademark. This model has achieved many
successes, including sustained healthy
growth rates, improvements in social indicators, environmental gains, and one of the
lowest poverty rates in the Latin America
and Caribbean region.
Anchored in a region rife with political
and social turmoil until the late 20th century,
Costa Rica stands out as the longest working
democracy in Latin America. The country—
one of the smallest in Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC)—started a process of de­
mo­cratic nation building back in the 19th
century, with the development of the coffee
industry. Stability and consensus were nurtured from the country’s early years and continued during the transition to the modern
democracy that started in 1949 (box 1.1).
Since then, elections have been held every
four years, with peaceful transitions of power
between political parties, making it the oldest
working democracy in
Introduction and Country Context

Latin America. There is a clear checks-andbalances system between the Executive and
the Legislative Assembly. Costa Rica’s political norms have long placed a high premium
on achievement of wide socio-political consensus on major policies. Participation in
elections remains high, with 70 percent voting in 2010 and 68 percent in 2014, although
it has declined from levels around 80 percent
during elections in the 1990s.1 This political
stability, which has earned Costa Rica the
label of “Switzerland of Latin America,” has
been attributed to several factors, including
the abolition of the army after a two-month
civil war in 1948, the limited presence and
power of land-based oligarchies, and the
1949 Constitution, which created one of
Latin America’s first welfare states.
The country has also forged a far-reaching
Social Compact, with universal access to basic
services and a long tradition of social rights.
Costa Rica’s Social Compact traces its roots
back to the middle of the 20th century, and is
founded on constitutional guarantees of basic
social rights, an extensive Labor Code, public
education, and a universal health care system
managed by the Social Security Agency (box
1.1). As a result, most of the population has
access to improved water sources (96 percent), sanitation (94 percent), and electricity
(99 percent).2 It is widely recognized that
Costa Rica’s universal health care system,
along with the expansion of safe water and
sanitation, are the key reasons behind its impressive health outcomes.3 Life expectancy at
birth increased from 61.6 years in 1960 to
79.7 years in 2012, just one year less than the
OECD average of 80.7 years. Almost all births

Historical Underpinnings of Costa Rica’s Social Compact

Costa Rica’s social contract has its roots in the pattern of its colonial settlement and the
structure of coffee production. Largely isolated, sparsely populated, and without precious
metals to export, Costa Rica was a uniformly poor subsistence economy during the colonial period (1600–1800). The farmers of the Central Valley worked their own land on
homesteads. Given the dominance of the farm household, Costa Rica has been described
as a “rural democracy” during this period, with minimal social divisions and few class distinctions, in contrast to neighboring countries.
Following independence in 1821, coffee production grew rapidly and became the engine of Costa Rica’s economic growth. Coffee became a driver for the development of
the country’s infrastructure, institutional organization, and productive structure.
Roads were built to export coffee to Europe. Coffee production accelerated moving
from communal land rights to the privatization of land, and the predominance of
small landholdings and the notion of individual property rights contributed to low inequality and shared wealth. Abundant land supply and labor scarcity contributed to
high wages, contributing to a more equitable distribution of the income from coffee
exports. As international demand increased, large exporters were forced to buy coffee
from the smallholders, while in turn smallholders depended on large exporters for the
beneficio—the hullery where coffee is washed, dried, and packaged for export—thereby
creating a strong mutual interdependence. By the middle of the 19th century, this facilitated the consolidation of the Coffee Pact—the implicit contract developed between
the large exporters and smaller producers. In part, this pact was feasible because Costa
Rica had a small territory with a small population concentrated in the Central Valley,
where all faced the same adversities and risks. The implicit contract was a social mechanism for dealing with these risks and overcoming the shortcomings of small size.
The social relationships implicit in the Coffee Pact gradually led to the emergence of a national egalitarian ideology that validated the participation of small producers and the
landless workers not only in the distribution of the economy’s product but also in the political arena. This led to Costa Rica’s version of the liberal state, in which the interests of
different sectors could be democratically expressed, rules were universally applicable, and
institutions and legal codes promoted the growth of economic activity and a democratic
society. Liberal governments created a legal framework that protected individual and pro­
perty rights, guaranteed market freedom, and placed multiple limits and counterbalances
on power.
This egalitarian ideology provided the underpinnings for Costa Rica’s notable Welfare
State. In 1941, President Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia created the social security system (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS) to provide public health services, which

have become universal since then. In 1943, a Labor Code was enacted and an article on
social rights (garantías sociales) was written into the Constitution of 1949. The social
rights included health, housing, social assistance, public services, taxes, and minimum
wages, among others.

are attended by skilled medical personnel,
and the infant mortality rate stands at 10.6
deaths per 1,000 live births, a vast improvement since 1960 which recorded 90 deaths
per 1,000. Moreover, by 2011 the literacy rate
for adults 15 years old and above had reached
97 percent, and the share of adults 25 years
and above who had no formal education was
3.4 percent in 2010. Younger cohorts are attaining more years of education as time goes
by. For example, the cohort of young adults
aged 25–29 years had only about four years of
education on average in 1950; in 1980 it had
on average a complete primary education (six
years); and by 2010 it had a complete basic
education (nine years on average). This is in
part the result of a strong commitment of the
society to invest in education, as reflected in a
recently approved constitutional mandate
(June 2010) to raise education spending from
six to eight percent of GDP.
Costa Rica’s economy has been transformed by its outward-oriented policies,
centered on trade openness, export diver­
sification, Free Trade Zones (FTZs), and
foreign direct investment (FDI). Trade
open­ness has been a critical building block
of this model, dating back to 1963, when
Costa Rica joined the Central American
Common Market (CACM, made up of El
Introduction and Country Context

Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and
­Nicaragua), which spearheaded trade integration in Central America, eventually
leading to a customs union. A second
milestone took place 20 years later (1983),
when Costa Rica joined the Caribbean
Basin Initiative, strengthening its trade relations with the United States. But perhaps
the most significant step was joining
CAFTA-­DR (the Dominican RepublicCentral America-­United States Free Trade
Agreement), which provided a more stable
and reliable framework for Costa Rica’s
trade with its main trading partner, the
United States, introduced changes to the
legal framework to promote transparency,
ensured a secure and predictable environment for investors, and led to the breakup
of government monopolies in the telecom
and insurance sectors. Following CAFTA-­
DR, Costa Rica has entered into further
trade agreements with Canada, China, the
European Union, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore, thus consolidating its open economy.
Another key building block of the econo­
mic model was the passage of the FTZ law
in 1981 (amended in 1990 and 2010),
which started a wave of FDI into the country: first with low-tech sectors (textiles),
and gradually attracting companies in
17

high-tech sectors (electronics, advanced
manufacturing, medical devices and life
sciences, and services for export).
This outward-oriented development
model has been successful in attracting FDI
and moving Costa Rica up the global value
chains over the past two decades. The development model has transformed the country
from a rural ­agriculture-based economy in
the mid-1950s to one with high value-added
industries that contribute to several global
value chains. By 2014, FTZs accounted for
53 percent of exports, and Costa Rica’s economy is very intensive in FDI (4.2 percent of
GDP). Exports are well diversified with
high-­tech manufacturing and services playing an increasingly important role. Costa
Rica contributes to at least five major hightech global value chains: electronics, medical
devices, ­automotive, aeronautic/aerospace,
and film/broadcasting devices. Electronics,
medical devices, and other man­ufactured
goods now make up about 60 percent of
goods exports. The increasingly diversified
agricultural port­folio (bananas, pineapples,
coffee, etc.) accounts for most other goods
exports, while low value-added products
such as textiles are losing their relevance.
Services exports (tourism, business services)
also play an important role in the economy
and have also diver­sified. Business services
(mainly Information and Communication
Technology, ICT, related) account for almost
half of all services exports.
Finally, Costa Rica has built a world-­
renowned “Green Trademark,” centered on
conservation, reforestation, and protected
areas. It is the only tropical country in the
world that has reversed deforestation, increasing the area covered by forests from 26
percent in 1983 to 52 percent today (box
1.2). Reforestation is attributed, in part, to
18

the Payments for Environmental Services
(PES) program, which provides incentives
to forest conservation and rehabilitation,
reaching an average of 310,000 hectares per
year of privately owned lands over the past
decade. Costa Rica has also set aside 26
percent of its land area for protected areas,
including national parks, which have become an important destination for tourists
(53 ­percent of tourists visited those parks
in 2012).4 Tourism has become a dynamic
sector, contributing 4.6 percent of GDP and
14.2 percent of total exports in 2013. Costa
Rica also stands out as the first country to
adopt the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2021 (box 1.2).
This development model has produced
clear economic and social dividends—and
poverty rates are among the lowest in Latin
America and the Caribbean. GDP per capita
has tripled since 1960 and now stands at
US$13,876 (current PPP). Growth has averaged 4.5 percent between 2000 and 2013,
above the Latin American average of 3.8 percent. Using a US$4 (2005 PPP) poverty line,
only 12 percent of the country’s population
is considered to be poor (less than half of the
Latin American average). Taking a US$2.5
poverty line, only 4.7 ­percent of the population is poor (or about one-third of the Latin
American average). Moreover, only 1.4 percent of the population lives under the
US$1.25 poverty line, well below the World
Bank Group’s Twin Goals poverty objective
for 2030.5 Not surprisingly, the middle class
has become the largest socioeconomic group
of the country, comprising about 47 percent
of the population.
However, despite these impressive achievements, underlying vulnerabilities challenge
Costa Rica’s development model. There is a
sense that, although Costa Rica has achieved

Costa Rica’s Celebrated Green Trademark

Costa Rica takes up only 0.03 percent of the earth’s surface but is considered to be one of
the 20 countries with the greatest biodiversity in the world, with 52 percent covered by
forests and 26 percent in protected areas. This was not always the case. Although more
than half of the country was covered by forest in 1950, deforestation had stripped this to
just 26 percent by 1983 under the pressures of a growing population and massive conversion of forest to pasture, underpinned by ­policies that supported cattle ranching and agricultural development.
Green Framework and Payments for Environmental Services. Recognizing the potential
economic and global value of the forests and the risks to environmental degradation of
rapid deforestation, several framework laws established the basic principles of Costa Rica’s
“Green Trademark” aimed at rehabilitating wooded lands and setting aside vast areas of
land as protected areas. It took years of policy debate and consensus building to develop
a national approach of paying for environmental services—which now takes the form of
the world-renowned Payments for Environmental Services (PES) program. This program
builds on a long chain of earlier legislation that made the costs of reforestation tax deductible (Forest Law No. 4475 of 1969), established reforestation as a legal imperative
(Forest Law No. 6184 of 1977), and established fiscal incentives through the creation of
certificates that rewarded landowners for reforestation and allowed for significant forest
authority intervention in the use of forest resources (Forest Laws No. 7032 of 1986 and
7174 of 1990).
The PES was formally established in 1995 when the government adopted Forest Law
No. 7575. This law established a framework for payments to landowners for these ecosystem services, and established the National Fund for Forestry Financing (Fondo
Nacional de Financiamiento Forestal, FONAFIFO), to manage the PES and established
a new certificate for forest conservation to reward landholders for their ecosystem services. Besides the 1995 Forest Law, the government enacted other environmentally related laws: (i) the 1995 Environment Law No. 7554, which mandates a “balanced and
ecologically driven environment for all”; (ii) the 1996 Forest Law No. 7575, which mandates “rational use” of all natural resources and prohibits land cover change in forests;
and (iii) the 1998 Biodiversity Law, which promotes the conservation and “rational use”
of biodiversity resources and includes measures to conserve, protect, and sustainably
exploit biological resources to ensure quality of life for future generations and the survival of natural heritage. Subsequently, the Fiscal Simplification and Efficiency Law No.
8114 (2001) fixed FONAFIFO’s share of fuel tax revenues to 3.5 ­percent, guaranteed
through the Ordinary National Budget. In addition, the Decree of the President of the

Republic No. 32868 in 2005 (“Inaugurating and Regulating a Water Charging Scheme”)
introduced a mandatory payment for ecosystem services via instituting a water tariff
structure through which 25 percent of the proceeds from water charges are allocated to
the PES Program.
National Parks and Protected Areas. The National System of Protected areas was introduced
in the late 1980s, followed by the National System of Conservation Areas (Sistema Nacional
de Áreas de Conservación, SINAC) was created in 1994 to organize the country into 11
large conservation areas, most of which are based around a major national park, to avoid a
situation in which the protected areas would serve as isolated “green islands” in an otherwise improperly managed landscape. SINAC oversees over 160 protected areas, of which
26 are designated national parks. Other areas are designated wildlife refuges, biological reserves, national monuments, forest reserves, national wetlands, and protected zones.
Carbon Neutrality. In May 2007, the Costa Rican government announced its intention to
become 100 percent carbon neutral by 2021. Efforts are underway to begin offsetting all of
the country’s carbon dioxide emissions using a wide range of budgetary, legal, and financial incentives including measures to promote biofuels, hybrid vehicles, and clean energy.
Another key component of the national strategy will be a “C-Neutral” label to certify
that tourism and certain industrial practices mitigate all of the carbon dioxide they emit.
Under the new certification system, tourists and businesses would be charged a voluntary
“tax” to offset their carbon emissions, with one ton of carbon valued at US$10. The funds
would be used for conservation, reforestation, and research in protected areas.

impressive “levels” of performance for many
indicators (relatively low poverty rates, long
life expectancy, near-universal literacy, environmental conservation), it is increasingly becoming constrained on the “deltas” of
ado­pting the changes needed to make the
transition to a modern, higher-­income economy that is aspiring to join the OECD. These
“cracks in the system” are apparent in many
dimensions: rising inequality; growing unemployment, especially among the poor; consistently high school dropout rates; increasing
20

dissatisfaction in the quality of the health care
system; rising electricity costs; a near halting
of infrastructure investment; increasing air
and water pollution; and the deteriorating fiscal balance. In turn, these risks are symptoms
of deeper structural problems in the economy
and the public sector. The implications of
these challenges are worrisome: although the
economy is expected to continue to grow at
healthy rates, poverty reduction has stagnated,
the incomes of the bottom 40 percent are falling behind, and inequality is rising.
Introduction and Country Context

These challenges affect the basic pillars underlying poverty reduction and shared prosperity: inclusion, growth, and sustainability.
••

••

••

On the inclusion front, inequality is
rising, despite the country’s progressive
policies and ambitious Social Compact—and in contrast to the marked
decline in inequality in much of the
LAC region. Consequently, inequality
offset the poverty-reducing impacts of
growth in the late 2000s, and reversed
what should have been a decline in
poverty, with poverty increasing by 0.4
­percentage points instead of falling by
a projected three percentage points
during the post-crisis recovery period.
The widening income gap between rich
and poor reflects changes in the labor
market, weak educational outcomes,
and a mismatch between the pattern
of growth and the skills profile of the
workforce.
On the growth front, although Costa
Rica’s growth performance over the
past decades has been positive, it has
not made much headway in convergence with the United States, lagging
behind structural peer ­countries, such
as Chile, Panama, and Uruguay. More­
over, the country faces several chal­len­
ges to its competitiveness, including
the mismatch of skills and jobs, invest­
ment-climate related factors, production
costs, and weaknesses in public-­sector
administration. As a result, the economy is showing signs of built-up
vulner­abilities.
And finally, on the sustainability front,
the deterioration of fiscal balances, tensions in the Social Compact, and various
risks to the Green Trademark all combine

Introduction and Country Context

to threaten Costa Rica’s development
model. The fiscal situation stands out as
one of the most pressing development
challenges facing Costa Rica. The recent
deterioration stems from a combination
of countercyclical measures undertaken
during the crisis and structural forces.
Without fiscal consolidation, the deficit
could push public debt to ­unsustainable
levels and threaten the country’s economic, social, and economic gains.
Indeed, fiscal pressures, as well as rising
inequality, and increasing dissatisfaction
with social services all combine to create
tensions in the social compact. Finally,
Costa Rica’s leadership in ­environmental
conservation faces the challenge of
growing pressures on the use of resources
and of urbanization. Changing economic
incentives threaten the gains in reforestation, and the use of agro-­chemicals is
worrisome. Urbanization has increased
energy use, as well as air and water pollution; and the country has not ­developed
a long-term plan to ­protect the environment from these threats.
This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD)
takes stock of Costa Rica’s path to success, and
reflects on the development constraints and
opportunities that the country faces going forward. It does so through diagnostics of the
trends, drivers, and challenges to provide elements to answer three basic questions:
1. To what extent has the Costa Rican
development model been inclusive?
2. What has driven growth in Costa Rica
in recent years, and what are the bottlenecks that need to be addressed?
3. How sustainable is the development
model of Costa Rica economically,
socially, and environmentally?
21

The SCD is organized as follows. Chapter 2 examines trends in poverty and
shared prosperity. Chapter 3 assesses the
inclusiveness of growth, with a focus on
the challenge of rising inequality and the
mismatch of labor opportunities and the
skills of the workforce, with implications
for the poor and the bottom 40 percent
of the population. Chapter 4 analyzes the
drivers of growth, as well as key constraints to growth looking forward. Chapter 5 identifies risks to the sustainability
of development, including growth, the

delivery of public services, and the green
trademark of the country. Finally, based on
the previous analyses and a participatory
process with partners and stakeholders in
Costa Rica as well as within the WBG,6
Chapter 6 identifies priority areas for policy to ensure that Costa Rica stays on a
sustained path of growth, inclusiveness,
and shared prosperity. In several parts of
the analysis, this SCD relies on comparisons with other countries, including regio­
nal peers, structural peers, and aspi­rational
peers (OECD countries).7

Introduction and Country Context

2. Poverty and Shared Prosperity
Poverty rates in Costa Rica are among the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean, and
the middle class is the predominant group. Nonetheless, poverty increased and then stagnated
during and after the global crisis. The patterns of poverty show an uneven level of develop­
ment in the country, with the Central region being more prosperous relative to the peripheral
regions. Moreover, income inequality is rising, in contrast with the historical decline observed
in most countries in Latin America. Consequently, inequality offset the poverty-reducing im­
pact of growth in the late 2000s, with poverty rising instead of declining despite economic
growth.

Poverty: Relatively Low
Levels, but Recent
Stagnation
One of the great outcomes of Costa
Rica’s sustained GDP growth and Social
Compact is the reduction of poverty that
took place over the second half of the 20th
century. The poverty headcount—measured
with an internationally comparable poverty
line of US$4 per day—was reduced from
around 40 percent in 1989 to 27 percent by
the turn of the century. Poverty decreased
further to 18 percent in 2007, falling at a
rate of about 1.5 percentage points per year
(figure 2.1a). However, poverty reduction
stagnated during and after the global crisis.
Trends for extreme poverty—defined internationally in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) as per capita income under
US$2.50 a day—are similar, with a sustained
fall from 14 percent in 2001 to seven percent in 2007, and a slower decline after
2010 to an average of five percent.1 Costa
Rica’s poverty rate of 12 percent was the
lowest in Latin American after Argentina

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

(11 percent), Chile (10 percent), and
­Uruguay (8 percent) and less than half of
the LAC average in 2012.
Official poverty figures show a modest
decline since the 1990s, and a stagnation of
poverty since 2010. Using the official poverty line and the per capita income aggregate, overall poverty in Costa Rica declined
from around 31 percent to 19 percent between 1989 and 2007 (figure 2.1b). Poverty
reduction followed a cyclical pattern: after a
period of sharp decline in 1989–1994, poverty stagnated until 2000; then during the
economic expansion of 2001–2007, it declined modestly at about 0.6 percentage
points per year. The global crisis reversed
some of these gains, causing poverty to increase to 21.6 percent in 2009; and it has remained stable during the 2010–2014 period
at around 24 percent. Extreme poverty followed a similar pattern, declining from 9.9
percent to 3.7 percent between 1989 and
2007, and then increasing to 5.2 in 2009.
Extreme poverty has averaged 7.2 percent
in 2010–2014. By 2014, the number of poor
amounted to 1.17 million, including 0.45
million of extreme poor (box 2.1).2

Box 2.1 How Have Methodological Changes Affected Poverty Measures
in Costa Rica?
The analysis of trends in poverty and inequality over time must be treated with some
caution due to changes in methodologies used both for the collection of household survey
data and for the calculation of poverty lines in Costa Rica.
Two household surveys are used to measure poverty from 1989 to 2014, but they do not
allow for comparisons on poverty rates. The surveys are Encuesta de Hogares de Propósitos
Múltiples (EHPM) up to 2009 and the Encuesta Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO) from 2010
to 2014. Several improvements in the methodology to estimate household incomes were
introduced in the ENAHO. For example, the new questionnaire includes more and better
questions on labor and non-labor income; the consumption basket was revised using the
consumption patterns found in the 2004 National Income and Expenditure Survey; and
there were methodological changes in how to adjust for under-declaration of incomes and
the imputation of labor income.

Costa Rica uses two income-based poverty lines, one for extreme poverty and another for
overall poverty. The extreme, or “food,” poverty line is the value of the basic food basket
required for an individual to meet the minimum caloric intake. The overall poverty line
considers other basic resources beyond food.
A methodological change in calculating the poverty line was also introduced with the
ENAHO. Before 2010, both components of the poverty line were adjusted using the food
consumer price index (CPI). This was likely to have resulted in overestimation of poverty
when food prices were rising faster than overall prices, as happened in 2007–2009. In 2009,
for example, the poverty rate would have been 18.7 percent, about three percentage points
lower, if the non-food component of the poverty line had been updated using the general
CPI (Figure B2.1.1). Since 2010, the official poverty line is adjusted using the food CPI for
the food component of the poverty line and the non-food CPI for the non-food part.
Comparing Costa Rica’s poverty rates with those of other countries presents a series of
challenges, but harmonized survey data are available for that purpose from the SocioEconomic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC). The harmonization was developed by the Center for Distributional Labor and Social Studies (CEDLAS)
at the University of La Plata, Argentina, and the World Bank. The harmonized survey
data allow for cross-country comparability of poverty and inequality measures. However,
per capita income and poverty lines from SEDLAC differ from official estimates. Extreme
poor are individuals with a harmonized per capita income lower than US$2.50 a day,
while poor are individuals with a harmonized per capita income lower than US$4 a day
(2005 PPP). International comparable data from SEDLAC are available only up to 2012.

Profile of the Poor:
Increasingly Urban, Larger
Households, and Lower
Educational Attainment
Spatially, poverty rates are the lowest
in the Central region, as compared to the
other regions. Poverty rates vary significantly across the country (figure 2.2a). In
particular, poverty rates are as high as
26

35 percent in the Brunca and Chorotega
regions, as compared with 19 percent in
the Central region.
In terms of their numbers, however, the
poor are concentrated in the Central Region.
About half of the 1.7 million poor Costa Ricans
live in the Central region, with the other half
distributed almost evenly across the rest of the
country (­figure 2.2b). The relative high concent­
ration of poor in the Central region mirrors
population density as this region concentrates

population.
Regional disparities are significant, and
poverty rates are much higher in the border
areas. The 2011 county-level map of income
(monetary) poverty produced by INEC reveals a large heterogeneity of poverty rates
within and across regions.3 In particular,
poverty rates range from over 50 percent
along the border with Nicaragua and Panama to less than 15 percent in some counties located in the Central region (figure
2.3a). The cantons with the highest poverty
rates are also those where most of the indigenous population lives (box 2.2). Interestingly, the poverty map also shows a high
concentration of poor households, with almost a quarter of poor households

Rica in 2011 (figure 2.3b).
Poor and non-poor households have significantly different characteristics. Table 2.1
compares the profile of the poor and the
non-­poor, as well as those in the bottom 40
and top 60 percent of the income distribution
in 2014. Non-poor households tend to have
higher levels of human capital: heads of house­
hold had nine years of education on average
among the non-poor, compared with about
five years among poor and extreme poor
households. The poor and extreme poor belonged to larger households compared to the
non-poor. They were also more likely to live
in households with larger dependency ratios

poor; the proportion of individuals 12 years

old or younger in poor households was twice
as large as that observed in non-poor households in 2014.
Income-generation capacity also varies. For
example, the average per capita income of the
non-poor is 17 times higher than the income
of the extreme poor and seven times higher
than the income of the overall poor. The poor
are more likely to work in the agricultural sector and to be self-employed, while the non-­
poor tend to work more in services and to be
formally employed. The poor are also more
likely to live in female-headed households, but
non-poor women are twice as likely as poor
women to participate in the labor force.
Indicators of “multidimensional poverty” improved between 2000 and 2011.

Despite the modest reduction in income
(monetary) poverty reduction that the
country experienced during the first decade
of the 2000s, the 2011 Census revealed a
significant reduction in the percentage of
households considered poor from a multidimensional measure, related mostly to improved access to basic infrastructure and
services.4 Thus, the percentage of households in multidimensional poverty—that is,
who did not meet one or more of the four
basic conditions—dropped from 36.1
­percent in 2000 to 24.6 percent in 2011.5
The share of households who did not meet
the “education” component of the multi-­
dimensional indicator fell from 15.2 to
8.3 percent, as school attendance of

Box 2.2 Indigenous People in Costa Rica: A Very Small and
Disadvantaged Minority
Costa Rica’s indigenous population is small, but occupies a vast share of the land. In the Latin
American region as a whole, indigenous people make up about seven percent of the total
population (over 36.6 million people). In comparison, in Costa Rica they represent 2.4 percent
of the population (104,143 indigenous people). As such, Costa Rica, along with El Salvador, is
the country with the smallest proportion of indigenous people in the entire region. In terms of
land, legally established indigenous territories cover about seven percent of the Costa Rican
territory (about 350 thousand hectares), but 91 percent of the indigenous population is
concentrated in three cantons—Talamanca, Buenos Aires, and Hojancha (figure B2.2.1).
In the first decade of the 2000s, the indigenous population experienced a similar demographic transition as the rest of the Costa Rican population, with a falling share of children and a growing share of elderly adults. The dependency rate fell from 108 percent in

2000 to 79.8 percent in 2011, showing the sharp decline in the share of children that resulted from a decline in fertility rates, from 9.6 to two between 2000 and 2011, together
with an increase in the share of elderly adults, from four percent to 8.8 percent. Even if indigenous households are still larger than non-­indigenous (3.6 versus 3.4 people per household) these differences have been falling over time.
Historically, indigenous populations have had lower access to basic services than the non-­
indigenous. Despite a broad coverage of basic services to most of the population of Costa Rica,
indigenous people still lag behind in access to electricity, water supply, and sewage. According
to the 2011 Census, 80 percent of indigenous households had an electricity connection,
against 99 percent of non-indigenous. Still, compared to other indigenous populations in
LAC, access to electricity is higher than in Colombia (58 percent), El Salvador (62 percent),
Nicaragua (50 ­percent), or Panama (40 ­percent). As for access to clean water, 31 percent of the
indigenous population had no access to sewage (public or private), against four percent of
non-​indigenous. And only 67 percent had access to piped water, against 94 percent of non-­
indigenous (­figure B2.2.2). However, these indicators have improved significantly since 2000,
as the 2000 Census reported that only 53 percent of households had access to clean water,
50 percent had access to some form of sewage, and 67 percent had electricity. In addition the
share of households living in overcrowded conditions fell from 30 percent to 11 percent.
Human capital accumulation and income generating opportunities are also lower for indigenous populations. Indigenous people report lower educational attainment than non-­
indigenous: average years of education among the indigenous is 6.1, against 7.7 for
non-indigenous (although this shows progress from the 3.9 years on average in 2000).

Illiteracy is at 7.7 among indigenous and 2.2 among non-indigenous, and attendance to
formal education among people 5–24 years old is 64.9 against 71.7 for non-indigenous.
This translates into lower employment and income opportunities among the indigenous,
as they have a higher probability of working in self-employment or unpaid work, and to
be doing household chores rather than studying, for those who do not have an income-​
generating activity (figure B2.2.3).

children ages 7–17 increased and repetition
fell. At the same time, in 2011, 9.3 percent
of households did not satisfy the “health”
condition, while 7.8 percent did not satisfy
the “consumption” condition, and 6.2 percent did not satisfy the “housing” condition
(still, all three measures were lower than in
2000). Increased access to piped water and
sewage, increased access to electricity, and
a lower dependency ratio contributed to reducing the share of households who did not
meet these conditions.

Shared Prosperity and the
Rise of the Middle Class
Nearly half of Costa Ricans are classified
as “middle class.” The middle class, internationally defined as the share of the popula­tion
that lives on US$10 to US$50 per day, has expanded significantly, from 32 ­percent of the
32

population in 2001 to almost 47 percent by
2012, mirroring trends in the LAC region
(figure 2.4a). As figure 2.4b shows, Costa
Rica’s middle class is among the largest in
LAC in percentage terms, surpassed only by
Argentina (54 percent) and Uruguay (57 percent). Still, about one-third of the population
(those with incomes between US$4 and
US$10 a day) remains vulnerable to falling
back into poverty if hit by a shock.
Upward mobility has contributed to the
rise of the middle class. Trends in the share of
poor and the middle class conceal movements
in and out of poverty. Between 2003 and 2009
(a period for which comparable data exist for
Costa Rica), increasing incomes resulted in
important upward mobility. About 17 percent
of Costa Rica’s population (57 percent of the
originally poor) escaped poverty during those
years (figure 2.5).6 At the same time, however,
about eight percent of the total population fell

into poverty, including 11 percent of those who
were previously non-poor. Downward mobility
was higher in Costa Rica than in the LAC region, while upward mobility was lower. About
23 percent of the total population of LAC (half
of the originally poor) escaped poverty between
2004 and 2012, while only four percent (about
two percent of originally non-poor) moved into
poverty during those years.
Costa Rica experienced many years of
shared prosperity, with the incomes of the
poorest 40 percent growing faster than the
average. Income growth of the bottom 40
­percent was six percent between 2003 and
2007, higher than the mean income growth
of 3.9 percent. Moreover, the incomes of
those in the bottom 40 percent also grew
faster in Costa Rica as compared with their
counterparts in other countries in the LAC
region (figure 2.6a).
However, after the global financial crisis, shared prosperity declined and the
34

incomes of the poorest fell behind. Income
growth for the bottom 40 percent fell to 1.6
percent over the period from 2007 to 2012,
significantly lower than average income
growth in Costa Rica (3.4 percent) and
among the lowest in LAC (figure 2.6b).
This lower income growth for those in the
bottom 40 percent of the population did
not allow many individuals to escape poverty after 2010, and poverty reduction
stagnated.
Before the crisis, even the poorest regions
benefitted from shared prosperity. Between
2003 and 2007 there was some income convergence across regions, with the ­incomes of
the bottom 40 percent growing at more than
10 percent in Brunca and Chorotega (the
poorest regions in the country), against 3.4
percent in Central region (figure 2.7a). Even
in the Central region, incomes at the bottom
40 and at the average grew at similar rates.

regions, average incomes grew faster than incomes at the bottom, reversing the pre-crisis
trend in shared prosperity.

Rising Inequality, in
Contrast to Regional
Trends
Income inequality has risen or stagnated since the 1990s. Changes in household survey methodologies create problems
for the comparability of measure of inequality over time (box 2.1).7 Nonetheless, longterm trends over different periods indicate
that inequality has either risen or remained
flat since the late 1980s. During the period
from 1989 to 2000, the Gini measure of inequality averaged 0.45, rising from 0.44 in
1989 to 0.48 by 2000. During the period
from 2001 to 2009, the Gini fell and then

36

rose again, averaging 0.50 across the period.
Inequality has risen in recent years, averaging 0.52 from 2010 to 2014, a time period
that corresponds both to the post-crisis recovery and to the period covered by the
new ENAHO household survey (box 2.1).8
In contrast, the rest of Latin America
witnessed a marked decline in inequality,
with the regional average falling by five
points, from 0.57 in 2000 to 0.52 in 2012
(­figure 2.8a).9 As a result, Costa Rica has
gone from being the least unequal country
in LAC after Uruguay in 2000, to being
around the median country by 2012.10 In
non-LAC OECD countries, income inequality has been consistently much lower,
with a Gini coefficient 0.30 in 1995–2012.
Rising inequality in Costa Rica is underpinned by the widening gap between the
earned incomes and skillset of rich and
poor workers in Costa Rica (see chapter 3).
Similar to most countries in LAC, income is highly concentrated among the

rich in Costa Rica. About 22 percent of income is held by the rich in Costa Rica, a
similar share to the average in LAC (figure
2.8b). The top 20 percent of the population
earns 54 percent of the income, while the
share of income going to the middle class—
spanning the 48th to 96th centiles of the pop­
ulation in 2012—amounts to 61 percent.
The average income of the rich was 10.3
times higher than that of the poor in Costa
Rica, slightly higher than the LAC ratio
(9.5 times).
Within the country, inequality varies across
regions. Brunca, Norte, and Chorotega are the
regions with the highest income inequality,
while Pacifica and Atlantica are the least unequal (­figure 2.9a). It is interesting to note that

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

inequality fell since 2010 in all but the Central
region, where the capital city of San Jose is located. Thus, the Central region seems to have
driven the overall increment of the Gini by one
point. The weight of the Central region in explaining the overall Gini is confirmed by fi
­ gure
2.9b, which shows that inequality in the Central region accounts for three-quarters of total
inequality in Costa Rica.

Limited Poverty
Responsiveness to Growth
During the 2000s, poverty was not very
responsive to growth in Costa Rica. Indeed,
the elasticity of poverty to growth has been
low: between 2001 and 2007, a one percent

increase in GDP per capita was associated
with only a 0.60 percent reduction in the official poverty rate.11 In comparison, the poverty-growth elasticity in LAC over the same
period was much higher, reaching 1.43. After
the global financial crisis, the growth-poverty
elasticity decreased even further in Costa
Rica, to 0.44 over 2010–13, whereas in LAC
it increased further to 2.0 in 2010–2012.12
This low ­poverty-growth elasticity in Costa
Rica was also observed for periods before
2000, particularly during the 1990s.13
The global financial crisis marks a clear
inflection point, after which the incomes in
the wealthiest deciles grew significantly faster
and the poor fell behind. Growth incidence
curves (figure 2.10) reveal that before 2007,
growth was largely pro-poor. Indeed, the incomes of the bottom deciles of the income
distribution grew faster than those in the top
deciles. During and after the crisis, however,
the incomes of those in the poorest deciles
38

fell, further widening the gap between the
poor and the rest of the population.
Over time, rising inequality and price
­effects have offset the contribution of
growth to poverty reduction. Changes in
income poverty stem from growth, inequality, and inflation. Inflation could affect poverty through its effects on real wages, cost
of goods and ­services, and the regressive
nature of the inflation tax. Costa Rica’s success in controlling inflation could suggest
progress in poverty reduction. A decomposition of changes in poverty suggests shifting effects of these factors (figure 2.11).
During the pre-crisis period, poverty fell by
3.8 percentage points, helped by strong
growth and changes in inequality that positively affected the bottom end of the income
distribution. However, these gains were
partially offset by rising prices. During the
global crisis, growth slowed, food prices
rose, and inequality worsened—so that the

net effect was an increase in poverty of 2.6
percentage points during these years (2007–
09). Finally, in the post-crisis recovery period, rising inequality more than offset the
positive contribution of growth to poverty
reduction, such that poverty rose slightly

during that period (2010–14). If income in­
equality had not increased, growth alone
would have decreased poverty by three per­
centage points during the recovery of 2010–
14.14 Instead, poverty rose by 0.4 percentage
points during that period.

Notes
1. The rate of global extreme poverty, measured
as the share of the population living with under
US$1.5 per day, is 1.4 percent (2012). See
World Bank Poverty and Inequality Database.
2. Please note that poverty rates after 2010 are
not comparable to previous years due to methodological changes.
3. The small area estimation technique follows
Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw (2003) and
combines information from surveys and censuses to produce estimates of monetary poverty in small geographic areas. By applying
this technique, INEC combined information
from the 2011 Census together with the 2011
ENAHO survey to produce poverty rates at
the county level. For more information on the
2011poverty map visit INEC’s website (www​
.inec​.go.cr).
4. The multidimensional poverty measure from
INEC captures four basic conditions that are
strongly related to monetary poverty: housing,
health, education, and access to other goods
and services (purchasing power). Each condition has one or more indicators. A house­hold
is considered poor if it cannot satisfy one or
more condition.
5. Morales (2013).
6. The analysis on the movement in and out of
poverty relies on a synthetic panel estimated
using the methodology of Dang and Lanjouw
(2014). The synthetic panel results for poverty
do not completely align with the national or
international figures presented earlier, because the sample is restricted to households
whose head is between 25 and 65 years of age.

7. The long-term trends in poverty and inequality are subject to caveats regarding income
measurement due to several changes in survey methodology across that time period.
The main “breaks” in comparability of the
data series occur in 2001 and 2010. As such,
measurement of welfare across the three time
periods of 1989–2000, 2001–09, and 2010–14
is not strictly comparable. See box 2.1.
8. Inequality based on official per capita income
presents a similar trend, decreasing from
0.52 to 0.48 in 2000–2005 and increasing to
0.51 in 2009. After the global crisis, inequality increased marginally from 0.51 to 0.52 in
2010–2014. The ENIG (Encuesto Nacional de
Ingresos y Gastos) finds that income inequality remained constant with a Gini of 0.534
after adjusting for methodological differences
in the definition of income (email exchanges
with INEC’s staff http://www.inec​.go.cr/).
9. See World Bank (2014e).
10. LAC averages and comparisons cover 17 countries for which internationally comparable
data exist. See World Bank (2007) and World
Bank (2014e).
11. This elasticity is somehow larger when using
the international poverty rate.
12. Measured using a US$4 a day poverty line.
13. See World Bank (2007).
14. The decomposition follows Kolenikov and
Shorrocks (2005), who extended the standard
Datt and Ravallion (1992) decomposition to include price changes. The effect of inflation during 2007–2009 on the poverty rate is due mainly
to measurement issues (see box 2.1).

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

3. Inclusive Growth? Inequality, Jobs,
and Skills
Costa Rica’s inequality trends over the last two decades present a dilemma. The widening income
gap between the top and bottom quintiles of the population reflects changes in the labor market
and a mismatch between the patterns of growth versus the skills profile of the workforce. With
weak educational outcomes, the Costa Rican labor force is not well adapted to a labor market
that increasingly demands high skills, and unemployment has increased among the poor and lowskilled workers, particularly since the global crisis. The earnings gaps between rich and poor, and
between the skilled and unskilled, have widened. Furthermore, despite Costa Rica’s ambitious So­
cial Compact, taxes and transfers have not proven to be effective in redistributing income to com­
pensate for these disparities.

Labor Earnings and
Inequality
Rising inequality stands out as a pressing
challenge for Costa Rica, particularly in light
of its enduring commitment to a far-­reaching
Social Compact. As discussed in chapter 2,
the gap between the rich and poor has widened significantly since the global crisis. This
follows two decades of rising or stagnating inequality—in stark contrast to the significant
decline in inequality in the broader Latin
America and Caribbean (LAC) region. These
trends are particularly puzzling given Costa
Rica’s long-standing investment in an ambitious Social Compact and high social spending, as discussed in more detail in chapter 5.
Most inequality stems from differences in
earned labor incomes. In general, inequality
can come from many sources: differences in
labor earnings, pension income and other
public sector transfers, and in the returns to
capital. Throughout Latin America and the
Caribbean, changes in poverty and inequality have been mainly driven by changes in
Inclusive Growth? Inequality, Jobs, and Skills

labor incomes.1 And this has also been the
case for Costa Rica, where changes in labor
incomes have been the driving force behind
reductions and increases in poverty and inequality over the past 15 years. Specifically,
increases in labor incomes contributed to a
4.2 percentage point reduction of poverty
and a 1.0 point reduction in the Gini coefficient during the pre-crisis period of 2000–
07, but this trend was reversed during the
global crisis and changes in labor incomes
resulted in a 2.2 percentage point increase in
poverty and a one percentage point increase
in the Gini coefficient during the period
from 2007 to 2009 (­figure 3.1). Over the
post-crisis recovery period, changes in labor
incomes have contributed to a slight increase
in poverty and an additional one-point increase in the Gini coefficient (2010–14).
Moreover, most inequality derives from
differences in labor earnings in the private
sector. A decomposition of the Gini coefficient
in 2001, 2007, and 2012 reveals that labor income explained over 80 percent of overall income inequality (table 3.1).2 However, while

the labor income share decreased over the
2000s to 72 percent, this decline was entirely
explained by changes in labor incomes in the
private sector, while the share of inequality
stemming from differences in incomes from
public sector jobs remained constant over that
period. Although the contributions of non-labor income remain relatively small, the share
of inequality deriving from differences in returns to capital and pension income doubled,
from about nine percent to nearly 18 percent
over the period (table 3.1). Public sector
42

transfers (social assistance) reduced inequality
only marginally and only until 2007: they became regressive, contributing to increased inequality by 2012.3 This confirms that larger
increases in the top portions of the income
distribution (and in the public sector in particular) in the second half of the 2000s played
an important role in the increase of inequality,
which social assistance programs were not
able to counterbalance.

Fewer Jobs for Poor
and Unskilled Workers
Poor and unskilled workers are finding
limited job opportunities due to the longterm shift in Costa Rica’s pattern of growth
and the recent contraction following the
global crisis. Costa Rica’s outward-­oriented
economic development model has brought
about a significant shift in the demand for
skilled and unskilled labor. As discussed in
chapter 4, it has favored the development of
high value-added sectors, such as
Inclusive Growth? Inequality, Jobs, and Skills

electronics, medical devices, IT business
services, and so forth. In contrast, lower
value-­added sectors, such as construction,
domestic services, and agriculture have
grown more slowly—or even contracted.
The growth of low-end manufacturing (such
as textiles), construction, and agriculture
has particularly slowed since the onset of
the global crisis. Job creation has been minimal or even negative in sectors like construction, domestic services, and agri­culture,
which employ over 50 percent of low-skilled
workers (figure 3.2). At the other end of the
spectrum, sectors that employ mostly skilled
workers, such as financial services, real estate, personal services, and others, are growing fast (though from a low base in the case
of sectors such as utilities or financial services). Changing patterns in foreign direct
investment (FDI) and trade, along with

Figure 3.2
Few Jobs

Skill-­Biased Technological Change, have increased local demand for high-skilled labor
at a time when Costa Rica has a larger relative supply of low-skilled labor.4 High and
increasing labor costs, relative to other
­Central American countries, could explain
the decrease in low-skilled job creation in
lower value-added sectors, as discussed in
chapter 4.
This structural mismatch of skills and jobs
has translated into rising unemployment and
falling demand for low-skilled labor, particularly since the crisis. Overall unemployment
climbed from 4.6 percent just before the crisis
to 7.3 percent during the crisis. Even with
economic recovery post-crisis, unemployment
has steadily risen to nine percent of the workforce in 2014 (­figure 3.3). These trends reflect
a growing mismatch between the demand for
labor and the skills profile of the workforce.

As such, unemployment has hit the poor
particularly hard. The unemployment rate for
the bottom quintile in Costa Rica exceeds 20
percent, far higher than for other income groups
(figure 3.4a). By comparison, unemployment

in the top two quintiles is less than five per­

rate between the poor and non-poor is significant and increasing, reaching more than 15

­ nemployment rates in the bottom quintile
u
among other Central American countries (El
Salvador, Honduras, and Panama) are significantly lower—hovering around five percent—­
likely reflecting higher rates of informality in
their labor markets. Interestingly, higher unemployment among the poor in Costa Rica is
not associated with an increase in the share of
self-employed workers (a proxy for informal
employment).
Furthermore, over 60 percent of poor
and extreme poor adults do not generate
any labor income. There is a stark contrast
in terms of labor market activity between
the poor and the non-poor in Costa Rica.
As figure 3.5 illustrates, over 60 percent of
the working-age adults who are non-poor
are employed, while about 30 percent are
inactive and about four percent are unemployed. In contrast, among the poor and

the extreme poor, the opposite is true: 60
percent or more of working-age adults in
these groups are either inactive or unemployed. Put differently, less than 40 percent
of these adults generate any form of labor
income. Moreover, this situation has
slightly worsened since 2007, when the
share of inactive plus unemployed was
below 60 percent for the poor and slightly
above for the extreme poor.
Moreover, the labor market presents a
bleaker picture for women than for men. Female labor force participation has been historically low in Costa Rica and is among the
lowest in the LAC region. By 2013, slightly
over half (50.8 percent) of women of working age were active in the labor market, and
participation has fluctuated around 50
percent during the 2000s, increasing only
marginally. Moreover, unemployment rates

going from 6.9 percent in 2007 to 10.9 percent
in 2013. As a result, the share of working-age
women who are actually generating labor income is below 40 percent. Poor women who
are heads of household and immigrant
women have particularly high unemployment rates (box 3.1).

Box 3.1 Female Household Heads and Immigrants Face a Tough
Labor Market
In the last two decades, the Costa Rican population has seen a significant change in the
composition of households, with an important increase in the share of households headed
by women. Between 1990 and 2013, the share of households headed by women doubled
from 18 percent to 36 percent. According to some studies, this increase implied a higher
female participation in the labor market, especially among women who are low skilled
and more likely to live in poverty. Indeed, the participation of female household heads in
the labor force is much higher than the average female participation, although it is especially high among non-poor household heads (figure B3.1.1a).

unemployment rate of over twice the average for women (figure B3.1.1b). Given that these
women are more likely to have low skills, their employment opportunities are fewer, and
as a result they experience higher unemployment.
Immigrant women have even higher unemployment rates. Immigrants, particularly from
Nicaragua, represent a large share of the labor force in Costa Rica, in particular in lowskilled employment. As shown in figure B3.1.2, women born in Nicaragua and other
Central American countries have an unemployment rate around twice the average for
women, whereas for men the rate is below average.

to ensure opportunities for the poor. Educational outcomes are surprisingly weak, given
the level of spending and development. Like
many middle-income countries, Costa Rica
is finding that achieving basic levels of education, such as near universal literacy and
completion of primary school, is not enough
to generate the skills needed to sustain the
demands of its evolving economy—or to
promote inclusive opportunities for the poor

and bottom 40 percent of the population.
Given the country’s level of development and
high spending, its education system seriously
underperforms in terms of retention (as evidenced by high school dropout rates) and
quality (as demonstrated by weak test results).
Moreover, disparities in education out­comes
are large, putting the poor and bottom 40
percent at a significant disadvantage for
learning and earning.

Low educational attainment:
overall and for the poor

Despite large public investment and important achievements, average school attainment is still low in Costa Rica. The growing
investment in education in the country has
brought important gains in terms of literacy
and primary school completion. By 2011,
the literacy rate for adults 15 years old and
above had reached 97 percent, and the share
of adults 25 years and above who had no formal education went from 21 percent in 1950
to three percent in 2010. By 2010, 83 percent
of adults had achieved at least a complete
primary education (­figure 3.6a). However,
the average level of education today is below
what would be expected given Costa Rica’s
GDP per capita and education spending. Indeed, today, fewer than half of young adults
18–29 years old—and less than 40 percent of
the overall workforce—have completed secondary education (figure 3.6b).
Indeed, compared with other countries,
dropout rates are quite high in Costa Rica.

Less than half of the cohort 25–29 years old
had achieved a secondary or higher education by 2010, further adding to the stock of
low-skilled adult workers, a legacy of the
1980s crisis. Costa Rica’s educational attainment is lower than in peer countries in LAC
(such as Chile and Panama), and significantly
lower than in peer countries in Europe (such
as Croatia and Lithuania), and far lower than
graduation rates in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) (figure 3.7).
Inequities in educational attainment are
closely related to poverty. Figure 3.8a shows
gross attendance rates by quintile for primary
and secondary. Attendance in primary is
higher at lower levels of income, which is
positive in the sense that it is very high for
all children, even the poorest. However,
­figure 3.8b shows that the share of children
who are over-age (that is, who are a year or
more older than the correct age for their
grade) is higher for children in poorer quintiles. Taken together, these statistics suggest

that even though enrollment is high among
poor children, repetition rates are also high,
and therefore the quality of their learn­ing
might be lower and their incentives to drop
out after completing primary may be higher.
Consistent with that story, we observe that
Inclusive Growth? Inequality, Jobs, and Skills

enrollment rates in secondary are significantly higher for children in richer quintiles.
There are large disparities in enrollment in day care and preschool, but these
even out by the time children enter primary school. As ­f igure 3.9a shows, by age
49

four about 60 percent of children from
households with educated parents are attending a day-care center, as compared
with 40 percent for children in households
with medium education attainment, and
about 20 percent for children from households with low education.5 Attendance in
preschool is also higher for children from
wealthier families: virtually all five to six
year olds from the top quintile of the population attend preschool, as compared with
79 percent of those in families in the poorest quintile.6 Enrollment equalizes by the
time children start first grade, and it remains close to 100 percent for all children
throughout primary, reflecting Costa Rica’s
long-standing guarantee of basic public
education.
The transition from primary to secondary school is particularly prone to high drop­
out rates, especially among children from
households with weaker parental education.

At around age 12, some children begin to
drop out, and those from households with a
low “educational environment” (that is, children whose parents have low education)
have a much faster dropout rate than children from more educated households (figure
3.9b). In fact, a recent study of the factors
behind human capital accumulation finds
that, although context variables, such as
place of residence, explained a significant
share of the educational attainment inequality in the 1990s, at present only household
and individual level variables, such as parental education, explain such outcomes.7 Income status also affects enrollment, with
only 77 percent of teens aged 13 to 17 from
households in the poorest quintile attending
school as compared with 93 percent of those
from households in the richest quintile.8
Dropouts are highest in seventh grade,
just after the completion of primary education. For many children, this is linked to

Knowledge gap 3.1 Why Are So Many Kids Dropping Out of School in
Costa Rica?
The skill-biased development that Costa Rica has experienced has raised returns to
education, particularly secondary and tertiary. Given a large secondary school network in
the country and universal primary completion, it is therefore surprising that more than
half of the children who finish primary fail to complete secondary education. Although
some general factors are known (see figure K3.1.1), such as lack of motivation, distance
(in rural areas), and gender bias, the specific factors that push children out of school are
still unknown, as are the critical ages at which early signs of dropout can be detected.

attainment of adults 15 years and older is up
to twice as high in the Central Region (dark
green in the map) as in the peripheral districts around it (dark red districts). A ranking of all districts in Costa Rica according to
the share of adults 17–21 who have completed secondary education shows that there
is a 42-percentage point gap between the
completion rate for the bottom and the top
20 percent of districts in terms of completion
(26.3 percent against 68.2 percent). A similar
gap is seen in terms of net upper secondary
enrollment (­figure 3.10b) across districts, although the gap has been closing in recent
years, as low-­performing districts have increased their enrollment rates faster than
high-performing ones.9 Notice, however, that
even in the best-­performing districts net

Poor quality of education

The quality of education in Costa Rica is also
very low, given its level of spending. At the
primary school level, the latest results from
the TERCE examination of Latin American
students by UNESCO show that Costa Rica is
the only country in the sample where students in both third and sixth grades performed worse in TERCE (2013) than they
did in SERCE (2006) in reading and in mathematics.10 Similarly, the performance of Costa
Rican students at the secondary school level
is also weak. Speci­fically, the performance of
15-year-old students on the international
PISA mathematics exam is far lower than

would be predicted by Costa Rica’s spending
on secondary education (figure 3.11).11 Moreover, since these tests are taken only by those
who remain in school by age 15, and since
dropout rates are so high in Costa Rica, the
average skill levels and learning outcomes of
all 15 year olds (including those in and outside school) are likely even lower.
Moreover, there are large disparities in
learning outcomes by socioeconomic status. UNESCO’s SERCE study also shows
that ­children from higher socioeconomic
backgrounds obtain better scores than
their peers from lower socioeconomic
backgrounds (­figure 3.12).12

Wages are relatively high across the

As discussed in chapter 4, Costa Rica has relatively high wages compared to Central
American neighbors, in both agriculture and
low-­tech industry (light manufacturing)—
two sectors that traditionally employ lowskilled workers. Surprisingly, neither rising
rates of unemployment nor the continuous
influx of low-skilled migrant workers from

Knowledge gap 3.2 Are Reservation Wages High in Costa Rica?
The increase in unemployment rates, especially among poor workers, and the marginal
changes in self-employment, a proxy for informal employment, is a puzzling finding. Most
LAC countries respond to a decrease of jobs in the formal sector with a surge in informal
employment, in the absence of a safety net that enables workers to look for other formal jobs.
In Costa Rica, however, this did not happen, even if there is no clear evidence that the social
safety net provides sufficient income support to those who are unemployed. Thus, the question arises of how high reservation wages are in Costa Rica, in a context of high average wages
and a high cost of living relative to other countries in the region.a
a. For evidence on the cost of living in Costa Rica by international standards, see Programa Estado de la Nacion (2014).

Nicaragua (box 3.2) have put down­ward
pressure on low-skilled wages. Moreover, the
minimum wage does not appear to be driving artificially high low-skilled wages. Minimum wages are binding for most Costa Rican
54

workers in formal salaried jobs, especially in
low-skilled jobs.13 And while changes in minimum wages over the 1980s–1990s did result
in a small reduction in employment, this effect was minor, and there were no effects on
Inclusive Growth? Inequality, Jobs, and Skills

Box 3.2 Nicaraguan Workers in Costa Rica Do Not Appear to Drive
Down Native Workers’ Wages
Immigrants, particularly from Nicaragua, represent a large share of the labor force in
Costa Rica, in particular in low-skilled employment. In 2013, over 10 percent of those
employed in Costa Rica were foreign-born, of which eight percent were Nicaraguan.
Nicaraguan immigrants in Costa Rica are largely unskilled: less than 20 percent completed secondary school while over a third (35 percent) did not complete primary
school.a However, Costa Ricans also have low schooling on average—in fact, 46 percent
of both Nicaraguan and native-born adults finished primary school but did not complete
secondary. This significant overlap in educational attainment suggests the potential for
competition between these two groups for low- or unskilled jobs. This can be particularly
true in specific sectors and specific parts of the country due to the non-random dispersion patterns of immigrants. Four sectors of employment—agriculture, domestic service,
commerce and hotels/restaurants, and construction—account for 75 percent of lowskilled immigrant employment in 2013. For context, these same four sectors accounted
for only 59 percent of low-skilled native-born employment. In some parts of the country,
foreign-born workers account for significant shares of workers in these four sectors,
including over 20 percent of all workers in domestic services and construction in Huetar
Norte and the Central regions.
The presence of immigrant workers has little bearing on the wages of low-skilled Costa
Rican workers—and is actually correlated with higher wages among higher-skilled Costa
Ricans. Exploiting the sectoral and geographical differences in immigrant employment in
Costa Rica, log wage regressions reveal positive correlations between native wages and the
proportion of ­foreign-born workers in the same employment category as natives, where
the employment category is defined at the region and sector level. This suggests positive
complementarities between immigrant labor and skilled native labor. This is a sizeable
relationship, with native workers who completed secondary receiving a wage premium of
22 percent at the average share of immigrants for this group (8.3 percent).b At the same
time, no statistically significant relationship is evident between unskilled native workers
and immigrants—suggesting that wages of native workers are not being lowered by
immigrant labor. Similar analysis found no evidence of increased unemployment among
native labor in regions with more immigrants.

a. These education rates are calculated for the adult population 20 and above using the 2011 Costa Rica Census.
b. Note that this is not necessarily a causal relationship—for example, it could be that immigrant workers are more likely to migrate
to higher-paying regions and/or work in higher-wage sectors resulting in a higher share of immigrant workers in these higher-paying
sectors.

wages or employment in the uncovered sectors (self-­employment). More recently,
changes in the minimum wage have been
very modest, mostly correcting for inflation,
and the evolution of the real minimum wage
has closely tracked the evolution of labor
productivity (figure 3.13). Moreover, a study
of the increase in the enforcement of minimum wage policy shows that it had a small
positive effect on wages, especially where the
minimum wage is most binding (at lower levels), but it did not affect employment in any
segment of the ­distribution.14 Rather, it appears that high income levels, coupled with
generous social benefits, have resulted in
high reservation wages across the board in
Costa Rica.
Despite relatively high wages even for
low-skilled workers, the earnings gap between rich and poor workers is widening.

Even though earnings have grown in real
terms for low-skilled workers, they have
fallen in relative terms to high-skilled workers. As figure 3.14 shows, relative to the median earnings level, between 2007 and 2013
workers in the top quintile increased the
ratio of their earnings to the median earner
by 0.19 (from 2 to 2.19). At the same time,
workers in the bottom quintile decreased
the ratio of earnings to the median by 0.23
(from 0.52 to 0.29), while workers in the
second to fourth quintile kept the ratios to
the median almost flat. A similar picture is
seen when income groups are divided according to workers’ education. For workers
with tertiary education, the ratio to the median income increased from 1.89 to 2.01 between 2007 and 2013, for workers with
secondary complete and secondary incomplete it remained flat, and for workers with

primary or less the ratio fell from 0.79 to
0.73 of the median income. This resulted
in a widening of the gap between the highest-paid and the lowest-paid workers,
which is at the root of the increase in inequality that occurred in the second half of
the 2000s.
Indeed, the incomes of the poorest and
those with the lowest skills grew faster before the crisis—and fell the most since the
crisis. ­figure 3.15 plots the evolution

of incomes for individuals in the poorest
income decile (­figure 3.15a) and the richest
decile (­figure 3.15b), divided according to
the educational attainment (skills level) of

clearly that before 2007, the incomes of individuals in the poorest decile, whose head
of household had fewer than eight years of
education, grew faster than the incomes of
those individuals (also in the poorest
decile) whose household head had more

education. Moreover the incomes in the
poorest decile also grew much faster than
the incomes of individuals in the richest
decile, which actually fell between 2001 and
2007. In contrast, starting in 2008 low incomes begin to decline, and high incomes
begin to rise, which becomes more apparent after 2010.15 Interestingly, educational
gaps appear to matter more at the bottom
of the distribution before 2007, suggesting
that income increases were the highest
among the ­lowest-skilled and poorest workers in the pre-crisis period.

Redistribution Has Not
Offset Rising Inequality
Finally, redistributive policies have
not been effective in compensating for inequities associated with labor earnings and
skills. Redistribution policies have had a
modest effect on overall inequality. The
challenges facing Costa Rica and other
LAC countries for reducing poverty in the
future highlight the importance of ensuring that fiscal policy has a strong equity
focus and redistributes the gains from
growth among those who are less well off.16
The Commitment to Equity Project (CEQ),
a joint initiative of Tulane University and
the Inter-American Dialogue, has developed a harmonized methodology to assess
the distributional impact of taxation and
public expenditure throughout Latin
America.17 Figure 3.16a shows the gradual
impact of fiscal policy in six LAC countries
including Costa Rica. Fiscal policy is decomposed into direct taxes (such as income and payroll taxes); direct transfers
(such as non-­contributory pensions, and

Inclusive Growth? Inequality, Jobs, and Skills

conditional and unconditional cash transfers); and indirect taxes and transfers (such
as value added taxes, and fuel subsidies).18
In Costa Rica, direct and indirect transfers
and taxes decrease income inequality by
three Gini points, from 0.51 to 0.49, a reduction comparable to Brazil, Mexico, and
Uruguay, and larger than the reduction in
Bolivia and Peru. The evidence available
for these six countries suggests that fiscal
policy in LAC is not able to counterbalance
the inequality pressures from labor
income.
On the other hand, the experience from
OECD countries shows that redistributive
policy has the potential to reduce inequality. As figure 3.16b shows, non-LAC OECD
and select LAC countries, including Costa
Rica, have similar levels of market income
inequality before any fiscal intervention.
The Gini coefficient hovers around 0.4 and
0.5 for all these countries. However, there
are significant differences in the impact of
transfers (direct taxes on income, payroll
taxes, and direct transfers) between the
LAC group and the OECD. The Gini that
results after taking into account direct taxes
and transfers in the OECD group is somewhere around 0.3, while it remains almost
unchanged at around 0.5 in Costa Rica and
the rest of the LAC group. According to
World Bank (2014e), the low tax revenue
and high reliance on indirect taxation in
LAC are important reasons for these differences. This is also the case of Costa Rica. If
compared with non-LAC OECD countries,
fiscal revenues are low and rely heavily on
indirect taxes, which are neutral in relative
terms and therefore tend to reduce the progressivity of the overall tax system.19

payroll taxes to Market Income. Disposable Income is Net Market Income plus direct transfers. Post-Fiscal Income adds indirect subsidies
and subtracts taxes from disposable income. Final Income is Post-Fiscal Income plus in-kind public transfers on health and education

4. The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and
Its Constraints
Costa Rica’s small and open economy has achieved solid growth with an outward-oriented model
combined with macroeconomic and political stability. This model has encouraged export diversifi­
cation towards higher value-added sectors and increasing labor productivity. However, the economy
is showing signs of built-up vulnerabilities, resulting in weak job creation and loss of competitive­
ness. How can Costa Rica achieve higher levels of growth? Evidence points to three priority areas:
education & skills, infrastructure, and government effectiveness and regulatory quality.

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

More broadly, GDP per capita did not
make much headway in convergence with
the United States (figure 4.3). GDP per
­capita grew by 83 percent to US$ 5,839
(constant, 2005 prices)—higher than the
average of countries in LAC (48 percent)
and the world (35.5 percent). In terms of
Latin American per capita income ranking,
Costa Rica is the seventh richest country
of the region (in 2005 constant US$), just

Costa Rica experienced solid economic
growth in the past 25 years, as compared to
Latin America and the Caribbean but not
with other countries. Its real growth averaged
4.7 percent since 1990, above the Latin
­America average of 3.1 percent (figure 4.1).
During 2003–2007, Costa Rica’s GDP growth
was particularly strong at 6.7 percent on average, well above the regional average for Latin
America of 4.6 percent. During the crisis,
growth slowed to 1.2 percent in 2008 and
contracted by one percent in 2009. Following
the global crisis, Costa Rica recovered similarly to a set of peer comparator countries
(Chile, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Lithuania, Panama, and Uruguay) (figure 4.2). However, this recovery has been slower than that
of upper-middle­-income countries or comparator countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC). Growth decelerated in
2013 to 3.5 percent and remained stable in
2014. The outlook is that growth will not accelerate in 2015, amid ­deteriorating fiscal bal­
ances and a rising public debt-GDP ratio, but
it is expected to pick up afterwards. The recent
closure of Intel’s microchip factory is expected
to dampen growth by about one-half to three-­
quarters percentage points in 2014–15.1

has displayed low volatility in international
comparisons during 2000–2013 (figure 4.4).

Growth Analysis and
Trends
When examining growth by factor of
production, the contribution of capital has
been relatively stable in the past two decades.
However, the mid-2000s saw a sharp decline
in the contribution of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Between 2000 and 2004, TFP
declined strongly and even turned negative,
dragging overall growth by about 1.7 percentage points a year (down from the positive
contribution to growth of about 0.9 percentage points a year over the 1995–1999 period).
TFP recovered over the 2005–2009 period,
but employment growth declines resulted in
a sizeable reduction in labor’s contribution
to output growth from about 3.2 percentage
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

points a year to 1.9 percentage points (figure
4.5). Over the 2010–2014, the contribution
of labor further declined to 1.1 percentage
points. Although growth accounting is a descriptive methodology and, by definition,
does not provide specific insights into the
factors that underlie TFP growth, economists
have consistently relied on measures of the
growth “residual” TFP as a gauge of a country’s technological change and innovation.
In this light, TFP growth reflects a reallocation of inputs to the sector of the economy
with higher productivity gains. Moreover,
this is consistent with observed increases in
labor productivity, measured as output per
worker (figure 3.13 in chapter 3 and figure 4.6).
Weakened investment and net exports
have dragged growth in recent years. In
the mid-2000s, the external sector had a positive contribution to growth from an
­aggregate demand perspective, as exports
outweighed imports (figure 4.7). With the

global crisis, however, exports declined
sharply without an accompanying strong decline in imports. Softer economic growth in
the United States (Costa Rica’s main trading
partner) as well as in China have weakened
demand, and the recent closure of Intel’s microchip factory in 2014 has further reduced
exports. Intel’s electronics exports alone accounted for 20 percent of merchan­dise exports.2 The lost dynamism in exports has been
exacerbated by rising imports outside free
trade zones (FTZs). The contribution of investment has also declined, lowering overall
GDP growth.
The service sector continues to sustain
growth. It has accounted for more than 60
percent of GDP growth (about 2.7 percentage points of growth per year) before and
after the global crisis (figure 4.8). Economic
growth has been particularly strong in the
telecommunications and tourism sectors.
The telecom liberalization has brought a

renewed dynamism to the economy due to
new investments and expansion in the provision of services.3 The tourism sector also
showed healthy growth of eight percent a
year in both 2013 and 2014, though its contribution to overall GDP remains small (accounting for about 4.6 ­percent of GDP).
However, manufacturing, agriculture,
and construction have reduced their contribution to GDP growth. The manufacturing
sector has experienced a loss of competitiveness due to exchange rate appreciation,
growing wages for low-skilled workers, and
rising electricity prices. The construction
sector, which experienced a boom in the
2000s, has not returned to pre-­crisis levels.
The data on new construction permits (excluding infrastructure and all public construction) shows that during the boom years
the construction sector doubled the number of permits from 2.2 to 4 million of
square meters per year; but, after adjusting

Knowledge gap 4.1 Is the Contraction of Employment in the
Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Construction Sectors Cyclical or
Structural?
Costa Rica has seen a significant contraction in employment in the construction, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors. Cyclical patterns could be the culprits as the pattern
emerged during the global crisis for all three sectors, compounded by the Roya coffee rust
fungus and weather factors in agriculture. However, the contraction in jobs has persisted,
which is particularly worrisome given that these sectors employ a higher share of the poor
and lower-skilled workers—and given the sustained rise in unemployment. What are the
structural factors in these sectors that are causing this sustained contraction?
abruptly in 2009, the number of new permits has contracted in the last two years.
Amounting to about five percent of GDP,
the construction sector is relatively underdeveloped in Costa Rica when compared to
Panama (10 percent) or Uruguay (eight
percent)). This underdevelopment is partly
attributed to weakened public infrastructure spending, which has been constrained
by the limited fiscal space and anemic implementation of projects, and lower credit
growth. Agriculture output also stagnated
due to weather factors and the spread of the
Roya fungus (“coffee rust”).4 As a share of
GDP, agriculture accounts for five percent
of GDP, though it generates 12 percent of
jobs. Agriculture is an important source of
jobs for the bottom 40 percent of the population (18 percent) and the extreme poor
(22 percent). Agricultural products, mainly
coffee, pineapples, and bananas, account for
25 percent of exports.
The slowdown in economic activity after
the global crisis has translated into weaker
job creation. As discussed in chapter 3, the
unemployment rate stood at nine percent
in 2014, which was relatively high by Costa
Rican historical standards (figure 3.3). In the
68

past three years, the economy has been adding around 10,000 jobs per year, which is
lower than the usual average annual increase
in the labor force of about 38,000. The underperformance of the construction and agriculture sectors is particularly worrisome
considering that they employ a higher share
of low-skilled workers (­figure 4.9). Another
explanation for weaker job creation is that
new firms, which tend to create more jobs,
are not appearing in sufficiently high numbers following the global crisis (figure 4.10).

Policies Explaining
Growth
Macroeconomic stability

One of the reasons behind growth performance is that the country has made efforts
to maintain reasonable macroeconomic stability. Costa Rica learned the importance of
macroeconomic stability the hard way: during the Latin American crisis of the early
1980s it suffered a cumulative per-capita income loss of nearly 20 percent. Following
that crisis, a new government started a series of structural reforms and committed to

pursuing macroeconomic stabilization.5
Those policies proved successful in achieving a high and sustainable rate of growth averaging nearly five percent per annum in
1983–2006. The fiscal deficit was virtually
eliminated at the end of that period, and
public debt was reduced by two thirds, of
which less than 20 percent was from external sources. The decline of the debt burden
was due in part to the Ministry of Finance
initiatives relating to the creation of a consolidated cash management office and the
implementation of a debt management strategy. Monetary and exchange rate policies
have evolved from a crawling peg policy to
exchange rate band (2006) to abandonment
of the pre-defined bands (2015). Inflation
has dropped to single digits since 2009.
Until the global crisis, Costa Rica’s GDP
had not ­contracted in 25 years.

Trade liberalization, FDI, and
structural transformation

Moreover, outward-oriented policies have
played a key role in fostering trade. Trade liberalization has been nurtured through various
actions and dates back to 1963, when Costa
Rica joined the Central American Common
Market (CACM, made up of El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua). Joining the CACM required the elimination of
trade barriers among member countries and
fueled an increase of manufacturing exports
to the CACM. A second milestone took place
20 years later (1983), when Costa Rica joined
the Caribbean Basin Initiative, strengthening
its trade relations with the United States.6 Like
other Central American countries, Costa Rica
began to reduce tariffs unilaterally in the mid1980s, with trade tariffs declining from 53
percent in 1985 to about 5.2 percent in 2004
70

and falling further since then. But perhaps the
most significant step was joining CAFTA-DR,
after an intense national debate that required
a referendum for its ratification. 7 CAFTA-DR
provided a more stable and reliable framework for Costa Rica’s trade with its main trading partner, the United States, introduced
changes to the legal framework to promote
transparency, ensured a secure and predictable environment for investors, and led to the
breakdown of government monopolies in the
telecom and insurance sectors.8 Following
CAFTA-DR, Costa Rica has entered into further trade agreements with Canada, China,
the European Union, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore, consolidating its open-economy
agenda. Exports now represent around 55
percent of GDP, compared to around 27 percent in 1980. The openness of the economy
(measured by the ratio of exports plus imports to GDP) increased to 100 percent of
GDP from 65 percent during the same period.
An explicit policy to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) complemented trade
liberalization efforts. Trade agreements,
through provisions governing investment,
reduce the risk of expropriation and ensure
against the discrimination of foreign firms.
The passage of the Free Trade Zones law in
1981 (amended in 1990 and 2010), which
was adopted to promote the export of non-​
traditional products, has contributed to
­attract FDI into Costa Rica.9 Free Trade
Zones accounted for 51 percent of merchandise exports in 2014, compared to 21
­percent in 1997. Whereas Costa Rica’s investment attraction efforts in the 1980s focused on lower value-­added sectors such as
textiles, since the mid-1990s it has shifted to
attracting FDI with high value-added sectors, especially electronics and advanced
manufacturing, medical devices and life
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

sciences, and ICT-related services. The
coun­try received US$407 million (three
percent of GDP) in FDI inflows in 1997,
and this grew to US$2.7 billion by 2013 (5.4
percent of GDP). FDI decreased by about
1.2 percentage point of GDP, reaching 4.2
percent of GDP in 2014, partly affected by
the exit of Intel and Bank of America (figure
4.11a). Nevertheless, Costa Rica is one of
the world’s most FDI-intensive economies,
with its FDI-to-GDP ratio exceeding international levels from 1985 through 2010.10
The composition of FDI has shifted towards
services, which accounted for 8.3 percent of
total FDI inflows in 2002–05, but increased
to 28 percent in 2010–14, partly attributed
to the liberalization of the telecom and insurance sectors (figure 4.11b). In 2014,
Costa Rica attracted US$474.4 million of
new investments across 39 projects that created 10,281 jobs, offsetting the 4,343 jobs
lost due to the exit or downsizing of some
foreign firms.11
A successful institutional cluster has been
effective in supporting trade and FDI. In the
context of Productive Development Policies
(PDPs) that Costa Rica has put in place since
the 1970s, one success story is the PDP to attract FDI and promote exports. In this task
there are three main actors: the Costa Rican
Investment Promotion Agency (CINDE),
PROCOMER (Promotora del Comercio Exte­
rior de Costa Rica), and the Ministerio de
Comercio Exterior (COMEX). All three work
in tandem to bring foreign direct investment
to Costa Rica and promote exports. Collaboration between CINDE and high levels of
government, including the president, successfully brought Intel to Costa Rica in 1996 (box
4.1). By streamlining processes and facilitating the removal of bottlenecks for multinational companies in the FTZs, these agencies
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

were able to contribute to the development of
high-tech manufacturing and the country’s
status as an attractive FDI location.
Trade liberalization and FDI have made
Costa Rica stand out for its vibrant high-tech
and ICT sectors. Agricultural production
now accounts for a little over five percent of
GDP, compared to 13 percent in the early
1980s. Moreover, the service sector’s share of
GDP has increased, becoming the main sector of the economy. The share of the manufacturing sector in GDP has stagnated at
about 22 ­percent in the past 25 years. At the
same time, the employment share of manufacturing decreased from 25 percent to 12
percent.12 As a result of attracting FDI in
high-technology sectors, Costa Rica’s share
of high-tech manufacturing and ICT exports
is among the highest among upper-middle-income countries and Latin America
(figure 4.12). These trends suggest a fast
transformation of the economy into sectors
in which Costa Rica had a competitive
advantage.
The economy contributes to a number
of global value chains and has been able to
upgrade its product mix over time. Some
examples are electronics, medical devices,
auto­motive, aeronautic/aerospace, film/
broad­casting devices, and offshore services.13 During the 1990s the profile of new
companies shifted from a focus on electrical assembly to electronics. The product
mix for medical devices is complex and sophisticated, including products in the areas
of optics, dental, cardiovascular, and breast
implants. Over time, many firms operating
in the medical device cluster have vertically
integrated, received raw materials, and
­performed different activities in the value
chain (sustaining engineering, process development) (figure 4.13). In the case of

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

Box 4.1

Intel and Development of the High-Tech Sector in Costa Rica

In 1996, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, announced plans for the
establishment of its US$300 million semiconductor assembly and test plant in Costa
Rica. The country’s economic and political stability, its proximity to the United States,
and its pro-business environment were all important. Some bottlenecks in Costa Rica’s
investment climate raised some concerns, however, such as inadequate supply of skilled
labor, infrastructure and logistics (airport upgrades), tax incentives, and improvements
in permits and construction processes.a The country’s tertiary educational system was
strengthened with the introduction of a series of programs to increase both the
number of graduates with engineering and technical degrees and the proficiency of the
graduates.b The stock of graduates from engineering programs in Costa Rica reportedly
increased by almost 40 percent between 2002 and 2011.c CINDE also worked with
existing investors to “back link” potential suppliers—both local, through the Costa
Rica PROVEE program, and foreign—of products and services that transcended
sectors, identifying commonalities between medical devices and electronics in their
procurement of clean room services, plastics, and metal mechanics.d
Intel contributed to the development of the high-tech sector through three channels: (i) it
had a direct impact on employment, investment, trade, output, and the development of
the technology cluster; (ii) it served as a catalyst for repositioning Costa Rica as an attractive investment location, through its impact on the country’s technical education, incentives laws and regulations, and infrastructure;e and (iii) it increased the confidence of
foreign investors through the demonstration effect. Intel’s decision to invest in Costa Rica
gave a “signaling effect” that helped solidify the country’s emergence as an attractive destination for FDI in high-tech manufacturing. Companies that followed Intel in establishing
manufacturing and global service operations in Costa Rica included Abbott Laboratories
(now Hospira), Procter & Gamble (P&G), and Hewlett Packard.
In April 2014, Intel announced its decision to close its Costa Rican microchip assembly factory and move its assembly operations to China, Malaysia, and Vietnam. While all microchip assembly operations will move to Asia, Intel will keep its engineering and design
departments and its global service center in Costa Rica, a move that showcases Costa Rica’s
competitiveness in high value-­added segments. It is unclear what the repercussions will be
of Intel’s decision to leave because Costa Rica’s high-tech exports have become increasingly
diversified. As it has in the past, Costa Rica will need to strategically position itself and capitalize on its strengths to continue to attract FDI and increase job creation.

aeronautics, firms are focusing on higher-­
value service activities—such as software
and design and engineering—and their
product mix has upgraded as well.14
Not only have exports tilted towards
higher value-added sectors but they have
also become more diversified, minimizing
74

exposure to weather or other shocks. With
its integration into the global value chain of
medical devices, the country has been able
to survive the phasing out of Intel’s manufacturing plant. Exports of medical devices
have grown at an average annual rate of 12
percent in the last decade (from US$0.55
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

billion in 2004 to US$1.9 billion in 2014),
while electronics grew at four percent per
year on average. The product mix in the
medical device cluster is complex and sophisticated, including products in the areas
of optics, dental, cardiovascular, and breast
implants. With its increas­ingly diversified
agricultural portfolio (bananas, pineapples,
coffee, and agroindustry), agricultural exports have been shielded from wide swings
due to weather and diseases (figure 4.14a).
Business services (mainly ICT related) account for almost half of all service exports.
Leading activities in this sector also include design and engineering, professional

services, shared service centers (for example, back-office services for one company,
including accounting, finance, procurement,
and human resources), business ­process
outsourcing (to a lesser extent), architecture, and digital animation (figure 4.14b).
However, backward linkages from multinational corporations (MNCs) to local
companies remain weak. On average, local
suppliers provide only 24 percent of inputs
to MNCs in Costa Rica.15 Other studies cite
that this percentage is even lower, at one
percent of MNCs’ inputs. Less than 20
­percent of inputs sourced locally were incorporated in MNCs’ exports, indicating

that the inputs are likely of low value and
not central to the value chain.16 Locally
sourced products are largely low valued-­
added products and services such as packaging, printing materials, and services (for
instance, cleaning and security).17 However,
there is tangible demand for increased
local sourcing by MNCs. Of the MNCs interviewed by the World Bank in 2014, 93
percent declared an interest in local procurement, and 40 percent claimed to have
a supplier development program already in
place. Local firms face difficulties in complying with MNCs’ requirements, such as
quality standards, delivery times, or upgrading of technical capabilities. Moreover,
local small and medium enterprises may be
deterred from seeking business with MNCs
due to the uncertainty around the process
of upgrading their operations.18 The government’s programs to support backward
linkages have had some tangible results, although these are quite small. The programs
have insufficient scale and scope to significantly influence the development of productive linkages between domestic SMEs
and MNCs.19
Although backward linkages may be
small, the presence of MNCs has had positive spillovers through knowledge transfers.
One venue for these knowledge spillovers is
through labor movement from MNCs to
local companies. A recent study for Costa
Rica finds a positive spillover generated by
the movement of workers from MNCs to
local firms. Former workers of MNCs create
new firms with lower mortality rates or
boost firm performance for their new local
employer.20 By inducing skill upgrades and
changes in education programs, the presence of MNCs have also benefit local firms
(box 4.1).
76

Capitalizing on protected areas

Costa Rica has successfully capitalized
on its environmental policies and Green
Trademark, by embracing and developing
a sustainable tourism industry.21 In 2013,
close to 2.5 million tourists visited the
country. This implies that the number of
visitors per capita (at around 0.5) is above
popular destinations in the Caribbean
basin such as Mexico (0.2) or the Dominican Republic (0.38). While sun-and-beach
tourism clearly is part of Costa Rica’s attractions, eco-­tourism (an area where it has
been a ­pioneer) is also very popular, with
many travelers visiting the national parks
and protected areas. Moreover, the country
ranked sixth in the region and 47th overall
according to the 2013 Travel and Tourism
Competitive Index compiled annually by
the World Economic Forum to measure the
factors that make a destination attractive
for the travel and tourism industry. Costa
Rica’s large and mature ecotourism industry has earned it a reputation as a top
­ecotourism destination in the world. The
tourism industry is one of Costa Rica’s
main sources of foreign exchange (14.2
percent of total exports in 2013); its direct
share in GDP was 4.6 percent in 2013 (the
indirect share was 12.1 percent), and it
contributed directly 4.6 percent of total
employment (indirectly, it contributed 11.5
percent).22 The tourism sector comprises a
diverse set of operators (hotels, airlines,
transportation companies, restaurants, etc.)
that work together. Costa Rica’s main attributes for tourists are its beautiful national parks, pleasant climate, and social
and economic achievements.23 Although its
infrastructure has deficiencies, it has been
able to sustain the accelerated growth of
the industry since the 1980s. Currently, a
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

sector-wide traveler tax is used for international promotion of the Costa Rican “brand,”
which prevents free riding and ensures that
marketing for the country is well funded.
The tourism sector is well organized, with
a strong public-private collaboration where
incentives are aligned. The sector is organized around two umbrella organizations:
the Costa Rican Chamber of Hotels (CCH),
a very influential organization regrouping
the largest hotel chains (and several smaller
hotels), and the National Chamber of Tourism (CANATUR), where tourism-related
businesses are represented (travel agencies,
hotels, restaurants, etc.). The Costa Rican
­Institute for Tourism (CR-ICT) is the autonomous public institution in charge of setting
tourism policy. The board of directors of the
CR-ICT has a good balance of political appointees and representatives of the industry,
and the CEO of CR-ICT often comes from
the tourism private sector. Over time CRICT has adopted the role of promoter of private sector development, coordinator of
sectoral dialogue, and administrator of tourism development incentives.24 Key elements
in the successful relationship between these
three bodies are their strong complementarity, the consultative approach to developing
policy (there is a continuous dialogue between the private and public sector), and the
alignment of incentives (to maintain the
Green Trademark).

Competitiveness
Challenges
Increasing production costs
weaken Costa Rica’s competitiveness. For
many years, the attraction of strategic foreign investment relied on the country’s
unique combination of location close to
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

large markets, educated labor force, and political stability.25 According to the latest
Global Com­pet­itiveness report, the country
scored well for health and primary education, higher education and training, technology readiness, and innovation potential,
and this contributed to Costa Rica’s being
ranked as the third most competitive economy in Latin America, behind Panama and
Chile. However, other countries in the region and beyond have caught up in terms of
stability and education of their labor force.
In contrast, Costa Rica’s education system
has not adapted to provide the skills needed
for the changing economy. Private firms
perceived that rising costs are affecting their
operations (41 ­percent), with ones in the agricultural (62 percent) and manufacturing
(50 percent) being the most affected.26 The
cited factors for rising production costs are
electricity (24 percent), fuel prices (17 percent), and salaries (13 percent).
Competitiveness pressures are not new:
private firms have reported these investment climate obstacles for many years. The
World Economic Forum, which carries out
yearly surveys to construct its index of
global competitiveness, has asked business
executives to identify the most problematic
factors for doing business. For Costa Rica
in 2014, the top five areas were inefficient
government bureaucracy (27 percent), inadequate supply of infrastructure (24 percent), access to financing (11 ­percent),
corruption (eight percent), and restrictive
labor regulations (eight percent). These
areas are very similar to the ones identified
seven years ago.27 The World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES) also provides data
on the perception of the private sector on
growth. In 2010, the latest survey, the top
five problem areas were access to finance
77

(26 percent), practices of informal sector
(23 percent), inadequately educated workforce (13 percent), business licenses and
permits (nine percent), and labor regulations (five percent).
These investment climate constraints do
have a harmful effect on firms’ productivity. Using objective indicators of investment climate constraints, Fajnzylber et al.
(2009) find that improvements in regulatory compliance would have the most beneficial ­impact on the productivity of Costa
Rican firms.28 With an expected contribution ranging from 61 to 72 percent depending on the benchmark selected, the regu­​
latory compliance captures the effect of
regulation and institutional quality and is
proxied by sales declared for tax purposes
and external audits. Governance indicators,
proxied by bribes, crime losses, and security costs, rank second, contributing between 19 to 22 ­percent of the productivity
increase. Infrastructure quality, which is
proxied in this analysis by firms’ losses
caused by electricity outages, explains between one and 10 percent of the productivity increase.
Moreover, these constraints affect overall
growth rates. Cross-country growth regressions have been used to identify statistically
and economically significant determinants of
growth rates. While these regressions are not
without their limitations,29 they provide useful
information on counterfactual estimates on
the potential impact on growth due to improve­
ment of different investment climate areas.
Two recent studies are of interest to benchmark Costa Rica’s ­economic growth: (i) Araujo
et al (2014) studies economic growth in Latin
American and the Caribbean for 1970–2010,
updating the work of Loayza, Fajnzylber, &
Calderón (2005); and (ii) Swiston and Barrot
78

(2011) examine the role of structural reforms
in raising economic growth in Central America for 1960–2009.30 Benchmarking Costa Rica
against top performers in LAC, Araujo et al.
(2014) found the largest effects on per capita
GDP growth from lowering inflation, increasing financial depth, increasing trade openness,
improving infrastructure, and improving the
education level of the workforce.31 When Costa
Rica is benchmarked against OECD countries,
the largest effects on growth will come from a
better road ­infrastructure, greater financial
depth, lowering inflation, improving the education level of the workforce, and increasing
trade openness. The magnitude of the estimated
effects suggests that per capita GDP growth
could have been two to 14 ­percent higher, providing an indication of forgone growth and its
potential impact on poverty reduction. Swiston and Barrot (2011) conclude that structural
reforms in the financial sector (particularly
improvement in bank supervision and development of domestic security markets) and in
product markets (agriculture liberalization,
flexibility in electricity [independent regulator
and wholesale market], and telecommunications with private participation) could raise
growth by about two percentage points. In fact,
Costa Rica has already ­undertaken a major reform in telecommunications, which has contributed positively to economic activity.
Furthermore, competitiveness challenges
could affect Costa Rica’s strong track record
for attracting FDI. The exit of Intel from its
manufacturing operations, foreign investors’
growing shift towards service functions, and
increasing competition from other countries
for FDI mean that Costa Rica cannot lag behind in its capacity to upgrade the areas that
are important to continue to attract FDI and
maximize their spillover into the local economy. A study of five global value chains
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

highlights areas that could strengthen their
growth, such as increasing the supply of
skilled labor.
The consequences of these competitiveness
challenges have become more evident after the
global crisis. These challenges are the result of
several forces: monetary and exchange rate
policies that have resulted in an appreciation
of the exchange rate, an education system that
is not generating enough graduates demanded
by the high-technology sectors, inadequate
supply and quality of infrastructure, and public sector administration that has not evolved
quickly enough to respond to the change of
the economy. Addressing them will be important to preserve Costa Rica’s competitive edge.

Exchange rate appreciation

Although inflation has dropped to single
digits since the global crisis, the real effective
exchange rate has appreciated, negatively affecting Costa Rica’s international competitiveness (figure 4.15).32 Domestic inflation

persistently above that of the United States
(its major trading partner) and large capital
inflows put appreciating pressure on the exchange rate. The real effective exchange rate
(REER) index appreciated by 12.3 ­percent in
2011–13, negatively affecting Costa Rica’s international competitiveness. During that period, the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR)
actively intervened in the foreign exchange
market, buying foreign currency to keep the
exchange rate above the lower end of the target range. As a result, net international reserves rose from US$4.8 ­billion at end-2011
to US$7.3 billion at end-2013. The BCCR
sterilized the resulting monetary expansion
with domestic bonds, which pay a substantially higher interest than the returns it gets
on international reserves. Consequently, in
2013, the BCCR quasi-fiscal deficit rose to
0.9 percent of GDP, and its debt stood at
about 10 ­percent of GDP.
Greater exchange rate flexibility could
have several advantages for the country.
In early 2015, the BCCR abandoned the

exchange rate band, allowing more flexibility
to the exchange rate, as part of its transition
to inflation targeting. Allowing pressures
on the external position to be absorbed by
the exchange rate would facilitate facing external shocks and could help prevent a sudden drop in reserves. Changes in world
prices would be transmitted more directly
to the local economy, thereby aligning incentives to changing international conditions. Further, as both creditors and debtors
perceive higher risk regarding the direction
and magnitude of exchange rate fluctuations, the new exchange rate regime could
lead to a gradual de-dollarization of the
economy.33

High wages and mismatch of
skills and jobs

Relatively high wages have made Costa Rica
less viable in low value-added sectors. High

income levels, coupled with generous social
benefits, have resulted in high reservation
wages across the board. Figure 4.16 plots
hourly wages (in constant 2001 US Dollars)
between 2000 and 2012 in two sectors that
traditionally employ low-skilled workers:
agriculture (primary sector) and low-tech
industry (light manufacturing) for Central
American countries and Chile (one of Costa
Rica’s structural peers). Except for Chile,
Costa Rica displayed the highest wages in
these sectors over the period 2000–2012.34
After 2006, the gap in real wages between
Costa Rican workers and the others started
to widen, but it did even more so after 2010,
partly attributed to the appreciation of the
real effective exchange rate. Textile exports
have dropped dramatically from 13.3 percent of exports in 2000 to 1.6 percent in
2014, mainly attributed to high production
costs in Cost Rica in relation to neighboring
countries.

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

Changing patterns in FDI and trade
have created excess demand for high skills,
putting upward pressure on the salaries of
high-skilled workers.35 Most of the reduction in jobs comes from sectors that tend
to employ low-skilled workers (figure 3.2),
such as agriculture and construction. It is
precisely in these sectors where job creation
has been minimal or even negative in the
last six years (figure 4.17). At the other end
of the spectrum, sectors that employ mostly
skilled workers, such as financial services,
real estate, personal services, and others,
are growing fast (though from a low base in
the case of sectors such as utilities or financial services).
As such, returns to education have increased along with inequality in Costa Rica in
the 2000s, in contrast to trends in most other
LAC countries. In much of the region, the returns to higher levels of education began to
fall in the 1990s—and continued during the
2000s—as more students achieved higher

Figure 4.17

levels of education. This decline in the returns
to education contributed in part to the historic fall in inequality in many LAC countries
over the past 15 years.36 Costa Rica’s path has
been different from the rest of the region, for
trends both in inequality and in the returns
to education. Specifically, in Costa Rica, the
returns to education fell during the 1980s
(over a decade before similar patterns emerged
in the region), thus contributing to a reduction in inequality during that period.37 However, contrary to LAC, the returns to education
remained roughly constant during the 1990s
and early 2000s in Costa Rica, and they
started to rise again after 2007. Thus, the premium for having completed secondary education rose by 11 percentage points between
2007 and 2013 and by six percentage points
for those with any tertiary education (figure
4.18). This is consistent with a pattern of
skill-biased technological change, which generates relatively more skilled occupations, a
phenomenon also documented in a study of

the evolution of occupations over the last two
decades, and which shows that Costa Rica
has followed a pattern of changes in occupations similar to high-­income countries.38
And yet, the workforce is not well
adapted to the current needs of the labor
market, creating a deficit of workers with
the skills demanded by the fastest growing
sectors. Indeed, less than half of the cohort
25–29 years old (42.3 percent) had achieved
a secondary or higher education by 2010,
which is worrisome for a country that aims
for a structural shift into “new economy”
sectors. In turn, the higher education system is biased towards social sciences and
does not sufficiently generate graduates
with the skills ­demanded, such as basic science and engineering (­figure 4.19).39 In
other words, students still prefer to study
careers that had growing demand during
the 1980s and 1990s, rather than those that
82

have high demand (and growing wages)
today.40 The technology sectors, in particular, are affected by the relatively small
skilled labor force. For example, a study of
skills needs in network technology estimates that the gap between demand and
supply of skilled labor in Costa Rica in
2011 was 36 percent, and for 2015 this gap
was projected to expand to 48 percent; the
worst among the eight Latin American
countries included in the study.41 Another
study by the Costa Rican Chamber of Technology of Information and Communications
(Cámara de Tecnologías de Infor­mación y
Comunicaciones) showed that, in 2008, the
country had lost an estimated US$72 million, as a consequence of the lack of technicians and professionals in this area. The
technology sector is not the only one affected by this trend: CANATUR (Costa Rican
Chamber of Tourism), called attention to a

shortage of human capital in the tourism
industry.
Moreover, regulatory procedures do
not facilitate the recognition of foreign degrees, which could help to fill the skills gaps.
The norms that govern the recognition of
qualifications, particularly the Regulations
Governing Article 30 of the Agreement for
Higher Education Coordination of State
Universities, were defined in 1986 and have
not been updated. Institutional arrangements are also fragmented: academic qualifications and university degrees are evaluated
by the various higher education institutions
that form CONARE (Consejo Nacional de
Rectores, National Council of Rectors), while
those granted by other kinds of higher education institutions (para-­university institutions) are evaluated by the Council for
Higher Education. Although CONARE has
defined common criteria for the documents
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

needed for recognition, requirements for obtaining recognition and equivalency may
vary depending on the institution carrying
out the evaluation. There is no unified procedure for presenting appeals against adverse
decisions.
The difficulties created by this fragmented
and outdated system can result in denial of
work authorizations for otherwise qualified
workers with foreign degrees. Thus, Costa
Rica has obstacles to either “produce” or “import” the high skills needed to sustain its
high value-added growth model. Regulations
and procedures should be updated and unified, in line with international criteria; and
measures should be taken to facilitate accreditation, adoption of a list of institutions
with established quality, and efficient processing of “similar cases” whereby applicants
have similar titles, degrees, and qualifications
as previous candidates.

Infrastructure:
telecommunications, transport,
and electricity

Infrastructure coverage and access are relatively good. Over several decades of investment, the country built an extensive network
of highway and feeder roads, electric power
grids, and telecommunication system in the
context of the “Social Compact” that also put
an emphasis on providing universal access to
infrastructure services that would improve the
wellbeing of the population.42 Costa Rica has
two times the road and three times the rail
density of the average middle-income country
and is behind only Lithuania and the OECD
on these indicators (figure 4.20). Access to
electricity in rural areas and mobile services is
nearly universal. The liberalization of the telecommunication sector allowed for fast growth
in access to mobile and broadband services.43
The vast coverage of infrastructure has historically supported Costa Rica’s trade and growth
and standards of living.
The overall quality of infrastructure is
low compared to structural peers. Figure
4.21a shows the World Economic Forum
Index on the overall quality of infrastructure, showing that Costa Rica has the worst
ranking. This low ranking is mainly attributed to the poor quality of ports, roads, and
railways (figure 4.21b).
Telecommunications. Despite progress
in the coverage of telecommunication services, areas outside the Free Trade Zones
(FTZs) and in protected areas have lower
access, creating regional disparities in com­
petitiveness for local firms. Between 2008
and 2012, the percentage of households
with a cellphone increased from 69 percent
to 97 percent.44 During the same period,
84

the percentage of households with Internet
access increased from 15 percent to 47
percent; however, it is still highly concentrated in the Central region, with much
lower access in areas with higher poverty
rates or with indigenous populations (top
row of figure 4.22). Interestingly, cantons
that have Free Trade Zones (FTZs) have on
average better cellphone and Internet penetration (bottom row of figure 4.22) than
cantons with no FTZ. Internet access in
cantons with FTZs is 15 percentage points
higher than in cantons without them (42
percent versus 27 percent, respectively).
Similarly, cell phone use is five percentage
points higher in cantons with FTZs (ICT
and quality broadband are required in the
high-tech sectors which predominate in
the FTZs).45 At the other extreme, cantons
with Protected Areas, which attract tourists, have lower access than the rest.
Transport. Despite good access, the quality
of transport services is deficient. On the two
most widely used international rankings of
transport service provision—the World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness
Index and the World Bank’s Logistics Perfor­
mance Index (LPI)—Costa Rica barely reaches
the middle point among the 160–170 countries ranked, scoring below peer middle-­
income countries and well below the average
OECD country. Costa Rica ranked 87th out of
160 countries on the 2014 LPI, with a score of
2.7 (figure 4.24). Costa Rica’s score is comparable to the middle-income average but well
below the OECD average of 3.7. The country’s
mediocre ranking can be traced to poor
perfor­mance in customs and border clearance,46 but also to poor quality of transport infrastructure, particularly in infrastructure that
concerns port services. Costa Rica’s score and

rank on the quality of its port infrastructure is
the lowest among middle-income peers, scoring a 3.0 on port quality and ranking 115th out
of 160 countries (figure 4.21b). A bit more
promising is the air transport quality in which
Costa Rica scores 4.6 and ranks 61st (out of
160). The results for transport quality are similarly poor on the WEF’s competi­tiveness
index. Costa Rica scores about 40 percent of
the maximum score of seven points on the inThe Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

dex’s user assessment of road and port quality
(with scores of 2.8 and 3.0, respec­tively). This
score puts the country behind the performance of similar middle-income countries
(which average 3.5 to 3.7) and very far from
the infrastructure services delivered in the average OECD country (5.2 to 5.3). In contrast
to other countries, Costa Rica has not made
progress in its connectivity with global shipping networks.

Weak road and port infrastructure cause
major losses and delays in land and sea
transport.47 An extreme example of poor
road quality comes from rural routes serving
the pineapple industry. On the trip from
farm to distribution center, product losses
can be 50 percent larger than for the much
longer trip from Costa Rica to Rotterdam.48
Costa Rica also performs at the bottom of
the middle-income group in quality of its
port infrastructure, with a score of 3.0, and
ranking 115th out of 160. A salient illustration is the Port of Limón. Responsible for
most of Costa Rica’s maritime traffic, the
port has very low productivity and long delays: the median time between a ship’s port
arrival and its dock arrival is more than 15
hours, compared to a normally acceptable
range of five hours.49
Not surprisingly, firms in FTZs tend to
rely more intensively on air transport—which
is more efficient than ports in Costa Rica. In
value terms, about two-thirds of FTZs’ exports are shipped via air transport, which is a
more expensive but faster transport mode.
86

Air transport becomes attractive and cost-­
effective as a modal alternative when goods
are highly perishable or, more important,
when value added is over a certain threshold.
And although ports in Costa Rica have the
worst rating in the region, the air transport
market appears to be competitive for LAC
standards.50 In fact, air transport quality in
Costa Rica scores 4.6 and ranks 61st out of
160 in the LPI (figure 4.21b).
Electricity. Electricity tariffs have increased significantly in recent years, affecting production costs. Between 2007 and
2013, the real industrial electric tariff increased from eight to 20 US cents per kWh
(figure 4.25). Industrial and commercial
electricity tariffs are competitive relative to
the rest of Central America but high relative to other competitors with larger markets, such as China, Mexico, and the
United States.
The rise in electricity tariffs originates
from a combination of factors due to the energy mix and governance issues of the sector.

First, due to its high reliance on hydropower
generation, the power sector is particularly
vulnerable to rainfall variability. Hydropower
output has been increasingly variable over
the past decade due to successive dry years,

and the country has struggled to meet demand with renewable energy sources.51 Between 2000 and 2013, the share of ­thermal

of generation due to high fuel cost. Thus, the
transition path toward a carbon neutral economy has been a major challenge: in the last
two years, existing thermal generation capacity has been dispatched during the entire
year. The cost of thermal generation is influenced by oil prices and by expensive thermal
generation leasing agreements. Fuel expenditures are now reflected in the tariff.52 Second,
88

although technical losses in transmission and
distributions are low (10 ­percent) compared
to other countries, ICE’s operating performance could be improved (figure 4.26). With
197 ­customers per employee, ICE (Instituto
Costarricense de Electricidad, Costa Rican
Electricity Institute) is the worst performer
among regional peers (Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Panama, and
Uruguay). Although there is not data available on the level of salaries and benefits provided to ICE’s employees, using data from the
ENAHO the average central government to
private sector wage premium was ­estimated
at 23 percent in 2012—and this premium was
49 percent for other public sector entities (for
example, state-owned enterprises).53 Third,
high depreciation costs—due to an accelerated depreciation schedule—have also increased operational costs that result in higher
electricity tariffs. For example, depreciation
accounted for 17 percent of generation cost
in 2013.54 Finally, ICE expanded its generation capacity through expensive leasing
­arrangements that have led to higher operational costs and electricity tariffs. Although
these arrangements allowed ICE to finance
its generation expansion, they have carried
higher interest costs and shorter maturity
than other financing alternatives. These leasing arrangements (alquileres) accounted for
15.4 percent of operating costs in 2010–12
and will increase to 19 percent in
2013–2015.55
Indicators of service quality, such as waiting periods for new connections and frequency and duration of outages, are below
those of its structural peers. This is particularly troublesome because of Costa Rica’s interest in developing high-tech industries for
which highly reliable electricity is essential.

Surveys, private companies in Costa Rica reported an average waiting period of 39 days
for a new electricity connection, which is the
highest in Central America and 17 days
higher than the regional average. Although
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

in terms of frequency of outages Costa Rican
firms experience 1.3 outages in a typical
month, this is higher than OECD countries
(0.4), Panama (0.6), or Uruguay (0.2). A
similar pattern is observed for the duration
89

of outages. To address quality problems, ICE
offers agreements to businesses in which the
quantity and quality of electricity supply are
clearly indicated, and those businesses can
finance ICE’s investments in exchange for
lower tariffs.56
Sector governance is weak, resulting in
bottlenecks that affect the overall operational
and economic efficiency of the sector. The
roles and responsibilities of ICE, ARESEP
(Autoridad Reguladora de los Servicios Públi­
cos, Regulatory Authority of Public Services),
and MINAE (Ministerio de Ambiente, En­
ergía y Telecomunicaciones, Ministry of Environment, Energy, and Telecommunications)
overlap in some areas, causing inefficient
planning and policy formation outcomes.
MINAE is currently developing the VII national energy plan with public consultations
(“mesas de dialogo”). The key focus areas for
the consultations are: energy efficiency, distributed generation, optimizing the electricity matrix, and social and environmental
issues. Costa Rica’s institutional framework
may not be sufficiently flexible to respond to
the strategic and expansion needs of the sector. ICE faces a significant financing gap
(Costa Rica needs to invest over $8 billion in
the energy sector over the next twenty years),
but there is no clear plan on how to increase
private sector participation to attract needed
investment, especially considering the existing legal constraints. The corporate governance of ICE compares somewhat poorly
with peer countries in Latin America (see
box 4.2).
Expansion of the electricity supply is constrained by social-environmental restrictions,
the capacity of ICE to finance new generation
assets, and legal caps on private sector participation. The first challenge is how to address an
increasing gap between the demand and supply
90

of electricity with renewable sources only.
Costa Rica will need to double its installed capacity in the next 20 years. A large hydro project is under construction (Reventazon, 305
MW) and will start operations in 2016–17,
significantly contributing to increase the system’s reserve margin. The project cost has
been estimated at around US$1.4 billion,
which at US$4.6 million per MW is on the
high end of the range for new hydropower
projects in Central America and clearly above
global benchmarks. This much-needed capacity is necessary to ensure the security of the
country’s supply; however, the high capital
cost will have an impact on the capital components of the tariff (depreciation and return on
assets). Indeed, investment costs could be further reduced in future capacity additions if a
competitive mechanism for granting hydro
concessions and resulting electricity contracts
was in place. Another large hydro project
(Diquis, 700 MW) is confronting complex environmental and social issues.57 Expanding
generation capacity with geo-thermal energy,
which is not affected by rainfall variability and
can be dispatched in base-load, will require
handling environmental regulations with protected areas as most volcanos are in national
parks. The second challenge is how to finance
the large costs associated with any project.
ICE’s capacity to issue new debt is limited to
certain thresholds. The legal framework limits
private sector participation through independent power producers (IPP) and build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes to no more than
30 percent of installed capacity.
Addressing the infrastructure gap.
The deficiencies in productive infrastructure raise concerns about the adequacy of
the levels of spending and implementation
capacity for infrastructure projects. Costa

Corporate Governance of State-Owned Electric Utility ICE

The corporate governance of state-owned electric utility ICE was considered poor when
evaluated in 2009 against five key components of corporate governance (legal soundness,
board and CEO competitiveness, professional management, performance orientation, and
transparency and disclosure). ICE ranked 10th in the aggregated “corporate governance
index” when compared to a peer group of 13 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) operating in
the Latin American region. ICE ranked 11th in the group, in terms of performance orientation (process of setting objectives, the instruments used to set objectives and their enforcement, and the authority that conducts the assessments). This is indeed one of the
areas where ICE seems to be weak.

Rica has made significant efforts to increase infrastructure investment since the
structural freeze of investment imposed in
the nineties but has not yet been able to
­leverage significant private sector funds.
After investing no public funds in infrastructure throughout the 1990s, Costa Rica
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

has recommitted to an investment program. In fact, in 2012 Costa Rica invested
the most in infrastructure as a percentage
of GDP (5.47 percent) of any Latin American
country.58 However, the vast majority of
this investment is public sector spending:
private participation represents only 10
91

percent of total spending (­figure 4.27). The
necessity of continuing to invest in infrastructure and the reality of fiscal constraints mean that Costa Rica must
encourage more private sector participation in the construction and maintenance
of its infrastructure. The lack of investment
in maintenance is particularly acute in the
road sector, where a cycle of underinvestment leading to deterioration that requires
still more resources has been created.59
Expenditure on public infrastructure is
uneven across sectors, implementation is
deficient, and expenditure has not been able
to keep up with needed investments. Public
investment has been dominated by the
transport and energy sectors with increasing
investment in telecommunications in recent
years. Historically, investment in water and

Figure 4.27

sanitation has been very low, but there has
been a recent increase. Poor implementation
of infrastructure projects also contributes to
the large infrastructure gap.60 For example,
the Legislative Assembly takes between 1.5
to 2.2 years to approve external loans by the
­Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
Also, of the $2,000 million in loans from
multilateral institutions only 28 percent has
been executed.61 Limited execution is also
reflected in the contraction of 2.6 percent,
while it grew in most sectors. A failure of institutions is also apparent in the roads sector
where resources made available by multilateral organizations have not been put to use
because of inadequate management.
Infrastructure limitations and growing
environmental challenges could affect further expansion of the tourism industry. As

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

discussed earlier, the stock of infrastructure
covers most of the country, protected areas
still have coverage deficiencies, and in particular quality of infrastructure is low.
Moreover, the growing urban population
creates pressure on public services like
waste management (solid and water), which
do not comply with international standards
for environmental sustainability. To make
sure that green tourism can continue to
grow in Costa Rica, it is necessary to coordinate the efforts of a large number of public actors, from infrastructure, health,
training, and other institutions.

Business regulations

Business regulations and red tape also affect
competitiveness. Costa Rica ranks poorly in

construction are the areas mostly ­affected by
these factors.

Access to finance

Costa Rica’s financial system is highly dollarized and dominated mainly by public banks,
although the system has become more diversified in recent years. Dollarization is widespread in Costa Rica. Forty-one percent of
deposits and loans to the private sector were
denominated in dollars at the end of 2014 (figure 4.29).63 Higher interest rates for loans in
local currency and a stable exchange rate explain the attractiveness of borrowing in dollars. The widespread dollarization of the
economy adds vulnerability to the financial

system and undermines the effectiveness of
monetary policy since it operates on a smaller
monetary base.64 Public banks account for 50
percent of the system’s lending to the private
sector, private banks’ share is 31.4 percent, and
non-bank financial intermediaries (for example, cooperatives, finance companies, and mutualistas) represent about 19 percent of the
total system’s credit to the private sector.
Credit to the private sector has grown
slowly, and its level is below that for structural peers. Liberalization of the banking
sector in the mid-1990s reignited credit,
which grew from a low 18.5 percent in 1998
to 32 percent in 2004 and 50 percent in 2013
(figure 4.30). This level of financing is still
low when compared to structural peers and
OECD countries (figure 4.31).

Credit growth slowdown after the global
crisis and its growth has been uneven
across sectors. Credit growth accelerated in
2014, reaching 17 percent as a result of the
government having removed in August
2013 the limits it had imposed at the beginning of the year. Credit in foreign currency
grew faster than in local currency, but that
trend has so far been reversed in 2014
when credit in local currency grew faster
(figure 4.32). Growth in credit is uneven
across different sectors of the economy. The
area of highest growth within banks’ portfolio is retail lending (consumer and housing), which averaged 52.6 percent of private
credit in 2010–14, double the average in the
1990s (25.7 percent). Lending for housing,
services, and consumers have increased

contrast, the share of lending to agriculture
and industries decreased in the past two
decades to 4.4 percent in 2010–2014.
The penetration of financial services
among firms and the population, especially
the poor, is low. Costa Rican firms do not
compare favorably in their use of banks to
finance investments or working capital (22
and 30 percent, respectively) when compared to the Latin American average or
structural peers (see figure 4.34). In the case
of individuals, access to finance indicators
are above regional peers; however, poorer
segments (for example, the bottom 40
­percent of income earners) of the Costa
Rican population have much more limited
access. According to the World Bank Financial Inclusion database from 2014 (Findex),

over the age of 15 has an account at a formal
financial institution, well above the regional
average of 51 percent. The gap in access between those in the bottom 40 percent of income earners and the top 60 percent is only
5 percentage points, about half than for the
regional average.
The banking system has adequate levels
of capitalization and asset quality. According to the Financial Soundness Indicators
(FSIs), banks had a capital adequacy ratio
of 16.2 percent in July 2014, well above international standards. Non-performing
loans (NPLs) stood at 1.7 percent, with
high level of provisions. Profitability, measured as return on equity, was stable in
2013/2014 at around eight percent, but
lower than other countries in the region,
such as Chile (21 percent) or Panama (15.6
percent).

3. The telecommunication sector attracted large
FDI flows, produced a significant consumer
surplus advantage from the reduction in
prices and increase in Internet and cellular
line access, increasing its contribution to GDP
(World Bank, 2013a). New private telecommunication companies and ICE contributed more
to the value added in telecommunications, as
they provided more services and added new
clients, generating new revenues.

5. World Bank. (2006a). Apart from reducing
industrial policy regulation and initiating a
gradual opening of the economy, it brought the
fiscal situation under control by both increasing taxes and curtailing expenditures. On the
revenue side, the value added tax rate was

increased and the tax base broadened. On the
expenditure side, most agricultural subsidies
were eliminated, public sector salaries were
frozen, and the public pension system was
reformed. The colon became fully convertible,
and a crawling peg policy was implemented to
stabilize the real exchange rate and maintain
external competitiveness.

objective indicators of investment climate constraints (governance and institutional quality;
infrastructure; access to finance; and education,
skills, and technology) on firm performance
indicators, such as labor productivity, total
factor productivity, and wages. The authors
benchmarked firm performance against five
different scenarios: moving to Ireland’s investment climate, moving to Chile’s investment climate, the 75th percentile of the entire sample of
firms, the 75th percentile within same industry
and firm size, and the 75th percentile within
same industry, firm size, and country.
The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

29. Some of the limitations of cross-country
growth regression include: omitted variables,
instruments used for the GMM estimation
may be mis-specified, explanatory variables
may not capture the structural or stabilization policies that are most relevant, and risk of
over-fitting the model.
30. These studies rely on cross-country regressions, using five-year non-overlapping data,
and generalized method of moments (GMM)
estimators for dynamic models of panel data.
The GMM estimation takes into account
unobserved country-specific effects and the
joint endogeneity of the explanatory variables
(growth drivers) with the dependent variable (economic growth) in a dynamic model
of panel data. Araujo et al. (2014) use a sample of 126 countries and Swiston and Barrot
(2011) use a sample of 79 countries. Araujo et
al. (2014) classify the determinants of growth
into structural and stabilization policies.
Structural policies include education (human
capital), financial depth, trade openness, government burden, infrastructure, and governance. Stabilization policies include measures
of fiscal, monetary, and financial policies, such
as price stability and real exchange rate overvaluation. Swiston and Barrot (2011) use a set
of structural indexes to gauge the extent of
reforms.
31. The analysis finds that, if Costa Rica were a
top performance in government size (i.e., by
having a smaller government, as measured
by government consumption expenditure as
a share of GDP), its GDP per capita would be
12 percent higher. That is because the benchmarking exercise, due to the estimated coefficients of the model, views government size as
something negative to improve upon. However,
one has to consider that Costa Rica may have
large government consumption due to its social
compact, allocating around 23 percent of GDP
to public health and education.
32. While the real exchange rate affects international competitiveness, it is an endogenous
variable, which the authorities can use only in
the short term. In the longer term, competitiveness is determined by the structural factors
elaborated later in this chapter.

33. The widespread dollarization of the economy
adds vulnerability to the financial system and
undermines the effectiveness of monetary policy, since it operates on a smaller monetary
base. As of December 2014, forty-one percent
of deposits and loans to the private sector were
denominated in dollars.
34. The real wage in agriculture in Honduras dramatically increased in 2011, with no apparent
explanation. This data point is excluded from

39. This problem is more acute in private universities, which produce over half of the total

options for study are in social sciences and
education.

objectives of the 2008 telecommunication law
is to ensure the provision of universal access,
regardless of geographical location or economic status.
43. Increased penetration in mobile services is
explained by the introduction of a prepaid
mobile-cellular service and low tariffs. The
forces of competition provided an abundant
supply of services, prices for Internet access
were reduced dramatically, and Costa Ricans
have responded by subscribing massively to
the new services.
44. World Bank (2013a).
45. This correlation does not address the underlying causality: did better infrastructure and
ICT follow the creation of an FTZ, or did FTZs
choose to locate in cantons with better infrastructure and ICT? Nonetheless, the fact that
FTZs exist in cantons with better conditions
provides an opportunity for service spillovers,

and for firms to take advantage of the agglomeration economies that infrastructure networks can facilitate.

to reduce the banks’ open foreign exchange
positions. The authorities granted a four-year
implementation period in 2013 to allow the
banks to gradually rebalance their loan portfolios and adapt to new regulations.

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

5. Sustainability of Costa Rica’s
Development Model
The sustainability of its development model is at risk due to the deterioration of fiscal balances, tensions
in the Social Compact, and various threats to the Green Trademark. The fiscal situation stands out as
one of the most pressing development challenges facing Costa Rica. The recent deterioration stems from
a combination of countercyclical measures undertaken during the crisis and structural forces. Without
fiscal consolidation, the deficit could push public debt to unsustainable levels and threaten the country’s
social and economic gains. Indeed, fiscal pressures, as well as rising inequality and increasing dissatis­
faction with social services, all combine to create tensions in the Social Compact. Costa Rica’s leader­
ship in environmental conservation faces the challenge of growing pressures on the use of resources and
of urbanization. Changing economic incentives threaten the gains in reforestation, and the use of
agro-chemicals is worrisome. Urbanization has increased energy use and air and water pollution, and
the country has not developed a long-term plan to protect the environment from these threats. Finally,
the current political landscape and institutional framework add an additional layer of complexity for
approving and implementing key reforms needed to address these emerging challenges.

Fiscal Sustainability
The fiscal situation is arguably one of
the most pressing development challenges facing Costa Rica. Growing deficits could push
the public debt to unsustainable levels and
constrain resources for public investment, social services, and environmental goals.

Fiscal deterioration since
the global crisis: deficits and
public debt

The fiscal situation has weakened substantially since the global crisis, with the overall
deficit of the Central Government growing
to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and surpassing six percent in 2014 and projected to
reach 6.5 in 2015 (figure 5.1). As a result,
public debt has increased by 12 percentage
points over the past five years, from 25

Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

percent of GDP in 2008 to 37 percent by
2013, with projections of 63 percent by 2019
unless corrective measures are implemented
(Figure 5.1).1 A study by the IMF estimates
that Costa Rica has to lower its primary deficit by 3.5 percent of GDP to achieve debt
sustainability and by 4.5 percent of GDP to
bring its debt ratio to the pre-crisis level.2
Fiscal deterioration after the global crisis
is not unique to Costa Rica. figure 5.2 and
figure 5.3 present the overall and primary
deficits, respectively, of Costa Rica and of
the structural peer countries. The fiscal balance worsens for all countries. However, although Costa Rica was among the better
performing countries before the crisis (third
below Chile and Uruguay), after the crisis it
was among the worst: its primary balance
was only slightly smaller than Lithuania and
Croatia, and its overall deficit was the second largest of the group. 3

Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

A consequence of weakening fiscal accounts is the downgrading of Costa Rica’s
­investment rating. In September 2014, Stan­
dard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgraded
the country’s rating due to fiscal trends and
the foreseen difficulties in passing a comprehensive tax reform that could put the debt
on a sustainable path. The longer the delay to
­address the fiscal deficit, the larger will be
the adjustment needed to stabilize the public
debt ratio and the potential impact on the
poorer segments of the population.

The growing deficit: cyclical
measures and structural forces

This recent fiscal deterioration stems from
countercyclical measures undertaken during
the crisis and structural forces. Moreover,
countercyclical measures adopted during the
crisis were structural, rather than temporary,
further adding to existing rigidities in government finances and spending.
The set of policy actions taken to confront the global economic crisis has long-­
lasting implications for fiscal accounts. As
in many other countries, Costa Rica faced
the global crisis by implementing countercyclical fiscal policies. This was welcomed,
given the magnitude of the crisis and the
fiscal space the country had at the time,
because the primary balance was positive
and public debt was below 25 percent of
GDP in 2008. However, unlike other countries, which implemented temporary fiscal
policies, Costa Rica adopted policies with
long-­lasting structural effects. Specifically,
it chose to implement steep, permanent increases in public salaries in 2008–10, and
the wage bill of the public sector continued
to grow even after the crisis. Current trans­
fers also doubled to five percent of GDP.
104

And revenues, which had increased steeply
prior to the crisis, dropped back to average
levels from 2000–05 (figure 5.1).
Public sector wages are particularly high
in Costa Rica, as compared with other countries and the private sector. The public sector
wage policy adopted during the crisis aimed
to increase salaries in the central government
to the 50th percentile (known as the percentil
50) of pay for similar jobs in the rest of the
public sector. Originally intended to adjust
the wages of some categories of public sector
workers, it expanded throughout most entities of the central government as well as decentralized institutions.4 As such, the wage
bill of the central government rose (increasing from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.4
percent in 2014), and the consolidated wage
bill of the overall public sector expanded significantly (climbing from seven percent of
GDP to 10 percent in 2010). Public sector
compensation is much higher in Costa Rica
than in other countries, given its level of GDP
and government revenues—and public sector
wages are significantly higher than private
sector wages, in particular for state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) (figure 5.4 and ­figure 5.5).
Another “big ticket item” on the expenditure side is pensions. Costa Rica’s public pension system includes the main pension fund
(Seguro de Invalidez, Vejez y Muerte), a noncontributory social pension, and special pension regimes for teachers, civil servants, and
the judiciary. The first two are managed by
the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social
(CCSS), which also operates the universal
health insurance system. Although the CCSS
pension accounts are currently roughly balanced, with aging and demographic pressures they will likely face an imbalance in the
foreseeable future. Even more pressing are
the balances of the special pension regimes.

Over­all government support to special pension regimes will cost Costa Rica about 59
percent of (2012) GDP over the next four decades.5 A recent study by the IMF projects
that the special regime for the judiciary will
start to run deficits very soon, and will deplete its assets by 2030; the special regime for
the civil service is projected to run flat at 2.4
percent of GDP through 2020, and will slowly
diminish after that. Moreover, the special regimes are far more generous than the CCSS
regime, which raises the question of equity,
apart from their burden on the fiscal accounts.6 For instance, in 2012, the CCSS spent
2.2 percent of GDP in general pension payments for 190,000 pensioners, against 2.6
percent of GDP for 62,500 pensioners of the
special regimes. And while the average annual
pension of a retired worker of the general
­system of the CCSS amounts to around 50
percent of GDP per capita, the average pension of a retired civil servant is about 170
percent of GDP per capita, and the average
pension of a retired judge is about 270 percent
of GDP per capita.
Managing expenditures is further complicated by extensive rigidities built into the system. These rigidities stem from the index­ation
of public sector wages and pensions, as well as
numerous spending mandates. These include
both constitutional expenditure mandates
with­out corresponding financing sources, as
well as legally required expenditures.7 For example, there is a constitutional mandate to increase expenditures in education from six to
eight percent of GDP. There are also legal
mandates for allocations to municipalities,
housing subsidies, earmarked taxes, wages,
pensions, and interest payments on the debt.
The sum total of all of these rigidities leaves
the government with only five percent of the
annual budget for strategic allocative decisions
106

in any given year—and also limits its ability to
control expenditures and the deficit. 8
Further, the budget process is fragmented
and much of it is outside the control of the
central government. Parliament approves
only the budget of the central government,
which represents about one-third of consolidated public expenditures. The budgets of
decentralized institutions, public enterprises,
financial intermediaries, and de-concentrated
entities is determined largely by their heads
under budget caps and guidelines provided
by the Ministry of Finance and subject to
modification and monitoring by the Office
of the Comptroller General (CGR).
Structural rigidities also prevail on the
revenue side. Although overall revenue collection is on par with upper-middle- and
high-income countries, at around 22 percent
of GDP, tax revenues are low (13.5 percent
of GDP) and a large share of the remaining
revenues are earmarked to autonomous public institutions (such as social security contributions for pensions and health insurance,
which are managed by the CCSS). Moreover,
since 1953, Parliament has approved 1,259
tax exemptions, of which only 23 percent
had a time limit. Further, nearly half of these
exemptions have no clear definition of the
tax that is exempted.9 The potential magnitude of these exemptions for revenues is
quite large, amounting to 5.6 percent of GDP.
Finally, the budgets of SOEs do not require
Parliamentary approval, and SOEs do not
publish data. In an attempt to address the situation, Congress approved a fiscal reform in
2012, but it was deemed unconstitutional by
the Supreme Court on the basis of procedural irregularities.
In addition, coordination between fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policy is limited. Fiscal policy has not been sufficiently
Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

coordinated with monetary policy, and the fiscal deficit is adding to inflationary pressures.
The BCCR-stated objective is to move to a
fully inflation-targeting system, and the recent
measure of floating the exchange rate, abandoning the pre-defined bands, is a move in the
right direction. It is expected that this policy
change will reduce dollarization of the financial system, reducing a source of vulnerability.

Sustainability of the
Social Compact
To ensure sustainability of the Social
Compact, Costa Rica must confront the triple challenges of fiscal pressures on social
spending, increasing dissatisfaction with public services, and rising inequality. First, the
deterioration of the fiscal system implies potential tradeoffs among social goals—and the
need for improved quality and efficiency of
social spending. Second, increasing dissatisfaction with the quality of health care symbolizes
the numerous “cracks in the system” that are
emerging in the delivery of public services.
There is a sense that, although Costa Rica has
achieved impressive “levels” of performance
for many indicators (low poverty, life expectancy, literacy), it is increasingly constrained
on the “deltas” of adopting the changes
needed to make the transition to a modern
economy with an effective “Welfare State” in
the context of demographic transition. Third,
rising inequality has exposed disparities in
the education system and the mismatch of
skills and jobs, as well as the ineffectiveness of
social transfers to redistribute income to compensate for these inequities.

The long rise of social spending

Costa Rica’s Social Compact has deep historical roots. The construction of the Social
Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

Compact goes back to Costa Rica’s early
days as a coffee-producing economy of
small landholders (see chapter 1). It was
consolidated during the middle of the 20th
century with the creation of the universal
health and social security system Caja
­Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS) in
1941, the establishment of the Labor Code
in 1942, the guaranteeing of public education for all, and the 1949 Constitution,
which mandated basic social rights (complemented by extensive social welfare
legislation).
This ambitious Social Compact has had the
backing of high and rising social spending.
With the abolition of the army, the country
had more resources to invest in the provision
of basic public and social services to the entire
population. As a result, social spending started
to rise in the 1950s, reaching over three
percent of GDP by 1958 (figure 5.6). It then increased steadily over the decades, reaching almost 10 percent by the end of the 1990s and
20.8 percent by the end of the first decade of
the 2000s. This is close to the average level
spent by OECD countries,10 and significantly
higher than Central American neighbors (figure 5.7). Investment in education was initially
the highest category of social spending, but by
the 1990s health and pensions had both surpassed education. In 2012, total social spending amounted to 20.8 percent of GDP, with 7.4
percent for pensions, seven percent for health,
5.3 percent for education, and 1.1 percent for
social assistance.

universal services such as health care. Universal access to the health care system has
led to outstanding health outcomes for the
population. The ­country’s integrated and
universal health care system, managed by
the CCSS, has provided access to health
care to the entire population, including the
bottom 40 percent (figure 5.8). Universal
health care has been a key factor in improving key social indicators: life expectancy in Costa Rica is 82 for women and
above 77 for men, and child mortality is
low (about half of the Latin American and
Caribbean average). Institutional births are
virtually universal and maternal mortality
has fallen over the last 20 years, reaching
levels that are less than half of the LAC
average.

The country has also invested heavily in
infrastructure, providing the population with
universal access to electricity and water, and
an extensive road network covers most of the
country. Early on, Costa Rica built an extensive network of infrastructure in nearly all
productive service areas (water, sanitation,
transport, electricity, and telecommunications), responding to strong social demand.11
Access to electricity went from 40 percent of
households in 1950 to 99 percent by 2013. Access to improved water sources is also nearly
universal, with 96 percent of households having access to piped water and 92 percent with
access to drinking water. Costa Rica has twice
the road density and three times the rail density of the average middle-income country,
and is behind only Lithuania and the OECD

on these indicators. Coverage of telephone
lines increased dramatically, from 11 fixed
telephone lines per 1000 inhabitants in 1950
to 203 in 2012. Almost all households have
access to a cell phone (94 percent, higher than
the OECD average) and 50 percent to a fixed
phone line in 2013.12 This large endowment
of infrastructure has historically supported
Costa Rica’s economic growth and standards
of living.

Health care: increasing concerns
about quality and sustainability

Overall health spending has continued to
grow during the 2000s, raising concerns
about sustainability. Between 2000 and 2010,
total expenditure on health went from 6.5
percent of GDP to 10.1 percent. By 2012,
public expenditure was around seven percent
of GDP.13 This is far higher than public health
spending for countries of similar levels of
development (figure 5.9), and it exceeds

average public spending on health in OECD
countries (which averages 6.2 percent of
GDP).14
Moreover, recent increases in health
spending have not been matched by gains in
service delivery. Between 2005 and 2010, the
CCSS experienced a rapid increase in spending without revenue growth, where 97 percent
of the extra spending corresponded to an increase in the number and salary of employees.
This was not accompanied by an increase in
productivity: estimates suggest that between
2009 and 2011, average daily hospital production dropped from 69 to 61 days, and the
number of annual outpatient visits per professional declined from 758 to 654.15 Hence, recent increases in spending have not translated
into better services.
Health budget allocations do not take
into account demographic and demand
changes, and thus leads to inefficiency and
inequality of care. Budget allocation for
health facilities across the country is done on

the basis of historical allocation, instead of
current needs stemming from demographic
pressures and local morbidity patterns. As a
result, the resources that health centers receive are disconnected from the resources
they need, and this is leading to inequity in
the capacity to deliver care.
Furthermore, the current organization of
the system leads to increasing wait times and
patient frustration. The demographic change
in Costa Rica implies that as the population
ages, chronic conditions—which are more
costly to treat—will become more prevalent.
Yet, the 3-level organization of healthcare
(going back to the 1970s) is not well adapted
to a growing number of patients with
chronic conditions. Level-1 facilities are not
equipped to deal with such patients, thus
they refer them to level-2 or level-3 facilities,
which also have to deal with more complex
cases. This creates bottlenecks, whereas a
more consolidated system would be able to
deal with chronic cases (of low complexity).
Likewise, an outdated infrastructure and
information management system lowers
quality, and decreases transparency and efficiency of resource management. The current
health infrastructure does not reflect the
high level of spending: Costa Rica is considerably below the average of its peers both in
density of hospital beds and medical staff,
and a recent assessment by the CCSS found
that only 26 percent of hospitals and clinics
were in good or excellent condition.16 In addition, the information management system,
which dates back to the 1970s, has not been
adequately modernized, and as a result it is
highly fragmented and information flows are
very difficult. This hampers efficient resource
management and lowers the accountability
of the entire system (for example, most information systems, except clinical records in
Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

some health centers, are paper-based or at
best spreadsheets not linked to aggregated
databases).
As a result, private health costs are on the
rise, and the perception of quality is declining. Between 1995 and 2010 the share of private out-of-pocket spending has gone from
23.5 percent to 31.9 percent (of total health
spending). This has occurred in parallel to
the aging of the country’s population, which
has naturally increased the demand for health
services. As a result, users of the CCSS face
increasingly long wait times, in particular for
surgery and specialized treatments. Not surprisingly, patients who can afford private insurance policies often use them, not to pay
for complementary services to those covered
by the CCSS, but to get the same services
with a preferential treatment. This lowers the
transparency of the system, and generates inequities in access and quality of treatment,
which in turn fuels patient dissatisfaction
(figure 5.10).

Education: patterns of public
spending versus the skills gap

Similarly, Costa Rica has historically spent a
large share of GDP on education. During the
sustained growth period between 1950 and
1980, Costa Rica considerably expanded its
investment in human capital, particularly in
education. By the end of the 1950s, education expenditure was over two percent of
GDP, and by 1980 it had reached 4.4 percent.17
The crisis of the early 1980s caused a sharp
reduction in public spending across the
board (figure 5.11); for example, education
spending fell to 1.9 percent of GDP by 1982,
and by 1990 it was still only at 3.3 percent of
GDP, one percentage point below the spending share of 1980. Nonetheless, education

spending increased systematically over the
1990s and 2000s, as the Assembly approved
spending targets of six percent of GDP in
1997 (reached by 2009) and eight percent of
GDP in 2010 (projected to be reached by
2018).18 These levels of public spending as a
share of GDP are higher than the 5.4 percent
112

of GDP spent by OECD countries on
average.19
Education spending is in the “mid-range”
between middle-income and high-income
countries. Measuring education spending as a
share of GDP is useful for assessing its trend
over time, as well as its fiscal implications.
Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

However, when comparing with other countries, measuring per student spending as a
share of GDP per capita allows us to take into
consideration the country’s size and level of
development.20 With this adjusted measure,
Costa Rica spends relatively more than some
LAC countries and even on par with some
high-income countries (HICs) like Australia,
the Republic of Korea, Israel, or Singapore,
but relatively less than Brazil, Mexico, and
all other OECD countries (figure 5.12).
Moreover, compared to the high-performing
Scandinavian countries, Costa Rica spends
significantly less per student, even relative to
its much smaller GDP per capita. As discussed earlier, this investment in education
has translated into important achievements
in terms of literacy and primary education
attainment.
Costa Rica’s education expenditure favors
primary and tertiary, against spending on
secondary schooling. One-third of the

budget goes to tertiary education (­figure
5.13), which responds in part to the country’s pattern of growth and the shift towards
high-skilled, high value-added sectors and
also to the guaranteed allocation of the budget that is granted to autonomous public
universities. However, only 22 percent is allocated to secondary education, despite the
demographic transition (trending towards
fewer younger children) and the large skills
gap for completion of secondary education
(with over half of young adults dropping out
before completing high school, many of
them as early as seventh grade, as discussed
in chapter 3). Compared with other countries, both the share of public spending on
secondary and spending per secondaryschool student are low for Costa Rica, given
its level of development (figure 5.14).
As a result of high dropout rates at the
secondary level, public spending in education becomes regressive at higher levels.

Given that a larger share of children from
lower-income households drop out of secondary education, those who remain enrolled in the system and eventually access
tertiary education tend to come from middle- and upper-class households. As figure
5.15 shows, spending in tertiary education
goes mostly to upper-income quintiles, in
contrast to spending in primary, which is
more heavily directed to lower-income quintiles. Given that tertiary education is allocated 32 percent of the total education
budget, the result is a regressive system
where most Costa Rican households are subsidizing the education of a minority of welloff children.21
Given fiscal constraints, rising inequality, and the mismatch of skills and jobs,
Costa Rica needs to increase the efficiency
of spending with a focus on improving
114

quality and completion rates. As discussed
in chapter 3, the low results in school attain­
ment and quality are worrisome, given the
high share of spending on public education
and the shift in labor demand towards high-­
skilled labor. Thus, the solution is not to
spend more, but to spend better, by increas­
ing the efficiency of spending to achieve
better results. Some reform options are
dis­cussed in chapter 6.

Social protection spending, which includes
social security and social assistance, is high
by regional standards. Between 2007 and
2012 social protection spending rose from
7.3 percent of GDP to 8.5 percent of GDP
(left panel of figure 5.16). This is less than
what is spent in OECD countries (which
average 12.3 percent on old age and working age benefits),22 and is considerably
higher than in neighboring countries, such
as El Salvador (5 percent), Honduras (6.1
percent) or Panama (5.8 percent).23 The
largest share within social protection
spend­ing corresponds to social security
(that is, contributory pensions), whereas
social assistance spending represents only
1.1 percent of GDP, similar to the share in
Guatemala (1.1 percent), Nicaragua, and
Panama (0.9 percent) and below El Salvador (2.6 percent). During the crisis of 2009,
the government increased social protection
spending, particularly cash transfers,
which doubled in terms of GDP percentage
from 0.3 percent to 0.6 percent.24 All other
spending categories remained largely unchanged during the period (right panel of

Pension coverage is high, but different
pension regimes exacerbate inequities. A
look at pension coverage among the elderly
reveals that, though not universal, coverage
is rather large for LAC standards.25 Indeed,
by 2013, 58 percent of the elderly in the
bottom income quintile received a pension
(of which 40 percent was non-contributory), and 67 percent of the elderly in the
top quintile also received a pension (where
64 percent were contributory pensions).
Thus, two-thirds of the elderly receive some
form of pension, and there is very little inequality in terms of coverage across income
quintiles (figure 5.17). Yet, the elderly poor
are much more likely to receive non-contributory pensions, which are clearly smaller
than contributory pensions. Moreover,
among those that receive contributory pensions, there is a stark difference between
pensioners of the public sector and private
sector regimes. The special regimes (now
mostly closed to current workers) pay significantly more generous benefits than

those provided by the CCSS for the general
population. This is not only a source of inequity but also raises sustainability questions, as discussed in the previous section.
At the same time, social assistance transfers have had limited effects on poverty and
inequality due to low coverage of the poor.
This is explained by the fact that most social
assistance programs in Costa Rica have fairly
low coverage among the poor. As figure 5.18
shows, even the most widespread program
(school meals) reaches only half of the population in the lowest income quintile; and
the second largest program, the conditional
cash transfer program Avancemos, reaches
only 28 percent. In addition, there exist a
large number of programs, whose coverage
is not documented in the household survey
ENAHO and that reach a very small number
of beneficiaries (fewer than 20 thousand in
most cases).
Moreover, most major social assistance
programs are not well targeted. As the top
panel of figure 5.19 shows, even the “best” targeted programs, such as the non-contributory
pension, have about half of their beneficiaries
in the bottom quintile. At the other end, a
program like school meals provides most of
its benefits to non-poor children, and a similar situation occurs with training programs
from INA (Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje,
National Learning Institute). Putting Costa
Rica in an international context (bottom panel
of figure 5.19) reveals that there is significant
room for improving the targeting accuracy of
its programs. For example, 74 percent of cash
transfers in the CCT Red de Oportunidades of
Panama (one of Costa Rica’s structural peers)
go to the poorest quintile, against 44 percent
for Avancemos. Thus, it is unclear how effective Costa Rica’s programs can be to help the
poor (and especially the poorest) bridge the

gaps created by low human capital and low access to jobs.
Furthermore, social assistance is widely
seen as “welfare assistance” instead of a
­system to lift people out of poverty. Despite
a broad political and social support for social programs for the poor, there is a common view both in the government and in
the society, that social programs are not effective in generating capabilities that would
enable people to escape poverty. They are
rather seen as a retaining wall that prevents
further increases of poverty, especially during crises, as seems to be the case with some
programs like the CCT Avancemos (figure
5.20), but they have little impact on overall poverty. Yet, many social programs
were conceived expressly to boost income-­
generating capabilities. This is the case of
all school support programs (school meals,
Fondo Nacional de Becas (National Scholarship Fund, FONABE) scholarships, and
Avancemos), but also of the early childhood

programs (Red de Cuido/CEN-CINAI), the
housing programs (BAHNVI), and other
smaller training and entrepreneurship programs. The lack of a culture of evaluation
and social accountability within the social
sector (and beyond) has contributed to
the view that social programs have “no
­impact” and that they only serve as basic
safety nets. In the long term, this can undermine the legitimacy and the public support
for them.
Finally, a significant challenge for the efficiency and effectiveness of the social protection system is its fragmentation and insti­​
tutional complexity. Institutional arrangements in the management and financing of
social programs are highly complex. Before
funds can be used by an implementing
agency (for example IMAS (Joint Institute
for Social Assistance), they flow through
various channels, in particular FODESAF
(National Development and Family Allocations Fund, run by the Ministry of Labor),
which distributes funds from the central
government to various programs, based on
an allocation formula set by law. The resulting earmarking makes budget allocation inflexible; and because more than 50 percent
of FODESAF’s budget is earmarked, it is difficult to track financial flows and to assess
the cost effectiveness of programs.26

Sustaining the Green

Costa Rica is regarded as a world
leader in conservation and has made significant achievements in reforestation. Over
119

the last 30 years, forest cover has increased
from 26 percent to 52 percent (figure 5.21).
This has been made possible through public
and private engagement and the use of economic incentives for conservation (under
the 1996 Forest Law and its Payment for
Environment Services [PES] framework),
which have served as important drivers for

promoting forest conservation, reforestation, and afforestation (chapter 1, box 1.2).
These have proven critical to Costa Rica’s
development strategy, given the country’s
recognition as an international ecotourism
desti­nation. The tourism industry generated
income of US$2.3 billion in 2013, representing around 44 percent of total service

Knowledge gap 5.1 How Can Costa Rica Improve the Effectiveness
and Coordination of its Social Programs?
Social policy is fragmented across numerous institutions in Costa Rica, many of them
autonomous agencies. Consequently, more than two dozen social programs operate in
parallel, often with similar target groups. What is the mapping of social programs by
agency, objectives, coverage, and performance? How can these duplications (and resulting
gaps in coverage for some population groups) be reduced, either through consolidation of
programs, integration of Social Registries (such as the SIPO, operated by IMAS, and the
SINIRUBE [National System of Registration of Beneficiaries], operated by FODESAF), or
more ambitious institutional consolidation? This is the topic of a new non-lending technical assistance being requested by the Government of Costa Rica.

Knowledge gap 5.2 How Can Costa Rica Link Sustainable Production
and Rural Landscapes to its Conservation Model?
Costa Rica’s well-known Green Trademark has been centered on a conservation approach,
supported by public sector economic incentives for conservation and reforestation (the
PES mechanism) and eco-tourism resources. Fiscal and economic pressures, as well as
scope, bring into question the sustainability of that model. How can Costa Rica adapt to
the next generation of the green agenda, going beyond conservation and nature protection
towards innovative ways for mainstreaming conservation into productive landscapes,
and beyond carbon neutrality towards resilience? Further work under the programmatic
NLTA on Green and Inclusive Growth seeks to bring further evidence to this important
policy question.

exports or 19 percent of merchandise exports (chapter 4). Approximately 40 percent
of tourists visited national parks. Costa Rica
continues to strive for “green” leadership
with its international commitment in 2009
(at the UN Summit on Climate Change) to
become a carbon neutral nation by 2021
(chapter 1, box 1.2).
However, its Green Trademark and its
commitment to carbon neutrality are at
risk. Being green and carbon neutral at the
same time entails not only maintaining the
current levels of forest cover, but also reducing the current levels of Greenhouse
Gas (GHG) emissions from all sectors. This
is a challenging task given the trade-offs
built into the current economic incentive
structure for forest conservation and reforestation, which is dependent on revenues generated from tax on gasoline. While
a large share of GHG emissions can be reduced through better management of forested and agricultural land, the country
also needs to reduce carbon emissions
from fossil fuels coming from transport,
Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

construction, and increasingly from general electricity consumption.27
The current environmental regulatory
framework favors a strong conservation approach that has limited productive opportunities. During the last four decades, the focus
on conservation has led to the development
of a nature-based tourism sector, on the one
hand, and a significant contraction of the domestic timber industry, on the other. Costa
Rica has become a net importer of processed
and finished wood products, such as furniture.28 As the demand for wood and processed
timber has been steadily increasing over the
last decade, underinvestment in the timber industry has led to a 36.4 percent drop in output
of processed timber between 2007 and 2012
and an increase in the exports of low-value
unprocessed products (such as palettes [tarimas], construction material, sawn wood). Agricultural productivity of many of Costa Rica’s
main crops has also seen a declining trend
(coffee, in particular) (chapter 4), which affects
the livelihood of rural populations engaged in
agriculture. The focus on conser­vation has also
121

limited the country’s potential to meet increasing energy needs through renewable energy
generation (such as hydropower, geothermal,
and biomass), which would require the exploitation of resources located within the
boundaries of protected areas.
Efforts to maintain or further increase
the forest cover are undermined by rising
opportunity costs. The fiscal weight of
Costa Rica’s conservation and reforestation
program can prove too heavy to sustain in
the longer term, with more pressing social
and economic issues that the country faces
in the short term and an increasing opportunity cost of alternative land-use options.
More profitable non-traditional export crops
such as pineapples, bananas, or oil palm are
becoming more economically attractive,
with land owners opting out of the conservation and reforestation programs once the
contracts are phased out. Although these
activities generate employment in rural areas,

they may jeopardize Costa Rica’s achievements in countering deforestation trends
and promoting a green image, unless land
use change is adequately managed and potential negative environmental externalities
(such as heavy use of agro-chemicals—see
figure 5.22) are internalized through effective mechanisms (such as organic production). If in the medium to long term Costa
Rica wants to continue increasing or maintaining its current forest cover, the regulatory framework governing its management
and associated incentives needs to be reviewed and adapted to a growth strategy
that considers the role of forest conservation in the context of a rural productive
space that is increasingly vulnerable to
weather changes.
Moreover, rapid urbanization has brought
new challenges for the country. Costa Rica’s
urban population has been growing rapidly,
from 50 percent of the total population in

1990 to 75 percent in 2013. The first challenge relates to the transportation area and
associated carbon emissions and air pollution. Increasing energy demand is boosting
the use of fossil fuels and raising air pollution levels, mainly through a significant increase in road-based transport. Growing
and aging vehicle fleets and increased congestion are key drivers, especially in the San
José Greater Metropolitan Area (GMA).29
Energy subsidies, especially for transport
fuels, further magnify this development by
incentivizing inefficient use of vehicles.
However, the public transportation system
in the GMA is obsolete (all routes converge
to the city center) and contributes to gridlock. The economic costs of urban air pollution in Costa Rica amount to about CRC
210 billion (about one percent of GDP).
Around 350 premature deaths and close to
4,700 lost Disability-Adjusted Life Years
(DALY) are attributable to urban air pollution (Particulate Matter (PM) exposure).
The second set of challenges emerging from
urbanization includes sewage treatment and

solid-waste management. Although access
to sanitation is almost universal (chapter 3),
96 percent of all urban wastewater collected
is discharged into rivers and receiving water
bodies without any treatment, generating
public health risks and water resources contamination (figure 5.23). Only eight percent
of the population is connected to a sewage
system and to a wastewater treatment plant.
In San José, only four out of 16 wastewater
treatment plants comply with state regulations. The water contamination has been
so severe in some cases as to result in five
beaches being declared unsuitable for
swimmers (Quepos, Azul, Tarcoles, Portete,
and Balneario municipal de Limon).30
Mounting unmanaged solid waste has consequences for public health and the sustainability of the green model. In sum, an
emerging area of environmental sustainability is the brown agenda.
The country is also highly exposed to natural hazards and faces significant challenges
from climate change. Costa Rica is one of
the countries with the highest exposure to

hazards, including hydro-meteorological
(floods, cyclones, and landslides) and geophysical (earthquakes and volcanoes).31 It is
the second most exposed country to multiple
hazards based on land area, with 36.8 percent
of the total area exposed to three or more
natural hazards. It is estimated that 77.9 per­
cent of the population and 80.1 percent of
GDP are subject to high risk from multiple
hazards. While Costa Rica has been spared
by major disasters in recent years, it is not
immune to the potential of a catastrophic
event. Hurricane Thomas in 2010 caused
damages estimated at US$292 million; Tropical Depression 12E in 2011 caused US$60
million in damages; and in 2012 the SamaraGuanacaste earthquake generated US$100
million in damages to public buildings,
transport, health, education, and water and
sanitation infrastructure. Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel
of Climate Change (IPCC), some of the climate change projections for Costa Rica indicate up to a 32 percent decrease in overall
rainfall precipitation by 2050. Some areas,
especially in the North, have recently seen
more frequent and prolonged drought periods. Changes in storm regimes near the
coast may further erode coastal morphology,
disrupt fishing areas and agricultural lands,
and salinize water sources.32
Increasing urbanization and vulnerability of public infrastructure are two factors
contributing to risk exposure. The San Jose
GMA’s fast-­growing population puts pressure on the limited natural resources and
on public goods and services. Affordable
housing is a major socioeconomic constraint (see chapter 3) that forces many
low-income families to relocate to higher-­
risk areas. In fact, most of the people affected by disasters such as floods live in
124

informal urban settlements.33 On the public infrastructure side, low levels of investment in disaster risk reduction are putting
critical transport infrastructure at risk of
failure in the event of a disaster. An illustrative example is the need to replace and
retrofit the bridges most crucial for transport and most vulnerable to seismic and
hydro-­meteorological events. Of all the
damages due to hydro-meteorological events
between 2005 and 2010, 51.6 percent were
recorded in the transport sector.
Strengthening prevention and resilience
is complicated by low capacity of local governments. Even though national policies for
Disaster Risk Management (DRM) exist at
the national level, a major constraint in the
process of generating more knowledge and
increasing preparation is the level of local
technical capacity to absorb information
and implement the right measures.34 For example, the capabilities to use and process
information vary widely across municipalities: only a few have the right human and
infrastructure resources, such as sophisticated mapping systems. As a result, overall
resilience and adaptation to climate-induced
impacts has yet to be achieved at local
levels.
Sustaining and promoting a Green Trademark needs to extend beyond forest conservation and reforestation. The “green” asset
that Costa Rica has established with its forests
can be maintained only through an integrated
approach that enables the conservation of
natural resources to be developed in parallel
to other productive activities and balances
the many financial and environmental tradeoffs. This has been achieved in other countries, such as New Zealand and Finland,
where the “green” image is supported with
strong forestry and agricultural sectors and a
Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

risk preparedness framework. However, the
challenge in Costa Rica will be to find the
right balance, if any, between “green” and carbon neutral while addressing increasing issues in the brown agenda in the country.

Governance Challenges
Hamper Government
Effectiveness and
Regulatory Growth35
Despite Costa Rica’s good standing on
governance relative to the LAC region, both
perceptions and evidence suggest that its institutions and procedures have not been able
to adapt to the challenges of a new economic
and social environment. Costa Rica has better governance indicators than LAC, but lags
behind OECD countries (figure 5.24). After
the 1948 civil war, the abolition of the army,
and the creation of the new Constitution
in 1949, Costa Rica became an exemplary

democracy, with a clear checks and balances
system between the executive and the legislative (Assembly). Since 1953, elections have
been peaceful and citizen participation in
the political process is high (chapter 1).
Costa Rica also has high marks in the areas
of voice and accountability and control of
corruption. The areas of government effectiveness and regulatory quality are the ones
trailing behind, with the largest difference
with OECD countries.
The current political landscape poses additional challenges for approving and implementing needed reforms. Costa Rica’s
legislative power has gradually shifted from
a bi-partisan to a multi-party system, hampering the adoption of reforms in many instances over the past ­decade(s) (­figure 5.25).
Parliamentary procedures, which historically did not impede decision making, give
political minorities the power to delay votes
or to file injunctions, which, in a fragmented
and polarized environment, seems to be
hampering reform processes.36 One example

is the fiscal reform package that was approved by the Legislative Assembly, and
later invalidated by the Constitutional
Court following an injunction filed by a legislator. The leadership, in drafting new legislation, has also shifted slightly from the
executive to the legislative, partly a reflection of parliamentary procedures. For example, during the Chinchilla administration
(2010–2014), most of the new legislation
passed originated in the Arias administration (2006–2010). Paradoxically, the Chinchilla government experienced the most
difficulty in passing comprehensive reforms
in the Assembly during its first two years,
when the political capital would seemingly
be the highest.37 During the second half of
the term, the “wear and tear” of parliamentary negotiations manifested itself, and the
magnitude of the new legislation passed
also diminished. The delays and difficulty in
passing comprehensive and meaningful reforms result in a mismatch between the
“political delivery” and the demands of the
126

population. Finally, in the absence of clear
political leadership and consensus, new interpretations of the existing laws take the
place of passing new laws.
A consequence of this gridlock in passing reforms has been the proliferation of an
increasing number of public (and often autonomous) institutions created to address
specific problems. Costa Rica is notorious in
Latin America for the large number of public institutions. In 2011, the state comprised
324 entities (table 5.1), followed by El Salvador with only 162. Many of these institutions were born out of a desire to make the
government apparatus more efficient and
agile—typically through the creation of “autonomous institutions,” which are run under
different regulations from the Central Government and have a separate budget process
(more on this below). Also, these institutions usually have much more generous pay
scales than the Central Government, but the
same level of job security, and no real performance evaluation mechanisms. In the

last two decades, more public entities were
created than in the entire period 1950–1979.
Between 1990 and 2009, 118 were founded
or restructured. Over time, these new bodies are affecting the government’s efficiency
(and service ­delivery), thus reinforcing the
vicious cycle that leads to the creation of
new institutions. In some cases, some institutional clusters have been effective in
achieving positive outcomes (for example,
the attraction of FDI and tourism development discussed earlier); but in others there
are failures, too, the most salient one being
the case of the rice sector (box 5.1). With 28
institutions, the agricultural sector provides
an example of the fragmentation of institutions that hinders the coordination and effectiveness of policies, decision-making, and
quality of services for producers.38 As long
as public sector action is needed to provide
services to foster growth, modernizing the
public sector becomes a needed foundation
that will impact all aspects of the economy.
Besides the proliferation of institutions,
current procurement practices are not conducive to an effective control of resources.
Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

Current public procurement practices fail to
consolidate purchases (taking advantage of
framework agreements, for example) or
standard bidding documents, both of which
could lead to important cost savings. Also,
neither the public sector entity nor the government makes good use of existing information technology to plan, manage, or
control procurement. In many cases, precise
purchasing statistics are not available and
there are only weak links between procurement plans, the budget process, and various
aspects of the financial management at the
budget execution stage. In addition, within
this overall legal and oversight framework,
each public sector entity is free to set its procurement rules and procedures, making it
difficult to do centralized planning or to
consolidate purchases across institutions.
This absence of complete statistics on procurement and procurement methods makes
it difficult to identify patterns, learn from
mistakes, carry out performance evaluation,
and design efficient procurement policies.
Another complexity of the intricate public sector administration is the budget and
127

Box 5.1 The Rice Sector: Failure of a Productive Development Policy
Rice, a staple item in the food basket of the poor, is one of the most protected commodities
in Costa Rica. Rice tariffs in Costa Rica are high, at 62 percent for processed rice (having
recently increased from 35 percent), and prices for locally produced rice are controlled at
each step of the process. Rice subsidies (in the form of guaranteed prices), amount to 45
percent of the domestic price, higher than in the United States or the European Union
(EU). Ironically, the policies that protect rice prices under a banner of food security and
equity have brought them well above international prices, benefiting a handful of large
producers and harming the budget of the poor.
The Corporación Arrocera Nacional (CONARROZ), created in 2002, has been effective in
protecting producers from international price shocks, but not in improving local production conditions. CONARROZ gathers a very diverse set of rice producers and processors,
most of them very small producers. Its lobbying efforts are presented as a way of defending these small producers and protecting jobs in the agricultural sector. However, most
of the rice produced in Costa Rica (about 80 percent) comes from a minority of large
producers and processors, who also benefit from tariff-free import quotas (assigned
proportionally to their processing capacity). Thus, they can purchase rice at international
market prices, and sell the processed rice domestically with a high profit. It is estimated
that from 1995 to 2005, consumers transferred US$396 million to rice producers, which
for the poorest households represents seven to eight percent of their per capita income.
Price controls have done little to improve productivity among rice producers but have
created incentives to maintain the status quo. Although consumer prices have continuously increased since 2008, producer prices have remained flat or decreased, mostly due to
low quality. The average yield per hectare has gone down from 4.8 tons in 1999/2000 to
3.39 tons in 2011/2012. As a result, most domestic rice producers, particularly the smaller
ones, would not be profitable at international prices, and thus have a strong interest to
maintain the status quo.

planning system. The current budget system
limits the ability to have a comprehensive
discussion on policy and spending priorities.39 Costa Rica has three distinct budgetary
processes in the public sector. First, the central government budget or national budget,
which is approved by the legislative assembly.
Second, the budgetary process of the
128

institutions outside the central government,
whose budget is approved by the Comptroller
General of the Republic (CGR), and which
doubles the size of the national budget. Of
the total public sector budget, the national
budget is about 33 percent, and the budget of
other institutions is 66 percent.40 The third
budget process is for municipality budgets,

Box 5.2 The CCSS Lacks an Integrated Management System Over
Resources
In terms of budget, the Costa Rican Social Security Institute (Caja Costarricense de Seguro
Social, CCSS) is the largest decentralized autonomous entity in the Government. Its
annual budget of about US$5.6 billion
for 2015 is equivalent to 37 percent of
the Central Government Budget.
SS: Accounting ProcessCycle

The CCSS’ operational processes are
characterized by complex and cumbersome procedures. They rely on a
“silo” approach that favors fragmentation and duplication of many processes paired with multiple layers of
approvals. Moreover, the fragmentation of processes has resulted in the
development and use of multiple nonlinked IT tools (including Excel sheets
and databases) for the recording, control, and generation of different pieces of information.
The information generated by these independent IT tools needs to be aggregated and
reconciled. In a highly decentralized environment, having excessive manual controls is not
effective and has consequences in terms of added transaction costs and difficulties in
producing information that could assist with service delivery.

The preparation of financial statements provides a good example of the challenges that
CCSS faces to adequately monitor the use of its resources. Information from over 20 IT
systems and databases is manually collected and aggregated Because these systems and
databases are not linked, the CCSS has developed burdensome and manual reconciliations
across the organization, as well as additional manual controls, in order to ensure that
errors are prevented or detected in a timely manner. The lack of an integrated IT platform
does not allow the timely and systematic recording of financial and accounting transactions. While these manual and compensating controls allow for the timely preparation of
budgetary reports and financial statements (including budget monitoring, reconciliations
of accounts, analyses of fluctuations, aging of accounts, and manual and supervisory
reviews), given the nature of the CCSS more meaningful financial information—such as
financial information by service delivery units or by cost centers—might be needed to
support decision-making and monitoring financial performance.

which account for less than two percent of
public sector expenditures. The CGR verifies
the legality of proposed expenditures by the
municipalities. Thus, a large part of public
expenditures is not under the direct control
of the executive or the legislative powers.41
The latest PEFA assessment (World Bank and
IDB 2010), found that only 49.6 percent of
expenditures were approved by the Congress
and in 2011 the central government accounted for only 41 percent of expenditures
and 27 out of a total of 229 entities.42
The budget process and numerous earmarked expenditures reduce the margin for
the executive to control public investment
and current expenses. Budgets are increasingly constrained by constitutional mandates and rules without corresponding
financing, such as directives on minimum
spending for education, municipalities,
housing subsidies, and community development. Additional laws stipulate that portions of taxes and fees must be allocated to
certain activities and institutions, such as
FODESAF (National Development and
Family Allocations Fund) and CONAVI
(National Roads Authority). Pensions, wages,
and salaries account for three-­quarters of
central government expenditures. Public
sector employment is much higher in Costa
Rica than in most other Latin American
countries, comprising 14.4 percent of the
labor force in 2012 compared to an average
of 10.9 percent (figure 5.26). Public sector
wages are also significantly higher than the
private sector ones (see chapter 5, figure
5.5). Moreover, the central government tax
revenue is still insufficient to fund all these
legal and constitutional mandates. A World
Bank Public Expenditure Review finds that
“in order not to exceed spending limits and
given these rigidities, the government has
130

often resorted to cutting back on public investment, putting pressure on service delivery. One of the most evident results of
public investments restrictions is the deterioration in the quality of most of Costa
Rica’s infrastructure services.”43 More important, the executive has no power to direct or contain spending in autonomous
institutions, since they operate with wide
margins of budgetary and administrative
independence, and are constitutionally
protected from political interference or
changes in government.
Moreover, sectorial planning is weak
with limited medium-term costing projections. Annual work plans are developed at
the institution level despite a provision
made in Law 8131 to develop multi-annual
plans at the sectorial level (multi-institutional). The PEFA (ID-11 iii) shows a very
weak environment for sectorial planning.
More analysis will be needed to fully understand the consequences of weak sectorial
planning coupled with increased number of
institutions (including special purpose institutions, executive agencies) on service delivery, but clearly a fragmented planning
system is not conducive to improving the
quality of public expenditures.
The main effect of weaknesses in public
sector administration is on the diminished
ability of the public sector to deliver services
expected by the population and private sector. Agencies affected are those in charge of
education, health, public infrastructure, and
social assistance, which have a direct effect on
the inclusiveness of growth. Not surprising,
there is a growing perception of low effectiveness of government institutions and civil servants. According to a 2011 Latinobarómetro
study, Costa Rica was rated by its own citizens
at 5.5 out of 10 on the efficiency of the

Knowledge gap 5.3 What Are the Key Governance Bottlenecks in
Executing Infrastructure Projects—and What are Their Cost Implications?
Various factors are named as obstacles to implementation of public infrastructure and
social projects in the various line ministries, such as cumbersome processes in the Public
Procurement Law, deficiencies in the environmental regulatory framework, cumbersome
checks and reviews by the Contraloria, and deficiencies in the expropriations law. Further
evidence on the trajectory of investment projects—and the time delays and costs of each
step along the way—would help inform the debate about how to reduce the “chokes and
strangleholds” on public investment in Costa Rica.

that increase the transaction costs of interacting with public institutions and decrease
the quality of services. The poor ranking of
Costa Rica in the Doing Business Indicators
(see figure 4.28) is partly attributed to burdensome procedures within and between
public institutions. Reducing red tape will
facilitate firms’ operations, reducing transaction costs of interacting with public institutions. Only one quarter of firms report

that red tape declined in 2014.44 Small and
medium enterprises are the most affected
by red tape. Firms in the FTZs depend on
CINDE to expedite solutions for complying
with business regulations. Furthermore, the
quality and efficiency of public services can
be affected by cumbersome procedures.
In sum, we find that the public sector has
moved very slowly to adapt to the increasing
sophistication and needs of the economy.

6. Priority Areas, Linkages, and
Complementarities
Costa Rica’s development model has
sustained impressive achievements. Centered
on its long-standing democracy, ambitious
Social Compact, open economy model, and
Green Trademark, the country has sustained
healthy growth rates, improvements in social
indicators, environmental gains, and one of
the lowest poverty rates in the Latin America
and Caribbean (LAC) region.
However, despite these impressive
achieve­ments, there are a number of emerging challenges that will need to be addressed
to main­tain the country’s successful development path.
First, despite reasonable growth and a
strong commitment to the Social Compact,
poverty reduction has stagnated and inequality is rising. The long-term trend suggests rising or stagnating inequality across most of the
past 25 years, in stark contrast to the significant decline in inequality in the broader LAC
region. More recently, the gap between the
rich and poor has widened significantly since
the global crisis. Although growth recovered
promptly after the global crisis, above the regional average, job creation for low-skilled
workers has been feeble, contributing to rising unemployment and pushing returns to
higher education upwards. Growth has been
uneven, with lower growth and job creation
in sectors that are more likely to employ unskilled workers (e.g., construction and agriculture). Not surprisingly, inequality has
increased, with the widening gap between the
earnings of rich and poor workers mirroring
large disparities in human capital and

Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities

educational attainment. Moreover, despite
high spending on social protection benefits
and the broader Social Compact, taxes and
transfers have not proven to be effective in redistributing income to compensate for these
disparities. Consequently, rising inequality
offset the poverty-reducing impact of growth
in the late 2000s, and reversed what should
have been a decline in poverty between 2010
and 2014, with poverty increasing by 0.4 percentage points instead of falling by a projected
three percentage points during the post-­crisis
“recovery” period.
Second, although GDP has grown steadily
in recent years, especially compared to the
Latin American Region as a whole, Costa
Rica performance is not comparable to the
top regional performers. Unlike the top regional performers (Chile, Panama, and
­Uruguay) Costa Rica’s per capita GDP had
not shown any signs of convergence towards
the US level in the last 25 years. For example,
in 1990, Costa Rica per capita income was
13 percent of the US level, approximately as
it is today. At the same time, the per capita
GDP of Chile, Panama, and Uruguay have
increased form 13, 12 and 9 percent of the
US per capita GDP in 1990 to 21, 17 and
17 percent today respectively. Production
costs that weaken the country’s competitiveness prevent Costa Rica from joining the top
growth performers. These productions costs
are affected by relatively high wages that
limit the country competitiveness in low
value added sectors, as well as by a number
of investment-climate related factors such as

135

rising electricity costs, weak infrastructure,
and burdensome regulations.
And third, fiscal pressures threaten to undermine the sustainability of the country’s
Social Compact and Green Trademark, and
prevent it from undertaking much needed
investments in public infrastructure. Without fiscal consolidation, the deficit could
push public debt to unsustainable levels and
threaten the country’s economic, social, and
environmental gains. The fiscal situation has
deteriorated substantially since the global
crisis, with the overall deficit of the Central
Government growing to 5.6 percent of GDP
in 2013, and is projected to have surpassed
six percent in 2014 and to reach 6.6 in 2015.
In tandem, public debt increased from 25
percent of GDP in 2008 to 37 percent in
2013, with projections of 63 percent by 2019
unless corrective measures are implemented. This recent deterioration stems
from counter-cyclical measures under-taken
during the crisis and structural forces that
will require actions on multiple fronts.
Moreover, the current political landscape
and institutional framework add an additional layer of complexity for approving and
implementing key reforms needed to address
these emerging challenges. The shift from a
two-party to a multi-party system in the last
fifteen years has resulted in more complex
and lengthy reform processes. The delays and
difficulties in passing comprehensive and
meaningful reforms, particularly on sensitive
issues such as tax reform, has resulted in a
mismatch between the demands of the population and the “political delivery”. This is an
increasing concern given the growing need to
react and adapt quickly to changing global
developments. Likewise, capacity constraints,
related to weak sectoral planning and bureaucratic inefficiencies, also affect the ability of
136

the public sector to implement policies and
execute public investment projects.
Several threads weave across this “trilogy” of challenges for inclusion, growth,
and ­sustainability—and point to priority
areas for action. One thread involves the interactions between inequality and growth,
which hinge on the mismatch of skills and
jobs. Another strand is the dual challenge of
maintaining competitiveness of high value-added sectors, while enhancing the viability of traditional low value-added sectors.
Mounting fiscal pressures threaten the sustainability of the Social Compact and Green
Trademark. Finally, the challenges of governance also weave across the development
agenda, limiting the capacity of the public
sector to adopt reforms, deliver services,
and execute infrastructure projects. These
inter-­connected challenges highlight a
number of priority areas that Costa Rica
needs to address to continue on a sustainable and inclusive growth path.
These links highlight a number of complementary priority areas for Costa Rica to continue on a sustainable and inclusive growth
path. As in other countries, the list of policy
areas that could potentially help make progress toward poverty reduction and shared
prosperity is long. Through a combination of
diagnostics, benchmarking, and internal and
external consultations, this Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) refines the long list to
identify a set of cross-cutting areas with
strong linkages and complementarities. These
include: strengthening the education and
training systems, boosting competitiveness
and reducing the infrastructure deficit,
strength­ening governance, and undertaking a
variety of measures to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal situation, the Social Compact,
and the Green Trademark (figure 6.1).

trajectory towards a high value-added
economy and to reduce the skills-income
gap. With fewer than half of young adults
graduating from secondary school, and
with performance on test scores falling,
Costa Rica’s labor supply does not appear
to be well adapted to generate the skills
needed for the labor market. Thus, building
a more skilled workforce will ensure that
the country remains competitive in high
Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities

value-added sectors, and that more workers
can access these better paying jobs, including those in the bottom 40 percent of the
population. As these changes are structural,
for the most part they are also long term in
nature. Workers cannot just “acquire an
­education overnight.” As such, tackling
these challenges will require a three-pronged
approach: (i) strengthening the quality, retention, and relevance of the education system (from pre-school through secondary
school)—which will help build the skills of
137

“tomorrow’s workers”; (ii) improving the
quality and relevance of tertiary education;
and (iii) strengthening the technical training system for the workforce.
Bold actions are needed to overhaul
Costa Rica’s education system. Given the
country’s level of development and high education spending, the education system seriously underperforms in quality (as
demon­strated by test results), retention (low
completion rates), and relevance (as indicated by low returns to training and lower
levels of education). Although high rates of
secondary school dropout are a symptom of
the broader challenges in the system, imbalances in the allocation of public spending
favor primary (41 percent) and tertiary education (32 percent) with relatively little allocated to the secondary level (27 percent).
Indeed, both the share of public spending
and the allocation per student in secondary
education are low by international standards and given Costa Rica’s level of development. Moreover, inequities in learning
outcomes start early in life—and affect motivation and abilities to learn throughout
the school years. In addition to rebalancing
spending towards secondary school and
early childhood devel­opment, Costa Rica
needs to strengthen teacher quality and improve accountability through regular monitoring with standardized learning
assessments, and a more effective governance and incentive framework.
Given the high-skilled profile of job opportunities in Costa Rica, systemic efforts are
also needed to enhance the quality and relevance of tertiary education. Currently, the
tertiary education system is heavily biased towards social science and humanities, and
produces few STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics) graduates,
138

further contributing to the skills shortage in
high value-added sectors. Moreover, outdated
and bureaucratic procedures for recognizing
foreign degrees create obstacles for Costa
Rica to “import” the skills needed to sustain
its high value-added growth model. Quality
and accountability mechanisms are also
needed, with performance agreements with
public universities and quality accreditation
standards for both university and non-university tertiary education.
Finally, the country needs to expand the
offering and relevance of technical training,
which is the most direct way to build the
skills of the current workforce. Again, stronger quality standards, certification of technical programs, and accountability of training
institutes could help. The National Learning
Institute (INA) could also improve coordination with private-sector employers to design market-relevant curricula and course
offerings so as to better respond to the needs
of the growing sectors of the economy.
Competitiveness and the business climate. Boosting growth and inclusion in
the labor market requires confronting the
dual challenge of maintaining competitiveness of high value-added sectors, while improving the viability of low value-added
sectors. For instance, improving the integration of export-oriented and domestic firms
through backward linkages could sustain the
growth among small and medium enterprises (SMEs), generating jobs in mid- and
low-skilled occupations. This can be done by
lowering operation costs to improve the productivity of labor and counterbalance the
high labor costs in Costa Rica compared to
its neighbors, for example by lowering the
costs of doing business through regulatory
simplification.
Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities

Infrastructure. Reducing the infrastructure deficit would increase competitiveness,
growth, and environmental sustainability.
Costa Rica’s historical efforts to build an extensive network of infrastructure in nearly
all productive service areas (water, sanitation, transport, electricity, and telecommunications) are clear from the infrastructure
stock: the country has two times the road
and three times the rail density of the average middle-income country; access to electricity is nearly universal; and mobile
penetration is higher than the OECD average. Yet, the near freeze in public infrastructure investment until the 1990s, as well as
recent fiscal constraints, have taken a toll on
the country’s ability to upgrade and maintain
its infrastructure. Further, the government
has faced significant challenges in executing
infrastructure investment in a timely manner. As a result, today roads and ports have
among the lowest quality marks in the LAC
region. Electricity prices have doubled since
2007 due to weather related variable hydroelectric output, causing increased use of
thermal units and high operating costs,
among other factors. This infrastructure deficit reduces the potential of local firms to
grow and create jobs, and this is true in particular for firms that operate outside Free
Trade Zones (FTZs). In addition, the country needs to improve its waste management
and clean energy production capabilities to
be able to reduce GHG emissions, and water
and soil pollution. Infrastructure improvement poses a number of tradeoffs, including
the need to intervene in protected areas (in
the case of clean energy production), as well
as the need to control the current fiscal deficit. Given the necessity of continuing to invest in infrastructure, and the reality of fiscal
constraints, Costa Rica must look for options
Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities

for private sector participation in the maintenance and upgrading of its infrastructure.
Both growth and inclusion would benefit
from the many complementarities involved
in improving education, competitiveness,
and infrastructure. A well-educated workforce with relevant skills is fundamental for
sustaining economic growth and increasing
productivity. In parallel, closing the education gap between the poor and non-poor is
also highly relevant for inclusion by providing opportunities those in the bottom
40 percent. Lowering the costs of doing business will boost competitiveness across various sectors. Furthermore, increasing
infrastructure spending would stimulate
construction, thereby creating more jobs for
the large stock of low-skilled workers.
At the same time, actions are needed to
ensure the sustainability of Costa Rica’s
­development model:
•

Fiscal Sustainability: Improving the fiscal
stance to restore sustainability requires
reforms to manage expenditures and
increase revenues. On the expenditure
front, these include containing the wage
bill of the consolidated public sector, as
public sector wages, both in government
and more so in state-owned enterprises
and other public institutions, are well
above the private sector at all employment categories; and reviewing the fiscal
sustainability of the pension system,
particularly of special pension regimes
in the public sector. In addition, a comprehensive reform of the budgetary
process is needed to increase efficiency
and transparency in all public sector
entities. Finally, curtailing the earmarking of revenues, which cover more than
half of primary spending, would make
139

•

•

140

the budgetary process more flexible.
Comprehensive reforms are also needed
to increase revenues. For example, the
1,259 tax exemptions approved since
1953 that comprise almost six percent
of GDP need to be thoroughly reviewed.
Curtailing those exemptions would
make the tax system more rational and
progressive, as well as produce higher
revenues. This reform is essential for
restoring sustainability to the fiscal accounts, which is a necessary condition
for achieving Costa Rica’s economic and
social objectives.
Social Sustainability: In addition to
strengthening education, priority areas
for sustaining the Social Compact including health and social protection.
Costa Rica needs to modernize its universal health system to improve quality
by: (i) strengthening the health care
model to enhance capacity to adapt
to demographic and epidemiological
change while ensuring quality and
timeliness of service delivery; (ii) improving the financial model of budget
and resource allocation; and (iii) improving the management model for the
health system for accountability, efficiency, and performance. The country
also needs to increase the effectiveness
of social protection programs by (i) har­
monizing eligibility criteria and social
information systems; (ii) improving
performance monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) reducing institutional
and program fragmentation.
Environmental Sustainability: To sustain
its celebrated “Green Trademark,” Costa
Rica needs to balance environmental
and natural resource management goals,
by: (i) reviewing the sustainability of

the PES mechanism for conservation;
(ii) ­modernizing water and solid waste
treatment (infrastructure, service delivery, regulatory framework, capacity);
(iii) increasing the supply of renewable
energy by making regulations on the use
of protected areas more flexible; (iv) implementing a comprehensive transport
policy, including measures to reduce
growth of demand for energy ­associated
with transport; (v) reinforcing regulation
and oversight of agro-chemical use and
incentivizing the expansion of “green”
(organic) agriculture; and (vi) improving
territorial planning, land management,
and management of natural and manmade disasters.
Governance. Progress in all the priority areas
discussed above hinges on improving the capacity of the public sector to plan and implement policies, execute public investment
projects, deliver services, and increase account­
ability. Despite Costa Rica’s good governance
levels compared to the rest of the LAC region,
there is a growing perception of low effectiveness of government institutions. Cumbersome
regulations, in many cases resulting from lack
of coordination among institutions, make the
process of starting and running a business—­
particularly a non-FTZ small or medium enterprise—more challenging. Low levels of
transparency and accountability lower the efficiency of public spending. The current political
landscape, where political minorities have the
power to delay votes, further reduces the margin for approving and implementing needed
reforms. The need to improve governance is
apparent in all priority areas, for instance by
increasing accountability in the education sector (e.g., by tracking student achievement to
reward teacher and school performance).
Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities

Employment creation would benefit from
streamlining business regulations as well as the
public procurement and investment processes
to improve infrastructure. A more consolidated budget, fewer tax exemptions, and more
control over spending by autonomous institutions could greatly help to reduce the current
fiscal deficit, and would improve the capacity
to monitor results of public spending. In turn,
results-based management would help to boost
the efficiency of public spending, for example,
enforcing the use of common information systems and modernizing the M&E frameworks
in the social sectors.
An agenda for knowledge. Finally,
a number of knowledge gaps need to be
filled to inform better policy decisions. Although there is a large and productive research and policy analysis community
studying Costa Rica, there are a few issues
where having further research and data collection would provide more information to
help design more concrete policy reforms to

Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities

tackle the issues presented above. For example, the specific factors driving secondary
dropout are still not well understood. In the
labor market, it is not clear whether the contraction of employment in agriculture, manufacturing and construction is of a cyclical
or structural nature, and this has important
implications for low-skilled unemployment.
Like­wise, although there are strong signs that
reservation wages are high, there could be
more studies to quantify this phenomenon
better. To improve the efficiency of the public sector, it is crucial to identify the specific
governance bottlenecks in executing infrastructure projects, as well as their cost implications. Also, the articulation mechanisms to
improve the effectiveness of social programs
need to be based on a thorough institutional
mapping of social programs. Finally, envi­
ron­mental conservation needs to be better
linked with economic activity, and a key
knowledge gap in this regard is how to link
sustainable production and rural landscapes
to conservation.

Appendix A: Team Engagement and
Consultation Process
The Systematic Country Diagnostic
(SCD) core team followed a highly inclusive
process in the development of the final prod­
uct and the elaboration of the diagnostics. In
this appendix, the collaborative steps followed towards the preparation of the draft
document are detailed.

Team collaboration steps within
the World Bank Group

March 2014—Initial Country Team brainstorming: The initial task team organized a
half-day country team meeting to discuss the
guidelines for SCD and to consult on an
initial power-point on key challenges for
adequate growth, inclusive growth, and
sus­tainable growth.
April 21, 2014—Concept Note Review
Meeting: The review meeting took place with
a concept note that laid out the rationale,
objectives, and approach for the task, as well
as the work plan going forward. Some back­
ground papers were commissioned after the
concept note review.
August/September 2014—Formulation of
hypotheses: The SCD preparation process
started with the formulation of a set of 10
general hypotheses around key areas for
Costa Rica’s growth and poverty reduction
patterns based on the review of the literature.
The country team and key specialists in
specific areas provided feedback and comments on their validity as well as additional
information to substantiate, refine, or change
these hypotheses, or to dismiss them.

Appendix A: Team Engagement and Consultation Process

September/October 2014—Brainstorming
sessions: the SCD team held two broad
brainstorming sessions in which the participants discussed: (i) the revised hypotheses
and proposed means of analyzing the know­
ledge gaps; and (ii) a draft of the overall SCD
storyline that translated the hypotheses into a
full structure around growth, inclusiveness,
and sustainability following the SCD
guidelines.
October/November 2014—Bilateral
consultations: Several rounds of bilateral
consultations with sectorial teams were held
to focus on the remaining knowledge gaps
that could be filled prior to the elaboration of
the overall storyline.
December 2014—Quality Enhancement
Review: Chaired by the Latin American and
Caribbean (LAC) Chief Economist, the
Quality Enhancement Review allowed the
SCD team to received feedback on the
storyline from peer reviewers.
February 2015—Prioritization workshop: A facilitated workshop with the broad
Costa Rica Team was held with the objective of soliciting inputs on identified prio­
rity areas for growth, inclusion, and
sustainability. Key constraints and solution
areas were identified for each priority area.
The discussion revolved around how to
simplify the list of priority areas and which
priorities were considered but discarded. At
the end, there was consensus on the cross-​
cutting nature of the proposed priority
areas, and some of them could be combined

143

to provide a better entry point with the
government counterparts.
March 2015—Regional Operation
Committee Decision Meeting: Chaired by
the LAC Vice President, the Decision
Meeting provided further feedback and
guidance to the team.

Engagement with Costa Rica

The SCD preparation was accompanied by a
consultation process in Costa Rica to ensure
that key stakeholders provided inputs into
the deliberations and shared early findings.

144

A preparation mission was conducted during
September 22–26, in which the SCD team
participated in the “Encerrona” event orga­
nized with the counterparts in Costa Rica to
discuss the World Bank engagement. The
SCD team held meetings with counterparts
in Costa Rica from the government, private
sector, academia, and think tanks to get their
views on the poverty and inequality trends,
as well as on the growth pattern of Costa
Rica. Two more consultation missions were
carried out in November 2014 and January
2015.

Appendix A: Team Engagement and Consultation Process

Appendix B: Country Comparators
To benchmark Costa Rica’s performance,
this report uses six comparable groups of
peers: Central American countries, Latin
American peers, upper-middle-income
countries, the average for the World, structural peers, and aspirational peers.
Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) countries are
used as “aspirational peers” given Costa
Rica’s ongoing accession talks to the OECD.
The structural peers were selected using the
“Find your friends” tool.
The group of structural peers includes
countries that provide appropriate benchmarks for answering SCD-relevant questions
such as whether or not certain conditions,
policies, or economic performances in Costa
Rica are adequate. The criteria and filters for
selection were the following: (i) GDP per
capita between US$5,500 and US$15,500, as
Costa Rica is an upper-middle-income
country; (ii) population between 2.5 million
and 20 million people; (iii) CO2 emissions:
Costa Rica is one of the most environmentally sustainable countries in the world, and
only countries with less than 5 CO2 metric

Appendix B: Country Comparators

tons emissions (the world average) per capita
were included in the selection process; (iv)
geography, which often determines comparative advantage and in some cases historical
similarities; landlocked econo­mies and small
island states were excluded, while several
Central American countries were included;
and (v) only non-fragile states were selected.
The use of these criteria resulted in the
following set of countries: Chile, Croatia,
Dominican Republic, Lithuania, Panama,
and Uruguay.

Costa Rica stands out for being among the most politically stable, progressive, prosperous, and environmentally
conscious nations in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. Its development model has brought important economic, social, and environmental dividends, with sustained growth, upward mobility for a large
share of the population, important gains in social indicators, and significant achievements in reforestation
and conservation. However, there are a number of development challenges that need to be addressed to
maintain the country’s successful development path. This Systematic Country Diagnostic takes stock of
the ­poverty, inequality, and growth trends, addressing the following questions:
•
•
•

To what extent has the Costa Rican development model been inclusive?
What has driven growth in Costa Rica in recent years, and what are the bottlenecks that need to be
addressed?
How sustainable is the development model of Costa Rica economically, socially, and environmentally?
