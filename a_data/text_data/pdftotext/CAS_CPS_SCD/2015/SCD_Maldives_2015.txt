THE SYSTEMATIC
COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC
Under its new approach to working with its country partners, the
World Bank Group (WBG) requires the preparation of a Systematic
Country Diagnostic (SCD) to precede the development of
Country Partnership Frameworks which guide programming.
The objective of an SCD is to identify the most critical constraints
and opportunities facing a country in accelerating progress
toward the goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting
shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The SCD is expected
to produce an objective, evidence-based, candid assessment
of the main challenges facing the country, without limitation to
the areas where the WBG is currently engaged.

Data disclaimer
The systematic analysis of opportunities and obstacles for poverty reduction and shared prosperity in
Maldives is limited by shortcomings in official statistics. The lack of consistent and comprehensive data on
micro and macro-economic aspects in Maldives has been identified as a significant obstacle for evidencebased policymaking and policy advice.
Understanding of poverty issues in Maldives is limited by shortcomings in the current poverty measurement
framework and by data quality and comparability constraints. The latest available household survey data to
assess evolution of poverty was conducted in 2009-10; differences in survey instruments and possibly in data
quality limit ability to profile the evolution of poverty.
Due to the open nature of the economy and capacity constraints, macroeconomic, balance of payments and
fiscal data are not always accurate. In particular, it has been suggested that the size of the tourism sector,
even after recent revisions, is still underestimated. On the other hand, the official fiscal expenditure may be
underreported.
The analysis of the real sector trends is constrained by lack of information on industries composition and
out-of-date enterprise surveys. Lack of recent reliable labor force data, especially within the tourism sector,
limits potential for analysis of youth labor market challenges. Similarly, data on role, size, management and
fiscal risk of SOEs is not publicly available.
In undertaking this diagnostic, the team has aimed at complementing official sources of data with information
from stakeholders gathered through surveys, focus groups and consultations. The team acknowledges the
limitations in these approaches and thus data stemming from these exercises is duly identified throughout
the document and used only as means of identification of main issues, rather than as a basis for conclusive
assessment of policies.
Data and knowledge gaps are identified in the relevant sections of the document.

Executive summary
Maldives is an island nation scattered in the Indian Ocean comprising 1,190 small coral islands
of which 190 are inhabited by a local population of 341,000. Maldives’ unique archipelagic coral
island provides the country with an extremely rich and diverse marine ecological system. With
more territorial sea than land, marine resources have played a vital role shaping the contours of
economic development, with nature-based tourism being the key driver of economic growth and
fisheries an important sector of employment for the local population.

GDP per capita
increased from $275
in 1980 to $6,666 in
2013.

But Maldives’
development
model has not
been sufficiently
inclusive and its
immediate fiscal,
environmental and
social sustainability
is at stake.

Tourism-led growth
has followed an
enclave model,
reliant on imported
goods, labor and
finance.

Maldives developed a successful high-end tourism sector, whose sizable rents have been
redistributed to the population to address its development challenges. Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) per capita increased from $275 in 1980 to $6,666 in 2013. This growth rate, which averaged
7 percent between 2002 and 2013, is mainly driven by tourism and non-tradable tourismrelated activities. This impressive track record of economic growth has been supported by capital
accumulation through investment in resorts, and by an increase in the labor force mainly benefiting
foreign workers. Fiscal revenues generated in the tourism sector have been used to address some
of the structural development challenges of Maldives’ economy.
However, Maldives’ development model has not been sufficiently inclusive and its immediate
fiscal, environmental and social sustainability is at stake. Although this economic model based
on tourism-led growth and redistribution of tourism-generated revenues has contributed to
improving well-being of Maldivian population, poverty reduction has been below potential and the
level of inequality – and lack of shared prosperity – remain a major challenge. Moreover, recent
political and socio-economic developments have brought to evidence the inherent vulnerability of
Maldives’ development model and raise immediate concerns about its fiscal, environmental and
social sustainability.
This Systematic Country Diagnostic for Maldives aims at identifying the most critical constraints
and opportunities facing the country as it works towards promoting sustainable growth, reducing
poverty and boosting shared prosperity. In addition to serving as a public good for the government,
civil society, research and academic community, and local and international development partners,
the findings of the SCD will be used as key inputs in the preparation of the WBG strategy, the
Country Partnership Framework, which will outline how the Bank Group’s engagement in Maldives
can best contribute towards achieving the twin goals.

Growth and redistribution
Bound by structural constraints and endowed with extraordinary natural assets Maldives developed
a high-end tourism sector, which has resulted in a very high pace of economic growth over the
past three decades. However, its form of tourism-led growth has followed an enclave model, reliant
on imported goods, labor and finance. While tourism accounts for about a third of the country’s
GDP, it only contributes to 16 percent of the employment in the country. Linkages between
resorts and local economy are similarly limited, with very few products and services supplied by
local enterprises. The employment of Maldivian women in the tourism industry faces particular

8

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

obstacles. Apart from tourism and fisheries, which is a large employment and export revenue
generator, there are few sizable economic activities in the country.
The development of the tourism sector in Maldives has created sizable rents, which, through
taxation and other fiscal means, have been used to address some of the structural development
challenges of Maldives’ economy. In particular, tourism revenues have been used to support job
creation in the public sector, to finance the provision of public services and expand access to
primary health and education facilities beyond the capital area Malé. They also have helped insulate
the local economy from international price fluctuations through a system of universal subsidies
on food. The new constitution introducing democracy in the late 2000s has been accompanied
by an increase in the level of redistribution: (i) the introduction of explicit electricity subsidies;
(ii) the introduction of a universal health insurance scheme; and (iii) an increase in coverage and
generosity of pension system.

Poverty reduction and shared prosperity
Poverty declined
nationwide but not
uniformly across
Maldives’ territory.

Poverty incidence in Maldives is substantially in line with that of an upper middle-income country.
According to the latest available Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) collected in
2009/10, the share of population living with less than $1.25 in 2005 PPP a day was 4.9 percent,
whereas the corresponding share using the $2 a day poverty line was 17.02 percent. These figures
are very similar to the average poverty outcomes of upper middle-income countries (UMIC), two
of the small Pacific islands, and neighboring Sri Lanka. Maldives performs better than the other
countries in South Asia with respect to several socio-economic indicators. Maldives ranks first in
terms of per-capita GDP and second only to Sri Lanka based on the Human Development Index
ranking.
Over the seven years between 2003 and 2010, poverty declined nationwide but not uniformly
across Maldives’ territory. Poverty declined in the Atolls while it remained stable in the capital area
Malé. The poverty rate is the highest in the Central North and Southern atolls, while the capital area
Malé is home to the largest share of poor individuals. Sustained migration from the atolls to the
capital accounts for most of the diverging poverty trends at the subnational level.
Despite progress, the pace of poverty reduction has been below potential when considering the
fast GDP growth of the Maldivian economy between 2003 and 2010 due to growing inequality.
The growth elasticity of poverty reduction (GEPR) in Maldives of about 1.2 percent is relatively low
by international standards. This is evident in comparison to other countries. For example, while
Maldives and Sri Lanka shared the same growth rate (approximately 4.8 percent a year over the
period), poverty reduction in Maldives was one-third less than experienced in Sri Lanka.1 Given the
slow pace of poverty reduction, Maldives will be able to reduce extreme poverty under 1 percent
1

Poverty decreased at about 0.5 percent per year in Maldives as opposed to 1.6 percent in Sri Lanka.

Executive summary (contd.)

by 2040, a much longer period than upper middle-income countries, and other countries in South
Asia. The lack of shared prosperity in Maldives is the main determinant of the limited impact of
growth on poverty reduction. The unequal impact of growth is further reflected by an increase in
the gap between the poorest and richest segments of the population.
Limited jobs opportunities, especially for low-skilled labor might have played an important role in
limiting contribution of growth to poverty reduction. In particular, the lack of growth in fisheries
is an important determinant of the limited contribution of growth to poverty reduction, especially
in the Atolls. As labor income is the main source of household income for the poor, an inclusive
development of the labor market is key for reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

The unequal impact
of growth is further
reflected by an
increase in the gap
between the poorest
and richest segments
of the population.

Maldives is highly
vulnerable to shocks
due to its small size,
lack of economic
diversification
outside tourism,
heavy reliance on
imports, and rigid
budget.

Sustainability
Recent socio-economic and political developments have raised concerns regarding the fiscal,
political, social and environmental sustainability of Maldives’ development model.

Macro and fiscal sustainability
Maldives is highly vulnerable to shocks due to its small size, lack of economic diversification outside
tourism and heavy reliance on imports, while its rigid budget adds more risk. Especially in recent
years, the development model has led to an increasing share of revenue dependent on tourism,
while an increasing share of expenditure has become “rigid.” The lack of macro policy buffers
leaves the country with few instruments to stabilize the economy in the event of a downturn in
tourism.
Unless adjustments are made to revenues and expenditures, the current development model
raises immediate fiscal sustainability concerns. At current trends it is projected to lead to
ever increasing levels of public debt and interest payments, even after the fiscal consolidation
measures budgeted in 2015. The widening fiscal deficit has forced the country to accumulate
more and more domestic debt at ever higher interest rates. Weaknesses in the Public Financial
Management system and management of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) pose further shortterm risks to fiscal sustainability.

Political and institutional risks
As Maldives’ transition to a democratic system is still in progress, powers and relationships among
democratic institutions remain to be settled. Institutional and political uncertainty constrain the
sustainability of Maldives’ development model moving forward.

Social sustainability and vulnerability
Economic opportunities in Maldives are out of sync with growth and shared prosperity. The interplay
of socio-demographic trends and fiscal constraints adds to the social sustainability challenge of
Maldives’ development model. Particularly vulnerable to these challenges are youth and women.
10

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

Limited education
opportunities and
skill endowments
challenge the
capacity of the
youth to realize their
aspirations.

A growing gap between aspirations and opportunities for socio-economic inclusion contributed
to fostering disenfranchisement among Maldivian youth. Limited education opportunities and
skill endowments challenge youth capacity to realize their aspirations though a productive labor
market engagement. High levels of actual and perceived inequality coupled with a progressive
deterioration of the social contract further contribute to widening youth aspiration gap. State and
familial structures combine to create a situation where youth and their families do not have the
incentive to temper youth aspirations, gain skills or search for jobs, feeding into young people’s
limited productive engagement with the economy and society. Social ills such as gang violence and
drug abuse are on the rise, and further contribute to strengthening the exclusion of “youth at risk”
from the social fabric. Moreover, a growing support of more conservative religious practices among
the youth and negative perceptions towards the tourism industry challenge the inclusiveness and
social sustainability of Maldives’ development model.

Environmental vulnerability and sustainability issues
Climate change
could cause annual
economic losses
of more than 12
percent of Maldives’
GDP by 2100.

One of the
most pressing
issues relate to
shortcomings in
the management of
natural resources,
particularly with
regard to sewage
and solid waste
management.

Climate change is major threat in the long run. Climate change could cause annual economic losses
of more than 12 percent of Maldives’ GDP by 2100. Due to rising sea levels, the entire country could
be submerged before the end of the century as 80 percent of land is less than one meter above
sea level. With 42 percent of the population and more than 70 percent of critical infrastructure
within 100 meters of shoreline, this would have dire social and economic consequences, notably
for the poorer and most vulnerable.
There are also short-term threats to environment sustainability. The most pressing issues relate
to shortcomings in the management of natural resources, particularly with regard to sewage and
solid waste management. There is also a growing demand for ground water and rain water as source
of fresh water, which are at high risk due to climate change and are vulnerable to shocks due to
the lack of back-up arrangements. Loss of coral reef due to rising sea temperatures, pollution and
damage represents a threat to the sustainability of the tourism industry and fisheries, and is also
compounding the effects of climate change. Meanwhile, the institutional capacity for managing the
country’s natural resources is relatively weak. The cost of electricity generation through imported
diesel in Maldives is the highest in South Asia, especially in the atolls, while subsidies have led to
overconsumption and underinvestment in renewable sources of energy.

Opportunities for growth
Tourism
Tourism is the most important industry in Maldives, but the linkages with the local economy
are limited. Although Maldives has managed to position itself as a high-end destination, the
sustainability of such premium cannot be taken for granted and an increase in the number of
hotels may lead to lower profitability in the tourism sector. Governance shortcomings in the
current model for allocation of resort leases may be hampering the development of tourism and
preventing the country from maximizing benefits and enhancing inclusive growth, while concerns

11

Executive summary (contd.)

over the investment climate and political risk may undermine the ability of Maldives to attract
reputable investors in the future. The industry has developed as an enclave, with limited positive
spillovers to the local communities.

Better linkages
between the resorts
and the local
enterprises may
help to leverage
tourism growth for
development of other
tradable sectors.

The sustainability
of fisheries is
jeopardized by
inadequate fisheries
management and
overfishing.

12

A more inclusive industry may hold the key to shared prosperity in the country. Better linkages
between the resorts and the local enterprises may help to leverage tourism growth for development
of other tradable sectors. Tourism is a large and rapidly growing source of jobs, but most of them
are not seized by local population due to a host of factors, including: (1) reservation wage that is
too high for unskilled jobs; (2) lack of skills for technical and managerial jobs; (3) social norms;
and (4) lack of adequate transport. A nascent segment of community-based tourism, such as
locally owned guesthouses, may represent a valuable option for diversification and inclusive growth
through integration with local communities. Growth in this segment has some limitations and
risks. There are still unrealized opportunities for linkages between tourism and local providers of
fish and agriculture products, while opportunities for service-provision linkages are more limited,
as many resorts already own and operate their support services and ancillary functions.

Fisheries
The fisheries sector is a critical contributing sector for the country’s national economy and in
almost all of the country’s inhabited islands. The sector traditionally provides employment, exports
and food security. Environmentally friendly fishing methods have enhanced Maldives’ ability to
access premium markets. Marine aquaculture is nascent in Maldives, supported by government
pilot aquaculture projects and a private aquaculture farm. This can be an important source of
economic growth and diversification, poverty alleviation and foreign exchange earnings, but
the future development of aquaculture is hindered by the limited availability of financing and
technology and a lack of clarity on the legal and policy framework.
The sustainability of fisheries is jeopardized by inadequate fisheries management and overfishing.
The industry is experiencing a declining trend, with both catch and employment falling. Employment
of women in the downstream fish processing industry has been reduced to practically nil. Maldives
fisheries sector benefits from high value stocks, but its recent trends highlight vulnerability to
a mix of factors, including overfishing, higher fuel costs, temperature rise leading to change
in schools aggregation and lack of more effective regional eco-systemic management of the
shared skipjack tuna stock. Governance deficiencies (limited number of skipjack tuna processing
licenses) appear to have hampered the development of fisheries and the value they bring to the
economy. Overfishing of reef fish and climate change present risks to the sustainability of the
tuna fisheries as well as tourism. Threats to the health of the coral reefs that are significant to the
fishery sector also come from habitat degradation and loss due to pollution, harbor construction
and reclamation.

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

Agriculture
Food security concerns have revitalized the interest in development of the local agriculture
production. Agriculture is a relatively minor activity in Maldives and has contributed only marginally
to long-term growth. Potential for agriculture is limited due to the scarcity and dispersion of
arable land and high cost of fresh water for irrigation, and the country will remain dependent on
imported food into the future. There are opportunities as well: there may be more potential to cater
to resorts, growth in agriculture will benefit women who form the majority of employment in the
sector, other higher-value fruits and vegetables could be tried tested for cultivation, and low-cost
smallholder greenhouse technologies combined with household based-irrigation/ ‘fertigation’
systems could be explored.

The cost of providing
basic services in a
fragmented country
is high.

Addressing
investment climate
shortcomings will be
essential in order to
enable the creation
of inclusive economic
activities in Maldives.

Constraints
Maldives suffers from the same size and geography challenges as other small island states,
limiting its production base and competitiveness. As a result of these challenges, the cost of
providing basic services in a fragmented country is raised across the board. Public expenditure
in Maldives is structurally high, although Maldives remains an outlier in terms of spending even
if accounting for its size, insularity and openness, and the duality of its economy. With its small
population dispersed over many islands across long distances, the country faces the choice
whether to address the challenge of the high cost of service delivery through consolidation of
population closer to Malé or through improving services and connectivity to populations at their
current locations. There has been a steady migration from smaller to larger islands -- in particular
to the Malé City area -- leading to conditions of overcrowding in Malé, a development successive
governments have tried to address with limited success.
The investment climate in Maldives features important constraints for new entrepreneurs and
for the growth of existing firms. The investment climate in Maldives is much more challenging
than that of similar island economies and other South Asian countries. Challenges extend beyond
what is captured by Doing Business rankings (enabling environment for a firm to start operations,
grow its business and resolve disputes or unwind operations in an orderly, swift and fair manner).
They include lack of access to foreign currency and sudden changes in the legal and regulatory
environment taking place in absence of sufficient consultation with private-sector stakeholders.
Addressing investment climate shortcomings will be essential in order to enable the creation of
inclusive economic activities in Maldives.
The uniqueness of Maldives’ natural resources has enabled the country to attract large amounts
of foreign direct investment (FDI) in spite of shortcomings in the investment climate. However, this
type of FDI, typically into the development of single-island resorts, has had limited positive spillover
to the economy. Moreover, recent events, such as civil disturbances in Male and a high-profile
dispute and costly legal proceedings related to the contract for investment in the international
airport, have the potential to significantly undermine the confidence of foreign investors on

13

Executive summary (contd.)

Maldives. That could reduce its attractiveness as a long-term investment destination in favor of
jurisdictions that can provide a higher degree of certainty to foreign investors.

Sustainable
enhancement of
access to finance in
Maldives will require
the development and
implementation of a
strategy for financial
sector development
that addresses the
shortcomings faced
by the sector.

Maldives is
facing important
governance
challenges that
affect the business
environment and
the soundness and
sustainability of
economic and fiscal
management.

Expanding and
improving human
capital will be of
vital importance to
promote economic
prosperity and
increase jobs for
young people.

Access to finance has been identified as a major constraint for the development of enterprises
in Maldives. Financing to the private sector has been lower than the pace of economic growth,
reflecting a lack of investment opportunities in the local economy. In particular, this has affected
manufacturing, fisheries and agriculture credit, which has fallen since 2007. High collateralization
requirements represent major hurdles to borrowers, especially for small and medium enterprises
and new entrepreneurs. Lack of access to finance has been identified by authorities as a major
obstacle for entrepreneurship in Maldives, but this challenge will not be resolved through
concessional credit initiatives. Instead, sustainable enhancement of access to finance in Maldives
will require the development and implementation of a strategy for financial sector development
that addresses the shortcomings faced by the sector.
Maldives is facing important governance challenges that affect the business environment and the
soundness and sustainability of economic and fiscal management. In the public sector, limited
capacity, a complex institutional framework and inter-institutional conflicts also limit the ability
of the state to support social and economic progress. Institutional capacity remains much lower
than that of an average upper middle -income country. A significant amount of procurement in
the country is carried out by SOEs and the Ministry of Health outside the scope of national rules
and central government controls, leading to doubts if public resources are spent in the most
effective and efficient manner. Public-sector management suffers from inefficiencies. The lack
of settlement in the political and institutional framework impairs the state’s effectiveness, which
has led in particular to weak rule of law. Governance issues also these extend to the resort tourism
sector, where a few business groups control a large share of the market.
Expanding and improving human capital will be of vital importance to promote economic prosperity
and increase jobs for young people. Maldives has performed well in providing access to primary
and lower secondary education. However, the country lags sharply behind in education attainment
at the higher secondary level, while higher education participation is extremely low for a middleincome country. The quality of education at all levels is a major challenge facing Maldives, both
in terms of inputs and outcomes. A major challenge is to equip school and university graduates
with the “soft skills” demanded by employers in the country, the lack of which is linked to high
youth unemployment. The quality of current Technical and Vocational Education and Training
(TVET) services needs to be improved so that it becomes both more attractive for youth and more
relevant for employers. For this, the gap between youth aspirations for employment (white-collar
jobs) and the actual opportunities for employment (e.g., perceived lower-status jobs) needs to be
addressed.
The contribution of social spending to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Maldives
is declining over time. Recently introduced social insurance schemes have created perverse
economic incentives that challenge poverty reduction and shared prosperity moving forward. In

14

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

particular, universal electricity subsidies disproportionately benefit the richer households, while
the generosity of the social pension system has exacerbated intergenerational equity issues and
potentially contributed to increasing distortions on the labor market. (Increasing trends for intergenerational transfers within the household and increasing reservation wages might challenge
direct participation of the youth in the growth process.) Moreover, the defined contribution pension
schemes disadvantage elderly women, given the gender income and wage disparity in Maldives.

Given the importance
of tourism in
Maldives, a more

going forward.

Prioritization
Based on existing evidence and analysis conducted as part of the Systematic Country Diagnostic,
The World Bank identified three priority areas to promote growth, poverty reduction and shared
prosperity in a sustainable way in Maldives. The first is improving opportunities in tourism and
fisheries for the local population. The second is enhancing the enabling environment, including
investment climate, access to finance and skills. The third is improving the efficiency and efficacy of
public resource management and reducing macro fiscal risk. These priority areas were confirmed
in consultations with local stakeholders and used to further validate hypotheses and analysis.
Governance issues appear in many of these priority areas as an important cross-cutting constraint.
Various dimensions of governance constraints can be identified, including lack of transparency in
tourism, overlapping roles of government agencies in fisheries, incomplete legal and regulatory
framework hampering the investment climate, weakness of capacity, in particular in natural
resource management, and deficiencies in the management of SOEs.

Priority area 1: Enhancing opportunities in tourism and
fisheries for the local population
Given the importance of tourism in Maldives, a more inclusive industry represents a major
opportunity for shared prosperity going forward. There are four potential complementary avenues
to improving the inclusiveness of tourism going forward: (1) enhancing the implementation of
the current resort model; (2) enabling sustainable economic diversification within the tourism
sector; (3) enabling local employment; and (4) strengthening linkages between tourism and local
providers of goods and services.
Maldives also has the opportunity to further develop its fisheries sector, and to capitalize on the
potential benefits to enhance economic growth and sustainable development at a national level.
As sustainable and inclusive growth of the fisheries sector will likely not be based on increasing the
volume of catch, a transition to a wealth-based fisheries management system may hold promise
for the future. There are a range of targeted options for exploiting the opportunities presented to
Maldives fisheries sector at present, but effective strategies and plans will need to be developed in
order to identify not only economic potential, but also environmental impact.

Executive summary (contd.)

Priority area 2. Enabling opportunities for creation of new
sources of growth

Improving
the enabling
environment
will enhance
the potential for
entrepreneurship,
creation of new
firms and growth of
existing ones.

The sustainability
of Maldives’
development model
is dependent on how
well the authorities
manage the
country’s wealthgenerating natural
resources and its
financial resources
to redistribute this
wealth, and how
resilient the country
is to external and
domestic shocks.

Economic diversification and competitiveness in Maldives are hampered by significant structural and spatial
constraints, but improving the enabling environment will enhance the potential for entrepreneurship, creation
of new firms and growth of existing ones. Maldives faces similar structural challenges of other small island
states that restrict the extent to which the country can attain competitiveness across the board. However,
there are visible untapped opportunities where potential (in terms of existing demand and proved production
capacity) exists, both within value chains of existing industries, as well as potential new economic activities.
Enabling the local population to seize these opportunities will require addressing a host of factors that
represent the overall enabling environment in the country. These factors include enhancing the investment
climate, access to finance and human capital.

Priority area 3: Improving the efficiency and efficacy of public
resource management and reducing macro fiscal risk
The sustainability of Maldives’ development model is dependent on how well the authorities manage the
country’s wealth-generating natural resources and its financial resources to redistribute this wealth, and how
resilient the country is to external and domestic shocks. Maldives’ natural resources are its marine life and its
coral reefs, but there are weaknesses in the exploitation of its natural resources and in its preparedness for
natural hazards. It appears that a lack of planning capacity at the local and national government level is the
main constraint to dealing with the challenge of sustainability.
The main mechanisms to redistribute the wealth generated by tourism are public sector employment,
social services, subsidies and transfers. The sustainability of the positive outcomes achieved through this
redistribution system crucially depends on improving its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The public sector
employment freeze contributes to managing the wage bills and improving fiscal sustainability, and fiscal
savings can be used to mitigate the negative impact on employment. While it is important to continue to
provide wide access to health and education services, more careful planning based on the demographic
distribution of the population could improve efficiency of spending and free resources to improve quality.
Targeting reform of electricity and food subsidies could improve efficiency of spending while freeing
resources to protect the poor. Operational savings in the universal health insurance system Aasandha could
cut its cost significantly, while preserving the principle of universal health insurance. Finally, there could be
fiscal savings from improving SOE management and procurement.
Better management of its resources may also make Maldives more resilient to external shocks. Maldives
will remain exposed to external shocks from tourism under its current development model. While it cannot
eliminate its vulnerability to shocks Maldives has opportunities to reduce its vulnerability and increase its
resilience within limits by: (1) reducing exposure to shocks by diversifying its sources of tourism and reducing
its reliance on fossil fuel; (2) improving international conditions to reduce the domestic transmission of
shocks by reforming public expenditure and reducing the risk of the public debt portfolio; and (3) increasing
its risk management through improving institutional quality, including public financing management and
planning capacity, and increasing policy space.

Maldives has positioned itself
as a premium destination
for tourism and benefits
from high quality fish stocks.
These industries offer major
opportunities, but growth
can be more inclusive and
sustainable.

section I : country context
Maldives is an island nation in the Indian Ocean comprising 1,190 small coral islands of which 199
are inhabited by a local population of 341,000.2 Maldives’ unique archipelagic coral island provides the
country with an extremely rich and diverse marine ecological system. With more territorial sea than
land, marine resources have played a vital role shaping the contours of economic development, with
nature-based tourism being the key driver of economic growth and fisheries an important sector of
employment for the local population. The population geography in Maldives is strongly polarized. The
capital Malé, strategically located at the center of the archipelago and served by the first and busiest
international airport, is the single most populous island of Maldives, with density as high as 53,700
people per square kilometer3 against an average of approximately 1,900 people per square kilometer
in the atolls (Figure 1).4

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

Maldives shares
many of the Small
Island Developing
States development
challenges. However,
in the case of
Maldives, these
challenges are
compounded by its
high geographic
dispersion with 1,190
coral islands.

Over the past 30 years, Maldives has successfully built on its extraordinary natural assets to promote
growth and socio-economic development. Maldives shares many of the Small Island Developing
States development challenges, such as: a small domestic market; a narrow and fragile resource
base; a shortage of skilled manpower; difficult inter-island transport and communication; high
cost of social and economic infrastructure provision; and heavy dependence on external trade
and vulnerability to external shocks and natural disasters. However, in the case of Maldives, these
challenges are compounded by its high geographic dispersion with 1,190 coral islands (199 of which
are inhabited) grouped in 26 atolls, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometers. Nevertheless,
the development of a profitable high-end tourism sector has fueled sustained growth rates and
supported public investments in health and education. In the early 1980s, Maldives was one of the
world’s 20 poorest countries. Thirty years later, its inhabitants enjoy the same levels of GDP per
capita and human development outcomes as a middle-income country.
However, Maldives’ model of economic development has not been inclusive and its future
sustainability is at stake. Although this economic model based on tourism-led growth and
redistribution of tourism-generated revenues has contributed to improving well-being of Maldivian
population, poverty reduction has been below potential and the level of inequality – and lack of
shared prosperity – remain a major challenge. Moreover, recent political and socio-economic
developments have brought to evidence the inherent vulnerability of Maldives’ development model
and raise immediate concerns about its fiscal, environmental and social sustainability.
This Systematic Country Diagnostic for Maldives aims to help identify the most critical constraints
and opportunities facing the country as it works towards promoting sustainable growth, reducing
poverty and boosting shared prosperity. In addition to serving as a public good for the government,
civil society, research and academic community, and local and international development partners,
the findings of the SCD will be used as key inputs in the preparation of the WBG strategy, the
Country Partnership Framework, which will outline how the Bank Group’s engagement in Maldives
can best contribute towards achieving the twin goals.

Key Messages
∫

Maldives development model is based on tourism-led growth and redistribution of
tourism generated revenue

∫

Maldives development model has led to a very high pace of growth

∫

Poverty reduction in Maldives is below potential due to lack of shared prosperity

∫

Public expenditure has increased over past five years

∫

Maldives’ fiscal deficit has been widening leading to high public debt, while its foreign
exchange reserves are very low

Maldives’ model of socio-economic development relies on tourism-led growth and redistribution
of tourism-generated revenue (Figure 3). The redistribution of revenue through public service
delivery is complicated by the geographical dispersion of the archipelago that prevents achieving
economies of scale, and ultimately leads to question whether this model is sustainable. The
performance of this development model will be assessed on its ability to: (1) generate growth;
(2) include as much of the population as possible in the growth process though productive forms
of employment: and (3) efficiently redistribute resources towards the neediest segment of the
population to facilitate poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

Growth
Bound by structural constraints and endowed with extraordinary natural assets Maldives
developed a high-end tourism sector, which has resulted in a very high pace of economic growth
over the past three decades. GDP per capita increased from $275 in 1980 to $6,666 in 2013
(Figure 4). This growth rate, which averaged 7 percent between 2002 and 2013 is mainly driven
by tourism and non-tradable tourism-related activities (including construction, transport and
communications) (Figure 5). This impressive track record of economic growth has been supported
by capital accumulation through investment in resorts, and by an increase in the labor force mainly
benefiting foreign workers.

GDP and GDP per Capita

GDP (USD million)

Economic growth in Maldives has been reliant on the development of tourism, with very limited
contribution of other economic activities. Tourism accounts directly for around 30 percent of
nominal GDP,5 and has accounted for about 28 percent of real GDP growth between 2002 and
2013. Including tourism-related sectors,6 these numbers increase to 64 percent of nominal GDP
and 65 percent of real growth. There are few other primary industries contributing to economic
growth, and they are small in relative size. Manufacturing, fisheries and agriculture combined
accounted for 9.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and private sector-led growth outside of the tourism
sector has been limited.

Real GDP growth

Transport, communication, financial services and business services benefit directly from tourism activity and tend to be highly

But Maldives’ form of tourism-led growth has followed an enclave model, reliant on imported
goods, labor and finance. Accordingly, while tourism accounts for about a third of the country’s
GDP, it only contributes to an estimated 16 percent of the employment in the country. Even when
including sectors that benefit indirectly from tourism employment increases to only 22 percent of
the total (Figure 35). Linkages between resorts and local economy are similarly limited, with very
few products and services supplied by local enterprises. Manufacturing firms are small in size and
lack the quality and reliability demanded by high-end resorts.

The participation of women in tourism jobs has been low. Even when Maldivians are employed, only
about 30 percent are women, according to data from the 2009/10 HIES. Research suggests that
social dynamics influence employment decisions such that families are reluctant to allow young
women to take jobs in the tourism sector because they would have to travel from home to other
islands and because the tourism sector is associated with “immoral and unethical” practices.7
A lack of child-care or residential facilities for employed women in the tourism sector further
exacerbates familial unwillingness to allow young women to work away from home. Women’s
limited control of transportation means to travel to and from resorts adds another hurdle.8

Geographical spread of

The tourism industry has contributed to an already large geographical spread of activity. Starting
in the atolls around the main international airport in Malé (Central North), the tourism sector is
still largely concentrated around Malé, with 84 percent of resorts within 130 kilometers from Malé
airport. However, the industry has been slowly taking advantage of advances in transportation
opening up atolls to the north and south. In fact, the first resort outside this range was opened in
2005 and there has been a steady increase since. (Figure 6).

Other economic activities also show large geographic dispersion. While public service jobs are
also concentrated on Malé, with limited spread to the atolls, agricultural production takes place
mainly in the Central North and Central South regions. For households in the outer atolls, public
and private transfers are important source of household income (Figure 7).

Apart from tourism, there are few sizeable economic activities in the country. Fisheries make
up the second most prominent industry in the country after tourism, and are the largest goods
export earner. Maldives benefits from access to high quality fisheries stock, but a large share
of its value is lost through export of fish as commodities to intermediary markets. As opposed
to tourism, fisheries accounts for a very small contribution to GDP (1.7 percent) but a larger
share of employment (10.5 percent).9 Agriculture provides 2.3 percent of GDP and 4.5 percent of
employment, but it does not export. However, while the economy doubled in size between 2002
and 2013, fisheries shrunk by 21 percent, and agriculture grew by only 24 percent over that period
(Figure 8).

Role of the state and redistribution
The development of the tourism sector in Maldives has created significant sources of revenues
to the country. Since the nationalization of all land in the country in 1979 and the revocation of
all permits to operate guesthouses on inhabited islands in 1984, the development of the tourism
sector in Maldives has been largely dominated by a limited number of local businessmen.10 Barriers
to entry and capacity controls contributed to limiting competition and diversification of investors,
but also have increased rents for the state as it has managed to extract increasing fees from
concessions and lease agreements11 (Figure 9).
Revenues generated in the tourism sectors have been used to address some of the structural
development challenges of Maldives’ SIDS economy. In particular, tourism revenues have been
used to support job creation in the public sector,12 to finance the provision of public services and
expand access to primary health and education facilities beyond the capital area Malé; to provide
social insurance against financial risks of old age and out-of-pocket health expenditures, as
well as to insulate the local economy from international price fluctuations through a system of
universal subsidies on food and energy (Figure 10).

Mihdha (2008).
The tourism sector is taxed directly through the Tourism Tax (or bed-night tax), the Airport Departure Tax, the Goods and Services
Tax on Tourism (TGST), while tourism also has a significant impact on import duty and Business Profit Tax revenue. Resort lease
rent provides a large share of non-tax revenue.
Jobs in the public sector account for 17.3 percent of total employment, while jobs in education, health and social services account
for 20.5 percent of employment (as of 2010).

The large number of SOEs further contributes to strengthening the role of the state in Maldives’
economy. SOEs play a dominant role in many sectors, including trade, fisheries, finance, construction,
transport, health and utilities. Although their contribution in total fiscal revenue has declined from 19
percent in 2003 to 4 percent in 2013, thanks to the shift towards new forms of taxation, combined
revenue of the main three SOEs was still equivalent to 37 percent of GDP in 2013. There are currently
around 84 SOEs13 , about half of which require active monitoring, whereas 28 have been identified by
the government for liquidation.14
The new constitution introducing democracy in the late 2000s has been accompanied by an increase
in the level of redistribution. In particular, the increase in public spending has been mostly driven by:

The introduction of explicit electricity subsidies. Due to high costs of domestic electricity production
and distribution, the country has a long history of subsidized energy prices.15 The current system of
explicit electricity subsidies was introduced in 2009 in parallel with the reform of electricity tariffs.
While the electricity tariff reform was meant to curb utility providers’ losses by allowing a costrecovering pricing, the contemporaneous introduction of subsidies had the effect of transferring the
cost of the electricity tariff reform and of any future increase in fuel prices onto the government’s
budget. Over the last four years, spending on electricity subsidies increased nine times, escalating
from 0.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.7 percent in 2014 (Figure 11).

Because of complex ownership structures, the number of firms in which the state has a combined direct and indirect stake of at least
5 percent increases to 92. The state has a control of at least 50 percent in 61 firms, out of which it has 100 percent control of 46.
Draft Aide-Memoire, Maldives Governance of State Owned Enterprises (SOE) mission, World Bank, June 22 - 29, 2014
Due to Maldives’ reliance on imported diesel for electricity generation and inefficiencies in generators’ capacity, the cost of electricity production in Maldives is up to five times as high as in neighboring countries. In particular, electricity production in Maldives is
2.5, 3.3 and 5 times more expensive than in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, respectively.

The introduction of a universal health insurance scheme. The country’s geography and
dispersed population, along with its high dependence on imports of medical consumables
and expatriate manpower, have meant that health services come at substantially higher costs
when compared with other countries in the region. Maldives spent 9.2 percent of its GDP on
health in 2011, about half of which came from the government treasury and the rest from
household sources. Responding to a growing demand for financial assistance to cope with
out-of-pocket health expenditure, the government introduced a universal health insurance
system, Aasandha, in January 2012. However, the piecemeal nature of the reform, continuing
capacity issues within the government and inadequate preparation and planning for these
reforms have contributed to continuing efficiency, impact and cost challenges. In its first
year of introduction, the scheme received claims for MVR 943.6 million (corresponding to 2.4
percent of GDP), well in excess of the amounts approved in the government budget.16

∫

An increase in coverage and generosity of pension system. The 2009 Pension Act extended
old-age protection beyond workers employed in the civil sector and mandated the introduction
of a two-pillar pension system comprising of Maldives Retirement Pension Scheme ( a new
contributory pension scheme based on a defined contribution model) and the Old Age Basic
Pension (OABP) (a universal non-contributory pension system for individuals 65 and older).
While the extension of coverage of the pension system is aimed at closing protection gaps
between the public and private sector, implementation challenges during the reform and
the particular generosity of the OABP scheme have contributed to increasing government
spending.

Maldives performs better than the other countries in South Asia with respect to different socioeconomic indicators and gender equality. Compared to other countries in South Asia, Maldives
ranks first in terms of per-capita GDP and it is second only to Sri Lanka based on the Human
Development Index ranking (Figure 13, left panel). In 2010, life expectancy at birth was 76.8, three
years higher than both the average for UMICs and Sri Lanka, the second best of the South Asia

region. Further, Maldives performance is better than the average UMC also with respect to infant
mortality rate, although it is second to Sri Lanka in the South Asia region (Figure 13, right panel).
Maldives fares significantly better than many countries when it comes to gender equality, ranking
49th on the Gender Inequality Index in the 2014 Global Human Development Report of UNDP, in
comparison with its Human Development Index ranking of 103th. The island nation has the least
disparities between men and women, when compared with other medium human development
countries as well as its South Asian neighbors. The country has attained gender parity in primary
and secondary enrollment, and the number of Maldivian women attaining university degrees is at
par with that of men.

Over the seven years between 2003 and 2010, Maldives achieved a substantial decline in poverty.
The poverty headcount based on the national poverty line declined by seven percentage points,
from 23 percent in 2003 to approximately 16 percent in 2010. Depth and severity of poverty
declined from 6 to 4 percent and from 2.3 to 1.6 percent, respectively. Similar positive trends are
observed considering the $2 PPP international poverty line. On the other hand, no statistically
significant poverty decline is registered when considering the $1.25 PPP international poverty line
(Figure 14).

Poverty declined in the atolls while remaining stable in the capital area Malé. The decline in poverty
observed at national level is the result of opposite poverty trends at regional level. In particular,
while poverty remained substantially stable at around 18 percent in the capital area Malé, it
declined markedly in the atolls – going from 25 percent in 2003 to 14 percent in 2010. Similar
patterns are observed using the international poverty lines (see Figure 15).

The poverty rate is the highest in the Central North and Southern atolls, while the capital area Malé
is home to the largest share of poor individuals. The Central North region of the archipelagos is
the poorest in both years, with poverty rates of 35 percent in 2003 and 25 percent in 2010. This is
followed by the Southern region, with 28 percent poor individuals in 2003 and 21 percent in 2010.
The Central region reduced its poverty rate by more than 80 percent in seven years (see Figure 16).

Sustained migration from the atolls to the capital accounts for most of the diverging poverty trends
at the subnational level. The seven years between 2003 and 2010 are characterized by substantial
population movement from the atolls towards the capital area Malé. The share of individuals living in
Malé increased from 20 percent to 42 percent of the overall population. With only the exception of the
Central North region, where the population remained stable at around 24 percent, all other regions saw
a reduction in their population shares, particularly the Central and the Northern regions (Figure 17).
The pace of poverty reduction is below potential when considering the fast GDP growth of the Maldivian
economy between 2003 and 2010. The GEPR in Maldives is relatively low by international standards. In
particular, considering the $2 PPP poverty line, the GEPR in Maldives is about 1.2 percent, meaning that
for each percent increase in Maldives’ per capita GDP, poverty fell by a mere 1.2 percent. The limited
contribution of growth to poverty reduction in Maldives is evident when compared to other countries.
For example, while Maldives and Sri Lanka shared the same growth rate (approximately 4.8 percent
a year over the period), poverty reduction in Maldives was one-third less than experienced in Sri
Lanka.17 Even Nepal and Pakistan managed to reduce poverty faster than Maldives, although in these
two countries GDP growth was, respectively, 2 and 2.5 percentage points lower (Figure 18, left panel).
Maldives’ limited performance in terms of poverty reduction is even more striking when considering its
relatively high potential as suggested by the initial level of per capita income. With a per capita GDP of
$3,360 in 2003, Maldives started with the highest poverty reduction potential of the South Asia region.
Despite the large income lever that could have helped lift individuals out of poverty, Maldives’ elasticity
of poverty to GDP growth was significantly lower than countries starting from similar levels of per capita
GDP, and closer to that of countries with lower levels of per capita GDP such as India or Bangladesh
(Figure 18, right panel).
Given the slow pace of poverty reduction, Maldives will be able to reduce extreme poverty under 1 percent
by 2040, a much longer period than similar upper middle-income countries, and other countries in
South Asia. If poverty keeps decreasing at the same rate as in the period 2003-2010, Maldives will
reduce extreme poverty below 1 percent in 30 years, as opposed to only eight years needed to Sri Lanka,
and more than double the time of the average middle-income country (14 years). Even Pakistan and
Nepal, which start with much higher poverty rates, will be two years faster than Maldives in defeating
extreme poverty (see Figure 19).

17

Poverty decreased at about 0.5 percent per year in Maldives as opposed to 1.6 percent in Sri Lanka.

Growth is not equally

while people in the
upper part of the

The lack of shared prosperity in Maldives is the main determinant of the limited impact of growth
on poverty reduction. Shared prosperity remains a major challenge for Maldives. As shown in
Figure 20, growth is not equally shared by all sections of the distribution: the bottom 40 percent
is growing less than average, while people in the upper part of the distribution are growing much
faster. This un-equalizing impact of growth slowed down poverty reduction. Had all the segments
of the population benefited equally from growth (i.e. had growth been distribution neutral), poverty
would have declined by as much as 11 percentage points (Figure 21).
The unequal impact of growth is further reflected by an increase in the gap between the poorest
and richest segments of the population. The increase in inequality induced by growth deepened
the polarization of welfare distribution in Maldives. While inequality as measured by the Gini index
declined slightly from 39.9 percent in 2003 to 38.6 in 2010, the polarization as measured by
quintile ratios increased.18 In particular, if in 2003 the poorest individual in the top 10 percent

32

The Gini index is more sensitive to capturing changes around the mean of a distribution, and it is therefore poorly suited to capturing polarization and changes around the tails.

Limited job opportunities, especially for low-skilled labor, might have played an important role
in limiting the contribution of growth to poverty reduction. Low education levels, inactivity and
unemployment are strongly associated with a higher risk of poverty. According to HIES 2009/10
data, the lower the educational attainment of the household head, the higher is the likelihood that
the household is poor. About 88 percent of the poor (and 84 percent of those in the bottom 40
percent) live in households whose head has only completed primary education (see Figure 22).
Looking at labor market outcomes, Maldivian households whose head is unemployed or inactive
are on average 1.5 and 1.2 times more likely to be poor than average.

Employment at the lower spectrum of the skill distribution is associated with higher poverty rates.
In particular, poverty rates are higher when the head of household is employed in construction (26
percent), manufacturing (18 percent) and fisheries/agriculture (17 percent). Taken together, these
three sectors account for more than 50 percent of the poor individuals with working household
heads, and the fisheries sector alone accounts for about 26 percent of the total (Figure 23).
Fisheries development is particularly important in the atolls, where 30 percent of the household
heads work in the fishery sector (as opposed to only 1 percent in Malé). In the atolls, the fisheries
sector alone accounts for 41 percent of poor individuals with a working household head.

Percent of distribution

As labor income is the main source of household income for the poor, an inclusive development
of the labor market is key for reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Labor income
accounts for more than 70 percent of the total household income of the poor, and it is the main
source of income for 70 percent of poor individuals. In Malé, where two-thirds of employed
household heads work in public administration, education and health and services, labor income
comes primarily from wages. In the atolls, where 45 percent of employed household heads work
in fisheries and manufacturing, labor income is mainly self-employment income (see Figure 23).

Recent macroeconomic and fiscal trends
After hitting 1.3 percent in 2012, economic growth has been steadily recovering and is estimated
to amount to 5 percent in 2014.19 Most other service sectors are estimated to have grown as well
in 2014, while the industrial sector expanded by 13.2 percent in 2014, driven by construction,
following a contraction of 1.5 percent the previous year. However, the agriculture and fisheries
sector is estimated to have contracted by 2.1 percent in 2014 after posting growth of 5 percent in
2013. (Figure 24). See also Box 2 for a discussion on macro data.
Average stay continued its secular decline as the composition of tourism changes further. The
average stay of tourists declined to 6.1 days, down from a recorded average of 7.1 days between
2009 and 2013, reflecting a structural shift in the composition of tourism. Between 2010 and
2014 the share of European tourists fell by 20 percentage points from 63.8 to 43.9 percent due to
weaker economic conditions in Europe. The simultaneous increase in the number of Asian tourists
and demand from Middle East mitigated the weakening European demand. During the 2010-2014
period the Asian share of tourists expanded by 15.2 percent while the share of Middle Eastern
tourists grew by 1.6 percent (Figure 25).

New taxes in 2011 and 2012, mainly on the tourism sector, have increased fiscal revenue
structurally; however, the fiscal deficit widened to an estimated 11.6 percent of GDP in 2014.
These taxes include the new Tourism Goods and Services Tax (TGST, which was increased from 8
to 12 percent in November 2014) and an increase in the Airport Departure Tax. All these taxes are
borne by tourists, who, according to the authorities, have an inelastic demand curve.20 In addition,
a Business Profits Tax21 and a General GST have been introduced. The net impact has been to
increase revenue from 21.9 percent of GDP in 2010 to 32.4 percent of GDP in 2014 (Figure 28).

Annual average inflation moderated even further in 2014, falling to 2.4 percent, down from 4
percent in 2013 driven by low food prices and international crude prices. The fall is particularly
steep considering the 10.9 percent inflation rate recorded in 2012. As measured by the overall
consumer price index, inflation in Malé has been unstable since 2009 with large fluctuations.
Following a spike in inflation in 2011, when the currency was floated and sharply devalued, inflation
started showing signs of moderation and fell to a low of 2.4 percent in 2014 (Figure 26). During
the second half of 2014, inflation fell even further, driven largely by a drop in food prices (Figure
27). Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages grew at a pace of 1 percent in 2014, as opposed
to 7.5 percent in 2013.

However, persistent and widening fiscal deficits have led to a high level of public debt, which stood
at 74.6 percent of GDP at end of 2014. This represented a net increase of 36.8 percent from 2003.
This increase was driven by persistent deficits, while fast GDP growth relative to the average real
interest rate on debt provided some downward pressure on the level of debt.
Recognizing the unsustainable outlook of its fiscal accounts, the Government has proposed fiscal
consolidation measures in its 2015 budget. On the revenue side this includes a “green tax” on
tourism (which effectively replaces the Tourism Tax, which was abolished in late 2014, although
at a lower rate), increases in import duties, a one-off revenue boost from Special Economic Zones
(SEZ) acquisition fees and the extension of resort leases. On the expenditure side, the budget
proposes to better target subsidies and freeze public employment. Although these measures, if
properly implemented, will help reduce the deficit, they are unlikely to be sufficient to decrease
the upward path of public debt, and further fiscal consolidation through expenditure and revenue
measures will be needed in the short and medium term.
Driven by high fiscal expenditure, the current account has been persistently in deficit, reaching
an estimated 8.4 percent of GDP in 2014. The goods trade deficit is roughly offset by tourism
revenue, but net income outflows (such as dividends and interest payments on external debt)
and remittance outflows lead to an overall structural current account deficit. The deficit has been
financed through foreign direct investment, while net capital outflows by private banks reflect the
limited investment opportunities in the non-tourism sector.
Indeed, apart from buying Treasury bills, the banking sector shows limited appetite to invest in the
domestic economy. While the government has started to borrow increasingly from banks in recent
years, a significant proportion of remaining bank assets are parked at the central bank, earning a
very low overnight night rate,22 or are sent abroad.23

The Overnight Deposit Facility was introduced in 2010, and the rate has been 1.5 percent since September 2014 (as of May 2015).
This may be a combination of repayments of earlier loans incurred in the mid-2000s and investments.

Meanwhile, credit to the private sector growth has mostly stagnated since 2008. In addition, credit
to the private sector is concentrated in tourism, which is a legacy of a large increase in resorts
leased out in the mid-2000s when local branches of banks borrowed from foreign head offices
to lend to the domestic tourism sector. Since the global financial crisis, credit growth has been
close to zero, with a write-off of non-performing loans in 2012.24 The focus has now moved to
construction, electricity and real estate and other loans and advances (Figure 30).

At the end of 2014, gross international reserves increased, but net usable reserves remained low
at only $120 million, covering less than a month of imports. As a result of the large improvement
in net capital inflows, gross official reserves have increased from $368 million at the end of 2013
to $614 million at the end of 2014, covering 3.7 months of imports of goods and services. However,
the stable exchange rate and the parallel market premium do not signal any shortages. In practice,
the amount of reserves in the economy may be much larger, and the tourism industry appears to
supply sufficient quantities of foreign exchange at a stable premium over the official exchange
rate. The exchange rate remained at MVR 15.4 per USD, while the premium declined, as major
SOEs abstained from the secondary market.

Box 2. A real crisis or a macro data crisis?
It has often said that Maldives is perennially at the verge of a crisis. When looking at the
macro data the question is indeed why the country is not in a crisis.
According to the IMF’s 2013 Debt Sustainability Analysis update, Maldives was at high risk
of debt distress. In particular, the country had a persistent current account deficit of around
20 percent of GDP; public domestic and external debt was 73 percent of GDP at end-2011,
while private external debt was estimated at 38 percent of GDP. By February 2013, official
reserves amounted to $304 million, equivalent to just 1.6 months of imports, and freely
usable reserves amounted to only $99 million. Despite these challenges, stores were stocked
with imported items and the exchange rate premium was modest.
How can this puzzle be explained?
First, the tourism industry seems to hold sufficient amounts of reserves at home and abroad
to be able to supply sufficient quantities to the parallel market to keep the premium stable.
Second, given the extreme openness of the economy, the measurement of financial flows
through the current and capital account are inaccurate. Similarly, poor financial management
and recording practices contribute to underreporting on the expenditure side.
The national accounts were revised recently according to international practice resulting in
an increase of nominal GDP over previous estimates (e.g., by 13 percent in 2013, Figure 2.1).a
At the same time, significant revisions have been made to the balance of payments data
using new data sources, better methods and new data in line with IMF technical assistance
recommendations. This resulted in large changes to the services balance (mostly tourism),
goods balance (imports) and financial accounts, leading to a substantially narrower current
account deficit (Figure 2.2), higher estimates of FDI inflows and reduced private-sector
borrowing. Moreover, surveys and anecdotal evidence suggest that the tourism exports could
still be underestimated.
As a result of these adjustments, the current account deficit in 2013 has been revised from
20.5 percent of GDP to 6.5 percent of GDP. The level of public debt at end-2011 has been
revised down to 59 percent of GDP, while the estimated level of private external debt has been
revised down to 13 percent of GDP.

On the other hand, the actual fiscal deficit is estimated much higher than the reported
deficit. The fiscal deficit (reported by the Ministry of Finance) cannot be reconciled with net
external and domestic borrowing by the government (reported by the Maldives Monetary
Authority). While current expenditure in 2013 was reported as 32.6 percent of GDP by the
authorities, the IMF estimates it to be 36.5 percent of GDP, mainly a result of the authorities
underreporting interest payments, and incomplete and underreporting of subsidies and
social welfare schemes, operations and maintenance payments.
Although the country looks less vulnerable now, it is still considered on an unsustainable
fiscal path, as the most recent joint World Bank-IMF DSA of 2015 points out.

Key Messages
Maldives development model is inherently vulnerable to shocks and increasingly not
sustainable. In particular:

Maldives is highly
vulnerable to shocks
due to its small size,
lack of economic
diversification and
heavy reliance on
imports.

∫

Maldives is highly vulnerable to external macro shocks

∫

Maldives democratic transition is still in progress and political instability high

∫

Maldives social contract is at risk due to lack of inclusiveness, especially of youth

∫

Environmental sustainability is at risk due to climate change, lack of preparedness for
natural disasters, waste management and lack of access to potable water

∫

Electricity generation cost is the highest in South Asia

Recent socio-economic and political developments have raised concerns regarding the
sustainability of Maldives’ development model. Despite a long period of sustained economic
growth, the vulnerability of Maldives’ model of development is increasing over time, especially with
respect to its fiscal, social, political and environmental sustainability.

Macroeconomic vulnerability and sustainability
Maldives is highly vulnerable to shocks due to its small size, lack of economic diversification and
heavy reliance on imports. Furthermore, increasing macroeconomic imbalances and escalating
public debt represent a growing source of external vulnerability. While the Maldivian economy has
shown resilience in the past, the country may currently lack appropriate buffers to cope with a
shock that would affect the tourism sector, terms of trade or interest rates.

Box 3. How “special” is Maldives?
Before the tsunami hit in 2004, expenditure levels were in line with other island states, such
as Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Barbados and Dominica, which are all countries with
higher tourist receipts, large fiscal deficits, large current account deficits and a soft-peg
exchange rate. Moreover, expenditure was in the 20th to 80th percentile of emerging and
developing countries. After the tsunami and the introduction of democracy, expenditure has
moved to the top 20th percentile and has stayed there (Figure 3.1).
Maldives is also an outlier in many ways compared to the rest of the world. Its exports
and imports are the 97th percentile of the world, its current account in the 8th percentile
(although the recent revision makes the current account deficit less exceptional), and
expenditure in the 77th percentile (Figure 3.2).

As a small island
state with a high
level of imports, the
country is vulnerable
to changes in
commodity prices.

As a small island state with a high level of imports, the country is vulnerable to food and fuel
commodity prices through the balance of payments. Moreover, as it subsidizes flour, rice and
sugar, and diesel-based electricity generation, the fiscal accounts are equally vulnerable to price
shocks. Indeed, 2011, the year of the exchange rate devaluation, saw a one-off spike in subsidies
of 0.7 percent of GDP.
Tourism has created additional channels of external vulnerability to shocks, which has created
significant volatility for the economy as a whole. The trends over the past decade have highlighted
the fact that tourism can be affected by a host of factors beyond the control of the country. These
include environmental events (the tsunami affecting Maldives directly), global economic trends
(the 2001 recession and the recent global financial crisis affecting wealth of European travelers),
and even security concerns abroad (September 11 terror attacks limiting air travel). These external
shocks have been passed on to the economy as a whole, given the high dependence of Maldives
on tourism.

Rigid expenditure

Note: Rigid expenditure defined as salaries, wages and allowances, social welfare contributions, interest payments and
subsidies and transfers. Tourism-related revenue defined as tourism tax, GST on tourism, Airport Service Charge, royalties,
land and resort rent, (part of) import duty revenue and Business Profit Tax.

Especially in recent years, the development model has led to an increasing share of revenue
dependent on tourism, while an increasing share of expenditure has become “rigid”. That is, an
increasing share of expenditure consists of items that are not easily adjusted in the event of a
downturn in revenue: subsidies and transfers, social welfare contributions, salaries and wages and
interest payments (Figure 31).

Unless adjustments
are made to revenue
and expenditure, the
current development
model will lead to
ever increasing levels
of public debt.

The lack of macro policy buffers leaves the country with few instruments to stabilize the economy
in the event of a downturn in tourism. With high debt and an already high fiscal deficit, it will be
difficult to increase expenditure or reduce taxes in the case of a downturn. Moreover, for a small
island state with most consumption goods imported and a high pass-through of exchange rate
fluctuations into inflation,25 exchange rate stability is of utmost importance. The country’s official
foreign exchange reserves have frequently reached levels below three month’s import coverage.26
This limits the country’s ability to respond to pressure on the exchange rate, which has led to
devaluations in 2001 and 2011 and to balance of payment support in 2005 after the tsunami and
in 2009 after the global financial crisis.
Maldives’ already high level of public debt and fiscal path leads to immediate fiscal sustainability
concerns. Unless adjustments are made to revenue and expenditure, the current development
model will lead to ever increasing levels of public debt, even after the fiscal consolidation measures
budgeted in 2015. Overall public debt (including domestic debt) is estimated at 74.6 percent of GDP
at the end of 2014, well above the benchmark of 56 percent of GDP established under the LIC-Debt
Sustainability Framework.27 It is projected to continue to grow throughout the projection horizon,
driven by a persistent primary fiscal deficit. An increasing share of the budget will be devoted to
paying interest on debt. Moreover, growth shocks and fiscal slippages would lead to even higher
25

88 percent of a change in the nominal effective exchange rate is passed to consumer prices within one year (Masha and Park,
2012).
It should be noted though that a lot of foreign exchange remains outside the central bank, and private agents are often able to find
foreign exchange when needed.
A joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been carried out.

levels of debt. Meanwhile, the persistent current account deficit has led to an increasing level of
external debt, and the country is at “moderate risk of debt distress.” Although the level of debt is
below the policy-dependent thresholds, a shock to tourism exports could make it difficult for the
country to service its external debt (Figure 32 and 33).

Note: Unlike the face value, the present value takes into account debt concessionality.

Moreover, the widening fiscal deficit has led to rising interest rates. The widening fiscal deficit has
forced the country to accumulate more and more domestic debt. As a result, the government has
resorted to central bank debt financing (until May 2014) and domestic arrears28 as additional
financing sources. As market interest rates started to increase strongly by mid-2013, the
authorities put a cap on interest rates (called a “tap” system), which has temporarily stabilized
interest cost on domestic debt.
Accumulated domestic arrears add an additional fiscal burden. The stock of accumulated domestic
arrears was estimated at 6.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2012. About 82 percent was owed to
SOEs, in particular to the government-owned importer of fuel, medicine and basic food, and to the
Aasandha Company (health insurance). The emergence of arrears is the result of both unrealistic
budget envelopes and a lack of expenditure controls.29

This points to weaknesses in public financial management as a source of fiscal risk. The budget
as a policy document suffers from a lack of credibility and limited policy orientation. Expenditure
composition variations are significant at more than 15 percent of the original budget. Furthermore,
there is no credible medium-term macro-fiscal framework and it has a weak and inefficient system
of budget review. Existing cash constraints limit the predictability and control of the budget.
Moreover, although consolidated financial statements have been produced since 2011, data
quality and consistency are a concern. The government does not meet the basic practices of fiscal
risk disclosure and analysis on contingent liabilities and actual liabilities. There is no complete
picture of contingent liabilities that may arise from loan guarantees that have been issued as the
government does not report on the main risks to its fiscal forecasts.30
SOEs may pose further risks to fiscal sustainability as most are loss-making and depend on
government support, with only nine companies having contributed dividends to the budget in
the last four years. Shortcomings in the operations and oversight of SOEs contribute to macrofiscal risks, due to inadequate regulation and supervision. Most SOEs operate at a loss, and
represent a drain to the budget and a source of risk associated to costly fuel imports, foreign
exchange transactions, and payment arrears. Capital transfers to SOEs and subsidy transfers have
contributed substantially to the growth in expenditures in recent years (Figure 34). An independent
centralized ownership entity (the Privatization and Corporatization Board) was established under
a comprehensive legal framework in 2013, but final decisions on the appropriate institutional
arrangements are still under consideration.

Political and institutional risks
Maldives democratic transition started recently. The country adopted a new constitution in 2008,
ushering in multi-party elections as well as a set of new state institutions at central and local levels,
often with mandated high degrees of independence. The new constitution enacted a mechanism
for separation of powers by creating independent branches of the Legislature, Executive and
Judiciary for the first time in the history of the country.
Powers of and relationships among democratic institutions are still being defined. For instance,
until recently parliamentarians were able to simply add expenditures to the budget on their own
initiative without concern for expenditure limits and all independent commissions created their own
human resource regimes. More importantly, Maldives is a split polity where political contestation is
not always handled through institutional channels. There have been frequent incidences of political
unrest over the past 10 years and election processes have been criticized by observers as lacking
credibility in many key aspects. Institutional incoherence and political instability currently hamper
the ability of the government to provide goods and services and to carry out its redistribution
function, which is central to social and economic inclusion in Maldives. It poses a longer-term risk
to improving government operations and, more generally, public trust in the state.
Institutional and political instability constrain the sustainability of Maldives’ development
model moving forward. There is widespread consensus that political stability was critical to the
development of the tourism industry in Maldives. The current polarization of the political party
system, resulting political unrest and the limits of checks and balances between powers, all
contribute to aggravating political and institutional risks as well as macro and social sustainability
issues.

Economic opportunities in Maldives are out of sync with growth and shared prosperity. Public
administration is the primary sector of employment in Maldives, particularly for the educated
local workforce. Alone, it accounts for 17 percent of total employment and one-fourth of the
employment for workers with secondary or higher levels of education. The tourism industry, while
driving the growth process and being the main contributor to GDP, accounts for only 16 percent
of employment and relies disproportionally on expatriate workforce for both high- and low-skilled
jobs. The fisheries sector, which is a crucial sector for poverty reduction and shared prosperity,
accounts for 11 percent of total employment and one-fourth of the workforce with less than
secondary education (Figure 35).

The interplay of socio-demographic trends and fiscal constraints adds to the social sustainability
challenge of Maldives’ development model. The progress in health indicators, notably the reduction
in mortality rates over the past decades, has contributed to Maldives demographic transition. With
a reduction in the total fertility rate to population replacement rates, the population growth has
stabilized, creating the opportunity for a demographic dividend (Figures 36 and 37). The increase
in the working age population, with a shift toward a relatively more educated young labor force,
puts enormous pressure on the absorption capacity of Maldives labor market. That is especially
the case in view of the hiring freeze of the public sector – which constitutes the main employer for
high-skilled jobs – and the increasing competition coming from a relatively cheaper (low-skilled
jobs) and better educated (high-skilled jobs) expatriate workforce.

∫

The increasing supply of educated youth in a context characterized by limited labor demand
by the public sector and a skills mismatch in the private sector has contributed to high youth
unemployment. In 2010, according to HIES data, the unemployment rate for individuals in
the 15 to 24 age group was 25 percent, more than double the unemployment rate of the total
workforce (11.8 percent). The lack of economic opportunities for the youth is contributing
to other social ills, such as drug abuse and gang-related violence, especially among male
youth.

∫

The public sector has traditionally been the biggest employer of women in Maldives, with
34 percent of female employment in the health and education sector and 15 percent
employment in public administration. Limited working hours and availability of jobs on
inhabited islands have made public employment particularly appealing for women and
contributed to sustaining relatively high female labor force participation (58 percent).
Fiscal constraints to job creation in the public sector have contributed to increasing female
unemployment vis-à-vis males.

A growing gap between aspirations and opportunities for socio-economic inclusion has contributed
to fostering disenfranchisement among Maldivian youth. After 30 years of sustained economic
growth and social development, the current generation of youth is the first faced with the prospect
of not being able to achieve the same level of wellbeing as their parents. Increasing competition
from foreign labor for high- and low-end jobs and limited opportunities for employment in the public
sector contribute to worsening social mobility prospects for the new generation. Disenfranchisement
and frustration are growing, especially in the capital area Malé were many youth migrated with the
hope of building a future.
Limited education opportunities and skills challenge youth capacity to realize their aspirations though
a productive labor market engagement. Employment status is crucial to shape life satisfaction,

wellbeing and self-esteem, especially among young males (WDR 2013).31 Facing competition from
foreign labor and lacking sufficient skills to face the challenge, Maldivian youth are increasingly
confronted with bleak labor market32 opportunities and a failure to meet their aspirations in terms of
social mobility. The current economic model has proved unable to provide the youth with the skills and
knowledge necessary to compete on a globalized labor market and low productivity public sector jobs
are becoming increasingly unappealing and scarce due to government budget constraints.

The current

Social ills such as
gang violence and
drug abuse are
on the rise, and
further contribute to
strengthening the
exclusion of “youth at
risk” from the social
fabric.

High levels of actual and perceived inequality coupled with a progressive deterioration of the social
contract further contribute to widening youth aspiration gap. As discussed in Chapter 2, high and
increasing levels of inequality between the poorest and the richest segments of the population, as
well as unequal opportunities between Malé and the atolls, all contribute to the emergence of social
cleavages that work against cohesion and social development33. Moreover, governance constraints,
such as the lack of transparency and accountability, together with the inability of politics to address the
most urgent social and economic concerns, add to youth frustration and challenge future prospects of
inclusive economic development in Maldives. These ongoing social dynamics contribute to widening the
gap between the adult generation – currently in power and benefiting from the security associated with
the redistribution of the rents from past economic development -- and a young generation struggling
to find social space and identity under uncertain socio-economic circumstances.
Social ills such as gang violence and drug abuse are on the rise, and further contribute to strengthening
the exclusion of “youth at risk” from the social fabric. Anecdotal evidence suggests that gang participation
and violence is on the rise among young men. In Malé alone there are 20-30 active gangs, each with 50400 members, a majority of whom have suffered from violence or perpetrated violence. Moreover, the
intensity of gang violence is reportedly rising.34 This increase in gang violence is likely an effect of the
social, political and economic exclusion of the country’s youth because of their disengagement from
the labor market and other spheres of public life. Gangs offer a form of inclusion by offering a sense
of identity and group belonging, and provide financial rewards: a significant proportion of young men
in gangs are deemed to be engaged in drug dealing.35 Illicit drug use among gang members is also
increasingly problematic, and is further fueling gang-related and broader social violence. Though drug
users are overwhelmingly male, there is evidence to suggest that it is an increasing problem for women
who are increasingly subject to sexual and gender-based violence.36

As discussed in the WDR (2013), job opportunities contribute to determine individuals’ status within a society and how people view
themselves in relation to others.
This lack of skills includes technical skills, as well as the so-called ‘soft skills’ to secure employment, and when employed, to stay
in a job, such as positive attitudes toward work and learning, respectful professional relationships, time management and good
attendance, self-esteem and confidence, and sound professional decision-making. Consequently, young Maldivians may not get
the jobs they desire because they are perceived to be less responsible, and have a poorer work ethic than the older generation or
the large numbers of migrant workers. Employers interviewed for a recent gender assessment of the Maldives opined that they are
unwilling to hire young Maldivians because those they had hired in the past regularly came to work late, take unscheduled leave, are
unresponsive to supervisor input, and sometimes vanish altogether without any explanation. World Bank, (2014c).
Empirical evidence strongly points out that income inequality leads to greater social and political instability. See Alesina and Rodrik,
1994, Alesina et al 1996. Briguglio et al. (2006) include social development among the essential components of economic resilience
in SIDS. According to the authors (ibid: 275), “Social development […] indicates the extent to which social relations in a society
are properly developed, enabling an effective functioning of the economic apparatus without the hindrance of civil unrest. Social
development can also indicate the extent to which effective social dialogue takes place in an economy, which would in turn enable
collaborative approaches towards the undertaking of corrective measures in the face of adverse shocks.”
Asia Foundation(2012)
ibid.; p.15.
According to data from the most recent DHS, over one-quarter (28.4%) of Maldivian women have experienced physical and/or
sexual violence at some point in their lives by either partners or non-partners. Though this proportion is lower than other South
Asian countries, it is higher than in other middle-income Asian countries like Malaysia (14.5%), Indonesia (3.7%) or the Philippines

3. Vulnerability and sustainability issues (contd.)

These dynamics might further limit opportunities for socio-economic inclusion, particularly of
Maldivian women. According to the HIES (2010), while the major reason given by both women and
men for being unemployed was their inability to find suitable employment, 22 percent of women
cited household chores as a reason, and another 3 percent were deterred by objection from family
members. Thus, lack of supporting environment in the family was a major factor discouraging a
significant number of women from seeking employment. In particular, marriage and pregnancy
at a young age, geographical isolation, and social norms restricting women’s mobility are factors
that limit women’s contribution to national development.

Natural resources represent the country’s main asset but there are growing concerns in terms of
sustainability. Climate change could cause annual economic losses of more than 12 percent of
Maldives’ GDP by 2100.37 Due to rising sea levels, the entire country could be submerged before the
end of the century as 80 percent of land is less than 1 meter above sea level. With 42 percent of the
population and more than 70 percent of critical infrastructure within 100 meters of shoreline, this
would have dire social and economic consequences, notably for the poorer and most vulnerable.
Despite past efforts, the country is not prepared to withstand a rise in sea levels, as most lifeline
infrastructure (such as power houses, hospitals and harbors), population centers (such as
schools) and dwellings are not adequately designed. Indeed, “the most serious underlying driver
of increasing vulnerability to climate change in Maldives appears to be the absence of systematic
adaptation planning and practice. Climatic risks and long-term resilience are not adequately
integrated into island land use planning or into coastal development and protection policies and
practice, and past autonomous risk reduction efforts have sometimes had mal-adaptive effects”.38
In order to partially address this, the government prepared a Strategic National Action Plan in
June 2011 to integrate Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation, but its actual
implementation appears to be limited.39

The most pressing

management.

However the most pressing issues relate to shortcomings in the management of natural resources,
particularly with regard to sewage and solid waste management. An estimated 248,000 tons of
solid waste was generated in 2007, most coming from urban areas (Figure 38), and this figure is
expected to increase to 660,000 tons by 2020.40 Despite the scale of the challenge, most of the
134 Island Waste Management Centers, covering 66 percent of the islands, are not fully functional,
as no program for transport of waste from these centers to a regional or central waste-processing
center has been established.41 Regulation seems to be poorly enforced. Resorts, in particular, have
been accused of dumping waste in the sea and not using incinerators as mandated by law (Figure
39), although this assertion has not been documented. Adequate management of solid waste
is hindered by the high cost of service delivery in the country, associated with the low volume of
waste on each island and the high cost of transportation. Land scarcity also limits the options for
establishing and managing adequate landfills. The issue of sewage and solid waste is particularly
challenging, as it has a direct impact on the country’s most valuable natural resources – coral
reefs and fisheries. Uncontrolled waste disposal and floating debris at tourist resorts are the most
visible threats to the country’s reputation as a pristine high-end tourist destination. They also
affect the quality of ground water, with a direct impact on island communities.

3. Vulnerability and sustainability issues (contd.)

Most of the Maldivian population depends on the ground water and rain water as source of fresh
water, which are at high risk due to climate change. As Maldives consists of low-lying islands,
the rise in sea-levels would force salt water intrusion into fresh water lens. Minimum projected
sea level rise of 1mm per year shows that the groundwater safe yield will decrease at least by
3 percent between 2012 and 2030. In addition, in most inhabited islands the groundwater is
contaminated due to untreated sewage disposal into the ground. It is estimated that per capita
water availability will decline by 34 percent from the 2009 level of 103 cubic meters per year
to 76.6 cubic meters per year by 2035. The shifting in the rainfall pattern from drier and more
inter-annually variable rainfall regime over the next 20 years and increase in temperature of
0.5°C to 3.5°C expected by 2100 will increase water demand leading to high competition over
scarce resources, making water security for potable and irrigation purposes continue to be a
serious problem.42 Confronted by diminishing resources, more than 100 islands have requested

emergency fresh water shipments since 2005, and the challenge is likely to increase over time
due to continued population pressure.43 The institutional framework for managing fresh water
supply needs strengthening, as the government does not have any single and unifying body
overseeing the water and sanitation sector and therefore no quality checks are performed.
The country is also vulnerable to shocks to drinking water supply due to the lack of back-up
arrangements. This vulnerability was shown clearly by the water crisis in December 2014, when
a fire in a water treatment plant in Malé led to acute shortages of drinking water and required
emergency supplies from neighboring countries.
The loss of coral reef represents a threat to the sustainability of the tourism industry and
fisheries, and is also compounding the effects of climate change. Coral reefs are a major tourist
attraction in Maldives but are affected by the rise in sea temperature and pollution However, the
damage to coral reefs caused by harbor dredging and reclamation are much more significant
now as a result of the current development model. Other pressures include damage caused by
divers, illegal collection of corals and unsustainable exploitation of high-value reef resources.
As coral reefs also play an important role in protecting shores against rising sea levels, their
destruction may also aggravate the impact of climate change. Furthermore, the loss of coral
reef is resulting in the loss of valuable bait fish which are used for tuna fisheries, a major source
of food and income in outer atolls.

Institutional capacity for managing the country’s natural resources is relatively weak. Because of
limited resources, environmental management is largely done on a limited and voluntary basis
on the islands. Governmental environmental agencies face important issues in retaining scarce

Maldives has a significant potential for lowering the cost of electricity generation through wider
use of renewable energy. At the present time power is supplied by diesel generators through
isolated, island-specific grids, spread over 900 square kilometers. The country relies almost
entirely on imported fossil fuel to supply the generators, costing about 15 percent of GDP in 2013.
Furthermore, due to the high costs of domestic electricity production and distribution, the country
has a long history of subsidized energy prices that have contributed to over-consumption and
limited incentives opportunities to invest in alternative and environmentally sustainable renewable
energy sources. Currently, the cumulative installed photovoltaic-based generation capacity is
less than 2 MW, spread across several islands and programs. While the installed PV capacity is
still limited, it has demonstrated its viability as a source of cheaper and cleaner energy. Going
forward, wider adoption of renewable energy will require, among other things innovative financing
approaches such as PPPs and a review of the incentives scheme, including the current subsidies
on diesel-based electricity generation.

Maldives has experienced a high pace of growth, but the main challenge will be to enhance
its inclusiveness going forward. As discussed in previous sections, the Maldivian economy is
dominated by tourism, while tradable sectors and physical exports are largely limited to fisheries.
Tourism has leveraged the country’s endowments to underpin a very rapid growth, but the largely
high-end tourism industry has developed in an enclave way, with limited linkages with the local
communities. Fisheries are a significant source of employment, particularly for the poor, but the
industry has stalled and much of the value is lost through low-added-value exports. The small size
of the economy, together with other structural environment factors, has limited the development
of other economic activities. Accordingly, the rapid overall economic growth of the country has
not been accompanied by a commensurate growth in opportunities and jobs for the Maldivian
population – especially for the youth, and for women whether youth or adult.

Tourism in Maldives has grown steadily since 1970s and Maldives has managed to position itself as
a high-end destination (Figure 40). Tourism in Maldives has developed as a supply-driven industry
whose development was initially led by the private sector - as opposed to through government
policies or support programs. Notably, while the supply for touristic facilities is constantly
increasing, the country so far has been largely able to maintain both high occupancy rates (Figure
41) as well as a high premium (deemed as high as 40 percent45 over other touristic destinations).
Such premium is deemed to be based on the unique natural resources of the country, as well as on
the exclusivity of facilities – which, in turn, is underpinned by the geographic dispersion of islands
and the enclave conditions of resorts.

However, the sustainability of such premium cannot be taken for granted. The tourism industry
has been susceptible to external shocks and changes in global trends. Most recently, the global
financial crisis prompted a structural shift in the composition of arrivals, from Europe to Asia.
Between 2008 and 2013, the share of European tourists fell by 26 percentage points mainly due
to weaker economic conditions in Europe. Conversely, the share of Chinese tourists expanded by
23 percentage points (Figure 42). This shift in demand was pursued by the industry, which made
important marketing efforts in China and Middle East to compensate for the declining demand
from Europe. While this shift helped maintain the volume of arrivals and occupancy, the overall
profitability of the industry appears to be declining. The average length of stay fell from eight
nights in 2008 to 6.1 in 2014 and is expected to continue declining as Chinese travelers favor
shorter stays than European ones (Figure 43) and have a lower demand for ancillary activities
such as diving and fishing, which generate additional revenue for the industry.

And increase in supply may enhance downward pressures on the profitability of tourism. The
volume of development of new tourism capacity has been growing and is expected to continue
growing. At the present time, there are 89 new resorts under development with a planned capacity
of 14,153 additional beds.46 If completed, these new resorts would increase the supply of beds by
52 percent over the established capacity at the end of 2014. This evolution could translate into an
increase in revenues as has been the case in the past, but it could also reach an inflection point
where increased capacity will start driving down prices and premium. Lack of planning has led to
sub-optimal growth and development proposition as potential resort developments are brought to
market with little analysis or coordination with other sectors (such as transport47 or skills training).
While investor interest has remained strong, these challenges often threaten the financial viability
of new projects and their ability to attract financing.
Governance shortcomings in the current model for allocation of resort leases may be hampering
the development of tourism and preventing the country from maximizing benefits and enhancing
inclusive growth in three main ways. First, although the resort sector is open to competition on
paper, in practice the sector is dominated by a few large groups. In theory the legal framework

for tourism allows for open and competitive bidding on resorts, although islands in which the
government makes an investment are exempted from the bidding process.48 In practice it
appears that there are significant barriers to entry,49 which may have prevented the country
from maximizing the benefits from its natural resources. As a result, as of the end of 2013, the
four largest tourism groups (including two of the pioneers) control 31 percent of resorts and 38
percent of the resort beds. Their influence has remained strong over the decades. For example,
of the resorts established in the 1990s and after 2010, the four groups account for 52 and 44
percent of the beds, respectively (Figure 44).50

Second, the current methods for allocating leases has translated into sub-optimal investment
levels, with a large number of leased islands remaining undeveloped or suffering severe delays
in construction. At present there are 106 licenses granted for new resorts, but there have been
significant delays in construction of the planned resorts. Indeed, one-third of the licensed resorts
have not come into operation more than five years after the license was granted, and 22 licensed
resorts have experienced delays of around 10 years. Altogether, the licensed but unfinished resorts
would account for 21,000 additional beds51 that are planned but have not materialized as a source
of income for the country (which would increase by 78 percent the capacity in the country; create
31,000 additional direct jobs;52 and provide significant revenue flows to the country through taxes
and duties). The significant delays in construction of resorts after a license is granted have been
blamed on a host of factors, including lack of financing. While these factors may indeed become
hurdles once a license has been granted, the delays in construction appear to evidence significant
shortcomings in the process followed to grant the licenses in the first place. Stringent and clear
criteria for licensing of resorts would have enabled the country to ensure that licenses are granted
to investors than can demonstrate the qualifications, experience and financial ability to develop the
resorts shortly after licenses are granted. Clear enforcement processes would enable authorities
to cancel non-performing leases and grant them to better qualified investors.

Third, entities set up to promote the development of tourism may be helping to undermine the
governance of the sector. The Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Cooperation (MMPRC) is
as a state-owned enterprise formed in 2009 to promote and market the tourism industry. The
Maldives Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) was set up in 2006 as an entity with 47
percent government ownership and 53 percent private shareholding. Both MMRPC and MTDC can
acquire leases for resort islands without being subjected to the standard bidding process and, in
some cases, at below market rates. In turn, these leases can be developed or subleased to private
parties. While the Ministry of Tourism has aimed to strengthen governance of leases through
implementation of standard operation procedures, these subleases are not subject to the standard
operating procedures of the Ministry of Tourism and both MTDC and MMRPC lack procedures to
ensure transparency in subleases and prevent corruption. Further, the composition of the boards
of directors of MTDC and MMPRC has raised concerns on lack of transparency on appointments
and potential conflicts of interest. The later stems from the fact that board members include
heads of private tourism companies that can benefit from subleases.53 Notably, MTDC holds five
leases that were granted nine years ago and represent an expected capacity of 1,280 beds that
have not come into operation. This, together with governance concerns on their operations, calls
into question the extent to which these two organizations are contributing to development of the
tourism industry in a way that maximizes the benefits to the country.

53

At least one case has been identified of a private company linked to a board member which has been granted a sublease from
MMPRC.

country.

Investment climate and political risk concerns may also undermine the ability of Maldives to attract
reputable investors in the future. Recent political unrest (which prompted travel advisories from
various countries) together with international media reports highlighting the risk of radicalization
have created concerns among tourism private stakeholders of a potential slowdown in demand
from Western tourists as well as potential long-term deterioration of Maldives brand. Future
additional investment may also be affected by investors’ perception of instability in regulatory
environment. This includes: a lack of formal consultation between government agencies, private
sector and civil society on key policy decisions; a regulatory environment in a state of constant
flux that leaves businesses financially exposed and unable to plan; and a potentially insufficient
implementation period for the industry to adapt to new compliance measures.54 Recent negative
experience in FDI disputes likely works to undermine investors’ confidence in Maldives (see also
section on investment climate below).
And the industry has developed as an enclave, with limited positive spillovers to the local
communities. The country’s unique island geography presents many natural as well as sociocultural barriers to integration. It is spatially dispersed with small surface areas, and has limited
transport connections and a small population. As a result, the tourism industry has grown up
in relative economic isolation with heavy reliance on foreign capital, foreign labor and limited
economic linkages. There are also significant structural and social barriers to Maldivian women’s
employment in the tourism sector that contribute to its lack of inclusiveness.
Given the importance of tourism in Maldives, a more inclusive industry may hold the key to
improving shared prosperity in the country. The industry is dominated by luxury enclave resorts,
which have grown with heavy reliance on foreign capital and foreign labor and limited linkages
to the rest of the economy. While there are a number of ancillary industries that have grown
alongside tourism (notably through demands on the transport, construction and communication
sectors), the linkages between tourism and the local economy remain modest. The participation
of women in either the tourism sector per se or in ancillary industries is low. Tourism generated
38 percent of government tax revenue (2013)55 and 83 percent of the country’s foreign exchange
earnings from exports of goods and services, but substantial leakages undermine the economic
and social benefits of the industry. A large proportion of the revenue generated through tourism
is lost through import of products, import of labor and financial outflows related to dividends and
external debt servicing (as external debt largely fuels resorts development) and offshore booking
of revenues originated by resorts. These areas are further discussed below.
Better linkages between the resorts and the local enterprises may help to leverage on tourism
growth for development of other tradable sectors. According to anecdotal evidence, close to 100
percent of the goods required by resorts are imported. It is suggested that local enterprises lack
the ability to provide goods with the quality and reliability needed to cater to the expectations of
the high-end resorts. Government policies supporting import substitution have not translated into
a visible growth in the real sector, which remains hampered by, among other things, the small
size of the economy (with limited economies of scale), high dispersion of the population, and

high transport costs. Given the structural limitations of the country, the potential for backward
linkages between tourism and local enterprises is likely modest and probably limited to a handful

Tourism is a large and rapidly growing source of jobs, but most of them are not seized by local
population due to a host of factors. While tourism creates a large number of jobs, the Maldivian
population does not take advantage of them. Across the board, only 15 percent of employed
Maldivian men and 4 percent of employed Maldivian women work in the tourism sector, while the
number of foreign nationals employed in the sector has increased constantly over time (Figures
45and 46). A government-imposed quota (requiring 55 percent of employees in tourism to be
Maldivian nationals) is customarily unmet56 and, in general, appears to have failed to sustainably
enhance the participation of Maldivian nationals in tourism. Tourism in Maldives has created
more than 28,000 direct jobs57 and government targets for new resorts58 imply an added annual
requirement for 3,300 new staff. The relative importance of this figure is evident when compared
to the unemployment figures in the country. The total number of the unemployed in Maldives is
estimated around 11,000, of which around 8,000 are young people. The lack of participation in
tourism jobs is particularly dire among women, who account for less than 3 percent of the labor
in the industry.

The obstacles to enhance broader participation of the Maldivian nationals in tourism appear to
be manifold. Information collected from stakeholders, civil society and youth through interviews
and consultations during the preparation of this diagnostic identified a number of factors that
appear to be at play in restricting broader participation of the local population on tourism. These
include: (1) reservation wage that is too high for unskilled jobs; (2) lack of skills for technical and
managerial jobs (see section on skills below); (3) social norms (see section on youth below); and
(4) lack of adequate transport (resorts that are close to inhabited islands and have good transport
links have a much higher proportion of Maldivian workers). However, data does not currently exist
to validate these perceptions in a conclusive manner.59

According to the 2014 census (published by the National Bureau of statistics) the foreign nationals account for 58.4 percent of all
tourism employees, but anecdotal evidence suggests that this figure may me significantly higher.
According to the 2014 census (published by the National Bureau of statistics) there were 11,425 Maldivian employees (10,991
male and 435 female) at resorts, and 16,342 foreign employees (14,339 male and 2,003 female). However, according to the Ministry
of Tourism, by early 2015, a total of 23,917 resort beds creates an approximate total employment demand (at a ratio of 1:1.5) of
31,000 staff.
The Government’s plans for development of tourism consider ten resorts (average bed capacity is 220) each year. Source: Ministry
of Tourism.
This has been confirmed in interviews with Maldivians for the youth and gender studies.

A nascent segment of community-based tourism may represent a valuable option for diversification
and inclusive growth (Figures 47 and 48). Most importantly, this segment appears to create
opportunities for tourism that is well integrated with local communities. Guesthouse development
is the fastest growing segment. New legislation in 2009 allowed islanders to develop their homes
into guesthouses. This new product has grown rapidly, totaling approximately 238 facilities with
3,565 rooms, with likelihood of doubling in the next three years. Every atoll (bar one) is now hosting
some kind of guesthouse or hotel on inhabited islands, with the majority concentrated in the urban
centers of Hulhumalé and Malé (79 establishments). Attracting a different market, this product
does not represent competition for resorts other than at an infrastructure level – considering the
existing limitations of the international airport.

Notably, the potential for integration of this market segment with local communities appears high.
First, the proportion of Maldivian nationals working in this market segment (estimated by the
industry at 75 percent of total workforce, see box) is significantly higher than in resorts (estimated
below 45 percent). Second, there is evidence of a nascent ‘ecosystem’ of local suppliers of goods
and services around guesthouses. Third, closer interaction between tourists and islanders in
an every-day setting has been relatively positive in this situation, and may be a case study in
‘exposure’ and breaking of socio-cultural stigmas towards the sector in general.
Growth in this segment has some limitations and risks. It is likely to be highly concentrated around
transport hubs (airports) since elasticity of demand will be lower in this segment. Most importantly,
the rapid and unplanned growth of this market segment has already translated into visible negative
impact on the environment compounding the existing challenges in inhabited islands. Waste
management, land-use planning, population displacement and environmental management are
some of the issues at the forefront of inhabited islands already. Simply supporting the increase of
supply will put pressure on island resources to the detriment of all.

There are still unrealized opportunities for linkages between tourism and local providers of goods
and services. The tourism industry is a large and rapidly growing source of demand for goods.
In 2014, food items alone (grains, fruit, meat, beverages) were imported at a total cost of$407
million60 and demand is expected to increase substantially as the sector grows over time (see
figure). The tourism sector’s demand for inputs represents a major opportunity for local producers
(Figure 49). But at the present time most of the goods are imported, given limitations in local
supply. Resorts report61 a high willingness to purchase inputs locally and are prepared to pay a
premium for fresh produce. Maldives is deemed to have potential for competitiveness in producing
a number of agriculture and fishery goods,62 which are already being produced successfully, but
in quantities still lower than demand.63 Local cooperatives and agricultural-focused islands64

Ten crops have been selected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for high potential in achieving self-sufficiency. Applying
other filters such as consistent and growing demand from the tourism industry, and a low barrier to entry for Maldivian producers
yields a list that includes; bananas, papaya, coconuts, lettuce, cucumber, flowers and tuna amongst others.
For example, according to Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture’s estimates (no country-wide statistics exist) local producers are
deemed to produce around 400,000 kgs of bananas, a 52 percent of the estimated demand from resorts (755,000 kgs per year).
There are eight agricultural islands and various production cooperatives.

Fisheries
The fisheries sector is a critical contributing sector for the country’s national economy and forms
the most important primary economic activity in almost all of the country’s inhabited islands.
Before the development of tourism, fisheries was the most important industry and source of
growth for Maldives and, to a large extent, fisheries remains an important reference in Maldives
culture. Although the relative importance of the fisheries sector has declined since the late 1970s
(due mainly to the rapid growth of tourism), its role in the Maldivian economy remains significant.
Fisheries remain a large, source of employment (see below), the largest source of physical exports,
one of the few local industries supplying the touristic resorts, and a major source of food supply
for the local market. In 2011, it accounted directly for 1.4 percent of GDP and currently generates
$110 million in export revenue.

The fisheries industry
is experiencing
a declining trend
evidenced by
lower catch, lower
employment and
lower contribution to
GDP.

Maldives has benefited in terms of both food security and trade. Along with the tourism sector,
the productive fisheries sector has been a leader in the country’s growth and development. The
fisheries sector has remained vital in terms of trade, employment and subsistence especially on
islands not dominated by the tourism industry. With a fishing-fleet of about 800 national vessels66,
close to 10,000 individual fishers and their families depend on fishing. In addition, fish is a staple
food across the archipelago and it remains the main source of protein for the population, covering
around 88 percent of the total animal protein intake (FAO, 2011). Maldives is among the highest fish
consuming countries in the world67 ; 49 percent of the fish catch is consumed locally.68 Fish and
fish products account for almost 98 percent of Maldives physical exports.
However, the industry is experiencing a declining trend (Figures 50 and 51 and Table 1). A
marked decrease (-28 percent) in catch volumes between 2006 and 2013 has undermined the
contribution of fisheries to GDP (-54 percent) and translated into rapidly decreasing employment
in direct fishing activities (32 percent reduction between 2006 and 2013 69). While these figures
do not include jobs in processing and ancillary industries, the reduction in direct employment is
particularly concerning given the fact that fisheries represent the single most important source
of jobs in many islands, especially those that are not close to the capital or touristic resorts. The
reduction in women’s employment in fisheries is particularly dire; the increased mechanization
of the fisheries has largely taken over the fish processing activities that were the foundation of
female employment in this sector. Thus women’s work in fisheries has been phased out such that
female employment is practically nil in this sector.69 In spite of these negative trends, the value of
fisheries exports has increased over the same period, reflecting higher prices for fisheries exports
and thus signaling the unrealized potential economic contribution that a more thriving fisheries
industry could make to the country.

The Maldivian government imposed the termination of foreign long-line licensing in May 2010.
It is assessed that 341 kcal of fish are consumed per capita per day (FAO, 2011).
Worldwide, about a billion people rely on fish as their main source of animal proteins. About 20% of the world’s population derives at
least one-fifth of its animal protein intake from fish, and some small island states depend almost exclusively on fish. WHO (2015)

Maldives fisheries sector benefits from high value stocks, but its recent trends highlight vulnerability
to external factors. While the country benefits from access to vast fishing resources spread over
90,000 sq. km of territorial waters, the bulk of fisheries catch (82 percent) is dominated by two
types of tuna (skipjack and yellow fin), which are exported. The Maldivian tuna is considered as
a premium product benefiting both from high quality fish stocks as well as sustainable fishing
methods (pole and line). In 2013, 95 percent of the 130,000 tons of fish catch was tuna70 . The
current fish catch consists of skipjack tuna (57 percent), yellowfin tuna (35 percent), and other

kinds of tuna (3 percent). Catches of skipjack tuna have decreased drastically over the
past years due to a mix of factors including overfishing, higher fuel costs, temperature rise
leading to change in schools aggregation and lack of more effective regional, eco-systemic
management of the shared skipjack stock. Conversely, catches of yellowfin tuna are increasing
thanks to its increasing price in foreign markets and the rapid growth of the hand-line fishery
(Figures 52 and 53). Reef fish, which account for 16 percent of catch, are mainly used for
internal consumption and supply to resorts.
Governance deficiencies appear to have hampered the development of fisheries and their
value to the economy. The market for skipjack tuna is controlled by a four processing licenses.71
On the contrary, yellowfin tuna is not regulated through similar licenses. Interestingly, these
two market segments have evolved in a very different manner. For skipjack tuna, the catch
volumes have plummeted, the tuna is largely exported as raw commodity to intermediary
markets and its export price is low and volatile. On the contrary, the (unlicensed) market for
yellowfin tuna has a different pattern of development, with rapid growth in catch volume,
development of 12 EU-certified processing facilities, which give it access to final markets,
and a more stable and higher export price (estimated at 2.5 higher than that of skipjack tuna,
Figure 54). Accordingly, governance issues seem to influence the development of fisheries,
including the industry’s ability to reap the value of the country’s stocks and develop ancillary
processing industries, as well as the levels of investment that the private sector undertakes
in the fisheries industry. The very different development trends of the licensed and the
unlicensed market segments call into question the need and/or the suitability of the current
licensing framework for skipjack tuna. If licenses for processing are maintained, it appears
necessary to revise the licensing process in order to ensure that: licenses are granted in a
transparent and competitive manner, and; the selection criteria for licensees emphasizes
technical and financial capabilities as well as fit-for-purpose considerations.

Environmentally friendly fishing methods for tuna have enhanced Maldives’ ability to access
premium markets. The Maldivian pole-and-line fishery is one of the largest coastal fisheries in
the Indian Ocean, and is estimated to account for 18-20 percent of the total catch of skipjack
tuna in the region72 . The fishery received considerable attention as a potential model for coastal
states, owing to both its commercial success and its adherence to ecological best practices. Poleand-line fishery has been promoted for its environmentally friendly nature73. That has enabled
a pathway to the export-markets of Europe and allowed it to extract a premium compared to
other similar fisheries. However, it is important to note that while pole and line fishing is deemed
environmentally friendly due to low by-catch, it does not prevent over-fishing, which has indeed
been a problem (see below).
However, the sustainability of fisheries is jeopardized by inadequate fisheries management. Tuna
and reef fisheries are either fully or over-exploited and catches are stagnating or declining as
mentioned above. Destructive fishing methods (especially for reef fish) and over-exploitation of reef
fish74 also raise issues of sustainability. This is mostly due to sub-optimal fisheries management,
environmental change resulting in increased sea surface temperature, and the estimated high
levels of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone. Development
and management of capture fisheries is governed by the Fisheries Law of Maldives. However, the
emphasis of the law is mainly on protecting local fishers and the sovereignty of Maldivian waters,
with less consideration of fisheries management. Other than two tuna fisheries, there are currently
few management measures in place for the local harvesting sector. Some important steps have,
however, already been undertaken: a fisheries licensing scheme75 was introduced in 2010, and
the Environmental Protection and Conservation Act contains provisions to limit fishing for the
conservation of biological diversity through 33 protected areas and natural reserves.

In 2012, the Maldivian skipjack tuna fishery successfully completed the process of official certification by the Marine Stewardship
Council (MSC) recognizing the best practice nature of this fishery.
The sustainability of reef fish is threatened by three factors, namely: a) the tuna fishery in Maldives is heavily dependent on the
coral reefs for bait. For every 7-10 kg of tuna caught, a kilogram of live bait is required, suggesting a bait conversion ratio of 8:1 on
average; b) anecdotal evidence identifies negative impacts of bait fishing on the ecosystem due to removal of juvenile reef fish and
on physical environment due to anchoring pole-and-line boats in coral areas; and c) demand for reef fish has increased threefold
in the last 15 years with the increasing demand coming from tourist resorts and export industry. Source: Marine Research Centre,

According to the “Licensing regulation for fishing, processing and aquaculture intending for export” every fisher intending to export
fish or sell to an exporter is required to get licensed under the regulation. The license is renewed annually after paying a nominal fee

tuna fisheries as well
as tourism.

and diversification,

Overfishing of reef fish is a risk to the sustainability of the tuna fisheries as well as tourism. The
sustainability of reef fish is threatened by three factors: (1) The tuna fishery in Maldives is heavily
dependent on the coral reefs for bait. For every 7-10 kg of tuna caught, a kilogram of live bait is
required, suggesting a bait conversion ratio of 8:1 on average76 ; (2) anecdotal evidence identifies
negative impacts of bait fishing on the ecosystem due to removal of juvenile reef fish and on
physical environment due to anchoring pole-and-line boats in coral areas; and (3) demand for
reef fish has increased threefold77 in the last 15 years, with the increasing demand coming from
tourist resorts and export industry. While there are no reliable statistics to validate over-fishing of
reef fisheries, if overfished the health of the coral reef ecosystem (a major touristic attraction) can
be significantly affected. If unchecked, there is a high potential of over-fishing, which could result
in exhausting of stocks as experienced for giant clam fishery in 199078 and the near collapse of
sea cucumber fishery in 1997. Fishery bans were imposed on black coral, giant clams in 1991,
turtles in 1995 and sharks in 2010. However, there is little adequate monitoring to ensure the
effectiveness of these bans.
The sustainability of fisheries is also threatened by climate change. Climate change impacts such
as dilution of seawater with the sea level rise and higher temperatures can result in the mortality
of corals. Changes in surface water temperature and ocean acidification can compromise the
calcification potential of coral reefs due to changes in the association between corals and their
symbiotic micro-organisms; hence, result in slow growth and productivity.79 Coral reefs are made
further vulnerable due to dependency of reproduction on environmental conditions. Similarly, tuna
is highly attuned to the biophysical conditions of the pelagic environment, particularly El Nino
Southern Oscillation and associated changes in surface sea temperatures. Recent observations
of changes in tuna aggregation and migration patterns observed is partly attributed to the rising
ocean temperatures and ocean acidification that are altering marine ecosystems and impacting
the fish distribution. Tuna movement and abundance in the Indian Ocean is closely linked to the
climate-change-driven ocean productivity.80
Threats to the health of the coral reefs that are significant to the fishery sector also come from
habitat degradation and loss due to pollution, harbor construction and reclamation. However, the
extent of the damage that these activities inflict on the health of coral reefs and marine species
has not been quantified (see also section on environmental sustainability).
In light of declining trends in the capture fisheries, marine aquaculture is nascent in Maldives and
can be an important source of economic growth and diversification, poverty alleviation and foreign
exchange earnings. With a view to diversifying the country’s fisheries sector, the government has
been implementing pilot aquaculture projects for a decade with pearl oysters, Maldivian clownfish,
and brown marbled groupers. A private aquaculture farm is also producing sea cucumbers,

producing the larvae in hatcheries before growing them in mangroves and lagoons. The future
development of aquaculture is however hindered by limited availability of financing and technology.
Operators are also expressing the need to better define the legal and policy framework to clarify
the business environment, develop the value-chains and facilitate longer-term investments and
research.

Agriculture
Maldives produces less than an estimated 10 percent of its food requirements, reaching selfsufficiency in fish only. All other staples are imported (Figure 55). As a result, food items account
for 21 percent of imports81 . Food imports are required not only to meet domestic food demand
for the Maldivian people but are also essential to cater to the tourism industry in Maldives. Outside
of Malé, fishing and subsistence agriculture are the main sources of food security and livelihoods
for the vast majority of the people. Except for coconut and fresh tuna, 90 percent of all food items
are imported.
Food security concerns have revitalized interest in the development of the local agriculture
production. Import dependency, limited storage facilities and ad hoc distribution pose food
security risks. In response to the recent food and fuel crises, Maldives has integrated food security
considerations into national planning. It has removed tariffs on imported food items, agricultural
inputs and fuel, and is looking for ways to intensify and diversify agriculture and fisheries. The
government is working with international agencies and private-sector partners to develop
agriculture by introducing new and innovative techniques and technology to strengthen the
contribution of farming to rural development.
Agriculture is a relatively minor activity in Maldives and has contributed only marginally to longterm growth. Agriculture accounts for 1.7 percent of GDP (even though its value has grown in real
terms over the past 20 years). Agriculture has traditionally been undertaken as subsistence crops
in 12 atolls, and only recently higher volume production has been developed (Figure 56).
Maldives total land area is around 30,000 hectares of which 4,000 hectares are estimated to be
arable. In 2013, approximately 50 islands large enough to support commercial agriculture activity
had been leased for agricultural production, spanning a total area of about 1,300 hectares.
Bananas, coconuts, fresh fruits and vegetables (papaya, eggplant, melons, pineapple and chilies)
are the main commercial crops produced locally in Maldives.

Maldives, however, faces a number of structural challenges and resource constraints that will limit
the country’s potential for agriculture development. Arable land is extremely limited and scattered
among many locations, inhibiting the horizontal expansion of farming areas and the achievement
of economies of scale. Soils are generally infertile or unsuitable for productive agriculture, requiring
high levels of supplemental fertilization. Fresh water resources for irrigation purposes are limited
and new irrigation technologies and technologies to desalinize seawater for agriculture production
purposes may be prohibitively costly. Start-up investments in high-tech agriculture, including
production facilities, storage and transport infrastructure, and the associated economic risks are
high as well. Ensuring predictable product quantities from smallholder producers and ensuring
product quality that meet expectations and standards of resorts will be challenging. Public R&D
and extension support systems will be costly to establish domestically (as opposed to R&D
systems in fisheries where the potential for expansion and take by private sector is significantly
larger). Given these constraints, Maldives will remain dependent on imports (and vulnerable to the
associated risk of price shocks) for most if its food demand into the future.

4. Sources of growth and shared prosperity (Contd.)

There are however, a number of opportunities to capitalize on agriculture for local income growth.
Though no official data exist, the linkages between local agricultural production and the tourism
industry are still limited. Anecdotal evidence suggests that concerns on volume, quality and reliability
of local production significantly reduce the incentives for resorts to source agricultural produce
locally, in favor of imports. In spite of that, market participants from both supply and demand
consider that there may be potential to further and more systematically exploit comparative local
advantage in the production of various fruits and vegetables to cater to the resorts (see section on
tourism). Such an emphasis may also have the added benefit of increasing women’s employment,
since agriculture has a predominantly female labor force (women represent 60 percent of total
employment in agriculture). Currently, mostly bananas, melons, papaya are produced locally for
resorts but it may be worthwhile to analyze more systematically what other high-value fruits and
vegetable are suitable for cultivation.

There are however,
a number of
opportunities
to capitalize on
agriculture for local
income growth.

In addition to broadening production choices and testing cultivation feasibility of a larger pool of
fruits and vegetables, the feasibility of low-cost smallholder greenhouse technologies combined
with household based-irrigation/ ‘fertigation’82 systems could be explored. Producer groups or
cooperatives of smallholders could help to bundle extension and marketing/ branding support,
including the operating of local collection, grading, cooling and storage facilities, as well as
transport to markets or consumers. Most likely, direct marketing arrangements between producer
groups and selected resorts will be the most viable model for high-value agriculture. Corporate
Social Responsibility schemes of international resort brands to promote community-based
organic agriculture could be explored with support from and in partnership with specialized NGOs
and government. Although there might be potential to strengthen the linkages between local
producers and the tourism sector through such arrangements, local producers will continue to
face production risks, as well as demand fluctuations due to the seasonality of tourist arrivals.

5. Constraints to growth and shared prosperity
Key Messages
Constraints to growth and shared prosperity include:
∫

Challenging investment climate constraining creation of new firms and growth of existing
ones

∫

Limitations in access to finance reduce the ability of the private sector to grow

∫

Governance shortcomings undermine the ability of the private sector to grow in a
sustainable and equitable manner and have hampered the ability of Maldives to maximize
the benefits from its natural resources as a foundation for shared growth

∫

Limitations of education sector and mismatch between supply and demand for skills.

∫

High, unsustainable and increasingly regressive social spending

Structural constraints

The geography and
population dispersion
in Maldives
creates a unique
set of structural
constraints, beyond
those experienced
by other small island
states.

The geography and population dispersion in Maldives creates a unique set of structural constraints,
beyond those experienced by other small island states. In line with other small island states, size
challenges limit Maldives’ production base and competitiveness (Box 4). The country is vulnerable
to external shocks. In fact, the volatility of its GDP growth is among the highest of all countries in
the world (Box 3). Similarly, Maldives has a narrow economic base (tourism and fisheries), and the
small size of the economy limits its ability to sustainably develop local production of other goods
or services, enhancing its reliance on imports. While the tourism resort industry is able to access
foreign capital through FDI and borrowing, most other sectors are not, thereby further limiting
their ability to grow. Beyond that, as opposed to many small island states, which are composed of
a single island, Maldives is a widely dispersed multi-island state with population disperse among
more than 190 inhabited islands.
As an illustration, island transport facilities are limited leading to high inter-island transport
costs and limited connectivity. Maldives’ islands are dispersed within 90,000 square kilometers of
territorial waters. As of 2005 only 105 inhabited islands (58 percent of all inhabited islands) had
adequate harbor and access facilities.83 As of 2011, 25 islands still had no harbor facilities.84 To
illustrate this point further, while transporting a 20-foot container from Singapore to Male would
cost about $1,200, the cost for transporting building materials to an island would be about the
same ($1,000-1,100) with additional costs incurred due to lack of jetty facilities in some of the
islands.85

As a result of these challenges, the cost of providing basic services in a fragmented country is
raised across the board, and public expenditure in Maldives is structurally high. Maldives’ public
spending is well above the level predicted for countries with a similar GDP per capita, although a
number of other highly dispersed island states (Kiribati, Micronesia, Marshall Islands and Solomon
Islands) have an even higher level of public spending (Figure 57). Indeed, when taking into account
its small size (leading to relatively high fixed costs of government), its insularity (a scattered
population across an archipelago increases the marginal cost of service delivery), the duality of
its economy (using taxing and spending to redistribute resort rents) and its openness (larger
government provides insurance against volatile incomes), Maldives moves closer to but still above
the predicted level of spending.

The small and dispersed population presents the country with a public service and infrastructure
dilemma. With its population dispersed over many islands across long distances, the country
faces the choice whether to address the challenge of the high cost of service delivery through
consolidation of population closer to Malé or through improving services and connectivity to
populations at their current locations. Each choice will generate different demands on public
services such as health, education and infrastructure, and will require a strengthening public
investment management capacity.

5. Constraints to growth and shared prosperity (Contd.)

Box 4. Small states challenges
More than 40 countries have a population under 1.5 million, out of which 26 are small island states.
These countries vary greatly in their level of development and the size of their economies. They
are also spread out geographically, with most of them clustered in the Caribbean, the Pacific and
in Africa. Despite their diversity, these countries share a common set of development challenges.
Size
Vulnerability to economic shocks and income volatility. Because of the small size of their
economies, growth strategies in small states rely on foreign markets. A high degree of openness
however means that they are heavily exposed to external shocks in global markets. Moreover, their
narrow resource base and small domestic markets prevent small economies from diversifying
into a wide range of activities, making them more vulnerable to terms of trade shocks. When one
dominant activity declines, it has an impact throughout the economy, exposing the population
to income volatility that can create additional hardships as the poorest are less able to weather
shocks to their incomes. Government revenues are also volatile because they rely more heavily
on taxing imports as a source of revenue. As tariffs are reduced, so is the government’s income.
Limited capacity. Because of their size, small states are traditionally face challenges in training
and retaining the right skills in the public sector. They also tend to have larger public sectors
than other countries. In some states, a widely scattered population adds to the challenge. Small
states also lack sufficient institutional capacity to participate fully in international fora, which can
profoundly affect their economies.
Difficulty accessing external capital. Access to global capital markets is important for small states,
and is one way to compensate for adverse shocks and income volatility. But private markets tend
to see small states as more risky than larger countries, so spreads are higher and market access
is more difficult.
Geography
Limited competitiveness. Three out of four of developing small states are islands or widely
dispersed multi-island states; others are land-locked, and some are located far from major
markets. Their remoteness and isolation make it difficult and costly for these states to access
world markets to compensate for small domestic markets — a situation that increases the cost of
intermediated inputs and imports and prevents efficiency and innovation. Domestic competition
is also limited, which hampers successful development.

78

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

Susceptibility to natural disasters and climate change. Most small states are vulnerable
to climate-change-related impacts and natural disasters such as hurricanes, cyclones,
droughts, and volcanic eruptions that typically affect an entire population and economy. The
impact on the government’s finances can be overwhelming, limiting a country’s ability to
build cushions for development programs and future needs.
A combination of a narrow production of export base combined with a vulnerability to shocks
can to lead to persistent fiscal and external imbalances and high levels of debt. Indeed,
among the 20 countries with the highest levels of public debt relative to GDP, small island
states account for 10 countries, and other small states for another three.

Meanwhile, there has been a steady migration of smaller to larger islands, in particular to the Malé
City area. Internal migration has happened for a long time, often in response to natural disasters,
including the 2004 tsunami, the difference in the cost of living (the high cost of food and other
goods and services in the atolls compared to Malé),86 quality of service delivery, and economic
opportunities. Recent data shows a net decline of population in many small islands; indeed, all
islands that lost population between 2006 and 2014 had a population below 3,000 in 2006 (Figure
58). During that period Malé and Hulhumalé saw increases in population of 37 percent (by 34,524)
and 450 percent (by 12,903), respectively (see also section on Poverty).

Conditions of overcrowding in Malé show that there are limits to centering activity on Malé.
Between 2003 and 2010 household expenditure on housing, water and electricity in Malé more
than doubled, and overtook food and beverages as the single largest expenditure item. Between
2010 and 2013, the number of vehicles in Malé increased by 23 percent, and currently there are
about 36 vehicles per 100 inhabitants in Malé compared to 5.5 in the atolls excluding Addu City and
Hulhumalé. As noted earlier, Malé’s population density of 53,700 per square kilometer puts it well
ahead of large, densely populated cities, such as Mumbai and Dhaka (Footnote 3).
Successive governments, including the current one, tried to address the structural constraints,
while attempting to stem the net migration into Malé, through various programs of investment
and voluntary resettlement programs. The current government’s party manifesto for 2013-17
pledged to address these issues through a number of actions, including:87

In particular, Hulhumalé, an artificial island off Malé, has been constructed to relieve congestion in
Malé and to attract residents from islands with small populations. Reclamation of 188 hectares of
land and primary development took place between 1997 and 2004, leading to a population of just
over 1,000. A resident population of 60,000 is targeted by 2020.90 The next phase of development
consists of a further reclamation of 240 hectares, catering to a population of 100,000.91 The
president recently issued a call to residents of islands with small populations to migrate, as the
government is unable to meet the socio-economic needs of small islands.92
Beyond structural constraints, a number of shortcomings associated with investment climate,
access to finance, governance and human capital restrict the potential for existing economic
activities in Maldives to grow and for new ones to be created.

Investment climate
The investment climate in Maldives features important constraints for new entrepreneurs and for
the growth of existing firms. The investment climate in Maldives is much more challenging than
that of similar island economies and other South Asian countries. In 2015 Maldives ranked 116th
in the World Bank’s Doing Business ranking (out of 189 economies ranked). This ranking was two
places lower than the previous year, signaling a lower conduciveness of the investment climate in
the country as compared to other economies ranked. According to Doing Business rankings (Figure
59), while it is relatively easy to register a new firm in Maldives, there are significant deficiencies
in the enabling environment for that firm to start operations (register property, obtain electricity
connection, access finance), to grow its business (access finance, import and export) and to
resolve disputes or unwind operations in an orderly, swift and fair manner (enforce contracts,
protect investors and resolve insolvency). A comparison with other small island states highlights
the significantly higher challenges across the board in the investment climate in Maldives.

However, it is important to highlight the fact that the business environment obstacles faced by
firms in Maldives go beyond those areas identified by global indicators such as Doing Business.
Enterprises interviewed during the preparation of this diagnostic identified various other obstacles
in the investment climate in Maldives, including difficulties in accessing foreign currency,93 that
limit the ability of firms to operate, invest in foreign capital goods and trade. Other factors cited by
firms include sudden changes in the legal and regulatory environment taking place in absence of
sufficient consultation with private-sector stakeholders.

There are major gaps in the legal framework governing activities of private enterprise. A number
of issues have been identified94 that restrict the effectiveness of the legal framework governing
firms’ activities, including:
∫

The need to define basic legal foundations of a system of commercial justice in order to
reduce legal uncertainly. Courts function without a complete and adequate set of legal rules;
enforcement mechanisms were found to be non-functional; the system of appeals was
deemed to generate long delays; and there is lack of technical expertise and knowledge of
business concepts. There are no alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in place.

∫

Lack of clarity concerning legal sources further undermines legal certainty. The position of
Sharia law in the private law system has not been fully established; it is unclear whether the
laws governing commercial activities and Sharia law are compatible.

∫

Lack of basic regulation in the area of secured transactions and registration of rights. Legislation
regulating financial distress and insolvency was found to be incomplete and outdated. This was
also the case with a number of basic private law regulations, including contract law, tort law
and statute of limitations. In turn, the lack of adequate laws governing secured transactions
severely undermines the ability of the financial sector to provide credit to enterprises, as it
enhances the risk of losses in case of borrowers’ defaults due to unpredictable, lengthy and
costly legal resolution. These deficiencies contribute to reducing the availability of credit,
increasing its cost and enhancing the amount of collateral required by lenders.

Competition law and industrial property law are missing in Maldives. These are key elements
of the legal framework needed in order to ensure a level playing field and fair treatment of
investors. The absence of these laws likely undermines the ability of Maldives to attract and
retain investment beyond tourism.

Addressing investment climate shortcomings will be essential in order to enable the creation of
inclusive economic activities in Maldives. Evidence worldwide demonstrates95 that investment
climate hurdles reduce incentives for entrepreneurship, reduce the attractiveness of the country
as investment destination, foster informality and significantly affect the competitiveness of
enterprises. So far, in spite of the investment climate shortcomings, Maldives has been able
to develop a tourism industry leveraging the uniqueness of its natural resources. However,
investment climate deficiencies have played a significant role96 in preventing the development
of an ecosystem of local enterprises around tourism as suppliers of goods and services. That, in
turn, has translated into the current model whereby tourism remains largely an enclave industry.
Investment climate shortcomings also undermine the ability of the country to diversify its economy
through creation of new firms in new economic activities.
Governance issues contribute negatively to development of the private sector in Maldives. The
large state presence in economic activities (through SOEs) is not only a fiscal sustainability
concern, but it also undermines the ability of the private sector to flourish by crowding it out of
large segments of the market. This is demonstrated by a large number of SOEs that are mostly
loss-making (paragraphs 54 and 89), the large size of public workforce (Figure 35) that may lead
to higher reservation wages on the part of the domestic labor force (section on Human Capital),
and large public-sector borrowing that may be crowding out the private sector (paragraph 161).
This, together with the governance issues affecting tourism and fisheries (paragraphs 113 and
130), contribute to create a set of significant challenges to private enterprises that go beyond the
difficulties stemming from business regulation bottlenecks.

Investment climate and FDI
Maldives has been able to attract large volumes of FDI to tourism, but it has had limited
positive spillovers to the economy (Figure 59). The uniqueness of Maldives’ natural resources
has enabled the country to attract large (and frequently lumpy) amounts of FDI (Figure 60) in
spite of shortcomings in the investment climate. However, FDI inflows have been largely focused
on development of single-island resorts, with a very limited proportion reaching sectors of the
economy that are associated with networks of production. In turn, this has contributed to the
current enclave model of the tourism industry. Going forward, as the country seeks to foster
economic diversification through foreign and local investment, its ability to attract FDI into other
industries or sectors will likely be affected by investment climate challenges.
95
96

World Bank (2015c)
Anecdotal evidence collected through interviews and consultations with stakeholders undertaken during the preparation of the SCD
coincide on the view that investment climate shortcomings have had a major negative impact on entrepreneurship in Maldives.
However, the lack of statistics including recent business surveys significantly limit the ability to substantiate these views.

Access to finance constraints
Access to finance has been identified as a major constraint for the development of enterprises in
Maldives. A World Bank survey of enterprises99 in Maldives in 2005 found that 66 percent of firms
identified access to finance as the most significant constraint to firms’ growth. While these figures
are admittedly old, other recent statistics and anecdotal evidence suggests that the situation has
not improved since then. Indeed, a business survey by Ministry of Finance in 2013 found that up to
70 percent of companies in manufacturing have difficulties accessing finance (Figure 61). Similarly,
views expressed by private-sector participants during interviews and consultations undertaken
during the preparation of this diagnostic highlighted significant difficulties in accessing finance,
which restricts their ability to make long-term capital investments as well as to finance working
capital requirements for day-to-day business (Figure 62).
Financing to the private sector has been lower than the pace of economic growth. Credit to the
private sector as a proportion of GDP decreased from 69 percent in 2008 to 44 percent in 2013, a
proportion that is much lower than that of economies with similar income level (Figure 63). These
economy-wide aggregate figures support private-sector stakeholders’ perception of a narrowing
availability of financing to private enterprises and entrepreneurs beyond tourism.

Recent events have the potential to undermine the confidence of foreign investors on Maldives
and reduce its competitiveness as a long-term investment destination in favor of jurisdictions that
can provide a higher degree of certainty to foreign investors. A recent survey of global investors
identified the main factors that drive selection of investment destinations. After macroeconomic
stability, the second most important factor for global investors97 when selecting an investment
destination is political risk98. Recent events in Maldives – including civil disturbances in Malé;,a
high-profile dispute related to a contract for investment in the international airport, and anecdotal
evidence reported in international media of radicalization and urban violence – have the potential
to undermine the attractiveness of Maldives to foreign investments, including PPPs.

In this context political risk includes adverse and abrupt regulatory changes, breach of contract, transfer and convertibility restrictions, civil disturbances, expropriation and acts of war and terrorism.

And some sectors of the economy are more affected than others. As discussed above, while
70 percent of manufacturing firms surveyed reportedly have difficulties accessing bank credit,
this proportion is much lower for other sectors such as construction (50 percent) and trade (32
percent). None of the firms in tourism surveyed reported difficulties in accessing finance. This is
consistent with the breakdown of banks’ credit portfolio, which is highly concentrated in tourism
and, to a lesser extent, in commerce, while tradable sectors account for a marginal proportion of
bank loans (4 percent for fisheries, 2 percent for manufacturing and 0.1 percent for agriculture).
Moreover, credit growth has recently been driven by lending to real estate and commerce, while
credit to tradable sectors has decreased substantially since 2007 (Figures 64 and 65). A breakdown
of banks’ portfolios by size of the borrower is not available, but anecdotal evidence suggests that
large enterprises (both public and private) enjoy easier access to bank credit than SMEs and small
entrepreneurs.

High collateralization requirements represent major hurdles to borrowers. Companies surveyed in
2006100 reportedly were required by banks to post collateral amounting to more than 150 percent
of the value of the loan on average101 . Views collected through interviews and consultations during
the preparation of this diagnostic confirm that high collateral requirements still represent a
significant obstacle to credit, especially for SMEs and new entrepreneurs.
Lack of access to finance has been identified by authorities as a major obstacle for entrepreneurship
in Maldives, but this challenge will not be resolved through concessional credit. Enhancing access
to finance for entrepreneurs is one of the priority areas under the Government Manifesto as well
as in the draft National Development Strategy. The government’s 2009-2013 National Strategic
Action Plan also recommended that the government provide women with self-help grants for
small- and medium-sized enterprises and promote microcredit programs. This focus was intended
to help bridge the disadvantage women face in accessing credit. For instance, in 2011 only onethird of the Bank of Maldives borrowers for development schemes or loans and advances were
women.102 In response to the lack of access to finance for entrepreneurs overall in Maldives, the
government had put in place a program to provide financing to young entrepreneurs. The program
(GETSET) considered the provision of non-collateralized loans with subsidized interest rates. While
the ultimate objective of the program (enhancing access to finance for entrepreneurs) is laudable,
it does not address the shortcomings limiting the adequate functioning of the financial sector
and thus does not represent a lasting or sustainable solution to the needs of enterprises and
entrepreneurs. On the contrary, concessional directed lending programs often aggravate access
to finance deficiencies by helping erode the credit culture in the population, reducing incentives
for established commercial lenders to innovate, and crowding out the financial sector by creating
dependence of entrepreneurs on subsidized interest rates.

to further identify
obstacles and
opportunities, as
well as to prioritize
actions.

Governance

ability of Maldives
to maximize the
benefits from its

as a foundation for
shared growth.

Sustainable enhancement of access to finance in Maldives will require the development and
implementation of a strategy for financial sector development that addresses the shortcomings
faced by the sector. The factors limiting the willingness and ability of financial intermediaries to
provide credit on a sustainable and fair basis to the various sectors of the private sector are wideranging. Included in Table 2 is a list of shortcomings that have been identified in the past103 that
illustrate the range of challenges facing the sector, including deficiencies in the legal framework
governing credit activities, shortcomings in credit infrastructure and underdeveloped financial
institutions. However, this list is not exhaustive and additional factors may be at play. Enhanced
public-private dialogue between all stakeholders (authorities, financial institutions and borrowers)
will be needed in order to further identify obstacles and opportunities, as well as to prioritize
actions. These issues are addressed in more detail in Annex 3.

Governance constraints
Maldives is facing important governance challenges that affect the business environment and the
soundness and sustainability of economic and fiscal management. Overall, an indeterminate but
significant connection between a few parties and the political system – related to the absence of
basic legislation in many areas, including procurement – and a lack of legal clarity weigh on the
economic activity. In particular, a significant amount of procurement in the country is carried out
by SOEs and the Ministry of Health outside the scope of national rules and central government
controls, leading to doubts about whether public resources are spent in the most effective and
efficient manner. In the public sector, limited capacity, a complex institutional framework, and
inter-institutional conflicts also limit the ability of the state to support social and economic
progress. Institutional capacity remains much lower than that of an average upper middle-income
country.
Governance deficiencies have hampered the ability of Maldives to maximize the benefits from its
natural resources as a foundation for shared growth. Significant governance constraints appear
to have undermined the development of the two main industries in the country (tourism and
fisheries). These shortcomings appear to have translated into sub-optimal investment, unrealized
potential for job creation and loss revenues for the government (see tourism and fisheries
sections). Deficiencies include: lack of transparency in allocation of licenses for exploitation of
natural resources; suboptimal selection of licensees, and: lack of mechanisms to minimize conflict
of interest (see paragraphs sections on tourism and fisheries).
Public-sector management suffers from inefficiencies. The public sector plays an important role
in Maldives’ overall economic model in redistributing some of the rents generated by the resort
sector to the rest of the population. This is done both through transfers and directly in the form
of relatively large public employment in both civil administration and state-owned enterprises.
In both cases there are significant inefficiencies that undermine both the effectiveness of the
103

World Bank, (2011a)

87

5. Constraints to growth and shared prosperity (Contd.)

redistributive model and the fulfillment of public-sector functions in service provision and
regulation. With civil service skewed towards relatively young workers, its effectiveness is far lower
than what might be expected of a middle-income country. Public financial management suffers
from inadequate accounting and poor cost controls.

There are
fundamental gaps
in law, including:
the lack of a civil
procedure code;
non-functional
enforcement
mechanisms; a
system of appeals
that generates long
delays, and; weak
capacity among
judges, particularly
on commercial
matters.

The unsettled political and institutional framework impairs the state’s effectiveness. Maldives has
been undergoing a contentious political transition for the past 10 years. The 2008 Constitution
created an extensive set of governance institutions and confrontational elections characterized
by interference of state bodies that has undermined credibility. Branches of government and
independent commissions are frequently in conflict, reflecting the interests of individuals in what
is a sharply divided polity. The lack of political and institutional settlement diverts the attention
of the state from carrying out public-sector functions and prompts decision-making driven to an
unusual degree by short-term political issues.
This has led in particular to weak rule of law. Maldives’ legal system is based on several foundations,
including both common law and the sharia, with lack of harmonization evident in much legislation,
particularly for commercial activity. There are fundamental gaps in law, including: the lack of a civil
procedure code; seemingly non-functional enforcement mechanisms; a system of appeals that
generates long delays, and; weak capacity among judges, particularly on commercial matters.
Uncertainties about the legal framework are amplified by the diverse legal backgrounds of judges
(all judicial education is obtained outside of Maldives), which leads to inconsistency in adjudication.
More generally, while the 2008 Constitution provided grounds for strong independence of the
judiciary, the composition of the judicial service commission has led to strong politicization of
the courts according to many observers (most notably the UN Special Rapporteur on Judicial
Independence). The judiciary has been highly proactive in recent political and electoral disputes.

Human capital constraints
Expanding and improving human capital will be of vital importance to promote economic prosperity
and increase jobs for young people. The country ranked only 103rd in the Human Development
Index for 2014, which is low for a middle-income country approaching $9,900 GNI per capita.
Maldives has performed well in providing access to primary and lower secondary education, but
there is room for improvement. The primary gross enrollment rate is 104 percent and the primary
net enrollment rate 99 percent. The lower secondary gross enrollment rate is 107 percent (Figure
66), while the lower secondary net rate is 82 percent. This suggests that, while participation in
primary and lower secondary education is high, there is considerable grade repetition and early/
late entry, especially in lower secondary education. The country needs to improve the internal
efficiency of the education system.

The country lags sharply behind in education attainment at the higher secondary level. The
gross higher secondary net enrollment rate is about 35 percent (Figure 67). This is very low by
international standards. The average higher secondary gross enrollment rate for middle-income
countries is 61 percent, and for upper middle-income countries 76 percent. The main reason for
the low enrollment in higher secondary education in Maldives is the limited number of schools that
offered grades 11-12 until recently, although almost each atoll has at least one school providing
higher secondary education. The government has now expanded this number to 51 schools: three
schools in Malé and 48 schools in the atolls (Figure 67). Many of these schools are over-crowded
and congested and require more facilities and equipment. In addition, higher secondary schools
require greater management and leadership capability, and the professional development of
teachers. At present, the higher secondary school system relies heavily on human resources from
overseas.

Higher education participation is extremely low for a middle-income country. The gross higher
education enrollment rate is only about 6 percent in Maldives, (Figure 67) whereas the gross
higher education enrollment rate for middle-income countries is around 30 percent. The low
proportion of Maldivians with higher education qualifications means that the country lacks
sufficient professionals, managers and technical experts to support economic growth and social
development. The main reasons for the low enrollment in higher education are: (1) the small
number of students completing higher secondary education and moving onto higher education;

89

5. Constraints to growth and shared prosperity (Contd.)

and (2) limited access to higher education in the country. Higher education is mainly provided
by Maldives National University (MNU) and about seven private higher education institutions.
However, over 85 percent of enrollment in these private higher education institutions is actually in
pre-degree level diploma and certificate programs. A considerable proportion of enrollment in the
MNU, too, is in pre-degree level qualifications.

Student-teacher ratio

The quality of education at all levels is a major challenge facing Maldives, both in terms of inputs
and outcomes. The teacher-student ratio varies between 6 (Vaavu Atoll) and 16 (Malé), but lower
teacher-student ratios tend to be associated with a larger share of untrained teachers (Figure 68).
At the same time, learning outcomes in primary and secondary education are low. The average score
for English among students at grade 4 is just 32 percent, and the average score for mathematics
only 39 percent. At grade 7 the average score for English is merely 29 percent, while the average
score for mathematics is just 30 percent. These very low averages show that learning levels in both
primary and lower secondary education are weak. There are also substantial regional disparities
(Figure 69). Learning outcomes are considerably higher in Malé than in the atolls, especially in a
subject such as English language, which is vitally important for employment in a tourism-based
economy. The low levels of cognitive skills results in poor performance of students at national
examinations. For instance, at the General Certificate of Examinations (GCE O/L) only about 40
percent students pass in five subjects, while just 19 percent students pass in eight subjects.

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

High youth unemployment is linked with skills deficiencies. The share of the labor force ages 1524 without work but available for and seeking employment was 27 percent in 2013. The average
youth unemployment rate for upper middle-income countries is 14 percent. Due to the lack of
well-educated Maldivians the country also faces a severe shortage of qualified personnel for
technical, and middle and senior management, jobs. According to private-sector stakeholders
consulted during the preparation of this diagnostic (Annex 2), the above-mentioned deficiencies
in “soft skills” together with shortcomings in technical and vocational education contribute to the
high level of expatriate workers, especially for up-market tourism and commercial and financial
activities.
The quality of existing TVET services needs to be improved so that it becomes both more attractive
for youth and more relevant for employers. The government has established the Technical and
Vocational Education Program (TVET) with aim of creating a skilled workforce that meets labor
market demands. The program has been diversified to offer training in hospitality and tourism,
construction and building, agriculture, electrical wiring and engineering and handicrafts. There
are more than 80 training providers in the country. However, the quality of these TVET programs
is considered limited and youth graduating with technical and vocational qualifications can face
lengthy job search periods. Another important constraint is that technical and vocational education
and training is considered an inferior option to academic qualifications by Maldivian youth, so that
the demand for TVET is limited. The education and training system has not yet developed career
guidance and counseling to help youth identify their aptitudes and talents, nor a method to stream
students into knowledge and/or skills-based programs depending on these aptitudes and talents.
One possible experiment that could be further studied in this regard is the Ministry of Education’s
UFAA program, which attempts to connect high schools, counselors and employers, and provide
at-risk youth the technical and soft skills to enhance employability.
The gap between youth aspirations for employment and the actual opportunities for employment
needs to be addressed. The rapidity of economic growth for Maldives has altered the perceptions of
the ‘ideal’ desired job for today’s youth. Qualitative data reveal that young educated Maldivian men

and women – and their households – aspire to white-collar, high-paying jobs and are unwilling to
settle for the perceived lower-status (if not lower-paying) jobs in fisheries or other non-white-collar
sectors. Financial pressures on unemployed youth are deemed to be reduced through parental
support even for unemployed adult children. These factors create a high reservation wage for youth.104
Parents supporting a large family do not, in turn, feel any financial pressure because of government
subsidization of daily necessities, such as basic food items, fuel, electricity and education. Thus,
parents have little motivation to temper their own high aspirations and pressure their children to
settle for a job that may be less than ideal. In Maldives and elsewhere this phenomenon is referred
to as ‘voluntary unemployment.’105 The resultant high youth unemployment might inhibit Maldives’
future growth trajectory and the ability of its development to be inclusive.

Social spending constraints
Maldives’ geography and polarized population distribution throughout the archipelago contribute
to high cost of service delivery. Maldives’ population is scattered over 194 inhabited island over an
archipelago of more than 800 kilometers in length. Guaranteeing access to services throughout
this territory is further complicated by a very polarized distribution of the population, characterized
by high density in the capital area Malé, which is home to two-thirds of the population, and very
low density in the atolls.106 In 2014, education and health services together accounted for 22
percent of total government spending. Maldives is the country in South Asia spending the highest
share of GDP on health and education (Figures 70 and 71). Interestingly, and despite a spending
on education that is significantly above international average, the Maldivian government has been
so far unable to improve access to secondary education and address outstanding learning and
education-quality issues.

Maldives lacks a comprehensive, effective and efficient system of social protection. Maldives’
safety net programs have undertaken major changes since the government’s Strategic Action
Plan 2009-2013 was drawn up.107 While tremendous progress has been made towards adding
new programs and expanding coverage of existing ones, Maldives is still far from its policy goal
of transforming fragmented social safety net programs into a comprehensive social protection
system. Universal subsidies on food and electricity and universal health insurance represent
the bulk of social expenditure together with social pension (Old Age Basic Pension) and Senior
Citizens Allowance (Table 3). Smaller safety net programs include disability and single parent
allowances.108 Poor targeting and weak coordination in administration greatly reduce the potential
impact of safety net programs and challenge their fiscal sustainability and, ultimately, the quality
of assistance to those most vulnerable.
The increase in spending on universal subsidies is a challenge to shared prosperity and poverty
reduction in Maldives. As discussed in Chapter 2, Maldives’ performance in reducing poverty and
boosting shared prosperity has been lackluster. While there is no recent poverty data to confirm this
hypothesis, the increase in public spending during the past few years might not have contributed
to better poverty and shared prosperity outcomes, especially because most of the increase has
been driven by spending on universal subsidies.109 In fact, as revealed in the poverty and social
impact analysis, while the poor spend a significantly higher share of their budget on food and
utilities, the rich benefit the most from universal subsidies due to their higher levels of consumption
(Figures 72 and 73). Because of their inherently regressive nature, universal subsidies represent
an inefficient instrument for guaranteeing affordability of basic needs for the poorest segments
of the population. Nevertheless, lacking a coherent safety net system explicitly targeting the poor,
universal subsidies are the only mechanism of “income support” currently available.

Following this policy framework, the government has passed three legislations governing specific social protection interventions –

According to the Social Protection Act, the government is also responsible to provide assistance to citizens for psychiatric treatment, water bill, housing, education needs, and whose small or medium sized business is facing a difficult incident.

Moreover, recently introduced social insurance schemes have created perverse economic
incentives that challenge poverty reduction and shared prosperity moving forward. While the
introduction of universal health insurance (Aasandha) has benefited disproportionally the poorest
segments of the population,110 poor design and limited implementation capacity have contributed
to increasing utilization trends and escalating costs that challenge its future fiscal sustainability.
Similarly, the generosity of the pension system has exacerbated inter-generational equity issues
and potentially contributed to increase distortions on the labor market. In particular, increasing
trends for inter-generational transfers within the household and increasing reservation wages
might challenge direct participation of the youth in the growth process (as noted above) and add
to fiscal and social sustainability concerns moving forward.111

6. Opportunities and trade-offs for sustainable
poverty reduction and shared prosperity
The Systematic Country Diagnostic aims to identify the most important opportunities and
obstacles to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Maldives. Based on evidence presented
thus far and analysis conducted as part of this Systematic Country Diagnostic, this section creates
a framework to identify the highest priority areas for reform and lays out a potential path forward
for shared and sustainable growth and poverty reduction in Maldives.
The identification of the priorities areas is the result of a three-step process. First, during the
concept stage, hypotheses on the functioning of Maldives’ development model and on the drivers
of its vulnerabilities were formulated, and knowledge gaps identified. Second, during the SCD
development stage, these hypotheses were confirmed by additional analysis and knowledge gaps
filled whenever feasible under the given timeline. Third, consultations with local stakeholders were
used to further validate hypotheses and analysis (Annex 2).

Enabling the local
population to seize
opportunities for
entrepreneurship will
require addressing a
host of factors that
combined represent
the overall enabling
environment in the
country.

Priority area 1: Enhancing opportunities for the local population to benefit from existing industries.
Enhancing these opportunities would contribute to poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
However, the impact may not be immediate and indeed relies on improving infrastructure, training
and regulations, among other things. It also could reduce social risk by improving employment
opportunities for the most vulnerable segments of the population, notably for youth and women.
Actions under this pillar appear politically feasible as both the current and the previous government
have endorsed reforms in both sectors to make them more inclusive.
Priority area 2: Enabling opportunities for creation of new sources of growth. Enabling the local
population to seize opportunities for entrepreneurship will require addressing a host of factors
that combined represent the overall enabling environment in the country. These factors include:
minimizing the regulatory burden and consequent cost to doing business; enhancing the ability
of creditworthy firms and entrepreneurs to access finance; and enhancing human capital through
the formation of professionals and technicians with the skills that are in demand and are the key
to better jobs. These priorities are discussed below.
Priority area 3: Improving efficiency and efficacy of public resource management and reducing
macro fiscal risk. Addressing the challenges identified in this priority area would make the economic
model in Maldives more sustainable and resilient to shocks. More directly, better management of
public resources would free up space to benefit the poor and increase opportunities for the youth
through, for example, better education. The impact of reform of subsidies and the public wage bill
would have an immediate and medium-term impact on fiscal sustainability, but they require both
careful planning to mitigate the negative impact on the poor and political courage. Improving the
preparedness for disasters and climate change would have a medium- to long-term impact.
The analysis identified governance and labor market as a fundamental cross-cutting issues
constraining growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Maldives. Governance and labor

market issues are at the heart of many of the constraints that challenge the inclusiveness and
sustainability of Maldives’ socio-economic model of development. A strong public-sector presence
in key sectors of the economy and a lack of transparency and accountability in SOEs’ management
negatively impact fiscal sustainability as well as private sector’s ability to flourish. Moreover, the
weakness of the overall legal framework together with the poor management of the country’s
natural assets challenge the sustainability of the economic model moving forward. Similarly,
labor market distortions and an increasing mismatch between labor demand and supply make it
harder for the growth process to be inclusive and put the social contract at great risk. Given the
fundamental role played by governance and labor market constraints, the SCD has identified the
need to fill existing knowledge gaps in these areas to more effectively identify policy priorities
moving forward.

Priority area 1. Sharing prosperity - Enhancing
opportunities for the local population to benefit from
existing industries
Opportunities and obstacles to enhance inclusiveness of
tourism growth

Growth in itself
will not be enough
to ensure the
inclusiveness of the
tourism industry.

Adequate planning
and transparent
implementation of
resorts development
can help to enhance
the benefits for the
economy as a whole.

Given the importance of tourism in Maldives, a more inclusive industry represents a major
opportunity for shared prosperity going forward. Maintaining underlying growth of tourism will
be a key factor for the sustainability of growth in the economy as a whole. However, growth in
itself will not be enough to ensure the inclusiveness of the tourism industry and the realization of
its potential positive spillovers. There are four potential complementary avenues to enhance the
inclusiveness of tourism:
First: Enhancing the implementation of the current resort model. Adequate planning and
transparent implementation of resorts development can help to enhance the benefits for the
economy as a whole and result in positive spillovers for local communities by attracting reputable
international investors with extensive industry know-how and networks. Realizing this opportunity
will require, among other things:
∫

Holistic planning and implementation of integrated destination management components
(transport, infrastructure, skills training, marketing, economic clustering) to increase the
viability of new resort projects, particularly in outer atolls where there are higher incidences of
poverty.

∫

A more strategic and transparent approach to ensure that leases are awarded to reputable
investors with demonstrable track record in the tourism industry to enhance the viability of
new developments and lead to positive spillovers to the local communities.

∫

Transparency in the management of leases to avoid numerous non-performing leases.

The sustainability
of the growth in
guesthouses will

planning and
regulation of tourism
development in
inhabited islands.

Tourism generated
28,000 jobs in 2014,
only 40 percent of
which are filled by
Maldivian staff.

Strategic planning to reduce the risk of over-supply in key market segments.

Second: Enabling sustainable economic diversification within the tourism sector. Non-resort market
niches (e.g. guesthouses and safari boats) have demonstrated the viability of business models that
are more closely integrated with local communities, through local ownership, higher local employment
(deemed as high as 75 percent of total staff) and reportedly higher ability to mobilize women as part
of the workforce. These new market niches have also demonstrated the ability to co-exist with the
higher-end resorts, providing lower-cost options to other demand segments. Realizing this opportunity
will require, among other things:
∫

Destination planning and management. The sustainability of the growth in guesthouses will
depend on adequate planning and regulation of tourism development in inhabited islands. This
includes sufficient analysis of carrying capacities, consistent management of land-use plans and
a requirement for Environmental Impact Assessments. The absence of these foundations in the
most developed case (Maafushi Island) had led to an increasingly overburdened infrastructure
system (especially waste management), and, anecdotally, to property inflation and displacement
of local population.

∫

Better and more cost-effective infrastructure to mitigate the high cost of transport, which limits
the potential of new market niches to islands clustered close to the capital (as they cater to more
price-sensitive tourists). This would facilitate the development of new market niches in remote
islands, where poverty levels are higher.

Third: Enabling local employment. Tourism is a large and growing source of jobs. According to the
census, tourism generated 28,000 jobs in 2014, only 40 percent of which are filled by Maldivian staff.
By 2015 the industry was deemed to generate 31,000 jobs. The implementation of industry growth
in line with government plans would imply an additional demand for 3,300 new employees in the
mainstream resort industry112. Despite a government-imposed quota requiring at least 45 percent
of staff to be Maldivian, the tourism industry consistently reports significant difficulties finding and
retaining qualified local staff. Unlocking the access of Maldivian population to more and better jobs in
tourism will require addressing a number of factors, including:

A closer collaboration
between the

institutions and the
private sector may
help to enhance the
relevance and quality
of the technical
training provided by
TVET.

∫

Establishing a partnership between the government and the private sector to identify and address
the obstacles to local employment. The normative approach (government-imposed quotas) to
enforce localization of employment has not lead to a sustainable inclusiveness in the tourism
industry. Anecdotal evidence suggests that local employment in the industry is lower than the
government-imposed quota.113

∫

Improving the alignment between technical training and demand. Market participants interviewed
consistently highlighted a major gap between the quality and relevance of the technical training
provided by TVET and the demands of the market. This prompts many resorts to implement their own
trainee programs for local youth. However, the high cost of these programs and the high turnover
of trained local staff are incentives to hire experienced foreign staff. A closer collaboration between
the technical education institutions and the private sector may help to enhance the relevance and
quality of the technical training provided by TVET. That, in turn, could enhance the employability of
technical graduates while making it easier for the tourism sector to find qualified local staff.

∫

Addressing social perceptions that appear to limit the desirability of technical jobs within and
outside the tourism industry to young people. Anecdotal evidence collected through extensive
consultations with youth and private-sector stakeholders consistently identified social norms that
appear to prevent the willingness of the youth to get training and seek technical jobs in spite of
great demand from various industries for qualified technical staff. These norms appear to include
social conventions, family expectations and social media role models.

∫

Addressing transport limitations that restrict the ability of Maldivians living in inhabited islands to
commute to work in resorts. While many resorts provide accommodation to employees, anecdotal
evidence suggests that Maldivians place a high premium on the ability to live on their home
island and commute to work. Such evidence is supported by a much higher proportion of local
employment114 in resorts that are close to inhabited islands and with good transport connections.

∫

Mitigating social and structural barriers that restrict the ability of young women to work in the tourism
sector. Social norms dictating appropriate employment for young women contribute to making
families reluctant to allow young women to take tourism-related jobs because they would have
to travel from home to other islands and because the tourism sector is associated with “immoral
and unethical” practices.115 Structural barriers that further exacerbate familial unwillingness to
allow young women to work away from home include the lack of child-care or residential facilities
for employed women in the tourism sector. Women’s limited control of transportation adds an
economic hurdle to their ability to travel to resort islands for work.116

Fourth: Strengthening linkages between tourism and local providers of goods and services. The
tourism industry is a large and rapidly growing source of demand for goods and services. The
tourism sector’s demand for inputs represents a major opportunity for local producers. But at the

present time, given limitation in local supply, most of the goods are imported. The potential for
creation of supply chains between local producers and tourism industry is hampered by a number
of obstacles, including:

Shortcomings in
quality, quantity
and consistency
of supply affect

The fisheries sector

benefits for Maldives.

∫

Fundamental challenges to local supply due to the small size of the economy, limited
economies of scale, high dispersion of the population and high transport costs. However, there
is ample potential for production focused on specific products and crops, signaling the need
for specialization.

∫

Shortcomings in quality, quantity and consistency of supply affect the development potential
for many local producers. According to anecdotal evidence, previous attempts by cooperatives
and grower associations to enhance reliability and professionalism have failed to radically
improve the reliability of supply. In light of that, many tourism operators prefer to reduce
uncertainty through imports. A large proportion of agricultural products come from small
producers. Aggregation and coordination has been attempted by cooperatives and corporate
sponsors, but it remains challenging.117

∫

Limited collaboration between supply and demand of agricultural products. While there have
been some success stories in production in agricultural islands, of the 52 leased islands, only
eight are actually operating, signaling potential missed opportunities for enhancement of the
local production. Further analysis of priority crop production, the calculation of supply and
demand, key constraints including inputs, logistics, knowledge and employment desirability,
and availability of land may help to enhance the certainty in supply.

∫

The fact that, at present, agricultural production throughout the country is centralized
in Malé due to lack of market places for fresh produce in other atolls118. This reduces the
competitiveness of local production by increasing transport costs and reducing the freshness
of products.

Opportunities and obstacles for unleashing the potential of
fisheries and ancillary industries.
Maldives has the opportunity to further develop its fisheries sector, and to capitalize on the potential
benefits to enhance economic growth and sustainable development at a national level. Unlike the
fisheries sectors in many countries throughout the world, Maldives has a range of factors in its
favor that provide the opportunity for further development. The fisheries sector can generate a
range of sustainable benefits for Maldives – direct benefits such as employment, income and food
for fish-workers and indirect benefits such as contributions to the national exchequer through
various fiscal mechanisms. Yet, significant challenges lay ahead to undertake sector development
within an economically efficient and sustainable fisheries management system.
Enhancing the governance of the sector will be necessary to unleash its potential. The development

Enhancing the
governance of the
fisheries sector will
be necessary to
unleash its potential.

Many countries that
once had ample
fish resources are
now faced with
overcapitalized
fishing fleets,
overfished stocks
and unsustainable
levels of public
subsidies to their
fishery sectors.

(a segment that does not have similar licensing in place) highlights two widely varying trends.
Where the licensed market segment is characterized by plummeting catch, low added-value
exports and declining employment, the unlicensed segment is characterized by increasing catch
volumes, high-value exports to prime markets and increasing employment. While other factors
may contribute to these trends, it is worth reviewing the governance framework in the sector,
including the rationale for licensing of particular activities and whether such framework has a
positive contribution to the economy as a whole. If licenses are maintained, a transparent licensing
process should be put in place with emphasis on ensuring that licenses are granted to the most
qualified enterprises with demonstrated ability to contribute to the sustainable growth of the
sector.
The sustainable and inclusive growth of the fisheries sector will likely not be based on increasing
the volume of catch. Currently, most of Maldives fisheries operate under free and open-access
conditions. The sector’s growth is based largely on traditional policy goals of maximizing
production through increased fish landings, supported by improved technology that can lead to
increased fishing yields. Global experience shows, however, that this approach usually results in
low levels of success in generating sustained economic benefits. In some cases, this leads to
reduced revenues form the fishery, diminishing profitably and, in the worst case, stock collapse
from overfishing119 and waste120. Many countries that once had ample fish resources are now
faced with overcapitalized fishing fleets, overfished stocks and unsustainable levels of public
subsidies to their fishery sectors.
A transition to a wealth-based fisheries management system may hold promise for the future.
Rather than pursuing the traditional goal of increasing fish landings, wealth-based fisheries
management systems focus on maximizing net returns in fishery-sector development within
an economically efficient fisheries management system. For inshore reef and lagoon fisheries,
such systems can involve the development of local community-based management systems. For
coastal and high-seas fisheries, such systems might be based around the design and introduction
of rights-based fishing within a sound management planning framework. These approaches
have worked well for other countries. However, it is important to note that a transition process
requires a careful implementation and a long-term planning horizon. Prudent management of the
marine environment also underpins the valuable tourism industry and the perception of Maldives
as a pristine environment. It is essential, therefore, to capitalize on emerging international best
practice in fisheries and reef management to ensure that Maldives’ fisheries management system
is economically efficient, sustainable and profitable in the future.

119
120

The classic example is the Canadian Atlantic cod fishery in the 1980s, culminating in the closure of the fishery in 1992, with massive economic costs to local fishers, processors, and governments. In Maldives, there are some indications of fleet overcapitalization in the tuna fisheries.
Another systemic issue is the logistical and capacity problems between harvesters and processors during peak fishing periods.

101

6. Opportunities and trade-offs for sustainable poverty reduction
and shared prosperity (Contd.)

There are a range of targeted options121 for exploiting the opportunities presented to the Maldives’
fisheries sector at present, but effective strategies and plans will need to be developed in order to
identify not only economic potential, but also environmental impact.

Enhanced and more
balanced stakeholder
involvement between
fishers, industry
and government in
decision-making
will help chart a
steadier course at
the national level.

∫

With tuna harvesting and processing, there are possibilities for developing new domestic
fisheries such as long-lining, and for re-organizing the current system for collecting and
buying fish to overcome seasonal gluts and enhance the share of returns for the producers
of (dried) Maldives fish. Onshore, there are possibilities for locating new processing and fishhandling facilities on different islands to take advantage of the seasonal changes in fishing
grounds and fish concentrations and new infrastructure, such as harbors and airports. The
impact of selecting a particular development option on local communities, on livelihoods and
on the economies of scale and logistics of the value chain will need careful consideration and
cooperation between both private and public actors.

∫

There are strong possibilities for developing new products and entering new markets, in
particular capitalizing on Maldives pole- and line-caught tuna as an individually caught,
‘ecologically-friendly’ product from one of the world’s cleanest environments. The culture of
high-value, small-volume products can also capitalize on the environmental image of Maldives.
But, international seafood markets are highly competitive and demanding, and Maldives will
need to exploit its comparative advantage for seafood exports by building a careful business
and investment strategy.

∫

There are opportunities for addressing infrastructure and logistical constraints that affect
some fishing islands. The trade in fish products will depend on better facilities and transport
links to access export markets, but investments will require sound financial and technical
assessments and close public-private cooperation including PPPs, particularly given the
government’s current fiscal situation.

∫

The need to increase stakeholder involvement in decision-making and policy implementation is
constrained by the overlapping mandates of different ministries. The lack of a clear definition
of the respective roles of the public and private actors has major implications for the longerterm functioning and effectiveness of the sector, especially in a transition towards a wealthbased fisheries management system. Enhanced and more balanced stakeholder involvement
between fishers, industry and government in decision-making will help chart a steadier course
at the national level. It is particularly imperative that fishers have a stronger voice in policy
development at the national level.

∫

Finally, the issue of international partnerships also presents options for Maldives. The extent to
which Maldives’ participation in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission has benefited the country
over shared stocks, and the options for entering into partnerships with foreign investors for the
further development of enterprises such as the tuna transshipping trade are the types of major
issues that need to be considered in the context of sectoral and national development policy.

121

102

These options stem from technical background analyses as well as stakeholders’ consultations.

Priority area 2. Enabling opportunities for creation of
new sources of growth

Enhancing the
enabling environment
will increase the
potential for
entrepreneurship,
creation of new
firms and growth of
existing ones.

Economic diversification and competitiveness in Maldives are hampered by significant structural
and spatial constraints, but enhancing the enabling environment will increase the potential for
entrepreneurship, creation of new firms and growth of existing ones. Maldives faces similar
structural challenges of other small island states that restrict the extent to which the country
can attain competitiveness across the board. However, as discussed in previous sections, there
are visible untapped opportunities where potential (in terms of existing demand and proved
production capacity) exists, both within value chains of existing industries, as well as potential
new economic activities.
Enabling the local population to seize these opportunities will require addressing a host of factors
that combined restrict the overall enabling environment in the country. These factors include:
minimizing the regulatory burden and consequent cost of doing business; enhancing the ability of
creditworthy firms and entrepreneurs to access finance, and; enhancing human capital through
the formation of professionals and technicians with the skills that are in demand and are the key
to better jobs. These priorities are discussed below.

Enhancing Investment Climate

Minimizing
unnecessary
regulatory hurdles
will be essential
in order to foster
entrepreneurship in
Maldives.

Enhancing the investment climate will be essential to facilitate entrepreneurship and attract
investment. As discussed in previous sections, the challenges related to the investment climate
are higher in Maldives than in other small island states and other countries in the region. Global
research documents extensively the negative link between investment climate challenges and
growth and competitiveness in the private sector. As the government of strives to enhance
entrepreneurship and economic diversification in the country, the opportunities for improvement
of the investment climate are significant, including:
∫

Reducing the cost of regulatory compliance. Global indicators such as Doing Business identify
a number of regulatory shortcomings that currently create additional transaction costs to
entrepreneurs at all stages of the business cycle (from firm creation and connection to basic
utilities, to expansion and resolution of disputes and insolvency). These deficiencies in the
regulatory framework have the potential to discourage entrepreneurship and to reduce the
overall competitiveness of enterprises. Minimizing unnecessary regulatory hurdles will be
essential in order to foster entrepreneurship in Maldives..

∫

Addressing shortcomings in the legal framework governing private-sector activities.
Deficiencies in basic legal foundations of the system of commercial justice create legal
uncertainty and diminish incentives for investment. Key elements of the legal framework
needed in order to ensure a level playing field and fair treatment of investors (competition
and industrial property laws) are missing, further undermining the confidence of potential new

investors. The lack of adequate laws governing secured transactions severely undercuts the
ability of the financial sector to provide credit to enterprises because it increases the risk of
losses in case of borrowers’ defaults due to unpredictable, lengthy and costly legal resolution.
Addressing these shortcomings in the legal framework, together with the capacity of the
judiciary to implement laws in a consistent and objective way, will be important to increase
investor confidence and provide entrepreneurs with legal certainty.
∫

Enhancing the participation of the private sector in the reform of the investment climate. While
global indicators provide a benchmark of some key areas of the investment climate, identifying
and addressing the key constraints faced by enterprises and entrepreneurs in Maldives will
require the active and continuous participation of the private sector. Development of a formal
public-private dialogue platform on investment climate can provide a channel for the private
sector to inform government policies and define priorities for reform. The close consultation
with private sector can also help to reduce the risk of disruption in enterprises’ operations from
sudden changes in laws and regulations.

∫

Addressing governance issues affecting the development of the private sector. In particular,
SOEs have the potential to crowd out private enterprises from major economic activities
through unfair advantages, including wider access to financial services, broader ability to
attract the limited human capital available in the country, and preferential treatment related
to business regulations. Rethinking the role of SOEs and the rationale for their participation in
economic activities that could be undertaken by private enterprises is necessary to ensure that
SOEs do not become an obstacle to entrepreneurship and private-sector-led growth.

Enhancing access to financial services
Improving access to adequate financial services will be essential to enhance the ability of
creditworthy firms and entrepreneurs to invest and reduce transaction costs. Enterprises and
entrepreneurs have identified access to finance as a major constraint for their day-to-day
operations and longer-term growth. The high dependence of banks’ credit decisions on real
estate collateral, together with the inability of mechanisms for entrepreneurs with viable business
plans to demonstrate their creditworthiness, has translated into concentration of credit in a
few segments of the economy, most particularly larger borrowers in tourism-related activities.
Recognizing these challenges, authorities in Maldives have tried to provide concessional credit
to foster entrepreneurship. However, sustainably enhancing access to financial services will likely
require addressing a range of factors that currently undermine the efficient operations of the
financial sector, including:
∫

Improving credit infrastructure. Enhancing the depth and scope of information included in the
credit registries will be necessary to increase the ability of lenders to identify borrowers with
good track records. The inception of an electronic collateral registry will improve the ability of
borrowers in remote atolls to post use their assets as collateral.

∫

Enhancing financial inclusion of population in remote islands. Development of mobile
banking will help the population in remote atolls to have access to basic financial services
and reduce the currently very high transaction costs of financial operations.

∫

Improving the legal framework governing financial activities. Lack of clarity and certainty on
application of laws translates into lengthy and costly legal processes. This increases the risk
aversion of lenders, which, increases the collateralization requirements. Losses stemming
from these deficiencies are passed on to new clients in the form of higher interest rates.
More clarity and consistent application of the laws governing foreclosure, together with
the clarification of the application of Shariah law in financial disputes will be necessary to
minimize uncertainty and risk aversion.

∫

Enhancing the development of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). NBFIs can increase
accessibility to financial services by reaching out to segments of the market not covered
by large commercial banks. Important types of NBFIs (including microfinance, leasing and
factoring) are currently either missing or underdeveloped in Maldives. Previous experience
in the country demonstrates the potential for some of these NBFIs, but also shows that
challenges in the legal framework contributed to diminish that potential over time. Creating
an enabling environment that fosters the orderly and sustainable development of NBFIs,
including adequate oversight, can enhance supply of financial services to currently underserved market segments.

Addressing human capital constraints
Expanding and improving human capital will be of vital importance to promote economic
prosperity and increase jobs for young people. From the demand side, enterprises have
consistently identified the lack of staff with the adequate skills and qualifications as a major
constraint to growth. Over the last few years, this has led to vast employment of expatriates.
From the supply side, young people in Maldives aspire to high-paid jobs, but often lack the
required skills. While there are various factors at play affecting the participation of youth in
employment, the gap between the skills demanded and those in supply is wide at the present
time. Reducing this gap presents a significant potential for shared prosperity, and will require,
among other factors, the following:
∫

Enhancing Maldivian youths’ ‘soft skills’. Soft skills (including workplace ethics and the ability
to collaborate effectively within an organization and be responsive to clients) are missing
from academic programs, but are widely identified as priorities for employers in the country.
Such skills often rank higher than technical skills as decision elements for employment.
The introduction of these skills in education programs will increase the employability of
the Maldivian youth and will likely have a positive impact on their contribution to firms’
productivity.

∫

Improving the quality and relevance of technical and vocational education. While Maldives has
a Technical and Vocational Education Program (TVET) in place, the quality and relevance of
the training provided has failed to meet the demands from the private sector. This, together
105

6. Opportunities and trade-offs for sustainable poverty reduction
and shared prosperity (Contd.)

with the prevailing perception of Maldivian youth that vocational education and training is an
inferior option to academic qualifications, has contributed to further lower the interest in TVET.
A closer collaboration between the private sector and TVET will be necessary to increase the
relevance of programs provided, and participation of industry experts may enhance the quality
of the degrees. Ensuring responsiveness of TVET and other relevant academic institutions
to the private sector will be necessary to unleash the potential for technical and vocational
education.
∫

The sustainability
of Maldives’
development model
is dependent on how
well the authorities
manage the country’s
wealth-generating
natural resources and
its financial assets
to redistribute this
wealth.

Enhancing participation and relevance of higher education. Enrollment in higher education
is much lower in Maldives than in countries of similar income level. The low proportion of
Maldivians with higher education qualifications means that the country lacks sufficient
professionals, managers and technical experts to support economic growth and social
development. Enrollment in higher education in Maldives is affected by the high dispersion in
population (with tertiary education provided mainly in Male), but other factors – such as low
completion rates in higher secondary education (which is provided in the atolls) play a role.
While enrollment in higher education will remain hampered by Maldives spatial constraints,
enhancing the relevance and quality of the programs will be essential to ensure that they are
responsive to the needs of the country.

Priority area 3. Improve public resource management
and reduce macro-fiscal risk
The sustainability of Maldives’ development model is dependent on how well the authorities
manage the country’s wealth-generating natural resources and its financial assets to redistribute
this wealth, and how resilient it is to external and domestic shocks.

Managing natural resources
Maldives’ natural resources are its marine life, coral reefs and its islands. As discussed earlier, there are
weaknesses in the exploitation of its natural resources and in its preparedness for natural hazards122.
∫

Continued population development will lead to more sewage and solid waste, which impacts tourism
and fisheries, and growing demand for clean water for island communities, a development that is
compounded by a growing competition between water for potable and irrigation purposes.

∫

Loss of coral reefs due to the warming of ocean water and pollution may result in the loss of bait
fish for tuna fisheries.

∫

In the tourism sector, de facto high barriers to entry and the lack of transparency in the allocation of
leases for resort islands makes it difficult to assess if the government maximizes the benefits from
its main natural resource.

∫

Environment and natural resource management issues are typically complex, often
uncertain and dynamic, and affect multiple sectors, organizations and individuals. As a
result, it requires strong leadership, a high degree of coordination, stakeholder involvement,
expertise and resources to ensure sustainability.

∫

Although there are multiple public institutions mandated to conserve and protect the natural
resources with backing of legal instruments, their overlapping roles, undefined relationships
and lack of incentive to coordinate have a negative impact on management effectiveness.

∫

Lack of funds, human resources and expertise are making enforcement weak. Poor
stakeholder involvement, especially local authorities and communities in management
efforts, reduces enforcement capability.

∫

Poor capacity of civil servants is impacting implementation and monitoring of policies,
strategies and programs. The private sector, which is the biggest beneficiary of natural
resources and who can play a significant role in bringing resources, monitoring and
managements, is playing only a limited role due to lack of opportunity and effort to
mainstream.

Managing public financial resources
The main mechanisms to redistribute the wealth generated by tourism are public sector
employment, social services, subsidies and transfers. The current system of redistribution has
contributed to achieving important development outcomes.

Manifesto of the Progressive Party of the Maldives.
Although health and education are not necessarily government activities, in Maldives about 90 percent of employment in the
health sector is in the public sector (Maldives Health Statistics 2013). In the education sector, about 70 percent of students are
enrolled in government schools (Maldives Statistical Yearbook 2013), and it is assumed that a similar percentage of teachers
are employed in government schools.
This does not include employment at SOEs.

6. Opportunities and trade-offs for sustainable poverty reduction
and shared prosperity (Contd.)

Sustainability of the
positive outcomes
achieved through the
redistribution system
crucially depends
on improving its
efficiency and costeffectiveness.

There is growing
evidence that the
expansion of access
to services to the
atolls has been
accompanied by a
decline in the overall
quality of service
provision.

∫

Public services, and in particular the expansion of education and health services provision
to populations living in the atolls, have contributed to a significant improvement of human
development outcomes and human capital accumulation.

∫

Electricity and food subsidies have contributed to mitigating the high cost of energy and
food supply in Maldives, thereby improving living standards of the population. Similarly, the
introduction of universal social pensions and health insurance have helped extend protections
against the challenges of old age and the risk of catastrophic health expenditure to the entire
population.

Apart from the food and electricity subsidies delivered through SOEs, capital contributions to
SOEs are another large public expenditure item. Although a few SOEs returned annual average
dividends equal to 1.8 percent of GDP between 2011 and 2014 to the budget, annual average
capital contributions to SOEs amounted to 1.3 percent of GDP over the same period.
However, sustainability of the positive outcomes achieved through the redistribution system
crucially depends on improving its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Given the already widening
fiscal deficits and high public debt, these mechanisms are not fiscally sustainable at current
trends, and the government will need to carefully weigh the fiscal costs and social benefits of each
of the expenditure items.
The public sector employment freeze contributes to managing the wage bills and improve fiscal
sustainability. A more structural solution, which could include a review of local government pay
structures and a public-sector-wide pay scale, could be helpful to ensure consistency of wages
and salaries across public service and drive public service reform.128 It is important that structural
reform be accompanied by efforts to improve conditions for employment in the private sector,
especially for women.
While it is important to continue to provide wide access to health and education services, more
careful planning based on the demographic distribution of the population could improve efficiency
of spending and free resources to improve quality. There is growing evidence that the expansion of
access to services to the atolls has been accompanied by a decline in the overall quality of service
provision.129 The failure to close the quantity and quality gap in service provision between Malé
and the atolls contributes to continued population migration toward the capital and exacerbates
the (per capita) cost of service provision in the atolls (Figure 74). Still, tailoring service provision
on the demographic profile of the population in the different parts of the country (Figure 75) could
result in significant cost savings and potentially free up resources to improve quality of service
provision.

IMF Article IV, January 2015.
The lack of supply of qualified medical and education professionals within the local Maldivian population, forced the central Government to rely on expatriate workforce for expanding service delivery outside Malé (Maldives Health Statistics 2013, Ministry of
Health; School Statistics 2014, Ministry of Education). However, high turnover and limited integration of these professionals with
the local population resulted suboptimal quality of service provision.

Targeting reform of electricity and food subsidies could improve efficiency of spending while
freeing resources to protect the poor. Building on international experience, a cut to explicit
subsidies would need to be accompanied by interventions to protect the most vulnerable
segments of the population, and to limit losses of utility providers. Such strategy would aim at:
(1) enabling consumption efficiency; (2) increasing supply-side efficiency; and (3) substituting
universal subsidies with a targeted transfers system. The government has already started to
target electricity subsidies by reassessing who is eligible to receive them.
Operational savings in Aasandha could cut its cost significantly, while preserving the principle of
universal health insurance. These savings could be achieved mainly through three channels: (1)
reducing the cost of medicines through the bulk procurement of essential and generic drugs;
(2) reducing expenditure on overseas treatment through negotiation of close-ended package
rates with providers; and (3) improving attention to early detection and secondary prevention of
chronic diseases at the primary care level, which will be helpful in slowing down disease progress
and delaying the occurrence of complications. Substantial capacity building of the National Social
Protection Agency would also be needed to plan, implement and monitor these reforms.130
Improving SOE governance could improve fiscal and environmental sustainability. The key sources
of fiscal risks include: (1) political interference in the management of the SOEs, in the form of
uncompensated subsidies, service requirements, and tolerance of soft budget constraints resulting
in inter-SOE debts; (2) lack of macroeconomic planning capacity, leading to potential losses as
macroeconomic variables develop differently than expected; and (3) management challenges,
such as lack of coherence between public sector and SOE investment plans. Procurement by SOEs
could be made more transparent to assess whether it delivers enough value for money. As SOEs
play a key role in many utility sectors (e.g., electricity, water and waste management), improvement
in their performance could also help alleviate some of the environmental constraints on growth.
130

Systematic costing, adequate autonomy at the facility level, and appropriate incentive mechanisms being put in place at the design
stage, to encourage high productivity and cost containment, would be pre-requisites for such reform. Improved information systems making possible continuous analysis of Aasandha’s administrative data would be important for internal controls and informing
ongoing reforms, as would be regular compilation and analysis of household survey data to periodically check on the scheme’s
performance and distributional implications.

6. Opportunities and trade-offs for sustainable poverty reduction
and shared prosperity (Contd.)

Increasing macroeconomic resilience
Better management of its resources may also make Maldives more resilient to external shocks
and help it mitigate risks. As a small island state Maldives is inherently vulnerable to external
shocks, and its heavy reliance on tourism adds a channel of exposure. Indeed, besides the
exposure it shares with other island states to natural disasters and commodity prices, Maldives is
also vulnerable to recessions in certain key tourism sectors and the indirect impact on tourism of
events such as the 9/11 attacks, Additionally, recent domestic unrest may lead to negative travel
advisories.

As a small island
state Maldives is
inherently vulnerable
to external shocks,
and its heavy reliance
on tourism adds a
channel of exposure.

While it cannot
eliminate its
vulnerability to
shocks, Maldives
has opportunities
to reduce its
vulnerability and
increase its resilience

Maldives will remain exposed to external shocks from tourism under its current development
model so it needs to decrease its vulnerability to other shocks and increase its resilience. In order
to analyze the options to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience, vulnerability is decomposed
into three parts: (1) exposure to shocks; (2) internal conditions that may amplify or attenuate
shocks domestically; and (3) risk management in the form of ex-ante institutional quality and expost policy space to mitigate the impact of shocks.131
∫

Exposure: Maldives is mainly exposed to external demand shocks through tourism, external
supply shocks from commodity prices and natural disasters.

∫

Internal conditions: Fiscal revenue is highly dependent on tourism, while a large part of public
expenditure is rigid and difficult to adjust. Combined with high public debt, this makes the fiscal
accounts also vulnerable to shocks. In addition, the country is structurally highly open to trade,
and any countercyclical fiscal policy would lead to more imports and potentially destabilizing
the external sector.

∫

Institutional quality: Maldives has low ratings for policies and institutions, in particular for fiscal
policy and for debt policy and management.132

∫

Policy space: The country has limited macroeconomic and fiscal space to deal with an external
shock. It has low usable official foreign exchange reserves,133 and it runs a persistent fiscal
deficit.

While it cannot eliminate its vulnerability to shocks, Maldives has opportunities to reduce its
vulnerability and increase its resilience within limits by:
∫

Diversifying sources of tourism. Maldives can try to diversify its sources of tourism by attracting
tourists from other parts of the world and by attracting more tourists to its guest houses and
other offerings outside resorts. Accessing different markets that are not perfectly synchronized
could reduce the current volatility of tourist arrivals. The added benefit is the guest-house
tourism is more inclusive for the local population (Priority area 1).

∫

Reducing reliance on imported fuel. Maldives is interested in introducing solar power to replace
imported diesel. With diesel imports accounting for around 20 percent of total merchandise

imports, this could have a significant effect on vulnerability to commodity price fluctuations.
Installing and maintaining solar panels could have the added benefit of providing local
employment for engineers. It should be noted that existing suppliers of diesel-based power
may initially try to hinder efforts to switch to solar energy until they make the switch themselves.
∫

Reforming in public expenditure. Reforms in the system of wages, subsidies and transfers
would make the budget more flexible to deal with revenue shocks without continuously
increasing public debt. Moreover, it could reduce overconsumption of subsidized electricity
and certain imported goods, which would reduce external exposure as well. However, this type
of reform may be politically difficult, and will need a social safety net (such as targeted cash
transfers) to protect the poorest.

∫

Decreasing risk of debt portfolio. As Maldives becomes richer, concessional external debt
may become less available. Public domestic debt has a very short maturity, and is subject to
refinancing and interest risk.134 Extending the maturity profile would reduce the risk but could
increase the cost of debt. There are natural buyers of longer-term public debt, such as pension
funds and insurance companies. Establishing a yield curve beyond one year could also help the
financial market better price risk, and it could deepen the financial market and make it easier
for local SMEs to obtain credit.

∫

Improving public sector governance and planning capacity. Improvements in public financial
management would lead to more credible budgets, expenditure controls, commitment to
decreasing public debt and better selection and planning of investment projects. Improvement
in planning capacity is needed to deal with the challenges of natural resource management,
and to address the dilemma between consolidating the population closer to Malé and improving
services and connectivity to populations at their current locations, and to plan the associated
infrastructure needs.

∫

Increasing policy space. The low level of usable foreign exchange reserves leaves little space
to manage the exchange rate and import essential goods. Mitigating this lack of space is
the existence of a parallel market with sufficient quantities of foreign exchange. The country
appears to have access to ad-hoc support from partners, but more formalized access to a
credit line would reduce macroeconomic uncertainty. Fiscal space can be built up by reducing
the budget deficit and reducing the level of public debt. As a dispersed island state with a
commitment to provide social services to remote atolls, Maldives faces limits to how much
expenditure savings can be made but, as explained in the previous section, there appears
to be scope for efficiency gains. On the other side of the balance, there may be scope for
increased revenue, including income tax revenue or a wealth tax, ideally from sources that are
less correlated with fluctuations in tourism.

134

In the current situation of apparent excess liquidity in the financial market and the absence of good investment opportunities in the
private sector, this risk seems to be low. Under the “tap” system for Treasury bills, which fixes interest rates, interest rate risk is also
low.

Annex 1. Poverty measurement in Maldives
Understanding of poverty issues in Maldives is limited by data quality and comparability constraints and by pitfalls in the
current poverty measurement framework.

Data limitations
The primary concern relates to data quality and comparability. The first household survey in Maldives (Vulnerability and
Poverty Analysis - VPA) was conducted in 1998/99, with a panel followup in 2003/04. The VPA survey series was then
replaced by Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) – mostly focused on household budget measurement –
which was implemented in 2003/04 and 2009/10. Differences in instruments and sample design do not permit comparison
between the results obtained from VPA and HIES surveys. Moreover, differences in survey instruments and possibly in data
quality within the two HIES rounds further limits the ability to profile the evolution of poverty in Maldives.

Poverty measurement framework
The most widespread poverty indicator is the share of individuals whose per capita consumption falls below the official
poverty line. This indicator is usually defined in the literature as headcount index and it is a measure of the incidence of
poverty. Antecedent to computing the headcount index are two steps: defining a welfare aggregate, e.g. the dimension with
respect to which we define the minimally acceptable standard of living; and establishing a minimum acceptable standard of
that indicator to separate the poor from the non-poor (the poverty line).
Maldives lacks an official and unique national poverty line. Since the first household survey in 1997/98, poverty measurement
has relied on the use of several relative poverty lines, defined in terms of median or a fraction of median consumption of the
population living in the atolls, excluding the capital Malé. No efforts had so far been made to assess which of these poverty
lines actually corresponds to a reasonable minimum threshold by the standards of living prevailing in Maldives.
The consumption aggregate is the sum of the consumption expenditures of all food and non-food items of each household.
Due to data limitations, the consumption aggregate does not include spending in durables and the flow of services from
the primary dwelling (usually intended as rent for tenants, and imputed rent for home owners). The validity of official
poverty profiles is severely hindered by the lack of any adjustment of the consumption aggregate for spatial differences
in living costs. The lack of spatial price adjustment represents a fundamental flaw of the current poverty measurement
methodology, especially given the unequal distribution of economic opportunities throughout the Maldivian archipelago,
relevance of transport costs and differential access to goods and services between the capital area Malé and other atolls.

Poverty methodology adopted for the SCD
In order to improve the comparability of the two HIES surveys, and to overcome the shortfalls of the official poverty
methodology, a new consumption aggregate and a new poverty line have been estimated.
The new consumption aggregate is defined as the sum of all food and non-food household expenditures, excluding housing,
lumpy expenditures (purchase of vehicles, major tools and equipment, household appliances, durables, furniture), and rare
expenditures (jewelry, hay, wedding and parties). The consumption aggregate so defined is then divided by the household
size, defined as the sum of family members and paying guests. To take into account the spatial price differences, the
consumption aggregate is deflated using regional food poverty lines.

118

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

Using the Cost of Basic Needs approach and HIES 2009-10 data, the national poverty line has been estimated at MVR
787.5. This value is equivalent to the minimum necessary to consume 1,826 Kilocalories per capita per day plus a nonfood allowance equal to the average non-food expenditure of households with food expenditure just enough to reach the
minimum caloric requirement.
The World Bank uses as extreme poverty line $1.25 a day in 2005 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the poverty
lines found in the poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption among 88 surveyed countries over the period
1990-2005 (Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula, 2009). Maldives’ national poverty line is about $1.90 a day in 2005 PPP. Other
commonly used poverty lines for international comparisons across middle-income countries are $2 and $2.50 a day in 2005
PPP, which correspond, in turn, to MVR 821.3 and MVR 1,034.2 a month in 2010 prices. In addition to the national poverty
line, the SCD use the international poverty lines for cross-country comparisons.

The depth and severity of poverty
Although the headcount index is the most widespread measure of poverty, it has a serious shortcoming in that it does not
take into account the intensity of poverty, i.e. how far from the poverty line the poor are. A measure of poverty that overcomes
this problem is the poverty gap index. The poverty gap index is the average shortfall of the total population from the poverty
line as a share measured as a percentage of the poverty line itself, and it defines the depth of poverty. The squared poverty
gap gives a higher weight on households furthest away from the poverty line and it is a measure of the severity of poverty.
Both of these measures will complement the analysis of headcount poverty in the context of the SCD.

Shared prosperity
The World Bank has adopted two new targets to make explicit its goal of “A world free of poverty.” The two targets are:
ending extreme poverty by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity. Sustainability is an overarching priority in the pursuit of
these goals: achieving them requires promoting environmental, social, and fiscal sustainability. The emphasis on reducing
extreme poverty is in line with the commitment to halve extreme poverty enshrined in the first target of the Millennium
Development Goals, which were adopted globally in 2000. Shared prosperity focuses explicitly on the less well off more
broadly. Promoting shared prosperity is defined as maximizing income (or consumption) growth for the bottom 40 percent
of the population. In Maldives, the consumption cut-off line for the bottom 40 percent (the threshold below which the
poorest 40 percent of population falls) in 2010 is 1,266 MVR a month, or $3.06 a day in 2005 PPP.

Annex 2. Summary of SCD consultations
SUMMARY OF SCD CONSULTATIONS IN MALDIVES
APRIL 27 – 30, 2015

OVERVIEW
A series of seven consultations involving nearly 100 participants was carried out as part of the preparation of this Systematic
Country Diagnostic in Malé. Participants were drawn from government agencies, civil society organizations, youth groups,
non-governmental organizations, student bodies, academia, development partner, and the private sector to ensure that
diverse perspectives were represented.
The consultations were arranged under four thematic groups: (1) Opportunities for private-sector development and economic
diversification; (2) Improving government delivery performance; (3) Addressing social risks; and (4) Tackling environmental
vulnerability. In all sessions, the WBG highlighted the key messages that were emerging in the preparation of the Systematic
County Diagnostic for Maldives and presented a broad overview of issues that were considered important to be addressed.
The consultation process also included two technical meetings in Malé with representatives of the Government of Maldives.
These meetings were used as a means of further understanding the current government strategy and as an opportunity to
engage with the government team that was preparing the National Development Strategy.
Three objectives guided the consultation process:
∫

Obtaining perspectives from stakeholders on key economic, social and environmental challenges facing Maldives.

∫

Presenting an overview of the key findings of the SCD and validating the data used.

∫

Sharpening key messages in the SCD and identifying any new trends that were emerging .

Participants broadly agreed with the key areas identified as priorities facing Maldives and the main thrust of the SCD in
this context. Tourism and fisheries remain the two main engines of growth. Participants agreed that while tourism has
remained largely an enclave industry, fisheries has unrealized potential. Key vulnerabilities were also highlighted. They
included: (1) a weak macro fiscal environment (largely linked to unsustainable cost of service provision to a small and
dispersed population, coupled with inefficiencies in government expenditures); (2) social trends, (youth unemployment
especially among women); (3) environmental vulnerabilities, (related to the lack of institutional capacity to adequately
manage natural resources, deficiencies in waste, sewerage and management leading to pollution, and lower prioritization
of environmental issues in government policies); and (4) governance issues. The following report presents recurring points
noted during consultations.

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

1.	Opportunities for private-sector development and economic diversification
Agriculture
Increasing linkages between agriculture SMEs and high-value sectors such as tourism were described as important
income-generating activities for island communities. Agriculture was identified as a sector that could have significant
impact on promoting shared prosperity. Participants explained that although demand for locally sourced produce exists
in the tourism industry (as its cheaper and involves less wastage), the lack of a single aggregated market and high
transportation costs make imports more feasible for resorts. On the supply side, the lack of extension services and
limited willingness of Maldivians famers to cooperate on decisions related to the type of produce to grow on the limited
land were also cited as key obstacles for the growth of agricultural SMEs.
The establishment of cooperative societies on islands have seen mixed results. Participants highlighted several
instances where the establishment of cooperatives has led to significant income generation for farmers with valueadded agricultural produce being sold resorts. However, there have also been several instances where cooperatives
failed due to the inability of farmers to reach consensus on the type of crops to be grown and the manner in which scarce
resources (water and land) were to be utilized. Some participants expressed concern that the lessons learned from
previous failed attempts were not being analyzed and used in the implementation of new schemes. Participants further
explained that the lack of quality extension services and access to finance were further obstacles to the development
of agriculture in Maldives.
Fisheries
While investment in the fisheries sector is lucrative, low budget allocations, low reliance on technology and the lack of
data sharing has impeded growth in this subsector. Participants highlighted the fact that the fisheries sector has been
a source of steady income (with earnings in excess of $1,000/month per fisherman). However, declining revenues in
the last five years was cited as a cause for concern. Participants pointed out that increased national budget allocations
for the development of the sector would promote opportunities for substantially scaling up the fisheries industry. Low
cooperation among fishermen to identify prime fishing sites, limited knowledge of and low use of technology, and
unreliable data (specifically on harvesting trends) were identified as other issues impeding growth in the sector. The
creation of better linkages with resorts was also cited as a possible step towards increasing revenues and expanding
the fisheries industry. Labor regulations that prevented the use of migrant workers for harvesting of fish was cited as a
possible factor in allowing all income generated by the industry to benefit Maldivians directly.

121

Access to finance
A conservative lending culture is impeding SME growth. Participants explained that access to finance was severely
constrained for SMEs. Most SMEs (especially new ventures) do not have sufficient collateral to obtain loans and the lack
of tailored financial products and instruments impede capital requirements for their expansion.. Loans for agriculture, in
comparison, were cited as more easily obtained. However, as sufficient monitoring and evaluation was not being carried
out in the sector, some loans were being used for private consumption and not for agricultural expansion. Participants
also explained that conducting a needs assessment to identify the specific financial instruments required for SME
development is an important first step to increase access to finance and also reduce the cost of finance.

2.	Improving government delivery performance
Issues concerning weak governance and the lack of strong public institutions were cited as key concerns for Maldivians
at present. While participants were satisfied with overall government service provision, improving both the standard
of education (from early childhood education to tertiary and vocational education) and health facilities was cited as
important. Participants explained that the absence of sufficient checks and balances between the key arms of state, the
perceived limited independence of the Judiciary, and low levels of transparency and accountability in the administration
resulted in a weak institutional framework. This undermined public trust in the institutional framework and also led to
the erosion of investor confidence. Participants cited examples such as bringing the Environment Protection Agency
under the purview of the Ministry of Tourism (thus limiting the autonomy of the agency), the reversal of policies, and
the lack of transparency in the granting of students loans and SME development loans as key instances where the
governance mechanism had failed. Participants also described political instability as a major impediment in tackling
key issues involving solid and liquid waste management, urban development and climate change resilience. Additionally
participants indicated that the absence of a transparent, open and safe space for dialogue between public- and
private-sector stakeholders and the lack of a participatory approach to policy making as key obstacles to improving the
governance framework within Maldives.

3.	Addressing social risks
Youth unemployment
Resolving issues related to youth, such as unemployment and skills development, was consistently cited as a key priority
by participants at all four sessions. Employers and employees provided contradictory viewpoints as to why unemployment
continued to a significant issue. Youth unemployment was attributed several factors by employers. Perceptions of poor
work ethic among Maldivian youth, the inability to obtain the required skill sets (instances of difficulties in finding
Maldivians with an adequate command of English were highlighted) and practical difficulties (such as the provision of
transport to island communities to work in resorts) were key reasons cited by employers. Employees highlighted the bias
against the hiring of Maldivians by Maldivians (specifically in the tourism sector for positions beyond a supervisor role and
in the health sector for nurses), the lack of vocational training opportunities for employment as electricians, plumbers
and carpenters (where significant labor demand exists), and the lax implementation of labor regulations (specifying

122

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

that half of employees should be Maldivians) in the tourism sector. Beyond skills, the consultations highlighted that
youth unemployment stems from a disconnect between the aspirations of an ‘ideal’ job among the current generation
of youth and their parents on the one hand, and the reality of the kinds of jobs that are available in a small island
country with limited human capacity. Youth unemployment was cited as the key reason for increased drug abuse and
the participation of young people in gangs. Current policy initiatives were also cited as being insufficient to address key
youth issues and required the adoption of a holistic and contextual approach for increased success.
Intergenerational relations were highlighted as another driver exacerbating youth unemployment. Social norms that
favor young people continuing to live at home relieve the young of the financial and social pressures to search for jobs.
Even as affordable housing remains elusive and the size of homes shrinks, multigenerational homes continue to be the
norm, and continue to provide a financial buffer for unemployed youth. The lack of space and house overcrowding had
also encouraged many young people to look for a space outside the home in search of an identity. This helped lead to
the proliferation of gangs and drug use.
Gender roles
While the civil law structure in Maldives promotes gender egalitarianism, the consultations revealed that gender norms
in Maldives are strongly influenced by social dynamics. Participants explained that in the recent years Maldivian society
has been shifting towards a form of conservatism that has strengthened taboos and social stigmas. This was described
as having a negative impact on women’s choices to enroll in education and search for jobs. Participants highlighted the
need for focused policy initiatives to combat the decrease in the number of women seeking employment and disengaging
from playing an active role in Maldivian society.

4.	Tackling environmental vulnerability
Efficient usage of land requires the analysis of the efficiency of allocation together with strengthened monitoring and
evaluation frameworks within institutions. Participants explained that key decisions such as the allocation of islands
for tourism should be juxtaposed in the context of using such land for the expansion of agriculture. With the inability
to analyze the extent to which agricultural livelihoods have been lost due to the construction of resorts (especially for
resorts where construction was not totally completed) owing to the lack of data, due consideration must be given to
determining what effect future allocations will have in this regard. Although monitoring and evaluation is carried out on
islands that have been leased out for agriculture, further cost benefit analysis will ensure allocative efficiencies.
Strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks are required to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources. Participants
explained that while tuna fishery is heavily regulated (in line with obligations to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission) and
fishing for sharks is banned to prevent over-exploitation, no such protection exists for reef fish. Participants said that
reef fish such as groupers were possibly over-fished on some reefs, thereby damaging ecosystems. Resource-sharing
and linked management between the fisheries and tourism sectors (specifically in the sustainable management of the
reef fish population) were also highlighted as being vital.

123

5.	Recommendations
Future government strategies must incorporate integrated planning encompassing all sectors. Participants identified
the lack of integrated planning (combining different sectors) as being a key obstacle for the successful implementation
of new initiatives undertaken by the government. Integrated planning was seen as key means of ensuring success in
high-growth sectors, such as tourism, which could benefit from increased linkages with the fisheries sector, (where
the health of coral reefs are directly dependent on sustainable fishing practices). Participants explained that issues
concerning the disposal of waste and sewerage, access to fresh water and the use of renewable energy sources could
have been more easily resolved if integrated urban planning was consistently incorporated into government policy
initiatives.
“The failure to equally address both environmental and fiscal challenges could potentially destroy Maldives in the near
future.”
While public infrastructure investments remain a priority for government, market-based solutions are required to
induce behavior change. Public investments, specifically in port and airport infrastructure, were cited as priority to
combat constraints to international trade. However, increasing social welfare, while ensuring fiscal consolidation, would
require market-based solutions.
Improving statistics
Improving the reliability and consistency of key statistical data was seen as vital for the development of effective policy
measures. Participants highlighted that critical discrepancies in statistics considerably distorted the policy planning
process. Vital statistical data, such as income and employment generation in the fisheries and agriculture sectors,
was described as severely under represented. Data was also described as sparse for various aspects of consumption,
such as the quantum of public services being consumed by expatriates. Even critical analysis on issues such as youth
unemployment was hindered by the lack of accurate data on the proportion of unemployed youth. Enacting legislation
to ensure quality control of statistics was cited as one measure that could lead to accurate statistical data.
Creation of a consistent consultative process
The consultative process with both the private sector and civil society should be improved to ensure inclusive and
sustainable development. Participants explained that private-sector involvement in policy discussions has been
initiated several times but the outcomes were consistently undermined by political changes that led to the initiation of
unfeasible plans based on election pledges. Participants also highlighted significant gaps between decisions reached
by policymakers and technocrats. This led to government manifestos not being aligned with technical plans, resulting in
changes to existing policy structure when governments changed. The creation of a central focal point for carrying out
consultations and initiating central planning was also cited as key reform measures that would promote transparency
in policy decisions and ensure successful collaboration with the private sector.

124

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic

Box A.1
A snap poll (in the form of a written questionnaire) was also conducted among participants. The questionnaire consisted
of five questions – two on the top three challenges for Maldives (immediately and in the medium-term), one on
possible solutions to these challenges and two on potential steps to be taken immediately and in medium-term on the
government reform agenda. Although the questionnaire drew a 95 percent response rate, the small sample size was
a key drawback for obtaining conclusive results on the overall trend of responses. The exercise provided the means
for obtaining information on issues that participants were reluctant to discuss (such as corruption). It also provided
further assessment of the key thematic areas, verification of response patterns, and enabled the further prioritization
of proposed reform actions to be initiated.

Even though there is basic infrastructure in place for capital
markets, their volume of operations remain very limited.
The lack of a liquid capital market may reduce the local financing for
larger investments. However the lack of a critical mass of potentially
qualifying issuers and institutional investors pose major challenges
on the potential viability of capital markets in Maldives. Political
risk considerations may undermine the ability of capital markets to
attract foreign investors.

Operations of MFLC, the largest leasing company in Maldives reduced sharply following the negative ruling on their ability to enforce claims on leased assets.
It is estimated that following the ruling the company’s leasing portfolio decreased by 21 percent, its borrowing by 38 percent, and its net worth by 18 percent.
Management is using its cash to pay off debt and declare dividends rather than for funding new leases. Its management is now limiting new leasing primarily
to repeat customers with whom it has been able to sign standard contractual end of term asset transfer options that will reduce risks of loss on the lease
contracts.
