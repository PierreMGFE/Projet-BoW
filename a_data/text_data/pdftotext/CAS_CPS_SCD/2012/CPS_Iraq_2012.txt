EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.
Iraq is at a crossroads. While past years saw a country in transition, with sectarian violence
particularly from 2005-2008, and strong presence of foreign intervention, the situation in Iraq is
changing, and Iraqi-led political processes are maturing. The last United States (US) troops withdrew
in December 2011, marking the end of eight years of the US-led military presence in Iraq. The
international donor community, which has been heavily involved in Iraq over the past years, is
incrementally withdrawing or shifting from grant-based reconstruction efforts to loans and
partnerships. Two elections have been held since 2003, providing for further maturity in national
political processes. The latest elections were held in 2010, resulting in a delicately balanced
governing coalition. The Government has been organizing itself to develop and agree on complex
national compacts at a country and sectoral level: on sharing the country’s national resources through
the proposed hydrocarbons law; and designing and implementing strategies in key areas such as
energy, education, and pensions. Iraq has returned as an active member of the international
community, forging long-term engagements with international organizations and re-connecting with
the region at large, reflected, for example, by hosting the 2012 Arab Summit.
ii.
On the economic front, Iraq is a richly resource-endowed country; however this presents
its own challenges. Oil production is projected to continue increasing to reach about six million
barrels per day by end of this decade. However, oil dependence makes the country highly susceptible
to oil price fluctuations, and the hydrocarbons sector does not provide enough jobs for Iraq’s large
population. In addition, given institutional capacity limitations, Iraq faces great difficulties in
effectively using the vast revenues generated by oil and in effectively delivering services to the
population. While Iraq has achieved growth and reduced inflation in recent years, issues remain with
medium-term budget planning and expenditure, corruption, inequality, political disruption, and other
vulnerabilities which hold back its progress. Iraq is also attempting to recover from the setbacks of
years of conflict and civil strife. Progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
is slow, and there have been reversals on some indicators. The development challenge for Iraq is to
build up its capacity to properly use its own substantial resources for the benefit of current and future
generations and to diversify its economy away from over-reliance on oil. The challenge is also to
move from a country-centric development agenda to a more open and competitive stance, including
regional and broad international integration through trade, commerce and new technologies.
iii.
In 2010, the Government prepared the National Development Plan (NDP) 2010-2014, a
medium-term development strategy aimed at providing a framework for the country's
sustainable development. This strategy is complemented by a Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)
done in January 2009, developed with World Bank support. The NDP's economic pillar aims to
achieve Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 9.4 percent per annum; to generate 3 to 4.5 million
new jobs; to diversify the economy away from oil and into agriculture, industrial sectors, and tourism;
and to create a stronger role for the private sector, both in terms of investment and job opportunities.
The strategy aims to reduce poverty rates by 30 percent from 2007 levels by focusing on
comprehensive rural development and providing basic services such as education and healthcare,
particularly for vulnerable groups such as youth and women. The NDP focuses on environmentallysensitive economic and social development using available natural resources in a sustainable way. It
also aims to strengthen the role of local governments to bring service delivery and economic
development closer to the people. The NDP is in the process of being updated to cover the period
2013-2017.

i

iv.
This first World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Iraq aims to
support Government efforts to implement the NDP, building on stakeholder feedback and
lessons learned. It also reflects the Bank and IFC’s regional framework and strategy for the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) Region which has evolved to respond to the events of the Arab Spring
and focuses on governance, sustainable private sector-led growth, job creation and economic and
social inclusion. This CPS marks a turning point in the Bank’s engagement with Iraq. Following
three interim strategy notes, this CPS moves away from transition to embrace a deeper and longer-term
engagement with a view to informing important policy choices that will lay the foundation for Iraq’s
future. The CPS is built on a thorough dialogue with the Government and stakeholders, including
civil society, academia and the private sector. The Bank’s previous strategies focused on supporting
Iraq’s reconstruction efforts, building capacity of state institutions and laying the foundation for
long-term growth. The Bank’s program included significant analytical work, technical assistance and
training, and investments across a range of sectors including infrastructure, health, education and
social protection, as well as a Development Policy Loan supporting budget management, the financial
sector and the social protection system. Project support was financed through about US$500 million
from the multi-donor Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) and a one-time allocation of US$500 million from the
International Development Association (IDA). The lessons learned from the Bank Group’s
engagement over the past several years will inform this CPS, in particular the need to adapt to realities
on the ground and the need for strong Government ownership.
v.
The Bank Group is shifting to a new modality of engagement with Iraq. The Bank’s
nearly US$1 billion reconstruction and recovery portfolio will come to an end during the CPS period.
The Bank Group’s new program will seek to help Iraq leverage its own vast public resources and build
effective public and private institutions needed to create jobs and deliver services. The Bank will also
start helping Iraq leverage its strategic regional positioning and human capital potential to build the
tenets of its participation in and integration into its immediate region and beyond. This will require
the Bank Group to bring knowledge and best practices to help find practical solutions and to move
from a transaction-based engagement to strategic support for institutional development. Catalytic
investments financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD),
analytical and advisory activities (AAA), International Finance Corporation (IFC) advisory and
investment engagement, guarantees from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and
reimbursable services will form the backbone of this CPS.
vi.
To support the country’s efforts to build stronger government institutions and a more
diversified economy that can deliver services to the population and create jobs, the CPS is
structured to pivot around three axes: (i) Improving Governance; (ii) Supporting Economic
Diversification for Broadly-Shared Prosperity; and (iii) Improving Social Inclusion and Reducing
Poverty. The key focus areas which shaped existing programs (i.e. public financial management,
strengthening institutions, private sector development, infrastructure, and service delivery) remain
relevant in this context. Gender is an important cross-cutting theme. On governance, the Bank Group
will seek to understand sector-wide governance challenges, and support improved fiscal management,
public procurement, government auditing, and civil service performance; expanded demand-side
accountability, particularly for beneficiaries of public services; setting and enforcing high standards
for managing Bank resources; and building coalitions for addressing governance and anti-corruption
challenges at the country level. Unleashing Iraq’s growth potential in the non-oil sector will involve
efforts to improve the business environment; expand core infrastructure, especially in roads (with a
view to deepening regional integration and increasing market size), water and electricity; enhance
agricultural productivity, with a focus on food security; and strengthen public sector management and
sub-national governance. In addition, the Bank Group will seek to help the Government improve the
management of water resources and to address climate-change given Iraq’s high vulnerability.

ii

Reducing inequality and social exclusion will involve increasing the access of the poor—and in
particular women—to basic education, health services and water and sanitation, and improving social
safety nets.
vii.
A proposed program is outlined in the CPS to support this agenda. Analytical and
advisory activities include, inter alia, follow-up work to a Public Expenditure Review and a Report on
Oil Revenue Management for Economic Diversification, a Poverty and Gender Assessment,
Agriculture Technical Assistance, a Gas Master System Study, and Financial Sector Dialogue. IBRD
projects amounting to US$540 million have been identified starting in FY14 for five operations
including Integrated Financial Management Information Systems; Governance; Trade and Transport
Corridors; Irrigation and Water Resources and Water Supply and Sewerage. In addition, a program of
Reimbursable Services is being developed.
viii.
Implementing the Program. Iraq’s realities call for a CPS that is flexible in design and
implementation arrangements and adaptable to evolving circumstances. The Bank will adjust its
program depending on opportunities and progress in the results areas. The indicative lending
envelope is US$600-900 million during the CPS period. IFC will continue investing in the private
sector with an indicative program of US$100-150 million per year (assuming continued improvement
in the business environment), and will ramp up its advisory services in the country. MIGA will
continue to support Iraq’s efforts to attract foreign private investors through the provision of political
risk guarantees. The Bank Group will continue to work closely with other development partners in
the context of the International Partners’ Forum, as well as with civil society, the media and other
stakeholders. Strategic communications will seek to provide information to stakeholders and to
provoke constructive and informed debate.
ix.
Managing Risks. There are several risks to the Bank Group’s program in Iraq, including a
politically fluid situation, vested interests, regional instability, in-country violence and insecurity as
well as economic volatility related to the fluctuation of oil prices. This CPS aims to be candid about
identified risks and their impact - direct or indirect - on its implementation. The most important risk
pertains to the political and security situations which remain fragile. Gaps in capacity or commitment
of the Government to implement reform or reversal of policies, particularly near the next elections,
may also undermine the success of the Bank’s program. Other risks include vulnerability to external
shocks and terrorism. Project implementation risks include weaknesses in project and contract
management, fiduciary and safeguards management. The Bank Group intends to be realistic in what
it can accomplish and to adapt the program as needed. The Bank will continue to make policy
recommendations and support prudent macroeconomic management by the Government, which is the
key to providing the fiscal space for the Government to adjust appropriately to fiscal shocks when they
occur and will continue to find ways to carry out supervision of the ongoing portfolio despite a difficult
security environment. In the event that the operating environment deteriorates in Iraq, IFC will focus
on portfolio management and engaging selectively through its advisory arm.

II.

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

Political and Security Developments
1.
After years of uncertainty, conflict and instability, the Iraqi state, while still fragile, has
been consolidating. Following a gradual slow-down of violence and insecurity during the period
2006-08, parliamentary elections in 2010 resulted in a coalition government presided over by Nouri
Al-Maliki of the Al-Dawa party (Shi’a) and including Ministers from the Al-Iraqiya (secular), the
Saadrist (Shi’a), and the Kurdish blocs. However, sectarian and political divisions continue. More
recently, tensions between the Al-Dawa party and Al-Iraqiya have threatened the stability of the
governing coalition. Attempts to bring all parties to the table through a national conference have failed
to materialize thus far, creating an atmosphere of political instability. In recent weeks there has been a
lowering of tensions between the Kurds and the central authorities over the exploration of oil. This will
hopefully open the way for negotiations to resume over a national oil law. At the same time, legislative
processes in Iraq are maturing, and the delicately-balanced governing coalition has been organizing itself
to develop and agree on country and sector level strategies.
2.
Security has improved overall, but the situation is volatile. Iraq has made significant
progress in improving security with violent incidents declining from a high of 2,700 per month in 2008 to
263 as of March 2012 (Figure 1). The US fully withdrew its troops in December 2011, and although the
security situation is now greatly improved since the mid-2000s, incidents continue sporadically,
especially around religious or political events with some large-scale attacks against security and civilian
targets. Ramadan 2012 saw a spike in violence with over 400 Iraqis reported killed. The political
situation remains volatile and unpredictable, affecting the Government’s ability to manage security and
focus on development issues. At the same time, Iraq remains vulnerable to regional instability. The
Syrian crisis, which is spilling over to Iraq as other neighboring countries, is adding to an already difficult
situation.
3.
Centralization of power and corruption threaten the legitimacy of the state. Iraq’s
constitution calls for a federal state, but power is concentrated in Baghdad with oil wealth concentrated
primarily in areas such as the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Kirkuk, and Basra. Only KRG
enjoys increased autonomy, prompting other regions, such as the Sunni Diyala and Salahaddin Provinces
to also demand some level of autonomy and self-governing as stipulated by the Constitution. The
breakdown of society during the Iraq war along sectarian and ethnic lines has further weakened Iraq’s
unity. Governance challenges also threaten the legitimacy of the state. The three pillars of state
oversight mandated by the constitution, the Commission of Integrity, the Board of Supreme Audit and the
Council of Representatives, are hampered in delivering on their mandates and the judicial system is not
yet able to prosecute corruption cases.

Differences over distribution of power and coalition partners have dominated Iraqi politics,
distracting attention from the immediate task of rebuilding the country and laying the ground for
economic development. If these differences continue, political tensions are likely to rise until the next
election, worsening economic management, delaying governance improvements impeding the delivery of
services to the population, and potentially aggravating the fragile security situation.
Social and Poverty Trends
5.
Despite its vast oil wealth, Iraq’s standard of living has declined over the past 25 years.
Gross domestic product (GDP) per person declined by a third between 1980 and 2006, from about
US$3,000 to about US$2,000 as a result of conflict and war. Social trends have paralleled economic
trends: for example, primary school enrollment, an area where Iraq traditionally led in the region, has
declined over the past 25 years.
6.
Poverty is widespread but shallow, particularly affecting vulnerable groups such as widows
and the displaced. The 2010 Poverty Assessment showed that overall poverty is 23 percent. About 6.9
million Iraqis are classified as poor, half in rural areas and half in urban areas. Iraq’s poverty gap index
(i.e. average distance from the poverty line) of 4.5 percent is also extremely low compared to most other
countries. Iraq’s comparative absence of absolute poverty is largely a result of the impact of universal
food rations under the Public Distribution System (PDS), but this does not capture the deterioration of
livelihoods for ordinary Iraqis. The poor lack access to employment –– two-thirds work in the informal
sector, most in non-wage agriculture (27 percent) or as employees in small unregulated enterprises (24
percent). The poor also suffer from shortages of housing and basic services – 89 percent live in crowded
housing with very poor electricity service. Schools are in poor condition with low enrollment rates,
especially for poor girls. 2 The country’s current national poverty target is to reduce poverty from 23
percent (2007) to 16 percent (2015). The poverty line will be revalidated by the 2012 household survey
currently underway, which may affect the target.
7.
Rapid population growth, urbanization and demographic transition will shape Iraq’s
development prospects for the next decades. Years of war and sectarian strife have led to a rural to
urban shift in Iraq as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) increasingly opt to stay in areas where they feel
more secure. This has led to a growing expansion of the urban population which cities like Baghdad are
ill-equipped to accommodate. The pressure on housing and basic services, including water and
sanitation, is a growing social problem. The urban transport, water and sanitation infrastructure for
Baghdad was planned for 600,000 inhabitants, but today Baghdad hosts a population of about five to six
million.
8.
Iraq has a very low employment rate (only 38 percent of adult Iraqis are employed), and
women face particular challenges in terms of economic opportunities. The public sector employs 32
percent of all working Iraqi adults, and the job-creating capacity of the hydrocarbons sector is very
limited. The female labor force participation rate is only about eleven percent. Female unemployment
is at 20 percent versus male unemployment at 14 percent (2008). According to the 2007 Household
Socio-Economic Survey (which formed the basis of the poverty assessment in the Poverty Reduction
Strategy), the relatively few women who participate in the labor force are heavily concentrated either in
public sector wage jobs, notably education (non-poor, educated, primarily urban women) or at the
opposite end of the spectrum in non-wage agricultural jobs (poor, less-educated, mostly rural women).
The situation of widows in Iraq is acute. There are between one to three million estimated 3
female-headed households in Iraq as a result of decades of war and violence. The Iraqi Government has

International Committee for the Red Cross

2

developed a social welfare program intended to help widows financially, but the allowance is deemed
insufficient and many do not receive it.
9.
In keeping with regional trends, youth unemployment is particularly high. Young people,
aged 18–30, are Iraq’s largest demographic group but they have few economic opportunities. Youth
unemployment remains high for both women and men: 30 percent for women and men aged 20-24
(2008), a significant increase from 1990 when youth unemployment was around 7 percent for both young
men and women. Youth, particularly from rural areas, are trapped within communities where the quality
of public education is poor, organized recreational opportunities are non-existent, and the unemployment
rate for 16–25 year-olds exceeds 35 percent. Idleness and a lack of information and effective awareness
campaigns for youth also add to their exclusion from political and economic opportunities.
10.
Returnees and IDPs are a significantly marginalized group. As of September 2011, 1.3
4
million Iraqis were internally displaced. Many IDPs live in deplorable conditions and are deprived of
essential assistance, with their need for humanitarian support increasing the longer their displacement
continues. Within Iraq, there are now an additional 50,000 refugees from Syria with an estimated 500
streaming across the border—largely into northern Iraq—on a weekly basis. 5 Iraqi returnees face many
challenges, including lack of security, livelihood prospects, and social services.
Economic and Governance Context
11.
Amid the challenging political and security environment, Iraq has achieved considerable
progress toward macroeconomic stability since 2003. Due to sound monetary policy and increasing
oil production, Iraq achieved single-digit inflation, economic growth resumed, and the fiscal and current
account balances have strengthened (after deteriorating in the wake of the global financial crisis). Iraq’s
debt-to-GDP ratio has been on a downward trajectory due to debt restructuring with the Paris Club and
rapid GDP growth. The macro stabilization program has been supported by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) through a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), while the World Bank’s Fiscal Sustainability
Development Policy Loan, approved in February 2010, supported structural reforms in budget
management, the social protection system and the financial sector.
12.
Once macroeconomic stabilization was achieved, oil market conditions have become the
dominant determinant of growth. The immediate aftermath of war saw a sharp decline in growth and
a spike in inflation (Figure 2). Inflation was brought down to single digits through an exchange rate peg
and a gradual improvement in the economy’s supply response. Crude oil production and exports have
steadily increased in recent years, with production rising from less than two million barrels per day (mbd)
in 2004 to an estimated 2.7 mbd in 2011; exports were about 2.1 mbd in 2011. At the same time, prices
for Iraqi crude oil, after dipping in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis, increased to US$104 per
barrel in 2011.
13.
Budget surpluses have been underpinned by elevated oil prices, but the budget remains
vulnerable to shocks. While the 2011 surplus was nearly eight percent of GDP, the authorities
exceeded the spending bill target by paying salary increases mandated by Parliament and by spending
more on social services, due primarily to international food price rises which impact the fiscal cost of the
Public Distribution System (PDS) – Iraq’s virtually universal food price subsidy scheme. The IMF SBA
has helped provide support to sound fiscal management. While viewed as precautionary by the
Government, the SBA provides a framework of fiscal discipline for the Bank’s policy dialogue. The
2012 budget adopted by Parliament is broadly in line with IMF recommendations, and fiscal policy has
4

UNHCR, October 25, 2012

3

remained on track. Increasing off-budget domestic debt in 2010-2012 presents a potential vulnerability.
14.
The heavy dependence on oil has two key implications for fiscal policy and institutions.
First, it subjects revenue and therefore expenditure to volatility of international oil prices. Second,
dependence on oil receipts (and negligible contribution of tax revenues) to fund the budget means that the
authorities face little incentive to build strong budgetary institutions and transparency, due in part to
limited demand for accountability to the population. Medium-term fiscal planning is rudimentary and
lacks credibility with the public. Fiscal forecasting is made primarily on the basis of projected oil export
volumes and prices rather than robust macroeconomic and fiscal analysis.
15.
The overhang of Saddam-era debts has been reduced but not eliminated. In November
2004, the Paris Club countries agreed to reduce the country’s Paris Club debts by 80 percent in three
phases provided Iraq met a specific set of conditions. Some Paris Club creditors also agreed to additional
bilateral relief efforts beyond the 80 percent reduction. Iraq was able to abide by all of the Paris Club
conditions, and in 2009, the successful conclusion of the IMF 2007-2009 SBA triggered the release of the
final tranche of debt relief agreed by the Paris Club. A number of Iraq’s non-Paris Club creditors have
also agreed to debt relief comparable to the Paris Club treatment. Iraq’s commercial debt was also
successfully restructured with terms comparable to the ones offered by Paris Club creditors. Overall, the
external debt to GDP ratio fell from 220 percent in 2006 to 107 percent of GDP in 2010 6. However, even
with these significant relief efforts by a number of Iraq’s creditors, further negotiations are needed to
determine how substantial non-Paris Club debts (notably to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries) will be settled.
Iraq’s Medium-Term Prospects
16.
Iraq’s oil production and export revenues are projected to increase well into the medium
term. Real GDP growth is projected to increase by ten percent in 2012 and 14.7 percent in 2013, even if
the pace of global growth is low. Growth will be driven by expansion of crude oil production and exports
and associated investment needs. However, non-oil sector growth is only about five percent per year, far
below what would be expected for a reconstructing country. In 2011, oil sector revenues accounted for
70 percent of GDP, 91 percent of total revenues, and 99 percent of export revenues. This strong
dependence of the economy on the oil sector is projected to persist. The lack of diversification also
undermines Iraq’s ability to conduct medium-term fiscal policy since there is no non-oil tax base
providing more predictable revenue flows.
17.
The recurrent budget is dominated by a few major items related to security and basic
services, while the capital budget suffers from chronic under-execution. For the recurrent budget,
nearly 40 percent of employee compensation is on security and defense. Fuel subsidies, pensions, and
the food distribution system account for much of recurrent non-wage spending; these policy instruments
constitute an imperfect social safety net with significant inefficiencies. For the capital budget, the
average execution rate is about 60 percent, and the failure to deliver key projects on time contributes to
frustrations of the public and investors with the Government.
18.
Improvements in fiscal stability and transparency have not been followed by the building of
sound fiscal institutions. Besides the notable reduction in budget deficits in recent years (down from 22
percent of GDP in 2009), revenue transparency has improved. In this regard, the roles played by the
Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) – now fully under Iraqi management – as well as the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) are important. However, the current fiscal policy framework
falls short of the level needed, given Iraq’s circumstances. This pertains in particular to: (i) reducing the
6

costs of oil revenue volatility by de-linking government spending from short-term fluctuations in oil
export proceeds; (ii) safeguarding the quality of public spending through strengthened public expenditure
management systems; and (iii) ensuring longer-term fiscal sustainability through provision for incomegenerating assets, whether real or financial.
Figure 2: Selected Economic Indicators

19.
Because of its large youth bulge and the need to provide employment for these young labor
force entrants, Iraq cannot rely only on its oil wealth. Economic diversification will be essential for
job creation. Because the energy sector is capital intensive, it is generating jobs in the magnitude of tens
of thousands, whereas the country’s job creation needs run into the millions. Numerous analyses of
private investment point to the need for regulatory reforms which will allow for increasing private sector
involvement in sectors outside the oil industry, providing the vehicle for diversification and jobs.
Agriculture and religious tourism are identified as potential sources of diversification. Neither sector
could be a major national employment driver on its own, but they have tremendous growth potential and
strong linkages with the service sector, where the bulk of the jobs lie for the Iraqis. On tourism, millions
of attendees at the major pilgrimage sites in Karbala and Najaf are reported, and those arriving by land are
not fully captured in the official statistics. Thus the total number of visitors is already in the millions,
even with the current security situation.
20.
Productivity-led growth would require a more skilled labor force. Although the country has
a legacy as a center of education and culture, there is a significant problem of illiteracy especially among
women. Iraq will have difficulty achieving momentum in productivity growth without quality education

5

and expansion in market size and for this, better global and regional integration is essential. The private
sector needs to be seen as an integral player in Iraq's development. Investment opportunities are already
present in the construction, banking, industry, agriculture, agribusiness and tourism sectors, and the
private sector has the knowledge and incentives to take advantage of them if the right enablers are present.
These opportunities will, if realized, provide substantial sources of job creation and diversified growth.
Table 1: Iraq Medium-Term Outlook

21.
Iraq’s difficult political legacy is likely to exacerbate the usual resource curse problems
associated with oil and gas abundance. Since oil revenues are seen as collective property, in the

6

absence of well-defined distribution mechanisms, there will be a tendency for everyone to race to get
“their share.” This process could easily degenerate into perceptions of unfairness aggravating existing
tensions. Furthermore, despite all the emphasis on investment in recent budgets, Iraq faces the prospect
of preference for investments that can be made regionally specific or in some sense associated, if not
appropriated, by local interests. Conversely, the federal layer, especially non-security, could get
squeezed. The political economy of the country points to the need for a distribution policy that favors job
creation for all, equitable access to basic services in all regions, and fair and transparent social safety nets
which target the most needy and vulnerable groups across community and political spectrum.
22.
Under the baseline medium-term outlook, Iraq will have no significant budget or external
financing needs (Table 1). This is because oil revenues will be adequate to ensure that the DFI can fund
the budget, while foreign reserves will easily cover prospective external financing requirements. Gross
foreign reserves are likely to reach US$84 billion in 2015, and DFI balances should also substantially
increase. However, the baseline is subject to wide uncertainty. First, the baseline assumes oil export
prices of around US$100 per barrel, but various factors point to a medium-term weakening of oil market
prospects, including the emergence of shale gas and the impact of Iraq’s own increased crude oil supply
on world prices. Second, fiscal space in the budget is limited, due to the role of politically sensitive items
like salaries and subsidies coupled with pressing demands on the infrastructure side. Further, Iraq’s oil
sector expansion plan involves substantial up-front fiscal commitments. Third, since oil revenues
represent asset depletion, they should be integrated with other financing sources even if, in the aggregate,
all spending needs could be financed from oil. Indeed, a financing mix would allow Iraq to mitigate the
longer-term costs of its rush to increase oil production for cash flow reasons, such as gas flaring, water
re-injection, and damage to oil reservoirs. The Bank has examined a number of scenarios with oil
production, exports, and prices. The scenarios show that there are plausible conditions under which Iraq
could experience fiscal and current account deficits (e.g. at US$80 per barrel) even with oil production of
four mbd. As mentioned, Iraq can likely finance deficits from accumulated revenues, but the scenarios
help to indicate the speed with which these fiscal buffers could be depleted under adverse external
conditions. As inputs for a more stable fiscal situation, Iraq will need to adopt a fiscal policy that: (1)
aligns with its implementation capacity; (2) respects the fundamental balancing of macro aggregates; (3)
develops the extensive gas resources along with recovering flared gas; and (4) diversifies its economy.
Key Development Challenges
Governance
23.
Iraq fares low in global governance benchmarking. Transparency International ranks Iraq at
175 out of 182 countries on its 2011 corruption index, a slight improvement over previous rankings. This
ranking places Iraq just above countries like Somalia, North Korea, Afghanistan and Sudan. Beyond a
history of war and sanctions, endemic corruption is one of the main factors contributing to state weakness.
24.
Institutional capacity and governance weaknesses are at the root of many of Iraq’s
development challenges. Corruption is widespread, transparency and accountability are weak, and the
rule of law is poorly applied. Citizen engagement in oversight is weak. These weaknesses affect the
delivery of public services; access is uneven for individuals and businesses as is the playing field for
private sector provision. Implementation of the rule of law is also poor. Recent integrity indicators
place Iraq among the weakest in a comparison of 50 diverse countries (Figure 3). Yet a number of public
surveys show that the judiciary itself is seen as mostly non-sectarian and minimally corrupt compared to
other public sector institutions.
25.
The quality of public financial management (PFM) transactions and procedures has
improved. Budget credibility (matching of outturns with projections) has shown some quantifiable

7

improvements, and reforms have resulted in the ability to track arrears. Comprehensiveness and
transparency have improved through enhancements to fiscal reporting between national and sub-national
governments. Budget execution systems show mixed results with relative improvements in procurement
transactions offset by deteriorations in payroll controls. Accounting, recording and reporting systems
now have stronger processes for reconciliation of accounts and in-year and annual reporting. External
scrutiny and audit have improved due to more timely external audits.
26.
Notwithstanding the above improvements, certain PFM practices worsened over the past
few years, and procurement is an area of major weakness. Weak PFM practices include off-budget
spending, worsening fiscal reporting, slow progress on Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) implementation, and poor investment budget execution rates. Low budget execution is
largely attributed to poor planning and preparation of instruments and inadequate control over investment
project related cash releases, leading to low level of utilization and large budget surpluses. Public
procurement has also been a significant source of governance concerns and is burdened by outdated and
contradictory rules. Some progress has been made on developing standard bidding documents, a
national implementation manual and a training strategy. A new procurement law based on international
best practices was drafted, but has not been adopted. In addition, occurrences of bribery and collusion
among bidders in public contracting have put an immense strain on public finances. Going forward,
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending would entail continued focus on budget
preparation and implementation, strengthening audit capacity, passing and implementing a new
procurement law, and transparency in reporting public accounting.
Figure 3: Rule of Law Measures (Iraq vs. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Compared)

27.
Building transparency and accountability in Iraq’s public sector will be critical to
improving quality, efficiency and equity in public service delivery and limiting opportunities for
corruption. A number of public episodes of corruption over the past few years illustrate the difficulties
that elite capture presents in Iraq. Iraq also faces risks of money laundering. Ensuring a level playing
field with equal access to public services for all citizens and firms as well as accountability measures such
as freedom of information with a pro-active public disclosure policy would assist in combating these
problems. Strengthening the state-citizen compact and improving government effectiveness will require
developing avenues for the systematic involvement of civil society and private sector groups in the design
and implementation of government programs. This will help to build consensus about important policy
reforms and to focus attention on the issues and concerns raised by citizens.
Private Sector Development and Growth
28.
A vibrant private sector is critical to provide jobs for Iraq’s large population. Decades of
state-driven economic policy have tightly bound Iraq’s economy to the needs of the State. Consequently,
the private sector today has little role or presence, and incentives for its expansion are nearly absent.

8

Because of the State’s long-term dominance, credit systems and access to finance are severely limited.
Iraq’s conflicts have generated problems such as a marked exodus of educated, skilled Iraqis, a sustained
isolation from global networks of information and trade, and significant destruction and degradation of
infrastructure. Job creation remains one of Iraq’s largest development challenges. International
experience suggests that employment generation by a large public sector is unsustainable and that
long-term job growth instead requires the development of an attractive investment climate and a
predictable and low cost of doing business, so that a robust and productive private sector can generate
employment and rising standards of living. Oil accounts for more than half of GDP but for less than one
percent of total employment.
29.
However, the private sector is poorly positioned to play its role as a creator of jobs. In
addition to problems of security, it is plagued by lack of access to credit, high entry and exit barriers and a
slow, ambiguous legal and regulatory system. Like households, businesses suffer from unreliable
delivery of essential services, including telecommunications, transport, sewerage, water, and electricity.
Although the potential for private sector engagement in post-conflict Iraq is significant, the country’s
private sector is both under-developed and fragmented. Most private businesses in Iraq are very small
and mainly operate in retail and trade, construction and transportation services, as well as in light industry
in the textile, food, engineering, and chemical fields. The great majority of businesses are owned by sole
proprietors, with most of the remainder being family partnerships 7. Many of the employees in small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) are unskilled, short-term laborers. Iraq only possesses a handful of large,
typically family-run multi-industry conglomerates, active in retail, domestic trade, telecommunications,
and construction, but not in traded goods and services.
30.
Iraq also suffers from particularly significant gender inequality in labor force
participation, educational attainment and training. This suggests that Iraq can make better use of its
human resources by more fully utilizing the talents and abilities of its female population. Only 13
percent of Iraqi women are in the labor force 8, far lower than virtually all of Iraq’s neighbors. Only
seven percent of sampled firms from an enterprise survey data for the Bank’s Investment Climate
Assessment (ICA) reported that a woman was one of its principal owners, lower than in any MENA
countries to date. Similarly, Iraq has a very low rate of females in management when compared to other
MENA countries. One percent of firms in Iraq have female managers, compared to Syria and Lebanon
with 23 percent and 29 percent females in management, respectively.

31.
World Bank Group analysis has identified numerous constraints on private sector
development, most notably quality of services, the legal framework, and the role of the state. The
World Bank’s 2013 Doing Business Report ranks Iraq 165 out of 185 economies and Iraq ranks second to
last among the 18 economies in the MENA region, significantly behind regional best performers on a
global level such as Saudi Arabia (22), United Arab Emirates (26) and Qatar (40). Even its highest
rankings by sub-component such as "Getting Electricity" (46) "Paying Taxes" (65) and "Dealing with
Construction Permits" (84) are extremely poor, but the most severe constraints are indicated by rankings
for “Resolving Insolvency” (185), “Trading Across Borders” (179) and “Starting a Business” (177).
Constraints to private sector opportunities in the non-oil economy have also been identified through the
ICA. The most critical constraints include lack of electricity supply, political instability and corruption.
The ICA also reports that, in addition to political stability, reform of State-Owned Enterprises and reform
of the poorly-performing banking sector are crucial to the well-being of the private sector.

32.
The Government has placed a high priority on developing the private sector in its National
Development Plan. Draft legislation currently before the Parliament covers labor law, competition
policy and establishing institutions to support private sector development. However, the existing legal
framework suffers from poor enforcement. In addition, there is ineffective coordination between
ministries regulating the private sector, and between the Government and the private sector. Many
ministries have limited capacity to implement reforms and there remains some resistance to cooperating
with the private sector at the operational level. Despite these challenges, there is a significant potential
for private sector-led growth, should the Government implement reforms for an improved business
environment. Two examples of Doing Business areas on which the Government has illustrated
commitment to reform are business registration and construction permits. As the construction sector is
taking off in Iraq, the latter would generate benefits in terms of increasing economic activity and
importantly, jobs.
33.
The Government also recognizes the importance of improving the performance of the
financial sector, including creating a level playing field for non-state banks, improving access to finance
for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and improving financial sector regulation and
governance. Iraq’s financial sector is underdeveloped and dominated by state-owned banks, weak
private bank participation and limited access to finance by firms. The system is not aligned with
international standards and governance structures are weak. In order to improve financial sector
performance it will be important to accelerate the current reform program, including: clarifying the roles
of state-owned banks; restructuring the two largest banks, Al-Rashid and Al-Rafidain; removing barriers

10

for private banks in doing business with the Government and state-owned banks; and adopting concrete
measures to create a level-playing field between private and public banks. A better enabling
environment would facilitate access to finance, including improving credit systems, contract
enforcement, and bankruptcy regulations.
34.
The telecommunications sector has provided some success stories, but its potential remains
under-exploited. The liberalization of mobile telecom attracted several foreign entrants and generates
one of the few significant sources of non-oil fiscal revenue. The fixed line backbone reaches all regions
of the country, but is largely underutilized due to poor service quality and high tariffs. The
telecom/Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) sector provides potential connectivity to
Iraqi citizens, government departments (including provincial governments) and the private sector, using
mobile telephones, Optical Fiber Cable, Microwave, and other fixed lines and wireless technologies.
Combined with high-performing and affordable international telecom connectivity, the sector will
directly contribute to improvements in the business and trade environment of the country. Broadband
internet connectivity and ICT in general are key inputs for transformation across many sectors, and can
help spur job creation, innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly among youth. With the large
connectivity gaps that currently exist, such progress becomes much more arduous.
35.
The agriculture sector, which employs many of the rural poor, is heavily distorted by food
imports and agricultural subsidies and tariffs. Although a potential source of employment,
particularly in rural areas, the sector suffers from low investment, poor productivity, and policy
distortions. Currently around 20 percent of the population is employed in the agricultural sector which is
mostly practiced on small farming units in a low input–low output system. Policies of price and
production controls and marketing restrictions have contributed to the sector’s low productivity and
growth rates. In addition, years of insufficient maintenance and funding have degraded agricultural
services and physical infrastructure, particularly water resources and irrigation infrastructure. On the
policy front, Iraq currently has a top-down, centralized planning approach rather than bottom-up,
decentralized identification of programs and projects that would put farmers and private sector in the
driver’s seat.
Public Service Delivery and Social Protection
36.
In addition to constraining private sector development, poor public service delivery is a
major source of discontent for the Iraqi people. Electricity and water are severely undersupplied,
with total renewable resources dropping rapidly as a result of increased demand (due to population
growth) and declining supplies. Education quality is poor and schools are in need of repair and remain
overcrowded despite operating multiple shifts. Health outcomes are relatively low and the social
protection system is ineffective, especially for the most vulnerable. Iraq’s large oil revenues can be used
to finance the needed investments in public and social services, but capacity and coordination constraints
in Government are hampering these efforts.
37.
Inadequate electricity is seen by Iraqis today as a top concern, impacting daily life. Despite
some recent improvements, power supply continues to fall well below demand, with a national average of
only eight hours per day in 2009. In addition, power shortages are estimated to cost the Iraqi economy
around US$43 billion per year. Chronic power shortages mean that Iraq must rely on expensive
alternative supply sources, costing an estimated US$6-8 billion per year. Iraq’s generation,
transmission, and distribution systems are in significantly degraded condition and new power generation
capacity is urgently needed to meet demand. Rural areas suffer more from electricity shortages than
urban areas because they are less able to purchase generators. Although the Government is undertaking a
major electricity generation investment program that expects to add about 10,000 megawatts (MW) of

11

new generation by 2015, this will increase the focus on weaknesses in Iraq’s transmission and distribution
infrastructure. The challenges for development of Iraq’s energy sector are not only physical in nature;
they are also financial, economic, legal and regulatory, and institutional. Electricity tariffs are currently
low, even by regional standards, and only cover a fraction of production costs which are high due to
excessive losses and expensive imports of fuel and electricity. More than 80 percent of electricity supply
in Iraq is unbilled or uncollected. Low tariffs contribute to significant demand growth, only exacerbating
the pressures on electricity infrastructure. However, it is widely recognized that to raise prices while
supply is chronically unreliable would be socially and politically unacceptable. Increasing the rate of
utilization of the large volumes of gas Iraq produces in association with oil - and stopping the flaring of
gas - could fuel most of the power generation needed in the country for decades, and thereby help with the
current power shortage. Gas can also provide a critical resource to the development of new industries
(petrochemicals and heavy industries). However, Iraqi gas institutions need support to increase their
capacity, set out and implement a strategy, and monitor the huge investments required to treat the gas and
bring it to the plants.
38.
While Iraq once had the most comprehensive transportation system in the region, its
transport infrastructure has suffered from war damage, neglect and underinvestment.
Rehabilitation of transport infrastructure is a national priority. If Iraq is to have the capacity to transport
the high volumes of international freight required to reconstruct infrastructure, buildings, and services,
and diversify from an oil-based economy, most of the existing transport infrastructure needs to be
rehabilitated or reconstructed and expanded. The alleviation of some of the obstacles facing the private
sector, including the deficiencies in infrastructure, will also provide much-needed job opportunities.
39.
Poor water quality and sanitation are also serious concerns. The effectiveness of
Government agencies to meet the day-to-day needs of water for domestic and agricultural use and the
collection and treatment of wastewater has been greatly diminished, leading to serious environmental and
health risks associated with contaminated water supplies and inappropriate handling of wastewater
disposal. This has resulted in a deterioration of the performance of water services in the country, for
example in the Baghdad metropolitan area where 78 percent of the population has problems with its water
supply. In addition, the collection of wastewater is limited: only 35 percent of the urban population has
access to the piped sewerage network. The lack of investment in irrigation water service delivery has
had major impacts on agricultural productivity and rural employment. Iraq is now importing the bulk of
its basic food needs.
40.
The environment in Iraq is degraded, with a high economic cost. The World Bank estimated
that the annual economic cost of environmental degradation in Iraq ranges from four to eight percent of
GDP. Management and investment to address high levels of air and water pollution would improve
performance of all relevant sectors (e.g. sanitation, oil, agriculture, etc.). In addition, Iraq is in the grip of
a water crisis after recent years of severe drought, wiping out crops in some parts of the country and
causing an unusually high number of sandstorms. In the absence of a water sharing agreement with Syria
and Turkey, the level of water in the Tigris and the Euphrates has fallen by more than 60 percent over the
past 20 years and water quality has deteriorated. Municipal and hazardous waste are found in every
urban center and most villages in Iraq with poor or non-existent collection services. Large quantities of
associated natural gas are being flared because gas treatment plants and the pipeline infrastructure to
transport gas for domestic use or export are not functional. Finally, climate change is having a profound
impact on Iraq as it grapples with its water supply and the encroaching desert. To combat these
challenges, Iraq would benefit by adopting and implementing a national climate change mitigation and
adaptation plan, and by taking advantage of international climate change initiatives.
41.

Iraq’s education system is suffering from a history of under-funding, degradation of

12

infrastructure, and depletion of human resources. In 2003, approximately 80 percent of school
buildings were in need of rehabilitation or major repair and twelve universities were seriously damaged.10
Reconstruction of the education system is underway, but major efforts are still needed to address the
massive backlogs in school construction and maintenance, deficient human resource development, poor
management at all levels, outdated curriculum and teaching methods, and poor policy and system
development that accumulated over previous decades. Although teacher numbers are high, there are
issues of utilization, specialization, and deployment, resulting in large class sizes, shortages in specific
subject areas (particularly English, mathematics and sciences), and disparities among geographical areas.
In addition, the quality of pre-service teacher training in colleges and in-service training is considered
inadequate, with poor facilities, lack of sufficient human resources, modern teaching materials and
methods, and limited teaching practice within teacher training courses. Overall, the education system
suffers from poor quality and relevance, and graduates of the system lack the required skills to enter the
labor market. There is a low education level in the adult population. Only eleven percent of Iraqis have
at least a diploma, half the population has primary or intermediate education only, and 38 percent have no
formal education. In addition, there are marked regional and urban/rural differences in literacy rates and
in the quality of education provided as Figure 6 illustrates. These differences foster greater disparities in
economic and social growth across Iraq which, in turn, may well increase regional inequalities and social
fragmentation. The recently completed national education strategy aims to address these deficiencies.
Figure 6: Literacy Rate of Segment of Population Aged 15-24 Years

42.
Women in particular lack equal access to a quality education. There are fewer all-girl
secondary schools (excluding KRG) as compared with all-boy schools (in 2008/09, 31 percent of
secondary schools were for girls only, while 42 percent were for boys only). This is important not only
because it prevents girls from joining the labor market, but also because it prevents the high social returns
on education in terms of improving health indicators, lowering maternal and infant mortality rates, raising
children’s nutritional and school participation rates. Illiteracy among Iraqi women (24 percent) is more
than double that of Iraqi men (11 percent). Literacy tests indicate that illiteracy rates in rural areas are
above 50 percent for women aged 15-24. The national gender target for the 2007 to 2016 period is to
improve the ratio of girls’ to boys’ enrollment from 87 percent to 100 percent, in primary schools, from 72
percent to 86 percent in intermediate schools, and from 69 percent to 85 percent, in secondary schools.
43.
The Iraqi health system has suffered from conflict and neglect. Prior to the 1980s, Iraq’s
health system was considered the most advanced in the region. However, the system has been impacted
by war and conflict resulting in serious weaknesses of the system’s ability to meet basic health needs.
Over the past decade, there have been some signs of improvements in health outcomes, mostly attributed
to improved access and utilization of maternal and child health service. Iraq’s progress to reach the
MDG goal of reducing under-five mortality by two-thirds by 2015 as well as its progress towards
10

Iraq United Nations/World Bank Joint Needs Assessment – Education Sector, October 2003

13

attaining a three-fourth reduction in maternal mortality, another MDG goal, are deemed insufficient at this
juncture, mainly as a result of weak governance and oversight, wide urban/rural disparities in access to
quality care, and a shortage of facilities and qualified health professionals. Iraq spends about 3.3 percent
of GDP on healthcare (US$137 per capita), relatively modest for its level of socioeconomic development.
While about 75 percent of total health spending in Iraq is public, spending is highly skewed towards
pharmaceuticals (37 percent) and administration (22 percent) pointing out the inherent inefficiencies in
health expenditures. Going forward, a look at expenditure flows against services received at the facility
level would be essential to get a complete picture of the sector’s performance and would help the
Government devise appropriate policies to improve the quality of health services and efficiency of the
sector.
44.
Providing adequate social protection remains an important challenge, particularly for the
most vulnerable, such as widows and IDPs. The Government has been introducing structural changes,
while attempting to rationalize subsidies and transition from the universal food subsidy (Public
Distribution System - PDS) to a better-targeted cash transfer program that can meet the needs of the
poorest and most vulnerable. The cash-based Social Safety Net program administered by the Ministry of
Labor and Social Affairs has expanded to cover nearly one million families but targeting remains
inefficient. The pension law of 2007 presented significant improvements, and other major laws are
underway, including the creation of mechanisms to provide portability of benefit entitlements across
private and public pensions schemes so that workers are not penalized when moving from the public to the
private sectors or vice versa.
Government Priorities
45.
In 2009, the Government prepared a medium-term development strategy, the Iraq National
Development Plan (NDP) 2010-2014, which aims to build a market-based economy in Iraq. The
strategy has nine main goals: (i) to achieve economic growth at 9.4 percent per year; (ii) to generate 3 to
4.5 million new jobs; (iii) to diversify the economy away from oil and into agriculture, industrial sectors
(oil and gas, petrochemical industries, chemical fertilizers, cement, pharmaceutical industries), and
tourism (recreational, religious, and cultural); (iv) to create a stronger role for the private sector, both in
terms of investment and creating job opportunities; (v) to improve productivity and promote competition;
(vi) to reduce poverty by 30 percent from 2007 levels by focusing on comprehensive rural development,
job creation, and provision of basic services such as education and healthcare services, particularly for
vulnerable groups such as youth and women; (vii) to establish a spatial development trend characterized
by a fair distribution of infrastructure and public services; (viii) to focus on sustainable development that
balances economic, social, and environmental considerations, thereby using available natural resources in
a sustainable way; and (ix) to strengthen the role of local governments to take charge of local economic
development and delivery of services to the people.
46.
To achieve these objectives, the NDP proposes an investment program of 218 trillion Iraqi
dinars, or US$186 billion over the plan period, of which US$100 billion would be funded by the federal
budget and the remaining US$86 billion would be funded by the private sector. Sector priorities in the
NDP include oil, electricity, agriculture, transportation and communication, and regional development.
Higher priority is given to the oil (15 percent of total proposed investment) and electricity (10 percent of
total proposed investment) sectors. Agriculture is seen as important from the perspective of economic
diversification, food security, employment opportunities generation, and reducing poverty and migration
to urban areas. The transportation and communications sectors are deemed critical in terms of enhancing
connectivity with other sectors. Similarly, the NDP reserves 12.5 percent of its investments for the
regional development program, and 17 percent of total Government investment (or higher depending on
the next population census) to the KRG. Finally, the NDP allocates 22 percent of the Government

14

investment program to the social sectors. The NDP recognizes that investment alone is not sufficient and
proposes complementary policy and institutional reforms, and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation
of the NDP. The NDP is in the process of being updated to cover the period 2013-17.
47.
The Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), developed with the support of the Bank and adopted in
January 2009, complements the NDP in its focus on poverty. Both strategies share a common goal of
reducing poverty by 30 percent, from 23 percent in 2009 to 16 percent in 2014, through higher incomes
and better health, education, social protection and housing services for the poor. In addition, the PRS
sets out specific goals in terms of human development: (i) reduce the illiteracy rate by half (from 28
percent to 14 percent), and raise the net enrollment rate in primary education (from 75 percent to 98
percent), in intermediate education (from 21 percent to 50 percent), and in secondary education (from 23
percent to 40 percent); (ii) reduce the number of individuals covered by the food ration card and restrict
coverage to those who are below the poverty line by 2014; and (iii) bridge the gender gap, including
through higher women participation in the labor force, and higher ratios of girls to boys in literacy and
primary and secondary education.

A.

BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

Lessons Learned from Previous Engagement and Stakeholder Feedback

48.
Despite an extremely challenging operating environment and security conditions, the Bank
Group over the past three Interim Strategy Notes (ISNs) has achieved some successes, and has
learned a number of lessons which will inform the present CPS. The need for realism, for leveraging
the Government’s own vast resources, and for having strong government ownership and reform
champions are the main lessons learned during the implementation of the last ISN series.
49.
Following a long period of disengagement, the Bank made a decision to reengage in Iraq at
the time of the Iraq Donor Conference in Madrid in 2003. The initial post-conflict reconstruction
program, the bulk of which was designed in 2004-05, was wide-ranging and ambitious, with the Bank
involved in nearly all sectors and optimism regarding expected improvements in the security and political
situation in the country. There was strong pressure for the World Bank, as other donors, to respond very
quickly to the reconstruction and recovery needs. Projects were thus prepared on a very rapid timetable
with limited knowledge of the country context, sectors and the institutional environment. As a result,
much of what normally would be accomplished during project preparation was left to be addressed during
project implementation. When, contrary to expectations, the situation in Iraq deteriorated, the operating
environment became untenable. The Bank tried to mitigate risks and adapt to the changing realities, but
the complex political and authorizing environment were not conducive to such adaptation. Another
feature of Iraq’s post-conflict environment was the exodus of the technical and professional cadre, and
this had an impact on the Government’s ability to implement the program. Experience points to the need
to be more alert to the changing circumstances, and to be more candid as to the political economy of
conflict-affected situations and the limitations of donors’ intervention in such environments. Experience
also shows that political considerations, while always important to bear in mind, need to be managed so as
to avoid impossible mandates and the resulting failures. In view of the limited capacity of the
Government, and with the bulk of the Bank’s current post-conflict lending assistance winding down, this
CPS presents an opportunity to apply the lessons learned from the Bank Group’s past engagement and to
deliver technical and financial support to maximize the effectiveness of Iraq’s own resources.
50.
The Bank Group should be realistic about its role and potential for impact in a
resource-rich country with a difficult operating environment. The size of the Bank-supported
program is very small relative to the Iraqi budget. This fact, combined with a natural preoccupation with
domestic political and security issues and a history of isolation from international best practice, resulted in

15

a lack of traction on the Government side. This situation would have required intensive, on-the-ground
supervision and implementation support by World Bank task teams, but this approach was not possible
due to the difficult security situation and the limited ability of Bank staff to work directly with
counterparts on the ground. The use of the Bank’s agent on the ground, the Fiduciary Management Agent
(FMA) (Box 1), was an innovative solution that offset the lack of access and provided a good level of
fiduciary oversight. Over the past few years, the Bank was also able to increase its presence on the ground
and bring the dialogue closer to the client. Although the Bank has accomplished a great deal under
unusual circumstances, it remains to be seen whether the existing portfolio will have satisfactory
outcomes considering the operating environment. If the security situation were to deteriorate again in a
significant way, lessons learned indicate the need for an appropriate level of expectations on results and
careful management decisions as to the degree of Bank Group engagement.
Box 1: Portfolio and Supervision Arrangements
Unconventional Supervision: Use of a Fiduciary Management Agent in Iraq
Since 2004, the Bank has used a group of Iraqi engineers, financial management, and procurement professionals as a
Fiduciary Management Agent (FMA) to assist in monitoring, supervision and capacity building for the investment
portfolio, and in helping ensure compliance with Bank fiduciary standards and guidelines. Experience with the FMA has
been positive, with the FMA acting as the Bank’s eyes and ears on the ground, particularly when some areas are
inaccessible. The FMA visits sites, documents physical works and sends monthly reports on procurement and financial
management. This is arguably a much broader scope of coverage than is carried out for most Bank projects around the
world.
The FMA contract is renewed annually and is subject to satisfactory performance as confirmed by annual evaluations,
feedback from which is fed back into contract performance indicators. The FMA participates in all official Bank
supervision missions, follows up regularly with the Project Management Teams on implementation of actions identified
during supervision, and flags as necessary issues in project implementation worthy of management attention.
The FMA arrangement is working well and the mechanism will continue to be used for as long as the security situation
restricts Bank staff access to project sites across Iraq. Intensity of FMA services will decrease as most projects close in
2013; however this will still be an option for future IBRD projects.

51.
One key challenge for IFC’s involvement in Iraq over the last few years has been to find the
right local partners. The private sector is small and faces serious capacity issues. A key element in going
forward will be to identify and support local investors who have the potential to grow, can embrace best
practices in how to conduct their businesses, and are able to effectively work with IFC and other
International Financial Institutions.
52.
Against this background, the Bank Group will focus efforts on knowledge transfer and
ensure that financial support leverages Iraq’s own resources while delivering needed technical
assistance to enhance capacity of the Government and private sector institutions. Iraq now has
considerable resources at its disposal, but its capacity to plan and implement development programs is
still too weak. During CPS consultations, Government stakeholders indicated that transfer of knowledge,
provision of advisory services and capacity building were considered high priorities for Bank assistance.
53.
Going forward, the Bank will ensure that its interventions are responsive to client demand
and receptivity to reform. In a number of areas, client engagement, capacity and ability to carry out
reforms have been low. Based on experience, the Bank will focus on undertaking activities to which the
Government is engaged and committed.
54.
Lessons from the 2011 World Development Report (WDR) are also being applied in this
CPS. For example, a Community Driven Development (CDD) approach has been piloted successfully
in KRG, and work is underway to expand this program. The CPS also provides greater focus on gender,
regional and cross-border initiatives, and a major focus on service delivery as a way to build up
confidence in the effectiveness and credibility of the State.
16

Multi-stakeholder Consultations
55.
A wide variety of stakeholders confirmed the need for support from the Bank in rebuilding
the capacity of state institutions to lead policy reforms, implement the Government’s development
programs and deliver services to the people. The Bank carried out several intensive consultation
missions and met with a variety of stakeholders, including senior government officials, project
management teams, donor representatives, and members of civil society in Baghdad, Erbil, Basra, Dohuk,
Mosul and Al-Muthanna. Electronic media was also used to support the CPS consultation process and
reach a wider audience. Consultations broadly confirmed the strategic thrust of the Bank's proposed
approach, focusing primarily on supporting Iraq to plan and properly use its own financial resources,
design and implement institutional reforms needed to spur economic diversification and create jobs, and
increase its capacity for service delivery. Strengthened capacity of public institutions—both at the
central and local government levels—was underscored by all stakeholders.
Current World Bank Group Portfolio
56.
Since 2004, the World Bank has supported Iraq’s reconstruction and development through
a US$1 billion program. This includes US$500 million in Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) grants and an
exceptional International Development Association (IDA) allocation of US$500 million in credits. The
program has supported a number of areas, including infrastructure reconstruction in water, power, and
roads, education and health, private sector development, telecoms, social protection, public financial
management and reform of the two state-owned banks. In 2010, the IBRD financed a US$250 million
Development Policy Loan which supported strengthening budget management and prioritization;
reforming the financial sector; and improving the efficiency of the social protection system.
57.
As of September 30, 2012, Iraq’s total active ITF and IDA portfolio of 25 projects amounted
to US$860 million, with 54 percent disbursed. This included: 11 projects financed by ITF grants
amounting to US$316 million (76 percent disbursed); five IDA investment lending operations amounting
to US$508.5 million (39 percent disbursed); and three grants from Bank-administered trust funds (the
State and Peace Building Fund (SPBF), the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF), and the EITI Trust
Fund). Iraq is also a member of the Global Gas Flaring Reduction initiative led by the Bank Group.
Combined, the Water, Sanitation and Urban Development Sectors make up the largest share of the
portfolio at 33 percent followed by Electricity/Energy, and Education at 21 percent and 19 percent,
respectively (Figure 7).

A gender review of the Iraq portfolio was undertaken to inform this CPS. Much of the
existing portfolio consists of reconstruction and recovery projects designed in 2004-2006 and set to close
in the coming year or two. The portfolio focused on emergency reconstruction and recovery needs, and
while certain activities did address gender directly, gender considerations were not mainstreamed in the
design. Going forward, the gender review identified entry points for a greater focus on gender (Box 2).
Box 2: Observations from a Gender Review of the Iraq Portfolio
A review of the Iraq portfolio points to a number of areas where the Bank’s work has had a gender focus. The 2007 household
survey, carried out under difficult and dangerous conditions, was the most comprehensive socio-economic survey ever
undertaken in Iraq. It captured sex-disaggregated data, particularly for social and economic indicators. On the basis of this
survey the Iraqi authorities developed an official poverty line and the first Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2010. A new
household survey is expected to be completed by December 2012, following which the data will be compiled. This will
provide updated sex-disaggregated data on which a Gender and Poverty Assessment to be done in FY14 will be based. The
Bank is also providing TA to help Iraq reform its Public Distribution System with special efforts for household targeting tools
to be sensitive to the gender of the household head and address vulnerabilities such as Internally Displaced Persons and
widows.
On education, the National Education Strategy includes a policy for increasing girls’ enrollment which will benefit from
insights in the new household survey. The Emergency Health Project has a special focus on vulnerable groups, including
pregnant women and children. Due to the low number of female healthcare professionals and social sensitivities of using
healthcare facilities run by males, the project is expanding the number of women health volunteers and using mobile health
clinics. While gender considerations were not necessarily integrated into the design of the Capacity Building 2 project, a
series of workshops were held on Leadership Skills for Policy Reform for Iraqi Female Parliamentarians. The upcoming
Water Sector Strategy could be a good entry point for looking at gender disaggregated data where it exists and gaining a better
understanding of the different roles and needs of men and women with regard to water and sanitation services.
In Private Sector Development (PSD), gender has been integrated into activities, including: measures to help the Regulatory
Reform Unit identify and address gender issues when developing new policies; a more inclusive approach to consulting with
NGOs; giving priority to women in the provision of microfinance loans; and to gender issues in dialogue and programs
provided by Iraq business associations through the Private Sector Development Center. The ICA included diagnostics on
women and gender issues. Sex-disaggregated data and analysis will be an important resource for informing PSD activities
going forward, particularly in light of Iraq’s goal of increasing women’s share of non-agricultural waged work. Gender is also
very relevant in the Youth Livelihood Project which includes promoting women’s participation in life/work skills training.
Going forward, the forthcoming poverty and gender assessment will provide updated data to inform the Bank-supported
projects in the pipeline. While the household survey will be key to providing gender disaggregated data along many important
welfare dimensions, efforts will also be made to collect project-level data, particularly in areas where the survey data will fall
short, such as infrastructure. Finally, the Bank will emphasize gender mainstreaming in its dialogue with the Government on
the update of Iraq’s Poverty Reduction Strategy and the Government’s budget.

59.
Portfolio performance has improved, but the implementation environment remains
challenging. The security situation in Iraq has improved and the pace of project implementation has
increased considerably since 2006. However, conditions on the ground continue to hamper mobility of
Bank staff and Project Management Teams, consultants and contractors. Security conditions also
discourage local and international contactors from bidding and substantially increase project costs. The
Bank’s Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (see Box 1) continues to support the Bank’s project supervision
efforts through physical verification and monitoring of procurement and financial management.
Procedures and institutional capacity constraints in line ministries (e.g., unclear lines of authority,
inefficient review, approval, and oversight procedures) further impede project implementation, delaying
decision-making, reporting, and follow up. Contract management has also been a continuing problem in
Iraq, often leading to work of inferior quality or protracted delays in contract implementation. A weak
banking system poses challenges for disbursement. Five projects are currently in problem status. These
projects benefit from heightened supervision (3-4 times per year) and continuous updates and discussions,
including with the Joint Portfolio Oversight Committee (JPOC) co-chaired by the Prime Minister’s
Advisory Board and the World Bank.

18

60.
The Government and the Bank are working to strengthen portfolio performance. The
JPOC meets quarterly, following an Action Plan updated at the June 2011 Country Portfolio Performance
Review (CPPR). The CPPR focused on the need to enhance capacity building, monitoring and
evaluation, incorporate projects into the national budget, and address challenges related to low
disbursements and implementation of Designated Accounts and E-signatures. As most projects move
towards closing by the end of 2013, the focus will be on ensuring that projects disburse existing funds and
have strong monitoring and evaluation systems in place to assess progress towards meeting their
development objectives.
61.
IFC has a growing and diversified investment and advisory portfolio in Iraq. IFC's
investments in Iraq have increased significantly over the last few years, with the portfolio growing from
only US$10 million in FY05 to nearly US$300 million today. In late 2011, IFC established a field
presence in Iraq for the first time by placing a full-time Senior Country Officer in Bagdad. IFC signed an
Establishment Agreement with the Government of Iraq in October 2012 for an official Country Office in
Bagdad (co-located with the Bank), and plans to increase its presence in the field during the CPS period.
IFC’s investments have aimed to support the private sector and leverage regional investments, and will be
complemented by a strong Advisory Services (AS) program during the planned CPS period. IFC’s
portfolio is diverse, and investments have supported the establishment of the Erbil Rotana Hotel, a cement
company, and the banking, telecommunications, and logistics and warehousing sectors (including
through equity investments). Recent large investments include: (i) US$155 million in Zain Telecom; (ii)
US$45 million in a transport and logistics company (Gulftainer); (iii) US$45 million in Lafarge Cement;
and (iii) around US$35 million in the financial and hotel sectors. While IFC’s early investments in the
cement sector were cancelled due to security and sponsor issues, the current portfolio is performing well
and having an impact on the ground. As the political, policy and security environment shows further
improvement, IFC anticipates strong demand for the financing of private investments in Iraq across a
variety of real and financial sectors. In addition to its investment engagement, IFC has started to provide
advisory support in the areas of investment climate, financial infrastructure strengthening, capacity
building of the banking/MSME sector and bank risk management, selective SME management training
(especially targeting women), and the promotion of public-private partnerships in collaboration with the
World Bank. IFC advisory support in Iraq has tried to focus on gender aspects, especially through its
access to finance and Business Edge programs. IFC has been active in training banking staff in modern
banking practices, training events targeting Iraqi business women, and has made early efforts to
specifically support private sector-led development of the local construction industry. IFC’s advisory
work is supported by the US$38 million multi-donor Iraq Business Advisory Fund (IBAF) provided by
the US, United Kingdom (UK), Spain, and Japan: US$10 million of this funding is earmarked for
microfinance investments. MIGA has supported one investment in the manufacturing sector thus far.
B.

Proposed World Bank Group Partnership Strategy

62.
The overarching objective of the World Bank Group engagement will be to support the
country’s efforts to build stronger government institutions and a more diversified and regionallyintegrated economy that can deliver services and create jobs. This objective is supported by three
pillars which are aligned with the emphasis of the MENA Regional Framework on governance,
sustainable private sector-led growth, job creation and inclusion. These are: (1) improving governance;
(2) supporting economic diversification for broadly-shared prosperity; and (3) improving social inclusion
and reducing poverty. IFC will contribute to the strategy through an integrated program of advisory and
investment work to help diversify the economy away from the oil sector. This will be done by
developing a favorable business and regulatory environment and fostering responsive institutions to
strengthen job-creating, private sector-led growth in the non-oil sectors. MIGA will mainly contribute to
Pillar 2.

19

63.
The Bank is moving from Interim Strategy Notes to a Country Partnership Strategy. This
shift responds to the Government’s request for a deeper and more substantial engagement and represents a
longer-term Bank commitment. This is the first World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy for
Iraq with a fully integrated IBRD, IFC and MIGA program. The Bank Group aims to accompany the
country through the CPS period, supporting the Government in making important policy choices that will
set the stage for the country’s development. The four-year timeframe covered by the CPS will also allow
planning within a longer time horizon, in keeping with the 2011 WDR recommendations for countries
emerging from conflict. It will also serve as a bridge between a concessionally-financed reconstruction
and recovery investment portfolio and a forward-looking, demand-driven program.
64.
The World Bank Group’s program will emphasize knowledge transfer, using all the
available instruments, including AAA, lending and reimbursable services. A key feature of the
Bank’s support lies in bringing global knowledge and experience to the table and connecting Iraq with
international practitioners. Exposure to other country experiences has proven to be very useful in Iraq’s
case given that the country has emerged from war and isolation and has experienced an exodus of skilled
civil servants. The Bank is committed to serving as a broker of knowledge and will bring to bear
solutions for Iraq’s most pressing development challenges in the coming years.
65.
A proposed program is outlined under the Pillars to support this agenda. Analytical and
advisory activities include, inter alia, follow-up work to a Public Expenditure Review, a Report on Oil
Revenue Management for Economic Diversification, a Poverty and Gender Assessment, Agriculture
Technical Assistance, a Gas Master System Study, and Financial Sector Dialogue. IBRD projects
amounting to US$540 million have been identified starting in FY14 for five projects, including:
Integrated Financial Management Information Systems; Governance; Trade and Transport Corridors;
Irrigation and Water Resources; and Water Supply and Sewerage. In addition, a program of
Reimbursable Services is being developed. While the future program will be largely demand-driven, and
IBRD lending will be pursued only in the presence of strong government ownership, there are areas which
are seen to be high priorities for Bank engagement due to their integral role in the country’s development.
These include governance, financial sector development, and gender.
66.
Trust Funds play an important role in the Bank’s program in Iraq and are fully integrated
into the Strategy. Most importantly, the US$532 million Iraq Trust Fund will close during the CPS
period. The EITI Trust Fund is an important part of Pillar 1, while Pillar 2 benefits substantially from a
US$13.2 Private Sector Development Trust Fund 11. Pillar 3 is supported by a successful State and Peace
Building Fund Community Driven Development pilot in the KRG as well as JSDF grants.
67.
The following table elaborates ongoing, planned, and potential support under the main pillars of
engagement.



Result Area 1: Improving Governance

CPS Outcome Areas:
1. Improved transparency and efficiency of oil revenue management and public spending
2. Achievement of one or more features of the Governance Action Plan
68.
Low institutional capacity hampers the optimal use of Iraq’s existing wealth of natural and
financial resources. Building on the ongoing engagement in the management of public finances, the
Bank will continue to support improvements in institutional capacity and governance through technical
assistance to improve Government-wide systems and practices, public financial management,
transparency in oil revenue management (particularly through the continuation of the ongoing EITI
program), a joint training program with the IMF and World Bank Treasury Department on debt reporting
and management, and focused attention on governance issues at the sector level. The Bank will also
support the Government on institutional reforms and capacity building to strengthen the state’s oversight
and control capabilities. The Central Bank of Iraq has expressed interest in participating in the World
Bank Treasury Reserves Advisory Management Program which helps build capacity in central banks to
manage reserves.
69.
Sound fiscal and macroeconomic policy, including transparency of oil revenues, is critical
for Iraq’s development. The Bank will help to put in place an analytical framework for informed
decision-making on the allocation of its overall resource envelope. The 2012 reports on Economic
Diversification for Oil Revenue Management and Public Expenditure Review (PER) provide a diagnostic
base for developing a macro-fiscal framework to assist Iraqi policy makers in measuring petroleum
financial flows and making informed spending and saving decisions consistent with the Government’s
economic vision. This work is aimed at helping the Government address key issues in revenue
management and spending efficiency and will be followed up by support on implementation.
70.
The ongoing PFM Reform Project will deliver improved business processes in budget
preparation, budget execution, and public procurement and capacity building of the Ministry of
Finance Accounting Training Center so that it can conduct future training of Ministry of Finance
staff in a sustainable manner. The project will also deliver and test a prototype for an Integrated
Financial Management System (IFMIS) in three ministries and three governorate treasuries by June 2013.
If tested successfully, the Government intends to ‘pilot’ the system in selected ministries and treasuries as
the 'primary' system in 2014 and will ‘go live’ with the system in all ministries and treasuries in 2015.
This will be supported through a new IBRD project of US$40 million in FY14. The PFM project
includes a capacity building component for the Board of Supreme Audit (BSA) to strengthen Iraq’s
accountability mechanisms. The Bank helped draft a consolidated Procurement Law and will continue
to support procurement reform through the development of a single portal website for procurement
notices and the development of sector bidding documents.
71.
The Bank Group is engaged in a structured dialogue around transparency, accountability
and participation and has worked with the Government to develop a draft Governance Action
Plan. The Bank will support the implementation of the Governance Action Plan, including development
of a law on Access to Information. Bank activities will stress the importance of citizen participation,
including women, in the design and implementation of government programs. In areas where the Bank
maintains sectoral dialogue with the Government, the Bank will support the Government in developing
the practice of public consultations. The Bank will also look at social accountability measures in sectors
where this might be feasible on a pilot basis. The Bank will also support the Government’s efforts on
decentralization and local governance with the aim of facilitating a constructive and informed debate on
decentralization policy in Iraq which fits its specific context and constitutional requirements. The
Government has expressed its interest in an IBRD project in FY15 for the Budget Directorate on

22

Governance.
72.
Other capacity building efforts that have shown traction and will be continued include
working closely with the Government on strategy development, including the National Poverty
Reduction Strategy, Integrated National Energy Strategy, Education Strategy, and pensions and social
safety nets (see Annex 3). This includes bringing Iraqi officials to see examples of other country policies
and practices and engaging in discussion with international practitioners. This approach has been
successful and brings to bear the World Bank’s comparative advantage of sharing global knowledge and
international practice to a country that has been isolated through decades of war. The Bank will support
“on-the-job” training in terms of capacity building including, where appropriate, supporting a move from
conventional construction contracts towards “Design-Build-Operate” / turnkey contracts to provide more
Iraqi staff with the experience required to manage future investments, while also building capacity in the
private sector.


Result Area 2: Supporting Economic Diversification for Broadly-Shared Prosperity

CPS Outcome Areas:
1. Strengthened approaches to an improved business environment
2. Strengthened supervisory framework for financial intermediation and capacity of financial institutions
3. Strengthened infrastructure services
73.
The Bank Group will support the Government’s efforts towards economic diversification.
This will be done through policy advice and analysis in support of building an enabling environment for
private sector development, reforming the financial sector, and encouraging public-private partnerships,
Public-Private Dialogue and trade facilitation. While the diversification challenge cuts across numerous
policy domains, enhancing the environment for private sector development is certainly at the core of the
agenda. It is through the private sector, and not further increases in the size of the public sector, that new
jobs will be created and broad-based economic development can be achieved. The Bank Group’s
interventions will support efforts for bringing more women into the workforce.
74.
The Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) identified several reform areas that should be
undertaken to address the major concerns of firms in Iraq. Electricity is a top constraint. Other
concerns include Access to Finance; Access to Land; Access to Labor and Gender Equality; Access to
Infrastructure, including power supply, water, transport and trade; SOE Reform; Control of Corruption;
and Informality. The Bank has identified policy reform recommendations and stands ready to assist in
any of these areas.
75.
Through the Private Sector Development Trust Fund, the Bank will continue to support the
Government’s efforts to restructure the SOE sector and create a level playing field for private
sector investment in productive activities. This includes support in identifying SOEs that are ready for
reform, working to reform 180 SOEs, and strengthening the capacity of Ministries to lead reform efforts,
for example in budget and business planning, labor restructuring and performance management.
Additional Technical Assistance (TA) will support the establishment and operation of an SOE “Asset
Valuation Unit” within the Ministry of Finance to improve oversight of SOE assets. The Bank will also
support the establishment and operation of Regulatory Reform Units to provide oversight and improved
quality control over business regulations. Gender aspects are integrated into the PSD Trust Fund taking
into account the low female labor force participation rate (among the lowest in the region) and the
concentration of women in the public sector. IFC will also support reforms in corporate governance and
investment climate, including and jointly with the Bank’s follow up to the ICA, improving the
construction permit process as one starting point where there is clear demand from the Government, and
thus providing a platform for further reforms. Finally, the Bank will continue providing advisory support
23

for regulatory reform at the national and subnational levels, including for starting a business.
76.
The World Bank and IFC advisory services will support the Government’s introduction of
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in Iraq. The Bank Group is currently supporting PPP legislation
prepared by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the rollout of PPP
pilots and technical assistance to several ministries, including the Ministry of Electricity, Ministry of
Industry and Minerals, and the Ministry of Construction and Housing. Such activities will be
complemented where possible by the use of the Technical Advisory Facility of the Arab Financing
Facility for Infrastructure. IFC is ready to engage in supporting the implementation of the PPP program
in the electricity and transport sectors and will explore the associated financing opportunities in
partnership with MIGA. The World Bank and IFC could also assist in the process of privatizing existing
assets or introducing private sector management to non-infrastructure-related services.
77.
MIGA will continue to support Iraq’s efforts to attract foreign private investors through
the provision of political risk guarantees. Supporting investments in fragile and conflict-affected
environments is one of MIGA’s global strategic pillars, and therefore Iraq is a focus country for MIGA
engagement. Having already supported one manufacturing investment project, MIGA remains open to
supporting investments into Iraq from all countries, including South-based and regional investors. Iraq's
membership in MIGA is recent (2008) and MIGA’s activities in Iraq will further develop as demand for
its services is expected to increase. MIGA’s program will be aligned with the broader WBG strategy and
activities and focus on agribusiness, finance, services, telecommunications and infrastructure. Private
investors have shown interest in partnering with MIGA for investments into Iraq and MIGA stands ready
to support sustainable projects with a high development impact, including through its Small Investment
Program.
78.
Reforming the financial sector is at the heart of the economic diversification strategy for
Iraq. The Bank supported the development and adoption of an action plan that includes improving
access to finance for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and modernizing financial sector
regulation and governance. The Bank will continue to support the Government’s effort at reforming the
state-owned banks – Al-Rashid and Al-Rafidain – and removing the barriers for private banks in doing
business with the Government and state-owned banks. The Bank’s program will focus on helping the
Government to create a better enabling environment to allow access to finance, including improving the
credit systems, contract enforcement, and bankruptcy regulations. The Bank will also support the
alignment of the system to international standards, as well as help in strengthening governance structures.
The ongoing Banking Sector Reform project is supporting this work and helping build up the Central
Bank of Iraq’s capacities in banking and financial sector supervision. IFC will provide a combination of
advisory and investment support for regional and international investors in Iraq and promote reforms
related to Access to Finance and investment climate, including improvements in financial infrastructure
and support to private banks to expand credit to microfinance institutions and SMEs. The WBG’s efforts
to improve access to finance for SMEs and regulatory reforms will be gender informed. For example,
gender differences in ability to open a bank account, sign a contract, register a business, and manage
property will be considered. IFC will provide training to SMEs, especially women entrepreneurs,
through its Business Edge Program.
79.
Trade reforms and regional integration will help economic diversification. The Bank will
provide analysis and recommendations through analytical work, Economic Complementarity and Deeper
Regional Integration: Iraq, Turkey and the Mashreq. This is in line with the WBG Trade Strategy which
includes supporting diversification and improving trade facilitation and complementary policies that can
improve competitiveness. Support for customs modernization and trade and transport facilitation are
also important areas of support and a US$200 million Trade and Transport Facilitation IBRD Project is

24

under preparation.
80.
The Bank will help Iraq improve the quality and delivery of its core infrastructure services
through a combination of investments and institutional development. The Bank will seek to help
Iraq prepare and implement strategic plans in the critical energy, transport, and water sectors, as well as
building the necessary capacity to plan and implement its own investments. In the energy sector, this
includes support for the Iraq National Energy Strategy (INES), as well as analytical work and technical
assistance on policy, strategy, governance and institutional development in the power and gas sectors,
including the upcoming Gas Master System study. Under existing programs, the Bank will continue its
work on the rehabilitation of Dokan and Derbandikhan and the Hartha Power Plants. Regarding transport,
the Government has asked the Bank Group for help with institutional reform and capacity building for
transport infrastructure management, particularly in terms of transport access in relation to trade
facilitation, and customs modernization. A transport sector master plan and strategy (including rail,
road, air, and urban sectors) is under preparation, as well as identification of capacity building and
technical assistance needs and an investment plan for the short, medium and long term. In
telecommunications, the Bank will seek to build on its successful engagement in Iraq through the ITF
PSD project. A follow-on technical assistance program is being explored, most likely as a reimbursable
service. In particular, the Bank could support development of various mobile applications, organize
seminars and workshops to share international best practice, bridge capacity and knowledge gaps on
various policy and regulatory issues, and play the role of honest broker by bringing all public and private
stakeholders together on one platform to advance the telecom. Gender-sensitive approaches to
infrastructure programs will be pursued to enhance productivity, incomes, and provide more equitable
access.
81.
IFC is well-positioned to mobilize financing to a number of projects in these key sectors as
well. IFC and MIGA will support South-South investments, particularly from existing clients interested
in expansion to Iraq (e.g. from the GCC, Jordan, and Turkey). Mobilization of additional funding from
financial institutions, similar to what was achieved for earlier successful efforts to finance Iraq’s
telecommunications backbone, will remain a key feature of IFC’s strategy.
82.
Sound management of natural resources and environmental protection are critical for Iraq
to sustain its economic development agenda. This includes supporting the development and
implementation of a comprehensive national environment and natural resources management action plan
that prioritizes environmental issues in national planning and budget allocation. Priority areas include
urban environment, rehabilitation of agricultural land, and water resources management. A new US$140
million Irrigation and Water Management/Water Resources Project is proposed for FY14: this project
would build on the success of the existing Community Infrastructure Project and focus on the
rehabilitation of irrigation systems, including efforts to rebuild local Iraqi water user associations. The
Bank also stands ready to bring to bear its expertise to help the Government address climate change
issues, given Iraq’s high vulnerability. The Global Gas Flaring Reduction (GGFR) Initiative has
proposed US$1.4 million for Iraq GGFR work from 2013-15. A Gas Pricing Study will be undertaken as
well as the Gas Master System Study which aims to propose an overall strategy and an implementation
plan for the development of the gas industry.


Result Area 3: Improving Social Inclusion and Reducing Poverty

CPS Outcome Areas:
1. Improved delivery of health, education, and water supply services
2. Strengthened capacity to develop, manage and monitor social protection reforms
83.

The Bank Group will seek to help the Government develop its capacity to deliver efficient
25

services in health, education and social protection, while also improving targeting mechanisms to
deliver support to the most vulnerable. Under existing programs, the Bank will support school
construction and capacity building for teacher training and curriculum development. The Bank has also
supported the development of the National Education Strategy. This work will try to provide a
foundation for greater women’s participation in the labor force through education policy. In the coming
years, Bank support could include: (i) capacity building for the implementation of the national education
strategy by supporting the Government in developing an implementation plan and the design of priority
programs; (ii) involving Iraq in global and regional initiatives, such as MENA Region’s Workforce
Development (WfD) project under the System Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) and the
University Governance Score Card (UGSC) 12; (iii) a policy note to take stock of the current situation
regarding quality of education and skills development in Iraq using the newly available data from WfD,
UGSC and other initiatives and incorporating the planned developments in the new education strategy 13;
and (iv) skills development and readiness for the labor market.
84.
In health, the Bank Group will focus on improvements in management capacity and
efficiency of the sector, following on the recent recommendation for a Public Expenditure Review in the
sector. In response to a request from the Minister of Health for assistance in the areas of building,
expanding and operating emergency medical services and e-governance, the Bank will build on the recent
experiences in establishing similar emergency medical services in Kurdistan through the Regional Health
Emergency Response Project. The Bank will continue to work in close partnership with the World
Health Organization which has been working closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH) to support the
Iraq Public Sector Modernization Program. IFC, in turn, will work to identify viable investment
opportunities in the health sector that enable existing health providers to grow and attract South-South
investments in the health sector.
85.
In the water supply sector, the Bank Group would continue helping the Government
prepare the analytical base for sustainable delivery of water services across the country, including
an institutional and regulatory framework for the water supply and wastewater sector. Under the
existing portfolio, the Bank will continue to implement its programs of support for the rehabilitation of
municipal water supplies, including in Baghdad. A new Water Supply and Sewerage (Baghdad) project
for US$100 million is proposed for FY15.
86.
Under the rubric of social protection, the Bank Group will continue its engagement in labor
markets, poverty reduction, social safety nets, and pension reforms, building on the available data to
allow for a deeper evidence-based dialogue on social protection reforms. The Bank could also support
Iraq in implementing its National Employment Strategy. The successful Household Survey work and
ensuing Poverty Reduction Strategy are being followed up by an update of the Household Survey.
Technical work will be carried out to assess Iraq’s social subsidies and will make policy
recommendations to move Iraq beyond the universal Public Distribution System to a differentiated model
that continues to protect the poorest and most vulnerable. Additional policy development and
implementation support could be provided on safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer programs to
improve education and health outcomes among youth and women, and pensions, where significant
capacity is being built at the National Board of Pensions (NBP) to help expand coverage beyond the
current level of 20 percent of the population. Additionally, the Bank is supporting a community-driven
development approach to basic service delivery in the KRG and could expand this work over the CPS
12

These initiatives will collect comprehensive data to provide diagnostic information on the system which can be used for further
policy development and could lead to additional work to enhance employability of graduates and the relevance of the acquired
knowledge and skills to the labor market.
13
The policy note would lay the foundation for targeted support in the important area of skills development and students’ readiness for
the labor market.

26

period.
87.
The CPS intends to help the Government reach its medium-term objective of providing
opportunities for women’s empowerment with equity and justice. The Bank will carry out a Gender
and Poverty Assessment in Iraq in FY14, informed by the Household Survey that will be completed by
end of 2012. This work will aim to mainstream gender into the poverty work to provide a full and
comprehensive assessment and will inform the development of a National Gender Strategy. The
National Gender Strategy will focus on raising the status of women through the reform of economic and
legal institutions to ensure equal rights and opportunities for men and women (family law, protection from
violence, property ownership, employment, political rights and inheritance laws) with a view to reach the
objective of achieving gender equity in power and resource distribution and to meet MDG targets by
through continuing to promote women’s empowerment in productive economic sectors such as
agriculture, water, and energy. The gender assessment will inform dialogue and technical support on
social protection reform to improve targeting and outcomes. The gender assessment will also be used to
inform policy dialogue more broadly. The Bank will continue to work with the Government to establish
the evidence base regarding the effects of gender equality in poverty reduction operations, build the
gender-mainstreaming capacity of its clients, and partner with other stakeholders on gender equality and
women’s economic empowerment.
C.

Implementing the FY13-16 Country Partnership Strategy

88.
Iraq’s complex political agenda, security challenges and global economic uncertainty imply
that the Bank Group needs to be flexible, opportunistic, and ready to adapt to changing
circumstances. This strategy is a living document that lays out priorities for Iraq today but will need to
be periodically reviewed for relevance in light of changing circumstances. The Bank Group’s
investment and analytical and advisory work programs will be reviewed with the Government through
Country Program Reviews, and activities will be updated based on the Government’s emerging priorities
and the quality of engagement with partner institutions.
89.
The Bank will seek to ensure that IBRD financing for Iraq during the CPS period leverages
Iraq’s own resources and has strong government ownership and reform champions. Iraq has
considerable resources at its disposal for public investment, development and poverty reduction, but
absorptive capacity remains low. The Bank’s main comparative advantage will be in providing the
underlying analysis for policy development and providing technical assistance to help build institutional
capacity. Available IBRD resources for Iraq are but a small fraction of Iraq’s annual investment budget
(US$36.7 billion 14 in 2012). Thus, IBRD funding must be used strategically to leverage and provide an
operating framework for the Government’s investment program and to provide knowledge transfer and
good project practice. In addition, and in light of Iraq’s own resources, it is expected that more Bank
support will be carried out on a reimbursable basis as done in other countries in the region and around the
world.
90.
Building on its global knowledge, the Bank will be offering a combination of lending and
knowledge products to better meet the specific needs of Iraq. Knowledge can be delivered through
the entire spectrum of Bank instruments, including IBRD lending, just-in-time policy notes, sectoral
strategies, reimbursable services and economic and sector work to inform the policy decisions and design
of development programs.
91.
The portfolio will continue to be monitored closely, including by regular meetings of the JPOC
and CPPRs. Project supervision will continue to be carried out intensively and increasingly in-country
14

Includes supplemental budget

27

when security permits. Future Bank project support will be designed to meet more robust criteria of
readiness for implementation. Readiness criteria will be monitored in order to facilitate a quick start of
project implementation, for example, the core implementation team being in place as well as prepared
procurement plan and packages, and some contracts ready for signing. In order for the projects to begin in
a timely manner, the Bank team will work with the Government to encourage timely project effectiveness.
92.
IFC’s investment program is expected to remain on an upward trajectory assuming
continued improvement in the domestic security/political environment and sustained investor
confidence. With expanded field presence and business development efforts, investments during the
CPS period will focus on exploring opportunities in sectors that generate employment opportunities (e.g.,
construction, manufacturing, tourism and services), as well as increased access to finance. IFC will
continue to implement its regional South-South investment strategy by partnering with larger MENA
and/or Gulf investors interested in venturing into the Iraqi market. Special attention will be given to
focusing on lagging regions and reaching women with a view to improving the inclusion dimension of
IFC’s program. The implementation of the IFC Advisory Service program foresees a phased approach:
interventions will be segmented and phased over the life of the program to ensure proper relevance and
alignment with the prevailing situation on the ground. The objectives of the Advisory Services program,
in line with national priorities and in coordination with other donors, are to support Iraq’s economic
development, create new investment and employment opportunities and stimulate private sector-led
growth. Based on extensive consultations with the World Bank, donors, GOI and private sector
stakeholders in Iraq, IFC will execute a targeted, multi-pronged private sector development advisory
services program – in tandem with investments – with a focus on: (i) corporate governance; (ii) SME
training though Business Edge; (iii) investment climate reforms (e.g. construction permits); (iv)
implementation of PPPs and privatization support; (v) improvements in financial infrastructure and work
with banks and microfinance institutions to increase access to finance to MSMEs; and (vi) supporting
client- and sector- related sustainable business needs.
Financing of the Program
93.
The expected indicative lending envelope is US$600-900 million during the CPS period.
Actual lending will depend on demand from the authorities based on Iraq’s development priorities,
performance under the CPS, and IBRD lending capacity. The Bank is developing a reimbursable
services program with Iraq: KRG has already indicated its intent to enter into a significant reimbursable
services program with the Bank, details of which are currently being worked out. During the CPS period
FY13-16, IFC plans to continue investing in the private sector with an indicative program of US$100-150
million in commitments per year assuming improvements in the security situation and an operating
environment that is conducive to private sector expansion.
Fostering Stronger Partnerships
94.
While donor assistance played an important role in the country’s reconstruction and
development process, some donors are winding down their development assistance programs in
Iraq. The multi-donor Iraq Trust Fund provided an excellent vehicle for donor cooperation in post-war
Iraq and is an example of good practice in terms of transparency and donor reporting. The Bank also
engages in a mutually reinforcing dialogue with the authorities—together with the IMF—on issues of
common interest. Over the last few years, the Government has improved its capacity to manage aid in
line with the signing of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in May 2008. This includes: the
restructuring of relevant units in the Ministry of Planning in Baghdad and the KRG; training on project
screening and appraisal, management, monitoring and evaluation; and modernization of information
technology. These efforts have gone hand-in-hand with the establishment and improvement of a Donor

28

Assistance Database to capture planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Iraq’s capital
budget (domestic and external resources).
95.
Improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and delivery of development cooperation remains a
challenge. Ongoing security issues, together with the Government’s institutional capacity to lead on
external aid, have impacted the achievements of reconstruction and development efforts. This was
further exacerbated by certain assistance programs that were not well-coordinated among international
agencies and local communities. These developments have made it particularly important for Iraq to
develop strong and well-functioning institutions that can plan, allocate and oversee development
resources in an effective, accountable and transparent manner.
96.
The Bank has established strong partnerships with Iraq’s development partners and will
continue to play a key role in the coordination among Government and development partners.
The key donors, in terms of volume of financial transfers, are the US Agency for International
Development (USAID), the Japanese Government, the World Bank, the European Union, and SIDA.
The International Partners Forum (IPF), jointly chaired by the World Bank and the United Nations
Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), meets monthly to discuss political and economic developments and
to reach consensus for addressing them. In addition to these high-level fora, sector groups coordinate
development partner support in specific areas on the Government’s program. The Bank also uses
informal networking with key donor agencies as a means of coordinating its assistance program with
other donors so as to ensure complementarity, and avoiding risks of overlap. Finally, during the CPS
period the Bank will continue to lead / co-lead groups on public financial management, governance, and
private sector development and provide support to the Prime Minister’s Advisory Council on aid
coordination and effectiveness.
97.
Iraq has a nascent but active CSO sector with over 200 registered CSOs. The most active
CSOs are focused on governance, human rights, democracy, media, human development, women’s rights
and the environment. A few CSOs are particularly vocal on budget issues, corruption and abuse of office,
and the rights of displaced persons, widows and orphans. Only a small number of the CSOs in Iraq have
been established with strong governance structures and have developed close partnerships with local and
international institutions in their field of operations. The Bank will continue to engage CSO leaders in
dialogue and consultations.
Strategic Communications
98.
A communication plan will be important for CPS implementation, both to provide
information to stakeholders and to provoke public debate on development policy issues. To this end,
many of the Bank’s projects and AAA work will support increased stakeholder feedback and
involvement. Many policies (for example, in social and health sector reforms) would benefit from
deeper transparency and public participation on how implementation will occur and how reforms will
impact the lives of citizens. Therefore, the Bank will seek to scale up its communications on its own
work, and assist the Government in doing so more broadly. This could, for example, include working with
the Government and other partners to regularly host workshops and seminars around key policy issues for
a wide audience, in addition to other fora, as well as making use of new interactive technologies that
would allow a broader and more diversified reach.
IV.

MANAGING RISKS

99.
The CPS will be implemented during a period of considerable risk and uncertainty.
Political risks feature most prominently, and these impact security. The 2014 elections are an important
milestone that could influence the ability of the Bank Group to deliver on the CPS program. Tension,
29

infighting, and conflict could become more pronounced as the election approaches, making reform
increasingly difficult to accomplish. Under these circumstances, it is important for the Bank to focus on
what is possible, help sustain momentum within the Government’s economic development program, and
build support for reforms across all parts of the coalition government as well as with civil society and the
private sector. Given the volatility of the political and security environment and the upcoming elections,
the CPS will remain flexible and will strategically adapt its engagement to respond to the evolving
situation on the ground. The CPS Progress Report provides a good opportunity to make adjustments to
the strategy if necessary, and the timing of its delivery can also be adjusted to respond to country
circumstances. In addition to these issues, and related to the political situation in the country, a lack of
consultation and consensus within Government on policy reform may lead to fragmented and dissonant
policy choices that that are not aligned with the Bank’s recommendations, and this could compromise the
impact of the Bank’s strategy in Iraq. The Bank will continue to make policy recommendations and
provide technical assistance and access to best practice and international experience in order to inform
policy making to the greatest extent possible. However, these risks are difficult to fully mitigate, and it
should be recognized that the Bank Group’s influence is limited.
100. With its largely oil-based economy, Iraq is vulnerable to oil price fluctuations. The global
economic crisis is putting downward pressure on oil prices and this could impact the Government’s ability
to finance its budget from oil revenues. While Iraq should not (and is unlikely to) abandon its efforts to
integrate more fully into the global economy, prudent macroeconomic management will remain key to
providing the fiscal space for the Government to adjust appropriately to external shocks when they occur.
The Bank will seek to help the Government mitigate this risk, including through policy advice.
101. Another external shock that may impact Iraq is regional instability, including spillover
from Syria which could jeopardize the whole region. Should regional instability spill over to Iraq,
creating implementation difficulties for the Bank’s strategy, necessary adjustments to the program will be
made and, if appropriate, the CPS Progress Report will be accelerated. Under such a scenario, IFC
business development and ramping up of an IFC investment program would be difficult: IFC would
focus on portfolio management and engaging through its advisory arm on a selective basis.
102. The Iraq program also remains subject to project management and fiduciary risks,
including environmental and social safeguards aspects. In the current environment of political
uncertainty and corruption, program-specific risks assume even greater prominence. In addition, the
operating environment makes supervision challenging. To mitigate these risks, the Bank plans to continue
providing training and to undertake risk-based supervision missions as possible to help build capacity and
ensure that adequate controls are in place for financial transactions and accuracy in financial reporting,
audit and disbursement. A fiduciary monitoring agent carries out fiduciary control and physical
verification activities with reporting to the Bank, and a portfolio specialist has been hired in Baghdad;
however, risks remain in the implementation of Bank-supported projects. To mitigate the safeguards
risks, the Bank will provide training, close monitoring, and review the Environmental and Social
Safeguards Assessment Framework. In the event that political or fiduciary risks seriously undermine the
integrity of the portfolio, appropriate measures will be taken.

Annex 3: Consultation Report
1.
In preparation for the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Iraq, the World Bank held
several consultations in-country as well as through electronic media via the World Bank website to discuss
the proposed strategy and to obtain feedback from various stakeholders. The initial consultations were held
in June 2011 in Baghdad led by the Special Representative. The World Bank met with stakeholder groups,
including Government agencies, representatives of civil society, and donor organizations. The purpose of
the meetings was to present the CPS preparation process, the overarching pillars of the Strategy based on
the past three ISNs, and the current needs of Iraq as aligned with the National Development Plan (NDP),
and to gain an understanding of the Government’s priorities and challenges. At these meetings, all
stakeholders stressed the lack of skills following years of war and the need for continued capacity in all
sectors. They also stressed the importance of security without which all efforts for rehabilitation and
development will fail. All participants stressed the importance of transparency and accountability as the
fundamental building block for recovery and growth. The extreme environmental degradation that Iraq has
suffered following years of war was also highlighted in most meetings.
2.
Formal consultations were later held in May 2012 in Baghdad led by the Country Director and the
Special Representative. The World Bank met with a broad range of stakeholders from the highest levels
of Government, including the Prime Minister, senior members of Cabinet, and Line Ministers, as well as
representatives from civil society and non-governmental organizations, donors, local government, the
media, and members of academia and private sector think tank organizations. During these meetings, the
World Bank highlighted the strategic thrust of the proposed strategy for Iraq for the next four years,
focusing primarily on providing the technical assistance Iraq needs to plan and properly use its own natural
and financial resources, design and implement institutional reforms needed to spur economic
diversification and create jobs, and increase its capacity for service delivery. The Government’s message
was clear that the priority for work with the World Bank is less about access to financial resources but
mainly about the need to increase its own absorptive capacity which has been severely degraded after
decades of sanctions and conflict. Representatives of local governments, donors and civil society
confirmed this view and stressed the need to accelerate priority services and promote private sector
development in the non-oil sectors.
3.
A CPS workshop with Government representatives was held in Baghdad in October 2012, as well
as further consultation meetings with the private sector, private bankers, media, academics, think tanks,
and chambers of commerce throughout the country.
4.
The formal consultations also included field work led by the Special Representative in the
Kurdistan Regional Government as well as the provinces of Al Basrah, Nineveh governorate, Dohuk, and
Al Muthanna where the World Bank met with local governorate officials, civil society representatives and
staff at three World Bank project sites. The project sites included the Um Qasr Al-Zubair dual
carriageway rehabilitation project, a component of the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project (IDA
US$135 million); the Hartha Power Plant of the Emergency Electricity Rehabilitation Project (IDA
US$124 million); and the Emergency Water Supply, Sanitation and Urban Reconstruction Project (ITF
US$110 million).
5.
In the city of Basrah, the largest city in Southern Iraq (population of 3 million) that produces much
of Iraq’s oil wealth, stakeholders who were consulted (government officials and representatives of civil
society) noted that oil does not produce jobs for ordinary people and that Iraq is having a hard time
mobilizing oil money for restoring public services - particularly electricity and water. In addition, the
poor environment due to sand, dust gas flaring, and pollution from burning oil wells is causing a health

37

crisis, including an alarmingly high rate of cancer among children.
6.
From Basrah, the World Bank team travelled to Al-Muthanna via the Um Qasr Al-Zubair dual
carriageway to Iraq’s poorest region where they witnessed first-hand the disastrous environmental impact
of Saddam’s retaliatory policies on the marshlands. Drained marshes were evident on either side of the
road. Al-Muthanna is the largest expanse of Iraq’s territory (20,000 sq. mi) but has a low population
density (about 700,000 inhabitants) dispersed across a vast expanse of mostly desert land. Many of its
inhabitants are Bedouin nomads: the provincial council mourns the difficulties of establishing population
numbers to justify building schools and health clinics, though they admit that there is a critical shortage of
both. Water is scarce, as are jobs. The province is one among a handful of Iraqi provinces that are facing
a perplexing social problem. Women are leaving their husbands in droves and take up housekeeping with
several children in tow but with limited ability to earn a living, given that educational attainment for girls
counts among the lowest for Iraq. Across the region, there is high degree of poverty evidenced by the lack
of school infrastructure, water shortages, poor health indicators and many street urchins wandering about.
7.
Consultations were also held in Mosul, Nineveh Province. Stakeholders’ key priorities include: (i)
support to agriculture, including drought resistant wheat seeds; (ii) health reforms; and (iii) remedying the
lack of attention to local concerns by the central government. The Bank discussed the comparative
advantage of the Bank in agriculture and put the focus on the agriculture ESW that is planned for FY15
rather than direct financial support to agriculture. The discussion also focused on sovereign versus
sub-sovereign lending and the fact that Iraq’s Governorates do not meet the minimum criteria for
sub-sovereign lending. It was agreed that the Governorate would raise their needs for financial support to
these sectors to the level of the Ministry of Finance.
8.
During these consultations, the Bank team discussed the proposed pillars of support, focusing on
key priorities such as (i) strengthening Iraq’s economic management and fiduciary capacity; (ii) supporting
private sector-led economic diversification and employment generation; and (iii) strengthening capacity to
improve large-scale public service delivery. The Bank also discussed modalities of support with key
government officials, including the balance of lending and non-lending, i.e., analytical work, technical
assistance, and capacity building.
9.
A consultation with the International Partners Forum was held on this CPS. All donors consulted
on the draft CPS confirmed that the Bank Group’s proposed strategy is the right one and is broadly in line
with their own strategy. There are working groups with donors on PFM, governance, water and
agriculture, and partners meet on a regular basis and support each other's efforts in Iraq.
Summary of Key Issues Discussed:
10.
Iraq is a large oil-based economy with strong upside potential, but has extremely weak institutional
capacity. All stakeholders stressed the erosion of skills following years of war and the need for reforms
and continued capacity building in all sectors. Although security remains a problem, the economy is
picking up as evidenced by strong macroeconomic indicators, increasing export capacity, new oil
contracts, and a construction boom. As such, the country is benefitting from an increase in oil production,
exports and oil prices. These, however, do not translate to job creation or improvements in the delivery of
basic services, and the distribution of wealth and opportunity remains unequal.
11.
Government officials broadly indicated that Iraq did not wish to borrow at high levels given their
abundant resources. The Government also made clear that the priority for work with the World Bank is less
about access to financial resources but mainly about the need to increase its own absorptive capacity which

38

has been severely degraded over the past two decades. Discussions with local level government
representatives and civil society groups confirmed this view and stressed the need to accelerate the
delivery of priority services, promote private sector development in non-oil sectors, and ensure inclusion.
12.
Against this background, the discussions with stakeholders evolved around the three pillars of the
CPS and the key messages are as follows:
•

Economic Management and Governance: All stakeholders echoed the need to combat
corruption, establish transparency and build the foundation for long-term sustainable growth.
There was a consensus among stakeholders on the urgent need for legal and regulatory reforms, a
strong and stable financial sector, a robust governance framework, including a good procurement
system, and strong auditing and oversight functions. Members of the Government as well as
donors highlighted the urgent need for better governance in the financial sector, particularly
moving forward on the reform of the two state-owned banks, Al-Rafidain and Al-Rasheed.

•

Job Creation and Inclusive Growth: Discussions centered on the critical need for economic
diversification away from oil, creating the enabling environment for private sector development
and job creation, moving from a central economy to a market economy. Employment, especially
for youth and women, is considered one of the major concerns of stakeholders at all levels. Senior
officials recognized that the large and fast-growing labor force and the absence of a dynamic
private sector constitute serious impediments to addressing the critical issue of employment in
Iraq. Many stakeholders went so far as to note that Iraq’s medium-term political and social
stability will depend on how the issues of jobs and inclusion will be addressed. Some members of
Government noted that Iraq is already working on developing upstream industries such as cement
and petrochemicals, and is also looking at developing the agriculture sector, both to increase food
security and to create rural employment. The World Bank responded that agriculture needed more
analysis since it is not clear the extent to which it will generate employment and that it would
require an integrated approach to water resources and land management, irrigation technology,
financing and marketing and private sector participation. The Bank team recommended bringing in
lessons of experience from other countries in this regard. The World Bank also noted Iraq’s
tourism potential as a possibility for creating jobs which could be explored as part of the analytical
work under the CPS.

•

Basic Services Delivery of Economic and Social Infrastructure: Stakeholders consulted
emphasized that in order to improve the quality of life of Iraqis, the Government needs to urgently
deliver basic services in the sectors of electricity, water, transport, education, primary health, and
social protection while strengthening the capacity of Government institutions to adequately
manage these sectors. As some donors and bilateral partners are in the process of phasing-out of
Iraq, stakeholders requested World Bank support by identifying agents of change or champions in
the Government to ensure that basic services are delivered.

Annex 5: Iraq’s Progress towards the MDGs
1.
Iraq has made progress towards achieving some of the MDGs including reducing hunger,
promoting gender equality and reducing child mortality. However, there is still much work to be done in a
number of crucial areas including increasing participation in primary education, reducing unemployment,
and ensuring access to safe and reliable water and sanitation. The gap in access to essential services
remains wide especially between rural and urban areas. 19
2.
Iraq’s expected outlook to meet the MDGs is as follows (adapted from the World Bank’s “Global
Monitoring Report 2011: Improving the odds of Achieving the MDGs” and the booklet “The MDGs in
Iraq” published by the UN Country Team for Iraq):

Goal
1: Eradicate
extreme poverty
and hunger

2: Achieve
universal
primary
education
3: Promote
gender equality
and empower
women

4: Reduce child
mortality

5: Improve
maternal health

6: Combat
HIV/AIDS,
malaria and
other diseases

19

Iraq’s expected outlook to meet the MDGs
Status
Far from target. The Government of Iraq is targeting a reduction in poverty levels
to 16 percent by 2015 as part of its commitment to eradicate extreme poverty and
hunger under MDG 1. Almost seven million Iraqis live in poverty (spending less
than IQD77,000 per person per month, or US$2.20 per day), totaling 23 percent of
the population.
Close to target. Following the drop in the net primary school enrolment ratio from
91 percent in 1990 to 89 percent in 2007, Iraq faces considerable challenges in its
efforts to meet the 2015 target of 100 percent net primary enrolment.
Far from target. Iraq remains generally on course for achieving gender parity in
primary education enrolment. However, the lowest enrolment rates are to be found
among girls in rural areas. Women’s share of wage employment outside agriculture
fell from 11 percent to 7 percent between 1990 and 2008. Just 13 percent of Iraqi
women participate in the labor force and 24 percent are illiterate. Iraq is targeting a
50 percent share of non-agricultural waged work for women by 2015.
Far from target. Iraq has made considerable progress in reducing mortality rates
among infants and children under the age of five. The proportion of children dying
before reaching the age of five has fallen from 62 to 41 for every 1,000 live births.
Moreover, growing numbers of Iraqi children suffer from stunting (25%) 0-5 years.
However, some central governorates – particularly Salah al-Din (70 per 1,000 live
births) are significantly worse off than the rest of Iraq. Of the countries in the
region, only Yemen has a higher infant mortality rate. Iraq is aiming to reduce its
infant mortality rate to 17 for every 1,000 live births by 2015.
Far from target. The proportion of women dying in child birth (maternal mortality
ratio) currently stands at 84 per 100,000 live births, placing Iraq in a group of 68
countries globally which account for 97 percent of all maternal and child deaths.
Iraq is struggling to reduce the number of women dying in child birth (maternal
mortality) to meet the target of 29 for every 100,000 live births.
Close to target. The prevalence of HIV in Iraq is currently less than 0.1 percent of
the population. New incidences of tuberculosis (TB) rose from 2 to 12 for every
100,000 Iraqis per year between 2000 and 2006, pushing the country further away
from the target of eradication by 2015. Southern and central governorates –
particularly Qadissiya– experience the highest rates. Malaria is now almost

completely eliminated in Iraq with no indigenous cases reported in 2009 compared
to over 39,000 cases in 1995.
Far from target. The proportion of households using an improved water source has
remained at around 80 percent since 1990. In rural areas, this figure is just 57
percent. Iraq faces considerable challenges in sanitation. 84 percent of the
population uses an improved sanitation facility, like the public sewerage network or
a septic tank. However, just 26 percent of the population is covered by the public
sewage network, dropping to 2 percent in rural areas. While Iraq may meet the
target of 96 percent of households using an improved sanitation facility, issues still
remain over the lack of consistent water supplies, contamination of the water
network due to damaged infrastructure and lack of wastewater treatment. An
alarming 83 percent of Iraq’s wastewater is left untreated, contributing to the
pollution of Iraq’s waterways and general environment
Close to target. Use of new technology has increased rapidly in Iraq since 2003,
with 78% of the population using a mobile telephone as of 2007. Personal computer
ownership has risen to 12% while only 6% of Iraqis use the internet daily.
