EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Following a period of political stabilization and economic recovery, Papua New Guinea
(PNG) has emerged from the climate of uncertainty that precipitated the 2005 Interim Strategy
Note (ISN). Positive developments include the passage o f legislation to strengthen continuity in
government, record-high prices for the country’s export commodities, sound macroeconomic
policies, improved fiscal discipline, and a more positive aid environment. Though the Bank
Group and Government o f Papua New Guinea (GoPNG) have faced difficulties in the past, the
relationship has improved and both parties are committed to working together and with other
development partners to achieve the country’s development objectives, as expressed in the
Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) for 2005-20 10 and the national Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).

ii.
Despite these achievements, important challenges remain in fostering inclusive,
sustainable development in PNG. Though the economy has grown in recent years, this growth
has been concentrated in the formal sector with little impact on the lives o f poor people, most o f
whom live in rural areas and depend on agriculture and informal activities for their livelihoods.
I t i s estimated that more people are living in poverty now than a decade ago, and the creation of
jobs and other income-earning opportunities i s not keeping up with the needs o f a growing
population. Women and young people are particularly disadvantaged by unequal access to jobs
and services. The availability and quality o f basic infrastructure and social services have
declined, holding back business growth and human development outcomes. The rapid spread o f
HIVIAIDS poses a serious threat to future productivity unless the epidemic i s brought under
control through decisive, coordinated action. Yet systems for distributing resources and
coordinating across levels o f government are weak, and political leaders face incentives to place
the interests o f their local group above those o f the nation as a whole. Within the country’s rich
cultural diversity, there i s a potential for social fragmentation and exclusion, and a lack o f
security in some areas o f the country deters private investment and freedom o f movement.
iii.

The World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) seeks to address these
challenges through a long-term partnership with the government, people, and development
partners of Papua New Guinea. The CAS for 2008-2011 i s designed as the first in a series
covering the next 15 to 20 years, which w i l l allow the Bank Group and GoPNG to take action on
challenges that can be addressed in the short term, while starting to work on issues that require a
long-term approach. In an effort to support country ownership, the CAS i s aligned to the
Government’s MTDS, which seeks to alleviate poverty through economic growth and social
development. The CAS emphasizes close coordination with development partners, including
programmatic support in specific sectors, to maximize aid effectiveness within each donor’s
comparative advantage and available resources. Partnerships with civil society and the private
sector w i l l also be strengthened to enhance program relevance and sustainability. The strategy i s
a results-based CAS, defining expected outcomes over the next four years as well as the Bank
Group’s proposed contribution to longer-term national development goals.
The CAS has been prepared jointly by the World Bank and Znternational Finance
iv.
Corporation (IFC). The first joint strategy for PNG, this CAS recognizes the critical importance
o f private sector development in PNG and the substantial scope for collaboration on this agenda.
The Bank and IFC w i l l work to integrate their country programs, from upstream analysis to
complementary investment and advisory activities in areas such as forestry, fisheries, extractive
industries development, agriculture, infrastructure, and the overall business environment.
i

Executive Summary

11

The overarching goal of the CAS is to support poverty reduction in PNG. The Bank
v.
)
and maintaining sound
Group w i l l focus i t s interventions on two strategic pillars: (IPromoting
economic and natural resource management, and (11) Improving livelihoods and service delivery,
especially for the rural poor. This dual focus w i l l allow the CAS to support continued growth
under the current natural resource-based economy, while putting in place the conditions for a
activities w i l l focus on
more diversified, sustainable growth path in the future. Within Pillar I,
strengthening governance, maintaining sound management o f the extractive industries, and
Iw i l l include
promoting effective and sustainable management o f natural resources. Pillar I
targeted interventions to support private sector development, enhance rural livelihoods, improve
local service delivery, expand access to infrastructure, and support multi-donor approaches in
health and education. Efforts to improve governance and empower women and youth w i l l be
mainstreamed across both pillars. The CAS i s designed to be delivered on two platforms,
supporting policy and institutional development at the national level while working to improve
planning and service delivery at the local level. The Bank Group’s engagement in PNG w i l l be
guided by the principles o f long-term partnership, Government leadership, country ownership,
results focus, and openness and transparency.

vi.
The CAS aims to leverage the Bank Group’s modest financial resources for PNG by
supplementing a focused country program with regional and global resources. The annual IDA
allocation i s tentatively estimated at U S $ 45 million for FY08 and US$ 30-32 million thereafter,
depending on PNG’s performance relative to other IDA borrowers. Given these resource
limitations, the CAS aims to restrict new IDA operations to a maximum o f three in a typical
year; “core” analytical pieces w i l l be limited to two per year. Country program interventions
w i l l focus on areas where the Bank Group has performed well in the past or where i t can draw on
global knowledge and experience to complement the work o f other development partners. In
addition, the CAS w i l l draw upon regional and global funds such as the Global Environment
Facility, Infrastructure for Growth Facility, and Forest Carbon Partnership Facility.
vii.
The program presented in Table 6 (page 28) is ambitious in relation to the Bank Group’s
budgetary and lending resources. I t should be understood more as a menu o f valid assistance
activities than a literal roadmap, and w i l l allow flexibility to focus on issues and areas where
Bank Group assistance appears to hold the most promise. Each year a formal CAS progress
review and programming meeting w i l l be held with GoPNG, with a view to solidifying the
coming year’s lending and AAA.
viii.
The lending program for FY08 includes three I D A credits: the Second Mining
Development TA, the Smallholder Agriculture Development Project, and a Rural Electrification
Project. Thereafter, depending on country conditions, Government preferences, emerging
opportunities, and available resources, possible areas o f IDA support may include provincial
reconstruction and development, rural telecommunications, oversight and accountability
institutions, district service delivery and local governance, rural development and livelihoods,
road maintenance and rehabilitation, youth integration, and programmatic support to the health
and education sectors. In addition, regional and global resources may be called upon to provide
assistance on climate change mitigation and adaptation, and avoided deforestation. In addition to
supporting microfinance, the IFC w i l l consider investing in gas field development, mining,
telecommunications, agribusiness, financial markets, and renewable energy.

iii

Executive Summary

ix.
The Bank Group’s non-lending program will consist of advisory assistance in support of
MTDS objectives, as well as analytical work to examine development challenges and underpin
the design of lending activities. The CAS w i l l support continued and strengthened dialogue on
public expenditure and procurement reforms under the multi-donor Public Expenditure Review
and Rationalization process. In addition, core analytical work may include assessments o f the
state o f the economy and policy-based work on public finances, national infrastructure, and local
service delivery models; strategies for youth integration and for rural growth and livelihoods
development; and the strengthening o f baseline data on poverty and public expenditure flows.
Other analytical activities could include work on natural resource management and
environmental issues, supporting the Fast Track Initiative for basic education, and a national biobehavioral HIV/AIDS survey. IFC’s analytical and policy work w i l l focus on strengthening the
business enabling environment, niche industries, and public-private partnerships in
infrastructure. The Bank and IFC are seeking opportunities to collaborate on forestry, fisheries,
gas development, rural telecommunications, and airport and aviation development. The Bank’s
current program o f successful community outreach activities w i l l also be continued.
x.
The eflectiveness of the proposed program and attainment of CAS objectives is subject to
a number of risks. Political conflict could lead to a deterioration in the governance environment,
and a steep drop in commodity prices would likely trigger a rapid decline in economic
performance. Economic and social disruptions could also arise as a result o f growing
unemployment, especially among youth, or in the event o f a natural disaster. The risks to
program implementation include a lack o f ownership o f reform, weaknesses in public fiduciary
systems, ineffective donor coordination, and an insufficiently large-scale or long-term
engagement on the part o f the Bank Group to achieve traction on difficult development issues.
The CAS i s designed to mitigate these risks to the extent possible, taking a long-term approach
to governance and j o b creation while working to improve livelihoods and service delivery, and
build constituencies for change.
xi,

The following issues are proposed for Board discussion:
0

Does the proposed CAS adequately address Papua New Guinea’s unique circumstances
and provide a sound basis for rebuilding the Bank-country relationship after the
difficulties o f recent years?

0

I s the proposed two-pillared, two-platform strategic approach appropriate?

0

I s the m i x o f instruments and activities consistent with the strategic approach and feasible
within the resource envelope?

I.INTRODUCTION
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) describes the World Bank Group’s proposed
program in Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the four-year period 2008-2011. I t i s the first full
CAS for PNG since 1999, and the first to be prepared jointly b y the Bank and the International
Finance Corporation (FC). In the early part of this decade, a combination o f factors including
political instability, economic and fiscal decline, and differences o f opinion between the Bank
and the Government o f Papua New Guinea (GoPNG), led the Bank in 2005 to prepare an Interim
Strategy Note (ISN). Positive developments now warrant the preparation o f a full CAS. First,
legislative reforms have improved continuity in government, with the last Government serving a
full five-year term for the first time in PNG’s history. Second, economic decline has been
reversed through a combination o f high global commodity prices, sound macroeconomic
policies, and improved fiscal discipline. Third, the relationship between the Bank Group and the
Government has improved due to persistent efforts b y both parties to find areas o f consensus and
productive cooperation. In addition, the international assistance environment i s now more
positive: GoPNG has produced a credible Medium Term Development Strategy (MTDS) for
2005 to 2010, and all key development partners have committed themselves to aligning their
programs behind it.
2.
The World Bank Group is committed to launching a long-term partnership with PNG.
The CAS for 2008-2011 i s envisioned as the first in a series that w i l l cover the next 15 to 20
years. A long-term perspective allows the current CAS to better distinguish the outcomes that
can be achieved in four years, and those complex, vital issues that require a long-term
involvement and greater patience (such as central-provincial relations, and transparency and
accountability in government).

3.
The CAS demonstrates the Bank Group’s intention to align its programs with the
Government’s MTDS. The M T D S seeks to alleviate poverty through sound economic and
natural resource management and through the direct delivery o f services to the poor. Given
IDA’Srelatively modest resource envelope for PNG, the CAS places emphasis on working with
other donor partners and using the Bank’s global experience and skills to leverage the policy and
programmatic outcomes articulated in the MTDS. In preparing the CAS, the Bank Group has
paid careful attention to building trust with GoPNG, and partnership with citizens and other
development partners at both national and local levels.

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT
4.
Papua New Guinea enjoys substantial natural wealth and has recently experienced an
economic recovery, but the fruits of growth have not led to poverty reduction. PNG’s economy
i s highly dualistic, consisting o f an enclave-based formal sector focused mainly on the largescale export o f natural resources, and an informal sector dominated b y the subsistence and semisubsistence activities o f the majority rural population. Recent growth i s the result o f improved
performance in the formal economy, and has so far had little impact on the livelihoods o f the
rural poor. Basic services and infrastructure have deteriorated, moreover, while formal systems
for distributing public resources and implementing public service programs remain weak and
susceptible to political capture. PNG’s rich cultural diversity embodies a potential for
fragmentation, and pervasive insecurity in some areas acts as a severe deterrent to private
investment.

Country Context

2

5.
The country’s main development challenge i s to ensure that i t s natural wealth i s exploited
responsibly, and that the revenues derived from i t are used responsibly and efficiently to improve
service delivery and, above all, to create the foundations for employment and broad-based
growth.
A. Sociopolitical Landscape
6.
National political institutions and processes are beginning to stabilize after decades of
volatility and uncertainty. Legislation passed in 2001 restricts post-election changes in party
allegiance, which has helped strengthen political continuity. In 2007, parliamentary elections
were conducted successfully under the new limited preferential voting system, in which
candidates need to attract a greater percentage o f votes to be elected. The Government o f Prime
Minister Michael Somare was the first since independence in 1975 to serve a full five-year term
and was re-elected in 2007. I t is, however, early to tell whether this stability w i l l result in greater
predictability, efficiency, and accountability in national politics.
7.
Concepts of national identity, legitimacy, and authority are rooted in the country’s
distinct social and cultural fabric, with profound implications for politics, governance, and the
distribution of economic benefits across the country. PNG i s home to a highly diverse
population, organized in small, fragmented social groups and speaking over 800 distinct
languages. Unlike many countries in which independence struggles served to forge a national
identity, PNG has experienced no such galvanizing event, and most people today see themselves
primarily as members o f local, clan-based groups rather than as citizens o f Papua New Guinea.
This perspective i s reflected in a style o f national politics in which political leaders tend to focus
on securing benefits for their local allegiance groups, regarding national considerations as
secondary in importance. This clearly complicates the pursuit o f a clear national vision and o f
policies and practices supporting the same.
8.
Internal stability has improved with peace in Bougainville, but law and order is a serious
national issue. Following a nine-year secessionist conflict, the Bougainville Peace Agreement
was signed in August 2001, and elections for the first Autonomous Bougainville Government
(ABG) were conducted successfully in 2005. The ABG has since focused on developing the
capacity to take over administrative functions from the National Government and to generate
internal revenues from agriculture and mining. Despite peace in Bougainville, internal stability
remains a concern in some areas (e.g. Port Moresby, Lae, Southern Highlands). The causes o f
this vary-in Port Moresby, urban drift and unemployment have led to crime that the police have
failed to keep in check; in the Southern Highlands, tribal fighting and lawlessness have been
sparked b y conflict over o i l and gas reserves. A reputation for insecurity has damaged PNG’s
potential as a tourist destination and a home for investment.
9.
External relations are relatively stable. Papua New Guinea’s relationship with Australia
i s an important determinant o f i t s foreign policy and security arrangements. While Australia i s
b y far PNG’s most significant trading partner, bilateral political relations are complex. At the
same time, PNG i s pursuing expanded trade links with East Asia. As a member o f the Asian
Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, and the largest developing country member o f the Pacific
Islands Forum, PNG has the potential to explore growing regional markets.

result o f higher fuel prices, foreign
exchange reserve accumulation,
and
expanding private sector credit.’ Interest rates remain low at just over 3 percent. The kina has
strengthened against the US dollar, appreciating b y 6 percent on a real effective basis in 2006.

11.
High international prices for key export commodities have created signijkant surpluses
on the external account. PNG has one o f the least restrictive trade regimes in the region,
following a program o f tariff reductions and the abolition o f exclusive agricultural commodity
export arrangements. Despite the continued expansion o f imports, the merchandise trade surplus
widened to nearly U S $ 1.5 billion in 2006 as exports o f both mineral and non-mineral goods
grew to US$4.3 billion. The current account surplus expanded from 3.9 percent o f GDP in 2005
to 5.3 percent in 2006, but i s expected to narrow in the medium term as commodity prices soften.
International reserves have continued to accumulate on a net basis, rising to about US$ 1.9
billion in 2006 (the equivalent o f about 8 months o f non-mineral merchandise imports). Given
the PNG economy’s vulnerability to shifts in international commodity prices, i t i s prudent to
maintain a higher level o f foreign exchange reserves than in many other countries.
12.
I n 2007, the Government is expected to maintain an overall fiscal surplus for the third
consecutive year, but the non-mineral deficit is increasing. The expected rise in non-mineral
fiscal imbalances, from 4.7 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 8.2 percent in 2007, reflects growth in
development spending financed by the record inflow of mineral revenues. These windfall
revenues, combined with improved expenditure controls and lower domestic interest rates, have
driven recent budget surpluses. The Government has utilized this surplus well, reducing a
backlog o f domestic payments arrears to suppliers, scaling back future liabilities b y funding the
public sector pension plan, and restructuring domestic debt. Total public sector debt fell from 67
percent o f GDP in 2003 to an estimated 39 percent in 2006, and public and publicly-guaranteed

Inflation projections fall within the Bank of Papua New Guinea’s target range of 2.5-4.5 percent over the medium
term.

external debt declined from 46 percent of GDP to about 21 percent over the same period. In
addition, the Government has boosted budget allocations in line with MTDS priorities, focusing
on needed infrastructure rehabilitation and one-off development projects (in recognition o f the
unpredictable nature o f these inflows). This reorientation of Government expenditures i s sound,
but the desired results w i l l require the creation o f adequate operating capacity and consistent
allocation o f recurrent funds for implementation and maintenance.

C. Natural Resource Management
13.
As in many other resource-rich nations, PNG remains highly dependent on the extractive
industries. PNG i s endowed with substantial deposits of minerals (mainly gold and copper), oil,
and gas. Minerals and petroleum alone account for over 20 percent o f GDP and nearly 80
percent o f exports, and this trend i s likely to continue in the near to medium tern. Once
considered a sector in decline, the mining industry in PNG has experienced a resurgence in
exploration and investment in response to rising mineral prices, improvements in the availability
o f geological data, and tax adjustments enhancing PNG’s competitiveness. New mineral
exploration and investment w i l l be critical in the years ahead since the country w i l l likely face
the closure o f the O k Tedi mine, i t s biggest mining operation, as early as 2013. The export o f o i l
has also contributed significantly to PNG’s economy, though i t i s expected that current oil fields
w i l l be largely depleted b y 2015. Recoverable natural gas resources are estimated to be
substantial, and are likely to be an important source o f economic growth and commercial
development in the years ahead. (See Attachment A for a review o f the extractive industries in
PNG.)
14.
Papua New Guinea’s rich environmental resources ofSer the potential to support rural
livelihoods and tourism development. PNG i s home to one o f the world’s four remaining
significant tropical rainforests, covering over three-quarters o f the country’s total land area.
Fisheries resources are large and relatively unexploited compared to other parts o f East Asia and
the Pacific, and artisanal and small-scale mining provides substantial income to rural families.
Land constitutes a livelihoods safety net for the vast majority o f Papua New Guineans. The
country’s rugged physical beauty, rich biodiversity, and diverse cultural landscape also hold
great untapped tourism potential.

15.

Yet PNG’s natural resources - and their role in economic growth - remain vulnerable to
institutional and management weaknesses, unsustainable practices, and natural disasters. The
policy and legal framework for natural resource management i s unclear and incomplete.
Management agencies are under-resourced, and the data needed for effective planning and
decision making are absent. Shortcomings in governance and accountability have led to
overexploitation o f resources and environmental pollution. PNG i s also highly susceptible to
natural disasters, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Global climate
change has increased the occurrence o f extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods,
threatening the food security and economic base o f rural populations. GoPNG has launched a
number o f initiatives aimed at mitigating environmental degradation and natural disastersincluding the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7 Initiative on forestry and energy, and
work on the Clean Development Mechanism for emissions trading under the Kyoto Protocolbut they are only at an embryonic stage.

Public financial management in PNG is based on a sound legislative and procedural
framework, but weaknesses in implementation undermine accountability and budget credibility.
A 2005 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment found that PNG has
established adequate systems and processes for public financial management, but that they are
not always followed and that breaches o f procedure are not effectively penalized. A lack o f
transparency in budget execution makes i t difficult to track expenditures. Considerable diversion
o f budgeted resources and reliance on non-transparent extra-budgetary trust funds often translate
into insufficient resources and staff for important services. Conversely, the Government’s ability
to direct resources to priority areas i s constrained b y weak integration between development and
recurrent budgets together with compression o f recurrent spending, resulting in insufficient
recurrent funds to deliver services and development budget programs. The alignment o f the
budget with broad M T D S priorities has improved in recent years, but there i s a continued need to
develop specific, costed priorities so as to strengthen links between national and sector strategies,
available resources, and budget planning.
17.
Procurement processes have improved considerably on paper, but improvements in
practice will depend on strong leadership, capacity building, and the consistent use of
standardized documentation and procedures. In 2006, a Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) concluded that the legal and regulatory framework for public procurement
improved substantially following amendments to the Public Financial Management Act in 2003,
but that waivers o f competitive processes remain widespread. This lack o f transparency
contributes to perceptions o f corruption in procurement. Use of the appropriate manuals i s
constrained by insufficient dissemination and training, while standard bidding documents
consistent with the amended legislation need to be developed, and clear tender evaluation
processes introduced.
18.
Flaws in the decentralization framework further impede service delivery and
accountability. The system o f fiscal transfers to the provinces has never worked well, and grants
mandated under the 1995 Organic Law on Provincial and Local-Level Governments have not
been fully implemented as intended. Though local-level governments are formally responsible
for critical services (such as the construction and maintenance o f schools, health posts, and
housing for teachers and health workers), they have little real control over their budgets and thus
little accountability for delivering services. Planning and budgeting practices are not well
aligned, and communication between levels o f government, and between government and nonstate actors, i s poor. In practice, local government budgets are largely influenced by Members o f
Parliament, who are strongly motivated to favor constituents in their own clan or ethnic group,
and who have effective control over significant local-level funds using District Support Grants.
Highly unequal access to resources relative to needs across provinces exacerbates this situation.2
19.
Controlling corruption should be a much higher priority in PNG. Corruption i s widely
acknowledged to be a serious issue at a l l levels of government, and particularly in the areas o f

Valuable research b y the National Economic and Fiscal Commission has demonstrated that only five provinces
have sufficient resources to carry out their basic responsibilities for service delivery and infrastructure maintenance,
and four o f those five have access to large royalty transfers that are not available to other provinces.

budget management, procurement, and natural resource management. In 2007, Papua New
Guinea ranked 162”d out of 179 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions
Index, as compared to 118th out o f 133 countries in 2003,3 and there i s evidence that control of
corruption has worsened over the last decade (Figure 2). The causes o f corruption in PNG
include insufficient capacity among oversight, audit, and enforcement agencies; a lack of
transparency and rule respect in the use o f public funds and natural resources; politicization o f
bureaucratic processes; and the redirection o f public resources to meet personal or social
demands, such as wantok obligation^.^ In the MTDS, GoPNG has highlighted the costs o f
corruption in terms o f economic growth, private investment, and service delivery. Royalties and
revenues from mineral resources are managed in a non-transparent way, and although substantial
funds are distributed to provincial governments and to landowner representatives as
compensation for use o f communal lands, studies undertaken by the Department o f Mines
indicate that they are often not transparently used or equitably shared and rarely result in
sustainable investments or other public gains. GoPNG has expressed interest in participating in
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which encourages independent
verification and full publication o f company payments and government receipts from oil, gas,
and mining activities. The M T D S also aims to support oversight institutions and “watchdog”
bodies in order to improve efforts to detect and prosecute fraud and corruption, and GoPNG i s
workmg to develop an anticorruption strategy.

PNG has established a full range of formal accountability institutions, but they need
signifcant strengthening to become truly effective. The Ombudsman Commission plays a key
role in enforcing the Leadership Code and investigating citizen complaints o f administrative
malpractice, and the Auditor General i s making strong efforts to erase the backlog o f audits of
public accounts. Both institutions, however, are hampered b y a lack o f budget and qualified staff

with specialized skills, and delays occur in tabling their reports to Parliament. Parliamentary
scrutiny o f the budget i s limited, with few days devoted to budget review and few changes made
to budget proposals. The Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee has been reinstated after a
four-year hiatus, and i t i s hoped that follow-up on the Auditor General’s recommendations w i l l
improve as a result. The judiciary functions reasonably well and independently at the national
level, but i t s independence i s reportedly under pressure and i t lacks adequate resources and skills.
The police force i s widely criticized for corruption and human rights abusesa5 I t also lacks
professional staff and funds for operations, and as a result criminal activity has escalated with
few constraints, spreading from urban to some rural areas. PNG’s law and order problem makes
i t difficult to protect women and children from violence and rape, disrupts orderly economic
activity, deters private investment, and greatly increases the costs o f doing business.6
21.
There is, however, a significant and growing demand for good governance in PNG. The
media are well developed and lively, freely reporting on governance issues and allegations o f
corruption in the public sector. Several impressive policy and research institutions contribute to
the governance debate, and various international and national NGOs are active in promoting
awareness and demand for good governance. Nonetheless, there i s considerable room to build
consensus among local-level governments, civil society, and other actors, creating communities
o f interest that share in the pursuit o f good governance and i t s translation into better service
delivery at the local level. GoPNG has recently made important progress in strengthening
consultations with the private sector and civil society around the preparation of the budget, but
budget information i s s t i l l too limited, and largely inaccessible at the community level.

E. Poverty, Livelihoods, and Service Delivery
22.
Zn Papua New Guinea, poverty is defined as a lack of access. Importantly, this includes
the inability to take advantage o f basic public services and infrastructure, as well as a lack o f
access to income and income-earning opportunities. Viewing poverty through this lens offers
valuable insights into the design of effective poverty alleviation programs in PNG.
23.

As noted, recent improvements in economic performance have not had a tangible impact
on poverty. Although the information from the 1996 National Household Survey i s in urgent
need o f updating, poverty today can be estimated b y combining the 1996 survey data with
information on the rate and sectoral pattern o f output and employment growth since then. The
Bank estimates that the incidence o f poverty has risen sharply in the last decade. In 2006, an
estimated 39 percent o f Papua New Guineans lived on less than U S $ 1 per day (using 1993
Purchasing Power Parity), up from 25 percent in 1996. I t i s likewise estimated that over half the
population now lives below the national poverty line, rising from 37 percent in 1996 to 53
percent in 2006.7 This increase was concentrated in the period o f economic contraction between

In 2004, i t was estimated that costs associated with security and theft amounted to 12-15 percent of business

1996 and 2002, with recent economic recovery helping to halt the rising trend. However, our
estimates do not suggest any significant decline in poverty since 2003, reflecting a limited
growth in real per capita incomes. In comparative terms, PNG’s per capita income (Atlas
method) o f about US$770 in 2006 only slightly exceeds the low-income country average o f U S $
650, and i s well below the East Asia and Pacific Region’s (EAP) average o f US$ 1,863.
Poverty is an overwhelmingly rural phenomenon. In 1996, two in five rural residents
24.
were poor, compared to one in six in urban areas. About 93 percent o f the poor lived in rural
areas. Since then, the incidence o f both rural and urban poverty i s estimated to have increased,
with urban poverty growing faster. But even today, the share o f rural poverty i s estimated to be
around 85 percent. Income disparities between urban and rural areas, and among regions, remain
high, and nearly all socio-economic indicators are significantly worse in rural areas than in the
cities. Inequality i s also high overall. In 1996, the poorest 20 percent o f the population
accounted for only 4.5 percent o f total consumption, while the richest 20 percent accounted for
over 56 percent, giving PNG a Gini coefficient o f 0.48 and making i t the country with the most
unequal distribution o f consumption in the EAP region,* Inequality i s related to the remoteness
and isolation o f the poorest rural areas, which tend to lack access to markets, services, and
income-generating opportunities, and where returns on agriculture are often reduced b y low soil
fertility, difficult terrain, and higher vulnerability to pests or climatic events.

25.
Poverty rates are lowest among the few households who participate in the formal
business sector or hold wage-earning jobs. Only about 6 percent o f the working-age population
in PNG i s employed in the formal sector (2002).9 In urban areas, unemployment and
underemployment are high and likely growing, as formal sector employment in the National
Capital District declined b y approximately 6 percent between 1996 and 2005. There are
indications o f an encouraging revival o f growth in formal sector employment during 2006 (by
about 7 percent on a third quarter year-on-year basis), but with the population growing at an
estimated 2.7 percent per year the j o b creation challenge i s enormous, and particularly critical
because o f the associations between youth, unemployment, and lawlessness. The population o f
about 6.2 million people i s set to double in 25 years or so, making j o b creation the Government’s
top strategic and political priority.
26.

Agriculture, fishing, community forestry, and artisanal and small-scale mining are
important sources of subsistence and cash income in rural areas. Nearly two-thirds o f poor
people (62 percent in 1996) live in a household where agriculture i s the principal source o f cash
income for the household head. Subsistence agriculture i s also important, and though most

households that grow food for consumption sell a portion o f their food crops at market, these
transactions are usually small and opportunistic in nature. A large number o f people, estimated
at somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000, participate in coastal subsistence fisheries, and a
s i m i l a r number benefit from artisanal and small-scale mining activities. In addition, forests play

The Gini coefficient i s a measure of inequality, ranging from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality). By
comparison, the Gini coefficients for other EAP countries are: Cambodia 0.42 (2004), China 0.46 (2002), Indonesia
0.35 (2006), Laos 0.35 (2002), Philippines 0.45 (2003), Thailand 0.43 (2004), and Vietnam 0.38 (2002). These
inequality indices do not take account of spatial price differences within countries.

an important role in the livelihoods and cultural lives of many o f PNG's rural residents. Further
development o f these income-earning opportunities faces important challenges, including limited
and expensive access to inputs and markets, poor infrastructure, ineffective extension services,
limited access to credit, corruption, safety and security concerns, and insufficient awareness or
mitigation of environmental impacts.
27.
The creation of income-earning opportunities through micro, small, and medium
enterprise development is constrained by a dificult investment environment. Accordin to the
2008 Doing Business indicators compiled by the World Bank and IFC, PNG ranks 84ti? out o f
178 economies for overall ease o f doing business. Rankings are substantially lower, however,
for dealing with licenses, getting credit, and enforcing contracts." Cumbersome administrative
processes and limited access to finance hamper the formation and growth o f small businesses. A
lack o f financial market competition and underdeveloped financial infrastructure compound this
problem b y increasing the cost o f finance and raising the risk o f becoming trapped in debt.
Many o f the thousands o f micro, small, and medium enterprises that are in operation are in the
informal sector, and the absence o f effective business services holds back productivity. Business
development i s also discouraged by the deterioration o f public infrastructure and the breakdown
o f law and order.
28.
The condition of physical infrastructure has deteriorated, with far-reaching
consequences for the livelihoods of poor people. Transport networks are in poor condition,
limiting access to markets and social services, and imposing high costs on businesses. About 85
percent o f the main roads and nearly all feeder roads are impassable during at least part o f the
year. Though reliable statistics are difficult to obtain, i t i s estimated that 17 percent o f the
population has no road access. Shipping and air transport services to isolated communities are in
decline, and wharves and airstrips are falling into disrepair." Only 7 percent o f the population
has access to electricity, with wide variations across regions, holding back enterprise formation,
service quality, and the efficiency o f local adrninistration.l2 Access to information and
telecommunications i s among the lowest in the w0r1d.l~
There is an emerging consensus that human development outcomes and social service
29.
delivery performance have declined in recent years. PNG ranks 139' out o f 177 countries in the
latest United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Index (2004),
falling from 12Efh out o f 175 countries in 1994. Overall, PNG's human development indicators
lag behind other EAP and low-income countries (Table 1). Performance in the health and
education sectors i s constrained by a lack o f clarity in the decentralization framework, a squeeze
on recurrent spending, and inefficiencies in resource allocation; the consequence has been
shortages o f funding and qualified staff on the frontlines o f service delivery.

ports serving Port Moresby, Lae, Madang, Kimbe, and Rabaul carry international and coastal traffic and have
reasonable infrastructure, but lesser ports provide only basic services and are often unusable in bad weather. The
deteriorating condition o f runways at major and secondary airports often causes services to be diverted or cancelled.
12
Nearly two-fifths of healthhub-health centers and an even greater proportion o f rural health posts have no
electricity to power essential medical equipment, and among the small minority o f schools that have access to
electricity, energy costs account for as much as 70 percent o f their budget.
l3Fewer than 3 in 100 Papua New Guineans have access to basic telecommunications. Fixed-line infrastructure
reaches only 80 population centers, and mobile service i s limited. Internet access i s primarily limited to the capital,

Health outcomes have declined in the last decade, and Papua New Guinea is facing the

rural population. In 2007, the GoPNG released a report estimating that 1.28 percent o f the
population i s living with HIV/AIDS. Without effective interventions, the epidemic could
significantly increase. Though GoPNG has taken steps to establish an institutional, legal, and
strategic framework for preventing and treating HIV/AIDS, much more needs to be done to
mount an effective national response to the epidemic.

Access to education has improved considerably, but there is a need to strengthen quality,
eficiency, and equity. The number o f students in PNG doubled in the decade following the
national education reform o f 1993. With the school-age population growing at nearly 3 percent
per year, gross primary enrollment rates have remained steady at about 75 percent, well short o f
the goal of universal basic education. Girls account for about 45 percent o f enrollment in the
basic education cycle, but their share drops to 40 percent b y grade 10, and 35 percent b y grades

11 and 12.15 About one in five children do not yet attend school, and most do not complete the
basic cycle. Literacy rates among youths and adults are l o w at 67 and 57 percent respectively.
According to the 2004 Public Expenditure and Service Delivery (PESD) study, school facilities
are in decline and absenteeism i s high (averaging 15 percent among both students and teachers).
32.
Despite some advances, progress toward the MDGs has been disappointing.
Recognizing that the internationally defined MDG targets would remain out of PNG’ s reach well
beyond 2015, GoPNG has endorsed a set o f nationally relevant targets and indicators. The
national MDGs are considerably more modest, but s t i l l present an ambitious agenda for the next
seven years. Progress has generally been slow, and in some areas has stalled or even deteriorated
(Attachment B), while the rapid spread o f HIV/AIDS threatens to reverse many o f the gains
made. The first national MDG progress report, produced jointly b y GoPNG and UN in 2004,
concluded that most o f the national MDGs-with the exception o f those focusing on HIV/AIDS
and the environment-could be achieved on time, but only with concerted efforts to improve
service delivery in low-performing provinces.

F. Social Inclusion
33.
The status of women in society varies widely across the country, but general trends point
to significant gender inequalities. GoPNG has ratified the United Nations Convention on the
Elimination o f Discrimination Against Women and incorporated i t s provisions into national
policies, strategies, and laws. Implementation w i l l be the next challenge. Women have
substantially poorer access to health care services, and lower levels o f educational attainment and
literacy pose significant barriers to their equal participation in economic activity and political
life. Women receive a smaller share o f household income than men and are less likely to
participate in the formal non-agricultural wage economy. Even where women are most
economically active, they exercise little control over the benefits generated b y their activity.
Most women lack access to credit, banking, and markets. Their representation in politics i s
negligible, with only one female among 109 national parliamentarians.
Women are
disproportionately the victims o f violence, and their ability to participate in economic and social
life i s reportedly constrained b y the associated injuries, feelings o f fear, and increased risk o f
contracting HIV/AIDS. The country’s law and justice institutions are dominated b y men, and
women are not always able to access judicial recourse.16
34.
The rapidly growing youth population faces formidable challenges in finding
employment. Nearly half of the population i s under the age o f 20, and the number of young
people i s expected to double in the next 20 years. Youth unemployment and underemployment
are on the rise, and only one in ten school graduates i s likely to find a j o b in the private sector.
Many young people in PNG leave their villages in search o f jobs in cities and towns, only to find
that urban j o b markets are highly competitive and that they lack the skills needed to perform the
few jobs that are available. This situation has fuelled the expansion o f urban youth gangs. As
populations in urban settlements lose their links with their rural areas o f origin, these young
people become more dependent on involvement in gangs as their main source o f livelihood and
social acceptance. Even within their local communities, young people often feel they have

limited opportunities to participate actively in local affairs or express their concerns to decision
makers, and that when they do speak out they are not taken seriously b y their elders.17 This
sense o f disenfranchisement can lead to frustration, apathy, and disengagement from society,
which in turn feeds social conflict and crime. In addition, young people are highly vulnerable to
health risks such as HIV/AIDS and alcohol and substance abuse.

111. PNG’S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, PROSPECTS, AND CHALLENGES

A. Country Priorities and Agenda
35.
Papua New Guinea’s Medium Term Development Strategy for 2005 to 2010 lays out a
vision of the country’s development goals and the Government’s approach to achieving them.
The ultimate aim o f the MTDS i s to foster sustainable improvements in the quality o f life o f all
Papua New Guineans b y promoting economic growth and social development. Drawing from
the Government’s Program for Recovery and Development, announced in 2002, the M T D S
promotes three strategic priorities: good governance, including public sector reform and
enhanced political stability; export-driven economic growth, focusing on sectors in which PNG
has a comparative advantage, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism, supported b y
mining, petroleum, and gas; and rural development, poverty reduction, and empowerment
through human resource development. The strategic approach i s underpinned b y the Medium
Term Resource Framework and the Strategic Plan for Supporting Public Sector Reform,
covering 2003-2007. The M T D S objectives w i l l be reflected in a National Poverty Reduction
Strategy which i s currently under preparation.
The Government’s development strategy prioritizes pro-poor spending. In hopes of
36.
achieving maximum development impact from available resources, the strategy defines seven
pro-poor expenditure priorities: (i)
rehabilitation and maintenance o f transport infrastructure; (ii)
promotion o f income earning opportunities; (iii)
basic education; (iv) development-oriented
informal adult education; (v) primary health care; (vi) HIV/AIDS prevention; and (vii) law and
justice. GoPNG has made progress in reorienting broad public expenditure categories toward
M T D S priorities, but the real test lies in fully implementing the strategy. The M T D S recognizes
that effective implementation depends on clarifying the fiscal envelope, identifying cost savings,
and improving the efficiency o f public spending. Inter-related tools include the Medium Term
Fiscal Strategy, the associated Medium Term Debt Strategy, and efforts to strengthen public
expenditure and personnel management begun under the Public Expenditure Review and
Rationalization (PERR) process.

37.
The MTDS was prepared through a consultative process and is widely owned. The
M T D S seeks to strengthen ownership and implementation through strategic alliances and
partnerships with key stakeholders, including provincial and local governments, churches,
community-based organizations (CBOs), NGOs, ordinary Papua New Guineans, international
development partners, and the private sector. Consultations involved all levels o f government
and civil society representatives, took place across the country, and revealed strong support for
the three strategic priorities.
Such feelings were expressed by young people during the Bank-sponsoredYouth Open Space Forum in July
2006.

PNG’ s Development Program,
Prospects, and Challenges

13

38.
Development partners have endorsed the MTDS and are defining their assistance
programs according to its priorities. The national MDGs have been incorporated into the
strategy and are relatively well specified, though more work needs to be done in defining targets
for combating diseases, protecting the environment, and strengthening partnerships for global
development. UNDP i s supporting GoPNG in i t s efforts to refine these targets. The
Government has adopted an M T D S performance framework, but there i s a need to clarify and
strengthen the targets and indicators. The Bank Group supports GoPNG’s framework and w i l l
help further define targets and indicators, with a view to using these to evaluate CAS results.

B. Medium-TermEconomic Outlook
39.
PNG’s macroeconomic outlook is expected to remain positive if the current direction of
fiscal and monetary policy is maintained (Table 3). Real GDP growth rates over the CAS period
are projected b y the staffs o f the Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be around 4
percent per year on average, with faster growth in 2009-2010 (when several new mines are due
to be commissioned). With structural reforms assumed to proceed only gradually, non-mineral
growth i s expected to be slower than overall economic growth. The external current account
surplus would narrow considerably following an anticipated decline in prices o f key export
commodities and an increase in demand (both for the imports needed to construct new mines,
and for domestic consumption and investment). Foreign exchange reserve accumulation would
continue, although more slowly than in recent years. Fiscal surpluses are also forecast to decline
as mineral revenues fall and spending, especially on investment projects, increases. The nonmineral fiscal deficit should remain broadly stable, however, with efforts to sustain non-mineral
tax revenue collections. The central bank i s expected to contain the inflationary pressures
emanating from record-high natural resource revenues and expanding domestic credit, with
inflation likely to remain in the lower to middle single digits.

These growth prospects are moderated by substantial downside risks. Given the
40.
structure and openness o f PNG’s economy, a sharp decline in world commodity prices or the
postponement or closure o f large mineral projects would heighten the need for fiscal adjustment
to permit continued room for essential development spending. Excessive or inefficient spending
could place upward pressure on prices, leading to a rise in interest rates and a consequent
dampening o f growth. A lukewarm commitment to further structural reform could curb investor
confidence. The rapid spread o f HIV/AIDS would impair growth and human development. On
the upside, the rapid development of PNG’s gas reserves could improve the longer-term outlook
for growth.

Prospects, and Challenges

41.
I n addition to sustained formal sector growth, significant reductions in poverty and
unemployment will require the expansion of opportunities for income generation and improved
service delivery, especially in rural areas. Broad-based growth requires a medium-term fiscal
policy that gives priority to infrastructure and service provision, as well as structural reforms to
stimulate investment and productivity in the non-mineral sector.

42.
PNG is considered to be at low to moderate risk of debt distress, and sustained vigilance
assumes
in public debt management will be required. Under the baseline scenario-which
continued prudence in fiscal policy, relatively favorable external circumstances, and moderate
levels o f growth-PNG’s external public and publicly-guaranteed debt i s sustainable, dropping
from 21 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 16 percent in 2011, and to 6 percent in 2026.’* PNG faces a
l o w to moderate risk o f debt distress under the IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis
framework for low-income countries (Attachment C), but given the economy’s vulnerability to
external shocks, i t i s prudent to take a cautious view o f PNG’s debt service capacity. GoPNG
has recognized the risks, and i t s Medium Term Debt Strategy targets a further reduction in debt
ratios.

C. Papua New Guinea’s Development Challenges and Opportunities
43.

As described above, PNG faces a number of formidable challenges on the road to
enhanced growth and poverty reduction, but there are also considerable opportunities for
progress. In responding decisively to these challenges and establishing partnerships with key
stakeholders, PNG’s decision makers have the opportunity to harness considerable resources in
pursuit o f improved economic and social development in the years to come.

44.
Promoting strong, accountable, and sustainable performance of resource-based
exports. Growth in the extractive industries and other resource-based exports can be sustained
over the medium term by enabling responsible investment, exploration, and innovation, while
minimizing the environmental damage from extractive activities and logging. Measures to
improve the collection and management o f natural resource revenues w i l l help finance national
poverty reduction programs; in addition, locally based strategies can be used to enhance the
benefits that enclave projects bring to local communities. Improved transparency in mining and
petroleum revenues, as the EITI principles mandate, and improved forestry concession
management w i l l help local people have a voice in how resource-based industries are managed
and w i l l also help provide a secure environment for long-term investment in these sectors.

45.
Diversifying economic growth to broaden the potential for livelihood improvements.
There i s a need to use the window afforded by today’s high mineral prices to diversify PNG’s
economic base. As the supplies o f exhaustible resources dwindle, growth in the non-mineral
sectors w i l l become increasingly important. Growth opportunities exist in food production for
the domestic market, high-value export crops, plantation forestry and downstream agro-industry,
small-scale manufacturing, tourism, and the service industry. Prospects are also good for
artisanal and small-scale activities in fishing, mining, and village-based forestry. Harnessing the
potential for economic growth in the non-mineral sector requires increased investment efficiency
and urgent efforts to improve the investment environment and promote entrepreneurship.
The total (external and domestic) public sector debt ratio i s projected to decline from 39 percent of GDP in 2006
to 32 percent by 201 1 and 15 percent by 2027.

15

Role of Development Partners

46.
Ensuring good governance and sound public financial management. Good governance
i s fundamental to equitable economic growth and the efficient delivery o f services. GoPNG has
taken important steps to improve fiscal discipline and establish sound policies, laws, and
oversight institutions. What i s now required i s to ensure that these policies are adhered to, that
laws are enforced, and that oversight institutions are given the human and financial resources
they need to accomplish their mission. The system o f governance in PNG has the potential to be
strong and vibrant if careful attention i s paid to improving the financial and operational
structures for decentralized service delivery; this in turn requires transparent information and
accountability at all levels o f government.
47.
Ensuring that development resources are delivered equitably throughout the country.
Better access to roads, energy, and communications would have a major beneficial impact on the
lives o f the poor. A recent study indicated that cutting the average travel time to the nearest road
by two to three hours could lower the incidence o f poverty in PNG b y 6 to 12 percent.” In
addition, curbing the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS and ensuring that local health and education
providers (including the Government and NGOs) are well staffed and resourced are essential
both for improved rural productivity and to the achievement o f the country’s MDGs.
48.
Empowering women and youth. Enhancing the ability o f women and girls to access
education, health services, markets, credit, and income-earning opportunities can improve
development outcomes and broaden the participation o f ordinary Papua New Guineans in their
country’s economic growth. Reducing the rate o f gender-based violence would limit a major
factor in the rapid spread o f HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. Providing
young people with a relevant education and opportunities for income generation can tap into a
vital source o f entrepreneurial energy, while curbing the potential for dissatisfaction and idleness
to foster crime, gang activity, and abuse o f alcohol and drugs.
49.
Protecting the environment and mitigating the risk of natural disasters. PNG’s natural
environment has brought economic and social wealth to i t s people for thousands o f years, but i t
i s now under threat-from
intensified farming, unsustainable logging, destructive fishing
technology, the pollution o f streams and rivers b y extractive industries, as well as from climate
change and natural disasters. Efforts to raise environmental awareness, enforce environmental
policies and laws, and provide sufficient resources to relevant agencies are needed, as i s the
integration o f disaster preparedness and mitigation into the country’s development. With
responsible use, PNG’s natural resources offer the potential to sustain many generations to come
by supporting rural livelihoods and attracting tourism and revenues.
IV. ROLE OF DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
A. Development Partner Activities
50.
PNG mobilizes substantial assistance from international development partners.
Australia’s program i s the largest, with AusAID providing grants o f about U S $ 300 million per
year.20 Focus areas include governance and nation building, infrastructure (especially roads),

Gibson and Rozelle. 2003. “Poverty and Access to Roads in Papua New Guinea.” Economic Development and
Cultural Change. Oct. 2003.52(1): 159-185.

I n addition, the Australian Treasury’s Enhanced Cooperation Program has deployed about 40 Australian
Government employees in advisory and in-line positions throughout GoPNG.

livelihoods development (agriculture, private sector development), basic service delivery, and
HIV/AIDS. The Asian Development Bank (US$28 million per year) focuses on public financial
management, private sector development, transport, health, and HIV/AIDS. The European
Commission (US$ 35 million per year) concentrates on rural development and environment,
education and training, health, governance and decentralization, civil society, and electoral
support. The United Nations agencies (US$ 8 million per year)21 focus on capacity building,
crisis management, human development, gender equity, and HIV/AIDS. New Zealand provides
about US$ 15 million per year for rural livelihoods development, health, education, law and
justice, governance, and civil society development. Other key bilateral partners include China,
Germany, Japan, and Korea. The IMF has a Resident Representative in PNG, working closely
with the GoPNG on macroeconomic issues and conducting periodic Article I V Consultations.
(See Attachment D for a listing o f development partner programs.)

51.
GoPNG works closely with a variety of non-governmental partners. These include
international and national NGOs, CBOs, religious organizations, and the private sector. The
Papua New Guinea Sustainable Development Program, Ltd. (PNGSDP), established in 200 1 b y
GoPNG and the BHP Billiton mining company, i s an independent trust devoted to investing a
portion o f profits from the O k Tedi mine in sustainable development activities. PNGSDP’s
principal areas o f focus are infrastructure, rural development, energy, microfinance, and
community development.
B. Donor Coordination and Aid Effectiveness
There is considerable room to improve donor coordination in PNG, but steps are being
taken to enhance dialogue and align donor programs with national goals. Development partners
work under different institutional arrangements, and as in many other countries there have been
inconsistent messages and programming overlaps. T o address this concern, GoPNG instituted an
annual joint Government-Donor Consultation Forum in 2005 and has established a series o f

52.

Thematic Working Groups. A Technical Working Group on Aid Effectiveness has been created,
and GoPNG and all i t s development partners have issued a joint statement committing to localize
the principles o f the Paris Declaration and define targets and actions to improve aid effectiveness
b y 2012 (Attachment E). In addition, ADB, AusAID, and the World Bank are working toward
improving harmonization o f approaches in the transport sector. Though the harmonization
agenda faces important challenges (including the need for continued strengthening of fiduciary
and accountability systems, and widely varying institutional structures and program sizes among
donors), the Bank Group i s committed to working with GoPNG and development partners to
improve aid effectiveness. GoPNG has had reservations in the past about a unified donor
strategy approach, but development partner alignment behind the M T D S provides a positive
opportunity to increase coordination among donors and with the Government’s programs. ADB,
AusAID, and the UN have recently issued country strategies, and the E C and NZAID are in the
process o f developing theirs. The CAS draws on these to ensure complementarity. In addition,
the Bank Group w i l l help to strengthen GoPNG’s capacity to lead donor coordination; this w i l l
include assisting the Government to prepare the next MTDS.

21 The UN agencies expect to mobilize an additional US$77 million over five years, or about US$ 15 million per
year.

17

Bank Group Assistance Strategy

53.
Recognizing that a coordinated approach is critical to achieving tangible results in PNG,
development partners have begun to strengthen collaboration in key sectors. Multi-donor
programmatic support has been adopted to enhance coordination and aid effectiveness in the
health sector, and momentum i s building for s i m i l a r approaches in education, transport, and law
and justice. Development partners have also had some success in conducting joint analytical
initiatives. ADB, AusAID, and the World Bank have worked together to support GoPNG in
developing a human development strategy and in implementing PERR recommendations to
streamline governance and public expenditure management, PNGSDP has become an important
development partner for the Bank Group, providing co-financing to the Smallholder Agriculture
Development Project (SADP) and the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (RMRP) as
well as supporting the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-financed Teacher’s Solar Lighting
Project (TSLP), and collaborating with the I F C on microfinance and forestry.
V. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A. Lessons of Experience
Lessons from Previous World Bank Involvement
54.
I n 2000, a Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) rated the outcome of the World Bank
Group’s assistance program to PNG in the 1990s as “unsatisfactory, with modest institutional
development impact and uncertain sustainability.” O n the positive side, the C A E recognized the
country team’s focus on policy issues, high quality economic and sector work, and positive
efforts in engaging NGOs. Partly in response to the CAE’s recommendations, the Bank scaled
back i t s lending program, making no new loans to PNG between June 2002 and April 2007. The
country team focused on intensifying communication with Government and civil society on the
basis o f an expanded program o f analytical and advisory activities (AAA) and outreach
programs. The Bank liaison office in Port Moresby was upgraded to a full Country Office, and
in January 2006 I F C established a full-time in-country presence through i t s Private Enterprise
Partnership for the Pacific (PEP-Pacific). Dialogue with Government, donors, and civil society
continues to broaden and deepen as a result o f these measures.

55.
The 1999-2002 CAS focused on governance and rural development. The Bank flagship
under this CAS was a Governance Promotion Adjustment Loan, supported by investments in
health, education, smallholder o i l palm development, rehabilitation o f the Gazelle Peninsula,
solar power, and technical assistance in mining and petroleum. Good progress was made in the
smaller investments, but two structural adjustment loans and the Forestry and Conservation
Project (FCP) did not achieve their intended outcomes. Problems encountered included
Government capacity limitations and bureaucratic delays, corruption, ineffective donor
coordination, difficulties receiving counterpart funds, and inadequate Government engagement
with private sector and civil society. Perceptions o f the Bank’s role in PNG turned decidedly
negative in some quarters. Added to this, controversy attached itself to the FCP. In August
2003, the Bank suspended disbursements due to noncompliance with legal covenants and with
the country’s own legislation regarding the award of forest concessions. The loan, which
comprised a US$ 17.36 million IBRD loan and two GEF grants o f SDR 13.31 million each, was
eventually cancelled at the Government’s request in June 2005, with only US$ 2.6 million o f
US$40 million disbursed.

Bank Group Assistance Strategy

18

56.
I n the face of growing political and economic uncertainty and a deterioration in its
relationship with GoPNG, the Bank opted to produce an Interim Strategy Note in March 2005.
The Bank had launched preparation o f a new CAS in 2002, joining ADB and AusAID in
pursuing improved donor coordination through the elaboration o f a Joint Country Strategy (JCS).
This effort was set aside in view o f the Government’s concern that the JCS was a means for
donors to exert coordinated pressure on the Government, and b y Australia’s introduction o f the
ECP in 2004 (it being unclear initially how the hands-on approach o f the ECP would affect the
overall aid environment). The I S N focused on promoting development dialogue, stemming the
decline in social indicators and building the foundations for recovery and improved governance.
57.
The approach taken under the ISN has shown promise, but there is a need to further
refine dialogue, strengthen communication, and improve outcomes at both the national and local
levels. Sustained dialogue with GoPNG and other development partners has brought productive
collaboration in public expenditure management, human development, and transport, as well as a
broad endorsement o f M T D S priorities, Recent analytical work on poverty, public expenditure
and procurement, human development, transport, and energy has been well received and forms
the basis for more strategic and coordinated approaches in these sectors. Under the ISN, the
Bank has deepened i t s engagement at the local level, including through the promotion of
alternative energy sources in teachers’ homes and continued reconstruction and development in
the Gazelle region. A much stronger focus on communication and outreach has not only
improved understanding and perceptions o f the Bank in PNG, but has empowered citizens to
play a greater role in the country’s development.22 The cancellation o f the FCP highlighted
several important lessons for the design and implementation o f complex programs in PNG,
including the need for comprehensive institutional and political analysis to ensure that project
objectives are aligned with the interests and incentives of both the implementing agency and the
beneficiary community. Other elements o f the I S N were not accomplished as a result o f
insufficient coordination between the Bank, the Government, and other development partnersfor example, plans to conduct an updated poverty analysis on the basis o f a new household
survey and Demographic and Health Survey were not implemented due to delays in the design
and implementation o f underlying surveys. The Bank did however lead the PERR (with ADB
and AusAID assistance) as well as the PESD (with AusAID and the National Research Institute).
Both activities worked well, and the PERR has helped sustain Government-donor policy
dialogue during a difficult period. (See Attachment F for a more thorough assessment o f
progress and performance under the ISN.) The CAS for 2008-201 1 draws on the lessons learned
under the I S N by maintaining and deepening this intensified approach to dialogue,
communication, and outreach with Government and non-government stakeholders across PNG.
Portfolio Management

58.
Portfolio pefonnance during the pre-ISN period was compromised by a lack of
counterpart funding, problems with special accounts, and overdue audits. Two o f the five
projects in the portfolio (Gazelle Restoration and RMRP) were considered at risk o f not
22
Examples include the active participation in the Tingim Yut Kornpetisen development marketplace, the Youth
Open Space Forum, and the Women in Mining initiative. In addition, the Bank has taken advantage o f the Public
Information Center and the Global Distance Learning Network’s Distance Learning Center to strengthen
information-sharing within PNG, as well as between PNG and other countries.

19

Bank Group Assistance Strategy

achieving their development objectives. Their status has since been upgraded, though long-term
risk flags remain due to historical performance. The two projects that closed during the I S N
period (Mining TA and Petroleum TA) were rated satisfactory at the time o f closing.
The current portfolio is small, but effective. There are no safeguard, monitoring and
59.
evaluation, counterpart funding, or legal covenant issues facing any o f the active projects in the
portfolio.23 With recent improvements in government revenues, counterpart funding i s no longer
an issue. The current portfolio has managed the operation of special accounts reasonably well,
and timeliness o f audit reports i s expected to improve now that the Auditor General’s office
(responsible for auditing Bank-financed projects) has augmented i t s capacity by contracting out
some o f the work to private sector auditors. Aside from audit issues, financial management
arrangements in the portfolio have been satisfactory. Ongoing project operations have been rated
moderately satisfactory or satisfactory for procurement performance, which i s mainly affected b y
insufficient co-financing and lack o f adequate local procurement skills. Despite improvements,
the portfolio s t i l l has a country record flag over which individual projects have no control.
The portfolio of trust funds is relatively modest. Current trust funds include a Japan
60.
Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) for SADP preparation and two Japan
Social Development Fund (JSDF) grants to support women and artisanal and small-scale miners
under the Mining TA operations. The PNG country program has drawn substantial resources
from GEF, including for TSLP and regional work on sustainable energy financing, and from the
Australian-funded Pacific Facility I1 and I11 trust funds. The CAS for 2008-2011 envisages
continued use o f available trust funds to support operational and administrative costs, including
GEF, the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), Pacific Facility, and others.

Feedback from Stakeholder Consultations
61.

I n preparing the CAS, the Bank team received valuable advice from consultations with a
broad cross-section of stakeholders. During 2001-2003, before moving to an I S N approach, the

PNG country team conducted extensive CAS consultations at national and sub-national levels,
with both government and non-government stakeholders. These consultations (particularly those
carried out in rural areas) pointed to a consistent set o f priorities: (i)
reducing corruption and
improving public accountability and transparency; (ii)promoting agricultural development,
especially market information and access; (iii)promoting small business development, the
informal sector, and access to credit, while reducing impediments to business formation; (iv)
upgrading roads, shipping services, electricity, and water supply; (v) improving access to and
quality o f education and health services, especially in rural areas; and (vi) facilitating better
access to information. Stakeholders indicated that donors had an important role to play, but
should insist on more accountability and transparency, direct more funds to the community level,
prevent project loans from increasing public debt, and consult stakeholders more frequently.

62.

I n refining the CAS, the Bank consulted widely with Government, civil society, the private
sector, and the donor community and received very similar feedback once again. In these recent
consultations, civil society representatives encouraged the Bank and other development partners
to involve CBOs in the design and implementation o f community-based development programs.

Women’s groups emphasized the importance o f improving rural infrastructure, strengthening law

and order, enhancing livelihood opportunities, and mainstreaming gender-related activities
across all sectors. Among representatives o f the private sector, the top priorities were
infrastructure development, the business environment, governance, and security. Development
partners confirmed their interest in strengthening donor coordination through programmatic
approaches and joint work, in line with M T D S priorities and each donor’s comparative
advantage. Over the course o f several joint Bank-Government retreats this year on the proposed
CAS, GoPNG initially highlighted four key areas for World Bank Group support: (i)
stimulating
economic growth and creating economic opportunities for poor people; (ii)promoting
improving governance; and (iv) enhancing human
sustainable natural resource management; (iii)
development and service delivery. In later sessions, GoPNG placed particular emphasis on the
first two o f these areas and requested that the selection of CAS program activities be prioritized
according to their contribution to alleviating poverty, both incomelconsumption poverty and
poverty o f access. These priorities came together to form the two pillars o f the CAS.

B. Proposed Bank Group Assistance Strategy
Key Features of the CASfor 2008-2011

63.
The CAS seeks to foster a constructive, long-term partnership with the government,
people, and development partners of Papua New Guinea to further the goals set out in the MTDS
and MDGs. PNG’s development strategy embodies a tension between a longer-term capacity
and institution-building agenda, and a need to deliver manifestly improved services in the near
term. The CAS, accordingly, i s structured to address short-term service deficits without ignoring
the longer-tern institutional and policy challenge. As noted above, the four-year CAS should be
seen as the first in a series that w i l l cover the next 15 to 20 years, allowing the Bank Group space
to tackle immediate concerns while working at a more appropriate pace on issues that w i l l
require a generation or longer to bear real fruit. I t i s also a results-based CAS, establishing
targets and indicators by which realistic progress over the CAS period can be measured.
64.
With poverty reduction as its overarching objective, the CAS consists of two pillars:
(I) Promoting and maintaining sound economic and natural resource management, and
(11) Improving livelihoods and service delivery, especially for the rural poor. The two pillars
respond to the dualistic nature o f the PNG economy, and to the main M T D S goal o f fostering
sustainable quality o f life improvements by promoting economic growth and social development.
Activities under Pillar Iw i l l focus on three key areas: strengthening governance, particularly
public financial management and core oversight functions; maintaining sound management of
the extractive industries through improved exploration, revenue management, and environmental
and social sustainability; and promoting effective and sustainable management of natural
resources, both as a significant basis for rural livelihoods and as global public goods. Activities
under Pillar I1w i l l address five main topics: supporting development of the private sector as the
engine of growth, focusing on the business environment, niche industries, and public-private
partnerships; enhancing rural livelihoods, particularly in the o i l palm and artisanal and smallscale mining sectors; improving local service delivery through community-driven development
approaches and other innovative service delivery models that strengthen local governance;
expanding access to infrastructure services, particularly rural roads, electricity, and
telecommunications; and supporting multi-donor approaches to human development, focusing
on expanded access to basic education, improved health system performance, and effective
responses to HIVIAIDS.

Bank Group Assistance Strategy

21

65.

Activities under each pillar will be selected and prioritized according to their role in
alleviating poverty, together with the Bank Group’s comparative advantage among development
partners. As cross-cutting issues, improving governance and empowering women and youth w i l l
be mainstreamed across both pillars. (See Attachment G for a review o f governance and
anticorruption approaches under the CAS.)

66.

To better align the CAS with PNG’s key institutional arrangements, the CAS is designed
to be delivered at both the national and local level. The Bank w i l l aim to support the efforts o f
national-level institutions to facilitate economic growth and poverty reduction, while at a subnational level (and especially at the district level and below) focusing on improving service
delivery systems, drawing on a range o f existing and non-traditional delivery models. Figure 3
depicts the overall approach embodied b y the CAS.
Figure 3: A Strategy for Engagement in PNG

Service Delivery for
Natural Resources

67.
The CAS represents a joint Bank-IFC strategy, recognizing the substantial scope for
synergy between public and private sector development activities. The Bank and I F C w i l l work
to integrate their country programs, from upstream analytical work to complementary investment
and advisory activities in areas such as natural resource management, rural development and
agriculture (especially agro-industries), infrastructure, and the overall business environment. As
an example o f this, I F C plans to support the expansion o f microfinance, while the Bank w i l l
address infrastructure constraints to small business growth (such as poor roads and l o w access to
electricity). The Bank and I F C w i l l also look for opportunities to co-finance work in areas l i k e
airport and aviation development, rural telecommunications, fisheries development, gas field
exploitation, and forestry.

World Bank Group Instruments and Selectivity
68.
Today’s small but efective portfolio provides a good basis for a fresh start in PNG. The
current portfolio i s limited to three projects: the Second Gazelle Restoration Project; the RMRP,
with supplemental financing; and the GEF-supported TSLP. All three projects are performing
satisfactorily.

Bank Group Assistance Strategy

22

Selectivity is critical to maximizing impact within a limited resource envelope. The
69.
estimated IDA allocation for FY08 i s about US$ 45 million (including about US$ 18 million in
unused carryover from FY06 and FY07). For FY09-FY 11, the indicative IDA allocation i s more
modest, at about US$30-32 million per year, though actual amounts will be determined annually
on the basis o f PNG’s performance relative to other IDA borrowers. I t i s expected that Bank
financing w i l l be provided on IDA terms. As a blend country, PNG could also possibly tap into
IBRD resources, though this would require careful scrutiny on a case-by-case basis and would be
subject to a creditworthiness evaluation by IBRD. Country program funds w i l l also include the
combined resources o f IFC’s PEP-Pacific and the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS).
Given the resource limitations, the CAS aims to restrict new IDA operations to a maximum o f
three in a typical year. Similarly, “core” AAA tasks would be limited to two per year in an effort
to ensure adequate analytical and policy depth.
Box 1: Principles of Engagement in PNG
The CAS sets out five guiding principles for future engagement in PNG.

1. Long-term Partnership: Partnering with Government and key stakeholder groups, recognizing that
comprehensive development w i l l take time, and managing expectations on all sides
2. Government Leadership: Providing (and encouraging other donors to provide) development assistance in
line with the Government’s own priorities and strategies, and engaging in more consistent policy dialogue
with the GoPNG

3. Country Ownership: Fostering real ownership o f reform and development programs b y strengthening
existing GoPNG structures and processes; encouraging sustainable, affordable, and effective government
decisions; and helping to strengthen implementation capacity, avoiding expensive duplication o f structures
and proliferation o f external consultants

4. Results Focus: Seeking to define intended results not only over the CAS period, but also over the longer
term, to support strengthened data collection and analysis, and to develop and implement comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms
5. Openness and Transparency: Making a concerted effort to communicate with and reach out to broader
society, including the private sector, NGOs, and CBOs such as Women’s Associations, youth organizations,
and church-based service delivery groups; and to support the GoPNG’s own efforts in this area

70.
The CAS aims to focus the Bank Group’s comparatively modest country program
resources as well as draw on regional and global funds to PNG. Country-level interventions
w i l l focus on areas where the Bank has established a good track record in PNG (mining,
telecommunications, transport, and rural energy); where the Bank can draw on i t s global reach to
complement other donors’ activities (in sectors such as education, health, utility reform, and
environmental management); or where the I F C can leverage private sector investment (financial
markets, extractive industries, agribusiness, manufacturing, and telecommunications).
Operations w i l l be complemented b y AAA that draws on experience from around the world, and
by efforts to help strengthen PNG’s data bases (e.g. on the effectiveness o f public expenditures
and on poverty). The CAS w i l l also continue to support the current crop o f successful
community outreach programs (footnote 22). In addition to country program resources, the Bank

23

Bank Group Assistance Strategy

Grou can access regional funds (such as the GEF Pacific Alliance for Sustainability (GEF
PAS)4! and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery) and global products (such
as F C ’ s work on improving the business enabling environment and emerging programs on
climate change and avoided deforestation). The principles underlying the Bank Group’s
engagement in PNG are laid out in B o x 1.
Strategic Pillars, Objectives, and Programs
Pillar I: Promoting and maintaining sound economic and natural resource management

7 1.
The first pillar of the CAS aims to consolidate recent improvements in economic growth
and fiscal policy while increasing transparency and accountability in the management of public
finances and natural resources. As part o f a longer-tern engagement strategy, the CAS w i l l
promote sound macroeconomic and public expenditure management, improved governance
through strengthened oversight o f the public sector, improved management and sustainability in
the extractive industries, and effective and sustainable management o f natural resources. Table 4
suggests links between these long-term objectives and the CAS outcomes to which Pillar I
activities aim to contribute.

24 The GEF-PAS i s a regionally-oriented, nationally-executed program for environmental management in the Pacific
region. The program would support capacity building and partnerships with civil society and the private sector,
recognizing the advantages o f a more coordinated approach to environmental management in the Pacific. PNG could
benefit significantly from participation in this program, and could position itself to acquire additional resources and
capacity if it chooses to participate actively.

Bank Group Assistance Strategy

24

73.

Improving the effectiveness and transparency of budget preparation, execution, and
reporting. Building on the Government’s substantial progress in strengthening the legal and

regulatory framework for public expenditure management and procurement, the CAS w i l l
support efforts to enhance the credibility o f budgeting and tendering through improved
compliance and enforcement. The Bank w i l l continue to engage with GoPNG under a multidonor framework, including through the PERR process and implementation o f CPAR
recommendations. The proposed Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) would shed light
on the impediments to effective public spending at the agency and sub-national levels.

74.
Strengthening oversight of the public sector. As recognized in the Bank’s new
Governance and Anticorruption Strategy, strong, well-functioning accountability institutions are
essential if corruption, mismanagement, and waste in the public sector are to be contained. The
proposed Strengthening Institutions o f Oversight and Accountability (SIOA) Project would help
strengthen the capacity o f the Auditor General, Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, and
Ombudsman Commission to conduct and evaluate audits and investigations. SIOA w i l l also help
to strengthen the Central Supply and Tender Board, which oversees public procurement.
Collaboration with AusAID on programmatic support to the law and justice sector i s also under
consideration.

75.
Supporting improved monitoring of government performance through greater public
availability of information. Building on GoPNG’s ongoing “Opening the Budget” initiative, the
Bank Group w i l l help develop the capacity o f CBOs, NGOs, journalists, and citizens to engage
with the Government b y working with ministries to issue information in a format that can be
easily understood b y the general reader, and b y helping civil society organizations to develop
capacity for budget analysis, citizen monitoring, and investigative journalism. As part o f the
SIOA approach, the Bank w i l l emphasize partnerships with provincial governments, civil
society, and research and policy institutes, combined with technical assistance, training in budget
analysis, local-level pilots, and selective interventions at the grassroots level. In cooperation
with ADB, AusAID, and IMF, and with support from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the Bank w i l l help GoPNG move to adoption of
EITI principles in the mining and petroleum sectors.

76.

Strengthening institutional structures in the mining sector, with an emphasis on
transparent management and resource distribution. The Second Mining Development TA
operation aims to strengthen the legislative and institutional framework for mining in PNG,
including in Bougainville; build capacity for increased tax collection and mine closure planning;
and help mine-affected communities to manage the benefits and risks from mining activities
(including those to women and youth). The Bank Group i s also considering the provision of

support for a gas development risk-sharing operation with the ADB. This may complement the
potential I F C participation in the commercialization o f gas resources,

77.
Promoting sustainable management of natural resources. The CAS w i l l focus on areas
where GoPNG has expressed openness to engaging with development partners, including
capacity building and possible readiness activities under the Reduced Emissions from
Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) program. PNG w i l l also participate in the GEF-PAS, a
regional Bank-managed GEF initiative focusing on environmental management and adaptation to
climate change. IFC i s planning to support PNGSDP’s sustainable forestry initiative. The CAS
w i l l adopt a long-term perspective to re-engagement in the forestry sector, working to establish a

25

Bank Group Assistance Strategy

basis for discussion and engagement with GoPNG in this area, possibly under the REDD
program.
Pillar II: Improving livelihoods and sewice delivery, especially for the rural poor

78.
The second pillar of the CAS aims to encourage broad-based economic growth and wider
participation in economic development through expanded opportunities for income generation
and improved services, especially for the rural poor. Over the longer term, the Bank Group
intends to help reduce poverty in PNG by promoting private sector development, sustainable and
inclusive rural growth, responsive and accountable local governments, well-managed transport
services, expanded access to reliable and affordable energy and telecommunications, and
improved human development outcomes. Table 5 suggests links between these long-term
objectives and the CAS outcomes to which Pillar 11activities aim to contribute.

Promoting growth in niche industries. The CAS w i l l focus on sectors where PNG has a
comparative advantage (such as tourism and niche agribusiness products such as coffee, cocoa,
spices, and some fisheries and forestry products). PEP-Pacific w i l l build on existing support for
the development o f a Tourism Master Plan b y diagnosing barriers to tourism investment and
marketing, strengthening access to markets, regulatory and institutional reforms, and investment
support. PEP-Pacific w i l l also work to leverage partnerships with private sector agribusiness
f i r m s to strengthen supply chains, including commodity standards and certification and training
and financing for suppliers.
8 1.
Supporting private sector development through public-private partnerships in
infrastructure development. The I F C w i l l advise on strengthening private sector participation in
infrastructure and other public services, and on restructuring state-owned enterprises. Apart
from potential opportunities to leverage IFC assistance in the delivery o f rural electricity and
telecommunications, the CAS w i l l support regional analytical work in the fisheries and aviation
sectors, which may point to further opportunities for public-private partnerships in PNG.
82.
Seizing opportunities for more inclusive and sustainable rural growth and income
generation. The CAS w i l l support income generation in areas where the Bank i s already
engaged, including development in the smallholder o i l palm sector25 and further support for
artisanal and small-scale mining.26The CAS would also stimulate growth in rural areas through
joint Bank-EC implementation o f a proposed Rural Development Program (RDP), and through
support for increased access to modern energy and IT services. The Bank’s support o f income
generation opportunities w i l l draw on a comprehensive program o f AAA, including a Poverty
Assessment and a Rural Growth and Livelihoods Strategy (possibly in cooperation with the EC).
A Youth Integration Strategy would be developed to address problems of youth unemployment
and exclusion, with a particular focus on urban areas.

83.
Improving local service delivery through partnerships between government and civil
society, and within and across communities. Within the framework of decentralization reform,
the CAS w i l l support analysis intended to better understand the flow and use o f resources in
selected districts. A District Service Delivery and Local Governance Project would help
strengthen local governments and support service delivery partnerships with churches and CBOs.
The Provincial Reconstruction and Development Program would adapt the successful service
delivery model o f the Gazelle Restoration Authority to other areas. CAS support for C D D
approaches would be underpinned by a number o f AAA and outreach activities, including the
C E M and a Review of Local Service Delivery Models. The Bank w i l l continue the Women in
Mining initiative, expanding i t s focus to address youth concerns as well.

25 Through the SADP, the CAS w i l l sustainably enhance the involvement o f targeted communities in their local
development through measures aimed at increasing o i l palm revenue and local participation.
26 The CAS w i l l support artisanal and small-scale mining as a significant source o f rural income b y improving
extension services and training youth in new, environmentally sound mining and processing technologies. This
work w i l l build on successful pilot initiatives under the JSDF grant program, with increased support for women and
youth through both JSDF and the Mining T A operation.

27

84.

Bank Group Assistance Strategy

Improving access to specific economic and social services, including:

Under Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation supplemental financing and RMRP II,the CAS w i l l support planning and
management in the roads sector, rehabilitation o f key national and provincial roads and
bridges, and stronger institutional arrangements for road maintenance in line with
GoPNG’s National Transport Development Plan. The Bank w i l l continue to work with
ADB and AusAID to improve harmonization in the transport sector. Bank-supported
road sector activities w i l l support a broader approach to infrastructure, and a National
Infrastructure Study i s planned in order to explore the financing, delivery, and
maintenance o f a sustainable infrastructure system for PNG.

Improving the condition of roads and bridges.

Expanding the availability and lowering the cost of electricity services in rural centers
and towns. The CAS w i l l continue to support alternative energy in rural areas through
the TSLP, in cooperation with Papua New Guinea Sustainable Energy, Ltd. (PNGSEL), a
PNGSDP subsidiary. In addition, the Bank w i l l partner with PNGSEL to implement a
Rural Electrification Project to bring electricity and Internet access to households,

schools, health clinics, and rural enterprises across PNG. CAS support to the energy
sector will be underpinned b y various pieces o f AAA, including the National
Infrastructure Study and a joint Bank-ADB Regulatory Framework Study.
Expanding access to affordable and reliable telecommunications services in rural
areas and outside Port Moresby. The proposed Rural Communications Project would
provide TA and seed funding to help establish a rural communications fund, which would

aim to stimulate extension o f telecommunications infrastructure (mobile telephony and,
where feasible, Internet) to commercially non-viable areas. Once infrastructure and
enabling policies are in place, the Bank (possibly in partnership with I F C and CGAP)
w i l l explore opportunities to support income generation through mobile phone-enabled
financial services for the rural poor. This work may be facilitated b y a potential IFC
investment in mobile telephony.
Increasing primary school participation and retention. The CAS w i l l promote the
achievement o f universal basic education in PNG, providing TA to support GoPNG’s
participation in FTI and application for grant financing from the Catalytic Fund. Once

FTI funding has been secured, the CAS may provide programmatic support to Basic
Education.
Improving health system performance and strengthening the national response to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. In an effort to better understand the nature of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic in PNG, the CAS w i l l support a national population bio-behavioral survey. In

coordination with donor partners the CAS w i l l also support the ongoing multi-donor
programmatic approach in the health sector.
85.
The proposed CAS program for FY08 to F Y l l is laid out in Table 6. This program may
not be realized in full, and should be understood as indicative and inclusive; i t s exact
composition w i l l depend on the availability o f IDA and Bank Group budget resources, evolving
opportunities, and the performance of GoPNG and the PNG economy. As indicated above, the
progress of the CAS program w i l l be reviewed on an annual basis with the Government, at which
time the coming year’s program w i l l be firmed up.

Risks and Mitigation Measures

Delivery Platforms

86.
To amplify the impact of the Bank’s relatively modest funding, the CAS will work
simultaneously at two levels, with national and local-level activities designed to complement one
another. At a national level, the CAS w i l l focus on unblocking the constraints to local-level
service effectiveness, concentrating on improved governance and public expenditure
management to promote accountability and transparency in the use of public resources,
especially through the use o f country systems for procurement and financial management. Local
level operations w i l l be used as a reality check on national-level policy and systems work, with
the Bank committed to ensuring strong inter-sectoral synergy. Given the growing coverage o f
provinces b y other development partners, local activities w i l l initially build on operations in
areas in which the Bank i s already active, and w i l l focus on supporting country systems o f local
planning and budgeting-the poor functioning o f which i s a major constraint to effective service
delivery.
Organizing to Deliver

87.
Successful implementation of the proposed CAS will require a new Bank Group approach
to doing business in PNG. The Bank w i l l give a stronger decision-making role and greater
autonomy to the country office and w i l l increase staffing to create a ‘core’ o f professionals
sufficient to conduct regular dialogue with GoPNG and other development partners, as well as to
provide continuous supervision and follow-up. A senior country economist has joined the Port
Moresby office, and the Bank i s in the process o f hiring a new senior operations officer and
additional national staff. T o strengthen coordination among a highly dispersed team, annual
country team retreats w i l l be held, complemented b y regular country team meetings via
videoconference. Through this joint CAS, the Bank, IFC, and FIAS aim to integrate their
individual country programs much more closely than before, including by preparing joint work.

88.
The CAS Results Matrix (Annex B9) presents a framework for the Bank’s engagement in
PNG over the next four years. I t takes as i t s starting point GoPNG’s priority objectives over the
longer term as laid out in the MTDS, and the challenges i t faces in achieving those goals. Within
that longer-term agenda, CAS outcomes are those that the Bank expects to influence directly
through i t s interventions, accompanied b y targets and indicators b y which to measure progress.
The Bank w i l l continue to support the Government’s efforts to refine i t s MTDS performance
management framework, with a view to eventually integrating GoPNG targets and indicators
into i t s evaluation o f CAS results. The results matrix has been developed in consultation with
GoPNG, development partners, and other key stakeholders in PNG’s development. A CAS
Progress Report w i l l provide a mid-term review o f the strategy’s relevance and implementation
progress, allowing for adjustments as needed. The results matrix w i l l be reviewed regularly to
incorporate new baseline data, targets, and indicators; to take stock o f progress on CAS
outcomes; and to adjust implementation plans accordingly.

VI. RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Country Risks

89.
Political conflict may lead to a serious decline in the governance environment. The CAS
w i l l aim to mitigate this risk by focusing on improved transparency and accountability in the use

Risks and Mitigation Measures

30

of extractive industry revenues, the institutional strengthening o f key oversight agencies, and
community-driven development approaches that emphasize good governance. In order to build
coalitions for improved governance, the CAS w i l l also support dialogue among key stakeholders,
including national and sub-national government, the private sector, civil society, and
development partners.
A fall in commodity prices may trigger a rapid decline in economic performance. The
90.
CAS w i l l support the steady accumulation o f reserves and the reduction o f public debt, as well as
promote the wise and effective use o f public resources, and intensify efforts to diversify the
economy.

91.
Growing unemployment, especially among urban youth, may lead to increased violence
and criminal activity, and to deteriorating social stability. The CAS w i l l support the articulation
of a Youth Integration Strategy designed to create productive employment opportunities for
youth at risk, especially in urban areas, and to create ways o f fostering their social and political
inclusion in community and political affairs.

92.
Natural disasters may cause significant economic disruption and social dislocation. The
CAS attempts to mitigate this risk b y supporting the development o f a climate change strategy
and PNG’s participation in regional disaster risk reduction initiatives, while also promoting
responsible and sustainable natural resource management practices.
Implementation Risks

93.

Lack of ownership of public expenditure and governance refonn and lack of support for
national oversight agencies may stall the progress of CAS implementation. The CAS attempts to
mitigate this risk by supporting efforts to build broad-based constituencies for change, reaching
out to civil society and the media b y helping them access information for monitoring and
evaluation. In addition, the SIAO program w i l l support the capacity o f PNG’s oversight
institutions to carry out their functions effectively and to communicate with citizens about their
work.

94.
The Bank’s engagement will either be too short-lived or too small-scale to affect
governance over the long term. The CAS only intends to take a first step in dealing with
complex socio-political issues o f this kind. Over time, and with persistence and consistent
engagement, the Bank expects to be able to assist significantly in spite o f i t s limited financial
capacity in PNG.

95.
Weaknesses in public fiduciary systems may impede project implementation. Through the
PERR and CPAR processes, the CAS w i l l attempt to reduce this risk b y strengthening GoPNG’s
capacity to implement effective, transparent procurement, and to apply and monitor procurement
and fiduciary guidelines systematically.
96.

Efforts to promote closer coordination between the Government and development
partners may not be successful. The CAS w i l l attempt to mitigate this risk b y a more
straightforward, transparent approach to communicating the Bank Group’s views and intentions,
and b y giving greater attention to consultation with a wide range o f stakeholders.

Attachment A: The Role of Extractive Industries in PNG
A. Background

1.
Exploration and Mineral Geology. Papua New Guinea has favorable geology for
minerals, oil and gas. The discovery o f the world class Panguna copper and gold deposit on the
island of Bougainville in the mid-1960s was followed b y the discovery o f the Ok Tedi copper
and gold deposit and the Frieda copper deposit in the late 1960s, and gold deposits at Porgera,
Misima, and Hidden Valley in the 1970s, and Lihir, Wafi, Simberi, Tolukuma, Mt Sinivit, and
Mt Kare in the 1980s and 1990s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, seabed mineral deposits
were identified and are now being explored. With the Bougainville Peace Accord and the
establishment o f the Autonomous Government o f Bougainville, Bougainville could again
become a prime destination for mineral exploration.

2.
Exploration and Hydrocarbon Development. O n the o i l and gas side, exploration in
the 1970s and 1980s led first to the discovery o f the Hides gas deposit and later the Kutubu o i l
deposit. Subsequently modest additional o i l and very substantial additional gas reservoirs were
discovered at Gobe, Moran and Mananda. Despite these mineral and hydrocarbon exploration
successes, exploration costs in PNG remain high because of remote locations and lack o f
infrastructure. Remaining proven, probable, and possible recoverable o i l reserves are estimated
at 185 million barrels. Oil production i s declining due to the maturity o f o i l fields and the
difficulty o f dealing with increasing volumes o f associated gas produced with oil. The producing
fields are likely to be largely depleted b y 2015. There has been no significant o i l find since the
discovery o f the Moran o i l field in 1996. Natural gas recoverable reserves and resources are
substantial, with an estimated 25 trillion cubic feet in proven, probable, and possible categories.
These reserves and resources are equivalent to about 5 billion barrels of oil.
3.
Government’s Strategy and M a i n Mining Developments. The Government’s strategy
i s to develop the extractive industries (EI) sector by encouraging socially, environmentally,
technically, and financially responsible private sector exploration and development o f PNG’s
mineral and hydrocarbon resources. The Panguna copper and gold mine started production in
the early 1970s, during a copper market boom, and was extremely profitable, providing
important balance o f payments and fiscal benefits for PNG as a whole at independence.
Production ceased in 1989 following an armed uprising which subsequently lasted over a decade
and the mine remains closed today, although peace has now been restored on the Island. Four
world class mines-Ok Tedi copper and gold mine and the Porgera, Misima and Lihir gold
mines-were subsequently developed in the 1980s and 1990s. There are also small gold
operations at Tolukuma, and Kainantu, with Hidden Valley and Simberi currently under
construction. A world-class nickel project i s also under construction at Ramu.
4.
M a i n Oil and Gas Developments. Since 1985, the oil industry has invested about U S $
5.8 billion in petroleum exploration and development. Commercial production o f o i l began in
1992, and a total o f about 400 million barrels o f o i l had been produced as o f August 2006.
Almost a l l o f the o i l has been exported. The Kutubu oil operation was developed in the early
1990s with additional o i l developments at Gobe and Moran in the late 1990s. The Hides gas
operation started production in the mid-1990s to provide power for the Porgera mine. An earlier
proposal for a gas development with a pipeline to Queensland has been shelved. The
Government has called for and given consideration to alternate gas developments, all o f which
31

Attachment A

32

would require processing the gas within PNG in order to bring more capital and operating
investment into the country, boost local employment and economic growth through project
construction activities, and enable synergies with domestic gas utilization projects. These
schemes variously include a methanol/di-methyl ether (DME) plant, production o f synthetic gasto-liquids (GTL) fuels, and an ammonidurea plant. In other developments, InterOil has made
announcements about establishing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and a natural gas liquids
(NGL) plant at Napa Napa based on i t s recent gas discovery at the Elk-1 well, which may have
found a large fractured carbonate reservoir with abundant recoverable gas. However, the extent
o f the discovery depends very much on the further evaluation o f the geological extent and
character o f the structure. The Government has also had talks with both the Chinese National
Petroleum Company and BG Group (formerly British Gas) about gas developments and gas
processing with an emphasis on LNG. There are now two different gas development project
proposals for LNG production in PNG, the most advanced o f which i s being prepared b y
ExxonMobil. LNG investments could eventually be in the range o f U S $ 10-15 billion. The gas
project would also help increase recoverable o i l since associated gas would no longer be reinjected which currently reduces potential oil production.

5.
Production. The main E1 production at present i s oil, copper and gold-almost all of
which are exported. The volumes and values o f E1 exports are as shown in Table A-1. O i l
production has declined from over 21 million bbls in 2001 to just over 14 million bbls in 2006
due to declining reserves. Oil and gas exploration has surged with increased commodity prices
and a revision o f o i l and gas fiscal incentives, but oil production w i l l continue to decline unless
new deposits are discovered. Gas production w i l l increase substantially because PNG has
extensive major gas reserves which are yet to be developed. With regard to minerals, copper
production, which i s primarily from O k Tedi, has fluctuated between 170,000 and 230,000 tons
per year depending on operating conditions, and in recent times there has also been copper
production from new smaller mines. Declining gold production at Misima, which closed in
2004, and Porgera, where reserves are declining, has been largely offset by increased production
at other mines. Investments for mineral exploration and development in PNG steadily declined
in the 1990s from U S $ 83 million in 1988 to U S $ 12 million in 1999 but, supported b y the first
PNG Mining and Institutional Strengthening Technical Assistance Project, have since recovered
to US$ 30 million in 2006. Ok Tedi has a limited life with production ending possibly as early
as 2013. Porgera would likely have another 10-20 years production and Lihir thirty years or
more.

Economic Importance of EI. Extractive industries have always been a major part o f the
formal economy in PNG and in recent years have accounted for about twenty percent o f
government receipts, one-third o f GDP, and about three-quarters o f exports. Copper has
accounted for about half o f E1 exports, o i l about one-third, and gold about one-sixth. With the
present worldwide minerals commodity boom, E1has increased to over 80 percent o f exports and
40 percent o f fiscal receipts in 2006 as shown in Table A - 2 below. Formal employment
provided b y commercial E1projects i s rather modest-about 15,000 jobs, equivalent to 5 percent
o f formal employment in PNG.

Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM). There are an estimated 100,000 artisanal
and small-scale miners in Papua New Guinea, o f which approximately 25,000 live in the area
around Wau and Bulolo, Morobe Province. After agriculture, small-scale mining i s the largest
generator o f rural incomes in Papua New Guinea supporting an estimated 500,000 miners and
family members-thus, close to 10 percent o f the population o f Papua New Guinea derive either
direct or indirect cash benefits from small-scale mining, which i s often the only source o f cash
income available to remote rural communities. Furthermore, the number o f miners continues to
rise as other alternative livelihoods fail to materialize or as infrastructure for market access for
agricultural goods deteriorates. However, the income benefits from the sector must be balanced
against the potentially high environmental and community health costs. The miners in general
have l o w levels o f education and liberally use mercury and occasionally other toxic chemicals
without adequately understanding the impacts on their own health or the general environment.

8.
Sector Organization. There are four main organizations that administer the E1 sector.
O i l and gas are administered b y the Department o f Petroleum and Energy (DOPE), which i s
responsible for licensing, monitoring, and enforcement o f license and contract conditions
including health and safety regulations. The Mineral Resources Authority (MRA) was approved
in late 2005 and established in 2007 and has taken over responsibility for licensing, monitoring,
and enforcement o f license and contract conditions from the old Department o f Mining (DoM).
A newly formed Department o f Mineral Policy and Geohazard Management (DoMPGM) i s
responsible the development o f Mineral Policy and Legislation and for monitoring o f volcanic
and earthquake-related risks. The Department o f Environment and Conservation (DEC) i s
responsible for environmental monitoring and enforcement o f social and environmental
safeguards and programs. The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) i s responsible for income
tax collection and enforcement.
9.
Petroleum Division. The Petroleum Division has limited ability to attract and keep highquality staff, as many are enticed by higher salaries elsewhere. An institutional study was
undertaken in 2003-4 to examine the possibility o f converting the Petroleum Division into a
Statutory Authority o f the Government. A follow-up study in mid-2005 reviewed the
management organizational practices and operational procedures o f the Petroleum Division

Attachment A

34

under DOPE and recommended a detailed action plan comprised o f management training;
corporate and strategic planning; review o f the organizational structure; review of employee
terms and conditions; preparation and implementation o f a performance management system;
revenue, financial, and budgetary system planning and reform; and preparation o f an IT master
plan. This plan was executed, and a proposal to convert the Petroleum Division into a Statutory
Authority was submitted to the National Executive Council (NEC) for i t s policy consideration in
August 2006. A draft bill has been prepared for presentation to Parliament in the event that an
affirmative policy decision i s made by the NEC. Whether or not the N E C approves the transition
to a Statutory Authority, reform o f the staff remuneration package w i l l be necessary to ensure
that the Petroleum Division or i t s successor organization remains a sustainable institution
capable o f providing coherent sector advice to the Government.
The Development Forum. PNG has established i s own unique and highly effective
10.
process for E1 project approval. At the time a license application i s made for mineral
exploitation or o i l and gas production, the development proposal and other key documentation
are circulated to all interested government departments and involved parties (in particular
landowner groups). These documents are then considered at a Development Forum where the
project developer presents the proposed project to all interested parties and departments and,
following due deliberation and resolution o f issues raised b y the various parties, a government
decision i s taken to approve the project (or not) with all conditions specified. The conditions are
then placed in legally binding documents including a Development Contract which i s signed
between the investor and the government for each project as well as subsidiary agreements
between the investor and the landowners regarding compensation, and a multiparty agreement
between the investor, government, and the landowners concerning the sharing o f mineral
royalties, local economic development, etc. Included in these agreements are social and
environmental protection plans.

11.
Environmental Impacts. E1 projects have significant environmental impacts. These
tend to be more severe for mining than o i l and gas because mining causes greater ground
disruption and requires more waste rock disposal than o i l and gas. The most significant mining
impacts in PNG involve the disposal o f waste and tailings at Ok Tedi and Porgera into the local
river system and at Lihir into the ocean. For o i l and gas, the environmental issues relate mostly
to potential o i l spills-at transshipment points or due to pipeline ruptures. There are serious
environmental legacy issues at both the Panguna and Ok Tedi mines, where tailings disposal in
the local river systems w i l l likely involve significant impacts over a long period o f time.
12.
Social Impacts. E1 projects have substantial social impacts, but these have been better
managed in PNG than in many other countries because due to customary land ownership and
usage rights, landowners have both de facto and de jure control over what happens on their land.
Thus, with the exception o f the armed uprising on Bougainville, PNG has avoided the more
severe human rights incidents that have occurred in some other countries. However, local
communities suffer from a number o f negative social impacts including the creation o f “haves”
and “have riots"-the latter typically include the poorest members o f the population (especially
single mothers and children), who often find their gardens and income sources shrinking while
the arrival o f new people for mine employment drives up food costs. Other impacts include the
creation o f shanty areas populated with people who are attracted to mining sites but unable to
find employment; a breakdown in family cohesion and relationship; and unfulfilled expectations
for young people who anticipate better employment opportunities but do not find them.

Attachment A

E1 Project Ownership. All o f the E1 operations in PNG are majority owned and
13.
operated b y private sector investors with the exception of the Ramu nickel project, where the
majority owner and operator i s the Chinese state-owned China Mining and Metallurgical
Company. The GoPNG policy i s to reserve the right to take up a minority share o f the equity in
all E1projects at cost on a contributing basis, and the state has taken a minority shareholding in
most o f the projects. Part o f the state equity has been passed on to landowners and provincial
governments on a carried interest basis. Major international investors and operators include
ExxonMobil (Kutubu oil), BP (Hides gas), and Barrick (Porgera). R i o Tinto was the original
operator at Lihir and BHP the original operator and majority owner o f the Ok Tedi. The Ok Tedi
operation was subject to significant opposition due to i t s negative environmental impacts,
especially for communities downriver o f the mines where flooding was severely damaging
agriculture, forests, and associated livelihoods. In a 2001 agreement with the Government, BHP
placed i t s shares (which comprised 52 percent o f total shares) in trust for the local people in
return for indemnity for environmental and other liabilities. These shares are now held b y the
PNG Sustainable Development Program, Ltd. (PNGSDP). PNGSDP i s responsible for
overseeing the use o f dividends and income for both present and future generations, including
landowners in the vicinity o f the areas o f impact o f the project, the population o f Western
Province, and the population o f the country as a whole according to a contractually defined
formula.
B. E1Development Issues
14.
Macroeconomic Management of E1 Revenues. Countries with large E1 sectors relative
to the rest o f the economy face three main macro economic challenges. The first challenge i s to
use the E1 revenues to develop the non-E1 sector in parallel with the E1 sector and to the extent
possible diversify the economy in order to avoid over dependence on E1 and the risks o f “Dutch
disease.” Over the past twenty years, PNG has not been successful in growing the non-E1 sectors
o f the economy relative to EI. The second challenge i s to manage potentially large swings in EIrelated government receipts relating to the volatility o f commodity prices. Twenty years ago,
PNG had a Mineral Resources Stabilization Fund (MRSF), which was instrumental in partially
cushioning the national level economic impacts o f the closure o f the Panguna mine. However,
the MRSF was discontinued. The third challenge i s to successfully use the income from E1 to
support improved development outcomes including, in particular, health and education. But,
over the past twenty years, health and education outcomes have tended to deteriorate not
improve. At the present time PNG i s experiencing a significant upswing in government receipts
from the world commodity boom. The Government’s policy at present i s to use the surpluses to
pay down i t s international debt, which i s basically a sound policy, providing that adequate funds
are available for the Government’s recurrent budget needs. However, the challenge of
developing the non-E1 sector remains significant. The sound use of E l income to diversify the
economy and improve development outcomes, while at the same time managing volatile income
streams, is a key focus of the Bank’s macroeconomic and development dialogue with the
GoPNG, including the Country Economic Memorandum, the Public Finance Review, and the
Public Expenditure Tracking Survey.

Mitigating Environmental Risks. All o f the E1 operations in PNG operate in
15.
compliance with government regulations and contract terms and conditions, which are generally
based on good international practice with the exception o f the controversial methods related to
waste disposal (i.e. disposal o f mine overburden and concentrator tailings) used at the larger
mine sites. The use o f riverine waste disposal methods at Ok Tedi and Porgera i s generally
considered unacceptable practice today. In the past the substantial harm downriver from the O k
Tedi mine was not well addressed or compensated, but this been recognized and better addressed
in the past ten years and considerable improvement has been made to reduce the down river
impacts through dredging. The present arrangements at both Ok Tedi and Porgera are generally
well accepted b y both the affected landowners and the Government, and preferred to the
alternative o f closing down the operations, which would have severe adverse impacts for the
local communities, the province, and the national economy. Ocean disposal o f tailings and
waste, which i s used at Lihir, i s also controversial, though potentially less harmful than riverine
disposal providing disposal i s undertaken at depth and consistent with best practice. At Lihir, the
alternative would be to have waste disposal sites on land, but the island i s so small that deep
ocean disposal i s preferred by both landowners and the Government. Deep-sea waste disposal
was used at Misima along with regular monitoring b y DEC, and the impacts were considered
acceptable.

16.
Mitigating Health and Safety Risks. With regard to health and safety, there have been
no serious o i l spills to date and the government and the operators have ensured that good practice
pipeline design and safety procedures are in place to avoid any rupture due to technical factors
and to minimize the impacts should the pipeline be damaged b y a sever earthquake or seismic
event. Oil and gas pipelines and other plant and facilities are at r i s k o f explosion but the
Government requires and the companies adhere to strict safety standards in line with good
international practice and there have been no major safety incidents or fatalities. Mine health
and safety standards are also generally in line with good international practice although there was
a major explosion in the explosives preparation plant with loss o f life at Porgera in 1994.
Though mine health and safety inspections were previously inadequate, support for
improvements was provided through the first Mining TA and Institutional Strengthening
operation.
Mitigating Social Risks and Improving Social Impacts. The strong voice o f the
17.
landowners having de jure control over development in their areas, combined with the
Development Forum process, has helped local communities to receive substantial benefits from
the E1 sector. In addition, E1companies have made significant efforts to increase local sourcing
o f goods and services in order to reduce the enclave nature o f the E1 sector as compared to
twenty years ago. This has been achieved partly through the agreements that are signed with
local people, and partly through the recognition b y E1companies that positive relationships with
local communities and outsourcing business to local companies i s not just good for development
but i s also good for business. While communities can gain benefits from EI, i t i s only in the past
decade that the disparities in social benefits and risks between different groups have started to be
well recognized and addressed in PNG. Work on gender issues under the Mining TA project has
identified that men take a disproportionately large share o f the benefits o f E1 projects (in
particular employment, income, and compensation) whereas the bulk o f the social and
women and
environmental risks fall upon those least able to represent themselves-mostly
children. The Mining Women’s Associations ( W A S ) at each o f the main mining sites have

37

Attachment A

prepared five-year Women in Mining ( W M ) Action Plans for 2007-2011 that address the needs
o f women and children. D O M and DoNP have been strongly involved in and supportive of the
W I M Action Plans and have merged them into a National Five Year Women in Mining Action
Plan that has been submitted to and endorsed by the National Executive Committee. The action
plans are now being prepared for implementation b y the MWAs with monitoring and support b y
D o M and DoNP, as well as initial implementation funding from JSDF. There are also women’s
programs at some o f the oil and gas sites. All o f these programs include specific actions to
improve the positive impacts o f mining and reduce the negative impacts for women and families.
The Mining TA 2 operation will support improved benefits and reduced risks of E I operations for
women, children, and youth through support to the DoMPGM Policy Division for finalizing and
issuing its Sustainable Mining Development Policy (which has a strong focus on community level
issues) and through support to the MRA Coordination Department for working with MWAs to
implement the Women in Mining Programs. The Mining TA 2 project will also support the MRA
Coordination Department to develop and implement a strategy and engagement program to
improve the impacts of mining for youth and the MRA ASM Department to improve livelihoods
for youth from ASM.
18.
Mitigating Social Risks: Closure o f E1 Operations. Closure o f E1operations can result
in loss o f income and employment and significant contraction o f the local economy. This
happened at the Misima mine when i t closed, and the Government i s concerned to see the
impacts managed as well as possible at both the O k Tedi and Porgera mines, both o f which may
close within the next decade due to exhaustion o f presently known reserves. The Government
intends to put in place good practice mine closure and oil/gas decommissioning policies
supported b y sound planning and solid implementation procedures. Some initial work on mine
closure was conducted under the first Mining TA, and additional work to support improved
planning and implementation of mine closure activities will be supported under the second
Mining TA operation, including assistance to MRA and DoMPGM for a Misima Mine Closure
Review and to DoMPGM for preparing a Mine Closure Policy to better manage mine closure
impacts.

19.
Sustainable Local Community Development. I f E1 are to make a greater contribution
to development in PNG, then sustainable institutions w i l l need to be established in mining and
petroleum affected communities. The government i s presently considering how E1development
can be better integrated with community-driven development (CDD), and pilot work w i l l be
supported b y the Mining TA 2 project. The community related activities o f the MWAs represent
a practical start and, as part o f i t s support for implementing the Women in Mining Program, the
TA operation will provide support to the MRA Coordination Department to support development
of joint programs by the MWAs and local/district level government agencies.

20.
Improving the Development Impacts of Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM).
A S M brings considerable benefits in terms o f rural incomes but also significant health and safety
risks and environmental harm. The Government, with the support o f a Japanese Social
Development Fund grant, has taken a number o f initiatives including developing training
materials, supporting training and outreach initiatives, and developing a database for the
collection o f basic statistics on small-scale miners b y the newly formed Small Scale Miners
Association (to include exploration, mining and processing methodologies, mercury usage, and
the health and education status of miners and their families) in order to bring more order to ASM

Attachment A

38

and to build the knowledge and capabilities o f the A S M miners so that they can operate in a
more sustainable manner. The project has been successful in taking a holistic approach to the
sustainable development o f A S M communities b y addressing how to increase livelihoods
through improved mining techniques, and b y providing support for addressing education, health,
environmental, and social issues associated with small-scale mining. The new Mining TA will
take this effort further by providing support to MRA’s ASM Department to expand the
availability of information and to expand the reach and scope of technical assistance services,
training and development activities on a pilot basis to other small-scale mining areas in Papua
New Guinea, through support for the newly formed Small Scale Miners Association.

C. E1Governance Issues
E1 Revenue Transparency. The larger E1 operations are all operated in a fully
21.
commercial manner by multi-national mining or oil companies, and the smaller operations b y
well-qualified, competent local companies. All produce and publish financial accounts, and
there i s good transparency regarding payment b y companies to all levels o f governmentalthough there i s little dissemination or public discussion o f such payments and no publicly
available reconciliation of what the companies say they pay with what Government says it
receives. There i s also good transparency regarding transfers o f E1 and other funds by the
national government to provincial governments, which include not only general budgetary funds
but also mineral royalties and special support grants to mineral producing provinces. There i s
little or no indication o f corruption in the minerals sector at the national level. However, there i s
very poor transparency regarding the receipt and use o f funds at the provincial and local
government levels due to lack o f published budgets, lack o f published accounts, and lack of
audits o f sub-national government funds. Improving the transparency of collection and use of EI
funds to support greaterfinancial accountability of E l revenue flows at national, provincial, and
district levels will be addressed through the Bank’s macroeconomic and development dialogue,
including AAA work on public expenditure management which will also support the
Government’s possible participation in EITI.
22.
E1 Licensing. One o f the most important E1 governance issues i s licensing
arrangements. As indicated previously, PNG has a sound system for licensing E1 projects, but
the institutional capacity o f the government in general and both D o M and DoPE in particular has
eroded over the past ten years, and recurrent budgets for D o M and DoPE have been inadequate
to support effective oversight of E1 operations. The establishment o f the MRA i s helping
improve mineral licensing. First, because the MRA i s self-funding from mining sector fees, i t
should be able to attract sufficient staff who have good qualifications and experience (this was a
problem for DoM, which lost some o f i t s best staff to more attractive employment elsewhere but
was held back from filling vacancies b y the Department of Personnel Management) and
sufficient recurrent funding to undertake necessary mine site visits and inspections (which D o M
lacked). Second, the MRA’s governance structure has a clear separation between Board
membership and management, and Board members are appointed b y different constituencies
(which prevents the Board from being politically influenced). A mining administration w i l l also
need to be established for Bougainville. Efforts to strengthen the institutional structure of EZ
sector bodies and their capacity to license and administer the sector (including in Bougainville)
will be supported under the new Mining TA 2 operation.

39

Attachment A

E1 Fiscal Regime and Tax Assessment and Collection. All of PNG’s mining and
23.
oil/gas projects are subject to a common fiscal regime that i s in line with good international
practice, with the exception of the recently approved Ramu Nickel project where a ten year tax
holiday was granted b y the Government. Tax holidays for E1 projects are considered highly
undesirable because they create the risk of distorted production decisions whereby an operator
w i l l maximize production prior to the expiration of the tax holiday, resulting in sub-optimal
development of the ore body and sacrifice of lower-grade resources. The Mining TA 2 operation
w i l l assist DoMPGM in encouraging Government negotiating teams to avoid offering special
treatment through tax holidays. The PNG fiscal regime i s implemented through well designed
tax regulations which are generally well enforced by the JRC, with the important exception that
the JRC lacks sufficient staff and skills to conduct field audits of E1 companies. As a result,
there are missed opportunities for revenue collection from existing mining and petroleum
operations. Some pilot work carried out under the Mining TA project resulted in significant
additional assessments, and i t i s expected that E1tax revenues would increase substantially if the
IRC were able to conduct field audits of all companies lodging income tax returns. Additional
substantial support to build the IRC capabilities to undertake field audits will be provided under
the Mining TA 2.

24.
Distribution of E1 Royalties and Compensation to Landowners. There are significant
concerns about the distribution and use of landowner royalties, with a reported tendency for men
to keep the bulk of the income and compensation for themselves and spend i t on their own
priorities. The situation i s most severe regarding landowner compensation for o i l and gas, which
i s paid to landowners not at the sites near their homes but in Port Moresby, and stories abound of
landowners returning with most of the funds already dissipated on good living in the capital’s
hotels. The Government has not made this a priority, but under the Mining TA 2, support will be
provided to the Policy Division of DoMPGM to improve the accountability systems for transfer
of mining compensation and benefits to landowners.

25.
Rights of People Affected by E1 Projects. As noted previously, there are no known
major human rights abuses or violations associated with E1projects in PNG. Some NGOs have
raised concerns that local people’s views are not sufficiently taken into account by E1 operators,
but this concern has not been raised by landowners per se. T o the extent that there are rights
issues, they largely relate to the impact of E1on women. This i s being addressed through mining
and EI-gender related work as outlined in Paragraph 14 above.

Attachment C: Debt Sustainability Analysis27
1.
This attachment summarizes the debt sustainability analysis @SA) for Papua New
Guinea prepared using the framework for low-income countries. The baseline macroeconomic
scenario underlying this DSA was prepared b y the International Monetary Fund in September
2007 for the 2007 Article I V Consultation mission and envisions a sustained implementation of
the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy. The DSA also assesses the impact o f various
exogenous shocks on the sustainability o f public sector debt and external debt under the baseline
scenario.

A. M a i n Assumptions
a

Real GDP i s projected to grow at about 4 percent in 2007-12 as several mining projects
come on stream, agricultural productivity improves, and continued gradual progress i s
made on structural reform.

a

Monetary policy w i l l be geared toward maintaining low inflation and achieving exchange
rate stability and sound external position.

a

Fiscal policy remains in line with the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy; overall
budget surpluses are expected to decline and turn into deficits by 2010 due to falling
mineral prices and increasing government spending, but the non-mineral fiscal balance i s
expected to be stable.

a

Papua New Guinea would have access to external concessional finance and continue to
follow a prudent debt strategy.

a

Structural reforms outlined under the authorities’ Medium-Term Development Strategy,
including those on public sector reform, are implemented at a gradual pace.

B. Total Public Sector Debt Sustainability
2.
The public sector debt ratio declined from the high of 76-77 percent of GDP in 200102 to 39.2 percent of GDP at end-2006 (Table C-1). This improvement reflects prudent fiscal
policy, favorable mineral sector developments (in particular, strong prices of key export
commodities in recent years), kina appreciation, lower interest rates, and a sustained economic
recovery since the current government took office in mid-2002. External public and publiclyguaranteed debt accounts for just over half o f total public debt. Multilateral debt, primarily to
Asian Development Bank, Papua N e w Guinea’s largest creditor, and the World Bank, accounts
for two-thirds o f external public and publicly-guaranteed debt. Japan i s the main bilateral
creditor, accounting for more than 80 percent o f bilateral debt. Under the authorities’ MediumTerm Debt Strategy, foreign-currenc y loans are considered only if they are highly concessionary
(grant element of 35 percent or more).

27 The following analysis draws on the I M F ’ s D S A analysis prepared for the Mission Brief for 2007 Article I V
Consultations, which are scheduled to be held in November 2007. The D S A was prepared using the IMF-WB D S A
framework for Low-Income Countries.

42

43

Attachment C

3.
Under the baseline scenario, the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio i s projected to
decline to 29.5 percent by 2012 and 14.6 percent by 2027. The projected improvement o f the
ratio stems mainly from the expectation o f a prudent fiscal policy continuing into the medium
term, as well as from favorable automatic debt dynamics. The NPV o f public debt would decline
from around 40 percent of GDP in 2006 to 30 percent b y 2012 and to less than 16 percent b y
2027. The NPV of public sector debt-to-revenue ratio, which has fallen significantly over the
past 4 years due to high windfall revenue, i s expected to rise somewhat b y 2010-11 as mineral
revenue moderates. However, in the longer term the ratio i s expected to significantly decline.
The debt service-to-revenue ratio would similarly rise slightly (from 10.3 to 14.9 percent
between 2006 and 2010) before declining.
4.
The standard analysis indicates that the paths of the debt ratios are particularly
sensitive to changes in real GDP growth (Table C-2 and Figure C-1). A decline in real GDP
growth in 2008-09 by one standard deviation below i t s historical average would raise the NPV o f
public debt-to-GDP ratio by more than 20 percentage points o f GDP in the long term. A onetime 30 percent devaluation in 2008 would also increase the debt burden in the medium term (by
6 percentage points o f GDP within a year), but the ratio would decline over the longer term.

C. External Debt Sustainability

5.
Papua New Guinea’s external public and publicly-guaranteed debt has declined in
recent years, from the high of 52.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 21.4 percent in 2006 (Table
C-3). During the same period, total external debt declined from 76.8 percent o f GDP to 34.0
percent. As a percentage o f exports o f goods and services, total external debt declined from
127.5 percent in 2002 to 41.7 percent in 2006. Based on available data, private external debt
accounted for 37 percent o f total external debt at end-2006 and stood at 13 percent o f GDP.
6.
External public and publicly-guaranteed debt dynamics are sustainable under the
baseline scenario, and Papua New Guinea faces a low to moderate risk of debt distress
~ the key debt indicators (the NPV o f
under the IMF-WB DSA framework for L I C S . ~All
public and publicly-guaranteed external debt in percent o f GDP, the NPV o f debt in percent o f
exports, the NPV o f debt in percent of government revenue, and the debt service to exports and
to revenue ratios) remain within the thresholds and are projected to steadily improve over the
CAS period.29 Only under one bound test (for lower export value growth) i s one threshold (NPV
o f debt-to-GDP) breached (Table C-4).

External debt sustainability i s most vulnerable to shocks resulting in lower export
7.
growth. The decline in export value growth in 2008-09 by one standard deviation below i t s
historical average would raise the NPV o f public and publicly-guaranteed external debt-to-GDP
ratio by more than 20 percentage points b y 2009-10, and the ratio would fall below the threshold
level for the poorly performing countries b y 2020. A one-time, 30 percent nominal depreciation
28 Papua New Guinea i s rated a poor performer for i t s policies and institutions for the purposes o f the IMF-WB LIC
DSA framework. Thus, debt sustainability thresholds applicable to Papua New Guinea are: (i)
100 percent for N P V
30 percent for NPV o f debt-to-GDP, and (iii)
200 percent for NPV o f debt-to-fiscal revenue;
o f debt-to-exports, (ii)
and for debt service: (i)15 percent o f exports o f goods and services and (ii)
25 percent o f fiscal revenue.
29 Private external debt i s also expected to decline over the long term, as large mineral projects that account for a
high proportion o f debt reach completion.

Attachment C

44

in 2008 would raise the NPV o f debt to GDP by 7 percentage points in the first years before
falling over the longer term. Under any circumstances, Papua New Guinea’s external debt
distress risk i s moderated b y the fact that the country has an excellent external repayment record,
having never defaulted in the past.

D. Conclusions
8.
Papua New Guinea has made significant progress in reducing its public debt
burden, but it will need to continue its prudent management of debt over the medium-tolong term in order to mitigate risks to public debt sustainability. Currently, most indicators
show that the public and external debts are manageable, and Papua New Guinea faces a low to
moderate risk o f debt distress. The outlook, however, i s sensitive to changes in real GDP growth
and export performance, highlighting the vulnerability o f the debt dynamics to potential shocks
from lower world market prices o f the country’s key export commodities. This requires the
policy aimed at accumulating sufficient precautionary foreign exchange reserves andor paying
down external debt during the periods o f high commodity prices, and a continuation o f
conservative borrowing policy. T o further help guard against vulnerabilities, Papua New Guinea
should ensure that any external borrowing i s obtained on concessional terms, as envisioned in i t s
Medium-Term Debt Strategy.

Attachment E: Aid Effectiveness in Papua New Guinea
1,
In an effort to improve the effectiveness o f aid in Papua New Guinea, GoPNG and i t s
development partners have drafted a joint statement committing to localize the Paris Declaration.
The “Joint Commitment o f Principles and Actions between the Government and Development
Partners,” drafted in September 2007, sets out a series of shared principles for aid effectiveness
in the PNG context, together with monitorable targets and indicators to measure improvements
between 2007 and 2012. Following i s a brief review o f these elements of the draft statement.
2.
Ownership. Papua New Guinea would define operational development policies b y
leading the development and implementation o f the M T D S through broad consultation and
integration o f development aid into mainstream planning; strengthening i t s leadership role in
coordinating aid at all levels; and inviting non-governmental and faith-based organizations to
participate in these efforts. Indicators o f increased ownership would include a new MTDS, a
mid-tern review o f the current MTDS, increased budget allocations to M T D S priorities,
GoPNG’s adoption o f an aid coordination strategy, and rollout o f Sector Investment Plans.
3.
AZignment. Development partners would align their assistance and dialogue to the
M T D S and related national and sectoral plans. Government and development partners would
establish mutually agreed frameworks to assess country systems, procedures, and performance,
and work to implement and strengthen program-based approaches, including agreement on
government-led policies, strategies, and plans; processes for joint dialogue and decision making;
flexible implementation mechanisms; and consideration o f an expenditure framework covering
Government, development partner, and other funding. With support from development partners,
Government would work to strengthen institutional capacity by integrating capacity building
objectives into plans and strategies; publishing timely, transparent, and reliable information on
budget planning and execution; undertaking reforms that promote long-term capacity
development and accountable, transparent aid management; and committing sufficient resources
to sustain these reforms. Development partners would, in turn, increasingly use Government
systems, as mutually agreed standards for procurement and public financial management are
attained, avoiding the creation o f parallel structures for project management. Indicators o f
increased alignment would include the share o f each donor’s aid expenditures that are aligned to
M T D S priorities, amount o f capacity building assistance, fewer separate Project Management
Units, and stronger procurement and public financial management systems.

4.
Harmonization and SimpZiJication, Development partners would implement common
arrangements and simplify procedures through more joint missions and analytical work;
collaboration with Government in the preparation and use o f core diagnostic reviews;
development o f common arrangements for planning, design, monitoring and evaluation, and
reporting to Government on donor activities using the M T D S Performance Management
Framework and whole-of-government assessment framework (when developed); and
decentralization/delegation o f authority to the country level to the maximum extent possible for
each donor. GoPNG would provide development partners with clear views on their comparative
advantage, aid modalities, and complementarities at the country or sector level; development
partners would operate on the basis o f comparative advantage by aligning support and agreeing,
where appropriate, on which donor would take the lead in a given area. Indicators o f
harmonization and simplification would include the amount o f aid provided through
54

55

Attachment E

programmatic approaches; the on-time submission o f donor budget and expenditure estimates to
GoPNG; the production o f fewer, better, core diagnostic and country analytical reviews;
agreemenuuse o f common project cycle management tools; and the share o f each donor’s
resources managed at the country level.

5.
Managing for Results. Government and development partners would jointly use resultsoriented performance assessment frameworks to maximize effectiveness and manage
implementation o f national strategies and plans. Development partners’ country strategies,
programs, and resources would be assessed according to their contribution to the development
results recorded in these performance assessment frameworks. The indicator o f improved results
management would be the development and use o f an agreed results framework to assess
performance o f the M T D S and sector programs, and the use o f this information in decision
making.
6.
Mutual Accountability. Each year, Government and development partners would jointly
review progress in implementing agreed commitments on aid effectiveness, including progress
on annual action plans and longer-term targets and indicators. In addition, Government and
development partners would identify transparent mechanisms for assessing the quality and
progress o f technical assistance; jointly select and undertake missions; enhance the predictability
of future aid through joint decision making processes and timely provision o f reliable
information on indicative aid commitments over a multi-year timeframe. Indicators o f mutual
accountability would include periodic mutual assessment o f progress in implementing aid
effectiveness principles, and the share o f aid disbursed according to agreed schedules in annual
or multi-year frameworks.

Attachment F: The Bank’s Recent Experience Under the Interim Strategy Note
A. Introduction
1.
The last CAS for Papua New Guinea was prepared in 1999 and covered the period from
1999 to 2002. After this time, a climate o f political instability, economic decline, and
uncertainty in the backdrop o f donor assistance prompted the Bank to issue an Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) in 2005.
2.
The Bank had launched preparation o f a new full CAS in 2002, conducting consultations
with the Government o f Papua New Guinea (GoPNG) and a broad range o f stakeholders on
development priorities and challenges. However, chronic political instability made i t difficult to
sustain dialogue with the Government on the development agenda, and with development
partners on a common assistance framework. Economic and social indicators were deteriorating
rapidly, with per capita income declining from U S $ 970 in 1997 to US$ 510 in 2003. The
resulting uncertainty was compounded b y Australia’s decision in mid-2003 to take a more
proactive role in PNG’ s development, posting Australian personnel in advisory and in-line
positions throughout the GoPNG under the Enhanced Cooperation Program (ECP). I t was
unclear initially how the ECP’s hands-on approach would alter the aid paradigm in PNG. The
GoPNG had produced a Medium Term Development Strategy for 2003-2007 based on three key
objectives: export-driven growth, rural development, and poverty reduction and empowerment.
There were questions, however, as to the degree of country ownership o f this document, as well
as the strategy’s consistency with financial realities and the effective prioritization o f public
investments.
3.
During this time, the Bank’s relationship with the GoPNG was becoming increasingly
strained. The Bank had suspended disbursements under a major operation, the Forestry and
Conservation Project (FCP), in August 2003 due to noncompliance with legal covenants and
national legislation on award o f forest concessions. The loan, which comprised a U S $ 17.36
million IBRD loan and two GEF grants o f SDR 13.31 million each, was eventually cancelled in
June 2005 at the Government’s request, with only U S $ 2.6 million disbursed out U S $ 40
million.30 These difficulties affected the implementation o f some, but not all, o f the Bank’s other
ongoing programs in PNG.
Based on these factors, and on the advice o f the Bank’s LICUS unit, I S N preparation
4.
began in 2003.

B. Objectives and Assistance Program
5.
The I S N was prepared in lieu o f a CAS to guide the Bank’s involvement in PNG for a
period o f 18 months from March 2005 to September 2006, and to enable the Bank to evaluate i t s
longer-term comparative advantage in the country. I t s two main objectives were to: (a) promote
development dialogue and stem the decline in social indicators; and (b) build the foundations for
improved governance and sustained recovery.

Around this time, the Asian Development Bank deferred the release o f the second tranche of a public sector
reform loan because of governance-related concerns in the application o f civil service procedures, especially in the
fisheries sector.

C. Assessment of ISN’s Achievements

7.
The program under the I S N had strategic relevance. A number o f initiatives (including
community outreach, dissemination o f analytical work, policy dialogue, etc.) were successful
and contributed to the implementation o f Government programs. Overall, the ISN succeeded in
promoting development dialogue and building foundations for improved governance and
sustained recovery. However, there were a few areas where achievements fell below
expectations.
What Worked Well

8.

The highlights o f what worked well are summarized below.

(a) FacilitatingDialogue and Debate on Key Development Themes

9.
The Bank focused on community outreach, spreading information about development and
empowering local communities to become actively involved in development programs that
matter to them. The Women in Mining initiative (Box F-1) empowers women to speak out
about how the mining industry affects them and to play a stronger role in planning and decision
making processes. The Youth Open Space Forum brings together “at-risk” young people to
discuss their concerns about development and their views on possible solutions. The Yu Tok
Radio Program provides young people with an opportunity to voice their interests, concerns,
and ideas on the radio. Port Moresby’s Distance Learning Center i s a frequently-used and
powerful tool for communication and outreach. The new Public Information Center, which
Box F-1: Voices for Change - Giving Women a Say in Mining Community Development
“You can’t eat the stones when the mine i s gone,” said Scholla Warai Kakas at a Papua New Guinea’s
Women in Mining Conference, held July 11-14, 2005. Ms. Warai was one o f 140 women from mining areas
across the country who gathered in Madang to voice their concerns about the impact o f mining activities on their
lives and communities.
The Women in Mining initiative grew out o f a recognition that women and children tend to bear the
heaviest social costs o f mining development and closure, but because they often remain outside formal decision
making structures, they have had limited opportunities to speak out about their concerns.
In 2003, the first Women in Mining conference, entitled “Voices for Change,” provided an opportunity for
women with diverse backgrounds and experiences to meet on common ground and talk about how mining
activities have affected them. They discussed the negative impacts, including the disproportionate employment
and social representation o f men, increased workload for women, destruction o f homes and gardens, pollution o f
water sources, alcoholism, violence, and the spread o f HIVIAIDS. They also identified a variety o f positive
effects o f mining activities, such as the provision of housing, micro-credit programs, improved health services,
school scholarships, adult literacy and vocational training programs, HIV/AIDS education, and counseling for
victims o f violence. Together, conference participants developed a vision statement focusing on five themes
they considered priorities for attention, especially from the Government: health and education, economic
empowerment, social empowerment, safety and security, and sustainable artisanal and small-scale mining. This
work was followed up during the 2005 conference, which resulted in the design o f a five-year action plan to
support economic and social development in mining communities.
By giving women a stronger voice in expressing their needs and concerns, the Women in Mining initiative
has empowered women to take action in developing their communities and planning for the future. There i s a
strong sense that women will be the drivers o f sustainable development in PNG, based on research showing that
women are more likely than men to use financial resources for the education and health o f their children. The
greater involvement of women in community development also promises to strengthen the demand for good
governance, both at the local level and nationwide. As such, this important initiative serves as a model for
community-driven development interventions in PNG.

has attracted a good number of partners from the donor community and private and public
sectors, provides access to useful resources on the activities o f the World Bank Group and
development in general. The proposed CAS for 2008-201 1 w i l l support and expand the current
program o f innovative and successful community outreach activities. The follow up work on
Women in Mining, for example, w i l l include a stronger focus on youth. Youth and gender
issues w i l l be mainstreamed in the proposed CAS.
10.
There were also other factors, besides lending and AAA work, that helped turn around
the difficult country relationship issues. These factors included continued engagement with
GoPNG in areas o f interest (such as supporting the new M T D S as i t came on line); introducing
new products such as the Development Marketplace, which focused on youth issues (a major
area o f concern to the Government); improved consultations; avoiding surprises; and treating
Government counterparts with respect.

(b) Completion and Dissemination of Analytical Work on Key Development Themes
11.
The dissemination o f a number o f high quality analytical reports provided an avenue for
continued dialogue with the Government at a time when the Bank’s portfolio was rapidly
dwindling and preparation of new projects was put on hold due to issues surrounding FCP.
Support for the Government’s implementation of the recommendations o f the Public
Expenditure Review and Rationalization (PERR), led b y the Bank and carried out jointly with
AusAID and ADB, takes the form of a continuing analysis and dialogue that i s fully owned b y
the Government. Joint donor missions have continued to attract high-level access to senior
Government Ministers and bureaucrats, even at the time when Bank-country relations were
severely damaged b y disagreements over FCP. Continued PERR Implementation, not originally
in the I S N program but added later at the Government’s request, provides a crucial opportunity
for the Bank, ADB and AusAID to discuss and influence the Government’s macro-fiscal
policies, funding for service delivery, approach to capacity building, and provision o f budget
information to the public. PERR missions have visited PNG twice a year, and, at the request o f
the Government, three times in FY07.
A Public Expenditure and Service Delivery (PESD) tracking study was completed in
12.
2004, based on a tracking survey conducted during 2002. The PESD examined the state o f
school administration and finance, educational facilities, and student and teacher attendance in
hopes o f better understanding bottlenecks to effective service delivery on the ground. A public
workshop on the PESD was held in March 2007. The workshop theme was “Opening Up the
PNG Budget,” as i t focused on how public funds are spent and what information would be
required to better monitor government spending. The issue o f improved transparency for more
effective monitoring w i l l continue to be an area o f focus under the CAS for 2008-201 1.

13.
A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was completed during the I S N
period in 2006. A number o f i t s recommendations have been implemented. Procurement
processes have improved considerably on paper, but improvements in practice w i l l depend on
management signals, stronger rule respect, targeted capacity building and standardized
documentation. The CPAR concluded that the legal and regulatory framework for public
procurement in PNG has improved substantially following amendments to the Public Financial
Management Act (PFMA) in 2003, but the use of certificates o f inexpediency (waivers o f
competitive procurement) remains widespread.
Several guidance documents have been
developed to support implementation of the new regulations, including a Good Procurement

Attachment F

60

Manual and an Operations Manual, but the manuals have not been widely disseminated and there
i s a need for training in their proper application. The CPAR highlighted the importance of
moving forward with the development o f standard bidding documents that are consistent with the
amended legislation and accompanied by clear tender evaluation processes aimed at achieving
efficient use o f public funds. I t would be useful to design the standard bidding documents so that
they can be modified easily to apply to donor-financed contracts. Sustained attention w i l l s t i l l
need to be paid to enforce standards o f procurement and contract execution at both national and
sub-national levels.
14.
A Human Development Sector Review, conducted jointly with ADB and AusAID, was
completed and disseminated widely. This study made a significant contribution to an emerging
consensus in PNG that human development outcomes have deteriorated in recent years, and
service delivery in many parts o f the country i s collapsing despite significant levels o f both
Government and development partner financing. Though the Bank was not supporting any
lending operations in the human development sector during the I S N period, the Government
valued the Bank’s strategic guidance and donor collaboration in the sector.
15.
The dialogue around the Energy Sector Issues/Options report resulted in the Teachers’
Solar Lighting Project (TSLP), a highly successful small scale project that supports alternative
energy in rural areas has substantial potential for scaling up. A National Rural Electrification
Project has also been identified as a result o f the analytical work and subsequent dialogue, and
forms part o f the proposed CAS program for 2008-201 1.
16.
Rural Telecommunications Options Study. In the process o f the ongoing dialogue
with the Government on telecommunications policy, i t was agreed that the Bank would assist the
Government in conducting a study to come up with options for taking telecommunications
services to rural areas even though this activity was not planned under the ISN. The study i s
about to be completed and i s expected to result in support for a public-private partnership in a
Rural Telecommunications operation under the CAS for 2008-201 1.
17.
A GDLN Youth Outreach study has been completed and the report i s being edited for
publication. The report emphasizes the need to involve young people in decisions that affect
them through mechanisms such as youth engagement, curriculum development, and youth
employment. This work w i l l inform the development of a National Youth Integration strategy
and operation under the proposed CAS for 2008-2011.
18.
Sociopolitical Analysis. Recognizing that PNG i s home to a highly diverse population
whose members identify more closely with their local clan or group than with the nation as a
whole, the Bank began to pay greater attention to the sociopolitical landscape and how this
influences development. An informal Political Economy Analysis was prepared. Dialogue has
also been initiated in the area o f state building. This work reveals a number of factors that have
a bearing on the effectiveness o f development programs within the country’s sociopolitical
context. The disjunctions between local perceptions o f legitimacy and authority, and largely
imported national systems, profoundly affect politics, governance, and distribution o f benefits.
In the transfer o f local socio-cultural values to the national political arena, the expectation that
political leaders (“big men”) w i l l distribute benefits to their local group often comes at the
expense o f the broader electorate. Lessons learned from sociopolitical analyses w i l l be
integrated in program design in future operations.

61

19.
Overall, AAA was a useful platform for Bank engagement during a difficult time, but
more work needs to be done to encourage ownership through joint work with GoPNG and other
stakeholders, and to encourage accessibility b y limiting the focus and size o f reports and
disseminating more broadly.
(c) Sub-National and Community-Level Development Support

20.
A Community Driven Development Stocktaking was undertaken with a view to better
understanding the status o f decentralization policy and implementation, the range o f institutions
that are active at the community level in PNG, and the state o f local-level governance. The
Government and other key stakeholders were widely consulted in the process. The report has
provided important background information for the preparation o f the proposed CAS for 20082011. This work led to the adoption in the proposed CAS o f multiple delivery platforms,
through which the Bank plans to work from the top down to strengthen systems for service
delivery at the national, provincial, and local levels, while supporting community-level activities
to encourage bottom-up development. Taking this work forward, emphasis w i l l be on lending
and analytical activities focused on the sub-national level, C D D programs with links to
provincial and district governments, innovative programs for sector-specific service delivery, and
expanded outreach,
21.
In response to weaknesses in public service delivery at the local level, community
development initiatives have stepped in to fill the gap between available services and local
needs. PNG has a long and rich history o f community-level development, supported b y
intermediary organizations such as churches; national and international non-governmental
organizations (NGOs); private sector companies, particularly in the extractive industries; and
bilateral and multilateral development partners. These organizations have come to play a crucial
role in the delivery o f basic services in PNG, especially in remote communities where service
provision i s difficult and costly for the Government.
22.
The donor community has also been active in supporting community-driven development
activities. The Bank made significant progress in a number o f areas. I t has supported local
development projects through the Development Marketplace (DM), a nationwide competition
known locally as Tingim Yut Kompetisen, which demonstrated the enthusiasm among PNG
communities to develop their own solutions to development problems. The first round elicited
enthusiastic response and many high-quality projects.
The Bank i s monitoring the
implementation o f those projects and the results so far are encouraging. A follow-on DM i s
planned for FY08.

(d) Selected Priority Investments and Portfolio Size and Performance
23.
The indicative IDA allocation for PNG during the I S N period was SDR 28 million. One
GEF-supported project (TSLP) and one IDA-assisted project (additional funding for Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation, US$ 37.3 1 million) were approved during this period. Another
project prepared during the period, the Smallholder Agriculture Development Project (SADP),
has been appraised and negotiated and i s expected to go to the Board in early FY08. The
Highlands Highway Project, whose preparation was suspended due to issues surrounding FCP,
was dropped when the Government decided to use i t s own resources following sour relations
with the Bank.

Attachment F

62

24.
Following country relationship challenges and recalibration of the country program under
the ISN, there was no new Bank lending to PNG between June 2002 and March 2007. Two
projects (Mining TA and Petroleum TA) closed and one (FCP) was cancelled. As a result, the
number of projects under implementation fell from six in 2005 to three in 2007 and the volume
of commitments dropped from U S $ 116.7 million to U S $ 72.3 million. At the time, the portfolio
was plagued by difficulties with overdue audits, lack of counterpart funding, and problems with
special accounts.
Portfolio performance improved significantly during the I S N period and after. As
25.
Government revenues improved, counterpart funding, which had slowed down the disbursements
from the Bank’s loanskredits in the past, was no longer an issue. Two out of the five projects
(Gazelle Restoration and Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation) in the portfolio were previously
rated as being at risk of not achieving their development objectives. They have since turned
around, and their status has been upgraded to indicate that they are expected to achieve their
development goals. However, due to their historical performance, the two operations have longterm risk flags against them. The two projects that closed during the period (Mining TA and
Petroleum TA) were rated satisfactory at the time of closing.
The current portfolio i s small, but effective. There are no fiduciary, safeguard,
26.
monitoring and evaluation, counterpart funding, or legal covenant issues facing any of the active
projects in the portfolio. Only the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (RMRP) had
and s t i l l has a slow disbursement flag, However, in spite of the improvements, the portfolio s t i l l
has country record flag over which individual projects have no control. One project, the TSLP,
has been approved since the I S N came into place. Additional funding for the RMRP was also
approved. Another addition to the portfolio was a regional GEF project for Sustainable Energy
Financing, a US$ 9.5 million facility covering Fiji, PNG, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, and
Vanuatu. The SADP i s expected to go the Board in early FY08. With the warming up of
country relations, the portfolio i s expected to grow gradually.

What Worked Less Well
27.
While most aspects of the I S N exceeded expectations, there were a few areas where
planned programs were not fully implemented. Plans to conduct an updated poverty analysis
on the basis of a new household survey and Demographic and Health Survey were not achieved
due to a number of factors. I t was initially envisaged that a new national household survey
would be carried out in support of the work on the Poverty Assessment. However, despite a lot
of preparatory work, an agreement could not be reached with the Department of National
Planning or with other donor partners, especially the ADB, on carrying out such a survey. In
addition, the Bank felt there was a need for additional work on tracking public expenditures and
service delivery. The PESD was planned as part of a special focus for the poverty assessment.
However, as the PESD generated a wealth of information, i t became a stand-alone report, which
was completed at the same time as the poverty assessment in 2004. The most recent household
survey on which estimates of poverty in PNG can be directly based, the 1996 National
Household Survey, i s now more than a decade old and in urgent need of being updated through a
new nationwide survey. This issue w i l l be taken up in the context of the new CAS.

63

Attachment F

28.
Capacity building for community-led development and local governance started on a
small scale, for example through the Women in Mining initiative, but much more remains to be
done in this area. This i s an important focus o f the CAS for 2008-2011, including through the
SADP pilot on local governance and community participation, analytical and operational work
on District Service Delivery and Local Governance, and other interventions to be delivered on
the local platform level.
29.
Efforts to improve the environment for domestic and foreign investment have not
proceeded at the pace envisioned under the I S N . Doing Business indicators compiled b y the
Bank and IFC, and diagnostic work b y FIAS, have identified several critical bottlenecks to
private investment that need to be addressed, including lack o f access to finance for small and
medium enterprises, cumbersome entry processes, and lack o f access to business services.
However, actions to remove the constraints are yet to be taken b y the Government, and security
remains an obstacle to private investment. The IFC’s in-country office was established in 2006
as a first step toward deepening engagement with GoPNG on these issues, and the proposed joint
Bank-IFC CAS w i l l make livelihood improvements, including a better business environment,
one of i t s principal areas o f focus.
30.
The ISN’s intention to mitigate the social effects o f the recession and assist the
Government in tackling the HIV/AIDS epidemic through strategic support to governance and
HIV/AIDS response was not achieved. The analytical work on human development, which
included HIVIAIDS, took much longer to complete than expected. However, the findings o f that
report w i l l inform the Bank’s support to the health sector and the fight against HIV/AIDS during
the proposed CAS.

D. K e y Lessons Learned
A number o f lessons were learned under I S N implementation that would inform the
31.
Bank’s future involvement in the country. These include:
Programs designed on the basis o f high quality economic and sector work and small,
carefully focused TA operations tend to succeed in situations where traditional
investment operations would fail. The TSLP and Mining TA are good examples.
I t takes time to implement governance reforms. As a result, i t i s important to define
realistic goals and time frame for governance and institutional reforms. I t may take a
multi-year effort covering two or three CAS periods to successfully implement farreaching governance reforms that are sustainable; this i s especially true at the subnational level where capacity i s thin.

Development o f a constructive long-term partnership with the Government and other
development partners in pursuit o f development objectives i s essential in a country like
PNG. Though the Bank has been very active in PNG over the past two decades, the
traditional approach o f implementing CAS programs with a time horizon o f three to four
years has not proved effective in stemming the steady decline in PNG’s social indicators
over the past two decades. Thus a new approach i s needed which looks at desired
outcomes over a 15-20 year period, and then sets interim performance targets within the
three- to four-year CAS period to move the country toward i t s longer-term goals. When
preparing a three- or four-year CAS in such an environment, i t should be clear to all

Attachment F

64

parties that the CAS i s the first in a series o f programs over a longer time horizon,
allowing the Government and i t s partners to tackle challenges that can be addressed now,
while making a start on those that need a longer-term perspective.
I t i s important for the Bank to remain engaged in a country through AAA when

circumstances do not warrant investment operations. Keeping up a program o f relevant,
timely, and high-quality analytical work places the Bank in a position of readiness to
respond promptly when the situation changes. In the case o f PNG, the Bank’s continued
presence made i t possible for the Bank to respond quickly to the Government’s request
for additional funding for the RMRP and to restart preparation o f the SADP.
In order to operate effectively in a country like PNG, where political leadership and
priorities can change unpredictably, and sometimes negatively, Bank staff working in the
country should possess a combination o f technical expertise and diplomatic skills. To
some extent, the improving country relations are attributable to this combination o f s k i l l s
on the ground.

Improving communication and community-level outreach, including on the Bank’s role,
in rural areas o f the country and dealing directly with social groups (such as youth and
women’s organizations), i s critical in helping ordinary people appreciate what the Bank’s
work i s all about.

Attachment G: Governance and Anticorruption Strategy
1.
The World Bank Group has recently adopted a strategy for addressing governance and
anticorruption as an integral part of its work on reducing poverty and promoting growth.31 The
strategy aims to help developing country governments identify their own priorities for improving
governance, and implement effective and sustainable programs. Recognizing the importance of
country ownership and leadership, the Bank Group’s engagement w i l l vary by country. The
strategy aims to strengthen, not bypass, country systems, and to work closely with development
partners. The Bank Group intends to engage with a broad range of government, business, and
civil society stakeholders.

2.

I n line with the Bank Group’s overall governance and anticorruption strategy, the Papua
New Guinea CAS includes a number of measures to support GoPNG’s efforts to strengthen
governance as a means to reducing poverty, enhancing growth, and improving service delivery.
At the national level, the CAS w i l l support improved governance and public expenditure
management to promote accountability and transparency in the use of public resources,
especially through the use of country systems for procurement and financial management. Local
level operations w i l l focus on supporting decentralized systems of planning and budgeting-the
poor functioning of which i s a major constraint to effective service delivery.

Ongoing Support for Governance and Anticorruption Efforts in PNG
Assisting GoPNG to improve its procurement system. An action program has been
agreed under the recently completed Country Procurement Assessment Report, focusing
on building the capacity of tender boards and developing standard bidding documents.
Supporting better public financial management through the implementation of the Public
Expenditure Review and Rationalization (PERR) recommendations.
Strengthening the capacity of the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) to improve the
quality of tax audits. The Mining TA Isupported two pilot tax audits of mining
companies, and support for the IRC w i l l continue under the Mining TA 11.
Helping ensure sound governance in the extractive industries. The Bank has provided
support to the establishment of sound mining and oil/gas licensing and fiscal regimes
under the recently closed Mining TA Iand Gas TA.

Proposed Governance and Anticorruption Actions under the CAS
Pillar I:Promoting; and Maintaininp Sound Economic and Natural Resource Management
Support for improved macroeconomic stabilization and fiscal discipline through multidonor dialogue on the PERR, combined with technical assistance, policy notes, and
reports that respond to client needs and address knowledge gaps. A Public Finance
Review and Country Economic Memorandum are envisioned.

Improving the eflectiveness and transparency of budget preparation, execution, and
reporting. The CAS w i l l support efforts to enhance the credibility o f budgeting and
tendering through the multi-donor PERR process and the implementation o f CPAR
recommendations. The proposed Public Finance Review would provide updated
information on processes and practices, including at the sub-national level, and a
proposed Public Expenditure Tracking Survey would shed light on the impediments to
effective public spending at the agency and sub-national levels.
Strengthening institutional structures in the mining sector, with an emphasis on
transparency and sustainability. The Mining TA I1 operation aims to strengthen the
legislative and institutional framework for mining in PNG, including in Bougainville;
build the IRC’s capacity for tax assessment and audit in order to increase tax collection;
support mine closure planning; and help mine-affected communities to manage the
benefits and risks from mining activities (including those to women and youth). The
Bank w i l l support the development o f internal management and governance systems for
the recently-established Minerals Resource Authority, and i s also proposing to support an
institutional vulnerabilities assessment o f the mining sector.
Capacity building to strengthen oversight of the public sector. Under the proposed
Strengthening Institutions o f Oversight and Accountability Project, the CAS would help
enhance the capacity o f the Auditor General, Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee,
and Ombudsman Commission to conduct and evaluate audits and investigations
(including at the sub-national level), as well as the capacity o f the Central Supply and
Tender Board to oversee public procurement. Programmatic support to the law and
justice sector i s also under consideration (in collaboration with AusAID).
Increasing public availability of information to monitor Government performance. The
Bank Group w i l l help GoPNG issue information in a format that can be easily understood
b y the general reader, and w i l l also help civil society organizations absorb and use this
information. This work w i l l be supported through the PERR process and the proposed
SIOA operation. In cooperation with other international partners, the Bank i s promoting
the adoption of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to assist in the
monitoring o f mining and petroleum revenues.

Pillar 11: Promoting and Maintaining Sound Economic and Natural Resource Management
Strengthening partnerships between government and civil society, and within and across
communities. Within the framework o f decentralization reform, the CAS w i l l support
analysis intended to better understand the flow and use o f resources in selected districts.
A District Service Delivery and Local Governance (DSDLG) Project would help
strengthen local governments and would also support service delivery partnerships with
churches and CBOs.
Supporting multi-donor programmatic approaches in the sectors. The Bank Group w i l l
collaborate with development partners on programmatic support to health and education,
in order to enhance coordination, minimize overlaps, and strengthen country fiduciary
systems.

Strengthening GoPNG’s capacity to implement effective, transparent procurement, and to
apply and monitor procurement and fiduciary guidelines systematically;
Providing channels for civil society consultation and participation in the design and
implementation of programs and accountability mechanisms;
Supporting data collection and analysis (including on poverty, health, education, mining,
and the business environment) to strengthen Government and citizen monitoring and
evaluation o f performance; and
Promoting more productive interactions between local governments and local civil
society groups, and ensuring that community development activities strengthen rather
than undermine local government systems.
