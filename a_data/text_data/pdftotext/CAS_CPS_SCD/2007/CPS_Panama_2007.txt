EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In recent years Panama’s economy has experienced spectacular economic growth. Panamanians’
decision to expand the Panama Canal over the next 6-7 years and conclusion o f a free trade
agreement with the United States, are expected to boost and extend economic expansion for
some time. This presents an historic opportunity for Panama to make headway in reducing
persistent poverty and inequality. However, to broaden the base o f potential beneficiaries,
complementary policies that further increase private sector competitiveness and access to
education, skills, innovation and capital will be needed. In addition, the challenges o f reaching
Panama’s poorest go deeper. 90 percent o f Panamanians living in indigenous areas were living
in extreme poverty in 2003, an increasing share. To reach isolated populations, the traditional
approach to social assistance, which relied heavily on universal subsidies, requires rethinking
and inefficiencies in public spending also require attention.

The Strategic Vision articulated by the Torrijos administration (2004-2009) i s responding to
Panama’s development challenges. A fiscal reform package and a pension reform, both passed
in 2005, form part o f an ambitious development strategy which emphasizes fiscal discipline,
transparency and greater efficiency to ensure a sound economic base, accelerate export-led
economic growth, create more jobs and reduce poverty. To lower poverty by one-fifth during i t s
term o f office, the Torrijos administration has prioritized investments in human capital
(including a big effort to modernize education and training) and introduced a flagship targeted
conditional cash transfer program coupled with the continued expansion o f pre-school education,
primary health care and nutrition and basic infrastructure, especially in poor and indigenous
areas.
The Bank was one o f Panama’s major development partners over much o f the 1990s, a period in
which the country made steady progress on structural reforms to open the economy, improve
competition and modernize the state. However, the Bank’s engagement dropped o f f dramatically
between 2000 and 2004 and much o f the previous Country Assistance Strategy (FY99-01) was
l e f t unimplemented. The partnership has been successfully rejuvenated through the program o f
activities that were agreed in the Interim Strategy Note for the Republic o f Panama ( I S N FY0607): portfolio performance has rebounded, the project pipeline has been rebuilt and analytical
work has contributed to robust policy dialogue.
This proposed Country Partnership Strategy (FY08-FY 10) aims to provide selective, demand
driven assistance that deepens the Panama-Bank partnership and helps the Government achieve
i t s poverty and inequality reduction goals during i t s remaining two years in office. The program
i s also set up to provide the new administration (2009-2014) with access to immediate support.
The CPS supports four objectives which are aligned with the pillars and goals o f Panama’s 20042009 Strategic Vision (Table 1).
The CPS has a strong results orientation. It will continue to support Panama to develop i t s
national statistical systems and related to that, it identifies and will track specific outcomes that
the World Bank program i s designed to support. The CPS also emphasizes building capacity in
partner ministries. This i s being done in coordination with the Inter-American Development

1

Bank (IDB). The two banks are working to harmonize procedures with each other and with
those o f the Government, as Government systems and procedures are strengthened with Bank
and IDB support.

The CPS includes a lending envelop o f $390-$465 million over FY08-10. New financing would
be split mainly between Development Policy Lending and seven new poverty-focused
investment projects. Given the breadth of analytical work done under the ISN, the CPS builds indepth sectoral analysis, including in health and education, into loan financed programs as part o f
the emphasis on local capacity building. The program also includes three analytical reports.
Policy notes will be prepared as a tool for informing policy discussions related to the M a y 2009
national elections.
IFC will continue to focus on financial and infrastructure sectors; projects that promote growth in
line with the second CPS objective (promoting broad-based economic growth). IFC will also
look for opportunities where it can add social and environmental value in the extractive industry
sector. IFC will maintain i t s focus on regional-level operators.
Though macroeconomic vulnerabilities in Panama have diminished since Board presentation o f
the I S N - growth has accelerated, debt has fallen as a share o f GDP, and fiscal balances have
improved - the medium-term outlook i s not completely without risks. As elaborated in the CPS,
the strategy takes into account potential risks in three areas: economic, political and portfolio
performance.

Proposed Issue for Board Discussion

I s the application o f the World Bank’s “Strategy for Middle-Income Countries” in this
Country Partnership Strategy an appropriate strategic response to the Government o f
Panama, considering i t s Strategic Development Vision, economic prospects, and the areas in
which the Government has asked the Bank for support.

I.Country Context and Development Challenges
1. In recent years Panama’s economy has experienced spectacular economic growth
averaging over 7.5 percent during 2004-2006. These gains, combined with the country’s rosy
economic growth prospects present an historic opportunity for Panama to make headway in
reducing persistent poverty and inequality. The current administration under President Martin
Torrijos (2004-2009) i s working hard to do just that. In addition to pursuing policies aimed at
broadening the base o f economic activity - including opening trade markets, reducing regulatory
impediments to competition, fostering innovation and giving poor rural farmers the tools to
compete - the Government i s moving on a number o f fronts to increase the effectiveness o f
social assistance. It has launched a conditional cash transfer program, Red de Oportunidudes,
targeting the country’s poorest to break the generational poverty cycle. It i s expanding preschools and basic health care to better prepare poor children for primary school and i s working to
remove the barriers that prevent them from completing secondary school. The Government also
i s making progress in modernizing public financial management systems and institutions, which
have been a drag on efficient delivery o f public programs, infrastructure and services that are
needed both to help broaden the base o f economic activity and to redistribute benefits more
effectively. And, among other initiatives, the President i s overseeing a $50 million a year fund,
from Canal revenues that i s providing basic infrastructure to communities - water, roads, and
even schools - in accordance with their stated preferences.
2.
With a population o f about 3.5 million, a world famous canal, a modern financial center
and a per capita GDP that ranks it as an upper-middle income nation, Panama i s a country o f
stark contrasts. Perpetuated by dramatic educational disparities’ , over one-third o f Panama’s
population was living in poverty in 2003 and 16 percent living in extreme poverty -- evidence o f
very high inequality. Poverty pressures have also increasingly been threatening Panama’s
environmental assets. Panama i s one o f the most biologically diverse countries in the world.
More than 12 percent o f the country’s territory falls within the National Protected Area System.
Yet poverty pressures have pushed the poor to exploit the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor’s
natural resources in unsustainable ways. The impact o f recent growth on poverty levels and the
success o f efforts to help ensure that economic benefits are more broadly shared will be
measured comprehensively in a 2008 living standard measurement household surve (LSMS).
What i s already known i s that unemployment has dropped to historic l o w 3 and the
Government’s policy prescriptions are on target with what has been proven to work against
poverty and inequality in other places.
Growth Dynamics

3.
Panama traditionally has ranked among the faster growing economies in Latin and Central
America, with strong l i n k s to the U S market and world trade dynamics (Figure la). However,
Panama’s economic development also has been characterized by a high degree o f inequality
(Figure 1b) which was exacerbated by protectionist and distortionary policies, including

I

While non-poor Panamanian adults (25 and older) averaged 10 years o f schooling in 2003, poor adult Panamanians
averaged just over 5 years and indigenous adult Panamanians averaged a meager 3 years.
Open unemployment declined from 11 percent in 2003 to 7 percent in 2006.

generous universal subsidies, introduced in the 1 9 7 0 ~ These
.~
measures introduced structural
inefficiencies that have limited productivity gains and meant that growth has mainly benefited
the capital-intensive service sectors. This has put most economic opportunity out o f the reach o f
less skilled members o f society; the country’s poor, including those living in indigenous
communities.
4.
Following a political and
economic debacle that culminated
with the ouster o f General Manuel
Noriega at the end o f 1989,
economic growth rebounded in
the early 1990s as macroeconomic discipline was restored.
The 1994- 1999 Perez Balladares
administration began aggressively
to tackle structural weaknesses. It
proceeded to dismantle the
existing labyrinth o f trade barriers
and price controls and implemented a far-reaching privatization program accompanied by
anti-trust and consumer protection
legislation. Reform momentum
stalled in the early 2000s, however, amid the global slowdown o f
2001-2002 and the divided political environment within Panama.
Progress has since been rejuvenated under the 2004-2009 Torrijos
administration, accompanying renewed strong growth.

In October 2006, Panamani a n s voted in a national referendum
overwhelmingly in support o f
expanding the Panama Canal
through the creation o f a third set
o f locks. Total investment in the Source: World Bank 2002
Canal expansion, excluding those
in ancillary activities, i s estimated to be around 30 percent o f GDP, spread out over six or seven
years. This endeavor i s expected to provide a major boost to economic growth (Box 1) with
direct benefits accruing primarily to the economy’s traditionally dynamic service sectors.
In June 2007, Panama and the United States signed a free trade agreement. Combined with

past advances in economic opening, implementation o f this agreement i s expected to limit the

scope for applying the protectionist policies that have exacerbated the problems o f duality in the
past. However, the benefits o f free trade do not accrue automatically to all segments o f the
economy, especially to those that have traditionally had limited access to economic opportunity.
Complementary policies that further boost competitiveness within the private sector and deepen
access to education, skills and capital will be needed to broaden the base o f the potential
beneficiaries. Such policies would need to include additional measures to reduce bureaucratic
red tape and other regulatory burdens, continue to lower barriers to domestic competition,
improve the skills o f the labor force and other measures to reduce barriers to formal employment,
and increase private sector productivity through investments in innovation and technology
adoption (Box 2).
Box 1. The Panama Canal
Built in 1914, the Panama Canal i s the gateway for over 140 maritime routes worldwide, but to maintain i t s
global importance capacity must expand. Each year more than 12,000 oceangoing vessels (around 30 per day)
transit the 80km long Canal bringing operations close to the capacity limit. So significant i s the Canal to
international shipping that container ships, at least until recently, were built to fit i t s dimensions, known as the
Panamax standard. Recent growth in world trade, however, places higher demand on container vessels and has
led to the development o f the Post-Panamax vessels that are currently too large to transit the Canal.

The “Canal economy”, including spillover effects, i s enormously important for the Panamanian economy
contributing about one-fifth o f GDP and employment. Broadly defined, the Canal system consists o f direct
activities related to the Canal operation, indirect activities including services to container ships in transit, and,
induced activities, such as the Colon Free Zone or the ports, which are a result o f the existence o f the Canal.
These three generated 14 percent o f Panama’s GDP in 1999 and accounted for two percent o f employment
according to calculations by the Panama Canal Authority (PCA). The Canal system also has a substantial
spillover effect on the rest o f the economy (known as the multiplier e f f e ~ t ) . ~The PCA estimated that this
multiplier effect added an additional four percent o f GDP and 18 percent o f employment. The Canal has also
been one o f the most important sources o f government revenue (29 percent o f total) and contributed to 4 1 percent
o f exports.5
Given the capacity constraints o f the Canal, i t s economic importance and expected world trade growth, feasibility
studies commissioned by the PCA concluded that expanding the Canal i s economically sensible. The so-called
‘third set o f locks project’ was overwhelmingly endorsed in a national referendum held in October 2006. At an
estimated cost o f over US$5 billion (almost a third o f GDP), the project will expand Canal capacity through three
components: (1) the construction o f two new sets o f locks, one set each on the Atlantic and Pacific sides; (2) the
excavation o f access channels to the new locks and the widening o f existing navigation channels, and; (3) slight
elevation o f Gatun Lake’s maximum operating level. Capacity will be roughly doubled, as a consequence, and
will allow for the passage Post-Panamax vessels. The project, to be completed by 2014, i s to be financed partly
by toll revenues and partly by PCA borrowing.6
The expansion i s expected to have a strong positive impact on growth and employment and will also yield
considerable advantages for international trade and the maritime industry. PCA estimates suggest that GDP may
grow as much as one percentage point more per year, on average, over the next twenty years because o f the
project. The PCA also expects employment to increase considerably by around 45,000 in 2010 and 252,000 in
2025. Independent estimates by the IMF suggest a more modest employment impact o f around 20,500 in 2010
and 44,000 in 2025.
4

The multiplier effect refers to the dynamic through which the incomes and employment generated by Canal related
activities increase the demand for goods and services produced elsewhere in the economy.

On 26 April 2007, Cabinet approved an increase in the Canal tolls. The new tariff structure implies a ten percent
nominal increase per year on average over the next three years. The higher-than-expected increase reflects an
assertive attempt by the PCA to capture the full economic value offered by the Canal. Higher toll revenue would
reduce PCA borrowing requirements for financing the Canal expansion project.

costs. However, firing regulations
are restrictive by international
standards and minimum wages are high relative to average value added per worker. Moreover, the efficiency o f
Panama’s judicial system i s relatively low, at least in terms o f the monetary costs o f and the time required for
enforcing commercial contracts. These transaction costs may contribute to Panama’s high informal economic
activity (64% o f GDP, 47% o f non-agricultural employment). Other potential culprits o f the high levels o f
informality observed in Panama are associated with governance and regulatory framework issues. Thus, Panama
scores slightly below the L A C average in control o f corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality,
and political stability (Kaufinan et al. 2006). Not surprisingly, according to the World Economic Forum, the
three most problematic factors for doing business in Panama are corruption, an inefficient government
bureaucracy, and restrictive labor market regulations.

The lack o f skills within the labor force i s also considered an impediment. Less schooling does not appear to be
the culprit: Panamanian workers are more educated than their L A C peers, with 8.6 years o f average schooling in
2000, compared to 6.1 years average in L A C and more university graduates. However, Panamanians lag in
technology use. In 2004, personal computer use rates were 5 5 percent behind the L A C average, internet use
lagged by 17 percent and levels o f fixed and mobile phone penetration were also below the L A C average.
Research and development (R&D) spending, a proxy for country innovation, was also below average. In 2002,
Panama spent 0.38 percent o f GDP on R&D, much lower than the 0.57 percent for L A C and 2.5 percent in the
OECD.

Poverty and Inequality

7.
Despite Panama’s locational advantages, i t s dualistic economic structure has historically
contributed to persistent poverty and high inequality. With support from the World Bank,
Panama conducted two living standard measurement surveys (LSMS), one in 1997 and one in
2003 .7 Over that period, overall high poverty levels, measured by individual consumption,
moved l i t t l e (from 37.3 percent to 36.8 percent), while extreme poverty declined from 18.8
percent to 16.6 percent. Fortunately, these weak results are unlikely to be a good indicator o f
recent progress in poverty reduction. The 2003 L S M S was conducted just as Panama was

patterns and well being o f household members. It i s statistically representative for populations living in urban and
rural non-indigenous and indigenous areas.

beginning to emerge from a two-year economic slump.* O f more interest are the striking
changes in the composition o f Panama’s poor
between
those years. In 1997, the majority o f

indigenous rural areas, while 35 percent lived
in indigenous areas and only 9 percent in
urban areas. By 2003, the share o f extreme
poor
living in rural non-indigenous areas fell,

while the proportion o f extreme poor living in

42 percent. Over the same period, the share o f
extreme poor living in urban areas almost doubled to 16 percent, due at least in part to migration
from rural to urban areas. With the allure o f the Panama Canal expansion project, migration to
Panama City may well increase; 57 percent o f the poor are less than 20 years old and 36 percent
are adults o f working age (20-60).

8. By 2003, almost all Panamanians living in indigenous areas were poor (98.4 percent), with
90 percent living in extreme poverty.’

Poverty was also much deeper among

Because consumption levels are so

essence, what i s emerging i s a three1997

Panama’s threefaceted economic structure: those with access to the dynamic service sector
(urban residents), those who depend on less competitive, lower growth sectors like agriculture
(rural non-indigenous residents) and those who are geographically isolated from economic
activity (comarca residents). Even as progress i s made in increasing the dynamism o f sectors
previously held back by protectionism and regulatory rigidity, those living in isolated indigenous
comarcas areas may s t i l l be left behind.

* According to Panama’s national accounts data, GDP per capita grew by an annual rate o f 1.5% while consumption
as measured in the household survey fell by 0.7%. Such differences between national account data and household
survey findings are common as the instruments are measuring different things and both are subject to error. For a
fuller discussion, see the forthcoming Poverty Assessment.
Indigenous people in Panama comprise just under 10 percent o f the population. The peoples belong to seven
groups o f varying size. The three most numerous have obtained demarcated semi-autonomous comurcus: NgobeBugle near the border o f Costa Rica, Kunu in the San Blas archipelago, and Ember-Woonun in Darien near the
Border with Colombia. Other major ethnic groups include people descended from Spanish settlers and AfroPanamanians, though estimates put those o f mixed heritage at 85-90 percent.

Panama made progress on reducing consumption inequality between 1997 and 2003. The
Gini coefficient for consumption declined from 48.5 to 46.9,'' but it remained above the average
for Latin America and was high by global norms, especially among countries o f similar wealth
levels. The differences in consumption among various groups o f Panamanians were also s t i l l
widespread in 2003. People living in non-indigenous rural areas consumed less than half o f their
urban counterparts, while those living in indigenous areas consumed nine times less (Figure 3).
These economic differences are mirrored in other social indicators. Slightly more than one-fifth
o f all Panamanian children were chronically malnourished in 2003, with the level reaching over
half for indigenous children. In education, while education attainment for the population aged 25
or older was 8.6 years at the national level, it was only 3.7 years and 3.1 years among the
extreme poor and those living in indigenous areas. Primary enrollment rates are rising among
the poor to close the gap with the non-poor, but less than one third o f extremely poor children
were enrolled in secondary school in 2003, compared with one-half o f poor children and 85% o f
non-poor children. The trends and disparities in social indicators are reflected in the progress
and likelihood o f Panama's achieving the Millennium Development Goals (Box 3).
Box 3. Panama: Progress and Prospects for MDG Attainment
Panama i s making good progress toward meeting M D G goals on education, water and sanitation and longer term
trends in poverty reduction. Extreme poverty was cut nearly in half between 1991 and 2002, approaching the
M D G target. The poverty trend measured through 1997 and 2003 L S M S s was less reassuring (extreme poverty
decreased from 18.8% to 16.6% over those five years using a national consumption-based poverty line), but the
recent economic boom i s likely to be picking up the pace o f poverty reduction once again.
Net primary enrollment increased from 92.1% in 1997 to 93.9% in 2003, and the ratio o f girls to boys was 95%
for primary and 105% for secondary education. On pace with M D G goals, more people have access to an
improved water source (88% in 2004, up from 79% in 1990) and improved sanitation (53% in 2000, up from 44%
in 1990). Prospects also look promising for the M D G on halting forest degradation as trends are among the
lowest in the region: total forest area decreased only from 58.8% in 1990 to 57.7% in 2005.

However, Panama has not yet succeeded in making sufficient progress on health indicators. The percentage o f
chronically malnourished Panamanian children grew from 14% in 1997 to 21% in 2003 (and to over 50% in
indigenous areas). Maternal mortality per 100,000 live births also climbed in Panama from 55 in 1990 to 160 in
2000. Panama was able to achieve about a 30% reduction in child and infant mortality from 1990 to 2004, but the
pace o f achievement lagged behind the 40% average reduction seen across Latin America and the Caribbean.

Public Spending and Social Assistance
10. Public expenditure inefficiencies in Panama have helped perpetuate inequality and will
need attention for Panama to more fully capture the potential benefits o f freer trade. Panama's
persistent inequality and the depth o f poverty among many o f the extreme poor argue for a more
effective redistributional role o f the state. In addition, the private sector relies on the state for
providing and maintaining infrastructure, educating the workforce, supporting innovation, and
regulating efficiently - all important factors for maintaining domestic competitiveness. For
Panama it i s less a question o f spending more on social programs, but o f spending well. Panama
spends 17 percent o f GDP in the social sectors, above the Latin American average o f 14 percent,
but outcomes are not commensurate with the level o f investment, pointing to inefficiency. In
lo
The Gini coefficient i s a measure o f inequality o f a distribution o f income. It i s defined as a ratio with values
between 0 and 1 where 0 corresponds to perfect income equality (i.e. everyone has the same income) and 1
corresponds to perfect income inequality (i.e., one person has all the income, while everyone else has zero income).

6

areas o f infrastructure provision the most important challenges are negligence in managing
public assets; weak pricing and cost recovery policies; and inadequacy o f maintenance
expenditures in all the state-managed assets.

11. Underdeveloped tools and systems for strategic planning, resource allocation, and
monitoring have limited the impact o f social, infrastructure and agriculture spending. For
example, while Panama’s education and health indicators are fairly good for the amount o f
public spending devoted to these sectors, those same social sector outcomes could be achieved at
a significantly lower cost by following best practices applied in other countries. In addition to
mechanisms to allow for a more strategic use o f funds, the 2007 Panama Country Financial
Accountability and Procurement Assessment Report (CFAPAR) indicates that better practices
should include modernized public financial management and procurement regimes;
inefficiencies o f these regimes have contributed to higher costs for observed results in all types
o f government spending.
12. Finally, a stronger redistributional role can only be achieved with better targeting o f social
assistance. Panama spends about 1% o f GDP annually on universal subsidies including price
subsidies for electricity, cooking gas and piped water, luxuries that most poor do not enjoy. At
the same time, until recently, few social programs systematically targeted the poor. The
shortcomings o f weak targeting are illustrated by the huge income-group disparities among
social sector indicators discussed in paragraph 9. As progress i s made through Panama’s
targeted conditional cash transfer program (Red de Oportunidades) and extremely poor children
stay healthier and complete primary school in greater numbers, increased attention will need to
be given to secondary education completion, where challenges are even greater. While 60 and
35 percent o f new urban and rural adults completed secondary school in 2003, only 10 percent o f
the indigenous in the same cohort were able to make that achievement. Panama, thus, has the
opportunity to achieve more effective public sector interventions by developing and employing
tools for more strategic use o f public resources, modernizing public financial management
institutions and practices, and by careful targeting o f social assistance.

Summary of Development Challenges
13. As documented in the World Bank’s recent Flagship Report for Latin America and the
Caribbean, Poverty Reduction and Growth: Virtuous and Vicious Circles, in the long-run all progrowth policies will lead to lower poverty; however, in the short-run, when severe inequality i s
not addressed, the poor will benefit less and some not at all. The report finds that high poverty
levels are also a steady drag on growth. The findings o f another recent report, Economic Growth
in the 1990s (World Bank, 2006), concurred: the most successful growth experiences had four
things in common: rapid accumulation o f capital, efficient resource allocation, technological
progress and a sharing of the beneJits of growth. According to the draft Panama Poverty
Assessment: Toward Effective Poverty Reduction (PA forthcoming in 2007) these general
findings are also applicable to Panama. As discussed in the next section under “medium-term
economic outlook”, the expansion o f the Canal and the prospects o f an FTA are bound to boost
economic growth for some years to come. While future strong economic growth in Panama
cannot be guaranteed and continued efforts to realize growth projections will be needed,
Panama’s “unequal distribution o f growth benefits” stands out as the country’s greatest

7

development challenge. As one small-scale farmer put it during informal consultations with
Bank staff, “there are two Panamas: the Canal and us.” For all Panamanians to participate and
benefit from the expected growth generated by the Canal and free trade agreement, the poor will
need greater access to assets o f all kinds: land and capital will be important, but also training,
access to markets, risk sharing and, perhaps most importantly, healthy and well educated
children.

14. As described in the next section, a major focus o f the current administration i s dismantling
the divide between those who have benefited from the “Canal system” and those who have been
a part o f the other Panama. The administration views this as a critical element o f i t s social
contract with the nation to expand the Canal: If funds equal to about one-third o f GDP are to be
invested in the Canal, an equivalent effort i s needed to enable Panama’s poor to become better
off.

11. Government Strategy and Economic Outlook
15. The Strategic Vision articulated by the Torrijos administration (2004-2009) responds to
Panama’s development challenges and gives renewed attention to poverty reduction. President
Martin Torrijos assumed office in September 2004 with a strong political mandate that gave his
party’s coalition a majority in the Legislative Assembly. Within six months o f taking office, the
Government secured passage o f a fiscal reform package and a politically difficult pension
reform. l1 These measures form part o f an ambitious medium-term development strategy,
Strategic Vision of Economic and Employment Development Toward 2009, which was unveiled
by the Authorities in early 2005 (Box 4). Building on the structural reform process that was
suspended after 1999, this strategy emphasizes fiscal discipline, transparency (Box 5) and greater
efficiency as crucial elements for ensuring a sound economic base, accelerating export-led
economic growth, creating more jobs and reducing poverty. The Torrijos administration has set
an ambitious goal o f lowering poverty by one-fifth during i t s term o f office and has prioritized
investments in human capital (including a big effort to modernize education and training) and
targeted social assistance (including the introduction o f a flagship targeted conditional cash
transfer program and the continued expansion o f pre-school education and primary health care,
especially in poor and indigenous areas) as hallmarks o f this effort.
Box 4. GOP Strategic Vision o f Economic and Employment Development Toward 2009
The Strategic Vision i s comprised o f five pillars:

-

Pillar I Reduce Poverty and Income Inequality encompasses four dimensions: stimulate growth and expand
employment opportunities, especially for youth; build human capital o f the poor; pioneer a flagship conditional
cash transfer program (Red de Oportunidades) which brings together efforts to improve education, health,
nutrition and basic infrastructure access targeting the poorest areas; and invest in productive activities in rural
areas, including land tenure security
Pillar I1 - Foster Economic Growth and Employment focuses on efforts to open the economy to international
competition and promote export-led growth, including through free trade agreements, development o f export
infrastructure (roads, ports, etc.), removal o f distortions and unfair sector incentives, and targeted
complementary investments in Canal expansion, irrigation, and urban transport.
Pillar I11 - Reform Public Finance includes actions to reduce public debt, achieve fiscal sustainability and
modernize public financial management, including fiscal and pension reform; measures to improve the accuracy
and transparency o f national accounting systems; modernization o f procurement and tax administration; and
improvements in budget management.
Pillar I V - Develop Human Capital seeks to improve the competitiveness o f Panama’s labor force and reduce
poverty and inequality through investments in education and health. Initiatives will support national curriculum
reform, expanded coverage o f preschool and secondary education, effective worker training, preventative and
occupational health and nutrition programs, and expanded health, water, and sanitation infrastructure in rural
and indigenous areas.
Pillar V - Reform and Modernize the State supports activities to help the public sector and public institutions
become better facilitators o f countrywide development. Measures will be taken to reduce corruption, improve
private participation in infrastructure, increase competition in the electricity and transport sectors, and foster
decentralization o f service-delivery.

These measures were supported by the FY07 Public Finance and Institutional Development Policy Loan ($60
million).

Box 5. GOP i s Increasing Transparency and Accountability to Reduce Corruption and Improve
Public Sector Efficiency
During his inaugural speech (September 2004) President Torrijos announced that fighting corruption would be a
priority during his tenure and from the start his administration recognized the need to strengthen public
institutional foundations and ensure transparency as essentials to creating an economic growth environment that
could eventually move Panama to developed-country status. This priority i s reflected in Pillar V o f the
Government’s Strategic Vision: Reform and Modernization o f the State, which includes a multi-faceted program
to improve transparency and fight corruption o f public institutions and finances. This program calls for
strengthened public ethics; integration o f good governance principles o f transparency, integrity, and
accountability into public operations (through financial management and procurement modernization); and
simplification o f key business procedures. Specific measures taken by the Government in each one o f these areas
follows.
To strengthen transparency of Government operations and create a more open civil service culture the
Government has: (i)abolished regulations to the Transparency Law that imposed restrictions on, rather than
facilitated, public access to information; (ii)approved a law ratifying the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption; (iii)created the National Anticorruption Council, and i t s Executive Secretariat, as an advisory body
to the Executive Branch on public sector strategies related to good governance, transparency, ethics and
anticorruption; (iv) issued regulations establishing general principles for the standardization o f codes o f ethics
within the central government, and the adoption o f such codes in a number o f public entities; (v) established a
financial disclosure program for public sector employees; and (vi) presented a draft law protecting
whistleblowers.
To improve fiscal transparency and public financial management accountability, the Government has
introduced several measures: (i)upgrading tax information systems (e-Tax) and fostering on-line presentation o f
income tax returns, coupled with an awareness campaign and user training programs; (ii)timely issuance and
publication o f budget documentation, budget execution reports, financial statements, information on debt and
payroll, and other fiscal data; (iii)reduction o f the stock and time taken to pay accrued expenditures; and (iv)
implementation o f a document tracking and management system (SIGUEME) to enhance accountability and
performance in financial transactions.
Steps to modernize public procurement include: (i)issuance and implementation o f improved Procurement
Law and regulations; (ii)
stronger mandate and support given to the regulatory body (DGCP) in the context o f an
inter-institutional coordination effort; and (iii)roll out o f the new e-procurement system (PanamaCompra) that
promotes transparency and competition in public procurement (all central government procurement notices are
now being published in the system).
To reduce business red tape and stem opportunities for squeezing private companies, Government has pursued
the following: (i)creation and operation o f the Presidential Secretariat for Governmental Innovation (SPIG); (ii)
roll out o f an internet portal “Panama Tramita” where information i s provided on all the government
administrative procedures identified by SPIG; (iii)implementation o f five electronic one-stop-shops or interinstitutional internet portals, in which high priority administrative procedures can be performed and information
can be obtained about the status o f those procedures that are s t i l l not available on-line; (iv) creation of
mechanisms, through “Panama Tramita,” to allow users o f Government services to file complaints; and (v)
passage o f the “Panama Emprende” Law, which simplifies the procedures for starting new businesses.

Medium-term Economic Outlook

16. Panama’s economy emerged fiom a slump in 2003 and has been booming since then, with
growth rates averaging over 7.5 percent during 2004-06 (Table 2). This boom has been led by
exports o f goods and services, which benefited fiom a worldwide recovery o f trade during this
period, and has been accompanied by strong private consumption and investment demand. From
a sector perspective, the economic recovery has been led by construction, transport and

10

commerce activities, and most recently by an incipient recovery in financial intermediation.
Two sectors that have not exhibited significant signs o f recovery since 2002 are agriculture
(excluding fisheries) and manufacturing.

17. During the initial phase o f this boom, fiscal balances exhibited a deteriorating trend. The
overall public sector fiscal deficit reached an alarming 4.9 percent o f GDP in 2004 and raised
Panama’s public debt to 66.1 percent o f GDP, triggering new concerns about the country’s future
debt sustainability. l2 This decline primarily reflected a deterioration in the finances o f the
central government and o f the Social Security Institute (CSS), and was mostly due to declines in
revenues. Then, a major fiscal correction took place in 2005, reducing the overall fiscal deficit
to 2.6 percent in 2005 to near overall balance and a positive primary fiscal balance in 2006.
While part o f this fiscal adjustment reflected a rise in revenues induced by the strong economic
upswing, a considerable part was due to the change in policy parameters, as the Torrijos
administration moved quickly to restore fiscal stability (through fiscal and pension reform
measures) l3
and reintroduced a broad reform agenda.
l2Considering that almost all o f this debt i s on market terms, Panama i s ranked as one o f the most highly indebted
countries in Latin America.
13
Tax revenues rose by 3 1% in 2006, or much faster than the growth o f GDP, reflecting the impact o f the 2005 tax
reforms and improvements in tax administration. The pension reform, in turn, halted the financial deterioration o f

11

18. Economic growth in 2007 i s projected to be 8.5 percent, led by the ongoing boom in the
construction, commerce and tourism sectors, and fueled by significant capital inflows. As the
current dynamism o f the real estate markets wanes, investment activities associated with the
Panama Canal expansion are expected to take over as the main driver o f growth, together with
new private investments in complementary activities.
Earlier background analyses
commissioned by the Panama Canal Authority estimated that the Canal expansion would raise
economic growth by roughly one percentage point over the next 25 years. In parallel, the free
trade agreement with the United States should gradually begin to exert an effect in terms o f
encouraging export development and foreign investment in productive activities. Based on these
developments, GDP growth i s projected to average around 8.1 percent through 2010 (Table 2) with a trajectory that peaks in 2008 and falling gradually thereafter reaching 7.1 percent in 2010.
Nevertheless, the medium-term outlook i s s t i l l subject to risks as explained in paragraphs 50-55.
19. A debt sustainability analysis carried out by the World Bank in early 2006 under fairly
conservative medium-term growth projections had concluded that Panama's consolidated public
debt, which stood at 66.1 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2005 (down f i o m 70.4 percent in 2004),
i s sustainable (in the sense o f placing the public debt ratio on a steadily declining trajectory) if
the Government i s able to maintain a primary fiscal surplus o f 1.6 percent o f GDP. Under the
current macroeconomic settings, with growth well above the 4 percent used in baseline
simulations and with the primary surplus well above 1.6 percent, Panama's debt ratios are
projected to decline much faster than previously anticipated. These positive projections are
broadly shared by IMF staff in the last Article I V consultation report (January 2007), which
estimated that with the current policy framework, the consolidated public debt would fall to
about 55 percent o f GDP in 201 1 (46.5 percent excluding the estimated PCA debt). (See Annex
2 for more details)
20. A frequently raised question in t h i s context i s whether Panama's sovereign debt rating will
be adversely affected by the proposed Canal expansion project. It should not be. The authorities
have excluded the balances o f the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) from the public sector fiscal
accounts and have indicated that they do not intend to provide sovereign guarantees for any debt
that may be issued by the PCA to finance part o f the Canal expansion project.14

the Social Security Institute, which reported a small surplus in 2006 and whose finances are projected to improve
further over the next few years.
l4 However, one cannot discard the possibility that in a hypothetical worst-case scenario an implicit government
guarantee would be called, given the Canal's strategic importance for Panama's economy. While this could
potentially create a source o f fiscal vulnerability, the lack o f a perceptible capital market reaction to the government
announcement in June 2006 o f intentions to proceed with the Canal expansion project, suggests that the markets
view any potential increase in fiscal vulnerability as negligible. The PCA has established a long track record o f
financially sound and profitable business operations, and preliminary estimates indicate that the net surplus currently
generated from the Canal operations (net o f toll fees and dividends transferred to the central government) are enough
to service the increase in PCA debt currently envisaged under the Canal expansion project.

4). In response to the new administration’s interest in
the Government o f Panama’s priorities and World Bank services, a demand-driven 24-month

which helped inform other activities,
including a development policy loan, three poverty focused investment projects, and several
ongoing lending operations (Annex 2 elaborates areas o f Bank involvement). The Bank
determined that it would be premature for it to associate the modest level o f activities proposed
in the I S N with the wide-ranging medium-term development targets o f the Government. So the
I S N indicated that i t s success would be judged in terms o f “the timeliness o f the analytical work
and quality at entry o f lending provided, the relevance o f Bank services to the Government’s
development strategy and policy formulation, the performance o f the Bank’s portfolio, and the
Government’s interest in a continued partnership with the Bank.” (p. 21 o f the ISN).
23. The success o f the I S N has been reviewed in light o f the criteria it set forth. The quality,
timeliness and strategic relevance o f I S N analytical reports were assessed by the World Bank’s
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) through a “Country AAA Assessment” that was completed in

13

April 2007.15 The three investment projects were prepared. None has been formally reviewed
for “quality at entry” by QAG; however, all received high marks on quality from internal
reviewers and also from Government counterparts. The performance o f the portfolio has been
assessed using standard indicators, including project ratings and disbursement performance.
From the Government’s perspective, the I S N has contributed to some o f i t s most important
policy and program initiatives. This section reviews progress made under the ISN, discusses
what worked well and what worked less well, explores lessons and the Bank’s comparative
advantages and notes the other development partnerships supporting Panama.

24. The I S N activities have been supporting key elements and programs o f the Government o f
Panama’s five pillar strategy to help achieve i t s poverty and inequality reduction targets. Table 3

non-lending activities have contributed. (Annex 2 elaborates on sector challenges, Government

What Worked Well

25. Performance o f projects, under implementation improved dramatically during the I S N
period. Credit can be given to World Bank and Government teams for acting on the lessons that
were identified in the I S N (see Table 4). Disbursements hit all time highs16 as GOP counterparts
worked with Bank supervision teams to uncover sources o f delays in procurement and financial
management processes, concurrent with prioritized attention by the Government to improve the
transparency and efficiency o f these systems. Systemic issues uncovered at the project level fed
back into policy discussions with the Government, as well as the comprehensive CFAPAR which
was jointly prepared by the World Bank and IDB. Bottlenecks and inefficiencies were being
dealt with simultaneously at the project and the policy level. Lending i s again increasing. The

policy impact was enhanced because o f their strategic coherence. The Q A G Country AAA
Assessment for Panama gave high marks to the I S N analytical work for “strategic relevance” and
“coherence and integration”. l9The common and inter-related themes o f the analytical work that
was undertaken were well integrated and brought significant coherence and integration to the

quality” and “likely impact” and the program’s overall “internal quality” and “likely impact” was
judged to be satisfactory. Q A G noted the central role the analytical reports played in shaping the
lending operations; including underpinning the policy dialogue for the Public Finance and
Institutional Development Policy Loan (DPL). Q A G also commended the significant technical
assistance that took place during preparation o f several reports which contributed to the design o f
emerging programs and legislation, including the Red de Oportunidudes and the procurement
law, among others.
27. At the end o f the day, the success o f the I S N i s best judged by the Government’s interest in
continuing i t s partnership with the Bank. The Government has asked that the program continue,
that annual lending be increased and that the Bank expand i t s presence by opening a country
office in Panama. In particular, the Government has praised the responsiveness o f the Bank to
the administration’s development strategy and the contribution o f analytical and technical
assistance from the Bank.

What Worked Less Well
28. Knowledge generated from World Bank supported activities was not well disseminated
“Consultation, participation and
outside Government circles during the I S N period.
dissemination” received the lowest mark from QAG, obtaining only a “moderately satisfactory”
rating. The Bank agrees that while most aspects o f the I S N program exceeded expectations, the
I S N consultation strategy f e l l short. That said, the potential for greater dissemination in the
future i s promising. During consultations on this new CPS ,the authorities indicated their interest
in publication o f all completed I S N reports by September 2007.

Development Partners
29. I n recent years, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Agencies o f the
United Nations have been Panama’s most active development partners, complemented by
modest, targeted support from a few bilateral aid agencies (Annex 3). Panama’s partnership with
IDB represents the largest donor assistance package, with an active portfolio in early 2007
comprising 28 loans with commitments o f US$865 million o f which US$403 million was
undisbursed. The IDB i s active in multiple sectors to help boost country competitiveness,
develop human and productive capital, and strengthen governance and transparency, including
help to build modern public financial management institutions. Activities supported by the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Panama target democratic governance,
poverty reduction, energy and the environment, crisis management, and HIV/AIDS. The Andean
Development Corporation (Corporacidn Andinu de Fomento, CAF) has directed i t s support to
road infrastructure projects, including a US$80 million loan in 2005 to widen the road between
Arraijan and Chorrera and rehabilitate a portion o f the Transisthmian Highway. Bilateral
assistance has been more modest. Recent grants from JICA and USAID have supported
agricultural development, improved monitoring o f water quality, watershed conservation, anticorruption programs, free trade, and indigenous communities. Since 2001, the European Union
has also provided limited aid to strengthen Panama’s economy, promote democratic institutions,
and support social development.

Box 7. Lessons and Recommendations from the Quality Assurance Group (QAG)
The Q A G Country AAA Assessment identified several lessons which can be grouped into three main points:
J

A long-term view o f the relationship with the client i s needed. The Bank should aim to maintain a
presence in the country through AAA even during periods o f less active partnership, including cyclical
reductions in demands for financing. In this way, the Bank will be ready to provide financial assistance
promptly, should the need arise.

J

Engaging a client like Panama requires balance between technical expertise and diplomatic skills to avoid
the impression o f “imposing solutions” that may alienate the client. The dialogue with Panama should be
seen as a dialogue o f equals, incorporating the views and priorities o f the country. The partnership
strategy and programs may need to be revisited frequently to maintain their relevance.

J

Reports should include two page executive summaries on the conclusions and recommendations to make
them more accessible to Ministers and other senior policy makers.

Based on i t s extensive in-country consultations assessing the Bank’s AAA program, Q A G proposed the following
priorities for analytical work under the new CPS: (a) an analysis o f urban development requirements for the
Panama City Metropolitan Area, particularly as they relate to the orderly development o f Panama City and its
relationship to the urban poor; (b) sector and analytical work intended to identify solutions needed to strengthen the
quality o f education; (c) sector analytical work to identify options on how best to integrate the health services o f
the Social Security Institute and the Ministry o f Health; and (d) preparation o f a set o f Policy Notes for the
incoming 2009 administration.

30. The World Bank together with the Inter-American Development Bank and the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have employed an array o f approaches to
complement and collaborate with each other. For example, The IDB and the Bank are
supporting the Panama National Land Administration Program (PRONAT) through joint land
administration projects operating out o f same government project coordination unit under
common technical standards. Both institutions are supporting land titling and regularization, but
in distinct geographic areas. In addition, the IDB i s more involved in big city urban land policy
issues and the Bank more in rural and protected area land policy. Another area o f close
collaboration has been in support to the Red de Oportunidades where the Bank and the IDB are
providing parallel financing using harmonized fiduciary, procurement, and monitoring and
evaluation systems. Joint preparation missions led to harmonized project designs and the
synergistic realignment o f ongoing IDB operations in health and education. The Bank and the
IDB also jointly prepared the 2007 CFAPAR with technical assistance provided by both agencies
under ongoing TA loans (each covering different beneficiary agencies). For the 2007 Poverty
Assessment, the Bank worked closely with UNDP to harmonize policy recommendations and
poverty assessment methodologies and indicators.

The IMF conducts Article I V reviews on a one year cycle. The last review was discussed
by the Fund’s Board on February 16, 2007. The IMF provided comments on review drafts o f
analytical repots and the Public Finance and Institutional Development Policy Loan (FY07).
31.

World Bank Potential Added Value
32. The Bank has the potential to add value in Panama based on i t s historical involvement in
particular sectoral areas in the country and also from i t s knowledge and experience in the region
and globally. The Bank has a strong reputation for the quality and relevance o f analytical work

17

and technical assistance and it has established a recent strong track record o f proactive
supervision that has supported building local capacity. Table 5 identifies sectoral areas in which
the Bank has supported Panama in some significant way between 1990-2006 (these are also areas
where the Bank brings significant experience from other countries), and also lists important
development areas where the Bank has gained experience working in other countries, but has had
no hands-on experience in Panama.

Consultations

33. Panama engages democratic processes in the development o f public policy. In addition to
democratic elections - which indicate public preferences for the policy platforms o f parties and
candidates - the Government makes use o f various means o f consultation to develop reforms and
reach agreement. Recent examples include the multi-party negotiations undertaken to conclude a
pension reform, the national referendum on the Panama Canal and the on-going “Concertacion
National Para el Desarolloyy.20The proposed CPS program was developed in close dialogue
with Panamanian authorities over a period o f about six months, including visits, exchanges o f
letters and reviews o f draft documents. The program i s comprised o f the activities requested by
the Government, taking account o f Bank administration resources and the importance o f
maintaining the program’s strategic coherence and integration (which enhances i t s value to
Panama).
20Thisforum for National Dialogue for Development (facilitated by the UNDP) between the Government and a
wide range o f social organizations, including representatives o f indigenous peoples, i s aimed at agreeing on a longterm strategy for economic development and poverty eradication. Central to this strategy i s prioritizing the use o f
additional revenue generated by expansion o f the Panama Canal following its expected completion in 2014. See
Annex 5 for details.

18

34. Formal consultations o f the proposed CPS program were held in Panama on June 28-29.
These included consultations with various stakeholders and meetings with Government
authorities (see Annex 5). O f note, the authorities explained that the current administration plans
to conclude all major policy undertakings by end-December 2008 (to permit a period o f
stocktaking and preparation for the transition to the new administration which would take office
July 1, 2009 following M a y 2009 elections.) As such, they asked that the D P L series conclude
with end-2008 outcomes for which they would be accountable. While the CPS could also
include an option for a follow-on D P L with the incoming administration, they noted that any
policy actions which might be undertaken by the incoming administration could not be predetermined by the current administration.

19

IV. Panama -World Bank Partnership Strategy (FYOS-10)

35. The Country Partnership Strategy aims to provide selective, demand driven assistance that
deepens the Panama-Bank partnership and helps the Government achieve i t s poverty and
inequality reduction goals. The CPS supports four objectives which aim mainly to support the
two less developed facets o f Panama’s three-faceted economy and are aligned with the pillars
and goals o f Panama’s 2004-2009 Strategic Vision (Table 6). As requested by the Government,
the Bank will provide technical, financial, analytical and capacity building assistance to specific
Government policies and programs which contribute to the partnership objectives. The program
i s designed to consolidate and strengthen the notable strategic integration that worked so well
under the I S N by focusing on a limited number o f interrelated objectives and by making
institutional capacity building a cross-cutting theme. In addition, the program anticipates that
there will be a change in Government o n July 1, 2009, and i s set up to help provide the new
Government with information on policy issues as well as access to immediate financial and
technical support to bridge until a new Partnership Strategy i s agreed.

Results Orientation and Monitoring
36. The results orientation o f this CPS i s present in two dimensions. One dimension i s
continued support in the development o f Panama’s national statistical systems, including help to
strengthen national monitoring systems and support better coordination in collection and use of
data by line-ministries. Strong national statistics systems are an essential building block o f
development accountability. Here the Bank will continue to support the Controller General and
the Ministry o f Economy and Finance under the Public Policy TA loan to improve the quality o f
macro-economic indicators and the content o f budgetary and fiscal data in l i n e with international
best practice and to conduct and institutionalize the household living standards measurement
survey. The Bank, which has been executing multi-donor funds to support national statistics
development in the past, will also continue to help build a comprehensive national statistical
system with support from the UK Department for International Development (DFID) (Box 8).
Direct support will also be provided to the Ministries o f Education, Health, Social Development
and Agriculture to strengthen their abilities to collect and use data in coordination with Panama’s
National Department o f Statistics and Census through institutional strengthening components in
the Bank-financed loans. Progress in this dimension will be monitored in the context o f the
individual operations,
Box 8. Panama’s National Strategy for Development Statistics Advances with Bank Support
Over 2005-2006, Panama’s National Department o f Statistics and Census, which operates under the Controller
General (The Direccidn de Estadistica y Censo or DEC) has worked to prepare a National Strategy for
The national strategy i s
Development Statistics with support from the World Bank’s M E C O V I Program.’l
proving a useful tool to promote greater use o f evidence-based policies through better measurement o f living
conditions and stronger linkages among the national M&E systems, but much work remains to fully implement
the strategy.
One o f the main challenges to modernizing Panama’s national statistical system i s to update the legal framework.
The existing Law, which i s 47 years old, i s outdated and insufficient to regulate the new and complex challenges
o f statistical development. A new law has been prepared that would help underpin the new National Strategy and
would provide for clearer coordination within the institutions that comprise the national system. DEC expects
that the new Law w i l l be approved by the end o f 2007.

37. The second related “results” dimension i s the identification and tracking o f specific
milestones and outcomes that the World Bank program i s designed to support over the next 2-3
years. This dimension i s intended to help assess the impact o f Bank-financed operations. A
summary o f CPS activities associated with the four CPS objectives and the approach that will be
used to monitor the results those activities will support follows. Annex 2 describes the CPS
activities in greater detail and Annex 4 elaborates the outcomes and milestones the activities are
expected to support.

Reduce poverty, especially among rural poor and indigenous groups. Expected impacts
associated with this objective and monitoring approaches are set out in on-going and recently

approved Bank-financed projects. Under this objective, the CPS program i s focused on
results in two broad areas: improving the targeting and effectiveness o f social assistance,
including support to the Red de Oportunidades and supporting sustainable increases in rural
productivity. The first area i s supported by the recently approved Social Protection project
and Public Policy Reform TA loan. A Poverty Assessment will complement work planned
under the TA loan and i t s impact would be captured through the TA loan indicators. The
area o f sustainable rural productivity i s supported by the on-going Land Administration
project and the recently approved Rural Productivity Project and i t s GEF counterpart, which
funds sustainable use o f the Atlantic Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. A Rural
Microfinance project will be designed to support sustainability o f outcomes in the land and
rural productivity programs. Follow-on social protection and land projects will be prepared
to build from impacts that are achieved in this CPS period.

Promote broad-based economic growth. The Bank program will be active in three broad
areas that contribute to this objective: helping to make the national-level business
environment more competitive (focusing regulation - including more transparent and
streamlined regulation processes, worker training and innovation support), urban transport
planning in Panama City including mass transit infrastructure, and sustainable tourism
outside Panama City which would focus on policy, the business environment and
infrastructure needs in particular local areas. The first area will be supported by the D P L
series and the on-going Public Policy TA loan, which are underpinned by the 2008 CEM.
The programmatic D P L series will be used to further develop and track progress towards,
and attainment o f specific milestones and outcomes. Urban transport i s expected to be
influenced by the recently completed TA and monitoring o f i t s impacts would be done in the
context o f the planned loan. The planned Sustainable Tourism project would develop the
framework for assessing impact, and i s expected to be in part guided by the planned Country
Environmental Analysis and i s also likely to have l i n k s to the Rural Microfinance project.
Establish modern public financial management (PFM) systems and institutions. The
various interrelated areas covered by this objective and the expected outcomes that the Bank
program i s designed to support will be tracked through the programmatic D P L series.
Improved P F M systems are an important foundation for reaching the poor through more
efficient delivery o f social assistance, for broadening economic opportunity through more
efficient provision o f services needed for businesses to compete, and for reducing
opportunities for corruption to occur. Technical assistance will come through the Public
Policy TA loan and the Debt Management Technical Assistance program (provided by the
Bank’s Treasury Department), drawing from the CFAPAR. Both TA activities include
impact indicators and monitoring frameworks.
e

Improve the health, nutrition, and education attainment of the poor. The CPS program
will contribute to this objective in four ways: expanding access to basic health and nutrition
services for poor families (through the recently approved Social Protection project and
through the planned Health project), increasing the supply o f sustainable clean water and
sanitation in low-income communities (through the recently approved Water Supply and
Sanitation to Low-Income Communities project), and various interventions to improve
education and access from pre-school through secondary school (through the on-going

22

Second Basic Education and the planned new education project). Panama i s also a
beneficiary o f the Central America regional AIDS project which focuses on enhancing
regional diagnostic and surveillance capacity. Human development interventions are being
designed to help the country improve performance on lagging MDGs as they relate to
Government targets. In all cases, specific milestones, results indicators and monitoring
frameworks are built into the lending operations.

Capacity Buildingfor More Effective Public Spending

38. Aligned with the World Bank’s middle income strategy and the expectations o f the
Government (Box 9), the CPS emphasizes building local capacity in line-ministries and agencies
as a cross cutting theme. This ranges from fortifying counterpart ministries’ capacities’ to plan
strategically and monitor for results, to executing projects more efficiently while ensuring their
sustainability. The approach to capacity building draws from the full range o f CPS instruments.
On the one hand, the Bank will continue to assist the Government through analytical reports and
capacity assessments to understand the strengths and weaknesses o f systems and institutions it
seeks to modernize generally and support the Government in implementation o f i t s reform plans
with lending and non-lending technical assistance and policy advice (including on the P F M front
with assistance to MEF, the DGCP and CGR; on the M&E front with support to DEC; and on the
environment front through the planned Country Environment Analysis). At the same time, the
Bank will continue to assess the specific capacities and possible needs o f agencies and ministries
that are counterparts in Bank-financed operations, building in project components and designing
project implementation approaches that make use o f their strengths and help shore-up
weaknesses. Here, the Bank will also give special attention to capacity building as part o f
supervision. Over time, this two-tiered approach aimed at strengthening country systems and
building capacity within Ministries to implement them effectively i s allowing for increased
reliance on those very systems, creating a virtuous cycle. Using local systems to implement
foreign financed projects has the potential o f making them stronger as a consequence. For
example, recently approved Bank-financed lending operations will use Panama’s national
accounting instrument, SIAFPA, for project accounting, which, in turn, with Bank support, i s
leading to more efficient use o f this tool in the Ministries.
Box 9. GOP Favors Building Local Capacity Over Use of FinancialAgents
The strategic focus o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance and the Controller General on building efficient and
modern public finance systems and institutions gave rise to a Government re-think on the use o f financial agents
to support foreign-financed project implementation. Both entities concluded that use o f agents was not only
costly, but was also perpetuating weak Government capacity. Drawing from global experience, the Bank has
provided technical assistance to MEF and the CGR to support the development o f a strategy to systematically
increase the use o f country procedures and systems in foreign financed projects concurrent with measures to
strengthen them. As local capacity continues to improve and local systems approach international norms, the use
o f parallel systems would, in step, be gradually phased out. Before the end o f 2007, MEF and the CGR are
expected to require prior approval and justification for use o f financial agents in future foreign funded operations,
reversing what had become standard operating procedure.

World Bank Lending

39. Given Panama’s status as a high-performing middle-income country, l o w exposure to
IBRD and strong portfolio performance, the Bank will make available $390-$465 million over

23

FY08-10. These resources are expected to rebuild Panama’s portfolio o f World Bank financed
projects to help the Government achieve measurable outcomes in areas it has designated. As
requested by the Government, new financing would be split between Development Policy
Lending (DPL, up to $75 million per year), 7 new poverty-focused investment projects and one
new policy reform technical assistance loan.22 The preparation schedules o f the new investment
and TA loans are either aligned to closing

In accordance with World Bank policy, should Panama’s macro-economic outlook unexpectedly
deteriorate, development policy lending and, consequently, the overall lending envelope would
be recalibrated as appropriate.
41. The proposed D P L series would continue support for the medium-term objectives included
in the Public Finance and Institutional Development Policy Loan (FY07), which was done as a
stand-alone operation in the context o f the ISN, and add an additional set o f objectives related to
measures that are designed to improve Panama’s competitiveness. Building from the FY07
Public Finance and Institutional DPL, the series would continue support for progress in
consolidating and sustaining fiscal discipline and increasing the transparency and efficiency o f
public resource use. The continued advances and remaining challenges in public financial
management modernization are described in B o x 10. In the area o f competitiveness, the D P L
will support the GOP’s strategy to maximize the gains from trade through a complementary
Low World Bank lending exposure in Panama i s a result of periods o f low lending activity, including the recent
2000-2004 hiatus. Lending envelopes and their composition for future CPSs would take account of portfolio size
and exposure as they grow, among other factors.
23 As circumstances unfold, the Bank together with the Government may agree to modify the lending pipeline to
ensure that Bank support i s adding value to the Government’s program. Should critical reforms in one sector stall,
the Bank and Government could agree to shift Bank resources to another area showing more immediate promise. In
the highly unlikely event of severe adverse developments on the macroeconomic or policy front, lending would be
reduced. Any adjustments would be noted in the Progress Report.

agenda that aims to broaden the base o f economic activity by reducing bureaucratic red tape,
lowering barriers to domestic competition, training workers and increasing private sector
productivity through programs to support innovation and technology adoption.

As requested by the Government, the series would support outcomes that could be attained
by December 3 1, 2008 through two DPLs: Competitiveness and Public Financial Management
DPLs I & II (FY08 and FY09). These would reflect political advances and achievements
through the final full fiscal year o f the current administration. An optional FY 10 D P L would be
made available to the new administration. Should the new administration choose to access the
optional FYlO DPL, it would be based on prior actions that would be designed to extend some
key outcomes in areas supported by this CPS. The new administration would, o f course, also
have the option o f developing a new D P L series with the Bank in the context o f a new CPS, or o f
pursuing other forms o f support as it would see i t s requirements.
42.

Box 10. Public Financial Management
The performance o f public financial management (PFM) systems including public procurement i s a critical
factor for fiscal discipline, strategic allocation, operational efficiency and transparency in use o f public finds.
The Bank’s 2007 Country Financial Accountability and Procurement Assessment Report (CFAPAR) concludes
that the PFM system in Panama possesses a number o f strengths that contribute to fiscal discipline control, such
as legal powers to contain budgeted expenditures, timely monitoring o f budget execution data and cash flows,
centralization o f revenues, and adequate debt management. However, as implied by the Government strategy’s
pillar 111, Reform o f Public Finance, certain key institutional issues require and are also now getting attention.
The cited qualities provide a good base to continue advancing in the areas where there i s room for improvement.
With respect to the fiscally sustainable strategic allocation o f resources, the initiatives underway to develop a
medium-term budget framework should continue, with particular emphasis on the operational and transparent
reconciliation o f the “top-down” fiscal framework and the “bottom-up” budgeting process (Le., costed strategic
plans with aligned investment programs), and on better control o f in-year budget modifications to enhance the
credibility o f the original budget as the main tool for policy implementation.
In terms o f operational efficiency, government procurement could be optimized under the framework o f a
comprehensive public procurement strategy comprising, among others, cost reduction strategies (price
benchmarking, consolidation for economies o f scale) and more efficient procedures (including basic tools such
as standard documents, manuals and guidelines). The Government i s actively moving in that direction with the
aid o f a recently approved modern legal procurement framework. On the other hand, transactional controls (both
ex-ante fiscal control and the entities’ own procedures) could be streamlined and applied on the basis o f risk
management considerations, and complemented by strengthening external audit capacity. The Office o f the
Controller’s General (CGR) i s paying increasing attention to modernization o f ex-ante and ex-post controls as
central pieces to i t s multi-annual strategic plan. The Ministry o f Finance, in turn, i s strengthening treasury and
information systems to reduce payment arrears.

Concrete actions have been taken recently to enhance transparency o f public finances, such as the increase in
information that i s made publicly available and the legal protection given to rights o f access to that information.
These are good foundations to continue improving public financial information, with a view to reaching
convergence with international practice, in areas such as tax and payment arrears, quality o f financial statements,
and coverage o f financial audits. Progress has also been made with the operation o f the electronic procurement
system (Panamacompra), which, under the adoption o f a strategic plan to complete its development and
implementation, will help ensure a smooth transition to an electronic public procurement marketplace.

43. Along with a technical assistance package on debt management and debt market
development, the Treasury Department will advise the Government on how to take advantage o f
the full array o f IBRD financing and risk management products. For example, IBRD banking

25

products could provide flexibility to Panama in managing i t s debt, including the ability to change
the financial characteristics o f existing and future loans to better manage the financial risks
relating to interest rates, rollover and commodity price volatility. Panama has an increasing
portfolio o f fixed-spread loans (FSLs) with the Bank, but has yet to take full advantage o f the
embedded risk management tools included in the FSLs that address interest rate risks and
commodity price volatility. Furthermore, as Panama’s loan portfolio with the Bank includes
fixed-rate single currency loans and variable-spread loans, the Government may want to consider
signing an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Agreement with IBRD, thus
gaining access to a range o f banking products to manage the interest rate and currency risks o f
these types o f loans. An ISDA Agreement may also provide Panama access to hedging products
for debt contracted with other financial institutions.

Analytical and Advisory Services

44. Given the breadth o f analytical work done over the last two years, this stage o f the
partnership aims to build more in-depth sectoral analysis into programs that are supported by
loan financing, as part o f the emphasis on local capacity building. Such studies will address
various education and health topics. In addition, the preparation o f two new cross-cutting
analytical reports will be led by World Bank staff in FY09, a Poverty Assessment and an Urban
Development Study. The urban study will focus on poverty and related infrastructure, service
delivery and potential social issues o f urban development. As has been the tradition with past
Poverty Assessments, these studies will be done to support capacity within Government
counterparts, including direct technical assistance related to immediate policy priorities. A
Country Environmental Analysis will review the state o f existing country environmental
safeguards and help support the preparation o f a sustainable tourism project. Panama will also
be included in at least one regional study that i s planned for FYOS-FY10: a study o f r u r a l
microfinance.

45. The analytical and advisory program also includes preparation o f policy notes that will
cover areas o f World Bank engagement as a tool for informing policy discussions leading up to
and following the 2009 national elections. The goal i s to provide objective technical views on
progress, challenges and policy options. The World Bank will seek to coordinate policy
messages with other key donors, including the IDB, IMF and UNDP. Finally, with the opening
o f a Country Office, the Bank will work to foster closer ties to civil society and other nongovernment institutions to enrich the quality and potential impact o f analytical reports and
advice.
IFC Activities
46. IFC will continue to focus i t s operations in the financial and infrastructure sectors to help
improve access to finance for underserved segments o f the population, and on projects that
promote growth in line with the second CPS objective (promoting broad-based economic
growth). IFC will also look for opportunities in the extractive industry sector where IFC would
bring value-added in terms o f improved environmental and social practices, better revenue
generation, and good benefits for local and surrounding communities also in line with promoting
broad-based economic growth. Finally, IFC will maintain i t s overall interest in supporting

26

institutions that have a regional focus rather than a country level focus, so that small economies
in the area would benefit from economies o f scale in various aspects, including physical and
financial infrastructure.

Donor Harmonization and Coordination
47. The Directorate o f Technical Cooperation at the Ministry o f Economy and Finance i s
responsible for donor coordination. This Directorate also serves as the liaison for nonreimbursable technical assistance used in the preparation o f Bank-financed investment projects.
Staff from the Directorate o f Technical Cooperation regularly engages in work program planning
with Panama's various development partners on an individual basis, ensuring that the
Government's strategic needs are being met. Donors then coordinate amongst themselves in
complementary or overlapping program areas.
48. As the size o f the World Bank program in Panama grows, coordination and harmonization
will become an increasing focus, especially with the IDB to ensure synergies among the lending
programs. This will be aided by the opening o f a World Bank Country office in Panama City.
As part o f the consultations for preparation o f this CPS, the Bank and IDB have gone through the
CPS program to identify areas o f potential synergy and agreed on collaboration approaches in
both lending and non-lending activities. These range from consultation between IDB and World
Bank teams to support program synergies, to joint project preparation or supervision o f projects
in a common sector. (See Table 3 in Annex 3).

Risks
49. The staged approach o f stepped up partnership with Panama, building from an Interim
Strategy (FY06-07) to a full Country Partnership Strategy, has facilitated the tailoring o f
program commitments to evolving developments while reducing risk. Panama i s in a stronger
macroeconomic position than it was when the I S N was agreed, and the political situation has also
proved conducive to advancing on policy reforms in line with the administration's Strategic
Vision. In addition, the majority o f activities proposed in this CPS have a strong foundation in
on-going work, including strong portfolio performance.

50. Though macroeconomic vulnerabilities have diminished as growth has accelerated, debt
has fallen as a share o f GDP, and fiscal balances have improved, the medium-term outlook i s not
completely without risks. The strategy takes into account potential risks in three areas:
economic, political and portfolio performance.

5 1. Economic: Panama i s currently experiencing a major economic boom, in part fueled by
external resource inflows, especially in the real estate market. This raises the possibility o f
overheating the economy and o f introducing various distortions in the form o f real exchange rate
over-valuation and raising real wages above levels supported by productivity growth. But, by
keeping the economy open and extending the openness through free trade agreements, including
with the United States, the pressures on the economy are expected to be relieved. The Bank i s
supporting the Government in analysis o f economic challenges and possible actions in the
Country Economic Memorandum, a draft o f which will be discussed with Government in late

27

2007 for completion in 2008. At the sector level, there i s the risk o f rapid urbanization that i s
outpacing the Government’s urban planning and regulatory capacities, as well as i t s ability to
provide adequate public infrastructure. As requested by the Government, the Bank will prepare a
study o f Urban Development to contribute to the discussion o f possible actions and priorities. In
addition, just as the country’s openness and economic structure have allowed Panama to benefit
from the recent global upturn, the country i s vulnerable to an economic global slowdown which
could have a negative impact on canal trade, exports and related economic activities.
52. The expansion o f the Canal i s a large undertaking and thus raises the possibility that
completion o f the project will exceed the budget, or that Panama Canal Authority revenues will
fall short. This could potentially increase borrowing needs and increase demand for materials
and labor in what i s already expected to be a tight market. However, the authorities are
confident that the thorough preparations mitigate strongly against this possibility and ensure that
construction costs will not surpass projections. The budget estimates include contingencies o f 20
percent to deal with unforeseen events and price escalations. In addition, effective July 1, 2007,
the Canal Authority raised tolls. This will generate an estimated $1.3 billion in additional
revenue between 2007-2014 (beyond original financing plans) with scope for future increases as
needs arise. The Bank will support the Government in monitoring fiscal sustainability and
potential vulnerabilities through the C E M and the D P L series.
53. Another potential source o f vulnerability i s Panama’s relatively high level o f external debt.
This potentially renders the country vulnerable to increases in international interest rates or
otherwise tighter capital market conditions. This risk, however, i s offset to a considerable extent
by three factors:
0

0

0

The Government’s sound fiscal management which has led to substantial primary surpluses
causing debt to decline. The Bank will continue to support the Government in these areas
through the D P L series.
Panama has considerable reserves and assets which offset i t s debt liabilities. For example,
Panama’s Trust Fund for Development (Fondo Fiduciario), which was established in 1995
with funds collected from privatization o f public enterprises and the sale o f some reverted
areas had assets equivalent to 8.5% o f GDP in 2004. The Canal i t s e l f i s another significant
Government asset. These contribute to a substantially lower net debt.
The Government has been improving debt management and will continue these efforts with
technical assistance from the Bank’s Treasury.

As noted under the lending discussion (para. 39-43), in the highly unlikely event o f severe
adverse developments on the macroeconomic or policy front, development policy lending would
be recalibrated and overall lending would be reduced.
54. Political: President Torrijos enjoys wide popularity and i s supported by a majority in the
Legislative Assembly. H i s Government will complete i t s term o f office on June 30, 2009.
Under Panama’s Constitution, the president may not be elected to a consecutive term.
Traditionally, new administrations have upon taking office made substantial changes within the
civil service, especially in line ministries. These staffing changes can make an orderly transition
challenging and can be disruptive to on-going programs, including those where the Bank i s

28

providing support. The Bank is, o f course a small actor in this process. As recommended by
QAG, the Bank will support the transition by preparing a set o f policy notes to provide
presidential candidates with an additional source o f information about development challenges
and on-going policies and programs. In addition, the Bank will coordinate with the new
administration on training needs, especially with respect to project implementation.

55.

Portfolio Performance: The composition o f the portfolio i s changing in two important
ways which are likely to affect disbursement rates in the short-term. First, many new projects
are being added to the portfolio, including new projects with ministries that have l i t t l e experience
in project execution. Projects tend to disburse at lower rates over the first 1-2 years. Secondly,
executing agencies are forgoing the use and support o f parallel systems and agencies, which i s
also likely to temporarily slow the pace o f project implementation and disbursements. The Bank
and Government are prepared for these changes and are working to mitigate against the risks
through intensive capacity building efforts and more active Bank presence in Panama through
the opening o f a Country Office. Moreover, the risks o f a short-term slowdown in the rate o f
project implementation are considered acceptable in light o f the substantial up-side potential o f
building more efficient public financial management institutions and capacity in the line
ministries that are tasked with bringing improved social assistance and services to the poor.

Select Sector Development Challenges and W o r l d Bank Support

Under the framework o f the Interim Strategy Note (FY06-07) the Bank provided
analytical, technical and financial support to select government initiatives which formed
part o f the Torrijos administration’s 2004-2009 National Strategic Vision. The Country
Partnership Strategy builds from work in those areas and also includes support in selected
new areas where the Bank offers a comparative advantage.
This annex provides additional background information on development challenges
facing sectors in which the Bank program i s active, including what was done under the
ISN and what i s planned under the CPS. Table 1 (on the following page) maps out the
pillars o f the Government’s Strategic Vision, specific sectoral challenges where the Bank
i s supporting the Government response, relevant Government programs, and related Bank
ISN and CPS activities. The following text elaborates each o f these topics by pillar.
Pillar I:Reduce Poverty and Income Inequality

A. W e a k Targeting o f Social Assistance and Ineffective Programs
As assessed in the draft Panama Poverty Assessment: Toward Effective Poverty
Reduction (forthcoming in 2007), Panama’s expenditure o f 1.7% o f GDP on social
assistance surpasses the Latin America average by 70%, but the results, in terms o f
supporting greater economic equality, have not been commensurate with the level o f
spending. Two-thirds o f Panama’s social assistance spending in 2005 went to universal
subsidies for electricity, utility provided water, cooking gas and gasoline - luxuries that
are usually beyond the reach o f poor families. At the same time, poor people, especially
those living in indigenous areas have lacked access to basic social services due to both
demand and supply side constraints. The historic lack o f coherence in social assistance
programs has contributed to weak poverty impact. This impact would be substantially
strengthened by consolidating programs, improving the targeting o f social assistance to
benefit major at-risk groups, particularly the extreme poor and those living in indigenous
areas, and systematically monitoring and evaluating to make sure money i s getting
desired results.
Efforts to build Panama’s capacity in monitoring and analyzing poverty data and trends,
and applying data to social assistance have begun to facilitate better targeting o f
resources, but challenges remain. The National Census and Statistics Directorate (DEC)
faces capacity constraints to institutionalizing regular Living Standard Measurement
Surveys (LSMS) as part o f i t s role as the focal point coordinating national statistics. An
additional challenge i s to ensure the transfer o f knowledge in data production and poverty
analytics from the MEF to staff in DEC and the new Social Policy Division in the
Ministry o f Social Development (MIDES), created in 2005 to oversee social policy
strategy.

Government Response:
Strengthen Poverty Monitoring. The Ministry o f Finance conducted a second
national LSMS in 2003. The Torrijos administration used the data to update

poverty maps, which have helped target new social assistance. The Government i s planning
a third LSMS in 2008 and intends to use the results to help evaluate social assistance and to
again update poverty maps. Bank Contribution under the ISN. The Bank’s Policy Reform
TA loan supported the implementation and analysis o f the 2003 L S M S , and updating o f
poverty maps. The Bank’s 2007 Poverty Assessment analyzed and documented countrywide
poverty trends and disparities and provided recommendations on poverty reduction.
Launch of the Red de Oportunidades (RDO). In early 2006, the Government launched a new
effort - the Red de Oportunidades - including a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program that
aims to raise the living standards o f extremely poor rural non-indigenous and indigenous
groups by removing supply and demand side barriers to basic social services, conditioning
cash on families sending their kids to school and getting them regular health check-ups,
including vaccinations, and providing economic opportunities through provision o f basic
infrastructure and other programs. Bank Contribution under the ISN. Preparation o f the
2007 Poverty Assessment included technical assistance to design the targeting mechanism
and pilot initiative o f the CCT program, in addition to assessing the targeting efficiency o f
current social assistance initiatives.

The CPS (FY08-10) will continue support for these areas:
9 Strengthen poverty monitoring. Bank funded technical assistance and analytical work will
continue efforts to strengthen government capacity in collecting, analyzing and applying
poverty data to enhance the effectiveness o f social spending. Additional financing for the
ongoing Public Policy Reform TA will finance the 2008 LSMS and support updating o f
poverty maps. The FY09 Poverty Assessment will analyze the evolution o f poverty during a
period o f remarkable growth, and will assess whether Government’s new social protection
programs have been effective in reducing extreme poverty by targeting the neediest. In
addition, an FY09 Urban Development study will look into questions o f urban migration and
planning to mitigate against potentially large increases in urban poverty.
9 Support the Red de Oportunidades, including social sector administration. The recently
approved Social Protection project supports improved management and operation o f the
RDO’s conditional cash transfer program to enhance i t s effectiveness in reaching the poorest
and indigenous groups. The project will support initiatives to increase beneficiary
participation in the program, strengthen the supply o f nutrition and child growth promotion
interventions in indigenous areas (comarcas), and enhance government capacity to develop
coherent and efficient social sector policies and interventions on the basis o f evidence. The
planned FY09 Poverty Assessment will help to analyze the effectiveness o f interventions. A
follow-on project will be prepared in FYlO to further strengthen the program with the new
Government and broaden social assistance reform.
B. High Rural Poverty Due to Insufficient Economic Opportunity
Despite being at the forefront o f Central America in per capita income, Panama’s rural poverty
remains high; 54% o f rural non-indigenous residents were poor and 22% extremely poor in 2003.
Among the indigenous, a staggering 98.4% were poor, and 90% extremely poor. Progress on
rural poverty reduction i s impeded by limited economic opportunity partly generated by the
poor’s lack o f access to land, land titles and microfinance, and structural constraints on
competitiveness in the agricultural sector.

Annex 2
Page 4 o f 14

Panama’s rural sector has one o f the most skewed distributions o f land in the Central America,
and efforts to equalize land access for the rural poor have been impeded by land administration
hurdles. In 2001, the poor, who accounted for two-thirds o f the rural population, owned only one
third o f the land. Only one-third o f agricultural land was titled, and o f those 85% o f titles
belonged to the non-poor. Today, 20,000 to 30,000 families s t i l l lack access to land, which has
increased pressure to occupy land in forests and protected areas, threatening biodiversity and
long-term environmental sustainability. Panama has in recent years made headway in improving
land administration, rural land regularization, and protected area management. However, these
efforts need strengthening, as land administration services, including titling, registration and
cadastre services, are s t i l l under-funded and fragmented, and biodiversity remains threatened.
Structural inefficiencies and sector management challenges in the agricultural sector have
contributed to weak growth in agriculture, limiting poverty reduction. Sector expenditures under
the Ministry o f Agriculture (MIDA) are not efficiently aligned with Panama’s comparative
advantages, which has dragged down agricultural performance. The rural sector i s dominated by
isolated small-scale farmers inadequately linked to extension services, rural finances and
markets, preventing farmers from modernizing their practices and selling more products under a
more open trade environment. MIDA’s management structures and operations also need
modernization, including monitoring and evaluation o f sector interventions to enhance sector
learning.

Government Response:
Enhance landsecurity and access for the rural poor. In line with Panama’s 2004-2009
Strategic Vision and i t s Programa Nacional de Administracidn de Tierras (PRONAT),
President Torrijos’s administration i s carrying out land administration reforms and promoting
land access for the poor. In 2006, two key pieces o f legislation were approved which
considerably simplified land regularization procedures, including the new law permitting
mass land titling. Bank Contribution under the I S N . The Bank’s Land Administration
Project was restructured to align with new Administration’s priorities and i s supporting
modernization o f land administration, including mass titling in rural areas, streamlined titling
procedures, and greater regularization o f protected and indigenous land.
Reorient MIDA to export-oriented support to farmers, including support to increase rural
productivity.
Government developed a 2004-2009 Agricultural Strategy focused on
increasing agricultural productivity, yields, and farmer incomes in rural areas to capitalize on
free trade and reduce rural poverty and unemployment. Panama has also begun to reform
sector management and policies under MIDA. Bank Contribution under the I S N . The
Rural Productivity Project (FY07) supports reorientation o f MIDA and introduces support for
producer alliances (see below).
Promote sustainable use of the Atlantic Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Under i t s 20042009 Strategy o f Conservation for Sustainable Development, Panama’s National
Environment Authority (ANAM) aims to strengthen stakeholder partnerships and
institutional capacity to better manage protected areas and biodiversity. Bank Contribution
over the I S N . Building from gains under the Panama Mesoamerican Biological Corridor
GEF project, a new project was prepared to invest in small-scale rural groups to promote
natural resource management and sustainable productive opportunities in fourteen protected

Annex 2
Page 5 o f 14
areas and buffer zones. The project was also designed to continue supporting improved
management o f the National Protected Areas System (SNAP), strengthened co-management
arrangements and enhanced monitoring and evaluation capacity in ANAM.

The CPS (FY08-10) will continue to support these areas:
9 Enhance land security and access for the rural poor. The ongoing Land Administration
Project will continue to support development o f regulations to simplify the regularization
process, complete demarcation o f indigenous communities and provide support to survey,
title and register thousands o f additional rural and urban properties, and regularize coastal
areas. A Land Access Project will be prepared in FY09 to complete rural land regularization
and initiate a program to provide land and complementary productive assets and technical
assistance to the poor.
9 Support increased rural productivity among small-scale producers, including access to
rural microfinance. The Rural Productivity Project will finance business plans for alliances
between Rural Producer Associations (RPAs) and commercial partners to boost market
access and competitiveness in Herrera, Los Santos and Veraguas, and provide training and
capacity building to establish new and strengthen existing RPAs. Together with the proposed
Land Access and Rural Microfinance projects, small-scale producers will have access to
greater assets (land and capital) and tools (including skills and ability to work in producer
associations) to increase their incomes and compete in more sustainable ways for trade
opportunities.
> Promote sustainable use o f the Atlantic Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. The
ongoing GEF project will continue support for sustainable conservation and productive
activities in or near protected areas as noted above.
Pillar 11:Promote Economic Growth and Development
A. Restricted Market Access and Insufficient Competitiveness
In the early 1990s Panama had one o f the most distorted trade regimes in the region. As late as
1996, tariffs ranged from zero to 90%, basic grains had even higher tariffs and quotas and other
non-tariff barriers (NTBs) were used extensively, resulting in high food prices and extremely l o w
agricultural productivity and incomes. Over the next few years, the Government lowered tariffs
and eliminated all NTBs. Tariffs were reduced to a maximum o f 15% (with the exception o f
cars, milk, rice and sugar). Certain tariffs were subsequently increased by the incoming
administration (1999-2004). As o f January 2007, Panama's median tariff remained l o w at 3%,
with an average o f 6.6%, but with a relatively high dispersion across products. Two percent o f
tariff lines face tariffs greater than 15% (virtually all o f them affect food products, including
chicken parts (260% tariff), milk products (up to 155% tariff) and sugar (144%)). The
Government has continued the disuse o f core NTBs (e.g., quotas, import licenses, anti-dumping
and countervailing duties). Furthermore, in late 2006 the GOP implemented an important
institutional reform that improved the transparency o f the publication and enforcement o f
phytosanitary standards for the importation and commercialization o f agricultural and food
products.
In 1996, the government passed a competition law which removed remaining price controls and
established an anti-trust and consumer protection framework, including creation o f the

Annex 2
Page 6 o f 14

Competition and Consumer Affairs Commission (CLICAC).' This framework has begun to take
hold, but important areas o f deregulation would contribute to eliminating remaining distortions.
For example, competition in o i l refining and marketing has continued to be restricted, including
through differential taxes, administered prices and other measures. In addition, the breach
between the high minimum wages and skill level o f many in the labor force i s an obstacle to
achieving growth potential under more open markets. Education and training disparities will
need attention to help close this gap. Competition would also benefit from applying best
practices to support innovation. Public R&D spending as a percent o f GDP trails 30% behind
L A C averages. Finally, streamlined and improved regulations and procedures for SME start-up
and operations would remove impediments to business generation, exerting a positive impact on
growth.

Government Response:
Support free trade. To boost exports and promote growth particularly in rural areas, GOP
concluded negotiations o f a free trade agreement with the United States, initiated discussions
with the European Community and i s working to dismantle protectionist policies and trade
barriers. Bank Contribution over the ISN. The Public Policy Reform TA (PPR TA)
helped build government capacity to negotiate and satisfy standards for multilateral trade
agreements.
Improve domestic competitiveness. GOP i s aiming to make the local business environment
more competitive by reducing the time and cost to complete business-related processes,
including business registration and import and export procedures, and reform commercial
regulations governing consumer protection and entry o f businesses into specific domestic
markets, GOP i s supporting greater investments in R&D and technical and skills-based
training for workers in growth sectors. Under the 2006-2010 National Strategic Plan for
Development o f Science, Technology and Development, GOP i s providing matching grants
to finance R&D, private sector innovation projects, and scholarships to produce more
Panamanian researchers. GOP i s also expected, under a consolidated and revamped National
Training Institute, to provide technical training to Panamanian workers in strategic areas such
as Canal expansion. Bank Contribution over the ISN. The PPR TA provided support to
strengthen institutions and commercial regulations related to competition and consumer
protection. The forthcoming CEMIICA analyzes the potential distributional impacts o f the
free trade agreement with the U S and Canal expansion with a view to identifying
opportunities for broadening the base o f economic opportunity, especially through domestic
competitiveness improvements.

The CPS (FY08- 10) will broaden support for making Panama more competitive:
> Reduce costs o f doing business and increase domestic competition. The D P L series and
the PPR TA will support efforts to eliminate and streamline business procedures, such as
increasing online transactions through the Panama Tramita internet portal, and support
development o f e-commerce. The PPR TA will also support regulatory modernization and
institutional capacity building to support trade standards, a general tourism law, and a more
transparent and non-discriminatory regulatory environment promoting competition,
particularly in the utility sector.

' Comision de Libre Competencia y Asuntos del Consumidor

Annex 2
Page 7 o f 14

Increase formal employment and improve worker training. The D P L series will support
efforts to increase the number o f workers with marketable skills through training and
certification programs. This i s expected to reduce the breach between workers’ skills and the
minimum wage, thereby reducing incentives for informal employment. The planned third
education project will help expand emphasis on marketable skills to secondary and tertiary
programs.
Increase innovation and productivity. The D P L series will support Panama’s National
Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation program to expand matching grant funds
for R&D, establish an R&D trust fund and sector funds in strategic areas, and expand
scholarship program for researchers. Under Government’s Agenda Complementaria, the
DPLs will also support development o f a program to increase economic opportunities under
trade liberalization for Panama’s most vulnerable groups.

B. Growth and Urban Poverty Reduction Impeded by Inadequate Transport Network I n
Panama City
Congestion and strained public transport services in Panama City have increased costs o f doing
business and are an obstacle to urban poverty reduction. 46% o f Panamanians live in Panama
City, but inadequate transport investments and policies have led to daily congestion and traffic
bottlenecks, poor traffic management, and deficient road and public transport services,
particularly on key trunk lines. In 2004, congestion delays in Panama City cost an estimated
$300 million in productivity losses, equivalent to 2.2% o f Panama’s nominal GDP. Congestion
and limited mass transit alternatives have also reduced economic opportunities for the urban poor
who disproportionately rely on inefficient public transportation requiring hours to reach j o b
centers. Urban poverty grew from 15.3% in 1997 to 20.0% in 2003, even as overall poverty
declined.

Government Response:
Modernize Panama City ’s transportation network and public transport services.
Government prioritized under i t s 2004-2009 Strategic Vision improving urban transport as a
key ingredient to promoting economic growth and reducing urban poverty. In Panama City,
Government elaborated a series o f projects to modernize urban transport through road, traffic
and pedestrian improvements, and expanded mass transit services, including a dedicated busline system. Bank Contribution over the ISN. The Bank’s FY07 Urban Transport Study
TA program helped develop a comprehensive urban transport policy and action plan that also
took account o f the transport needs o f the urban poor. An ongoing Public-Private
Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) grant i s helping GOP develop a strategy for
redeploying transport operations as part o f an overall strategy to shift to a dedicated bus-line
system.

The CPS (FY08-10) will build upon efforts begun in the I S N to improve urban transport and
mass transit services in Panama City:
P Modernize Panama City’s transportation network and public transport services. The
Bank will continue technical assistance to build institutional capacity within Panama’s
Transport Authority (ATTT) during preparation and implementation o f a planned investment
project that will partially finance up to three dedicated mass transit bus lines which will
improve mobility o f Panama City’s urban poor.

C. Underdeveloped Tourism Outside o f Panama City
Tourism i s a sector with high potential in Panama, a country that i s not affected by natural
disasters and with unique natural resources, including beautiful coastal areas and islands.
However, tourism i s underdeveloped outside Panama City and offers potential for more socially
inclusive economic development in remote areas. To do this in a sustainable way will require
careful land use planning, infrastructure development with attention to environmental safeguards
and capacity building and training o f local laborers.
Government Response: The Government, through I P A T (Instituto Panamenio de Turismo), has
undertaken a systematic inventory o f areas with tourism potential and with assistance from
UNDP, IDB and O M T (Organizacion Mundial de Tursimo) i s preparing a long t e r m master plan
for sustainable tourism development (Plan Maestro de Desarrollo Turistico Sostenible 20072020) that entails clarifying land tenure, ensuring that development i s culturally sensitive and
consistent with sustainable natural resource use, identifying and addressing infrastructure needs
and building local human resource capacity.

The CPS (FY08-10) envisions collaboration with IDB:
> Develop sustainable tourism outside Panama City. The World Bank will collaborate with
other stakeholders and donors to support government interventions to enhance sustainable
tourism along the lines o f the tourism master plan. The World Bank will provide a package
o f technical and financial support for particular geographic areas that will be agreed with the
Government. The proposed sustainable tourism project will focus on sustainable tourism
planning, eco- and agro-tourism and environmental conservation, institutional strengthening,
building local capacity and promoting the participation o f rural communities and investments
in infrastructures. A Country Environmental Analysis will inform the project.
D. IFC Support to Economic Growth: Strengthening Financial Services and Infrastructure
As stated in the ISN, IFC’s support during that period focused on the financial and infrastructure
sectors in the context o f supporting regionally focused activities in Central America. Five
investment projects were committed during the I S N period, three in the financial sector and two
in infrastructure for an overall amount o f $145 million on IFC’s own account. One advisory
service project in infrastructure was concluded in FY07. All six projects supported Panama’s
Pillar 11 o f promoting economic growth and employment as well as Pillar Iin reducing poverty
and inequality.
In the financial sector, IFC committed a $40 million loan in FY04 aimed at helping Banco
Continental de Panama provide long-term funding to productive enterprises as well as support
the Bank’s strategy o f providing traditional banking products and services throughout Central
America. That same year, a $15 million loan was committed to L a Hipotecaria, a specialized
full-service housing finance company, to support i t s existing operations in Panama and assist in
expanding i t s operations in El Salvador. The third financial sector operation, a $25 million loan,
was committed in FY07 to Banvivienda, a domestic bank to help it expand mortgage banking
availability to provide low- and middle-income people with access to long-term funding for
housing.

Annex 2
Page 9 o f 14
In infrastructure, IFC committed two operations in FY05 for a total o f $65 million. One
operation was to finance the three -year capital expenditure program o f Manzanillo International
Port Terminal located next to the Colon Free Trade Zone. This would allow the port to meet the
projected five-year demand and help it maintain i t s competitive position in Panama. The second
operation was a $15 million standby credit facility to COPA, an international airline
headquartered in Panama. Through this operation, IFC i s supporting the continued expansion o f
a strong regional airline. In FY07 IFC successfully concluded an advisory service mandate
advising the Government o f Panama and the Agency for the Panama Pacific0 Special Economic
Zone on the selection o f a private Master developer for a phased development o f the areas as an
international multi-use service and logistic center.

As o f end-April 2007, IFC’s committed portfolio in Panama stood at $225.1 million (including
$21.4 million in syndications) in nine projects in the financial sector (five projects),
transportation and warehousing (three projects) and utilities (one project).
Pillar 111and V: Reform Public Finance and Modernize the State

A. High Fiscal Deficits and Debt Threatened Long-Term Sustainability
Panama’s fiscal balance began to deteriorate rapidly after 2000, resulting in primary deficits in
2003 and 2004. This decline reflected deterioration in finances o f the central government and
the Social Security Institute (CSS), mostly due to declines in revenues, rather than increased
expenditures. In parallel, the ranks o f civil servants swelled, particularly in the CSS, creating
additional budget pressures. Fiscal administration also became less transparent; for example,
increasing recourse was taken to deficit financing via payment arrears, which obscured the
quality o f fiscal information. Panama’s overall public sector fiscal deficit reached an alarming
4.9 percent o f GDP in 2004, raising Panama’s public debt to 66 percent o f GDP, and triggering
new concerns about the country’s future debt sustainability.
Government Response: To strengthen fiscal discipline, the Torrijos administration adopted
fiscal and pension reforms that put Panama’s debt trajectory back on sustainable path and
medium-term fiscal targets (2009) within reach.2 Bank Contribution over the ISN. The FY07
D P L supported the fiscal and pension reforms.

*

Panama’s short and medium-term growth projections have improved since early 2006, as actual growth in 2006
turned out to be almost double the 4.5% projected at the beginning o f 2006 and considering that economic activity
indicators during the first semester o f 2007 have continued at the same pace as in the first semester o f 2006. Also,
the country’s fiscal outlook continues to be strong: total central government revenues grew by 36% during 2006,
divided equally between tax and non-tax revenues. Although the growth in revenues also reflected a few one-time,
non-recurrent inflows (overdue tax payment by the Panama Ports Company and a capital gains tax o n the sale o f a
large private Panamanian bank), these only accounted for about one-half o f the increase in non-tax revenues. (The
other h a l f i s mainly accounted for by the increased tolls charged by the Panama Canal authority, which are
scheduled to rise further.) In the absence o f these non-recurrent revenues, the overall NFPS balanced would have
yielded a deficit o f 0.6% o f GDP in 2006, instead o f the reported surplus o f 0.5%. Nevertheless, this means that the
Government already has over-performed on i t s medium-term fiscal deficit target o f 1% o f GDP, which was to be
reached gradually by 2009. In light o f these positive developments, the NFPS balance over 2007-09 is projected
(conservatively) to remain close to the original deficit target o f 1% o f GDP.

The CPS (FY08-10) will continue to help Panama achieve fiscal and debt sustainability:
Fiscal sustainability. The World Bank will continue to support the Government’s fiscal
reforms and medium-term fiscal targets through the D P L series.
Debt management and debt market development. The World Bank will support
government efforts to improve debt management and develop debt markets through provision
o f analysis, technical assistance, capacity building and IBRD financial products.

B. Underdeveloped Public Fnancial Management Perpetuates Inefficiencies and Higher
costs
The advances and challenges in public financial management are discussed in B o x 10 in the
main text.
Government Response:
Improve fiscal transparency, including through reduced payment arrears. Government i s
working to improve and standardize financial documentation and improve the quality and
quantity o f available fiscal data, with a view to gradually complying with international
standards. Government i s also aiming to eliminate payment arrears and keep payments
current. Bank Contribution over the ISN. The 2007 Country Financial Accountability and
Procurement Assessment Report (CFAPAR) assesses fiscal transparency practices against
international standards. I t s preparation includes TA and discussions o f priority actions. The
FY07 D P L supported the government program and helped identify targets indicators o f
medium-termprogress.
Develop medium-term, policy-based budgeting. The Government has established a 20062009 medium-term budgetary framework and aims to strengthen public investment planning
and forecasting. The Government has also begun work to develop a medium-term fiscal and
budgetary framework, including preparation o f fiscal projections and draft multi-annual
budgets to achieve more productive investments and better allocate public resources in line
with national objectives and fiscal policy. Bank Contribution over the ISN. The draft 2007
CFAPAR discusses the importance o f improved medium-term budgeting integrating accurate
sector and institutional budgets, and o f improved compliance with public investment
programming procedures. The FY07 D P L supported advances in medium-term budgeting
and helped identify medium-term indicators.
Modernize public procurement. To generate savings, Government has taken steps to
modernize the procurement system, including reforming the Public Procurement Directorate
(DCP), developing a comprehensive procurement strategy, launching an e-procurement
system (PanamaCompra), and adopting a new procurement law (Ley 22) that modernizes
procurement practices. Bank Contribution over the ISN. The 2007 CFAPAR assessed the
reform strategy and provided just-in-time policy advice, including to the draft procurement
law. The Bank’s ongoing Policy Reform TA loan i s funding additional studies, and the
FY07 D P L supported key measures and helped frame medium-term targets.
Improve efJiciency of the Controller General (CG), Government has prioritized reviewing
the CG’s ex-ante transaction controls with a view to streamlining controls based on risk
management considerations and strengthening external audit capacity. Bank Contribution
over the ISN. The 2007 CPAFAR analyzed the CG’s transactional practices and discussed
the importance o f adoption o f a risk management tool that could raise the threshold for exante reviews and other measures to improve efficiency.

Annex 2
Page 11 o f 14

The CPS (FY08-10) will continue support for these areas:
Improve fiscal transparency, including through reduced payment arrears. The D P L
series and technical assistance from the ongoing PPR TA will continue to support more
frequent and comprehensive publication o f public financial data in line with international
standards, and the reduction o f arrears to under 2% in 2010 from 5.8% in 2005. In addition,
Bank-financed investment projects will provide capacity building support to l i n e ministries to
strengthen financial management and payment systems and practices.
Develop medium-term, policy-based budgeting.
D P L lending will support
institutionalization o f rolling medium-term budgets and the development and integration o f
well-substantiated agency and sector projections.
Modernize public procurement. The ongoing PPR TA project will continue to provide
technical support to implement government’s new procurement law (Ley 22), build capacity
within the DCP, continue updating PanamaCompra (new e-procurement system), and
prepare surveys on public perceptions o f the procurement system. The D P L series will
support strengthening o f the new e-procurement system, development and implementation o f
a sector reform strategy, and achievement o f system improvements according to standard
OECD procurement indicators.
Improve efficiency o f the Controller General. The Bank will provide technical assistance
under the PPR TA to the Controller General’s Office, as part o f the CG’s efforts to
modernize i t s fiscal control systems and consider adoption o f a risk based system for ex-ante
reviews o f procurement decisions. The Bank will also support capacity building in lineministries through investment projects to allow them to become more self-sufficient, relying
less on the C G for processing transactions, and thereby allowing the C G to provide more
strategic checks.
Pillar IV: Develop Human Capital
A. Education Attainment Lower Among Rural Poor, Especially Indigenous Groups
Education attainment increased among all demographics in recent years, but attainment in rural
and indigenous areas trails that in urban areas, and the gap between indigenous and nonindigenous i s widening. According to the draft 2007 Poverty Assessment, average schooling
among young adults i s 10.5 years. Urban areas lead the way averaging nearly 12 years, but
attainment falls to about nine years in rural areas and six years in indigenous areas. Differing
attainment rates are attributable to lack o f schools in rural and indigenous areas, weak quality o f
basic and secondary education, and school-related costs that continue to put education out o f
reach for poor households. Preschool enrollment, a key factor favoring retention in later years,
increased from 33% in 1997 to 50% in 2003, but 60% o f poor children are s t i l l not enrolled due
to poor coverage and lack o f human resources for expanding formal programs. In 2003, national
primary enrollment reached 94% and secondary enrollment reached 70%.3 Among the extreme
poor, primary enrollment lagged at 88% in 2003 and secondary enrollment was dramatically less
3

Primary enrollment figures in the CPS are based on the draft FY07 Poverty Assessment calculations from the 1997
and 2003 Living Standards Measurement Surveys. Government data shows that primary enrollment grew from
91.4% in 1990 to 100% in 2005; however, LSMS data i s widely considered more comprehensive as it i s based on a
representative sampling o f households, and reflects widely observed enrollment issues for children of the extreme
poor and the poor, and in rural and indigenous areas.

Annex 2
Page 12 o f 14

at 32%, despite having risen significantly from 19% in 1997. Primary school coverage needs
expansion, but secondary schools are particularly lacking in rural and indigenous areas.
Suboptimal quality and relevancy o f curriculums and language barriers also lower attainment by
fueling high repetition and drop-out rates.

Government Response: To boost education attainment among Panamanians, GOP i s working
to expand coverage o f preschool, primary and secondary education especially in rural and
indigenous areas, including through innovative approaches, such as bilingual education and
video-based distance education for secondary students.
Expand non-formal preschool education to reach poor children. Panama’s National
Strategic Vision prioritizes increasing preschool enrollment from 50% to 75% from 2004 to
2009. Given cost and human resource hurdles, Government i s expanding informal programs
in rural and indigenous areas to provide equal access to the poorest. Bank Contribution
over the ISN. The ongoing Basic Education I1project has established non-formal preschool
education and home-based initial education programs serving nearly 100,000 children,
representing over 50% o f total enrollment.
Improve quality and expand coverage of primary and secondary education to reach poor.
Government has prioritized increasing primary and secondary enrollment and completion
rates between 2004 and 2009 by expanding coverage in poor and rural areas and reforming
curriculums. Bank Contribution over the ISN. The Bank’s draft 2007 Poverty Assessment
analyzed education trends. The ongoing Basic Education I1 project has built 167 new
primary schools, provided scholarships to over 30,000 poor students, and introduced over 90
video-based distance education programs (telebasicas) bringing secondary education to over
4,500 students in rural areas.

The CPS will continue to support these areas and provide assistance to promote sector reform:
> Expand non-formal approaches to preschool education. Additional financing under the
ongoing Education I1 project will support more than 500 additional non-formal and homebased preschool education programs.
> Expand coverage in primary and secondary education and improve s k i l l s training,
including through sector reform. The ongoing Education I1 project will continue
rehabilitation o f primary school infrastructure and expand video-based secondary education
programs in rural and indigenous areas. Sector reform will be addressed in current and
follow-on education projects with a focus on improving sector planning, and establishing and
implementing a comprehensive management information system to strengthen regional and
sector oversight. The planned third project will aim to institutionalize advances in the second
education project and provide greater support for improving the quality o f secondary
education and job training to help ensure l i n k s to the j o b market.
B. Increasing Malnutrition Rates, Especially Among Poor And Indigenous Groups
Panama’s malnutrition rates have climbed in recent years, particularly among poor and
indigenous groups. The national malnutrition rate (height for age) among children under five
increased from 14.3% in 1997 to 20.6% in 2003. Within this trend, however, are clear
demographic disparities. In 2003, only 10% o f non-poor and 14% o f urban children under five
were chronically malnourished, but these rates climb to nearly 19% in rural areas, 40% among
the extremely poor, and over 50% in indigenous areas. Contributing factors to malnutrition are a

Annex 2
Page 13 o f 14

lack o f awareness and knowledge o f nutrition, inappropriate food preparation practices, and a
lack o f simple oral re-hydration solutions to help alleviate diarrhea illnesses. In addition, the
poor and indigenous lack o f access to adequate and varied diet and the means to acquire needed
supplements,

Government Response:
Introduce nutrition programs targeted to extreme poor. To reduce chronic malnutrition in 69 year olds from 22% in 2004 to 15% in 2009, the Government has introduced new early
nutrition intervention programs targeting the extreme poor under the Red de Oportunidades
(RDO). Bank Contribution over the ISN. Demographic analysis o f nutrition status was
part o f the draft 2007 Poverty Assessment.

The CPS will support targeted nutrition programs in rural and indigenous areas:
> Introduce nutrition programs targeted to extreme poor. The recently approved Social
Protection Project will support the development and integration o f a comprehensive protocol
to prevent malnutrition into the Ministry o f Health’s basic package o f health services and the
delivery o f this enhanced package in poor indigenous areas benefiting from cash transfers
under the RDO.

C. Key Health Outcomes Lag Behind Panama’s Peers And Deteriorated Among the Poor
Trends in key health outcomes have not matched progress in middle income countries in the
L A C and have worsened among Panama’s poor. Panama’s child and infant mortality rates
between 1990 and 2004 f e l l about 30% but dropped less than rates in other middle income
countries in the region. Between 1990 and 2000, Panama’s middle income peers in L A C
achieved reductions in maternal mortality, but in Panama maternal mortality appeared to climb
from 55 to 160 per 100,000 live births (at least part o f this change may be attributable to
improved data collection). Among non-poor children, immunization rates rose between 1997
and 2003, but rates dropped among poor and extremely poor children. Diarrhea illness among
non-poor children f e l l about 6% fiom 1997 to 2003, but among the extreme poor increased about
14% to reach nearly 30% in 2003.
Suboptimal or worsening health outcomes are driven by multiple factors. The Ministry o f Health
(MINSA) and the Social Security Institute continue to support fragmented and overlapping
programs, impeding efficient delivery o f quality services and pharmaceuticals in rural areas.
Contracts with NGOs assigned to deliver MINSA’s package o f basic health services (Paquete
Integral de Servicios de Salud - PAISS) in rural areas have been inadequately monitored,
contributing to spotty performance on coverage and service targets. Health clinics and services
are lacking in comarcas and isolated rural areas, and the inability to pay for services remains a
challenge for the poor. Lack o f appropriate consideration o f indigenous peoples’ differing
cultural perspectives on healthcare has also complicated service delivery. Childhood illness has
been exacerbated by limited access to water and sanitation. In 2004, access to improved water
supply was estimated at 75% in rural areas and 56% in indigenous areas, and sanitation coverage
was estimated at only 39% in indigenous areas. Efforts to improve water and sanitation coverage
have been impaired by the lack o f a national policy framework and insufficient coordination
among sector stakeholders, including the National Water and Sewer Agency, the Social
Investment Fund, and MINSA.

Annex 2
Page 14 o f 14

Government Response:
Expand coverage of healthcare services in rural and indigenous areas. Based on the
national Strategic Health Plan, Government i s working to improve healthcare services and
coverage in rural and indigenous areas. GOP i s focusing particularly on increasing the
supply o f health services available to poor households under the Red de Oportunidades CCT
program, which aims to build capacity to meet the basic health needs o f the poor while
protecting household budgets from high out-of-pocket expenditures. GOP i s also seeking to
strengthen the stewardship o f the Ministry o f Health and improve regional management
contracts to better coordinate programs and improve services. Bank Contribution under
the ISN. The draft 2007 Poverty Assessment highlights health challenges and inequities
between the poor and non-poor and between urban, rural and indigenous areas.
Improve water and sanitation coverage in rural areas. To improve water and sanitation
coverage and boost the number o f rural households with access to potable water from 75% in
2004 to 82% in 2009, Government introduced community-driven water programs under the
Red de Oportunidades, and established an inter-institutional committee chaired by MINSA to
improve program coordination and services, Bank Contribution under the ISN. As part o f
the preparation o f the Water and Sanitation project, the Bank supported a national dialogue
on water policy that brought together key stakeholders.

The CPS (FY08-10) will continue to support these areas:

>

>

Expand coverage o f healthcare services in rural and indigenous areas. The recently
approved Social Protection Project will provide support to improve the management and
monitoring o f the Red de Oportunidades, enhance beneficiary participation in the CCT
program, strengthen the supply o f basic health services among beneficiaries, and help
improve social assistance policy-making. A planned new health project will assist the GOP
in improving the performance o f the health system with an emphasis on improving the
efficiency o f regional primary health care networks.
Improve water and sanitation coverage in rural areas. The Water and Sanitation project
will strengthen community water boards, support sustainable water supply and sanitation in
poor rural communities, pilot a sustainable water provision program for small towns,
facilitate better program coordination among government agencies and stakeholders, and
help MINSA and other agencies build their capacity to manage and monitor sector
investments and outcomes. A national initiative to promote handwashing will also be
supported by this project.

CPS Consultations with Panamanian Stakeholders

As part o f the preparation o f this Country Partnership Strategy, formal consultations were
held in Panama City on June 28-29, 2007. These consultations included primarily sectoral
government representatives as well as representatives from business, the international donor
community and think tanks. The Bank team was led by Jane Armitage (Country Director)
and included staff and sector leaders from each key sector. Earlier rounds o f more informal
consultations were held in both M a y and June 2007 during a series o f meetings with local
stakeholders (in the provinces o f Veraguas and Bocas del Toro, and the indigenous comarca
o f Kuna Yala) to solicit views on how ongoing and future Bank activities could more
effectively support the Government's development agenda. In addition, in M a y 2007 the CPS
team convened discussions with a range o f Panamanian opinion-makers to talk about
Panama's development challenges and prospects. Key points from these earlier discussions
were already reflected in the CPS document.

The methodology for formal consultations in Panama City (with over 70 participants)
included introductory remarks by the Bank Country Director and a PowerPoint presentation
o f proposed CPS areas o f emphasis and a listing o f proposed lending and non-lending
activities in support o f the Government's development plan: Visidn Estratkgica de Desarrollo
Econdmico y de Empleo Hacia 2009. Following the presentation, participants broke into four
smaller thematic groups based on the main areas o f Bank involvement: social development;
rural development; public sector modernization and governance; and competitiveness and
investment climate. Each o f the four groups then reported back to the plenary on the results
o f i t s discussions. Stakeholders provided feedback on: (i)
h o w the Bank has most effectively
supported the Government and what approaches have worked less well; (ii)methods that
other organizations in Panama have used effectively that the Bank might consider; (iii)
specific advice for the incoming World Bank Resident Representative; and (iv) how they see
the evolution o f the Bank's interactions with Panama as the national economy continues to
grow.
This approach facilitated productive and frank discussions with the various
stakeholders.
The following i s a summary o f views expressed by stakeholders during the formal
consultations (views are aligned to the pillars o f the Government's Strategic Vision). The
groups raised a number o f general concerns with respect to persistent high poverty levels,
weak institutional capacity, public sector management, provision o f social services, rural
development, land property rights and the environment, competitiveness and the impact o f the
free trade agreement with the United States, as well as broader civil society participation for
consideration by the Government and the Bank's CPS team. Table 1 (below) summarizes the
principal recommendations from this round o f consultations and how the CPS program i s
responding.
Pillar I- Reduce Poverty and Inequality
Participants agreed that sustainable rural development i s a central factor in reducing
inequality in Panama. Participants acknowledged that rural development requires a multisectoral approach. Key elements o f a multi-sectoral strategy should include land tenure,
improving access to basic services and markets, and increasing access to credit by the poor.

Annex 5
Page 2 o f 4

Rural development plans should also strive to promote and empower Panama's small-scale
rural producers to compete in a post-FTA environment. Participants stated that much remains
to be done to improve conditions in rural areas and welcomed the Bank's interventions in this
area, while also encouraging stronger linkages among projects.
Pillar I1 - Promote Economic Growth and Employment

Participants highlighted the importance o f promoting broad-based economic growth and
competitiveness as a way to reduce poverty and promote employment. The issue o f how to
remain competitive (especially in light o f the impacts o f the Panama Canal expansion and the
FTA with the United States) and how to enhance the country's work force, as well as
transportation issues and innovation capacity were o f highest interest to participants. It was
also recommended that both Government and the Bank develop stronger mechanisms to
ensure that the benefits o f economic growth reach the poor, particularly indigenous
populations in rural areas.
Pillars I11 and V - Reform Public Finances and Modernize the State

Participants stressed the importance o f increasing Bank support for institution building to
strengthen the effectiveness o f key public institutions. In addition, participants highlighted
the importance o f supporting reforms and initiatives to promote the establishment o f more
modern and transparent public financial management systems. Improved efficiency and
transparency in Government spending would allow for better delivery o f social services and
encourage an improved investment climate. Participants also recommended that the Bank
play a greater role in strengthening the institutional capacity o f the Government, thereby
contributing to a more effective public sector.
Participants indicated that, despite the Government's successfully reducing the fiscal deficit,
there remain unresolved issues related to the quality o f spending on social services. In this
context, participants emphasized the need to improve the provision o f services through a more
efficient system.
Pillar I V - Develop Human Capital

Participants consider social protection a priority item for investment - it i s a critical element
in reducing poverty and offering opportunity to future generations. Improved health and
education (including bilingual education) were also highlighted as important vehicles to
stimulate economic growth and improve income distribution.
Other Concerns

Lastly, participants in the various groups highlighted their desire to make project design and
implementation procedures more inclusive and participatory (particularly by including
women). In their view, such a shift would enhance the link between development processes
and their beneficiaries. In turn, a more inclusive project culture would also result in
permanent and transparent mechanisms for monitoring and ensuring accountability o f both
projects and public policies.

Recommendations
Sector studies (analytical work) and technical
assistance as the bases for project preparation.

Strengthen institutional capacity in
Government entities executing Bank-financed
projects; improve project implementation.

How they are addressed in the CPS
CPS includes analytical work aimed at building
in-depthsectoral knowledge in areas that will be
supported by Bank projects (e.g., Country
Environmental Analysis as the basis for
Sustainable Tourism Project; see Para. 44 of main
text).
CPS emphasizes building local capacity, including
for project implementation. (see Para. 38)
Ins from other organizations?

Panama, making coordination and
communication a challenge.

Para. 27 of the CPS reflects the Government’s
request that the Bank expand its presence in
Panama by opening a Country Office in early
FY08. The new local presence i s expected to
enhance communication and coordination to
further improve program targeting and
implementation.
The CPS’ two-tiered approach aimed at
strengthening country fiduciary systems (through
technical assistance and policy advice) and
building capacity within Ministries to implement
them i s expected to allow for increased reliance
o n those very systems. (see Para. 38)
Project design will include an exit strategy to
better ensure program sustainability (see Para.

Representative groups o f Panamanians are in the midst o f a national dialogue (facilitated by
UNDP) to agree on a long-term strategy for development and poverty eradication. Central to
this strategy i s determining how best to use the additional income that i s expected to be
generated by the expansion o f the Panama Canal after i t s completion in 2014. While the Bank
i s not a participant in this exercise, Bank staff are following i t s course. Box 1 (below)
elaborates the process and the areas in which various focus groups are focused.

Box 1. National Dialogue for Development
On August 16, 2006, President Torrijos inaugurated the forum for a National Dialogue for Development
(ConcertacMn Nacionalpara el Desarrollo), aimed at designing a plan that w i l l help transform Panama into
a more democratic, equal, and prosperous society, primarily though the correct prioritization o f the use o f the
additional revenue generated by expansion o f the Panama Canal. This dialogue (facilitated b y UNDP)
between the Government and a wide range o f social organizations (including representatives from civil
society, business, academic institutions, political parties, indigenous organizations, women's and youth
groups, as well as sectoral government representatives) seeks to establish long-term strategic objectives and
specific actions in key areas o f development. This forum was originally organized around four thematic
working groups: (i)poverty reduction and equality; (ii)economic growth and competitiveness; (iii)
education; and (iv) institutional strengthening. I t was later agreed to expand the dialogue to include two new
thematic working groups: (v) health; and (vi) justice and personal security. These six working groups are
expected to present their conclusions and suggested actions to President Torrijos later this year.
The following are the focal areas that each working group has designated: (i)Poverty reduction and
equality: expansion, focalization and improved monitoring and evaluation o f public social expenditure;
strengthening o f social protection programs that target vulnerable and indigenous groups; and development
o f sustainable professional training that considers gender equality; (ii) Economic growth and
competitiveness: guarantee fiscal and macroeconomic stability; expand environmentally sustainable
infrastructure to support economic diversification; promote access to services and markets; support policies
that help generate employment; stimulate public-private partnerships to deliver basic services; and encourage
technological innovation; (iii)Education: increase school coverage (both in terms o f enrollment as well as
years o f schooling); improve quality o f education by strengthening curricula; improve teacher training and
pedagogic methods; and expand multicultural and multiethnic education; (iv) Institutional strengthening:
improve transparency and accountability in the provision o f public services; improve access to information
and stimulate civil society participation; professionalize the civil service; and enhance inter-institutional
coordination among public entities; (v) Health: develop a model for the public health system including
management, financing, social participation, and M&E; (vi) justice and personal security: increase access
to justice; reform the judicial system; and increase accountability and transparency.
