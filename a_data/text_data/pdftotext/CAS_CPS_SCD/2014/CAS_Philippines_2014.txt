COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY (FY15‐18)
Executive Summary
Since taking office in 2010, the Government of the Philippines has embarked on an ambitious plan to
bring down poverty and improve the lives of the poorest segments of the population. The Philippines
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY15‐18 supports the government’s plan to promote inclusive
economic growth that creates more and better jobs and reduces poverty. As such, the CPS is fully
aligned with the World Bank Group (WBG) goals of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The
CPS includes an analysis of how growth patterns and underlying government policies have shaped the
country’s development record, notably the limited poverty reduction despite significant economic
growth. This CPS will support structural reforms needed to reverse long‐standing policy distortions –
food security, land reform, competition, labor market and business climate ‐ which have undermined
the creation of more and better jobs and the translation of growth into poverty reduction. High
economic growth rates and a government committed to inclusive growth present a valuable opportunity
for a new growth path. The WBG will deliver a results‐based program with a selective and integrated
package of strategic, analytical, diagnostic and technical assistance services, programs and investment
lending.
Country Context and Challenges
According to the national poverty line, poverty affects roughly 25% of the population. Many Filipinos live
just above the poverty line, cycling in and out of poverty due to high vulnerability to climatic, disaster,
financial and price shocks. Last year alone, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake and a devastating Typhoon
(international name Typhoon Haiyan) caused major damage and a significant increase in poverty levels
in affected areas. Three out of four poor Filipinos live in rural areas and most of them depend on
agriculture. Poor Filipinos belong to households with larger families, have more young‐ and old‐age
dependents, and have less access to basic infrastructure and services. Also, there is a strong nexus
between poverty and violent conflict: the conflict‐affected Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM) is the poorest region with a poverty incidence of 52.9%.
Strong fundamentals have enabled the Philippines to record respectable growth in recent years, despite
the global slowdown. The rapid growth of remittances has also contributed to the economy’s stability.
The country has a strong export sector, a more liberal investment regime, growing transportation and
communication infrastructure, and globally competitive entrepreneurial and managerial talents. The
country can sustain high growth in globally dynamic sectors, such as electronics and business process
outsourcing.
Despite high economic growth, extreme poverty did not significantly decline over the decade through
2012. Extreme poverty, measured as the share of population living under $1.25‐a‐day, was estimated at
19.2% in 2012 compared to 21.6% in 2003. At the same time, while the mean per capita consumption of
the bottom 40% grew faster than the total population (between 2006 and 2009), this segment still lives
below $2‐a‐day. Data and methodological issues raise questions about the reliability of poverty
statistics. Beyond data issues, the limited poverty reduction experienced over the past decade can be
explained by high population growth among the poor; low factor productivity (particularly in agriculture
and services); frequent and severe natural disasters; and persistent conflicts in parts of the country.
Recent preliminary data for the first semester of 2013 shows a 3 percentage points decline in the
national poverty rate compared to the same period in 2012, which may well reflect the positive impact
of scaled up social protection programs. Under the CPS, the Bank will undertake further analytic and
methodological work to better understand poverty trends and their determinants.
vi

The Philippine Development Report 2013 (PDR): Creating More and Better Jobs concluded that
longstanding policy distortions (i.e. in labor markets, land, agriculture) have slowed long term growth in
agriculture and manufacturing. Instead of rising agricultural productivity paving the way for the
development of a manufacturing sector, the converse has taken place. Agricultural productivity has
remained depressed, manufacturing has failed to grow sustainably, and a low‐productivity, low‐skill
services sector has emerged as the dominant sector of the economy. This growth pattern has failed to
provide good jobs to majority of Filipinos, has led to a substantial outmigration of many of the country’s
best and brightest people, and has failed to turn strong growth into poverty reduction.
In the coming years the jobs challenge facing the Philippines will remain formidable. Good jobs ‐ jobs (or
economic opportunities) that raise real wages and bring people out of poverty ‐ need to be provided to
about 10 million Filipinos who were either unemployed (3 million) or underemployed (7 million) in 2012,
and to about 1.15 million potential entrants to the labor force every year from 2013 to 2016. In total,
approximately 14.6 million jobs will need to be created through 2016.
Government’s Development Vision
President Benigno S. Aquino came into power in June 2010, winning with a large margin, on a platform
focusing on good governance, anti‐corruption and poverty reduction. He then entered into a “Social
Contract with the Filipino People” based on: transformational leadership, economy, government service,
gender equality, peace and order, and the environment. After nearly four years in office, the
government has made progress on the reallocation of resources to reform programs in health,
education and social protection and increase budget transparency. Prospects are improving for
sustained peace and development in Mindanao.
The Social Contract is reflected in the 2011‐2016 Philippine Development Plan (PDP) with its theme of
inclusive growth. In April 2014, the government issued the 2011‐2016 PDP Midterm Update. The
midterm highlights the country’s robust economic performance, strong fiscal space and unprecedented
level of international confidence. It also outlines remaining challenges, including slow implementation of
vital infrastructure projects, continued high cost of doing business, and evidence that the benefits of
growth have not turned into greater poverty reduction.
WBG Program and Development Solutions
In support of the PDP, and consistent with the WBG twin goals, the CPS for FY15‐18 aims to promote
inclusive growth, reduce poverty and support shared prosperity.
Selectivity. In line with these goals, the CPS establishes three criteria for selectivity of WBG
interventions: Focus on Poverty and Shared Prosperity; Transformative Engagements; and
Convergence/Multi‐Sector Solutions. The WBG will assess all activities through the lens of inclusive
growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity, utilizing diagnostics to assess the impact of
interventions on the poor and on the bottom 40%. The WBG will evaluate all activities for a
transformational value such as changing behavior and incentives that alter outcomes, a demonstration
effect, and/or a comparative advantage for the WBG. The WBG will support the government’s strategy
of convergence, bringing together teams to break down sector silos. In this context, the Bank will
continue to move away from a sector focus with standalone projects/programs, to programmatic/multi‐
sectoral approaches.

vii

Engagement areas. The CPS is organized in five engagement areas:
1. Transparent and accountable governance: strengthen public finances, fiscal transparency and
financial accountability; strengthen public sector institutions; and strengthen demand‐side
pressure for government accountability.
2. Empowerment of the poor and vulnerable: improve poverty measurement and socio‐economic
data systems; improve health outcomes; improve quality of basic education and access for the
vulnerable; and strengthen social safety nets.
3. Rapid, inclusive and sustained economic growth: strengthen economic policy, support private
sector development, improve the investment climate, including greater access to finance; and
increase economic growth, productivity, and jobs in rural areas.
4. Resilience to climate change, environment, and disaster risk management: increase physical and
financial resilience to natural disaster and climate change impacts and improve natural resource
management and sustainable development.
5. Peace, institution building, and social and economic opportunity: The WBG recognizes the
window of opportunity afforded by recent progress with the peace process and will support
social and economic development in conflict‐affected regions. The WBG will scale up efforts to
increase trust within communities and between citizens and the state in conflict areas and
develop and implement a “Peace Dividend” program for Mindanao/Bangsamoro.
Working as “One WBG”. The CPS program aims to fully leverage the resources and expertise of the
whole WBG (IBRD, IFC and MIGA), particularly to mobilize private sector investment and support job
creation. The WBG will focus on opportunities for transformational engagements, with joint activities
planned in agri‐business, trade logistics, financial sector, and infrastructure/Public Private Partnerships
(PPPs).
The WBG will deliver a focused, selective and integrated package of support, involving analytic/advisory
and financial services. In non‐lending support, the WBG will support integrated analytical and advisory
assistance (AAA) for each engagement area. The majority of new IBRD financing will be for development
policy operations (DPO) and Program‐for‐Results financing. The Bank will no longer support single
agency/single sector investment projects, unless as part of an integrated, multi‐sectoral program. The
indicative lending program for FY15‐FY18 is expected to fall within the range of $600 million to $1 billion
per year, averaging approximately $800 million per year, with firm commitments through the end of
President Aquino’s term (to 2016). Trust funds (about 5% of the total portfolio) will continue to be fully
integrated into the Bank program, with a sharper focus on high priority, strategic areas.
The IFC will continue to support private sector development, access to finance, rural and “green”
investment, and promote inclusive urban growth. The IFC is targeting to commit $250‐300 million in
investments in the next couple of years. MIGA currently has no exposure in the Philippines, but will
continue to explore possibilities for engagement in infrastructure.
Risks and Mitigating Factors
The proposed CPS will face several risks that will need to be mitigated. With presidential elections in
2016, the government will need to navigate between concrete results on the ground and steady
implementation of the longer‐term reform agenda. The Bank will use the opportunity of the CPS
Progress Report (summer 2016) to review and adjust the CPS program. The government’s institutional
and governance reform objectives are complex and require a medium‐ to longer‐term implementation
horizon. The WBG will place a strong emphasis on building constituencies for reform, supporting
viii

stronger client participation, “learning by doing,” and developing institutional capacity. Despite the
encouraging progress on the peace process in Mindanao, political challenges remain and the security
environment remains volatile. As requested by the Government, the WBG will continue to accompany
this process, providing basic social services, livelihood and local institution building, and will be ready to
scale‐up support as the peace process progresses.
To address program delivery risks, the Bank will support better alignment of projects and programs with
government priorities. The Bank has fully mainstreamed all decision making relative to the trust fund
portfolio into the overall IBRD work program decision making process. The recent introduction of
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) will also help to reduce reliance on trust funds and augment the
amount of AAA that can be funded through internal Bank resources.

The Republic of the Philippines
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY (FY15‐18)
Part I ‐ Introduction
1.
High economic growth rates and a government committed to inclusive growth provide the
Philippines with a valuable opportunity for a new growth path that creates more and better jobs and
reduces poverty. The government is looking to the World Bank Group (WBG) to help meet its
development challenges by sharing international experience to effect lasting improvements. In
response, the WBG will deliver a focused, selective and integrated package of strategic, analytical,
diagnostic and technical assistance services, programs and investment lending.
2.
The Philippines Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers FY15‐18 and is fully aligned with the
goals of the Government’s Philippine Development Plan (2011‐2016; PDP) and the Midterm Update
(2014). Accordingly, the overarching goals of the CPS are to promote inclusive growth, reduce poverty,
and support shared prosperity, which are directly linked to the WBG’s twin goals of ending extreme
poverty and promoting shared prosperity. The new CPS is a joint World Bank, International Finance
Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) strategy.
3.
The analytical underpinning of the CPS is the Philippine Development Report 2013 (PDR):
Creating More and Better Jobs,1 which is based on findings from prior PDRs, notably the PDR 2011:
Generating Inclusive Growth to Uplift the Poor. The 2013 PDR analyzes how growth patterns and
underlying government policies in the Philippines have shaped the country’s development record. The
new CPS is aligned with the report’s conclusions and will support the structural reforms needed to
reverse the decades of policies that have undermined the creation of more and better jobs and facilitate
the transformation of growth into poverty reduction.
4.
This CPS has four main parts. After the introduction (Part I), Part II summarizes the country
context and constraints related to poverty and income distribution patterns, progress on social
indicators, the economic and political context, and the government’s development vision of inclusive
growth. Part III presents an evaluation of the effectiveness and lessons from the current Country
Assistance Strategy FY10‐13 and describes the inputs into the preparation of the new CPS. The new
partnership strategy is presented with program selectivity criteria and engagement areas. Finally, Part IV
presents the approach for implementing the CPS with arrangements for monitoring results and risk.
Part II ‐ Country Context and Challenges
A. Poverty
5.
High economic growth in the Philippines over the last decade has not yet translated into
notable poverty reduction. According to the official poverty estimates, which use a national poverty
line as a benchmark, income poverty has remained almost unchanged since 2003 at around 25%
(equivalent to about 24 million Filipinos).. Similar to the overall poverty, the food poverty is high and has

The Philippine Development Report 2013 (PDR): Creating More and Better Jobs is a consensus report reflecting the collective
wisdom of the country’s stakeholders based on extensive consultations that shaped the report’s analysis and recommendations
with over 300 people from government, business, labor, informal sector, academe, and civil society. All WBG sectors
contributed, with IFC providing vital inputs in the area of investment climate. The report also leveraged a number of
international experiences to show that reforms, while difficult, are needed before a country can make growth more inclusive.

been slow to decline. In 2012, the incidence of food poverty was estimated at 10.4% of the population,
suggesting that about 10 million people did not to have sufficient income to meet their basic food
requirements.2
6.
Recent preliminary data shows that poverty declined in the first half of 2013. The latest official
poverty statistics show a 3 percentage point decline in the national poverty rate between the first
semesters of 2012 and 2013, from 27.9 % to 24.9 %. The percentage of food poor Filipinos also
declined from 13.4% to 10.7% in the same period. This decline may well reflect the impact of significant
recent Government efforts to expand economic opportunities and social programs.3

The poverty estimates at the international poverty lines show a modest decline between 2003
and 2012. The share of Filipinos with per capita consumption expenditure below the international
poverty line of PPP $1.25/day, declined modestly from 22.6% in 2006 to 19.2% in 2012. The share of
Filipinos who lived below PPP $2.00/day also declined from 45% in 2006 to 42.2% in 2012. While the
mean per‐capita consumption of the bottom 40% grew faster than the total population between 2006
and 2009 (3.2% versus 1.5 % annually), this group is still very poor living below PPP $2/day.4

Inequality has also declined modestly over the past decade and remains relatively high. In
2012, inequality in income distribution as measured by Gini coefficient was 47.3, only slightly lower than
in 2003 when it was 48.9. Inequality in consumption expenditure distribution is somewhat lower – the
Gini index was 43 in 2012, versus 44 in 2003. Both Gini indices put the Philippines among the countries
with the highest inequality in the region.

2009. Source: Philippine National Statistics Authority, National Statistical Coordination Board, 2014 (www.nscb.gov.ph). The
official poverty estimates in the Philippines use income as welfare aggregate. Preliminary estimates of poverty at international
poverty lines are based on FIES 2012 and were calculated by the World Bank staff.

The 2012 FIES was released by the Philippine Statistics Authority in late March 2014. A full year of APIS 2013 data is expected
to be released later this year. The Bank will use these date sets for the analysis of poverty and shared prosperity.

times higher than in urban areas (3.1%). While less than a quarter of the population derive most of their
income from agriculture, agricultural households—those who depend mainly on income from
agricultural‐related activities—account for half of the country’s poor. Annex 1 provides additional
poverty maps, overlaid with selected Bank beneficiary and/or project data.

At the same time, urban poverty has been increasing in recent years. The urban poverty
incidence increased from 11.3% in 2003 to 13.2% in 2009. With no or low paying jobs, migrants are not
able to afford decent housing and Philippine cities have one of the highest proportions of informal
settlers (about 30 percent reside in Metro Manila).
12.
Many Filipinos live just above the poverty line, cycling in and out of poverty due to high
vulnerability to climatic, disaster, financial and price shocks. A 20% increase in the poverty line
following a major food shock would increase the poverty incidence by over 9%. Between 2003 and
2009, 44% of the population was poor at least once, one in three Filipinos were persistently poor, and
two out of three households moved in and out of poverty. About 90% of the transitory poor have
incomes hovering near the poverty line.

As a means of coping with such shocks, the poor are plunged into deeper levels of
indebtedness to make up for lost livelihoods and income. They reduce spending for health, education
and other basic needs, including decreased food intake. The limited resources that are left are diverted
to meet the most basic needs, constraining the ability to restore pre‐shock incomes and sources of
livelihood. These events also push victims, who previously were not poor, into poverty. Disaster impacts
also tend to differ between men and women: the mortality rates for women are generally higher than
those for men as women are less likely to know how to swim and tend to step in to protect children and
the elderly.6

14.
The year 2013 was a devastating year for the Philippines: a significant earthquake then super‐
Typhoon Yolanda (international name Typhoon Haiyan) caused major damage and a significant
increase in poverty levels in affected areas. On October 15, 2013, the Central Visayas region
experienced a magnitude 7.2 earthquake that affected 3.2 million people, caused 223 casualties,
displaced over 355,000 people, and damaged over 69,000 homes. In November 2013, Yolanda, a
category 5 typhoon with winds speeds over 300 km per hour, struck central Philippines, displacing over
four million people, with over 6,200 reported fatalities and almost 1,800 people still missing.7 Over 1.1
million houses were damaged and half of these were totally destroyed. The immediate impact of
Yolanda on poverty was severe. Estimates are that in the Western, Central, and Eastern Visayas regions,
where the pre‐typhoon poverty rates were significantly above the national average, an additional 2.3
million people (half a million households) were pushed into poverty in the worst affected areas.
15.
Increased vulnerability to natural
disasters has become “the new normal”. The
Philippines is expected to incur (on a long‐term
average basis) about $4.6 billion per year in
damage to assets due to earthquake ground
shaking, tropical cyclone‐induced wind and
precipitation, and non‐tropical cyclone‐induced
precipitation. In the next 25 years, the Philippines
has a 40% chance of experiencing a loss of more
than $18.8 billion and casualties greater than
70,000 people, and a 10% chance of experiencing
a loss of more than $44.8 billion and casualties
greater than 95,000 people.8
16.
There is also a strong nexus between
poverty and violent conflict in the Philippines. In
parts of the country where levels of conflict are high,
poverty is severe. The conflict‐affected Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) is the poorest
region in the country, with a poverty incidence of
52.9% against the national average of 25.2%. The ten
poorest provinces in the country are considered
either conflict‐affected or vulnerable to conflict.

There is some improvement evident in other indicators of poverty. Between 2003 and 2009,
the bottom 40% became more educated as reflected by the gradually increasing share of their
household heads entering and graduating from high school. The share of those in the bottom 40% who
are employed in the industry and services sectors also increased, moving away from the seasonality of
agricultural employment. Consequently, they have become less dependent on agricultural incomes and

informal work, as also reflected by a declining share of households who obtain majority of their incomes
from agriculture‐related activities and the increasing share of households who shift from informal
employment towards wage employment. Some changes are also seen in the living conditions of the
bottom 40% as more of them now build their homes using strong materials and have direct access to
clean water and sanitation. The National Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS) of 2003 and 2008
also show that health indicators of those at the Bottom 40 improved together with the rest of the
population.
18.
The government has revised the original target to halve the official poverty rate from 34.4% in
1991 to 17.2% by 2015, to between 18% and 20% by 2016. This change takes into consideration the
slow response of poverty to economic growth and the setbacks in 2013 due to the impact of disasters.
With 25.2% of the population in poverty in 2012, achieving this goal would require reducing poverty by
5 to 7 percentage points in the next three years. To achieve poverty reduction from 19.23% in 2012 to
15.4% by 2015, based on the rate of extreme poverty measured by using the poverty line of PPP$1.25‐a‐
day, will require an average annual 1.3 percentage point decline. While the latest poverty statistics for
the first semester of 2013 looks promising, achieving either target (national poverty rate or the poverty
line of PPP$1.25‐a‐day) will require additional efforts, particularly in areas with high poverty incidence.
19.
Relative to other countries in the Region, the Philippines has lagged behind in poverty
reduction. In terms of achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the poverty rate at
PPP$1.25 a day between 1990 and 2015, the extreme poverty rate has declined in the Philippines from
30.7% in 1991 to 19.2% in 2012 or by about 38%. In contrast, in China, this rate has declined from 60.2
to 11.8 (by 80%); in Indonesia from 54.3 to 18.1 (by 66%) and in Vietnam from 63.7 to 16.9% (by 73%).
20.
Stubbornly high poverty and inequality in the Philippines over the last decade can be
explained by several factors, including: high population growth, particularly at the bottom of the
distribution;9 low productivity in agriculture, which prevents the poor most of whom are (self)‐
employed in agriculture to earn more and get themselves out of poverty; slow creation of higher
productivity jobs in manufacturing; low human capital formation among the poor; frequent natural
disasters that tend to affect the poorest most severely and push significant numbers of households into
poverty; and persistent conflicts in parts of the country. The pro‐poor policies that have been
implemented by the government such as conditional cash transfers and universal health coverage of the
bottom 40% of the population were fully rolled out in 2013 and their potential impact could not have
been reflected in the 2012 household survey data. Other policies implemented by the government, such
as expansion of basic education services, might take even longer to show any impact on poverty.
21.
Despite the analysis completed to date, the Philippine poverty story remains a puzzle. Why
has there been some decrease in poverty based on the international poverty lines (at least from 2003 to
2009) and based on non‐income measures of poverty, while poverty based on the national poverty line
does not seem to have changed through 2012? There are methodological issues:


Questions have been raised whether the Philippine Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES), on
which all poverty estimates are calculated, accurately captures income and expenditures of the
Philippine households. For example, the consumption expenditures reported by FIES and those
reported by the national accounts have diverged significantly during the last decade. In 2000, the
FIES reported consumption expenditures accounted for 70% of the final household consumption

9

The population in the Philippines has increased from 77.7 million in 2000 to 96.7 million in 2012 or by about 19.0 million
people. According to DHS, the fertility rate in the bottom quintile of the income distribution is 5, while in the top quintile it is
1.8 births per woman in reproductive age.

6

expenditures reported by the national accounts. In 2012, this ratio dropped to only 49%.


There are issues on the sampling frame which is still based on 2000 Population Census, although a
population census was conducted in 2010 and could have been used for sampling of the 2013 FIES.



The poverty line calculation methodology and method for indexing it over time raises questions. For
instance, there is a question regarding the accuracy of prices which are used to calculate and index
provincial poverty lines. A quick look at the provincial poverty lines in 2009 and 2012 suggests that
the poverty line in the National Capital Region (greater Metro Manila) recorded one of the smallest
changes in the nominal poverty line between 2009 and 2012: well below the national average. At
the same time, some provinces for the same basket of goods have recorded an increase of 20% or
even 30% (two‐three times the national average).



Finally, the share of non‐food expenditures in the poverty line is constant, fixed at about 30% across
all provinces. In reality, this share is not constant but varies with the level of provincial mean
income. Keeping the share of non‐food expenditures fixed also implies that non‐food expenditures
are indexed at the food prices and introduces an element of a relative poverty line into poverty
comparisons over time.

22.
Preliminary World Bank staff estimates show that using more consistent alternative poverty
lines yield somewhat greater declines in poverty incidence, gap, and severity especially in recent
years. At the Government’s request, the World Bank will work with the newly established Philippine
Statistical Authority to examine these issues and their impact on the poverty statistics as a priority in the
early part of the CPS implementation period.
B. Other Social Indicators
23.
Progress towards the MDGs in the Philippines is mixed. The country is on track to meet many
MDGs: promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing infant and child mortality,
combatting malaria and tuberculosis, and improved access to safe water.10 However, a number of MDGs
are at risk, including school retention to grade 6, primary education completion, maternal mortality,
births attended by a skilled health professional, and contraceptive prevalence. Annex 2 provides a full
assessment of progress towards the MDG targets.

Despite the projection of meeting the MDG target for water and sanitation in 2015, universal access for rural sanitation will
not be attained until 2035. Further the disparity between urban and rural coverage remains to be sharp. The practice of open
defecation is largely a phenomenon among the poor rural households (NDHS 2008).

7

24.
Overall, the Philippines fares well on gender equality and has recorded gains in the political
participation of women; however, challenges remain related to the attainment of key MDGs affecting
women (as above) and women’s participation in the labor market.11 The Philippines ranked 5th out of
135 countries on the 2013 Global Gender Index, an improvement of its ranking of 8th place in 2012.
School enrollment rates for girls and other education indicators surpass those of boys.12 Despite the fact
that the structures and systems of political parties tend to be male dominated, there has been a marked
increase in the number of women elected to the House of Representatives and in the number of female
mayors. While the judiciary is male dominated (over 60% of justices and judges across all levels are
men), the country marked a significant breakthrough with the appointment of the first female Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court in 2012. Yet, while employment and unemployment rates for men and
women are roughly the same, only about half of women participate in the labor force, compared to
almost 80% of men. Further, women dominate in traditional, socially ascribed careers—household
work, education and health care.
C. Economic Context
25.
Strong fundamentals have enabled the Philippines to record respectable growth in recent
years, despite the global slowdown. The Philippines benefits from strong macroeconomic
fundamentals, manifested by low and stable inflation, falling debt ratios, healthy current account
surpluses, high international reserves, and a stable banking sector. While performance has historically
lagged behind its neighbors, it is now considered a high performer in the region.

The rapid growth of remittances has also contributed to the economy’s stability; even if it
reflects a huge outmigration of many of the country’s best and brightest. The growing supply of
foreign exchange has reversed the country’s past record of recurring current account deficits, and is
now a major support to growth by helping to shore up consumer spending. On average, remittances
account for about 18% of household earned income (i.e., wages and entrepreneurial income, as
opposed to passive income such as remittances and interest from savings) rising to 24% for the top two
income deciles, which account for most overseas Filipino workers. Of the 500,000 college graduates
every year, about 200,000 find jobs abroad. About 10 million Filipinos and their families have left the
country for better opportunities, reflecting both the lack of adequate employment opportunities at
home and the global competitiveness of Filipinos.

27.
A vibrant private sector benefits from structural reforms that the government has embarked
on since the 1980s. These reforms underpin current growth and continued macroeconomic stability
despite weaknesses in the global economy. The reforms include liberalization of key sectors, such as
airlines, telecommunications, and power in the 1990s, followed by financial and regulatory reforms in
the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 and fiscal consolidation in 2005. The country now has a
strong export sector, a more liberal investment regime, growing transportation and communication
infrastructure, and globally competitive entrepreneurial and managerial talents. The country can sustain
high growth in globally dynamic sectors, such as electronics and business process outsourcing. Prior to
the recent global economic slowdown, electronics, consisting mainly of semiconductors and electronic
data processors, accounted for over 50% of merchandise exports. The business process outsourcing
industry is also growing exponentially. The Philippines now ranks as the top destination for voice
support/call centers and has a strong potential to compete in knowledge‐based products in the coming
years.
28.
Despite these strengths, the Philippines has yet to reach its potential due to the lack of
growth in labor‐intensive manufacturing and agriculture sectors. Despite a head start in manufacturing
compared to its neighbors, the country did not industrialize and agriculture failed to reduce poverty
substantially. This situation was the result of low public investment in infrastructure, protectionist
policies (such as a rice import quota that did not stimulate rice production, but did substantially raise
consumer prices), and land reform and administration policies that failed to provide broad and secure
access to land for smallholders and small businesses. Private investment incentives were undermined,
which reduced productivity growth. High food and agriculture input costs contributed to high real wages
and production costs in downstream agribusiness, manufacturing, and services. As a result, the cost of
living increased and employment and real income growth slowed.
29.
Agricultural productivity remained depressed, manufacturing failed to grow sustainably, and a
low‐productivity, low‐skill service sector emerged as the dominant sector of the economy. Modest
agricultural growth was not accompanied by increases in labor productivity. Manufacturing growth was
not impressive, manufacturing labor productivity was stagnant, while key labor‐intensive sub‐sectors,
such as garments, were shedding jobs. Without a rapidly growing manufacturing sector, the service
sector absorbed the excess labor from agriculture. However, more than three‐quarters of the service
sector is composed of low‐wage and low‐skilled jobs, and there has been no increase in productivity in
the service sector.

Decades of underinvestment in physical infrastructure accompanied the slow growth of
agriculture and manufacturing. From close to 30% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the 1970s,
investment in physical capital declined to about 20% of GDP in the last decade. In the public sector, low
tax effort and weak public investment management limited public infrastructure spending to less than
2.5% of GDP annually. Maintenance of existing infrastructure was likewise constrained. The relatively
long foreign investment negative list has limited foreign direct investment (FDI) growth and the
country’s public education and health systems have been underfunded (until recently), holding back
labor force development.
31.
Economic growth and poverty reduction in the Philippines has not benefited from
urbanization gains as much as other neighboring countries. In the last five decades, Philippine cities
and large municipalities have absorbed more than 50 million people. Philippine cities currently share
more than 70% of the country’s GDP. However, other countries in Asia experienced higher growth in
economic output as they become increasingly urbanized. From 1970 to 2006, China and India
demonstrated an average 6% increase in per capita GDP for every 1% increase in urban population while
Vietnam and Thailand exhibited 8% and 10%, respectively. The Philippines, however, showed less than
2% increase per 1% change in population. The country’s urbanization trajectory is uniquely affected by,
among other factors, the archipelagic geography, leapfrogging the industrialization process (i.e., from
agriculture to service sector dominance), and highly fragmented structure for spatial and infrastructure
planning and poor metropolitan governance. Philippine cities have not been able to keep pace with
explosive urban population growth as evidenced in infrastructure and housing deficiencies, traffic
congestion and environmental pollution.
32.
The private sector’s reluctance to invest and create more and better quality jobs reflects the
country’s weak investment climate for firms of all sizes. Investment levels in the Philippines have been
the lowest among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN‐5) members,13 and foreign direct
investment flows have also lagged behind. Among the investment climate constraints, corruption is
viewed as the biggest concern, followed by infrastructure deficiencies and inefficient government
bureaucracy. Costly business and labor regulations have also contributed to weak investment and job
creation.

33.
This pattern of growth has resulted in a much lower pace and quality of job creation relative
to the country’s potential and other similar countries. Unemployment and underemployment rates
have remained stubbornly high at about 8 and 20%, respectively. Men, workers with higher educational
attainment, and the youth have the highest incidences of unemployment, while the poor have the
highest incidence of underemployment. Average real household income in 2009 was lower than in 1997.
Informality is also very high. About 75% of workers do not have written contracts, social insurance, or
access to severance pay. These informally employed workers face varying degrees of vulnerabilities to
income and price shocks.
34.
The lack of good jobs among low‐income earners has contributed to slower progress in
reducing poverty and inequality. The middle class14 is relatively small at around 15% of the population,
of which about a third resides or works abroad. This slow progress in reducing poverty, despite higher
growth in the same period, points to deeper structural problems, which manifest themselves in a
pattern of economic growth that makes poverty reduction stubbornly difficult. Moreover, inequality has
worsened in the last three decades, indicating a growth pattern that does not benefit the poor as much
as it benefits the rich.
35.
In the coming years, the jobs challenge facing the Philippines will remain formidable. Good
jobs—economic opportunities that raise real wages and bring people out of poverty—need to be
provided to about 10 million Filipinos who were either unemployed (3 million) or underemployed (7
million) in 2012, and to about 1.15 million potential entrants to the labor force every year from 2013 to
2016. In total, approximately 14.6 million jobs will need to be created through 2016. In addition, better
jobs need to be provided to another 21 million Filipinos who are informally employed.15 The majority of
the population who are underemployed are rural and in the agriculture sector; the majority of the
unemployed are urban and better educated, including college graduates.
36.
The context and challenges noted above are laid out in the Philippine Development Report
2013 (PDR): Creating More and Better Jobs. In summary, the report concludes the country’s long
history of policy distortions has slowed the growth of agriculture and manufacturing. Lack of
competition in key sectors, insecurity of property rights, complex regulations (related to the labor

market, business environment, etc.), and severe underinvestment by the government and the private
sector in infrastructure have led to this growth pattern. This growth pattern has failed to provide good
jobs to the majority of Filipinos, and has led to a substantial outmigration of many of skilled people.
D. Political Context
37.
President Benigno S. Aquino III came into power in June 2010, winning with a large margin as
candidate of the Liberal Party on a platform focusing on good governance, anti‐corruption and
poverty reduction.16 The president’s election slogan Kung Walang Corrupt, Walang Mahirap (without
corruption there is no poverty) is the focus of his presidency. As part of his electoral campaign, President
Aquino entered into a 16 point “Social Contract with the Filipino People” based on: transformational
leadership (good governance, empowering people, and delivery of health and education services),
economy (inclusive growth, competitiveness and jobs), government service, gender equality, peace and
order, and the environment.
38.
After nearly four years in office, there is a general perception that the president has done well
in implementing the country’s development agenda. He has appointed officials with credible track
records to head key government entities, such as the Supreme Court Justice, the Ombudsman’s Office,
the Commission on Audit and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (all women). Several of the government’s
flagship programs—conditional cash transfers (CCTs), community‐driven development, grassroots
participatory budgeting and Open Data—are promoting good governance by reaching out directly to the
citizens through transparent and accountability‐improving processes.
39.
The government has made considerable progress implementing the Social Contract with the
reallocation of resources to reform programs in health, education and social protection and increased
transparency in budget preparation and implementation, including engagement with civil society
organizations (CSOs) and publication of national government data on a website to promote efficiency
and transparency. In addition, a highly‐controversial Reproductive Health Law and the “Sin Tax” Law
were signed into law in December 2012. There is significant opportunity for further reform, notably
through accelerating the pace of reforms in improving the investment climate, building key
infrastructure for growth, and tackling the strong vested interests that impede inclusive growth.
40.
Prospects are improving for sustained peace and development in Mindanao. In October 2012,
the government signed a Framework Agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The
Agreement lays out a process to establish "the Bangsamoro", a new autonomous political entity to
replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and finalize a peace agreement with the MILF. It is
hoped the Agreement will meet the demands of the Muslim population for genuine autonomy and
contribute to improved security. Key technical annexes to the framework agreement were completed in
January 2014, paving the way for the signing on March 27 of the Comprehensive Agreement on the
Bangsamoro. Two critical steps remain: the passing of the new Bangsamoro law by the Philippine
Congress and its ratification in a plebiscite. If ratified, a Bangsamoro Transition Authority will be
appointed to govern ahead of elections in line with the national schedule in May 2016. As the peace
process continues to progress, the development community has begun to respond to government and
MILF requests to scale up donor support to build capable and accountable institutions that can improve
security and provide jobs. The peace process continues to face some challenges, including threats from
other groups that may feel left out of the consultation process. Other implementation challenges
include strengthening the political leadership when the Bangsamoro Government is created.
16

President Aquino was elected with a strong plurality of 42%, 16 points ahead of the second‐placed candidate. The
Constitution imposes a single‐term limit of six years for the President.

12

41.
The May 2013 midterm elections confirmed strong support for President Aquino’s reform
agenda and established an environment for continued reforms through 2016. The elections were
relatively peaceful, orderly and credible. Voter turnout was estimated at 70% of the 52 million
registered voters. President Aquino’s coalition won 9 of 12 Senate seats, while many of the winning local
chief executives are also aligned with his coalition. Barring exceptional political controversies, President
Aquino is considered well placed to continue to leverage his popularity to implement reforms through
the end of his term. However, the next two years will bring political positioning for the presidential
elections in 2016.
42.
Development in the Philippines is enriched by an active civil society. The Philippine civil society
community, especially nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), is known to be one of the world’s more
vibrant and sophisticated. Many of these organizations are involved in diverse development work at the
operational or advocacy levels and have organized themselves into networks or large coalitions. It is
estimated there are over 95,000 NGOs.17 There are even more civil society groups, mainly peoples’
organizations, operating informally at the local level. Approximately 7,000 groups are doing
development work, either on their own, or in partnership with the government and/or international
development partners. Despite these strengths, the country’s CSOs are largely spread over many issues
and sectors, giving an impression of fragmentation. Recent events that involved channeling of
government funds to non‐existent NGOs have also affected public trust towards CSOs in general, to the
detriment of those that are legitimately working on development programs and issues. The Government
is now working on streamlining the registration process for CSOs to address fraud among CSOs.
E. The Government’s Development Vision
43.
President Aquino’s Social Contract is reflected in the 2011‐2016 Philippine Development Plan
(PDP) with its overarching theme of inclusive growth. The PDP develops the vision of inclusive growth
and poverty reduction through concrete actions that focus on three strategic objectives: (i) attaining a
sustained and high rate of economic growth that provides productive employment opportunities, (ii)
equalizing access to development opportunities for all Filipinos, and (iii) implementing effective social
safety nets to protect and enable those who do not have the capability to participate in the economic
growth process. To achieve sustained and high growth, the PDP calls for a stable macroeconomic
environment, increased infrastructure investment and competitiveness, and improved governance. To
enable broad‐based access to development opportunities, the PDP calls for increased investment in
human capital (education and health) and improved access to infrastructure, finance, land, and other
assets. For effective social protection, the plan lays out the needs for developing effective and
responsive safety nets.
44.
In January 2013, the government issued a Socioeconomic Report: The First Two Years of the
Aquino Administration 2010‐2012, which provides an assessment of progress on the PDP’s strategies
and targets.18 The report concludes that macro‐economic performance is on track, and progress had
been made across a broad range of areas—competitiveness, infrastructure (access to electricity and
water, increased mobile phone access and increased number of schools and public health facilities),
access to finance, protection of the environment and natural resources. The report finds that better
governance is reshaping the landscape of public institutions. In mid‐2013, the Cabinet undertook a
critical internal midterm review, which found that government actions and programs will need more
focus and convergence.

In April 2014, the Government issued the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2011‐2016
Midterm Update.19 The Midterm Updates highlights the country’s robust economic performance, strong
fiscal space and unprecedented level of international confidence. It also outlines remaining challenges,
including slow implementation of vital infrastructure projects, continued high cost of doing business,
and most fundamentally, evidence that the benefits of growth have not yet turned into poverty
reduction. “The challenge for the remainder of the plan period … is to ensure that economic growth will
be sustained, … is inclusive; that it will result job creation of the productive and remunerative kind and
lead to the reduction of poverty in its multiple dimensions.”20 The Midterm Update revises the poverty
target based on the national poverty line to between 18 and 20% by 2016 to take into consideration the
slow response of poverty to economic growth and the setbacks in 2013 due to the impact of disasters.
It also highlights the spatial dimension of poverty, focusing government interventions on provinces
chosen by: the number or magnitude of poverty, the provincial poverty incidence and the province’s
vulnerability to natural disasters, with the type of intervention determined by the type of poverty or
vulnerability.
Part III ‐ Lessons from the Current CAS, Client Survey and Multi‐stakeholder Consultations
A. Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Completion Report
46.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the WBG’s current CAS in achieving its objectives was
completed to inform preparation of the CPS (Annex 3). The last CAS, a joint IBRD/IFC/MIGA strategy
(FY10‐13), carried the theme of Making Growth Work for the Poor.21 The CAS supported country‐level
development goals through five strategic objectives: maintaining a stable macro‐economy, improving
the investment climate, better public service delivery, reduced vulnerabilities, and good governance.
Overall, progress towards achieving the CAS outcomes was rated as satisfactory, and WBG performance
was rated as satisfactory. The enabling environment for WBG engagement transformed over the CAS
period, benefitting from strong government leadership and the capacities, programs, and reforms put in
place during the CAS period. The evaluation concludes that the WBG should continue to address the
reforms initiated during the CAS period.
47.

The key lessons from the FY10‐13 CAS include:



Improvements in governance require concerted efforts to build constituencies for continued
reforms. The government’s flagship programs, such as the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program,
the community driven development program, and Bottom‐Up Budgeting, have attempted to break
the nexus of local patronage politics, replacing them with more transparent and accountable public
service delivery. The Bank should continue assisting the government in designing and monitoring the
impact of these programs. It is also important to help build a broad base of constituents inside and
outside the government who demand a continuation of reforms beyond the end of the current
administration in 2016.



Analytical and Advisory Services (AAA) should remain at the heart of the WBG program. WBG
financing is useful to the extent to which it can consolidate policy reform, provide funding for the
delivery of important programs, or experiment and generate learning that can inform better
planning and decision‐making. As the country's economy has grown and the WBG financing has

The CAS was extended by a year (from FY12 to FY13) in the CAS Progress Report, shared with the Board in May 2010.

14

become relatively less significant, the analytical, advisory and experimental agenda will become
even more important.


The focus on governance risks should be mainstreamed into existing WBG processes and
approaches, rather than through separate governance filters. Given the government’s strong
commitment to improving governance, the Bank needs to more systematically support good
governance, through all its operations, governance focusing particularly on strengthening service
delivery for the poor and the vulnerable. The Bank also needs to invest more in understanding the
political and institutional constraints to stronger pro‐poor outcomes and improved service delivery,
by more systematically addressing knowledge gaps, to better inform project design and
implementation, and to maximize development results.



The WBG will need to be more selective to avoid spreading itself too thinly. Given the resilience of
many core development challenges in the Philippines and the relatively small size of the WBG
program compared to the economy and resource constraints, the WBG should focus its efforts on
strategically important interventions that support big development impacts, using pioneering
investments, working with partners who share the WBG’s focus on sustainability, and considering
opportunities for the Bank to leverage in greater investments from the private sector and other
development partners.



Availability of timely, quality data is still a serious constraint to policymaking and the monitoring
and assessment of performance. The Bank will step can play a role in helping to address low quality
poverty data statistics, strengthening the capacity of the National Statistics Office, and modernizing
government financial management information systems.
B. Feedback and Dialogue Mechanisms

48.
The CPS preparation was informed by various feedback and dialogue mechanisms. A client
survey was undertaken in the third quarter of 2012, and a series of formal and informal meetings were
undertaken in various parts of the country, bringing together civil society representatives, national and
local government officials from oversight and implementing agencies, academia, members of the
legislature and other development partners. (Summaries included in Annex 4.)
Part IV ‐ The New World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy FY15‐FY18
A. CPS Goals, Analytic Underpinning and Structure
49.
The goals of the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Philippines are to reduce
poverty, promote shared prosperity, and support inclusive growth. These goals are in line with PDP’s
focus on inclusive growth, defined as poverty reduction in multiple dimensions and massive creation of
quality employment as the desired outcome, as well as with the WBG’s goals of eliminating extreme
poverty by 2030 and supporting shared prosperity. Sustained growth is critical for poverty reduction and
shared prosperity. However, as the recent poverty statistics show, despite the high economic growth in
recent years and the government’s strong commitment to inclusive growth, poverty has not declined
significantly. The government has turned to the WBG to help understand and address this challenge.
How can the government’s program be refined to sharpen the focus on, and geographically target,
poverty reduction? What actions can be taken to ensure that growth directly improves the lives of the
poor and vulnerable, recognizing the deep‐seated structural poverty and high levels of vulnerability?
How can the poor participate in sustaining a higher growth rate? How can the Government speed the
efficient and effective implementation of infrastructure investments and post‐disaster (Typhoon Yolanda)
reconstruction?

15

50.
The WBG will draw from the extensive global and Philippine knowledge base to accompany
the government in better understanding and addressing the growth‐poverty dynamic, explicitly taking
into account the country’s governance challenges. The WBG program will build on the analysis and
conclusions presented in recent flagship reports, including the World Development Reports (WDRs)
(2013 WDR: Jobs, 2011 WDR: Conflict, Security and Development, 2010 WDR: Development and Climate
Change, and 2008 WDR: Agriculture for Development), recent Philippine Development Reports (PDR
2010: Generating Inclusive Growth to Uplift the Poor and PDR 2013: Creating More and Better Jobs), and
the IFC Jobs Study: Assessing Private Sector Contributions to Job Creation and Poverty Reduction (January
2013). The inclusive growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity objectives will be applied to all
areas of engagement, assessing the extent to which an integrated package of activities—dialogue, AAA,
advisory, lending and investment—helps promote poverty reduction.
51.
The CPS builds on the Social Contract and the PDP and the PDP Midterm Update. The CPS is
organized around the five key results areas of the Social Contract: (a) transparent, accountable and
participatory governance; (b) empowerment of the poor and vulnerable; (c) rapid, inclusive and
sustained economic growth; (d) climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk management
(DRM) and environmental protection, and (e) security, justice and peace.22 The CPS includes a limited
role for the Bank in this last area, limiting engagement to social and economic development in the
conflict affected regions, as the broader definition falls outside the mandate and comparative advantage
of the WBG in the Philippines. Figure 18 is the results chain for the WBG program.
52.
The CPS program aims to fully leverage the resources and expertise of the WBG (IBRD, IFC and
MIGA), particularly to mobilize private sector investment and promote job creation. IBRD, IFC and
MIGA will focus on opportunities for joint transformational engagements, with a focus on key sectors:
agri‐business (with initial focus on Mindanao/Bangsamoro), trade logistics, the financial sector, water,
and infrastructure/Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).
B. Criteria for Selectivity of Bank Group Intervention
53.
The CPS introduces specific criteria for selectivity of the World Bank Group program, consistent
with the new WBG strategy and the CPS Completion Report lesson noted above.
54.
Criteria 1: Focus on Poverty and Shared Prosperity. The WBG will assess all activities through
the lens of inclusive growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity, utilizing key diagnostics to assess
the impact of planned interventions on the poor.


22

Poverty Data and Diagnostics. The Bank will support heightened government efforts to track
poverty, to use enhanced poverty targeting for its development programs, and to support poverty
analysis and impact evaluations to improve program and project design. Expanding the focus to
track the experience of the poorest 40% will be particularly important in the Philippines given that
approximately 40% of the population lives below the $2/day poverty line and, as previously noted, a
large percentage of the population falls in and out of poverty.

As laid out in Executive Order No. 43, s. 2011. Published: May 13, 2011. Latest update: July 22, 2012.

WBG Program and Project Targeting and Review – Geographic Targeting for Poverty Reduction.
Inclusive growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity will be the overall focus of project and
AAA, pipeline, program and portfolio and reviews. Consistent with the Government’s new
geographic approach under the PDP Midterm Update, the Bank will use the “Mapping for Results”
technology to assess the extent to which activities (existing and proposed) collectively focus on the
poor and the poorest regions of the Philippines and provide a package of support in a
complementary manner. The current portfolio has now been mapped and this will also be used in
our dialogue at both the program and sector levels going forward, with government, and the
broader development community. See Annex 1 for illustrative project/poverty maps.

55.
Criteria 2: Transformative Engagements. The second criterion is the extent to which the
program/activity is truly transformational. Does it address a binding constraint? Will it lead to changes in
behavior and incentives that alter outcomes? Does it maximize impact? Does it have demonstration
effects, including the potential for replication and influencing other actors, scaling up and spillover, or
does it serve a catalytic role? Will it have lasting impact beyond the intervention horizon? Finally, does it
offer a unique opportunity for the WBG based on comparative advantage?
56.
Criteria 3: Convergence/Multi‐Sector Solutions. The Bank will explicitly support the
government’s strategy of convergence, bringing together teams to break down sector silos. The
government has recognized that the only way to make inroads in inclusive growth and poverty reduction
is to work across sector boundaries. The government is bringing together sector ministries and programs
(horizontal convergence), and national and subnational governments (vertical convergence), to work
together in a collaborative manner to address the country’s complex and integrated development
challenges. Multi‐sector programs have already been developed for two geographic areas with high
levels of poverty and specific development needs: Mindanao/Bangsamoro (high poverty rates) and
Metro Manila (high numbers of poor people). The Bank will continue to explore new opportunities for
convergence/multi‐sector projects and programs as this integrated approach should lead to a better
understanding of complex, interconnected development challenges, increase the sustainability of
reforms, programs and projects, and support inclusive development.
57.
Implementation of the Selectivity Criteria. Selectivity will be applied from strategy
development, throughout the program, project and AAA/Advisory development and implementation
processes. Selectivity will be taken into account in the choice of engagement area, choice of
activities/instruments, and in the design of each activity. In each case, the country team needs to show
that the proposed engagement or activity addresses a key constraint to poverty reduction and/or shared
prosperity, based on solid analytics, and clear evidence. In many cases, the teams will be drawing
directly from the conclusions/recommendation of the Philippine Development Reports (Inclusive
Growth and/or Jobs), or other key diagnostics. They will also need to utilize enhanced poverty analyses
(as they come available or including enhanced diagnostics in project preparation, if needed) and use the
mapping for results technology to drive program/project design, to maximize impact on the poor and
the bottom forty percent. They need to make the case as to how this will be a “transformative
engagement” (responding to the questions noted above), and to show how they are addressing key
development constraints. This requires multi‐sector teams drawn from across relevant global practices,
and in some cases, from across the WBG (see also Box 1 below). Finally, the team needs to be assured
that a reform coalition of key stakeholders is present, including several relevant senior policy makers
(notably from the oversight agencies) and key actors from the private sector and civil society.
58.
Impact of Selectivity/Change in Bank Program From the last CPS. The Bank program is moving
away from a focus on sectors with standalone projects/programs, to multi‐sectoral approaches focused

on development outcomes. Transport is now only pursued as part of integrated urban and rural
development; water and sanitation are only pursued as part of improved health outcomes, natural
resource and disaster risk management; and energy is only pursued as part of improved economic
management and natural resource management. And the Bank no longer directly support the justice
sector. A proposed health sector operation was dropped, as the Bank and Government are moving away
from health service delivery to the broader focus on health outcomes through multi‐sector
engagements (water and sanitation, education, nutrition and health). As a result, the IBRD will no longer
support single agency, standalone sector investment projects, unless as part of an integrated, multi‐
sectoral program. The Bank will delivery only 1‐2 multi‐sectoral projects per year, with clear geographic
targeting, in addition to the annual series of development policy operations. This will be reflected in the
overall CPS program as the older projects/programs exit the portfolio, and new projects/programs are
approved.
C. Other Key Principles of WBG Engagement
59.
WBG role in the Philippines. The WBG will work to maintain its role as a trusted partner of the
government for policy advice and for access to global knowledge and solutions, particularly in complex
and sensitive policy areas. The WBG will remain a comparatively small financial player compared to
overall government and private sector resources. The government has asked the WBG to help develop a
sharper understanding of the country’s complex development challenges and then to support the
piloting of innovative solutions (with IBRD financing, IFC investments, and MIGA guarantees, as
appropriate), with government then scaling‐up successful programs to the national level. The Bank and
Government have done this successfully for the CDD program, the CCT program, among others. This
approach underscores the need for an integrated package of assistance to government and the private
sector, combining access to global knowledge and solutions with IBRD, IFC, MIGA and trust fund
financing. Coordinated knowledge, technical assistance and lending activities will increase impact and
reduce fragmentation of staff work programs and demands on government. But, innovation, flexibility
and speed of response are critical.
60.
Governance. Good governance remains a key focus for the WBG program, as it remains a
central development challenge in the Philippines. Through the first half of the Aquino administration,
there was a significant improvement in the country’s ranking on external indices relating to good
governance and corruption, and in domestic perceptions of corruption and governance. However, the
country’s overall low ranking reflects the fact that poor governance remains a major impediment to
inclusive growth and poverty reduction, as noted in the President’s election platform as well as his latest
State of the Nation Address. The government recognizes this and has given high priority to
implementation of a coherent Good Governance and Anti‐Corruption Action Plan. The WBG is
mainstreaming governance across the WBG program, investing in understanding the political economy
and institutional constraints to stronger pro‐poor outcomes and improved service delivery,
systematically identifying and addressing the gaps in the Bank’s knowledge base, and supporting geo‐
tagging, mapping and publication of information to improve governance at the project level. The Bank
will continue to expand the engagement on governance beyond the individual project level to programs
that support institutional change and transformation within sectors and across the economy.
61.
Stronger World Bank Group Collaboration. Recognizing the need to work closely together for
better results, collaboration will intensify across the IBRD, the IFC, MIGA and the World Bank Institute
(WBI). Joint IFC‐IBRD‐MIGA coordination will be pursued in a focused manner in key sectors (see Box 1
and Annex 5). The WBI will focus on capacity development interventions around three main areas:
Leadership, Social Accountability, and Urban programs (see Annex 6).

19

Box 1: One World Bank Group in Action
WBG collaboration in the Philippines is being pursued in a focused manner through enhanced
coordination mechanisms and joint activities in key sectors, notably: agribusiness in Mindanao,
access to finance, trade logistics, and access to water and sanitation. Collaboration has been
facilitated and intensified with the co‐location of IFC and WB offices in Manila in early 2012.
Coordination Mechanisms. IFC participates in the weekly IBRD country management team meetings
to track progress in the key sectors, and to identify other opportunities for enhanced collaboration as
work programs evolve. The IFC‐IBRD country team will participate in a joint learning event in late
FY14 to develop a common understanding of the full menu of WBG instruments, including an
understanding of the processes followed for project and AAA/advisory services preparation,
implementation and evaluation. Implementation of the CPS will include annual joint business
planning and joint monitoring and evaluation of the CPS program.
Example: Promoting agri‐business in poor rural areas, with an initial focus on
Mindanao/Bansamoro. A joint IFC‐IBRD team is working to increase private sector investment, job
creation and livelihoods for the rural poor in areas with high poverty, with initial focus on Mindanao
in support of the peace process. The IFC is working to identify firms interested in investing in these
regions, and working with them to formulate an investment strategy and business plan. IFC helps to
define the specific public goods that need to be provided to make the investments financially
attractive, including investments in road, port and air transport facilities, irrigation and water supply
systems, farm to market roads, and basic community infrastructure for the beneficiary communities.
The WBG then uses its convening power to bring together the private sector firms and the different
levels of government. Working with the national Government, the Bank is providing the financing
mechanisms for the supporting infrastructure. It will also help to provide extension services where
necessary, and mobilization of local governments for the provision of services.
The joint WBG approach supports a key banana production and export investment in the conflict‐
affected Bangsamoro region. Working with a well‐established company, the proposed IFC
investment will create 4,000 hectares of new farms and generate 6,000‐7,000 jobs over three years,
a large proportion of which will employ ex‐combatants of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. IBRD
support will be provided through existing and pipeline IBRD‐financed operations. This initiative will
support efforts to achieve peace and stability and address unemployment and poverty in the
Bangsamoro and help build private sector confidence and governance to provide citizen security,
justice and jobs to break the cycle of conflict and poverty.
Additional detail on WBG collaboration is included as Annex 5.
62.
Partnerships: The WBG will continue to coordinate with development partners, civil society,
academia and the private sector to reduce overlap and/or duplication of effort, reduce transaction costs
and maximize impact. The Bank will continue to draw on its convening power to support government
efforts to coordinate the local development community through the Philippine Development Forum and
its working groups and thematic areas (see Annex 7). The Bank will also continue to deepen its
engagement on Open Development through partnerships with key academic and research institutions
that form the network of Knowledge for Development Centers. The CSO Advisory Group and the
Development Partners Focus Group will continue to be important mechanisms to inform the WBG on
key Philippine development issues.

20

Box 2: World Bank Group Support in the Wake of Typhoon Yolanda
The WBG’s response to Typhoon Yolanda, which struck the Philippines on November 8, 2013, offers
a recent example of CPS criteria and key principles in action. Multi‐sector teams from across the
WBG quickly coalesced to provide strong and timely support to the government, coordinating closely
with development partners on the ground.
Technical Assistance/Global Knowledge: The Bank drew on its vast experience with post‐disaster
recovery and reconstruction, sharing lessons of experience from places such as Turkey, Indonesia, Sri
Lanka, Pakistan and Haiti, among others. The Bank put top global experts at the government’s
disposal within days of the typhoon—including experts in remote sensing technology, housing
reconstruction resilient design standards, and reconstruction of public facilities and infrastructure—
to support a rapid damage and loss assessment and to provide inputs to the design and
implementation of the government reconstruction plan, Reconstruction Assistance to Yolanda. The
WBG continues to provide technical assistance in the new CPS.
IBRD Financing. The Bank quickly prepared an emergency project: a $500 million Supplemental
Financing for the Second Development Policy Loan (DPL) to Foster more Inclusive Growth for Post
Typhoon Recovery Project was approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on
December 6, 2013 on an emergency basis. The Bank is working with the government to restructure
several ongoing IBRD‐financed projects for urgent rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure,
public facilities and shelters, in the range of $100‐140 million (with the potential to leverage
substantial additional budget resources) and to refocus two new investment operations to address
needs in areas affected by the typhoon: a $480 million National CDD Project (NCDDP), which will
help poor communities build basic social services (water, schools, health facilities, roads and
bridges), with about 60 percent of the project to support typhoon‐affected communities (approved
by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in February 2014) and a project for agriculture and
fisheries (the Philippine Rural Development Program – PRDP; for Board consideration in early FY15).
International Finance Corporation. The IFC supported the post‐disaster needs assessment, focusing
on determining what is needed to restore private sector activities. The IFC assessed credit services
and sectors of the local economies in Northern Cebu and Northern Iloilo, among the most severely
affected areas. The IFC will also support the recovery and reconstruction process, offering financing
to banks to provide loans to micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) and retail clients in
affected areas, including refinancing existing loans, new loans for the recovery of property, working
capital loans for MSMEs and housing loans or home improvement loans for consumers. Advisory
services will be made available to banks to help revive MSMEs and increase resilience, with direct
support to companies in the real sector, offering financing for power transmission/generation, and
for rebuilding hotel and retail facilities in affected areas.
D. Engagement Areas and Strategic Outcomes
Engagement Area 1: Transparent and Accountable Government
63.
Two interrelated factors explain the less than optimal public investments in inclusive growth:
weak domestic revenue mobilization and weak political accountability to deliver on public investments.
Weak domestic revenue mobilization results from a complicated tax system with high rates, but a
narrow base. Tax evasion, corruption, and a proliferation of largely redundant tax incentives have
undermined the emergence of a broad based and effective revenue policy and administration regime.
And the quality of public spending programs for inclusive growth has been undermined by vested
interests and weak implementation capacity. Adverse public perceptions about the quality of public
spending and governance at both the national and local level have undermined the broadening and
21

deepening of the tax base. Finally, fiscal risks from natural disaster or contingent liabilities, if not
properly managed, can undermine the fiscal sustainability of priority spending programs for inclusive
growth.
Outcome 1.1 Strengthened Public Finances, Fiscal Transparency and Financial Accountability
Development Constraint: Lack of adequate transparent, effective, and timely financing of public
services for inclusive growth
Strategic Outcome: Strengthened Public Finances, Fiscal Transparency and Financial Accountability
Indicators:
 Revenue gaps23 for specific, key commodities estimated and mitigation plan developed and pursued
 Fiscal incentives reform advanced –the annual Tax Expenditure Statement (TES) published on‐line,
with progressive coverage of all investment incentives
 The Annual Fiscal Risk Statement is published as part of budget preparation, with forward looking
risk scenarios (with reference to quantification of government‐owned and controlled corporations
(GOCCs), public‐private partnerships (PPPs), natural calamities, and other exposures)
64.
The Bank will support: (i) efforts to streamline poorly targeted fiscal incentives and exemptions
to reduce unnecessary revenue losses and create a level and equitable playing field for corporate and
individual tax payers; (ii) enhance public financial management through the key reform measures set out
in the Public Financial Management Action Plan including systems strengthening Government Financial
Management Information System and Treasury Single Account; (iii) enhance tracking of budgets and
execution, notably through the implementation of the Unified Account Code Structure (UACS) to
increase confidence that available fiscal space on both the revenue and expenditure side is being
optimized for supporting inclusive development; (iv) excise tax reform implementation to improve fiscal
space for priority Social Contract priorities; (v) improved market‐based risk management; and (vi) the
introduction of financing tools (including facilitating access to derivative and capital market solutions for
managing sovereign‐ and subsovereign‐level risks) to help the Philippines manage vulnerabilities to
external shocks associated with market volatility and natural disasters, protecting fiscal sustainability in
the process. The Bank will also continue to partner with the Filipino Treasury to strengthen its debt and
risk management framework and with Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank) on reserve
management. Bank support to this outcome area is provided through integrated AAA (see Attachment 1
for details) and the annual series of Development Policy Operations (DPOs).
Outcome 1.2 Strengthened Public Sector Institutions
Development Constraint: Poor and captured public services resulting in weak infrastructure, human
development, and regulatory outcomes
Strategic Outcome: Strengthened Public Sector Institutions for Service Delivery
Indicators:
 International benchmarks on budget transparency and credibility (Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) Scores)
 Number of agencies delivering on Social Contract priorities, by indicators developed for each agency/
program
 Increased timeliness of public disclosure of local government unit (LGU) benchmarking, including Seal
of Good Housekeeping24 indicators/recipients
23

The revenue gap is estimated by comparing exports reported by other countries to the Philippines with the imports the
Philippines reports. If the latter is lower, this would suggest a gap. The revenue gap is the product of the quantity gap times the
customs rate.

22

65.
The Bank will support the accountability and delivery of public services by national and local
actors (National Government Agencies, Public Service GOCCs, and LGUs), and improving institutional
incentives and capabilities to oversee, regulate, and deliver public goods and investments. The Bank will
support both cross‐cutting systems reforms (including Government Integrated Financial Management
System ‐ GFMIS), while advancing results at the sector level. Entry points include supporting: (i)
enhanced sector budget credibility and execution in agriculture, infrastructure, health and education,
and (ii) a more capable and responsive civil service through a reform of Rationalization Plan/Agency
Modernization Framework and the implementation of the Performance‐Based Bonus Scheme.
66.
The Bank will help build government capacity for reform prioritization, sequencing, and
implementation, with the overall goal of putting the government in a stronger position to leverage
private sector and civil society coalitions for reforms. The Bank will support strengthened planning‐
investment programming‐budgeting linkages in the urban system. The Bank will also continue to support
implementation of LGU benchmarking initiatives such as the Seal of Good Housekeeping,24 including
through support to potentially transformative national programs such as Grass Roots Participatory
budgeting. The WBG will also work closely with government institutions and development partners to
strengthen key accountability institutions and regulations to improve the quality of internal audit,
financial management and procurement, helping to build trust in government through strong and
accountable stewardship of public resources. As part of this process, the Bank will incrementally
increase reliance on the use of country systems. Bank support to this outcome area is provided through
integrated AAA, the annual series of DPOs, and IBRD‐financed projects that operate at national and sub‐
national levels, including the NCDDP and the National Roads Improvement and Management Phase 2
(NRIMP‐2).
Outcome 1.3 Strengthened Pressure for Government Accountability
Development Constraint: Limited pressures for public sector to perform and capture by vested
interests reduces targeting and impact of government programs
Strategic Outcome: Strengthened Pressure for Government Accountability
Indicators:
 % of households in targeted municipalities with at least one member attending regular Barangay
Assemblies
 Preparation and public disclosure of integrated monitoring reports on Local Poverty Reduction
Action Plans for all participating cities and municipalities
 Increase in the Open Budget index score
67.
The Bank will support government efforts to strengthen social accountability, using information
and communication technology (ICT), public resource allocation and service delivery priorities, and civil
society/citizen demand‐side pressures. The Bank will continue to support the Philippines Open
Government Data Initiative,25 supporting enhanced feedback platforms for flagship programs (e.g., basic

The Philippines is one of the eight founding members of the Open Government Partnership, a global initiative that aims to
secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness
new technologies to strengthen governance. In January 2014 the Government launched the Philippines Open Government Data
Initiative. They have established a national public information repository (data.gov.ph) to serve as the primary platform by
which government data and information will be published.

infrastructure reconstruction, reconstruction) through the development of sectoral open service
delivery platforms. The WBG will support the Philippines as a candidate country in the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).26 The Bank will also support the deepening of PhilGeps
procurement disclosure, the institutionalization of the Full Disclosure Policy, and the scale‐up of capacity
building programs for civil society and academe to access and utilize the disclosed government data and
reports. At the sub‐national level, the Bank will support stronger participatory mechanisms for planning
and budgeting at the municipal/city and barangay levels. Bank support for this outcome area is provided
through integrated AAA, the annual series of DPOs, NCDDP and the proposed PRDP.
Engagement Area 2: Empowerment of the Poor and Vulnerable
Outcome 2.1 Improved Poverty Measurement and Strengthened Socio‐Economic Data Systems
Development Constraint: Lack of timely, disaggregated data constrains government’s ability to target,
monitor and evaluate programs to maximize impact
Strategic Outcome: Improved Poverty Measurement and Strengthened Socio‐Economic Data Systems
Indicator: Increased frequency and timeliness of national poverty statistics
68.
The Bank will support government’s efforts to produce accurate, good quality, disaggregated
data on poverty and welfare of the poor more frequently and in a timely manner. The Bank will prepare
a full poverty assessment based on the 2012 poverty data sets, to better understand the nature of
poverty in the Philippines including (but not limited to): poverty trends based on both national and
international poverty lines (and to understand the differences between them), inequality, spatial
dimensions, socio‐economic characteristics, non‐income measures of poverty, gender differences, etc.
The Bank (in collaboration with other development partners, local universities, and the international
community of experts) will strengthen the analytical capacity of key government offices to use statistics
for evidence‐based policymaking, improve business statistics and the compilation of the national
accounts, improve household statistics and the production of poverty and employment statistics, and
enhance data archiving/management, statistical planning and budgeting. Bank support for this outcome
area is provided through integrated AAA, the annual series of DPOs, and through the Social Welfare and
Development Reform project (SWDRP).
Outcome 2.2 Improved Health Outcomes
Development Constraint: Limited access to quality basic services (health, water and sanitation)
undermines quality of life, reduces access to opportunities, and perpetuates poverty
Strategic Outcome: Improved Health Status
Indicators:
 Increasing health insurance coverage for Listahanan‐identified poor households under the
Sponsored Program (gender disaggregated)
 Indicator(s) on improved health outcomes and increased access to water and sanitation services will
be added at the time of the CPS Progress report
69.
There have been improvements in health status and access to care, but progress has been
uneven and slow. As noted in Part II, the Philippines is not on track to meet specific MDGs that directly
26

President Aquino committed to implementing the EITI Standard in July 2012. After establishing the multi‐stakeholder group
in January of 2013, the Philippines submitted its Candidature Application to the EITI International Secretariat on 5 April 2013. In
May 2013, the EITI Board approved the Philippine application and declared the Philippines an EITI Candidate country.

affect women, notably those related to maternal mortality, the proportion of births attended by a
skilled health professional and contraceptive prevalence. There are significant inequalities in health
status across poor and non‐poor households, across regions, and between urban and rural areas. Ill
health and the cost of care are major causes of impoverishment. Like many middle income countries,
the Philippines faces dual challenges, including an infectious disease burden accompanied by a
significant rise in non‐communicable diseases, the co‐existence of under‐nutrition and over‐nutrition,
and availability of world‐class tertiary care while many people still lack access to basic health services.
70.
The government is pursuing universal health care (UHC) to ensure that all have access to quality
health care, especially the poorest, while being protected from the financial risk associated with health
care costs. The WBG will support better access to health services for the poor, focusing on their effective
coverage by UHC scheme, increasing their knowledge and awareness of benefits and entitlements,
aligning the content and quality of services to the health care needs of the poor, and ensuring readiness
of the supply side to provide services. This is expected to lead to increased access to/and utilization of
services. The WBG will support building public‐private partnerships in health, and more integrated and
cross‐sectoral health initiatives at the national and local government levels, addressing the impact of
environmental pollution, under‐ and over‐nutrition, safe water and adequate waste management, and
health education can have on health outcomes. The Bank will support the development of sustainable
water and sanitation services and the IFC will focus on enhancing private sector participation in the
water and sanitation sector through investment support and transaction advisory services for PPPs. The
Bank is also working closely with the United Nations and the Government to better understand why the
Philippines is not on track to meet the MDG on maternal mortality, and to implement concrete actions
to accelerate progress. Bank support for this outcome area is provided through integrated AAA, NCDDP
and possible new IBRD‐financed project(s) for integrated health outcomes.
Outcome 2.3 Improved Quality of Basic Education and Improved Access for the Vulnerable
Development Constraint: Limited access to quality education undermines quality of life, reduces
access to opportunities, and perpetuates poverty
Strategic Outcome: Improved Outcomes for Quality of Basic Education and Improved Access to
Education for the Vulnerable
Indicators:
 Decrease of students with scores of zero in the relevant Early Grade Reading Assessment mother
tongue tool (disaggregated for gender and for the vulnerable)
 Increase of students with at least 60% scores in the relevant Early Grade Reading Assessment
mother tongue tool (disaggregated for gender and for the vulnerable)
71.
The government has recorded significant achievements in expanding access to basic education;
however, many children, particularly the poor and disabled, remain out of school, while overall quality
of education is low. Gender disparity remains in education enrolment, with boys continuing to lag
behind girls. The challenge of poor educational access and low student learning is far worse for certain
subgroups, including the poor, the disabled and indigenous peoples (IPs). The WBG will continue to
support the government’s reform agenda in basic education, aiming for the improvement of early grade
reading and math skills of students, which are prerequisites for progression and learning in the higher
levels. Bank operations will focus on regions with high poverty incidence. The Bank will also contribute
to improving access and quality outcomes in basic education for disadvantaged groups (out of school
youth, IPs youth and persons with disabilities). Bank support for this outcome area is provided through
integrated AAA, the Learning, Equity and Accountability project and NCDDP.

25

Outcome 2.4 A Strengthened Social Protection System
Development Constraints: Poverty and vulnerability increase risk of destitution and loss of human
capital and undermine quality of life
Strategic Outcomes: A Strengthened Social Protection System
Indicators:
 Share of poor households registered in the Listahanan database receiving the benefits of social
programs
 Percentage of poor households with children covered by conditional cash transfers
72.
The government has undertaken significant steps to provide assistance to poor and vulnerable
households, combining this with incentives for the recipient households to invest in human capital of its
members. As a first step, in 2009 the government established the national system for targeting public
programs at poor and vulnerable population—Listahanan (formerly the National Household Targeting
System for Poverty Reduction: NHTS‐PR). Between 2009 and 2011, about 11 million households, or over
55% of all households, were surveyed, of which 5.2 million households were identified as poor.
Listahanan was adopted as the database for identifying poor beneficiaries of all major social programs
nationwide. For example, the social pension program and Universal Health Care program use the NHTS‐
PR/Listahanan to identify and target eligible beneficiaries. By the end of 2013, 4 million poor households
with almost 9 million children were receiving conditional cash transfer grants and the bottom 40% of all
people were covered by the health insurance program.
73.
The Bank will continue to support government efforts to build an integrated social protection
system, helping with the expansion, consolidation and implementation of the existing CCT program. The
Bank will continue to support regular updating of the Listahanan data base and use of the database for
other government social programs. WB support for this outcome area is provided through integrated
AAA, and through the SWDRP and the National Community Driven Development Program (NCDDP).
Community‐Driven Development – Key Instrument for Supporting the Vulnerable
Cross‐cutting Indicator: Access to and utilization of roads, education, health centers and water in
targeted municipalities through the NCDDP
74.
There is a long history of CDD in the Philippines, most recently reflected in the Government
KALAHI‐CIDSS program. KALAHI‐CIDSS has been implemented by since 2002 and has financed
investments in basic services in over 6,000 villages (as of 2012). The program has increased per capita
household consumption by about 12% in target areas, and has had a positive effect on year round
accessibility of villages (a 9 percentage point increase in households with year‐round access can be
attributed to project investments), with community members more willing to contribute to
development activities that benefit the community as a result of the project.27
75.
The Bank will support the expansion of CDD approaches as a key component of the
Government’s poverty reduction strategy, targeting 900 of poorest rural municipalities (of which 554 are
Yolanda affected municipalities), reaching out to 24.2 million people (or approximately 25 percent of the
total population) living in poor communities. Bank support will include a number of innovations to
improve outcomes for the poorest areas and households including: (i) allocating resources on a per

capita basis and in accordance with poverty incidence, (ii) improving inclusion of marginalized groups
(and support to vulnerable areas by strengthening diagnostic tools and facilitation skills and encouraging
investments that address disaster risks and/or social conflict; (iii) further strengthening the program’s
gender sensitive design; and (iv) broadening partnership arrangements, particularly with the
Department of the Interior and Local Government, linking CDD to local service delivery to help make
local government planning processes more responsive to their needs. The scale‐up of CDD is directly
aligned with additional efforts on the part of the Government of the Philippines to introduce
participatory budgeting approaches and greater fiscal decentralization at municipal level. Bank support
is provided through integrated AAA and NCDDP.
Engagement Area 3: Rapid, Inclusive and Sustained Economic Growth
76.
The WBG will work together to support a better environment for inclusive economic growth and
job creation in the Philippines. The focus of joint effort will be on strengthening key economic policies,
supporting private sector development, improving the investment climate, increasing access to finance
and strengthening the financial sector. There will also be support for building basic infrastructure and
increasing productivity and access to markets in rural areas, with the development of the agribusiness
sector by focusing on strengthening priority value chains among poor farmers and fishers.
Outcome 3.1 Strengthening Economic Policy
Development Constraint: Policy distortions undermine inclusive growth
Strategic Outcome: Strengthening Economic Policy
Indicators:
 Public investment ratio to GDP increase to 5% (from 2.5%)
 1‐2 Urban corridors with ongoing/completed improvement of public transit services (to be added at
time of the CPS Progress report)
 Increase in public spending to lagging regions (to be added at time of the CPS Progress report)
77.
The WBG will work with the government to refine and implement the overall economic policy
agenda for more inclusive growth. The WBG will lead analysis of the key issues raised in the PDR 2013:
Creating More and Better Jobs, supporting in‐depth analyses of selected sectors and formulating
corresponding reform implementation plans. The key sectors include transportation and shipping (joint
IBRD‐IFC policy analysis), energy, agriculture (rice policy and land reform), urban development (land
management and governance) and, more broadly, competition policy. WBG support for this outcome
area is provided through integrated AAA, the annual series of DPOs, the National Road Infrastructure
and Management Project‐2 (NRIMP‐2), Regional Infrastructure for Growth project (RIGP), and potential
new lending operations supporting transport in Manila and Cebu City, and the Philippines Rural
Development Program (PRDP).
78.
Public infrastructure gaps are widely recognized as binding constraints to job creation, inclusive
growth and equitable social development in the Philippines. Enhancing both the quality and quantity of
spending remains a priority challenge. Public infrastructure spending remains at less than 2.5% of GDP
per annum, an amount that government has vowed to double in the medium term. The WBG will assist
the government in expanding and upgrading the quality of transport infrastructure, supporting capacity
development (institutionalizing inter‐agency coordination, business process improvements, and integrity
strengthening activities to improve governance in the sector progressively) and supporting the
introduction of innovative and international good practices in developing and managing transport
infrastructure. The Bank will support the Government in implementing a digital and publicly accessible
master road network that covers both national and sub‐national (including provincial, city‐municipal,
27

and barangay) road responsibilities. The IFC and the WB will work together in analyzing logistics issues
and recommending areas for improvement and reform. The WBG will also continue to provide support
for the government’s ambitious PPP program. The WBG, in collaboration with other development
partners, will support improvements in the quality of transport services in Metro Manila and Cebu City
(serving as templates for approaches in other cities), and will provide infrastructure support to the
overall urban sector strategy (including to enhance inter‐ and intra‐ city connectivity to reduce the cost
of trade and logistics and to improve the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry).
79.
The WBG will support complex market reform and restructuring issues in the energy sector,
providing continued support to the diverse array of agencies responsible for energy policy, regulation,
market operation, asset management, rural electrification and oil and gas, recognizing that the energy
agencies are, for the most part, increasingly capable and sophisticated. The WBG will also support
government efforts to attract investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities and gas‐fired power
plants, with an emphasis on public‐private partnership approaches, and a focus on Mindanao (where
electrification rates are lowest, new power generation capacity is most needed, and private sector
capital is relatively harder to attract).
80.
The Bank will also analyze the type of economic and public expenditure policies most suitable
for sustaining and deepening inclusive growth in the leading regions, and helping lagging regions and
communities/groups to converge with the best performers. Attention will be given to the appropriate
policy mix between policies focused on infrastructure investments and those that invest in “portable
human capital endowments” necessary to obtain the best outcomes in terms of reducing inequalities
between and within regions and communities.
Outcome 3.2 Improved Investment Climate, including Greater Access to Finance
Development Constraints: Lack of access to finance and poor business environment constrains
investment, limits firm growth and competitiveness and exacerbates inequality
Strategic Outcomes: Improved Investment Climate, including Greater Access to Finance
Indicators:
 Number of days to start a business
 Number of enquiries received by the credit information system (and value of financing)
 Number of MSMEs that are granted credits secured with movable property (and value of financing)
 Share of population in lower 40% of income distribution with access to formal financial services
81.
As outlined in the PDR on Jobs, improvements in the business climate and access to finance are
critical for job creation and poverty reduction. Simplifying rules and regulations in business registration
and licensing, entry and exit, paying taxes, and access to finance are needed to encourage rapid growth
of businesses of all sizes and encourage movement of small firms to the formal sector and in the process
increase their productivity and market access. Priority should be given to addressing the top three
concerns in the Doing Business Report: i) starting, operating, and closing a business, ii) paying taxes, and
iii) accessing finance; with particular attention to the needs of small and medium‐sized businesses. WBG
support for this outcome area is provided through integrated AAA, the annual series of DPOs, and IFC
investments.
82.
WBG will continue to provide a comprehensive solution for financial sector policy reform and
implementation, focusing on upstream policy reforms and institution building, and providing direct
targeted assistance and investments to support private and financial sector development. The WBG will
support a range of policy reforms in financial sector regulation and supervision, and institution building
for supervisory agencies through a combination of analytical work, technical assistance and lending. The
28

IFC will support these upstream activities with targeted technical assistance, especially in the areas
where private sector engagement is crucial, and the provision of direct investments to private financial
institutions and support these financial institutions’ capacity to increase lending to priority sectors such
as MSMEs, which are critical to job creation. In the area of private sector development, the WBG will
work on broader policy reforms and provide technical assistance implementing investment climate
reforms that will improve the competitiveness of prioritized sectors, such as Agribusiness and
Shipping/Logistics, and work on the credit information bureau and secured transactions registry.
Outcome 3.3 Increased Economic Growth, Productivity and Employment in Rural Areas
Development Constraint: Low productivity and sub‐optimal integration into markets lowers economic
opportunities and quality of life in rural areas and increases the cost of living
Strategic Outcome: 3.4 Increased Economic Growth, Productivity and Employment in Rural Areas
Indicators:
 Increase in real household incomes (on, off and non‐farm) of farmer and fisher beneficiaries
 Access to financial services by agri firms (including targets for women)
 Public and private sector investments in agriculture and agribusiness sector in program areas
(Bangsamoro)
83.
The development of the rural sector is a crucial first step for the country to provide more and
better jobs for the poor. Three quarters of the poor are found in rural areas, and agriculture employs
most of the poor. This means that agriculture can play a key role in efficiently reducing poverty. In turn,
productivity improvements in agriculture can help the country expand its manufacturing sector through
lower minimum wages (as transmitted by lower food prices) and input costs. Investment and
productivity can be improved by securing long‐term individual property rights. Farm productivity and
household income can be enhanced by increasing investment in agricultural public goods and support
services instead of subsidizing farm inputs. Market Liberalization initiatives can be pursued in the area of
marketing and logistics to further reduce food and input prices, and encourage more economic activity
and job creation. Clusters and value‐chain development approach can be used in delivering public goods
and support services to connect smallholders and agribusiness.
84.
The WBG will support improving agricultural and fisheries productivity as well as the
modernization of the agri‐food value chains, as these are critical for developing the rural areas,
providing increased opportunities for employment, and improving sector competitiveness. WBG support
will be focused on formal and informal farmer/fisherfolk groups/cooperatives and on enhancing priority
value chains identified and prioritized by the Government. The Bank Group will assist in improving
Government’s capacity to deliver public services and infrastructure which are critical for improving
access to appropriate technology, finance, information and markets in the rural areas. The focus will be
on areas with significant production potential and the rural poor producers therein, and in the process,
involve the vulnerable and landless communities in both farm and non‐farm income and job
opportunities. The Bank will support improved connectivity for regional development in rural areas,
focusing on the areas for tourism, agricultural production, and logistics, which are crucial for rural
growth, jobs creation and poverty reduction. The WBG will support the integration of national and local
road networks, including farm‐to‐market roads.
85.
The WBG will also support the development and implementation of a key institutional and
policy reforms, those that are necessary for promoting inclusive growth, including (but not limited to):
the country’s food security policy; development of a rational and effective targeting framework for
agriculture and rural development programs; implications and opportunities for the country's
agriculture and fisheries in the Asian Free Trade Agreement, and land reform issues. The WBG will also
29

promote investments and partnerships for agribusiness development, through support to: (a) public
infrastructure and support services, (b) banks to improve access to rural financial service products for
producers and agribusiness firms, and (c) an improved policy, institutional and regulatory environment
for the promotion of agri‐fishery enterprises and private sector delivery of services and agribusiness
investments.
86.
WBG support will be provided through integrated AAA, the annual series of DPOs, existing
projects (Mindanao Rural Development Project 2 and the Participatory Irrigation Development Project
(PIDP), proposed lending (PRDP, Gearing Rural Organizations for Wealth Creation), and IFC investments.

87.
The Philippines is exposed to a wide range of natural hazards, is among the top global disaster
hotspots, and is one of the most vulnerable countries to global climate change.28 While the Philippines is
currently a minor contributor to global warming, its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are expected to
rise significantly over the next 20 years. Despite a strong reform agenda and substantial progress made
by the government over the past couple of years on both climate change adaptation and mitigation, and
disaster risk reduction and management, challenges remain in completing the reforms and moving to
larger scale implementation of policies and instruments.
88.
The WBG will continue to support the government in implementing climate change action,
disaster risk reduction and environment management. The WBG will emphasize the linkage between
environmental sustainability, low carbon development, disaster risk reduction and climate change
adaptation to the overall sustainable development agenda. The Bank will support the implementation of
government climate change reforms to ensure that the enabling environment is firmly in place at
national, sector and local levels and that the planning, design and implementation of key climate
projects, activities and programs is effective, while providing and sustaining solid levels of financing,
focusing on both national and local levels.
89.
The Bank will help improve the multi‐hazard resilience of critical public assets, the resilience of
LGUs, disaster risk financing and insurance, strengthening the legal and institutional framework for

disaster risk management and recovery, mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction and climate actions at
national and sector levels, mobilization of climate budget for a more effective utilization of climate
finance at local and national levels to support a transition to low carbon and climate resilient
technologies, and the development of tools to integrate vulnerability reduction into local planning and
prioritization processes. In this context, the Bank will help design and execute disaster risk insurance and
capital market instruments to help the Philippines manage the risk of natural disasters and transfer the
residual risk to the private sector.
90.
The Bank will support more effective and sustainable resource management, including systems
of community‐based management of natural resources and natural capital accounting. The Bank will
continue to support the Philippines in its efforts to reduce environmental pollution from gaseous, liquid
and municipal wastes and persistent organic pollutants. The WBG will also continue to support
government efforts to manage incremental emissions from the power sector. The Bank program will
focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and natural gas. The Bank will also continue to support
natural capital accounting,29 which will support the operationalization of the Philippine medium‐term
plan in terms of developing indicators on sustainable and inclusive growth; analyzing management
options for decision‐making on vital issues (such as resource conflicts, climate change, and policy
reforms); and the institutionalization of the natural resources accounting based on internationally
accepted standards. The IFC will continue to help financial institutions finance energy efficiency projects
that aim to reduce energy consumption for the same level of production or services, or increase
productivity and create more products/services output with the same level of energy consumption. The
IFC will also support the development of green building regulations at the national and sub‐national
levels to set higher and mandatory standards for new building construction and operation. The IFC will
also use climate investment funds to accelerate development of new renewable energy projects by the
private sector. MIGA will partner with the World Bank and IFC where possible.
91.
The WBG will also continue to support efforts to manage water resources effectively. The WBG
will support efforts to address institutional fragmentation and promote good water governance at a
river basin level. The Bank will work with government and other development partners to implement a
program for sustainable flood management in the Metro Manila area. The Bank will also support piloting
of best practices for secure social housing with the potential for further scale up, for Metro Manila and
for areas affected by natural disasters.
92.
WBG support to this engagement area is provided through integrated AAA, the IFC Green
Building Regulations, existing lending (the Catastrophe ‐ Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO), the
Laguna de Bay Institutional Strengthening and Community Participation project (LISCOP), Regional
Infrastructure for Growth, Metro Manila Wastewater Management project, PIDP) and
proposed/indicative lending (Philippine Renewal Energy Development project (PhRED), annual
programmatic DPO, PRDP, Metro Manila and Cebu City bus rapid transit projects, and indicative flood
management and shelter projects.)
Engagement Area 5 ‐ Peace, Institution Building, and Social and Economic Opportunity
Development Constraint: Low social cohesion and Development Constraint: High rates of poverty,
high levels of violence in parts of Mindanao
inequality and injustice in conflict‐affected areas
Strategic Outcome: 5.1 Increased trust within
communities, and between citizens and the state
in conflict areas
29

Strategic Outcome: 5.2 Development and
implementation of a “Peace Dividend” program
for the Bangsamoro

Financed under the Global Partnership on Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES).

31

Indicator:
 Number of community members reporting trust
in other members/groups within their
community in project areas (survey‐based)
 Number of new Government institutions
established for the Bangsamoro

Indicators:
 Total number of people benefiting from
improved access to basic services in conflict‐
affected areas (total and female beneficiaries)
 % of trainees in livelihood program that secure
wage employment or start new small enterprises

93.
The conflict‐affected ARMM is the poorest region in the country, with poverty incidence at
52.9% compared to 27.9% nationally. All of the ten poorest provinces in the country are either conflict‐
affected or vulnerable to conflict. Poor education and limited economic opportunity lead to widespread
unemployment, leaving young men in particular vulnerable to recruitment by armed groups.
94.
Mindanao’s susceptibility to violence and the dual nature of its economy make it a significant
development challenge. On one side in Mindanao are the growth centers that exhibit sustained
economic growth due to the presence of relatively good infrastructure, educational and health systems,
a dynamic private sector, and world‐class agribusiness firms. These areas benefit from Mindanao’s
sources of growth, particularly agriculture. On the other side are the economically lagging areas that
suffer from poor infrastructure, inadequate basic services, poor local governance and a weak private
sector. A common denominator among these lagging regions is the presence of armed conflict. The
government’s development strategy for the area acknowledges that social inequality, injustice and weak
governance are the main drivers of violence; and notes that insecurity, limited access to services for the
poor and major infrastructure gaps prevent Mindanao from being able to harness the potential for
growth from agri‐business and natural resources and link the lagging areas with the growth poles.
95.
The WBG approach in Mindanao is based on the 2011 WDR: Conflict, Security and Development,
which concluded that “strengthening legitimate institutions and governance to provide citizen security,
justice and jobs is crucial to break cycles of violence.” The WBG recognizes the window of opportunity
afforded by recent progress with the peace process. The WBG will use its convening power to help bring
together the Government, the MILF, other local stakeholders and the development community to
accelerate the development and implementation of a “peace dividend” program for the Bangsamoro to
provide economic and social services to the population, including ex‐combatants, in a timely and
effective manner. The WBG will focus on restoring confidence by delivering results on the ground
through proven effective and inclusive development programs. Intensive support will be provided to
help implementation of the March 2014 Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro between the
Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, focusing on the long‐term process of building
legitimate institutions for citizen security, justice and jobs.
96.
WBG support to the engagement area is provided through integrated AAA, IFC investments,
existing lending (Mindanao Trust Fund (Reconstruction and Development Project, Operational Support
for Sajahatra Bangsamoro, and Program for Local Economic Development Through Enhanced
Governance and Grassroots Empowerment), SWDRP, NRIMP2, Community‐Driven Enterprise
Development (under the Japan Social Development Fund), and proposed lending (PRDP, a new program
for CDD in Bangsamoro, PhRED and the joint IFC‐IBRD Agribuisiness program in Bangsamoro).
Additional support may also be considered in the context of the “peace dividend” program for the
Bangsamoro.
E. Program Implementation and Management
97.
Non‐Lending Activities. Consistent with the Bank’s role as a trusted partner of the government
for policy advice and for access to global knowledge and solutions, and as highlighted above in each
engagement area, dialogue, technical assistance and analytic work will be the centerpiece of the WBG
32

program, with an explicit focus on global knowledge and the deeper understanding of the domestic
context. The Bank will use an integrated program of programmatic AAA for each of the main areas of
engagement, drawing from both international experience and a deeper understanding of the local
context and political economy to refine the understanding of the development challenges in the
Philippines and to help design innovative solutions. Attachment 1 provides a description of indicative
programmatic and thematic AAA and advisory program.
98.
Choice of IBRD Financing Instrument. Consistent with the overall WBG role as a trusted partner,
the majority of new IBRD financing will be for development policy operations (DPO) and Program‐for‐
Results financing. DPOs will be based on the growing stock of analytic work, starting with the menu of
policy recommendations from the PDR 2013: Creating More and Better Jobs, which cuts across all of the
CPS engagement areas. Traditional investment support will only be provided for a limited number (1‐2
per year) of truly innovative, risky, and transformative projects. The IBRD will no longer support single
agency/single sector investment projects, unless as part of an integrated, multi‐sectoral program.
99.
IBRD Lending. The Philippines indicative lending program for FY15‐FY18 is expected to fall within
the range of $600 million to $1 billion per year, averaging out at about $800 million per year (total of
$3.2 billion indicative lending, of which about $1.2 billion may be for DPL operations.) The lending
amounts may vary year‐to‐year. An indicative lending program for FY15 and FY16 as currently
envisioned (possibly $500 million in investment lending and $300 million in DPLs in FY15, and total
lending of $800 million in FY16) is consistent with the exposure management framework of IBRD. The
actual volume of IBRD lending for FY17‐FY18 will depend on how program performance evolves in the
course of the CPS period, continued government interest in IBRD financing, and on IBRD’s lending
capacity and demand from other borrowers. Based upon these considerations, indicative IBRD
allocations will be outlined during annual programming exercises with the Government. The indicative
program will be reviewed twice a year with the government to ensure that all projects: (i) are directly
included in the government’s own Public Investment Plan and clearly aligned with the government’s
development vision (the PDP and the cluster roadmaps); and (ii) clearly meet the criteria for selectivity
of WBG interventions outlined above, under one or more of the five engagement areas. The Bank will
also work with the Philippines at both the sovereign and sub‐sovereign levels, to help the Government
take full advantage of the flexibility of IBRD loan terms to reduce financial risks on their balance sheets,
in particular fixing interest rates and conversions of loans to peso to manage interest rate and currency

Output‐Based Aid (OBA). The Bank will continue to use OBA to reinforce the focus on
development results in the Philippines. OBA links payment to the achievement of clearly specified
outputs that directly support improved access to basic services. The OBA portfolio in the Philippines
focuses on poorer beneficiaries in the water, health and energy sectors.

101.
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS). At the request of the government, the WBG is preparing
a program of RAS to complement existing non‐lending activities. These services would be a structured
program of just‐in‐time advisory activities in support of such areas as treasury modernization and the
development of transport services and transport sub‐sector logistics. The use of the RAS will expand the
option of instruments to be used by the government in their strategy to develop the Government’s
pipeline of investment programs, to anchor the institutional reforms in a long‐term horizon, while
benefitting from experience and best practices across the world. The WBG is well placed to support the
development of RAS in the Philippines, building on large experience from other regions (Middle East and
North Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean) and help interested agencies to combine both
knowledge and know‐how in the planning, design and implementation of new programs.
102.
Trust‐Funded Activities. Trust funds (TFs) will continue to be fully integrated into the Bank
program, with a sharper focus on high priority, strategic areas. As of mid FY14, the trust fund portfolio,
including the AusAID‐financed programmatic umbrella trust fund managed at the country level (see Box
3), comprised 112 grants with total commitments amounting to $152.3 million, about 90% of which are
recipient executed. 70% of the TF portfolio is fully integrated and monitored with the loan portfolio. The
scope will be firmly grounded in the CPS engagement areas, supporting: health, education, social
protection, public financial management, agriculture and rural development, climate change and
disaster risk management, Metro Manila Development, infrastructure, conflict, security and
development (including in Mindanao) and the PPP agenda.
Box 3: Australia‐World Bank Philippines Development Trust Fund
The Australia World Bank Philippines Development Trust Fund was established as a Bank‐
administered programmatic trust fund in June 2009 to help the Philippine Government, the Bank
and Australia plan and collaborate on a medium‐to‐longer term program of financing and technical
assistance that is closely aligned with the strategic priorities of the country. Australia is providing up
to AUD 50 million; the program is expected to close in June 2016. As of end January 2014, Australia's
financial contributions have amounted to AUD 40.6 million ($39.1 million).
The Trust fund serves as an effective platform for leveraging the programs of the two institutions in
support of the government’s reform agenda. The TF responds nimbly and flexibly to government’s
needs as they emerge, as demonstrated by the substantial engagement in priority areas such as
social protection, public financial management, and the scale‐up of the CDD project. The trust fund
has strengthened the partnership between the Bank and Australia at various levels and has
facilitated government’s access to relevant global experience and best practices
In FY14, the TF Steering Committee adopted an enhanced approach to programming allocations
from the trust fund to encourage even stronger strategic collaboration between the Bank and
Australian programs on areas where the country strategies of the two organizations converge, with
funding commitments made based on performance and results/impact.

103.
IBRD Portfolio. The current portfolio is relatively old (average age of 5.6 years) and half of the
projects have been extended for an average of 30 months (19 months if projects with additional
financing are excluded). As such, the portfolio is going through a renewal process as efforts are made to
focus on strategic, larger operations, modernize the project design and disbursement arrangements, and
strengthen the results focus. As of end March 2014, the Bank’s investment portfolio had total
commitments of $3.7 billion, composed of 20 loan‐ or grant‐financed operations. The number of

34

projects has decreased from the peak of 27 in FY08 leading to an increase in average project size from
$53 million in FY08, to $249 million at end March 2014. (Figure 18)
Figure 18: IBRD Portfolio

104.
Key portfolio quality issues include: project start‐up delays, slow disbursement and flow of
funds, number of projects at risk, and weak exit outcomes. Annual portfolio reviews with Government
on the IBRD portfolio focus on measures to: (i) improve disbursement and fund flows, (ii) streamline
disbursement mechanisms, and (iii) strengthen and improve the quality and realism of monitoring
results for new and existing projects. For implementation bottlenecks that relate to the government’s
procedures (start‐up delays, insufficient government budget cover, funds flow within the government,
and delayed procurement), the Bank, together with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), will continue to follow up with government to implement
agreed action plans and find additional measures.

IFC Investments and Advisory Services. IFC engagement maintained a strategic focus on
supporting infrastructure, financial market development, agribusiness, and PPPs, improving access to
finance, and reforming business regulations, with investments increasing by 25% over the CPS period
(outstanding portfolio as of June 30, 2010). The IFC will continue to support the increase of rural
35

investment; promote inclusive urban growth; and improve governance for private sector development.
As of end CY2013, the IFC has a committed investment portfolio of $766.6 million, including participants,
with a majority in infrastructure (58%), followed by financial markets (28%) and manufacturing,
agribusiness and services (14%). The portfolio is composed of loans and guarantees (83%) and equity
investments (17%). The IFC is targeting to commit $250–300 million in investments in the next couple of
years.
106.
MIGA. MIGA currently has no exposure in the Philippines. However, as MIGA now has a
presence in Asia, and has developed new instruments, it is in a stronger position to help implement the
CPS as part of a World Bank Group effort. The primary focus of MIGA's efforts will be in support of
engagement area 3, specifically in support of infrastructure. For PPP transactions, MIGA is able to deploy
its full range of political risk insurance products. To support public financed projects, MIGA will look to
use its credit enhancement products, in support of commercial borrowing by the sovereign, sub‐
sovereign entities or state owned enterprises. Such support can help expand the overall resource
envelope of the WBG, reduce borrowing costs, extend tenors, and diversify funding options.
107.
Gender. In partnership with the Philippine Commission on Women, the National Economic and
Development Authority (NEDA) and the official development assistance‐gender and development
Network, a country gender assessment was completed in 2013 as a key input to the CPS. The WBG will
continue to ensure that gender considerations are mainstreamed into operations, consistent with both
its own and government policies. Development partners are required by the government, by virtue of
the Magna Carta of Women, to report annually on how they mainstream gender into their programs,
and a government report is prepared in conjunction with the Philippines Development Forum, the
country’s main aid coordination vehicle. Since 2009, the Bank has conducted an annual assessment of
the portfolio in the Philippines to determine progress in gender mainstreaming and identify gaps that
would inform project enhancement. The Bank‐financed projects that were classified as gender‐
responsive increased from 41% in 2009 to 75% in 2012, with the balance rated as gender‐sensitive
(2012). The major strengths of the projects in terms of gender and development mainstreaming include
the equal representation of women and men in the design and implementation of key activities,
availability of sex‐disaggregated data and presence of gender focal persons in the project team. Going
forward, the Bank will implement the recommendation that projects enhance their initiatives for more
in‐depth analysis of sex‐disaggregated data and strengthen the link with the broader gender policy of
the government implementing agency. (Annex 8 is a summary of the Philippines Country Gender Action
Plan.)
F. Monitoring Results
108.
The CPS results framework will be the key instrument for monitoring the implementation and
impact of the WBG country program in the Philippines (Attachment 2). The results framework presents
the priority outcomes for the WBG in the Philippines, which are aligned with the objectives of the
government’s PDP 2011‐2016, and the cluster roadmaps. The results framework will mainly monitor
outcomes and indicators at the program level, reflecting the WBG’s increased focus at the program (as
opposed to activity). The milestones and indicators are derived from the project and programmatic AAA
results frameworks to the extent possible and appropriate, reflecting the continued shift of the WBG
program away from financing specific investments and towards the provision of programmatic support.
109.
CPS program implementation and outcomes will be monitored on a regular basis. The WBG
Philippines country team will continue to review and report on progress towards CPS milestones and
indicators on a biannual basis, under the leadership of the Country Management Team. The CPS
monitoring reports will be discussed at least once a year with government, as part of the regular review
of WBG activities in the Philippines. These regular reviews will inform biannual discussions with
36

government on the annual lending and AAA programs, and will feed directly into the internal WBG
business planning process. A CPS Progress Report will be prepared at midterm to take stock of
development over the first half of the CPS period, and to formally evaluate progress and assess
relevance of the CPS outcomes to the CPS goals.
G. Managing Risks
The WBG is addressing a series of critical risks associated with the proposed strategy in the Philippines:
110.
Political Risks. As the country heads towards the next presidential elections in 2016, the
government will need to navigate carefully between concrete results on the ground and steady
implementation of the longer‐term reform agenda. The reform agenda will negatively impact vested
interests, while the benefits of reform may only accrue across the population over a medium‐ to long‐
term period. The Bank will continue to work with the government and other stakeholders to understand
the political economy of reform. The Bank’s technical solutions will be informed and tempered by the
practical realities of reform implementation. The Bank will also work with government to design reforms
that have a higher likelihood of surviving into the next government term. This collaboration can assess
and appropriately strengthen the capacity of the public sector to implement reforms. The Bank will use
the opportunity of the CPS Progress Report (summer 2016) to review and adjust the CPS program and
the lending envelope in light of the overall mandate and development plans of the new Government.
111.
Institutional Risks. The government’s institutional and governance reform objectives are
complex and require a medium‐ to longer‐term implementation horizon. The ambitious nature of the
reform agenda could overwhelm the bureaucracy’s ability to absorb change. Moreover, there are also
risks that the implementing agencies will underestimate implementation risks or short‐term priorities
will detract from institutional transformation. Inter‐agency fragmentation and high transaction costs
associated with coordination may also reduce reform traction. The WBG will place a strong emphasis on
working within partnership arrangements, supporting stronger client participation, “learning by doing,”
and developing lasting capacities within the bureaucracy so that the reforms of the government and the
bank’s program stand the best chance of being sustained beyond 2016. In addition, as part of the
selectivity process, the WBG will continue to assess the extent to which a reform coalition of key
stakeholders is present or can be created before launching major projects, programs or reforms.
112.
Conflict in Mindanao. Despite the encouraging progress on the peace process, many political
challenges remain and the security environment remains volatile. Weak capacity will make
implementation of the Framework Agreement for the Bangsamoro challenging. Expectations will need
to be carefully managed. Programs will need to support the building of legitimate institutions to provide
citizen security, justice and jobs and avoid fueling corruption and entrenching elite capture. As
requested by government, the WBG will continue to accompany this process, providing basic livelihood
and local institution building, but standing ready to provide scaled‐up support as the peace process
unfolds. The WBG will also continue using its convening power to coordinate with the broader
development community to ensure a coordinated response. The Bank will continue to monitor the
situation, and will take appropriate measures to adjust programs, scaling up or scaling down to reflect
both security conditions and emerging opportunities or risks to implementation arrangements and to
the achievement of program/project development goals.
113.
Program Delivery Risks. The Philippines has a track record of lengthy project processing time
and high dropped project cost. While slippage of projects is in part due to the government’s project
approval process, project slippages and dropped costs may also illustrate government’s concern with
the efficiency and effectiveness of its overall expenditure program and some lack of alignment between
sector agency priorities and the administration priorities. The government’s new financing framework
37

envisages that program/project approvals will be separated from decisions on funding sources, with the
latter as a prerogative of the Department of Finance based on the Government’s overall financing plan,
which in turn depends on the Government’s overall fiscal/macro position and the Government’s access
to markets (and the relationship between prevailing market rates versus the cost, terms and benefits of
IBRD borrowing). The Bank will support better alignment of projects and programs with government
priorities. The Bank is also adjusting internal pipeline planning to the new financing framework and the
role of IBRD financing within the overall Government borrowing plan. This is likely to be reflected in an
increase in Bank support to AAA activities, a reduction in project preparation times, but also increased
uncertainty in predicting the lending program going forward.
114.
Reliance on Trust Funds. The overall magnitude of Bank and recipient executed trust funds (in
terms of annual disbursements) in the Philippines has now come to match the size of the internal IBRD
budget. Trust fund resources tend to be less predictable over the medium to long term. The Bank has
fully mainstreamed all decision making relative to the trust fund portfolio into the overall IBRD work
program decision making process. All work program decisions are made with the explicit recognition
that the availability of trust fund resources is uncertain in the medium to long term. Program, project
and activity impact and results are not dependent on medium‐ to long‐term availability of trust fund
resources. The recent introduction of RAS will also help to reduce reliance on trust funds and augment
the amount of AAA that can be funded through internal Bank budget resources.

This series provides an update on key economic and social developments, and
policies over the past months. It also presents findings from recent World Bank
studies on the Philippines, and places them in a longer‐term and global context,
and assesses the implications of these developments and policies on the
outlook for the Philippines. Its coverage ranges from the macro‐economy and
financial markets to indicators of human welfare and development. Its ultimate
aim is to provide advice to policy makers.
This is a multi‐year research agenda to investigate policies that promote
inclusive growth in the Philippines. It includes providing implementation
support, monitoring and impact evaluation to ensure that policy reforms are
sustained. The program also seeks to improve the coverage, quality and
timeliness of data collection and dissemination in order to improve the
empirical basis for evidence‐based policy making.
This supports the development of the financial system of the Philippines
through: (1) the enhancement of the institutional framework for maintaining
financial stability and (2) expansion of access to basic financial services for low
income population and SMEs.
This provides strategic, and often just‐in‐time advice to the Government on
critical issues in the power sector, e.g. power generation development,
Government financial liabilities stemming from the power sector, and cost
management and pricing issues.
This program provides advisory and technical assistance services in order to
assist the Government in helping improve efficiency, inclusiveness and
sustainability in agriculture and agribusiness, with a special focus on raising
productivity and incomes of farmers and fishers, and increasing employment
opportunities in the rural areas. The program will deliver major stand‐alone

productivity and jobs. It will also contribute to enhancing the design of
agricultural modernization, as supported by the Bank programs and projects in
the Philippines. It will provide a range of just‐in‐time and discrete pieces of
AAA, with a particular focus on formal and informal studies, workshops and
other forms of technical assistance.
The programmatic AAA for transport aims to help the government in
developing options and strategies (1) to improve connectivity in the different
regions of the country especially in rural areas, in support of regional
development objectives, and (2) to improve the quality of public transit in
urban areas, especially in Metro Manila. This is in line the country's objective of
investing in infrastructure to strengthen growth in cities and in the countryside,
and increase impact on poverty reduction.
This will support the Government in the launch of priority PPP projects for
competitive tender in the immediate term, development of a robust pipeline of
PPP projects over the longer term, and enhancement of the PPP institutional
framework and the technical capacity of responsible agencies throughout the
process, with a broad range of technical support provided by the Bank.
This project is part of a multi business line programmatic approach to
addressing constraints in the agribusiness sector. The project is designed to
work with a range of financial institutions to improve their capacity and
appetite to lend to farmers and rural SME's. At the same time a number of
partnerships will be established with agribusiness lead firms to support
provision of technical, business and financial literacy training to associated
farmers within their value chain, in effect creating more credit worthy farmers.
The project will promote the growth and development of women‐owned small
and medium enterprises (SMEs) by partnering with financial intermediaries (FI)
to scale up the delivery of financial services and business development support
to women‐owned and managed SMEs. The work with FIs in the Philippines will
be implemented in two phases. The first phase will assist a large commercial
bank, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC), to better serve the needs
of medium‐sized firms. RCBC is a key SME bank in the local market, with
support from its Board to expand its services offering to women beyond the
existing retail products. The second phase will involve working with a thrift or
rural bank to broaden the reach of the program to smaller enterprises.
The project aims to support the efforts of the Government to improve food
security and increase / diversify agri‐food exports by addressing the regulatory
and competition constraints to growth affecting agribusiness. The project will
contribute to inclusive economic growth by 1) clarifying and simplifying
regulatory instruments and requirements that are required for importing and
exporting agribusiness goods and related inputs; 2) improving competition in
the domestic shipping market specifically on regulatory barriers to entry, which
is critical to the efficient movement of goods / cargo; and 3) convening private
sector participation in policy solution design and advocacy in support of the
specific trade and logistics reforms identified.

Development Objective / Description
The project aims to support the Credit Information Corporation in
establishing a credit information system in the Philippines in line with
international best practice standards. The project will include three key
components: (1) determination of the appropriate business model; (2)
development of the road map to establish the credit information system; and
(3) selection of a technical partner to develop the credit bureau system and
provision of advisory services to implement the bureau.
The objective of the Program is to contribute to an improved investment
climate in the Philippines by improving the ability for entrepreneurs and
businesses to register and operate, and targeting sector‐specific activity that
can improve the competitiveness and sustainability of businesses. While there
will be a focus on legal and regulatory reform, the project will also stress the
development of models that support reform replication and increasing the
capacity of local organizations to adopt and lead reform work at project end.
The project aims to improve access to finance to SMEs by improving the
framework for taking non real property as collateral and enforcing creditors’
rights on the same. The project intends to make movable assets (such as SMEs’
receivables and inventory) more acceptable to lenders, especially formal
financial institutions (FIs), as collateral for loans. The project will include three
key components that will be implemented in parallel: (1) improving the legal
and regulatory framework for secured transactions; (2) implementing a
modern, centralized electronic registry for security interests in movable assets;
and (3) enhancing the capacities of local financial institutions in lending based
on movable assets.
The project involves the construction of a 7.15 km, four (4)‐lane elevated
expressway that would extend the existing 2.18 km expressway (from Manila
South Skyway to Sales Avenue fronting NAIA Terminal 3, connecting the other
international and domestic airport terminals of NAIA and further linking to
another north‐south western backbone, as well as connecting it through a
new realignment to the gaming and entertainment complex PACGOR City).
The overall goal of the project is to facilitate the expansion of Clark Special
Economic Zone by providing water and sewerage services for the Main Zone
and the basic infrastructure in the Next Frontier. The project will support an
objective and transparent direct negotiation process with the current private
service provider (CWC) that would lead to the successful signing of a revised
Concession Agreement for Main Zone and the Next Frontier that provides fair
terms for both parties.
Co‐advise the Government alongside the Development Bank of the
Philippines on the structuring and tendering of the design, financing,
construction and operation and maintenance of a light rail extension project
in Metro Manila. The Line 1 project entails an 11 km extension of a 20 km
existing system.

Manila. The team will undertake a three‐phased approach. During Phase I the
team will undertake financial and economic analysis of the different extension
options being considered by the Government. Phase II would entail carrying
out the technical and legal due diligence and structuring the transaction, with
the output of this phase being a Transaction Structure Report (TSR) to be
submitted to the Client. Phase III entails implementing the transaction
through a competitive tender process.
The objective of this project is to assist the Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP), its co‐transaction advisor, and the two project sponsors,
the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), and its
attached agency, the Philippines Port Authority (PPA), to structure and
competitively tender a Public Private Partnership project that will attract
private sector investment and expertise to modernize and introduce
efficiencies in the port's operations.
The objective of this project is to assist the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP),
its co‐transaction advisor, and the project sponsor, the Department of
Agriculture (DA), wishes to implement a PPP to facilitate private sector
investment in infrastructure and logistics to support and improve the
performance of the grains (corn) post ‐harvest supply chain, in order to
improve the competitiveness of the Philippine's agriculture sector, reduce
sector losses, and decrease dependency on imported food.
The overall goal of the Philippines Sustainable Energy Finance Program II ("Phils
SEF II" or the "Project") is to increase access to local sources of financing for
sustainable energy (SE) projects in order to stimulate private sector investment
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The main objective of the Project is to
strengthen capacity of partner Financial Institutions (FIs) in developing and
managing SE portfolio; and assist end‐users, service and technology providers in
implementing SE.

focusing on citizen security, justice, and jobs. The Programmatic AAA will
support a range of just‐in‐time and discrete pieces of AAA, with a particular
focus on supporting an inclusive transition to the creation of the new
Bangsamoro autonomous entity, pursuant to the October 2012 Framework
Agreement on the Bangsamoro between the Government of the Philippines
(GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Through studies,
workshops, analytical work and other forms of advice, the program will also
contribute to enhanced conflict sensitivity of major Bank‐supported programs
in conflict‐affected areas across the Philippines, particularly the CDD portfolio.
The Program will also deliver major stand‐alone analytical pieces on work
related to citizen security, justice and jobs.
This will support the Bangsamoro Transition Commission and other related
transitional institutions with demand‐driven technical assistance on economic
development issues and promote communication and outreach on economic
development issues for a more inclusive transition process. Will share lessons

Annex 1: Mapping for Results in the Philippines
This annex illustrates how the Bank team is using the Mapping for Results (M4R) initiative to map the
portfolio in the Philippines on a micro level.
The annex geographically locates beneficiaries or subprojects financed by the Bank’s operations at the
municipal level, then overlays them with the 2009 poverty incidence.
Projects:
Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (CCT) ‐ the Pantawid Pamilyang provides cash grants to poor
households with school‐age children (0‐14 years old) and/or pregnant women given that they comply
with the education and/or health conditions. The targeting of the households is based on the National
Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS‐PR) database.
The Kapitbisig Laban sa Kahirapan‐Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (KALAHI‐
CIDSS) project aims to empower communities through enhanced participation in barangay governance
and involvement in designing, implementing, and managing development activities that reduce poverty,
as it establishes a strong link between improved local governance and poverty reduction. The project
will be scaled up nation‐wide as the National Community Driven Development Program, supported by a
successor loan just approved in February 2014.
Mindanao Trust Fund (MTF) – The MTF seeks to promote peace and security through community
development projects in conflict affected areas and to build capacity of the Bangsamoro Development
Agency (BDA), a development arm of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Started in 2006, the MTF
has been financing projects that seek to empower communities for them to recover from conflict. This
multi‐donor facility also promotes participatory and effective governance where members of the
community contribute to carrying out projects that will help them improve their conditions.
Mindanao Rural Development Program‐2 (MRDP2) – MDRP2 is the second phase of a long‐term
adaptable program loan on the Mindanao Rural Development Program, which commenced in 2000. The
overall objectives of the project are: 1) to improve incomes and food security in targeted rural
communities within Mindanao, and 2) to institutionalize a decentralized system for agriculture and
fisheries service delivery.

Annex 3: The Republic of the Philippines CAS FY10‐13 Completion Report
Date of CAS (FY10‐FY12): April 2, 2009 (Report No. 479216‐PH)
Date of CAS Progress Report: April 20, 2011 (Report No. 61274‐PH)
Period Covered by the Completion Report: July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2013
This report assesses the effectiveness of the joint World Bank‐IFC Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
FY10‐13, which carried the theme of Making Growth Work for the Poor.
The Country Team rates aggregate progress toward achieving CAS outcomes as satisfactory. After
more than a decade of decline, the Aquino administration has put good governance at the core of the
country’s priorities. Good progress was made toward all major expected CAS outcomes although it was
often slower than anticipated in a context of an ambitious program carried out amid significant reforms.
Macroeconomic stability has been sustained and consistently improved, with highlights including the
recent sin tax reforms. The efficiency and targeting of public expenditures have been strengthened, with
an increase in the resources devoted to priority investments in human and social capital. In basic
education, the CAS period saw good enrolment gains alongside less progress on improving completion
rates. Access to health services increased in terms of health insurance coverage and affordability,
although CAS targets for maternal health and child immunization were missed. In water and sanitation,
there were good gains under WBG projects in priority sectors with less progress towards improved
access at the national level. A social safety net system built on a more accurate poverty targeting
mechanism was put in place over the CAS period, supporting the convergence of social sector programs
going forward. The country has strengthened its natural disaster readiness and response systems and
has taken important steps to build resilience to climate change. Conflict‐sensitive development
programs and scaled‐up provision of basic services in conflict‐affected communities have helped create
the trust necessary to advance the peace process in Mindanao. Progress towards specific CAS outcomes
on good governance include improved public financial management (PFM) at the national level, greater
budget transparency, strengthened anti‐corruption efforts, and substantial policy reforms to promote
better local governance. While not a specific outcome of the CAS program, the overall thrust of the
strategy was to help the Philippines translate economic growth into reduced poverty. However, the
poverty incidence in the Philippines has hardly changed since 2006 despite the country’s relatively high
economic growth.
The Country Team rates World Bank Group performance as good. The design and implementation of
the program has successfully contributed to the achievement of CAS outcomes. Across a large range of
issues the Bank is a trusted source of advice and there has been strong policy uptake of WBG
recommendations. The WBG has strengthened ties with development partners and built partnerships
with key reformers. Through proactive monitoring and a focus on results, the country team has adapted
the program to changing circumstance and priorities. World Bank Group support was strategic, well‐
timed, and flexible through the political transition, and financial resources were deployed quickly to help
manage the impacts of the financial crisis and a series of natural disasters. Going into the new CPS, a
good program of activities and engagements are in place.
IFC’s performance is also rated as good. The program aligned investment and advisory services to
deliver greater reach and development results. IFC engagement focused on supporting infrastructure,
financial market development, public‐private partnerships (PPPs), access to finance, and reforming
business regulations, with investments increasing by 25 percent over the period.31 The IFC program was
well aligned with CAS strategic objectives and IFC’s global strategy. IBRD‐IFC cooperation was strong in
specific areas of engagement (agribusiness, infrastructure, financial sector reforms) as well as in the
overall strategic management of the CAS program.

CAS CONTEXT

The CAS was designed to support the Philippines in addressing a range of persistent development
challenges. Primary among them was creating inclusive growth. As poverty data collected in 2009
underscored, the country’s improved economic performance since 2000 had not translated into
increased employment or reduced poverty levels. As the CAS emphasized, weak governance was a
factor in this and other development challenges. In the 2008 Global Poll conducted by the Bank, the
Philippines was the only country in East Asia where “improving governance” was identified as the most
important way to generate faster growth and also as one of the top two priorities for poverty reduction.
At the time of CAS formulation, the government’s popularity was at a historic low, the political impetus
for anti‐corruption efforts was weak, and there was little credible progress on institutional reform. The
World Bank program was not insulated from the difficult enabling environment, with the Bank’s lending
program falling to a low of $340 million/year over the FY2006‐2009 period, with three‐fourths of the
outstanding $1.2 billion loan commitments undisbursed. Other key development challenges included a
vulnerable fiscal situation, a weak business climate, and underinvestment in key areas, especially
infrastructure and human capital. The Philippines was off‐track on key MDG targets, including basic
education and maternal health. The country, especially the poor, remained highly vulnerable to natural
disasters and sub‐national conflict, and the social protection system was weak and hampered by
inefficient poverty targeting.
Political change occurred early in the CAS period, creating significant space for reforms and improving
the enabling environment for the program. President Aquino III came to office in May 2010 on a
political platform that heavily emphasized good governance, anti‐corruption, and poverty reduction. His
16‐point social contract with Filipinos was subsequently reflected in the 2011‐2016 Philippine
Development Plan through three strategic pillars: (i) attaining high growth that provides productive
employment opportunities, (ii) equalizing access to development opportunities for all Filipinos, and (iii)
implementing effective social safety nets. The World Bank’s CAS, while designed under the previous
administration’s 2004‐2010 development plan, was judged to be well‐aligned with the Aquino
Administration’s priorities with some adjustments in certain areas of the program.32
II.

COUNTRY LEVEL DEVELOPMENT GOALS

The CAS supported country‐level development goals through five strategic objectives: maintaining a
stable macro‐economy, improving the investment climate, better public service delivery, reduced
vulnerabilities, and good governance. This section provides a brief overview of country‐level
performance in these areas.
Macroeconomic stability has been maintained during the CAS period. The Philippines GDP growth has
averaged approximately 6 percent between 2010 and 2012. The country’s 2012 GDP growth rate of 6.6
percent was the highest among the ASEAN‐5 countries, and its 7.8 percent growth rate over the first
quarter of 2013 was the highest among all ASEAN countries. Debt sustainability has improved and public
sector debt ratios have declined. The government has taken steps to more proactively manage fiscal
risks and performance associated with government owned‐ and controlled‐corporations. The
government’s adoption of annual fiscal risk statements has also provided greater transparency on the
source of potential fiscal risks. Fiscal consolidation has continued with increased tax revenue and
improved expenditure management, including the passage of the sin tax law on tobacco and alcohol.
Overall, there were significant increases in revenue collection toward the end of the CAS period, with a
strong contribution from improved tax administration. Total tax revenues grew by 13.2 percent and the
32

tax effort increased from 12.4 to 12.9 percent of GDP attributable to improved tax administration.
International reserves are at high levels and borrowing conditions have improved, thanks to improved
domestic liquidity and sovereign debt rating upgrades. The country earned its first ever investment
grade credit ratings in 2013, from both Fitch and Standard and Poor’s.
Improving the investment climate remains the key challenge. The Philippines has improved its rank in
the Doing Business Report’s overall ease of doing business indicator, going from 148th in 2011 to 108th in
2014. However, the country still trails behind regional peers, including Thailand (18th), Mongolia (76th),
and Vietnam (99th). FDI continues to lag behind other countries in the region. The country has shown
improvement in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index, moving from 71st in 2008‐
2009 to 65th in 2012‐2013. Going into the CAS, infrastructure was recognized as a key constraint to
inclusive growth and to improving the investment climate. Substantial budget increases to key
infrastructure agencies under the Aquino Administration have begun to reverse a trend of historical
underinvestment. While gross capital formation averaged only 18 percent of GDP in 2010 and 2011,
lower than other ASEAN countries, including Vietnam (34 percent), Indonesia (32 percent), and Thailand
(25 percent), it increased to 19.2 percent in 2012.33
While public service delivery has improved, MDG progress remains mixed,34 and there has been no
significant poverty reduction over the CAS period. The country is on track on gender equality in basic
education; reducing infant and child mortality; combating TB, malaria, and major diseases; and access to
safe water. It remains off track on reducing poverty, achieving universal primary education, and
improving child and maternal health. In terms of poverty reduction, the proportion of Filipino families in
extreme poverty has remained unchanged at about 10 percent since 2006. The poverty incidence based
on the national poverty line has also hardly changed, estimated at 27.9 percent during the first semester
of 2012, compared with 2006 and 2009 first semester figures of 28.8 percent and 28.6 percent
respectively.
Progress has been made across a range of vulnerabilities in the Philippines. The building blocks for a
national social safety net system have been put in place, with the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program
conditional cash transfer (CCT) program and the National Household Targeting System for Poverty
Reduction (NHTS‐PR) forming the core of the country’s social protection strategy. The country has also
laid the foundations for mitigating risks from climate change and natural hazards by instituting national
climate change and disaster risk reduction laws and frameworks, and integrating climate change
adaptation and DRRM into national and local development plans. A breakthrough in the peace process
in Mindanao represents progress towards ending a long‐standing conflict that has had a severe impact
on development outcomes and economic growth in Mindanao, where some of the poorest Filipinos live.
Important strides were made in governance. The Administration has demonstrated a strong
commitment to good governance and anticorruption during the CAS period. At the national level, it has
focused on strengthening the performance of government agencies, introduced transparency in budget
preparation and implementation, and has undertaken an extensive PFM reform agenda. It has
demonstrated its commitment to building strong checks‐and‐balances in the new appointments of
reform‐minded top level officials at the Supreme Court, the Office of Ombudsman, and the Commission
on Audit. Also, the enactment of the “GOCC Governance Act of 2011” represents an important
milestone in the country’s effort to make GOCCs not only financially viable but also transparent and
accountable. At the local level, Government has introduced measures to increase the transparency and
accountability of LGUs, as well as performance incentive programs. It has also introduced measures to
institutionalize community participation in local‐level funding decisions through the Bottom Up
Budgeting (BuB) initiative. The government’s strong efforts to tackle corruption appear to be reflected in

recent corruption surveys. The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI)35 ratings for
institutions improved from 3.24/7 in 2009/10 to 3.76/7 in 2013/14. Transparency International’s
Corruption Perception Index (CPI)36 also show improvements: moving from 139th out of 180 countries in
2009 to 94th out of 177 countries in 2013.The Social Weather Station’s 2012 Survey of Enterprises on
Corruption also reported progress on tackling corruption, with over 70 percent of business
representatives surveyed reporting that they “see less corruption now” compared to the previous
administration.37
III.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

This section provides a broad overview of CAS performance under the program’s five strategic
objectives. A detailed review of performance by each CAS outcome is found in Annex 1. Overall, the
program achieved 52 percent of CAS outcomes, partially achieved 43 percent, and did not made
progress towards four percent (one outcome).
Strategic Objective 1: Stable Macro‐Economy – Pillar rating – Highly Satisfactory
The CAS strategy in this area focused on supporting the government to maintain the tax effort, improve
the efficiency of public spending, and improve fiscal risk management. It was strongly complemented by
bottom‐up engagement on good governance and anti‐corruption. A mix of instruments underpinned the
Bank’s engagement in this area, including a rich program of analytic and technical assistance,38 a series
of annual DPLs, and an investment project on tax administration.
The government has maintained the tax effort. Tax revenue has increased in line with government
spending due to improved tax collection, with the level of non‐financial public sector debt falling relative
to GDP during the CAS period. There was a significant increase in revenue collection in the latter parts of
the CAS period. Between 2011 and 2012, total tax revenues grew by 13.2 percent and the tax effort
increased from 12.4 to 12.9 percent of GDP. The passage of the sin tax law on tobacco and alcohol,
despite a lengthy and difficult parliamentary process, represents a significant achievement and progress
toward deeper structural reform. The Bureau of Internal Revenue has also undertaken an ambitious
medium‐term strategic plan for tax administration reform. The World Bank has advised the government
on tax system reform through TA and AAA activities, while tax administration reform has been
supported by a mixture of policy lending and a national program of support for tax administration
reform (NPSTAR).
There has been significant progress on improving the efficiency and targeting of public expenditures.
Forward estimates and paper on budget strategies have been used as inputs for annual budget
formulation. Programs and associated budgets are better aligned to the administration’s priorities, with
increased allocations for key social programs. Budget expenses once presented as lump sum are now
itemized, and the use of a medium‐term expenditure framework and zero‐based budgeting allows for
better allocations. Some line departments have improved budgeting and public expenditure targeting,
while the NHTS‐PR enables more efficient poverty reduction spending. Bank AAA work drew attention to
gaps in public spending on infrastructure, education, and health and helped inform DPL‐supported
reforms involving budgetary reallocations in priority areas.
The government has improved management of fiscal risks. Key prudential regulation requirements
continue to be met, commercial banks’ distressed asset ratios have fallen, and the government has

begun to publish fiscal risk statements. Further progress remains constrained by relatively low levels of
revenues and high levels of debt, weaknesses in the public debt management framework, and
contingent liabilities in GOCCs. Actions under the DPL series have directly addressed these issues and
were informed by discussions notes and studies.
Strategic Objective 2: Improved Investment Climate Pillar Rating ‐ Satisfactory
WBG support to improving the investment climate focused on strengthening the enabling business
environment, supporting investments in infrastructure, and increasing access to financial services.
The government has implemented reforms in key agencies and increased budget allocations, with a
recovery in public spending in 2012 after a slowdown earlier in the CAS period. Public infrastructure
investment initially dropped between 2010 and 2011 as the Aquino administration undertook a review
of public spending and implemented reforms, but has recovered strongly in 2012, reflecting
improvements in line agencies’ budget absorptive capacity, as well as gains from institutional reforms
undertaken in 2011 to improve transparency and cost‐effectiveness of infrastructure spending.
Government disbursements reached 16.8 percent of GDP in 2012, with the highest increases in
infrastructure, where spending increased by 58 percent between 2011 and 2012. DPWH, which
accounts for the bulk of infrastructure commitments, has improved project selection and procurement
management. The WBG has supported a wide range of infrastructure interventions, including dedicated
road and power sector projects, projects to support LGU infrastructure investment by increasing their
access to finance, and community‐driven infrastructure projects. In the power sector, IBRD and IFC have
helped to increase rural access to electricity and strengthen electric cooperatives. IFC also contributed
to critical rehabilitation programs and additional generation capacity through its investments, and
supported improved power access in off‐grid areas by catalyzing private sector participation. IFC
advisory services also helped support private participation in rural electrification.39 PPPs have been a
central component of the government’s strategy to accelerate infrastructure delivery but their
preparation has required more time than anticipated and progress was slower than expected.
There were improvements in terms of business regulatory reforms at the local level, but national level
reforms are still needed to ensure consistency and deeper integration between related agencies. In
2010, uniform and simplified business registration procedures for all LGUs were mandated by national
policy. As of December 2012, 451 out of 480 LGUs have streamlined their procedures. In addition, 372
non‐target LGUs and 78 tourist LGUs (90% out of 87 targeted LGUs) have undergone re‐engineering of
their business permitting and licensing systems (BPLS). IFC has supported business permit and licensing
reforms through technical assistance and has partnered with four Philippine cities to improve their
business registration processes. Savings to the private sector from these partnerships exceeded US$7
million and business registrations increased an average of 24 percent one year after reforms were
implemented in respective cities.
In the rural sector, household incomes, business assets, and agricultural productivity have increased in
project areas. The number of LGUs and public utility providers investing in infrastructure has also
increased through support from the Bank’s Support for Strategic Local Development and Investment
Project (SSLDIP) project. The Bank has supported an improved rural business climate, a greater inflow of
private investments, and a greater focus of public investments on the provision of public and semi‐
public goods. IFC has provided capacity‐building assistance to smallholders in the areas of international
certification, with the aim of enhancing their market access. For example, IFC supported Mindanao
smallholder banana farmers to achieve Rainforest Alliance Certification, resulting in an average 30
percent increase in farmers’ net incomes. The Bank’s extensive, programmatic AAA program also
directly contributed to the agriculture sector strategy in the PDP 2011‐2016, and has set the stage for a
39

68

significant shift away from centrally‐driven modalities. The programmatic AAA program has also helped
develop a new strategic and institutional framework for rural development. Private investment in
agriculture and the rural sectors has been a focus of WBG engagement, including as part of IFC’s work.
These activities have yet to show sustained impact in terms of agricultural labor productivity across the
sector, but they may have contributed to recent increases in gains in commodity yields, notably in paddy
rice and corn. Agricultural labor productivity, measured as Real Agriculture GVA/Employed labor force
in agriculture, remained generally flat during the 2008‐2012 period, surging in 2013 due to a
combination of base effects, real increase in output, and reduction of employed persons in the sector.40
At the same time, paddy rice and corn average yields have posted increases over the 2008‐2013 period,
especially from 2011 to 2013. Irrigated paddy rice posted percentage change in average yields of 5% and
2.4% in 2012 and 2913, while yellow corn posted changes of 5.6% and 7.9 percent in 2011 and 2012. 41
Progress has been made on access to finance, especially for micro and small enterprises. The percent
of total bank lending to the micro‐, small‐, and medium‐enterprise (MSME) sector has increased to some
extent,42 as has the volume and number of new housing loans. However, MSME financing remains at
relatively low levels and there continues to be a lack of access to basic financial services, with limited
credit bureau coverage. Cooperatives and informal financial service providers continue to fill existing
gaps as financing sources to the unbanked. Improving LGU access to financing has been supported by
the SSLDIP project but private financial institutions are still unable to participate in the market.
Strategic Objective 3: Better Public Service Delivery Pillar Rating – Moderately Unsatisfactory
The third CAS objective focused on improving the quality and accessibility of public services in
education, health, and water and sanitation, with a special focus on poorer areas. CDD programs were
scaled up during the CAS period and were a major instrument for improving access to basic services.
Education outcomes during the CAS period were mixed. There were strong gains in terms of primary
school enrolment and good gains at the secondary level. In absolute terms, primary enrolment for 6‐11
year‐olds increased by 686,000 children (6 percent) since 2008, a significant number given that the
majority of these students are enrolled in public schools and belong to the relatively poor. Primary and
secondary level completion rates have dropped below pre‐2008 levels.43 A number of key reforms were
made over the period, including expanded data and resource management systems, the introduction of
national competency‐based teacher standards, and increased provision of financial resources to schools.
The government, with Bank support, also expanded a number of programs to improve primary schooling
access for the poor.44 Activities under the various components of the WB‐financed National Program
Support for Basic Education (NPSBE) and the associated AusAID‐financed Support for Philippine Basic
Education Reforms (SPHERE) project had an important role in basic education reform. Analytic work
informed policy and program responses to address the problems of access, equity, and quality.
Health service access has improved, as has health service delivery for the poor. Enrolment coverage in
the National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) increased according to government data. Immunization
targets for the CAS were partially met and the government’s efforts on this front, which have helped to
lower the under‐5 mortality rate during the period, were supported through the Bank’s sector‐wide
lending project. CAS targets for maternal health were mixed, with some increase in the share of facility
deliveries at the national level. While some of the broader indicators of health service delivery have

However, other methods of calculating completion rates, such as that used by UNESCO and the World Bank, yield higher rates. If rates were
to be measured by the latter formula, the 2010‐2011 completion rate for elementary and secondary levels would be 92.82% and 68.79%,
respectively. The primary completion rate is high compared to other countries.

improved over time, others have not. However, when one goes beyond the averages to look what is
happened to the poorest, we note that in all cases the coverage of interventions among the poorest
improved between 2008 and 2011. Average immunization levels declined from 80% (2008) to 75%
(2011), but among the poorest quintile coverage has continued to increase from 64% (2008) to 69%
(2011). While there has also been a decline in average coverage of skilled antenatal care (at least 4
visits) from 76% (2008) to 71% (2011), this appears to have been driven by declining coverage in the
middle and upper quintiles; the poorest quintile saw antenatal care coverage increase from 56% to 63%.
It is encouraging that skilled birth attendance has increased both on average (from 63% in 2008 to 72%
in 2011), and especially among the poor where it leapt from 26% in 2008 to 42% in 2011.45 Financial
barriers to health services have been addressed primarily through the enrolment of the poorest quintile
of Filipinos under PhilHealth’s Indigent Program, and through the expansion of benefit packages. The
Bank TA and AAA program, with European Commission support, helped the government to implement
its health reform agenda, which was informed by the Bank’s Health Sector Review. Bank technical
assistance also helped to assess the cost of universal health coverage.
According to WHO‐UNICEF, household access to safe drinking water and sanitation services have not
increased significantly at the national level, with coverage remaining at pre‐CAS levels.46 The sector’s
fragmented institutional landscape and the absence of a single national strategy remain key challenges.
WBG engagement has directly contributed to priority sector programs, especially in the Metro Manila
region, where WBG operations have resulted in increased access to sanitation and sewerage coverage. A
GPOBA‐funded project has provided improved sewerage and drinking water to more than 200,000
households. A range of Bank projects contributed to increasing water access for underserved
populations, while TA and AAA focused on improving the sector’s enabling environment.
Basic service provision to poor communities was scaled up through the expansion of CDD programs.
KALAHI‐CIDSS, the nationwide CDD project, has doubled in scope since the start of the CAS period. The
government – with significant WBG technical assistance – is currently preparing to scale up the program
to over 900 municipalities across the country with a focus on integration with the Bottom‐Up Budgeting
initiative, which promotes participatory budgeting at the local government level. The scale‐up is being
undertaken in partnership with ADB, AUSAID, Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) as well as the
Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID). A rigorous impact evaluation has
found that KALAHI‐CIDSS led to better basic service delivery, improved household consumption for the
poor, encouraged community participation rates in project activities, and minimized the risks of elite
capture through anti‐corruption design elements.47
Strategic Objective 4: Reduced Vulnerabilities Pillar Rating ‐ Satisfactory
The National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction is in place and the Pantawid
Pamilyang Pilipino Program conditional cash transfer program has become fully operational. These
45

Estimates were calculated from the original DHS and FHS surveys using the recommended WHO definitions of the indicators (e.g. skilled
antenatal care of at least 4 visits rather than 3, and defining “skilled” according to WHO definition) and, thus, may differ from that reported in
the DHS reports. What is important for our purposes, though, is not the absolute levels, but the trends, making exact indicator definition less
important. Skilled birth attendance and skilled antenatal care would be preferred indicators of health system performance than immunization
coverage since they are facility‐based interventions requiring a range of health system inputs to be in place; immunization is typically delivered
by vertical programs with a narrower range of inputs, often through outreach camps. Finally, it is worth noting that these estimates are
compiled from different surveys, namely the Demographic and Health Survey in 2008 and the Family Health Survey in 2011. However, the way
that they measure the health indicators, and the way that they measure wealth, is consistent and there is, therefore, no a priori reason to
expect bias in the trends. The FHS may have lacked the quality of survey supervision of the DHS, though.
46
According to the WHO‐UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme figures used to track MDGs, the share of households with access to safe drinking
water is 91%, the same level as in 2008. The share of households with access to improved sanitation is 76 percent, also the same as 2008
levels. However, the National Statistics Office‐Annual Poverty Indicator Survey (NSO‐APIS) indicates that there has been improvement in the
proportion of households with access to safe drinking water, increasing from 81.4 percent in 2008 to 88.7 in 2011. The NSO‐APIS indicates that
the proportion of households with access to basic sanitation increased from 88.6 percent in 2008 to 92.5 percent in 2010. Similar progress has
been reported by WDI which reports a figure of 92.4% (2011) for access to safe water. Forsanitation, WDI reports a figure of 74% (2011).

programs form the core of the country’s social protection strategy and are the government’s flagships
for poverty reduction and human capital investment. Over 57 percent of poor households are now
registered in the NHTS‐PR database, up from 9 percent in 2008. The NHTS‐PR is used to select
beneficiaries for four national programs, making it a foundational element for the convergence of
poverty reduction programs. In 2013, 75 percent of households identified as poor were benefiting from
the conditional cash transfer program. All of the poor households (5.2) million are covered by the health
insurance. Furthermore, in 2013, the health insurance coverage was extended to additional 3 million
households from NHTS‐PR data base to ensure that bottom 40 percent of the population has access to
the health insurance coverage. The CCT program has also expanded to become one of the core social
protection programs in the Philippines, covering three million poor households nationwide. Results from
a recent World Bank evaluation are positive in terms of the CCT program impact, indicating improved
use of basic maternal and child health services, and increased school enrolment among beneficiaries.
WBG engagement, in partnership with AusAID, has been comprehensive, encompassing technical
assistance, knowledge‐exchange in the form of study tours, AAA, and an investment loan.
The Philippines has made important progress on disaster risk reduction and climate change
adaptation. Policy frameworks, institutions, and national and local plans to manage the risks of natural
disasters and climate change have been introduced and strengthened over the CAS period. Vulnerable
LGUs are now integrating disaster risk and climate change considerations into local plans and are
allotting larger budgets for related activities. WBG engagement focused on strengthening institutional
capacity, mainstreaming disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into development
planning, and supporting better management of the Government’s fiscal exposure to natural hazard
impacts. The Bank’s $500 million CAT‐DDO combined rapid financing to support the government’s
response to Tropical Storm Sendong alongside longer‐term capacity building activities. The Bank also
supported the formulation of the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP), a vulnerability
assessment tool in the agriculture sector, and the strengthening of the Climate Change Commission. It
also conducted a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review in partnership with government.
The recent experience following Typhoon Haiyan (local name Yolanda) offers an illustration of improved
disaster risk reduction. In November 2013, Yolanda, a category 5 typhoon with winds speeds over 300
km per hour, struck central Philippines, Before Typhoon Yolanda made landfall, a total of 26,675
families/125,604 people were evacuated to 109 evacuation centers in 22 provinces (13 cities and 73
municipalities) in the affected regions. DSWD pre‐positioned PhP 195 million worth of emergency relief
resources consisting of standby funds, family food packs and other relief items. DPWH was able to clear
roads within 4 days after Typhoon Yolanda, which compares favorably with international good practice
in disaster response. With respect to direct impact vis‐à‐vis climate change, the program has also helped
to reduce CO2 emissions (over 200,000t) over the CPS period, but fell short of its target for increasing
the volume of Emission Reduction Purchase Agreements (ERPAs), due to the fact that a number of the
projects that counted as part of the baseline were dropped due to delays or were rejected by the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This reduction in the WBG’s ERPA portfolio could
not be offset by the addition of three new Emission Reduction Purchase Agreements (ERPAs) signed
during the period.
A major breakthrough in peace negotiations with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) occurred
during the CAS period, reflecting the Aquino administration’s efforts to re‐energize peace
negotiations. The Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro, signed in October 2012 is intended to
ultimately lead to a final peace agreement with the MILF. The Bank has been a close and trusted partner
on both sides during the CAS period, facilitating and bridging government and the MILF in the context of
the Mindanao Trust Fund for Reconstruction & Development (MTF‐RDP). The Mindanao Trust Fund
(MTF) Steering Committee was one of the few platforms during the CAS period for the government and
the MILF to come together and discuss immediate development needs and to plan for future
development requirements as the peace negotiations proceeded. As a long‐standing partner of both
parties, the Bank was able to play an important role through the MTF to facilitate discussions on
71

conflict‐sensitive development that matched both government and MILF perspectives. The Fund’s
Community‐Driven Reconstruction sub‐component has provided services to nearly 7,000 IDP families.
Together, the ARMM Social Fund Project and the MTF‐RDP have scaled up basic service and livelihood
support through CDD approaches to over 1,400 conflict‐affected barangays. Both programs also
developed more conflict‐sensitive approaches through the adoption of peace and conflict impacts
assessment tools in their operation manuals. The Bank’s analytic program on conflict and security issues
has been greatly enhanced during the CAS period, supported by a State‐ and Peace‐Building Fund grant
and a Clustered AAA on Conflict/Mindanao. The Bank has also taken a lead role in coordinating
development partner activities, including in relation to post‐framework agreement development needs.
Cross‐Cutting Theme (Strategic Objective 5): Good Governance Pillar Rating – Moderately Satisfactory
Faced with the considerable governance challenges in the Philippines, the CAS has heavily emphasized
strengthening public institutions, with systematic efforts to increase transparency and accountability
at both national and local levels. While good governance goals were modest at the beginning of the CAS
because of the absence of a clear government commitment, the Bank was able to swiftly scale‐up
engagement with the change in administrations. Good governance and anti‐corruption efforts cut across
the breadth of World Bank engagement. In addition to stand‐alone governance interventions, there was
a strong emphasis on integrating governance in all new operations and business processes. The CAS
committed the Bank to ensuring that new projects would be designed to contribute to governance
improvements. In this respect, the CAS more than met its objectives. Four of the new operations
approved/designed during the CAS period were strongly focused on strengthening governance,
including the first two Development Policy Loans which directly support better public financial
management, budget transparency and accountability; and two investment operations: the Learning,
Equity and Accountability Program which strengthens accountability in schools and participatory school
planning processes, and the National Community Driven Development Program, which integrates CDD
into existing local government structures to strengthen downward accountability. Annex 7 provides an
overview of the good governance dimensions of projects approved during the CAS Period.
GAC reforms have taken place in selected national government agencies. 17 out of 22 national
agencies now have independent internal audit units, up from 12 in 2008, while key agencies have
implemented GAC programs. The Bank’s Philippine Governance Advisory Team (PGAT) and PREM team
have provided support for GAC at both the agency and project level, including, among other activities,
the development of the Governance and Anti‐Corruption Action Plan for the CCT program, and technical
assistance on financial accountability to agencies to help strengthen the ability of the Department of
Budget and Management (DBM) to promote PFM reforms.
Procurement and public financial management reforms have been implemented at both the national
and local level. The Procurement Law is more strictly enforced, reflected in improvements in the latest
Country Procurement Assessment Report. Budget execution and predictability have improved due to
timely enactment of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) and the comprehensive release of
appropriations. Reporting on public finances has improved with DBM’s regular on‐line posting of key
documents and information. However, the Philippines overall score on the Open Budget Index (OBI)
slipped to 48% in 2012 from 55% in 2010. The slippage was largely due to delays in the issuance of key
budget documents, which in turn were due to Government efforts to improve the quality of the

According to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), the slippage in ratings was largely due to (a) the late publication of the
Organizational Performance Indicator Framework (OPIF) 2012 Book of Outputs, due to a policy decision to review the implementation of OPIF,
particularly all outcomes, major final outputs and performance indicators to make sure that these are aligned with the Aquino Administration's
development priorities, and that these are, in fact, useful information, and (b) a decline in the quality of the document that has been
considered as the Year‐End Report in prior rounds: the presentations for the annual economic road shows produced by the Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas‐Investor Relations Service (BSP‐IRO). DBM acknowledged that they need to coordinate with the BSP‐IRO in the preparation of these
reports to ensure that they meet international standards for budget reporting and accountability.

2012: public participation in the budget process, for which the Philippines has been rated as having a
MODERATE level of public participation in the budget process, or among the top 17 in the world. Policy‐
based budgeting and the adoption of a PFM Reform Roadmap were important not only for financial
reporting but also for managing and controlling financial transactions. The Bank’s support to the
Government’s PFM reform roadmap was underpinned by consistent engagement – despite the lack of
high‐level government commitment during the previous administration – and nimble responses to
government requests for technical expertise since the change of administrations. The Aquino
Administration is now implementing the roadmap, putting in place a comprehensive PFM system with
strategic advice by the Bank and a large‐scale TA facility by AusAID.
Overall, significant progress was achieved in terms of strengthening the environment for local
governance. While government did not pursue structural changes to the legal framework for
decentralization as envisioned in the CAS program, the government, including DILG, achieved substantial
policy reforms to promote local government transparency and accountability. The government has
furthered its efforts to pursue local public finance reform through the introduction in 2012 of Bottom‐
Up Budgeting (BuB), which facilitates the participation of local communities and CSOs in the
programming of the budgets of national agencies. The Bank has effectively provided demand‐driven,
just‐in‐time TA and advisory services that helped to strengthen the design and implementation of the
government’s local governance agenda.

BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE

i.
Design
The CAS strategy identified key constraints to inclusive growth and aligned with the country’s
development priorities, relying on a mixture of instruments for implementation. The strategy carried
forward the main focal areas of the previous CAS in recognition of a development picture that had not
changed significantly. While the CAS was aligned with the prevailing development plan at the time of
formulation, the country team took into account enabling environment constraints in certain sectors,
putting a central emphasis on knowledge work and improving the performance of on‐going projects to
allow the Bank to be opportunistic and in a stronger position to take advantage of reform windows. In
some sectors, the CAS strategy was built around ongoing projects at the time of CAS preparation, rather
than being formulated to tackle key sector constraints or to guide the preparation of new projects. The
CAS also incorporated a wide range of activities and objectives, raising the question of whether a more
selective focus on core challenges is needed.
The IFC program focused primarily on transaction advisory services to support PPPs and investments
in financial markets, power and logistics, business regulations, and financial services. The IFC program
supported the CAS objectives of improving the investment climate and good governance, and was well‐
aligned with the IFC global strategy of supporting the private sector to increase rural investment,
promoting inclusive urban growth, and improving governance for private sector development. IFC's
engagement in the energy sector spanned investments in power sector reform and power markets;
transaction advisory services; and technical assistance. Efforts to improve the business start‐up
environment focused on working with LGUs to generate compliance cost savings for businesses. In the
financial markets, IFC’s engagement involved strengthening the banking sector through capital support
to key banks, particularly in the post‐financial crisis period, expanding the SME lending services of
commercial banks, and increasing small business lending and the client base of microfinance banks. IFC’s
engagement in PPPs benefited from strong partnership with AusAID through a dedicated trust fund
established and administered by IFC to support the preparation of priority PPP transactions.
AAA was central to the design of the CAS program, with strong policy impacts across a large range of
issues. The WBG delivered an impressive range of knowledge products, technical assistance, and
advisory services that supported reform efforts and were critical to the success of lending engagements.
A robust programmatic AAA agenda under each strategic objective allowed the country team to be
73

flexible in response to government requests. These programmatic AAA programs, spread across a wide
range of sectors and engagement areas, each delivered multiple outputs.49 Philippines Development
Reports and Philippines Quarterly Updates were influential regular products, as were discussion notes
prepared for the incoming administration. The knowledge agenda was also extended through the
creation of Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs), as well as South‐South exchanges.
Given the significance of governance challenges, governance and anti‐corruption approaches were a
cornerstone of the CAS. To this end a number of measures integrated governance in all Bank‐supported
activities. The Philippines Governance Advisory Team (PGAT), established toward the end of the
previous CAS period, supported the CMU and the country team in addressing governance concerns
across the portfolio. The fiduciary team in the country office was also strengthened. The country team
has been innovative in its commitment to addressing governance challenges in the project cycle. It
decided to apply a governance filter (the Pre‐Identification Note, or PIN) to new lending projects at the
front end of the project preparation process to identify governance issues and risks in sectors and
agencies where new projects were envisioned. Furthermore, all new projects were expected to
contribute to enhancing governance in their respective sectoral and operational contexts.
Trust funds have been critical in supporting government capacity building, sector‐specific initiatives,
and cross‐sector collaboration. Commitments have risen steadily over the period as the country team
has proactively supported opportunities from other donors to complement investment operations. Trust
funds have also served as effective vehicles for strengthening country systems, advancing harmonization
initiatives, and promoting good governance.
Strategic partnerships have helped to facilitate and enrich policy dialogue at the country level. A
strong partnership between the Bank and AusAID was supported by a programmatic trust fund that
provides flexible support across various strategic objectives. The European Union, along with AusAID,
has partnered in the health and education sectors, ensuring coordinated support to policy actions. The
Philippines Development Forum (PDF), co‐chaired by the World Bank alongside the government, has
facilitated substantive policy dialogue among various development partners and other stakeholders,
including the private sector.50 The World Bank also chairs a Development Partners Focus Group, which
consists of 13 key active development partners of the Philippines. This group provides an informal
setting to primarily discuss overall aid coordination matters and major developments in the country
which may impact on ODA programs. This group was very active post‐Typhoon Yolanda where
development partners had to coordinate closely on various Government requests for assistance. There
are also several examples of parallel financing or collaboration at the sector/project/AAA level, including
under the Mindanao Multi‐Donor Trust Fund (MTF), the collaborative efforts of ADB, JICA and WB on
the Country Procurement Assessment, and the coordinated co‐financing from Australia, U.S., Spain and
WB in support of the Government's KALAHI‐CIDSS (the nationwide CDD project), among others. The CAS
also placed a strong focus on supporting the consolidation of civil society actors to improve the impact
of transparency and good governance advocacy.51
ii.

Implementation

Commitments rose during the CAS period but new lending has been lower than expected. IBRD
commitments totaled $2.3 billion between FY10‐13, up from US$1.4 billion between FY06‐FY09. The
CAS program originally aimed to deliver new lending between US$700 million – US$1 billion per year,
with the Aquino administration requesting increased levels up to US$1.5 billion per year. The program
delivered within the expected range in FY10, but fell short of target ranges in FY11‐FY13. IFC

The program has provided support to CSOs though the Open Budget Partnership, Road Watch, the Philippine Urban Consortium, and the CSO
Advisory Group, among others
50

74

investments were anticipated be on the order of $250‐$300 million per year but have been lower except
in FY10.52
Portfolio performance has been mixed, with challenges in disbursements and project preparation
time. Most projects are rated as satisfactory or moderately satisfactory but nearly half of the portfolio
has been extended, reflecting implementation delays. Project preparation times and drop costs in the
Philippines continue to be higher than other countries in the region.53 The WBG team has proactively
monitored and managed the portfolio and has taken important steps in troubleshooting project
processing and implementation issues, including undertaking an internal portfolio review that
complemented the government’s ODA Portfolio Review. Select portfolio indicators are provided below.
Innovations in CAS results monitoring underpinned proactive efforts to adjust the program and
respond to Government needs. The CAS Results Framework had a well‐organized mix of quantitative
and qualitative indicators and milestones and was complemented by twice‐yearly results days, allowing
the joint IFC‐IBRD country team to track progress towards outcomes. The framework was updated at the
progress report to reflect changes in the program focus. Result outcomes may have been overly
ambitious in certain areas, while in other places there were disconnects in terms of the pairing of
outcomes, indicators, and milestones. The complexity of the framework also made it somewhat
unwieldy to manage.
The CAS Strategy identified key risks, which were proactively managed:
2010 Elections. The CAS identified three risks related the 2010 elections, notably: political risks,
concerns about continued commitment to reform, and risks concerning implementation of governance
reforms. Each of these related to the risk of policy reversal versus the opportunity to open the political
space for new reforms. These risks did not materialize. As noted in section I above, President Aquino III
came to office in May 2010 on a political platform that heavily emphasized good governance, anti‐
corruption, and poverty reduction. As part of his electoral campaign, President Aquino entered into a 16
point “Social Contract with the Filipino People” based on: transformational leadership (governance,
empowering people, and delivery of health and education services), economy (inclusive growth,
competitiveness and jobs), government service, gender equality, peace and order, and the environment.
The World Bank’s CAS, while designed under the previous administration’s 2004‐2010 development
plan, was well‐aligned with the Aquino Administration’s priorities. The government has made
considerable progress implementing the Social Contract with the reallocation of resources to reform
programs in health, education and social protection and more transparency in budget preparation and
implementation, including engagement with civil society organizations (CSOs) and publication of
national government data on a website to promote efficiency and transparency. In addition, a highly‐
controversial Reproductive Health Law and the “Sin Tax” Law were signed into law in December 2012.
Conflict in Mindanao. The CAS noted the ongoing risk that development gains may be eroded by spikes
in violent conflict despite a ceasefire in Mindanao. This risk did not materialize as the Government
showed steady commitment to the peace process and to the provision of basic services and livelihood
support as one of the key building blocks for peace. While the conflict has not yet been fully resolved,
there has been steady progress in the peace process throughout the CAS period. The Bank provided
consistent and growing support to the peace process, leading donor coordination efforts, and helping to
Build institutions, trust between groups, and to support economic and social development, throughout
the CAS period. In October 2012, the government signed a Framework Agreement with the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF). The Agreement lays out a process to establish "the Bangsamoro", a new
52

US$266 million (US$70 million mobilized) in FY10; US$166 million in FY11, US$113 million (including US$17 million mobilized) in FY12; and
US$24 million in FY13 (as of January 3, 2013).
53
From FY09 to FY12, the Philippines posted an average project preparation time of 16.7 months, higher than the EAP average of 15.8 months
and the Bank‐wide average of 12.5 months. The average cost of dropped projects of $156,000 is also higher compared to the EAP average of
$126,000 but slightly lower than Bank‐wide average of $168,000.

75

autonomous political entity to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and finalize a peace
agreement with the MILF. Key technical annexes to the framework agreement were completed in
January 2014, paving the way for the signing on March 27 of the Comprehensive Agreement on the
Bangsamoro.
Vulnerability to the external environment, external shocks and changes in investor sentiment. This risk
was well managed by the Government, with some support from the Bank and broader development
community. The Government put in place strong macroeconomic fundamentals, low and stable
inflation, falling debt ratios, healthy current account surpluses, high international reserves, and a stable
banking sector. The country now has a strong export sector, a more liberal investment regime, growing
transportation and communication infrastructure, and globally competitive entrepreneurial and
managerial talents. While performance has historically lagged behind its neighbors, it is now considered
a high performer in the region. As a result, the Philippine credit rating was raised to investment grade by
Fitch in March, Standard & Poor in May 2013, and Moody’s in October 2013. The Bank has supported
these objectives through ongoing Bank technical support and support to key policy reforms under the
DPO series. Extra emphasis on social safety nets during the financial crisis provided a form of crisis
response that fed into longer‐term engagement of the country’s social protection system. Additionally,
the IFC’s Bank Recapitalization Fund supported investments that helped to ensure the stability of the
banking system during the downturn.54
Risks posed by weak implementation capacity at the LGUs. This risk did continue through the CAS period,
but has been managed and mitigated by the Government with WB support. As laid out in the CAS, the
Bank worked to mitigate this risk through supporting measures for enhanced transparency and
participation, including: the establishment of the seal of good housekeeping, the full disclosure policy,
the establishment of grass roots participatory budgeting, and by its own efforts publish key budget
information through the Government Open data portal. Improved delivery of basic services is also being
pursued through the national scale‐up of the community driven development approach, which works to
build the capacity of communities and local governments to choose, design and deliver services based
on community needs, in a transparent and participatory manner.
Impediments to implementing disaster risk management mechanisms. While the Philippines remains
vulnerable to frequent and devastating natural disasters, this risk has not materialized but the
Government has made important progress on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation,
with consistent Bank support throughout the CAS period (see Section III, Strategic Objective 4: Reduced
Vulnerabilities). The Bank also was proactive in response to natural disasters, taking a key leadership
role in the post‐disaster needs assessment and responses after Tropical Storm Ondoy, Typhoon Pepeng,
and Typhoon Haiyan, and through CAT‐DDO financing after Tropical Storm Sendong.
Implementation risk. The PGAT and the PIN review helped the CMU and project teams develop a
stronger understanding of the political economy dimensions of proposed projects, think through
governance and corruption risks, and incorporate risk mitigation measures into project operations. The
CAS design and its implementation also took into account enabling environment constraints in defining
the modes of engagement in many sectors.
V.

KEY LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS55

Progress under the CAS has been steady in most areas but often slower than anticipated. However,
the enabling environment for WBG engagement has been transformed, benefitting from strong

76

government leadership and the capacities, programs, and reforms put in place during the CAS period.
The Aquino administration has signaled that it wants to bring more coherence, focus, and cross‐sectoral
integration into its flagship programs, with a view to making progress on good governance irreversible.
The Bank’s approach should similarly consider reflecting this emphasis by also building in more
coherence and cross‐sectoral linkages to its operations, while ensuring that strong policy analysis and
implementation support is provided during the next three years. The Philippines has developed crucial
assets (NHTS‐PR) and expanded key programs (NHIP, CCT program, KALAHI‐CIDSS, Basic Education
Sector Reform Agenda) over the CAS period and the Bank can play a crucial role in supporting the
convergence of these programs for enhanced development impact.
Ensuring sustainable improvements in governance requires assisting reform champions in initiating
deeper institutional and structural reforms that maximize the chances of sustaining the current
improvements in good governance. The government’s flagship programs, such as Pantawid Pamilyang
Pilipino Program, the forthcoming national CDD program, and Bottom‐Up Budgeting, attempt to break
the nexus of local patronage politics, replacing them with more transparent and accountable public
service delivery. The Bank should assist the government in designing and monitoring the impact of these
programs with a clear sense of urgency and focus, as the government moves into the second half of its
mandate. It is also important to help build a broad base of constituents inside and outside the
government who demand a continuation of reforms beyond the end of the current administration in
2016. At the same time, support for longer‐term institutional reforms should be balanced with focused
interventions to enhance the government’s ability to deliver results in the short run, including through
continued support to implementing core PFM reforms and selective support to improve delivery
capacity at the sector level.
Sector governance issues need to be addressed further upstream through systematic analytical work
in the WBG program. It is essential to invest more systematically in understanding the political and
institutional contexts in which the Bank’s sector programs operate. Sector engagement notes and
periodic institutional and governance reviews for key sectors may be the right venues for addressing
these issues. With greater investment in understanding governance at the sector level, the PIN review
could better serve its intended purpose of being a lighter process to help task teams consider
governance issues and mitigation measures in the early project design stage.
The centrality of AAA/Advisory services was critical to the WBG’s engagement over the CAS period
and should remain at the heart of the next CPS. A main lesson from the CAS period is that WBG
financing is useful to the extent to which it can consolidate policy reform, provide a source of funds that
can ensure the delivery of important programs, or experiment and generate learning that can inform
better planning and decision‐making. As the country's economy grows and the WBG financing becomes
relatively less significant, the analytical and experimental agenda will become more even more
important.
The WBG may need to be more selective in its engagements to avoid spreading itself too thinly. Given
the resilience of many core development challenges in the Philippines and the relatively small size of the
WBG program compared to the economy and resource constraints, the WBG should focus its efforts on
strategically important interventions and underdeveloped or underfinanced sectors that promise big
development impacts, using pioneering investments, working with partners who share the WBG’s focus
on sustainability, and considering opportunities for the Bank to leverage in greater investments from the
private sector and other development partners. Responding to government requests, the WBG and its
development partners should also continue to improve harmonization of their support and to deepen
linkages between each other’s respective programs.
The CAS results framework was a useful tool for the WBG to monitor progress and has provided good
lessons for the CPS. The framework’s quantitative indicators and detailed milestones helped to gauge
progress and facilitate program management. Improvements could be made in setting more realistic
77

goals in some areas, better linking indicators and milestones to outcomes, and making the framework
more user‐friendly without losing the focus on verifiable results.
Availability of timely, quality data is still a serious constraint to policymaking and the monitoring and
assessment of performance. The Bank can play a role in helping to address low quality poverty data
statistics, strengthening the capacity of the National Statistics Office, and modernizing government
financial management information systems.
Lessons from IEG evaluations of projects exiting the portfolio during the CAS period had a common
focus on project design issues, the importance of strong analytic foundations, and approaches to
institutional reform:
 Project design: Project development objectives should be well articulated, realistic, and amenable to
monitoring and evaluation. Design and implementation arrangements should be based on an
objective assessment of existing institutional capacity of implementing agencies and the likely
improvements that can result from capacity‐building measures in the short to medium term.
Changes to results frameworks should be done earlier rather than later in a proactive manner.
 Analytic foundations: IEG evaluations found that project outcomes are enhanced by both technically
sound pre‐existing and ongoing analytical work and by long‐standing policy dialogue over the areas
of reform to be addressed. Programmatic TA provides an important complement to DPL prior
actions and triggers. Coordination of lending and AA covered by DPLs can provide important
synergies.
 Institutional Reforms: Difficult institutional reform projects require close scrutiny regarding client
commitment and preparedness to mainstream reforms. Success is increased if elements of reform
are under way prior to project approval. In the absence of clear manifestations of reforms in
concerned agencies, the Bank should limit its involvement to helping establish a solid foundation for
reforms through TA support, pilot programs, capacity building, and AAA.

FINANCING

Achieved
There have been improvements in the tax/GDP and non‐financing
sector/GDP indicators, primarily from a growth in revenue
collection. The World Bank has provided significant tax policy
advice to the Philippines through high‐level technical assistance –
advising the GOP on overall reforms of the tax system through
various AAA activities. An outcome of this is the passage of the sin
tax law on tobacco and alcohol, which was approved, but after a
lengthy and difficult parliamentary process.
The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner passed a
good high‐level medium‐term strategic plan for tax administration
reform for the 2011‐2016 period (indicative milestone). There has
been some progress on improving performance and staffing
management that is integral to revenue mobilization efforts, and
on improving national and regional management. The BIR formally
adopted a set of agency‐level key performance indicators (KPIs)
conforming to good international practice. Baseline data for 2011
was produced.
In terms of tax policy reform, the fiscal incentives bill is currently
moving through Congress while the sin tax law was passed into
law in December 2012.
Tax administration work has been supported by projects (NPSTAR
and DPLs) and AAA. In NPSTAR, progress is being made in
increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of taxpayer services to
increase compliance, though not yet in the elaboration of a
taxpayer services strategy. Progress includes the creation of e‐
lounges at BIR offices and the ongoing elaboration of a 2012
compliance audit program to assess BIR performance. The
number of registered taxpayers as a percentage of the labor force
has increased to 48 percent as of 1/2012, up from 44 percent,
exceeding the project’s target. However, many tax administration
reforms supported under the program need a continued push to
yield sustainable improvements in governance and collections.

Programs and associated budgets are increasingly aligned to
Social Compact priorities. Budget items previously presented as
lump sums are increasingly being itemized with an emphasis on
making links to policy priorities across agencies more transparent.
National budgets have been passed on time the past 3 years. A
medium‐term expenditure framework is increasingly used in
preparing the budget and ensuring budget allocations meet
priorities. Donor funded projects are reflected in the budget. The
zero‐based/program evaluation budgeting approach was
implemented by the administration in the preparation of the
2011‐2013 proposed budgets with criteria applied to evaluate
major programs, weed out inappropriate and inefficient ones and
expand the effective and best practice programs. The president’s
priorities have translated into significant funding increases for
certain pro‐poor programs such as the CCT, basic education and
universal health insurance. GOP has implemented transparency
and accountability measures, including a review of all existing
projects and bids in government agencies to increase spending
efficiency.
Strengthened expenditure evaluation capacity in DBM/NEDA is
supported by a Bank IDF. The Discussion Note on public spending,
complemented by the 2011 Public Expenditure Review, drew
attention to gaps separating public spending on infrastructure,
education, and health. The studies helped inform the DPL‐
supported reforms involving budgetary reallocations in priority
areas (e.g. increasing fixed infrastructure investments, spending
levels by DepEd, implementation of partial subsidy scheme in the
health sector) and stressed the need to mobilize public revenues
to achieve inclusive growth objectives.
The NHTS‐PR, supported by WBG lending and AAA, is being used
by multiple national programs and represents a major
contribution to improving the efficiency and targeting of public
expenditures across a range of sectors and objectives. GOP’s
decentralization efforts, also supported by WBG under Pillar 5 of
the CAS, have focused on improved efficiency and targeting of
public expenditures. Budgeting and public expenditure targeting
have also improved in some line ministries. For example, the
Dept. of Education first produced an MTEF last year, while school‐
based management efforts, supported by the Bank, are better
aligning expenditures to priority areas, such as classroom

The GOP published Fiscal Risk Statements in conjunction with the
2011 and 2012 budgets, as the Philippines begins to join the ranks
of best practice countries in terms of comprehensive fiscal risk
assessment and disclosure. Standards & Poor’s, Fitch, and
Moody’s have upgraded their sovereign credit ratings.
Key prudential regulation requirements continue to be met.
Enhanced bank regulation and supervision practices contributed
to the improvement in key financial performance indicators in the
banking sector. The need for a close coordination among the key
financial regulatory agencies for system monitoring and crisis
response is recognized with the establishment of the Financial
Stability Coordination Council.
WBG continues to provide support to ensure that key risks are
managed, particularly those stemming from large contingent
liabilities tied to GOCCs, PPPs, GFIs, and natural disasters. Actions
under the DPL series directly address these issues.
Addressing financial risks from natural disasters is another
contribution of the WBG engagement in this outcome area. The
WBG conducted a risk financing study outlining government
options to reduce the fiscal burden it typically assumes following a
disaster, including the CAT‐DDO, which was eventually taken up
by the government, and disbursed in 2011.

Performance Governance System, with performance targets set
until 2016 and its 4Rs ‐ Right Project, Right Cost, Right Quality,
Right on Time‐ as guiding principles) and extension of the national
network by converting local roads into national has caused some
CAS indicators to be missed due to a shifting baseline. MMURTRIP
contributed to improving operational efficiency and safety of
transport system in Manila with the construction and
improvement of 86 km of major and secondary roads. The travel
speeds of users have increased in other Bank‐supported projects,
including ARCDP2, which supported road construction that
reduced travel times in project areas by 69 percent, surpassing
the project’s target value.
Frameworks for integrated infrastructure investment within the
context of overall urban development were advanced through
Cebu BRT project preparation, supported by the Clean Technology
Fund (CTF), and Metro Manila Green Print work (milestone).
In the power sector, Rural Power Project (RPP) targets were
exceeded for connecting new customers to mini‐grid or
renewable energy technologies (over 29,000 households). The
World Bank and IFC continued to support electric cooperatives
(ECs), which have a crucial role to play in the government’s
household electrification program. 10 of 11 participating ECs in
RPP have achieved satisfactory financial performance (91%),
above the target value. Development Outcome ratings for IFC
power projects have exceeded their targets as well. Private sector
investments in electricity generation and distribution have
increased, supported by IFC investments in four now‐privatized
plants.
The SSLDIP project facilitates LGU access to viable financing to
implement strategic infrastructure investments. An estimated
174,838 households are now benefiting from completed
infrastructure facilities financed by the project.
ARCDP2 has financed community‐based and small‐scale physical
infrastructure that supported agricultural and enterprise activities
– and exceeded indicators for number of subproject supported
(260). Projects all were marked as priority investment and all were
provided with budgets for operation and maintenance.
Levels of budget allocation for DPWH and DOTC have reached
historic highs during the CAS period. The Aquino administration
implemented public infrastructure investment reforms to improve
quality and alignment of infrastructure which led to no change in
public infrastructure spending, at 2.4% of GDP in both 2010 and
2011. To counter this, the GOP undertook a disbursement
acceleration plan, realigning slow‐moving projects to agencies and

The main team lead and M&E staff who were looking after this project are no longer with IFC and thus M&E data is incomplete.

PPP program support has been strong but the program has taken
longer than anticipated to roll‐out. The program has exceeded its
target at the national level59, but not at the LGU level. The WBG’s
TA and advisory work, such as for specific PPP transactions and
overall enabling environment, were crucial in improving project
preparation and transparency in the PPP process and building
internal capacities among development partners. For example,
IFC’s recommendations for the structure and procurement
approach for specific transactions have largely been adopted. IFC
exceeded the targets set out, signing 5 new PPP advisory
mandates with the new administration (NAIA Expressway, LRT1,
LRT2, Grains Central, and Davao Sasa Port) on top of the Clark
60
Water mandate.
The Electric Cooperative System Loss Reduction Project has
supported the use of innovative contractual mechanisms and
partial credit guarantees to promote private investment and
financing. The Bank has provided TA to the Energy Regulatory
Commission (ERC) and has supported dialog in the power sector
with technical assistance on key topics such as supply, prices, and
alternative energy sources. In power sector policy, the first phase
of open grid access is set to be implemented in the Luzon and
Visayas by the end of 2012, opening the market to large
consumers and helping to spur new investments in least‐cost
generation. Feed‐in Tariffs (FIT) have been approved and will
soon be implemented. In terms of institutional capacity, the ERC
continues to develop in a mostly positive direction, and has
emerged as sophisticated and capable regulatory body. With
continued regulatory focus on technical loss reduction as well as
refinements to the electricity market, ERC has made important
contributions to efficiency and cost management in the sector.
The WBG has supported policy developments through various
TA/AAA and through investment lending, including the RPP.
On business processes, the GoP Business Permit and Licensing

Academy reports most LGUs as having implemented reform. IFC
has supported this work through TA on LGU Regulatory
Simplification. From 2009 to 2012 a total of six cities are
implementing regulatory simplification reforms, realizing US$7.1
million in compliance cost saving for the private sector.
With IFC support, the government was also able to develop and
implement a more robust M&E system for BPLS, ensuring that the
reforms would result in more businesses registering with LGUs
and creating more jobs and growth.
On trade, the Bureau of Customs has established a National Single
Window (NSW) that automates permits and license application
and issuance procedures for over 30 non‐customs border
management agencies (supported by WBG TA).
The Land Management Bureau (LMB), under the Department of
Natural Resources and Environment (DENR) through the World
Bank and AUSAID funded LAMP2, has been leading legal and
institutional reform that has resulted in Free Patent amendment
so that first time titles can be issued more easily over both
agricultural and residential lands. The project is also supporting
LGU‐led land registration that has been proven in 79 LGU
partnerships in three provinces.




The outcome targets in terms of household incomes, business
assets, and productivity have all been exceeded through the
MDRP2 and ARCDP2 projects.
Policy reforms advocated in the Bank’s TA for the Updating of the
Department of Agriculture’s (DA) Agriculture and Fisheries
Modernization Plan (AFMP) were mostly adopted. Institutional
and strategic reforms for post‐LAD scenario for the Department of
Agrarian Reform (DAR) on Sustainable Rural Development were
also mostly adopted.
Agribusiness development and the rural sector has been
supported by the satisfactory implementation of PIDP, LAMP2,
ARCDP2, LISCOP, and MRDP2 projects, which have contributed to
improving rural infrastructure and strengthened local level
planning, implementation, and O&M through active partnership
with LGUs and communities.
The SSLDIP project has supported infrastructure investment at the
LGU level.
Cities are getting increased access to viable financing and there

LGUs are the units tracked by GOP’s Local Government Academy. The 421 LGUs with business entry reforms are spread out over nine or more cities.

October 2008. Urban issues are becoming more prominent in the
development agenda supported by WBG analysis. A set of policy
notes, “An Agenda for Urban Competitiveness and Inclusivity,”
was prepared and completed under the auspices of the
Government‐led and Bank‐supported Philippines Urban
Consortium (PUC), and has contributed to the preparation of the
Philippines Development Plan (PDP) and Public Investment
Program (PIP). The inputs from the PUC outputs are reflected in
the urban section of the PDP. The process of developing City

The volume and number of new housing financing loans from IFC‐

lending by GFIs to 2nd to 4th class LGUs has increased, and this
effort has been supported by the SSLDIP lending investment.
However, there has been no participation of private financial
institutions (PFIs) in financing sub‐national projects. Currently,
only GFIs are allowed to be depository for LGUs and reform
efforts on this front have been fiercely objected to by the GFIs.
On the regulatory front, IFC worked with the Supervision and
Inclusive Finance teams of the BSP to improve the bank auditors’
capacity in and understanding of risk‐based lending, so that
auditors will not be too focused on looking for evidence of
collateral to banks’ SME exposures.
IFC also provided risk management advisory to the country’s

lending portfolio, including SME, will be in line with international
best practice on credit and operational risk management.

Primary education enrolment targets for the CAS have been
exceeded, while secondary enrolment rates have shown a slight
increase but are well short of the CAS target. Completion rates for
both primary and secondary levels have actually fallen below the
2008 baselines. Net primary enrolment rate improvements are
attributed to the expansion of programs to improve access of the
poor and disadvantaged to primary schooling, including various
Alternative Delivery Modes and the expansion of the CCT
program. Secondary net enrolment rates have been negatively
impacted by a number of factors, including financial barriers for
poor households, late school‐entry leading to students dropping
out to work, and the fact that the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino
Program CCT program has until only recently covered 6 to 14 year
old children of poor households. Recently, the administration has
quickly responded to the highlighted need to extend the CCT to
households with only children of secondary school age by
introducing the 'extended CCT' ‐ which provides benefits for 15‐17
year old children.
Financial resources to schools have increased over the CAS period
through the School Maintenance and other Operating Expenses
(MOOE) and School‐Based Management Grant. This has allowed
schools to flexibly respond to needs at their level, and at the same
time leverage resources from other potential donors or partners.
Action was taken to address issues of equity by providing
additional resources to poorly resourced schools, partly using the
equity‐based formula for allocating school funds. Policies and
guidelines were issued to expand the implementation of school‐
based management (SBM). Teacher standards were developed
and implemented. Alternative delivery modes were expanded to
address the particular needs of the poor and marginalized.
DepED‐LGU partnerships were forged and expanded, especially in
terms of classroom construction and enhancement of SBM.

Support to the national Basic Education Reform Agenda was
provided through the combination of projects (the NPSBE and
associated AusAID‐financed SPHERE trust fund) and a strong AAA
program. Expansion of PPPs within the reform framework
supported by NPSBE secured additional resources. The NPSBE
provided the impetus to launch system‐wide reforms and sharpen
the Government’s policy framework for coordination of donor
assistance. A strong program of AAA was prepared which
informed policy and program responses to address the problems

CAS targets for enrolment coverage of the National Health
Insurance Program for the total population and for the poorest
quintile were achieved, but only partially achieved for national
immunization (DPT3) coverage and facility‐based deliveries.65
Over‐all, the indicator results point towards an increasing
improvement on access to health services. Financial barriers to
health services are particularly addressed through the enrolment
of the poorest quintile under NHIP. PhilHealth has developed
several means to ensure that the poor are not unnecessarily
burdened and has expanded benefit packages, including policies
to cover catastrophic conditions, as well as policies to ensure
patients are not charged additional fees. The NHTS‐PR, supported
by the Bank, was key in targeting the poor for inclusion under
NHIP.
The DOH budget has increased during the CAS period and
together with PhilHealth has provided increasing benefits that
primarily benefit the poor. Although the enrolment of the poor
into the National Health Insurance Program and their access to
available health facilities had been addressed there still remains a
gap in their utilization of health services. It is not currently known
how much of the poor are currently utilizing health services
Bank work has substantially contributed to the Universal Health
Care agenda. Financing was through the National Program
Support for Health Reform project and the EC‐supported Health
Sector Reform Project. Highlights from non‐lending work included
Bank TA to help cost out universal health coverage. The Sector
Health Review provided a comprehensive assessment and policy
recommendations for reform. An IDF grant to DOH supported the
development of the Universal Health Care M&E framework.
The Second Women’s Health and Safe Motherhood Project has

There were issues with the selection of indicators for this
outcome. Indicator 1 & 2 draw on WHO‐UNCIEF figures used to
track MDGS and do not disaggregate the contribution of different
programs and projects, therefore masking the contributions of
WBG’s engagement.
WBG projects have directly contributed to GoP’s priority sector
programs aimed at increasing access to water and sanitation
services. In Metro Manila, the GPOBA has provided additional
drinking water to about 16,000 poor households. The PPP for
water and sanitation in Metro Manila proved to be a successful
model in increasing coverage and quality of service. WSP’s Small
Water Utility and Financing (SWIF) has assisted 15 small water
utilities in improving water services reaching to about 12,500
households in rural areas and small towns. The Bank’s GFI lending
facility for LGUs and private service providers (SSLDIP) and
community water supply and sanitation projects (i.e. Mindanao
Trust Fund, ARMM Social Fund, KALAHI‐CIDSS, ARCDP2, among
others), continue to contribute to increasing water access for
underserved populace.
TA and AAA have focused on improving the sector’s enabling
environment. The Bank has supporting rationalization of rural

contributing so far to about 8,000 households gaining improved
access to sanitation in rural areas. During the CAS period, DPWH’s
new urban sanitation strategy has also been formulated through
the National Sewerage and Septage Management Program
(NSSMP) TA. The Bank supported the formulation and adoption of
a cost‐sharing policy to subsidize capital cost of sewerage projects

As of December 2013, KALAHI‐CIDSS has financed the completion
of close to 6,000 projects worth US$265 million benefitting over
1.6 million households in more than 8,000 villages in the poorest
municipalities and provinces in the Philippines since 2002. These
projects include local infrastructure such as water systems, school
buildings, day care centers and health stations, as well as roads
and bridges.
The results of the impact evaluation revealed that household
incomes of beneficiaries, as measured by consumption, rose
significantly. On average, per capita consumption increased by
about 12 percent as a result of the project. Access to basic
services has also improved significantly in beneficiary barangays
(villages). Specifically, there was 9‐percentage point increase in
the proportion of households within the beneficiary barangays
with year‐round accessibility than in the non‐beneficiary
barangays. In addition, community members were more willing to
contribute resources to development activities that would benefit
the community and community volunteers. Community
volunteers were empowered to engage elected official through
community village assemblies. Meetings also shifted from being

Convergence of key social development programs in targeted

DSWD has adopted a convergence framework that ensures the
coordination and synergy of its three major poverty reduction
programs (i.e., KALAHI‐CIDSS, CCT program and sustainable
enterprise development), all of which are supported by the Bank.
The convergence initially covered about 200 municipalities in 59
provinces and focused on achieving unity of targeting;
synchronization of community preparation/ mobilization;
improving coordination among different sectoral agencies;
coordinated capability building; and harmonizing M&E systems. In
terms of the Bank’s projects and programs, applying a
coordinated approach in a single province proved elusive for task
teams, given uncertainty of a convener/lead among government
agencies, and fact that there was no mechanism in place to
facilitate the “convergence of sector teams” in one LGU.
Other Bank work during the CAS that encouraged area‐based
approaches and convergence of inter‐agency anti‐poverty
programs included: work to better link health and education
delivery with the CCT program; analytical work on harmonizing
various CDD programs in the Philippines, AAA work on the
coordinating bottom‐up budgeting (which seeks to strengthen the
convergence of national services in communities) with the
forthcoming NCDDP and other Bank projects; financial and
technical support for inter‐institutional coordination in urban
development through the Philippines Urban Consortium.

The NHTS‐PR has completed surveying 10.9 million
households, of which 5.2 million households were identified
as poor via the Proxy Means Test (PMT).
The NHTS‐PR database has been utilized to select
beneficiaries for four national programs: the Pantawid
Pamilyang Pilipino program (Conditional Cash Transfer), the
PhilHealth Indigent Program (PhilHealth), the Social Pension
for Indigent Senior Citizens, and the National Residential
Lighting Program. In addition, the database has been shared
with 16 national government agencies, 134 local government
units, 14 non‐governmental organizations, and 8 donor
agencies including the WB and the legislative branches.
The WBG engagement has been comprehensive
encompassing technical assistance, knowledge‐exchange in
the form of study tours, AAA, and an investment loan
(SWDRP) to support these government initiatives.
Bank financing of the operation with AusAID financing of
Technical Assistance was instrumental in the conception of
the NHTS‐PR and CCT programs as well as operational design
and systems development for implementation.



Since its launch in 2008, the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program
(Pantawid Pamilya) has rapidly expanded and become one of the
core social protection programs in the Philippines. The program
currently covers 3 million poor households nationwide (321,000 in
Set1, 273,000 in Set2, 406,000 in Set3, 1.3 million in Set4, and
726,000 in Set5), which is about 64 percent of the eligible poor
households with children between 0‐14 years old. The program is
fully operational and implementation has significantly improved
over the period. Furthermore, the government has been
undertaking various policy changes in order to further improve
the project implementation.
The World Bank currently supports financing grants for Set 1 and
2 beneficiaries under the existing loan (Social Welfare and
Development Reform Project (SWDRP). Additional Finance will
cover Set 4 beneficiaries. Pantawid Pamilya program targets to
cover 4.2 million households by 2016.
The GFRP DPO and the DPO Supplemental also supported the

The government has supported capacity‐building programs in
integrating DRR and CCA into local plans. At least 11 provinces
have DRRM plans, up from a baseline of two, out of a total
universe of 23. 2,739 LGUs have prepared DRRM plans, and 6,773
have established their own DRRM councils, in line with the
National DRRM act. Flood forecasting and early warning systems
have improved and additional efforts are needed towards a
comprehensive system.
The Bank is supporting integration of DRRM and CCA in a number
of lending operations, including KALAHI‐CIDSS, CCT program, and
the Regional Infrastructure for Growth Project that directly
contribute to the reduction of vulnerability of poor communities.
Climate strategies have been piloted under the Participatory
Irrigation Development Project, NPS‐ENRMP, and LISCOP AF. For
example, LISCOP AF allows local communities to improve/
enhance infrastructure to make them more climate‐resilient as
well as subprojects to protect highly vulnerable lakeshore
communities against flooding.
In terms of investments, the Department of Health (DOH)
completed assessment/audit of 199 hospitals in Metro Manila and
Luzon against the original target of 100. The Department of Public
Works and Highways (DPWH) has retrofitted 8 bridges in Metro
Manila, with the retrofits of the remaining 2 (out of the target of
10) currently under implementation.‐ The Department of Social
Welfare and Development (DSWD) conducted disaster risk
reduction training in 24,026 villages across 1,188 municipalities ,
exceeding the target of 1,000 communities. Three DSWD Field
Offices are covered by a community‐based post‐disaster response
window.
The WBG has also helped the Government to better manage the
Government’s fiscal exposure to natural hazard impacts by
supported a risk finance study outlining options to reduce fiscal
burdens typically assumed by GOP following a disaster. This
included the CAT‐DDO, taken up and disbursed in 2011. Following
the CAT‐DDO, the Bank is now supporting the development of risk
finance strategy, led by a Technical Working Group on Disaster
Risk Finance. The strategy will provide key inputs into the Fiscal
Risk Statement accompanying the national budget plan for 2013.

Post‐Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) (FY10)

The original definition of the vulnerable provinces has been changed by government. The WBG metric referred to 23 LGUs vulnerable to multiple hazards, but the government's index refers to those along the eastern
seaboard which encounter typhoons and flooding every year. For the lower level LGUs, the baseline is essentially 0. However it is difficult to indicate the percentages as the DILG audit does not have a breakdown of these
LGUs.

Projects that mainstream CCA measures at the local/LGU level included the Philippine Climate Change Adaptation Project ($5M), Additional Financing for the Laguna de Bay Institutional Strengthening and Community
Participation Project ($10M), Additional Financing for the KALAHI‐CIDSS Project ($59M), Philippine Rural Development Project ($500M), Participatory Irrigation Development Project ($70M). For DRRM, the proxy indicator
for this was integrated into the SSLIP and RIGP operations. However, due to delays in processing, there was not an adequate time to demonstrate uptake among LGUs of these facilities within the CAS period.



The program fell short of increasing the volume of Emission
Reduction Purchase Agreements (ERPAs). This is due to the fact
that a number of CDM projects counted as part of the baseline
were dropped due to delays or were rejected by the UNFCCC. This
reduction in the WBG’s ERPA portfolio could not be offset by the
addition of three new Emission Reduction Purchase Agreements
(ERPAs) signed during the period. Only two ERPAs with a
combined volume of 302,000 tCO2e were singed by the Bank after
February 2009. For a third CDM project, based on a World Bank
GEF operation, an ERPA for 610,000 tCO2e was signed with KfW
as the buyer – bringing the total to 46% of the period target. Due
to the downturn in the global carbon markets, two of the three
ERPAs were terminated or cancelled later and for the third, the
Philippine Methane Recovery project with Land Bank, the ERPA
was amended to deliver only 12,000 tCO2e – however, with the
expectation that Land Bank would sign a new ERPA with the
World Bank Carbon Partnership Facility for a yet unknown volume
to be delivered in the 2nd Kyoto Protocol Commitment Period.
Despite missing the key indicator on ERPAs, other Bank projects
have contributed to the mitigation of GHG: The Rural Power
Project has expanded mitigation programs by supporting wider
use of renewable energy technology. Through the project, six
renewable energy companies are accredited and doing business,
resulting in over 25,000 tons of CO2 emissions each year. The
project has also connected about 19,500 solar systems in rural
areas, and has supported RET TA training to public and private
company staff. The Electric Cooperative System Loss Reduction
Project has focused on increasing energy efficiency in rural power
sector through GEF‐funded Partial Credit Guarantee Program.
Assets are now coming on line, contributing to avoiding emissions
with the goal of 400,000 of CO2 avoided annually. IFC’s

The baseline number of IDPs came about as a result of the spike in

Conflict‐sensitive programming and implementation has been
introduced to both the Mindanao Trust Fund (MTF‐RDP) and the
ARMM Social Fund Project. The Community‐Driven
Reconstruction sub‐component of the MTF‐RDP has provided
services to nearly 7000 IDP families. The WB under the State‐ and
Peace‐Building Fund joined with UN‐WFP on a survey in Central
Mindanao; the UN Humanitarian Action Plan for 2010‐2011
greatly benefitted from the report’s assessment on the links
between conflict, displacement, and economic development.
Peace and conflict‐impact assessment and conflict analysis have
been embedded into Mindanao Trust Fund – Reconstruction &
Development and ARMM Social Fund Project operations manual.
It is more difficult to determine whether programs have had an
“enhanced” impact. Despite strong progress, the CAS targets were
mostly based on outputs/coverage targets of WB projects and
didn’t delve into impacts and outcomes. Whether WB programs
are having major spillover effects to improve local governance and
to embed conflict‐sensitive approaches to development remains
an open question.
The governance‐based selection criteria for municipal block grants
under the MTF‐RDP also represent a conflict‐sensitive approach
and could be a possible model for future local government

competitive public bidding compared to an average of 3% in 2008.
53% of procuring entities post awarded contracts on the
Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System website,
PhilGEPs, short of full compliance, but an improvement over the
20% of procuring entities doing so in 2008.
The 2012 CPAR found the remaining key weaknesses for
procurement operations and the public procurement market: staff
required to undertake procurement activities on an ad hoc basis
lack required procurement competence; bidders have difficulty in
getting the required licenses and permits for bidding purposes;
procurement training for the private sector and bidders are not
responsive to the large demand for training of the private sector.
Since 2007, the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB)
embarked on a series of activities to ensure that the procurement
law is implemented and enforced, as well as monitored and
evaluated. The GPPB developed the Agency Procurement
Compliance and Performance Indicator (APCPI) system based on
actual procurement data and statistics pilot tested in 17 agencies
starting 2009. Procuring entities conducted series of continuing
trainings for its procurement staff and bidders on the
procurement law using the Harmonized Procurement Documents
(bidding documents, manuals and contract forms). The
Commission on Audit issued the Guide in the Audit of
Procurement to guide its auditors in conducting procurement
audit as part of the regular Annual Audit. The country’s public

“lump‐sum” appropriations and comprehensive release of

adoption of zero‐based budgeting to align public spending with
development objectives and evaluate budget allocations also
represents progress.
The government’s policy initiatives were supported with the Bank
providing just‐in‐time policy advice on PFM and South‐South
Knowledge Exchange for the GIFMIS working groups as well as
technical assistance to support reforms in policy‐based budgeting
through an IDF project in the DBM,. The PFM Reform Roadmap is
one of the important outputs of these activities and this is
followed through by government through its own resources and
with assistance from other development partners, especially
AusAID whose A$30 million PFM Programme’s design was aligned
with the Government’s emerging PFM reform priorities based
partly on the Bank’s peer review advice. Through the Governance
Partnership Facility, the Bank supported new arrangements for
more intensive collaboration among civil society organizations and
government to promote transparency, accountability and
participation in the preparation, authorization, execution and
monitoring of the national budget. This was the foundation for
the creation of the Open Budget Partnership, which facilitated the
participation of various CSOs in the scrutiny and analysis of
government’s budget plans and reports in line with their policy
advocacies.
The Bank‐led Post –Disaster Needs Assessment was mandated to
monitor and evaluate projects as well as to provide transparency
and accountability on the sourcing and disbursement of funds.
This was done through the development of a Reconstruction
Monitoring and Evaluation System (RMES), with technical
assistance from the Bank that highlighted international best
practice.
IBRD has supported improving transparency in the road sector
through NRIMP2 and the creation of Road Watch ‐ a partnership
with non‐governmental organizations, the private sector, and
development partners, including road users, service providers,
governance advocates, academe, and media. It functions as an
independent monitoring body which aims to promote quality road
services responsive to user needs through the efficient,

LGUs participating in programs that measure and provide
incentives for transparency and financial accountability. DILG
developed the PCF to provide LGUs that attained the SGH with
access to capital grants for local investments that are consistent
with national government priorities. DILG is pursuing the
expanded adoption of the SGH as a requirement for LGUs to
access financial assistance from the Bottom‐Up Budgeting
program (introduced in 2012) and from sectoral programs of
national sectoral agencies.
The Bank has provided on‐going TA to DILG to strengthen the
design and implementation of the PCF and to support the
development of a strategic national policy on incentives for LGUs.
The Bank is also finalizing a Local Governance Strategy to
operationalize local governance and social accountability
mechanisms in its operations, including the adoption of the SGH
and the Bottom‐Up Budgeting program processes in the design of
pipeline operations (including the Secondary & Local Roads
Project, National CDD Program, Manila Bay IWQM, PRDP). Finally,
the Bank has been supporting the efforts of DILG to
institutionalize the local governance reforms by partnering with
civil society in the implementation and oversight of DILG
programs.

CASCR Annex 2: Additional Lessons and Suggestions for the New CPS

CAS OBJECTIVE 1: STABLE MACRO ECONOMY
Results Area 1: Fiscal and Financial Stability through Consolidation and Improved Macroeconomic Risk
Management







Building on the progress made under this SO, the Government now needs to look at the second wave of
structural reforms, following the initial focus on macro stabilization. The Bank should help assess the
political economy of reform and the proper sequencing of reform implementation. These assessments
should also help set realistic goals and expectations about institutional reform progress and prospects
in key line agencies. A key take‐away from the CAS period is the need for continual and focused
dialogue to gain real support on issues of institutional reform.
Significant effort is still needed to ensure that key risks continue to be managed, particularly those
stemming from large contingent liabilities tied to GOCCs, PPPs, GFIs, natural disasters and a high degree
of conglomeration in the economy.
The next phase of engagement involves shifting from action plans to implementation, notably in inter‐
agency and legislative bound agendas. The shift in phases has implications for the areas and types of
engagement the Bank pursues. Valuable knowledge work to support implementation could include:
documenting examples of engagement where the Bank and other development partners have
successfully overcome fragmented government structure and processes; how to achieve better
collaboration and coordination between multiple agencies; and how to gain traction during
implementation.
Given the progress made in better aligning budgets with development priorities, the Bank might now
consider AAA on budget execution by agencies to help DBM and NEDA better understand where
efficiencies/inefficiencies are in public spending on development priorities.

CAS OBJECTIVE 2: IMPROVED INVESTMENT CLIMATE
Results Area 1: Enabling Business Environment to Promote Competitiveness, Productivity, and Employment








Elements of SO2 may not have had full government support at the beginning of the CAS period, as it
was not clear whether there was a shared vision with the previous administration. However, a strong
AAA program allowed the Bank to stay engaged and laid much of the groundwork when the political
climate changed. The AAA also helped the new administration to keep their focus forward‐looking and
increased traction on important reforms.
A reform agenda focused on economic growth depends significantly on the private sector. Therefore
the WBG should engage more with the private sector on investment climate reform going forward. This
work should be selectively targeted, focusing on supporting key sectors.
WBG should definitely remain engaged in the PPP Program. The current wave of engagement involves
transaction preparation which could be expanded to cover other sectors. Ensuring that institutions are
prepared for the changes that will be brought about with PPP could also be supported. Specifically,
agencies will need capacities to monitor contracts and implement the regulatory regime adopted in
specific transactions.
Improving the investment climate requires a long time frame. The WBG needs to think about how best
to provide support to ensure sustainable long‐term progress given shorter‐term political realities.
In terms of CAS Results design, it is important that the number of indicators and milestones from a
particular sector are commensurate with the WBG’s engagement in the area.

101




IFC‐IBRD collaboration can be better achieved by developing common and coordinated strategies for
key areas.
The administration’s ambitious agenda for the land sector may strain the capacity of implementing
agencies, suggesting the need for strategic technical assistance and capacity building.

Results Area 2.2 – Financial Services




The conservative approach to banking supervision, limited competition in the banking sector,
deficiencies in the regulatory environment, and an inadequate legal framework and institutional
structures contribute to the low levels of finance for MSMEs and a lack of availability of basic financial
services. Cooperatives play an important role in delivering basic financial services to MSMEs and low
income populations but lack adequate supervisory framework and institutional infrastructure.
Deficiencies in the capital markets and insurance sector regulatory framework and implementation
constrain the development of the local capital markets and insurance.
Rising urban poverty amidst rapid urbanization, the proliferation of slums in urban areas, and the lack
of access to affordable housing finance has made the housing sector a more prominent development
challenge. More IFC‐IBRD collaboration in housing finance should be explored.

CAS OBJECTIVE 3: BETTER PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY
Results Area 3.1 – Public Service Delivery in Key Sectors






In education, the CPS should focus on, among other areas: donor harmonization; a limited number of
critical reforms; linking basic education and post‐basic education; implementation of convergence
policy; decentralization; better budget execution; increased performance incentives; and better
monitoring and evaluation.
In health, the focus should be on: sustaining engagement on the government’s strategy to achieve
universal health care (but not necessary to increase levels of financing) and exploring a TA component
to support AAA. Data issues are particularly prevalent, due primarily to fragmented institutions and
their lack of capacity to monitor. Addressing data limitations should be linked to institutional reforms.
In water and sanitation, the sector needs a clear strategy to underpin CPS engagement, with a strong
focus on institutional and policy reforms. A major binding constraint in the sector is linked to the
fragmentation of institutions and lack of monitoring and oversight capacity, particularly in the rural and
water supply and sanitation sector. There is also a need to define sector baselines, monitoring, and
performance evaluations. Within the Bank, different units implementing WSS projects need a common
platform to systematically monitor and evaluate performance. Counterpart capacity is a key factor of
whether outcomes are achieved or not. Longer preparation and implementation periods, more
intensive coordination of stakeholders, and larger cost‐sharing subsidies are likely to be required to
achieve successful outcomes. The merit of involving the private sector in future operations as a way to
extend the implementation capacity of LGUs should be considered. Task teams also need to be more
intentional in generating (new) knowledge by developing clear knowledge agenda upfront.

Results Area 3.2 – Basic Service Delivery in Poor Areas


Impact evaluation of KALAHI‐CIDSS shows areas for improvements. Among the evaluation’s mains
lessons are: the need to consider varying municipal allocations by poverty levels, given that the
program’s impact on consumption levels are stronger on poorer household; the need for greater LGU
involvement and better integration of project processes with the local planning cycle. Going forward,

102



engagement on CDD should be sustained, including through TA related to helping the government in
defining a more integrated and inter‐agency engagement with stronger link to local governance. This
will include having more knowledge exchanges with other countries with national CDD programs. WB
should also continue to play an important role in undertaking strategic analytical work.
A number of initiatives could serve as building blocks for area‐based approaches going forward,
including the integration of health and education delivery mechanisms in support of the conditional
cash transfer program; the adoption of Bottom‐up Budgeting (BUB), and supporting more coordinated
approaches to urban development, especially in Metro Manila.

CAS OBJECTIVE 4: REDUCED VULNERABILITIES
Results Area 4.1: Social Protection System


The Philippines has made large strides in terms of social protection and is now a leader in the East Asia
and Pacific Region. The NHTS‐PR is also a significant asset for the country that not only identifies the
poor, but facilitates the convergence of social programs. The Bank is well positioned to help GOP think
through the next steps in building a more modern and comprehensive social safety net system that
includes other segments of the population (the elderly poor, the poor without children, the disabled)
and links poor households to savings, micro‐finance, and small business opportunities.

Results Area 4.2 – Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change






On DRRM, the WB needs to continue to build on the gains of the CAS period. TA activities should be
used to ensure that results are scaled up and institutionalized. Mainstreaming DRRM and building
resilience into the CDD program, agriculture, and other sectors is crucial. Implementing DRRM
necessitates organizing a composite Bank team with cross‐sector staff from both DC and Manila, as well
as staff working on disaster risk financing from GFDRR and Treasury.
On climate change adaptation, the WBG should continue to support: capacity building and the
development of tools; implementation of adaptation programs in vulnerable sectors; climate resiliency
and prioritization of budgets of key sector agencies and LGUs. Institutional capacity is a challenge which
will remain an issue for some time, as is the absorptive capacity of the Government.
On climate change mitigation, a key lesson for the Bank was the degree to which the prolonged CDM
validation and registration process discouraged project entities from doing CDM projects. Being more
selective on mitigation may be appropriate going forward.

Results Area 4.3 – Stability & Peace





The WBG’s long‐term engagement has created a high level of trust and buy‐in on both sides of the
conflict that is valuable for development interventions. The analytical program on conflict has placed
the WBG back at the forefront of the international development community in this field. These last few
years have been a period of intensive learning. The coming CPS should be the time to turn the learning
into a more bold and ambitious lending program.
As the government has noted regarding the conflict‐affected areas, peace talks should be
complemented by the delivery of basic services, institution of good governance, people empowerment
and assistance for the return or resettlement of IDPs, policy reforms, and local economic development.
The WBG’s mix of instruments mostly comprises CDD and small rural development programming, along
with national projects such as CCT, health and education. These are appropriate programs for the area

103





and have a track record of delivering. What is lacking is a strong focus on job creation and spatially
integrative infrastructure investments.
CAS outcomes and indicators were realistic and achievable but could be improved to move into higher
level outcomes, including assessing impacts at the community and local governance levels.
One key change is to turn the conflict, security and development agenda into a multi‐sector effort. On
the operational side and even analytical, the Bank can achieve more if sector‐specific investments are
coordinated and conflict‐sensitive. This has mostly been lacking through the CAS period.
On the agency side, the WBG engages mostly with OPAPP, DSWD, ARMM Regional Government, the
Bangsamoro Development Agency and international donors. On some issues there may be a need to
broaden the engagement with security sector agencies.

CROSS‐CUTTING THEME: GOOD GOVERNANCE
Results Area 5.1 – Governance and Anticorruption in Selected National Government Agencies



Indicators for the CAS Results Matrix should be better connected to the intended outcome, and should
also better reflect the breadth of the CAS work program.
Performance‐based lending and social accountability work are two avenues for supporting good
governance going forward. LGUs that do not comply with government's Seal of Good Housekeeping
governance agenda should not receive support through the Bank’s engagement. This questions the
ongoing suitability of the GFI on‐lending model.

Results Area 5.2 – Procurement and Public Financial Management Reforms at National and Local Levels





The strategy of combining top‐down support on efficiency (SO1) and bottom‐up work trying to
determine where leakage and wasteful spending occurs (SO5) has been an effective approach.
The Bank’s direct involvement in the PFM reform roadmap implementation is winding down while the
tasks are picked up by AusAID. The Bank should have a continued role in providing an independent and
global perspective of PFM reform that ensures that the development of the Government Financial
Information Management System (GIFMIS) is on track and focused on the right results.
The Bank is well placed to help central government (DBM) in its task of upgrading line agencies’ budget
management and execution.

Results Area 5.3 – Better Local Governance through More Effective Decentralization



The local governance agenda initiated by DILG is already in the process of being scaled‐up and applied
more broadly across sector programs in partnership with other national agencies. Given the significant
progress achieved thus far, the Bank should maintain its engagement in this area.
Key challenges remain, both in terms of the reliance on reform “champions” among national agency
leadership and in terms of the capacity constraints of government. Nonetheless, the lessons from the
implementation of the CAS indicate that the Bank is a valued partner of government in local governance
reforms and is capable of effectively providing technical assistance and advisory services that are
responsive to their needs.

Annex 4: World Bank FY13 Client Survey and CPS Multi‐Stakeholder Consultations
World Bank Group FY13 Client Survey for the Philippines
1. Background. In October and November 2012, the World Bank invited 1536 of its Philippines
stakeholders to participate in a survey on the Bank’s assistance to the country. The survey sought
respondent views on development issues facing the Philippines and their perceptions and attitudes
of the World Bank, including the efficacy and transparency of the Bank’s development interventions,
the ease of working with the Bank, and the future role of the Bank in the Philippines.
2. Process. Survey participants were drawn from civil society organizations, bilateral and
multilateral development agencies, government, government‐owned corporations, financial
institutions, the media, and the private sector. A total of 328 stakeholders participated in the survey
(21%). Respondents received and returned questionnaires via courier, post, or email.
3. Results. The FY13 Client Survey shows that positive views of the World Bank are shared across
stakeholder groups in a range of areas related to its work and outreach. The data suggests
improvements in a number of areas since the last survey was conducted in FY09. In addition to
positive views about the Bank, survey findings suggest that a large majority of stakeholders are
extremely optimistic about the future of the country, far more so than in FY09. Familiarity with the
Bank is quite high (7.1 on a 10 point scale) whereas familiarity with the IFC is lower (5.4). Similar to
other countries, there appears to be a positive correlation between respondents’ familiarity with the
Bank and their attitude towards it. To a high degree the survey findings validate the way the Bank
Group operates in the Philippines in terms of its work, outreach, and overall presence.
4. Areas of Focus. Corruption and governance were cited as the top development priorities among
respondents in the FY13 survey. Poverty slipped slightly in the rankings since the FY09 survey and
now ranks alongside growth, education, and agriculture. The majority of FY13 respondents report
that jobs are the key to reducing poverty, to a greater degree than they reported in FY09. Within this
context, stakeholders feel that the Bank’s greatest value is in agriculture, infrastructure, and
economic growth, followed by governance and corruption. Agriculture is considered a key to
economic growth, and along with infrastructure, is the area that most respondents would like to see
the Bank involved in.
5. WBG Effectiveness. Stakeholders’ views of World Bank effectiveness have improved significantly
since FY09 (6.6 to 7.3), with all sectors now rated above 7.0. Positive views of Bank effectiveness
appear to be related to perceptions of the Bank’s work in service delivery and governance and anti‐
corruption. As in FY09, stakeholders are comfortable with Bank involvement on corruption and
governance issues.
6. Value to the Client. Financing continues to be seen as the Bank’s greatest value but to a lesser
degree than in FY09 (cited by 30 percent of FY13 respondents compared to 50 percent in FY09).
Partnership and cooperation ranked second, followed by technical assistance. Views of the Bank’s
work on the ground are quite positive. Perceptions of staff accessibility have improved and the Bank
is perceived as open, straightforward, and responsive. Bank collaboration with government is seen as
extremely positive. The Bank’s engagement with groups outside government is also seen as positive
but to a lesser extent. Ratings are high in all areas related to the Bank’s knowledge. In fact, a plurality
of respondents from the House and Senate report that they use World Bank analytic work weekly (far
more than most stakeholders across the globe).

118

Development Priorities

Factors Contributing to Poverty Reduction

7. Looking forward. Perceptions of the Bank’s relevance have improved significantly since FY09 and
the environment is quite positive in terms of the Bank’s views of the future. Survey findings indicate
some areas where the Bank can improve its effectiveness. First, nearly forty percent of respondents
reported that reducing the complexity of Bank lending instruments is the main way the institution
can increase its value. This is of critical importance in a country where other sources of financing are
available. Capacity building was also cited as an area of strength for the Bank, and one which
represents a continuing opportunity given that nearly forty percent of respondents reported that the
biggest obstacle to reform is inadequate capacity. Finally, more than a quarter of respondents
reported that the Bank can be of greater value by providing more data/knowledge and statistics, that
they would like the Bank to offer more innovative knowledge products, and that the Bank should
improve the quality of its expertise.

119

WBG Focus

WBG’s Greatest Value in the Philippines

CPS Multi‐stakeholder Consultations
8. Background. Multi‐stakeholder consultations were held to gain insights from a range of
development actors in the Philippines on the main development challenges currently facing the
Philippines and to discuss key CPS themes. Building on the experience in the past CAS period and on
the WBG’s regular dialogue and outreach activities, the World Bank Group, together with the
Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs, which are partnerships between the World Bank Group
and leading state and private universities), organized multi‐stakeholder consultation workshops
across the country in October and November 2012, and February 2013. These workshops brought
together national and local government, civil society, the business community/private sector,
academe, and other development partners. In addition to the regional workshop, the WBG hosted
luncheons with key private sector representatives and civil society representatives in Makati City, and
conducted an on‐line consultation in November and December 2012, seeking targeted perspectives
on the same development issues as those discussed in the regional workshops.
9. Process. Five consultations were co‐organized with the Ateneo de Naga KDC for the consultation
in the Bicol Region; Central Philippine University KDC in Iloilo City for Central and Eastern Visayas;
University of Southeastern Philippines KDC in Davao City for Mindanao; Asian Institute of
Management KDC in Makati City for Metro Manila and neighboring areas in Luzon, and Notre Dame
University in Cotabato City for the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao.82 A total of 304
participants attended the workshops, from government, civil society, academe, the private sector,
and from other development partner institutions. These representatives were chosen from the
Bank’s wide network of contacts and partners at the national, regional, and local levels.
82

The fifth workshop in Cotabato City was added at the request of the Regional Executive Secretary of the ARMM during the workshop in
Davao City in November 2012.

120

10. Objectives and Structure. The consultations provided a venue for a meaningful exchange of
views with government and various stakeholders on critical development challenges as well as policy
options and programs to address these challenges. They also helped increase government and
stakeholder understanding of the Bank’s work in the Philippines. Participants were asked to share
their top development priorities/challenges for the Philippines, to offer key activities to address
these challenges, and to list the groups that should be called on to help address these challenges. In
this process, participants were asked to highlight the World Bank Group role. Representatives from
the Local Director’s Office of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) helped set
the stage at each workshop by providing an overview of the regional Economic Development Plan.
Each workshop was organized into breakout sessions structured around the Government’s Cabinet
Cluster organization: 1. Good Governance and Anti‐Corruption, 2. Human Development and Poverty
Reduction, 3. Economic Development, 4. Security, Justice and Peace, and 5. Climate Change
Adaptation and Mitigation.83 A consultant facilitated the workshop, and key staff from the World
Bank participated in the discussions.
11. Results. Consistent with the findings of the client survey, the overall mood of the events was
very positive in terms of the country’s recent achievements and future, and the role of the WBG in
the Philippines. Participants uniformly agreed on the proposed structure for WBG support, including
the strategic alignment of the Bank’s program with the government cluster structure. The new
structure came to life in the later meetings when each group title was made more specific and
concrete. From November onwards, the breakout group titles were changes to: 1. Helping
Government to be More Effective and Accountable, 2. Improving Social Service Delivery; Protecting
the Poor and Vulnerable, 3. Creating Opportunities for More and Better Jobs, 4. Building and
Sustaining Peace, and 5. Addressing Climate Change and Managing Disaster Risks. Participants
highlighted development challenges and offered constructive and concrete recommendations in each
of the areas:
Helping Government to be More Effective and Accountable




Political Economy: Some participants highlighted that in order to sustain reforms for inclusive
development and break the hold of entrenched interests, some political actors need to be
strengthened and certain political processes must be institutionalized. To support this process,
the Bank could study what kinds of political actions and processes are needed and how it can
help support them.
Local Government: Some participants highlighted the need for more transparent and
accountable local governance, and improved LGU service delivery. The Seal of Good
Housekeeping and other incentive systems were cited as ways to improve LGU performance.
There were calls for better delineation of responsibilities between the levels of government, and
increased resource allocations to LGUs, especially in remote areas. Some participants suggested
that the WB should directly support LGUs, and consult with them on development priorities.
Anti‐Corruption: Issues flagged included the need to support participatory governance and
genuine CSO/private sector dialogue. There were strong suggestions to sustain good governance
initiatives by enhancing recent anti‐corruption measures.
Public Financial Management: There were calls for the WBG to continue to support PFM and
integration of government data systems.

83

In the workshop in Cotabato City, the focus on peace and development was mainstreamed across all of the focus groups. As a result, there
was not a separate breakout group on security, peace and justice.

121



Policies: Some suggestions to increase coherence in national and local policies; improve taxation
and fiscal systems, and increase fiscal revenue through taxation of higher income brackets.
 Capacity: Many calls to support capacity building for government officials, across all levels of
government.
Improving Social Service Delivery; Protecting the Poor and Vulnerable


Major Issues cited: High population growth, high income inequality, protection of human rights,
poverty. Suggestions for the World Bank to focus more on the root causes of unequal
development with stronger engagement on pro‐poor development.
 Urban: Focuses included the issue of slum upgrading and addressing the rights of informal
settlers and indigenous peoples, especially on displacement and tenure security. Some
highlighted the need to reduce migrant influx to overcrowded urban areas. Other suggestions
included re‐examining building standards and conducting comprehensive risk analysis on high
risk settlements/populations.
 Rural/Farm: Suggestions to promote sustainable rural development while also addressing the
vulnerability of subsistence food‐producers through food security and safety nets; need for post‐
CARP rural and agricultural land reform and structural poverty alleviation in remote areas; calls
for more attention to addressing the issue of unequal center‐periphery distribution of assets
and resources.
 Social Protection. Calls for: ensuring the social protection and inclusion of vulnerable groups in
the development processes that affect them most; expanding CCT to other vulnerable groups
sectors (farmers and fisher folk, disabled, children of OFWs); considering converting CCT to
‘unconditional cash transfer’; sharing government CCT data.
 Policy/program coherence: Some highlighted need to: make social programs more coherent
(e.g. align health policies with social protection policies and education policies with labor
policies); increase LGU involvement in social service policy implementation, health and
education reforms; develop innovative CDD strategies.
 Health & Education: On health, calls for increasing coverage and providing financial resources at
the local level, as well as leveraging public funds through awareness campaigns and matching
co‐financing of WB funding. In education, issues cited included resource problems for both
private and public schools (e.g. facilities, faculty); concerns over the use of English at home vis‐à‐
vis the mother tongue in school; low awareness and appreciation of K‐12; need for more
capacity building of teachers and officials. Some participants called for WB funding for expanded
government assistance to students and teachers in private education for Grades 11 to 12. Also
calls to stimulate vocational training in rural areas, which was linked to the lack of health and
education workers, as well as health and education service delivery, in rural, remote, and
insecure areas.
Creating Opportunities for More and Better Jobs



Employment: Participants called for more job opportunities outside Manila with some
participants citing the need to convince job generators to locate themselves outside the Metro
Manila area.
Infrastructure: Participants cited the need to: increase public investments in infrastructure;
improve intra‐ and inter‐regional connectivity; improve traffic management in urban areas; and
increase coordination of infrastructure standards at national and local levels. On infrastructure
financing, some participants suggested the need to better package infrastructure projects for
investment. Some also suggested that the WBG should provide technical advice for planning and
prioritization of infrastructure projects

122



Rural/Agriculture: Among the issues discussed included the need to protect rural livelihoods
through: better land right policy; protecting fishing areas against illegal fishing; and improving
access to arable land. Extending land reform programs, cited in social service delivery
workshops, also came up in the context of job creation. Related to increasing livelihoods, some
participants noted the need to: improve access to agricultural support systems and increase
infrastructure to improve access to inputs and markets; increase value‐added activities in areas
of production; strengthen farmer and fisher folk organizations and link farmers, fishermen and
micro‐entrepreneurs with potential funding partners; and facilitate employment for young
Filipinos in their rural areas of origin. Some highlighted the need to involve LGUs, local NGOs and
people’s organizations in local planning. Suggestions for future work included: potential weather
insurance project for farmers, fishermen and micro‐entrepreneurs; addressing the issue of
ancestral domain; improving drinking water and electricity access in remote communities; and
stimulating local and foreign investment in rural businesses
 Financial Sector: Issues cited included: the need for financing institution liquidity and access to
finance for MSMEs and in renewable energy, among others sectors. There were calls for:
improving financial literacy and capital market development; strengthening information
disclosure systems (Credit Bureau) for risk assessment; developing collateral systems and a
movable collateral registry; fostering linkages between commercial banks and rural banks;
improving LGU awareness of financing options; strengthening government regulations for doing
business; financing livelihood programs; and providing financial assistance to local governments
for priority development projects. On PPPs, some participants cited the need to improve access
to financing, networks, and use of IFC advisory services;
 Labor Markets: Some participants highlighted the importance of quality education to the labor
market and the need for developing labor supply that matches employer demands. Some
highlighted the role of the private sector in education, and the need for developing professional
standards, better labor market information, and better access to technical schools.
Building and Sustaining Peace


Issues: Among the issues cited included: perceptions of an unstable business environment in
Mindanao and in post‐conflict areas; the lack of human resource skills and capacity;
administrative and bureaucratic barriers; potential elite capture of government; policy
incoherence between national and local governments; and donor‐driven projects that impose
external expertise. Participants also cited the need to carefully manage expectations, build
capacity and deliver services at the local level.
 Suggestions: Scale up IFC advisory services; continue community‐level work in the existing WB
programs (e.g. MRDP, CCT); provide tailored support for PFM and public expenditure reviews;
ensure transfer of knowledge to LGUs through the Open Data Initiative; draw lessons from other
countries and adapt to local settings; share information about international modes of wealth
sharing; promote CDD projects using local expertise; inform grassroots networks about the
peace process and the nature of the October 2012 Framework Agreement.
Addressing Climate Change and Managing Disaster Risks


Disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation: Some participants emphasized the
needs for: mainstreaming disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and capacity
building; building resilience of affected communities beyond ‘relief’ operations; developing
resilience technologies and capacities; building post‐disaster needs assessment with GIS
mapping; linking local urban renewal and rural development with disaster risk reduction and
climate change adaptation efforts; strengthening community‐based disaster risk‐climate change

123





response, adaptation and mitigation.
Environment/climate change. Some issues highlighted included the need for: researching the
impact of sea level rise, biodiversity loss, and climate change impacts on agricultural
productivity; supporting conservation of biodiversity areas near extractive industry operations
and preventing mining companies from polluting areas and surface water resources; developing
greenhouse gases accounting; supporting biogas digesters, sanitary landfill, and solid waste
management facilities; developing consistent environmental legislation;
LGUs: Suggestions included supporting LGU alliances for co‐managing watershed and ecological
systems; building LGU capacity on infrastructure standards, including on implementing an
infrastructure master plan.
Water: Suggestions included: doing a study on developing Laguna Lake as a water source as well
as other studies on water quality and institutional frameworks for water management; creating
an integrated watershed management program for Manila Bay, Pasig River and Laguna Lake;
financing wastewater treatment facilities and sanitary landfills; strengthening institutional
arrangements among all water management stakeholder.

124

Annex 5: IFC‐IBRD Collaboration in the Philippines
The IFC and IBRD are working together to provide integrated development solutions to enhance private
investments in key regions, commodities and sectors in support of the Government’s focus on
enhancing inclusive growth and elimination of extreme poverty through more rapid job creation. Joint
IFC‐IBRD coordination is being pursued in a focused manner in key sectors: investment climate,
agribusiness, the financial sector and infrastructure development (including PPPs, shipping and tourism).
IFC also participates in the weekly IBRD country management team meetings to track progress in the
four key sectors, and to identify other opportunities for enhanced collaboration.
Investment Climate
The WBG is jointly supporting Government efforts to improve the investment climate. IFC has helped
key Manila cities reduce red tape related to business entry reducing steps to register from an average of
19 to 1 in Manila. IFC has also supported national policy makers with Business Process and Licensing
Simplification (BPLS) program for LGUs and the evaluation of a national on‐line business registration
system (Philippine Business Registry or PBR). IBRD has included an Investment Climate component
directly linked to advancing reform associated with BPLS and PBR into the policy reforms supported by
the current series of DPLs, providing greater weight and an alternative channel of motivation to the GoP
to advance investment climate reforms. The IFC and IBRD are now working jointly to evaluate progress
to meeting the DPL policy objectives through DPL supervision reports and will jointly develop
Investment Climate policy objectives for the follow‐on DPL. The result of the joint engagement is high
level government attention to the simplification of the regulatory framework, which mainly affects
SMEs, an expansion of the BPLS program to include improved monitoring and evaluation, and a
Philippine Business Registry that is functioning in two pilot LGUs.
Agribusiness
There is a critical joint IFC‐IBRD focus on agricultural competiveness to support overall diversification of
the economy and to support the livelihoods of the rural poor. IFC’s Investment Climate team
coordinates with the IBRD team to work out an approach to regulatory work with key GoP stakeholders
including the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Transportation and Communications.
The IFC will focus on identifying firms interested in investing in the rural/ agricultural/ tourism sectors,
and work with them to formulate an investment strategy and business plan. IFC will also help define the
specific public goods that need to be provided to make the investments financially attractive, including
investments in road, port and air transport facilities, irrigation and water supply systems, farm to market
roads, and basic community infrastructure for the beneficiary communities. The IBRD will provide the
financing mechanisms through which this supporting infrastructure will be provided. It will also provide
extension services where necessary, support mobilization of local governments for provision of services,
and other public services that are needed by the private investors. Consistent with the WBG’s overall
approach in the Philippines, this work will be targeted to the areas with a high incidence of poverty and
unemployment. The joint WBG approach is being implemented to support a key banana production and
export investment in the conflict‐affected Bangsamoro region. Working with a well‐established
company, the proposed IFC investment will create 4,000 hectares of new farms and generate 6,000‐
7,000 jobs over three years, a large proportion of which will employ ex‐combatants of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front. This will support efforts to achieve peace and stability and address unemployment and
poverty in the Bangsamoro and help build private sector confidence and governance to provide citizen
security, justice and jobs to break the cycle of conflict and poverty. IFC will work with the potential
investor to define the business and investment plan and identify the public infrastructure that is
required for the investments to succeed, as well as provide benefits to the involved community. IBRD
will provide the necessary road infrastructure to link production, and communities with markets and

125

export facilities, irrigation and water supply as well as livelihood infrastructure required in the
communities. This initiative will be extended to other agribusiness players, both within and beyond
Bangsamoro with initial discussions already under way with companies involved in the coconut and
cacao crop sub sectors.
Infrastructure ‐ Public Private Partnership (PPP)
To support the Government in implementing its PPP Program, since 2011 the IFC and the IBRD have
been providing a coordinated and complementary package of assistance using a two‐track approach.
The two‐track approach enabled two distinct operations by IFC and IBRD, both with funding support
from AusAID, greater responsiveness and flexibility in mobilizing advisory support by allowing each to
offer established and tested products and operating mechanisms. IFC mobilizes support from various
donors for its transaction advisory activities, and the AusAID support contributes for this purpose. The
objective of this technical assistance program is to provide direct advisory support to the Government in
a number of areas where the WBG has a comparative advantage in project development and
preparation, such as in infrastructure (e.g., transport, energy, water) and agriculture. The intent has
been to support Government’s objectives for achieving results on the ground quickly for a number of
key priority projects under preparation as well as to develop a robust project pipeline for succeeding
years, and build internal capacities in the preparation/ structuring/ tendering of PPP projects.
IBRD is engaged in upstream activities such as preparing the Metro Manila bus rapid transit (BRT)
project, liquefied natural gas (LNG) strategy, electric cooperatives PPP strategy, water supply and
sanitation options, Metro Manila flood mitigation interventions, and agro‐food park strategy. The TA
program mainly involves mobilizing consultants working under the supervision of WBG sector and PPP
specialists in coordination with the different agencies to realize the stated objectives. IBRD is also
supporting building up the capacity of the Government’s PPP Center. IFC is engaged in transaction
advisory for PPP projects in the expressway, light rail, port and agribusiness sectors. The approach
involves mobilizing internal teams, with members coming from other IFC PPP units in HQ and the region.
IFC and IBRD together stand ready to support government’s continuing efforts to improve and increase
the delivery of infrastructure. As the government has announced a stronger role in matching projects
and financing mechanisms/development partners, IBRD and IFC will take the guidance from government
on future endeavors. In the PPP projects where IFC is transaction advisor, there are opportunities to
introduce IBRD participation through various modes and instruments such as viability gap financing
(VGF), partial risk guarantee (PRG), etc. to promote project bankability and enhance the competition by
attracting new players into the PPP playing field.
Shipping and Ports
IFC and IBRD are providing joint advice to the government on the issue of domestic shipping reform,
cabotage liberalization, and ports infrastructure development, with a view to possible amendments of
existing laws or other pertinent rules and regulations in the water transport sector. The objective is to
increase efficiency in supply logistics and reduce shipping costs.
Tourism
IBRD is providing TA to the government on strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of its ongoing
Tourism Roads Infrastructure Program (TRIP). This has allowed IBRD to open a dialog with the
Department of Tourism on future areas of collaboration that could involve IFC participation. A potential
for joint IFC‐IBRD activity is to provide support to one or two designated tourism destination areas in the
development of support infrastructure and mobilizing private sector initiatives in tourism. As the
government is gearing up to host the APEC summit in 2015 and will begin to prepare the summit venues
in the different areas, one or two sites could be identified as the core areas of a joint IFC‐IBRD TA on an
area‐based tourism development program.
126

Annex 6: The World Bank Institute Contribution to Philippines CPS: FY15‐FY18
The World Bank Institute’s (WBI’s) support to the Philippines CPF will focus on capacity development
interventions around three main areas: (i) Leadership, (ii) Social Accountability, and (iii) Urban programs.
Working closely with World Bank operational teams, WBI aims to contribute towards the Reform and
Results agenda of the Government of Philippines, as articulated in the Social Contract between the
current Administration and citizens of Philippines. This will be achieved by:
Developing Capacity to support modernization of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).
In collaboration with PREM, WBI will support the establishment of a Results Team within DBM, by
developing the team’s leadership capacity in driving the reform/results agenda across line agencies. The
team is comprised of officials from DBM, line and oversight agencies. One of the key challenges that line
and oversight agencies will have to address is the need to modernize the bureaucracy, so that
organizational structures, staffing and compensation systems, provide an enabling environment for
reform initiatives. Based on discussions with DBM’s senior leadership, the Results Unit will focus initially
on three to four priority programs to be selected from the following: (a) Enhancing the livelihood of
poor fishermen; (b) Improving tourism related services; (c) improving the livelihood of coconut farmers;
(d) tackling traffic congestion in Metro Manila; and (e) addressing the livelihood and post‐support
environment of graduates of the Conditional Cash Transfer Program. WBI’s Leadership program will
utilize its Rapid Results Initiatives and Leadership for Results tools to support DBM’s objective.
Supporting Education Sector Reforms, specifically to improve budget utilization and quality of
education through effective citizen engagement. WBI will support the design and implementation of
social accountability mechanisms aimed at strengthening citizens’ feedback on education service
delivery. Interventions will include: (a) Supporting the design of the education PETS/QSDS to incorporate
participation of civil society organizations, undertaking capacity development to improve their capacity
to monitor education expenditure; and (b) Supporting the Learning, Equity, and Accountability Program
(LEAPS) to strengthen the quality of education through revisions to the DepEd school report card and
innovations in demand‐side report cards. These initiatives will draw from local and global learning
through structured learning and south‐south knowledge and experience sharing. WBI will leverage its
collaboration with local/regional partners such as ANSA‐EAP (Affiliated Network for Social Accountability
– EAP).
Complementing the World Bank Urban Program, focusing on the Housing/Shelter sector. WBI and WB
Urban teams are supporting the Philippines government’s efforts in addressing the challenges of
millions living in slums, particularly the most vulnerable families affected by the flood problem in
Manila. WBI support includes facilitation of south‐south knowledge exchanges and development of
capacity around housing and shelter reforms, including contributions to the development of the
National Informal Settlement Upgrading Strategy, and strengthening the institutional capacity of Social
Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC), and National Housing Authority (NHA) to scale up participatory
city‐wide slum upgrading and sustainable affordable housing programs.

127

Annex 7: Partnership
Background
1.
This Annex provides an overview of major official development assistance (ODA) activities in the
Philippines, organized according to the five engagement areas of the CPS. The mapping was based on
updates from the ODA agencies on their current or upcoming country strategies. This Annex does not
capture all the development partners and their areas of involvement in the Philippines; smaller ODA
programs or indirect ODA support, may not all be included here. The Annex gives an indication of where
there is potential for further Bank support, as well as areas where collaboration with other ODA partners
can be pursued or strengthened.
2.
According to the Government's latest ODA Portfolio Review for Calendar Year 2012 (CY12), the
Philippines' total ODA amounts to US$11.7 billion, 75% of which is composed of loans while the rest is
composed of grants. The total commitment of the Government's loan portfolio was at US$8.82 billion
covering 70 project loans and ten program loans. The CY12 commitment level increased by 3% from
CY11's US$8.6 billion. As of December 2012, Japan remained the biggest source of lending assistance
(US$3.26 billion or 37%), followed by the Bank (US$1.839 or 21%), and then ADB with US$1.371 billion
or 13%. In terms of grants, total cumulative grant assistance amounted to US$2.9 billion covering 400
projects supported by 14 development partners. The leading providers were Australia (US$934.87
million or 32.8%), USA through USAID and Millennium Challenge Account (US$852.18 million or 29.9%)
and the UN System (US$316.51 million or 11.1%).
Collaboration in General Areas
3.
Dialogue and broad collaboration on the country’s policy reform agenda is facilitated among
development partners through the Philippines Development Forum (PDF). As Co‐Chair of the PDF, the
WBG serves as convener of a small development partners group that meets regularly (around 5‐6 times
a year) to discuss major developments in the country and their impact on ODA programs, and potential
collaboration under the various ODA programs. The WBG is also co‐convener of serveral working groups
under the PDF: Growth and Investment Climate; Mindanao, and Local Government, as well as other sub‐
working groups.
4.
In more specific areas, collaboration is undertaken bilaterally or among several development
partners which have similar concerns on operational matters or business processes. For example, WB,
ADB and JICA conduct joint portfolio reviews through joint analytical work with the Government to
address generic project implementation issues that impact on the three agencies’ portfolios. Also, WB
has been working with other development partners, but more especially with ADB and JICA, on the
harmonization agenda in the areas of procurement, use of country systems, safeguards, and other
business processes or operational matters. Finally, on more specific sectors or theme, the following
sections outline areas of specific engagement areas under the CPS and development partners who are
active under each.
Specific Areas for Collaboration
Engagement Area 1: Transparent and Accountable Government
6.
Several development partners are heavily involved in supporting the Government in its pursuit
of strengthening its public finances and enhancing its accountability, transparency, and participatory
nature. Together with the WBG, the ADB, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, UN, and the USA are other
major ODA partners with activities that directly support revenue administration, public expenditure
management, public financial management, public sector institutional reforms, local governance
reforms, and Government accountability through open government initiatives such as budget
transparency, including CSO monitoring of budget execution. In particular, the WBG is working in close

128

partnership with Australia through an Umbrella Trust Fund administered by the WBG which supports,
among others, public expenditure management, open government reforms, and budget accountability.
Through an initiative called the Partnership for Growth (PFG), USA Government agencies are working
collaboratively with multiple Philippine Government departments, the judiciary, civil society and the
private sector to improve the regulatory environment, combat corruption, and strengthen the rule of
law in support of more accountability in Government.
7.
In the area of local government, ADB, Australia, the EU, France, Spain, and the USA have strong
programs supporting local government initiatives in general, or in particularly targeted LGUs. Canada
together with Australia, is supporting a Decentralization and Local Government Trust Fund (DIALOG TF)
administered by the WBG to support the Government’s reform agenda for local governments. The USA
is working with a select group of local governments and other stakeholders in cities that have potential
for becoming engines of growth and innovation which could fuel development in surrounding areas.
Support is provided through a common agenda identified by the PDF working group on Decentralization
and Local Government, which encompasses extensive support for policy reforms and innovative
programs that promote local government transparency and accountability, and which facilitate the
constructive engagement of citizens in local governance.
8.
In addition, on the Government’s overall fiscal and fiscal risk management aspect, the IMF is
engaged through its ongoing annual Article IV consultations and technical assistance. Given the WBG’s
engagement in this area, it is expected that the World Bank will continue to coordinate with the IMF on
joint financial sector assessments for the country.
Engagement Area 2: Empowerment of the Poor and Vulnerable
9.
ADB, Australia, the EU, Germany, Japan, Spain, UN, and the USA all have programs that
support social service delivery and empowering the poor and vulnerable. These consist of various forms
of assistance targeted at poor communities, municipalities, cities, provinces, and/or regions related to
addressing the MDGs, particularly on health, education and poverty levels, and including community‐
driven development approaches.
10.
Programs of the ADB in health are winding down but Australia, the EU, Germany, Japan, Spain,
UN, and USA continue to have substantial programs in the health sector. The USA is collaborating with
the Department of Health and community health workers to increase the demand for and utilization of
quality services for family planning, maternal and child health and TB. In the basic education sector,
Australia, Spain, UN, and the USA have programs which support the Government’s same basic
education reform agenda that the WBG is also supporting. On specific focus on the poor and vulnerable
the Government’s main program is the conditional cash transfer program (Pantawid Pamilayng Pilipino
Program or 4Ps), which is supported by the ADB, UN, and the WBG. The National Household Targeting
System (NHTS), funded under the WBG’s project, is intended to ensure that the program targets the
poorest families within the Program’s criteria. Under the Australian‐funded Umbrella Trust Fund,
support is provided to various initiatives jointly identified for social protection, public financial
management, local governance, statistical development, education and public private partnerships in
infrastructure. The USA is supporting the Philippine Government’s community driven development
project for delivery of social services through USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation.
Engagement Area 3: Rapid, Inclusive, and Sustained Economic Growth
11.
Given the broad coverage of this engagement area, it has the biggest confluence of ODA
programs. The programs which support this results area include some relatively large infrastructure
programs of the ADB, China, France, Korea, and Japan covering basic infrastructure such as national
roads/highways, power projects, bridges, and water supply and sanitation projects that support the

129

overall growth agenda. Almost all of the key development partners support interventions that help
increase economic growth, productivity and employment in rural areas. Specifically, some partners such
as ADB, Spain, and the USA are supporting small and medium enterprise development for priority
sectors and micro‐enterprise development as well as community‐level education and health facilities (in
the case of Spain) and community‐based rural infrastructure (in the case of the WBG). The USA,
through the Partnership for Growth, and the UN support both national and local measures to improve
the competitiveness of the Philippines, facilitate trade, and improve investment flows. The EU and the
USA have major technical assistance programs supporting trade policy, standards, exports capacity,
customs reform and competition. The USA and Japan are supporting the “industry cluster approach”
which is the national program of the Philippines to enhance several prioritized industries through the
collaboration among private sector, academe, and public sector. The USA is helping to strengthen
science, technology, research and innovation capacity and is promoting entrepreneurship based on
science and technology. The WBG, through IFC is active in this area as it seeks to increase private sector
investments in infrastructure through public‐private partnerships (PPP) and through support to micro‐
enterprise growth through its program, aside from policy advice and technical assistance as requested
by the Government. ADB, Australia, Canada and the USA are providing institutional strengthening
support to the Government’s PPP Center.
12.
Support to PPP in particular is one of three areas that the WBG and four other development
partners – ADB, Australia, Japan and the USA ‐‐ have identified as a specific area for collaboration. The
five development partners have discussed and agreed on a coordinated approach to draw strength from
each other’s comparative advantage in supporting the Government’s PPP agenda.
13.
Various development partners like ADB, Australia, IMF, Japan, UN and the USA support
strengthening of the Government’s economic and fiscal policy. This is supported, directly or indirectly,
through technical assistance, projects or policy‐based loans that incorporate advice or knowledge‐
sharing as inputs to Government’s policy reform agenda on macroeconomic and fiscal matters.
Engagement Area 4: Climate Change, Environment, and Disaster Risk Management
14.
In this area, the WBG is working with the GoP on developing a policy framework for addressing
fiscal risks linked to disasters, a pool for risk sharing and financing, and a strategy that will enhance the
GoP’s catastrophe risk modeling that will address the fiscal risk. This will require close collaboration with
many other development partners, but more especially ADB, the USA, Australia, France, Japan, and
Spain, whose country program priorities include climate change, environmental resilience and disaster
risk management. ADB is working with the Insurance Commission (IC) in structuring the framework of
the public‐private insurance pool for earthquakes, while JICA is in discussion with the Government and
WB for a possible DPL operation on climate change. The USA is working with the Commission on Climate
Change on mitigation and adaptation issues. Working with local governments on disaster risk
management is also an area where close coordination is needed because many development partners
are providing support to local governments for capacity building in different areas. Some of them,
including the USA, Spain and the UN, are currently supporting both local and national capacity‐building
projects in DRR and Emergency Response.
15.
Addressing climate change and disaster risk management, as it relates specifically to Metro
Manila, was identified as an area which requires a huge amount of support in terms of both technical
assistance and investments. ADB, Australia, France, Japan, and UN, together with the WBG, are all
either actively engaged or are planning to be actively engaged in supporting Metro Manila in various
sectors: flood management (water and wastewater management), risk assessment, strengthening
organizational capacity development for the implementation of various policies, and inclusiveness
(resettlement/housing, livelihood, and social protection). Metro Manila is a high risk area with great

130

potential, and it has been acknowledged that it would be critical to plan how to foster better
harmonization and implementation of various development partners’ support to Metro Manila.
16.
Finally, there is strong linkage between environmental sustainability, low carbon development,
disaster risk reduction and climate risk resilience to the overall sustainable development agenda. In that
regard, improved natural resource management and sustainable development presents a broad
outcome to which many development partners are contributing through various forms of interventions.
Engagement Area 5: Peace, Institution Building, and Social and Economic Opportunity
17.
With the changes in the leadership of the Supreme Court and the Office of the Ombudsman
under this administration as well as the active leadership at the Department of Justice, ODA partners
have become more active in the area of, and dialogue on improving the administration of justice. Forms
of assistance provided by several development partners include strengthening the judiciary, supporting
advocacy for judicial reforms, improving the barangay justice system, and specific justice programs for
children. ODA partners with activities in this area include EU, ADB, Australia, Canada, Spain (with
special emphasis in Human Rights), UN, and the USA (with a focus on improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of courts and strengthening the enforcement of contracts and intellectual property rights).
These are expected to contribute to increased trust within commitments and between citizens in
general.
18.
Peace and stability are essential for economic development and vice‐versa. The peace and
stability agenda of many development partners primarily refer to programs for Mindanao, which covers
post‐conflict areas. Many development partners ‐‐ Australia, Canada, EU, Germany, Japan, Spain, UN,
and the USA have active programs in Mindanao. Some of their support is provided through the multi‐
donor Mindanao Trust Fund administered by the World Bank, as well as through their own programs.
Assistance may be in the form of targeted programs for specific areas in Mindanao and/or for specific
sectors in Mindanao. The range of programs include almost all types of interventions ‐‐ from large to
small‐scale infrastructure, from National Government‐ to LGU‐ to civil society ‐ or community‐based
assistance, from livelihood to institution‐building activities, and from post‐conflict to peace and
development interventions, not necessarily limited to the Mindanao area.
19.
With the signing in March 2014 of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro between
the GoP and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (a major rebel group in Muslim Mindanao), and once the
institutional mechanisms are deemed ready, more and higher levels of ODA assistance are expected to
be channeled to the proposed new Bangsamoro area, which is expected to replace the current
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The UN and WB recently agreed with the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front to establish the Facility for Advisory Support for Transition Capacities (FASTRAC). The
Bank plays an active role in coordinating ODA for Mindanao in partnership with the Government and
other ODA partners through the FASTRAC and the co‐convenership of the PDF working group on
Mindanao, as well as through the chairmanship of the steering committee for the Mindanao Trust Fund.
Summary Matrix
20.
The following matrix indicates presence of ODA partners in each engagement area of the CPS.
There are certain sectors where there is a proliferation of ODA activities while in other there may be
less. This could be explained by the large financing requirements in one sector relative to others, on one
hand, and the availability of private sector and government financing on the other hand.

Annex 8: Country Gender Plan – Mainstreaming Gender
The PH Country Gender Action Plan (CGAP) for FY15‐18 supports the goals of the new Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY15‐18 which are to promote inclusive growth, reduce poverty and support
shared prosperity. Specifically, the CGAP aims to mainstream gender dimensions in the various
engagement areas of the CPS as broadly described below:
Engagement Area 1: Transparent and accountable Government: The Bank will continue to support and
deepen gender mainstreaming in operations by strengthening gender analysis to inform new programs;
linking gender actions to meaningful monitoring; and, supporting multi‐stakeholder policy dialogues on
key emerging gender issues.
Engagement Area 2: Empowerment of the poor and vulnerable: This would entail continued investment
projects or policy advice on key public services that address some of the persistent gender‐related
issues. Specifically, the CPS will continue to support the promotion of equal access to education among
boys and girls mainly through the proposed Learning Equity and Accountability Program Support (LEAPS)
and related analytical work. In addition, the Bank will contribute to the promotion of improved access
to maternal care through the Philippine conditional cash transfer (Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program)
and through continued policy dialogue with the Philippine government on universal health care. Gender
dimension will also be strengthened in water and sanitation policy and program initiatives. In addition,
the scaled‐up operations of the community‐driven development approach will continue to serve as
platform for promoting gender equality in governance and community‐managed basic service delivery.
In terms of analytical work, the Bank will pursue possible study on teenage pregnancy as one of the
major causes of maternal mortality and other policy issues on maternal mortality such as the
rationalization of nurses deployment.
Engagement Area 3: Rapid, inclusive and sustained economic growth: This would entail the promotion
of equal economic opportunities for women through increased and improved delivery of gender‐
responsive infrastructure for greater access to rural areas. The Philippine Government, with support of
the Bank has strengthened its operational guidelines on gender dimensions in transportation and will
continue to do so in new investment projects. Likewise, gender dimension of flood‐control projects will
be strengthened. In addition, lending operations (e.g., Philippine Rural Development Project) and trust
funds are being implemented that seek to increase productivity among rural as well as improve their
access to micro‐finance.
Through its agribusiness advisory on Sustainable Economic Development in Rural Philippines Program,
the International Finance Corporation (the private sector arm of the World Bank Group) seeks to create
equal opportunities for men and women involved in the agribusiness value chain. The IFC promotes the
inclusion of a gender perspective by producing and providing gender disaggregated evidence for policy
making; developing and providing tools and expertise to identify and unlock barriers to women’s
economic, social and political participation; sharing knowledge and experience on good practices; and
making gender visible and relevant in results measurement processes.
Engagement Area 4: Climate change, environment, disaster risk management: Addressing Climate
Change and Managing Disaster Risks: The Bank will pursue a policy review/dialogue on the gender
dimension of disaster risk management, the results of which will serve as basis for identifying further
engagement with the Government and other stakeholders on this matter. In addition, the scaling up of
CDD operations will integrate a stronger community‐based disaster response mechanism
Engagement Area 5: Peace, Institution Building, and Social and Economic Opportunity: Gender
dimension will continue to be mainstreamed in peace building or conflict management initiatives such

133

as the Mindanao Trust Fund. In addition, strategic adjustments will be adopted to strengthen the
gender dimension of CDD operations in conflict affected areas.
In pursuit of the aforementioned gender‐related lending and analytical agenda, the Bank will adopt the
following over‐arching strategies:
a) Strengthening gender analysis to inform new programs: The PH country team will ensure that 100
percent of its new lending programs are gender‐informed by end of FY17. For this purpose, the
country management team has assumed the responsibility for upstream review of the gender
dimensions of new proposals starting at the concept stage. Specifically, the PCN of new projects
should define the potential gender dimensions of a project or the process by which this would be
determined through broad consultation. At the project preparation stage, the Project Appraisal
Document shall ensure articulation of gender dimensions, particularly as part of the social
assessment. Whenever relevant, gender‐related measures shall be reflected in the results
framework, including key Core Sector Indicators. Related to this, the WB team shall continue to use
the NEDA harmonized guidelines for project development as one of the basic reference documents
in analyzing and determining the gender dimensions of a lending project. In addition, there are 4 on‐
going trust funds that are gender‐informed (i.e., MTF, KALAHI‐CIDSS AusAID Trust Fund, NPSBE,
NHSSP). The gender‐informed major non‐lending programs are targeted to increase from 50 percent
in FY14 to 85 percent by FY17.
b) Linking gender actions to monitoring: Under the current portfolio, there are seven lending projects
that will undertake evaluation or assessment of gender‐related outcome or results (please see
attached matrix for details). It is noteworthy that these evaluations/ assessments could potentially
provide policy options or strategic alternatives to address emerging gender‐related issues such as
maternal health, basic education, enterprise development for women and women’s participation in
community development. In addition to the assessments, it is targeted that 85 percent of new
projects will include gender‐related outcomes by way of using sex‐disaggregated key performance
indicators.
c) Supporting policy dialogues on emerging gender issues: Taking off from the results of the 2012
CGA, the Bank will continue to support policy dialogue on key gender‐related issues particularly
those that would contribute to the achievement of the CPS goals. For FY2014, policy dialogues
would focus on (i) teenage pregnancy which is one of the major causes of maternal and child
mortality; (ii) strengthening gender dimensions of disaster risk management; and (iii) improving
access of rural women to enterprise development.
d) Strengthening gender responsiveness of IFC interventions to ensure gender‐equal economic
opportunity. IFC will ensure that gender dimension is mainstreamed in its advisory services delivery
that will lead to equal economic opportunities for men and women involved in agribusiness value
chains. This will be accomplished through the following: (i) conduct of a gender analysis to
understand the issues and barriers that prevent equal access to economic opportunities, (ii)
ensuring that project design and implementation to address the issues and barriers that prevent
equal access to opportunities, and (iii) ensuring that gender‐disaggregated results measurement is
applied from baseline and through project monitoring and evaluation. Specifically, IFC’s programs
will capture women’s participation in trainings (output level measurement), their performance in
relation to small business management/financial literacy skills as a result of those trainings
(outcome level measurement) and their contribution to improved gross margin either as part of
farmer household or individually as a result of improved skills (impact level measurement).
