EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Political Developments. The National Resistance Movement, headed by Yoweri
Museveni, took power in 1986, bringing about a period of political and economic renewal.
Northern Uganda, however, suffered from two decades of war, until the Lord’s Resistance
Army was pushed out of Uganda in 2005. Uganda has progressed towards multi-party
democracy. President Museveni is likely to seek a fourth term in March 2011.
ii.
Economic Developments. Uganda has a record of prudent macroeconomic
management and structural reform. Despite various exogenous shocks, annual GDP growth
averaged 7 percent in the 1990s, and accelerated to over 8 percent from 2001 to 2008. Due to
high population growth, real GDP growth per capita averaged only 3.4 percent over the
1990s, and just over 4 percent over the 2000s.
iii.
Poverty, Human Development, and Demography. The poverty rate fell from 57
percent in FY93 to 31 percent in FY06, although there is substantial and growing urban-rural
and regional inequality. Uganda may reach at least two of the eight Millennium Development
Goals by 2015—the country is close to halving poverty and addressing gender inequality, and
has made progress towards many others.
iv.
Economic Prospects. Due partly to the global economic crisis, growth slowed in
FY09 and is expected to remain below potential in FY10-11. Beyond the crisis, GDP growth
is expected to remain robust, averaging about 7 percent from FY12 to FY14. Oil production
will change Uganda’s economic outlook, but full-scale production is unlikely to begin before
2016.
v.
Development Challenges. To sustain high growth and structurally transform the
economy, Uganda needs to address infrastructure bottlenecks, increase agricultural
productivity and value addition, reintegrate northern Uganda, manage urbanization, and
strengthen its human capital base. A rapidly growing population creates challenges for
employment and service delivery. An overarching challenge is to improve governance and
value for money, thereby enhancing service delivery and infrastructure investments, and to
build a clear and transparent institutional framework to ensure that future oil revenues benefit
the entire population.
vi.
Government Strategy. In February 2010, Uganda’s Cabinet approved a National
Development Plan (NDP) covering FY11-15. The NDP’s main theme is Growth,
Employment and Socio-Economic Transformation for Prosperity. The plan broadens the
country’s development strategy from poverty reduction to structural transformation to raise
growth and living standards.
vii.
Implementation of the World Bank’s Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS).
Executive Directors discussed the UJAS, the first joint multi-donor strategy of its kind, in
January 2006. The UJAS Completion Report rates Bank achievements under the UJAS as
moderately satisfactory. Lessons identified by the UJAS Completion Report and incorporated
into the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) are: (i) focus on fewer outcomes and ensure a
clear results framework; (ii) strengthen support to improve governance and help the
government identify and track governance indicators to guide governance interventions; (iii)
link Poverty Reduction Support Credit reforms to sector strategies supported by sector
operations; (iv) focus on developing on-the-ground mechanisms to improve aid coordination
and alignment with national priorities, rather than on joint strategic documents; and (v) at

project design stage, anticipate possible delays in credit effectiveness due to Uganda’s
lengthy approval process.
viii.
CAS Objectives and Results. The World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), aligned with Uganda’s NDP, will support structural transformation of the economy. It
provides a framework for World Bank Group support for five years (FY11-15). The CAS
focuses on four strategic objectives and eleven outcomes:

Promote Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth. There are four
outcomes: (i) improved conditions for private sector growth; (ii) improved
interconnectivity for regional integration; (iii) increased productivity and
commercialization of agriculture; and (iv) increased efficiency and sustainability of
natural resource management.
Enhance Public Infrastructure. There are four outcomes: (i) increased access to
electricity; (ii) improved access to and quality of roads; (iii) increased access to and
quality of water and sanitation services; and (iv) improved management and delivery
of urban services.
Strengthen Human Capital Development. There are two outcomes: (i) improved
access to and quality of primary and post-primary education; and (ii) strengthened
health care delivery.
Cross-cutting: Improve Good Governance and Value for Money. There is one
outcome: strengthened accountability and efficiency of public financial and human
resource management.
ix.
Proposed CAS Program. IDA resources under the FY011-15 CAS are estimated at
about SDR1.3 billion (US$1.97 billion equivalent). Development policy operations are
expected to account for about one-third of annual IDA financing, as was the case during
UJAS implementation. The Bank will prepare a CAS Progress Report in FY13, or earlier if
required, to update and adjust the CAS program as needed.
x.
Partnership. Development partners (DPs) in Uganda continue to seek ways to
further improve aid effectiveness. Recognizing the limitations of collective documents such
as the UJAS, DPs are focusing on basket funds, sector-wide approaches, and new
coordination mechanisms, such as the Joint Budget Support Framework. The Bank chairs the
Local Development Partners’ Group, the apex DP forum in Uganda.
xi.
Risks. Risks for CAS implementation include the upcoming presidential and
parliamentary elections; weak governance, especially in the context of future oil wealth; and
exogenous risks, such as weather, international prices, natural disasters, and insecurity in
neighboring countries. To mitigate risks, the CAS addresses inclusive growth and regional
integration; energy and transport (the binding constraints for growth); human development;
and governance and value for money.

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
FOR THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
I. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A. Political and Governance Context
1.
Uganda has the typical characteristics of a “bottom billion” country. It is landlocked and,
until recently, resource scarce, and neighboring countries are poor and many are prone to conflict.
Uganda is also ethnically diverse, which increases a country’s risk of divisions and conflict.1
2.
Following independence in 1962, the country experienced relative political and
economic stability until a 1971 military coup by Idi Amin Dada. Violence and mismanagement
reduced the country to a failed state with a collapsed economy. Political and economic turmoil
continued from 1979 to 1985, with successive coups and a disputed election in 1980 that led to
armed rebellions across the country.
3.
The National Resistance Movement (NRM), led by Yoweri Museveni, took power in
1986, beginning a sustained period of economic and political renewal. During its first decade in
power, the NRM focused on reconstructing the economy and establishing legitimate government.
The government advanced pro-market reforms and political liberalization. Despite being landlocked
and resource scarce, Uganda became one of the fastest growing countries in Africa. Donor assistance
in support of reform grew to 52 percent of the annual budget in the early 1990s.
4.
Northern Uganda is now secure; but it missed out on two decades of growth and poverty
reduction. The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) waged a brutal war that displaced 1.86 million people
and resulted in about 10,000 deaths. There have been no major security incidents since 2006;
economic activity is now resuming and most internally displaced people (about 1.3 million) have
returned to their villages. Pushed out of Uganda, the LRA now operates in the remote border area
between Southern Sudan, northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and the Central
African Republic. LRA leader Joseph Kony remains at large despite a 2005 International Criminal
Court warrant for his arrest on 33 charges, including crimes against humanity.
5.
There has been political stability and progress towards multi-party democracy. Uganda
has not yet, however, experienced a change of power through elections. Following the promulgation
of the 1995 constitution, non-party elections took place in 1996, providing President Museveni with
his first elected term after ten years in office. He was reelected in 2001. Constitutional amendments
approved by referendum in July 2005 introduced multi-partyism. At the same time the Uganda
Parliament voted to lift presidential term limits. Multi-party elections were held in 2006; and
President Museveni’s NRM Party won the election with 59 percent of the vote. President Museveni
is expected to seek a fourth term in March 2011.
6.
There is a perception of increasing corruption at all levels. Despite a strong anticorruption legal framework, Uganda has struggled to translate its anti-corruption laws into practice.
There have been four high-level corruption cases during the last two years, none of which has been

1

The 1995 Constitution of Uganda recognizes 56 indigenous peoples. However, according to the 2008 “State of
Uganda's Population Report,” about 70 percent of the country's 29.6 million people are from the eight largest tribes:
Baganda (south) with 17.3 percent; Banyankole (west) with 9.8 percent; Basoga (east) with 8.6 percent; Bakiga
(west) with 7.0 percent; Iteso (east) with 6.4 pecent; Langi (north) with 6.1 percent; Acholi (north) with 4.7 percent;
and Bagisu (east) with 4.6 percent.

fully resolved so far. Local public opinion polls indicate that petty corruption is widespread and
increasing. In addition, Uganda suffers from pervasive “quiet corruption”—the failure of public
servants to deliver goods or services paid for by governments—such as unchecked teacher and health
worker absenteeism.2 The perception of deteriorating governance is tarnishing Uganda’s image as a
development model.
7.
The recent discovery of oil brings both development opportunities and challenges.
Global experience demonstrates that natural resource wealth in the context of poverty and weak
institutions increases the probability of corruption, patronage, instability, and conflict. Whether
Uganda’s oil is a blessing or curse depends largely on the establishment of an institutional framework
that ensures fair and equitable distribution of resource rents and appropriate consideration of
economic, social, and environmental issues.
B. Economic Developments and Prospects
Economic Developments
8.
Over the past two decades, Uganda has established a strong record of prudent
macroeconomic management and structural reform. Uganda was one of the first Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) countries to embark on liberalization and pro-market policies in the late 1980s. Uganda
was also one of the first SSA countries to adopt a policy of decentralization. Through the 1990s, the
government maintained a stable macroeconomic environment and continued to undertake privatesector oriented reforms.
9.
By 2006, Uganda had graduated into a mature reformer.3 Annual gross domestic product
(GDP) growth rates averaged 7 percent in the 1990s and accelerated to more than 8 percent over the
seven years to 2007/08. However, due to rapid population growth, real GDP growth per capita
averaged only 3.4 percent in the 1990s and around 4 percent in the 2000s. (See Table 1; additional
economic data can be found in Annexes 2 and 3.)
10.
Macroeconomic stability and sound policies have helped sustain growth despite
exogenous shocks. Conflicts in neighboring DRC and Southern Sudan constrained regional trade.
Post-election unrest in Kenya in December 2007 resulted in temporary closure of the main trading
route to Mombasa, underscoring Uganda’s vulnerability as a landlocked country. Uganda has also
endured droughts, a severe energy crisis, and surges in food and oil prices.
11.
Private investment and exports have been important drivers of growth; both almost
trebled in real terms between FY01 and FY08. Private investments were mainly driven by
construction of commercial and residential property. The rise in exports was led by fish, tourism, and
oil re-exports (and, to a lesser extent, flowers, tobacco, and maize), rather than the traditional exports
of coffee, tea, and cotton. Primary agricultural commodities still account for more than 50 percent of
exports, and exports of food staples to the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda, and Southern Sudan have increased
in recent years.

2

A 2010 World Bank report titled "Silent and Lethal: How quiet corruption undermines Africa's development
efforts" contends that one of the main reasons behind Africa’s lagging economic development is poor service
delivery resulting from quiet corruption. Quiet corruption is less visible than big-time corruption but occurs across a
much wider set of transactions directly affecting a large number of beneficiaries and very often has deep long-term
consequences on households, farms, and firms.

In 2006, Uganda graduated to an International Monetary Fund non-lending Policy Support Instrument.

12.
The economy has undergone gradual structural transformation over the past two
decades, but at an increasingly slower pace.4 As share of total output, services increased from 32
percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2000 and to 52 percent in 2008. Industry as a share of total output
increased from 11 percent in 1990 to 23 percent in 2000, but then remained almost unchanged at 26
percent in 2008. Over the same period, agriculture as a share of total output decreased sharply from
57 percent in 1990 to 30 percent in 2000 and to 23 percent in 2008.
13.
Consistent with structural transformation, production is becoming spatially
concentrated. The agricultural potential of northern Uganda has not been exploited due to twenty
years of conflict. Higher value agricultural production is geographically concentrated in the southern,
central, and western areas of the country. Modern sector economic activity is also geographically
clustered around large towns and along transport corridors.
14.
The labor market transition has lagged the structural change of the economy, as
expected. Many economically active people are trapped in low productivity, low income activities
due to both a poorly educated and rapidly growing (3 percent per annum) labor force. Agriculture
and non-wage smaller enterprises employ the bulk of new entrants into the labor market.
15.
In recent years, the government has shifted public expenditures towards addressing
Uganda’s infrastructure constraints. The 2006 energy crisis, the deterioration of transport
infrastructure, and analytical work highlighting binding constraints to growth led to a scaling up of
infrastructure investments in the budget since FY 2008.
16.
Uganda’s tax-to-GDP ratio is the lowest among East Africa Community (EAC)
countries. Government revenue excluding grants amounted to 12.5 percent of GDP in FY 2009,
compared to the EAC average, excluding Uganda, of 17.8 percent. Efforts to boost tax receipts have
relied largely on improvements in revenue administration. The forthcoming introduction of a national
identification system may also help reduce tax evasion.

4

Structural transformation typically involves: a falling share of agriculture in GDP and employment, a rising share
of urban economic activity in industry and modern services, and migration of rural workers to urban settings.

-3-

17.
Uganda's economy was better positioned than many in Africa to weather the global
economic crisis; but the impact of the crisis has become more apparent. Initially, Uganda’s
economy showed resiliency due to strong fundamentals, prudent policies, comfortable reserves, and a
sound and well regulated financial system. Exports, remittances, and foreign direct investment began
to slow in late 2008, and the government responded with increased public investment expenditures as
a fiscal stimulus. In FY09, GDP growth fell to 7.1 percent, only slightly short of the projected 8.0
percent. However, the fiscal stimulus package was less effective than anticipated: public investment
expenditures fell substantially short of budget plans due to implementation constraints. 5 In FY10,
GDP growth is expected to fall to 5.6 percent.
18.
Uganda has taken further steps toward regional integration since signing the EAC
treaty in 1999. Uganda was a signatory to the EAC Customs Union launched in January 2005, which
aims to reduce non-tariff barriers and stimulate trade. An EAC Common Market protocol signed in
November 2009 will allow for the free movement of goods, people, and services, increasing
Uganda’s opportunities for regional trade and investment. Uganda has demonstrated its commitment
to EAC integration by reducing tariffs, harmonizing standards, and supporting the establishment of
the East African Legal Assembly. Uganda is also a member of the Common Market for East and
Southern Africa (COMESA). The EAC, COMESA, and the Southern Africa Development
Community are working to increase collaboration and launch a new East and Southern African Free
Trade Area.
19.
Since 1990, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) has improved the timeliness and
quality of its data. Uganda has today one of the most professional and transparent statistical offices
in Africa. With the support of the Bank and other development partners, UBOS is addressing its
remaining weaknesses, which include agricultural statistics and data on businesses. UBOS recently
completed an agricultural census, and will soon update its data on firms. During the CAS, the Bank
will provide technical support to UBOS, including to field and analyze a new series of panel multipurpose household surveys and prepare a new national statistics development plan.
Poverty, Human Development, and Demography
20.
Uganda’s high economic growth rates have enabled substantial poverty reduction. The
proportion of people living in poverty fell from 57 percent in FY93 to 31 percent in FY06. The
decline in poverty, particularly from 2002 to 2006, can be attributed to higher crop prices,
agricultural diversification, growth of non-wage non-farm employment (primarily household
enterprises), and the creation of new wage jobs in urban areas, particularly Kampala.
21.
However, there is substantial and growing urban-rural inequality and inequality
between regions. The national Gini coefficient rose from 0.35 percent in 1997 to 0.41 percent in
2006, in part because Uganda’s growth path has created opportunities in urban areas of the center and
west, while wide swaths in rural areas and the north and east were left behind. In particular, northern
Uganda has the highest rate of income poverty at nearly 60 percent, and poverty reduction in north
and north-eastern regions has only been marginal. The poverty headcount rate could have declined by
a further six percentage points if inequality hadn’t widened. The end of conflict in northern Uganda
provides opportunities for poverty reduction, although agricultural production has yet to reach levels
adequate to lift households out of poverty.

5

The Eighth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (US$120 million, FY11) will help address implementation and
absorptive capacity constraints, which in turn should allow the fiscal stimulus to be more effective. The Bank’s
analytical work, including the recent Roads PER, also provides advice to reduce implementation constraints.

22.
Uganda is expected to reach at least two of the eight Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by 2015 (see Box 1). The country is close on halving poverty and has made substantial
progress towards universal primary education and in addressing gender inequality. Uganda may even
achieve the targets for combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other communicable diseases ensuring
environmental sustainability; and developing global partnerships. MDGs on reducing child mortality
and improving maternal health are unlikely to be met. Uganda ranks 156 of 179 in the FY09 Human
Development Index of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The government, with
UN support, is preparing its third MDG Progress Report, ahead of the September 2010 UN summit.
Box 1: Uganda’s Prospects for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015
Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
Likely. Uganda has made steady and impressive progress on poverty eradication. The number of households living
in poverty has declined from 56 percent in 1992 to 44 percent in 1997, 38 percent in FY02, and 31 percent in FY06.
Uganda is expected to exceed the target of 28 percent by 2015. The proportion of underweight children under five
years fell from 25.5 percent in 1995 to 20.4 percent in 2006, but is still far from the target of 11.5 percent.
Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education
Possible. The introduction of UPE in 1997 led to a 132 percent increase in gross enrollment from 3 million children
in 1996 to 7.5 million in 2006. In FY08, Uganda recorded a net enrollment ratio of 93 percent (91 percent for girls,
95 percent for boys). However, completion rates are low at 52 percent (FY09). Drop out and repetition rates need to
be addressed or recent achievements will be reversed.
Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women
Likely. The ratio of girls to boys in primary (0.99), secondary (0.85) and tertiary (0.72) education institutions
indicate progress in achieving gender equality in education, as does the ratio of literate women to men age 15-24
(0.84). In the current parliament, 89 of the 310 members are women, representing 29 percent of the legislative body,
up from 18 percent in 1995.
Goal 4: Reduce child mortality
Highly unlikely. The infant mortality rate improved from 119 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1989 to 76 deaths in
2006 (compared to the MDG target of 31). The under-five mortality rate fell from 180 to 137 deaths per 1,000 live
births during the same period (compared to the MDG target of 56).
Goal 5: Improve maternal health
Highly unlikely. The maternal mortality rate stagnated at over 500 deaths per 100,000 live births between 1989 and
2000. The estimated maternal mortality is 435 deaths per 100,000 live births (2006) against the MDG target of 131.
On average, only 41 percent of all deliveries receive skilled attendance.
Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
Possible. By reducing prevalence rates from around 20 percent in 1990 to 7 percent in 2008, Uganda has already
achieved the MDG target for combating HIV/AIDS. Malaria remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
Uganda. As of 2003, there were 478 reported cases of malaria per 1,000 people. The MDG target for malaria could
be achieved if the anti-malarial interventions continue to expand as planned.
Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Possible. Uganda has made progress in increasing access to safe drinking water. Access to clean water has improved
to 65 percent against a target of 62 percent, but access to improved sanitation is only 68 percent against a target of
72 percent. There is persistent degradation of the country’s natural resources, including declining soil fertility;
deforestation; decreasing fish stocks; and water pollution caused by discharge from industries and domestic waste.
The forest cover in Uganda declined from 26 percent in 1990 to 18 percent by 2007. The proportion of titled land
remains 13 percent, versus an MDG target of 25 percent.
Note: Data based on most recent local sources, and therefore not fully consistent with data in Annex 2.

23.
The government has sought to expand access to social services, especially education.
Since the introduction of universal primary education (UPE) in 1997, net enrollment has increased to
about 92 percent for boys and girls, although completion rates remain low at 52 percent. In 2006,
Uganda launched a phased universal post-primary education and training program to absorb an
increasing number of primary education graduates and improve the low secondary enrollment rates
(27 percent in 2008). However, the Ministry of Education’s annual sector reviews and a draft
parliamentary report reviewing the government’s free education programs warn that increases in
enrollment are stressing existing school systems and facilities, negatively affecting educational
quality.
24.
Improvements in health care have been mixed. Malnutrition and maternal, child, and
infant mortality have improved, but remain unacceptably high: nearly one in seven children die
before age five; and one in five children under five years is underweight, down from one in four in
1995. Maternal mortality is among the highest in the world, linked to high fertility and poor pre- and
post-natal care. There are high human capital losses due to morbidity and mortality from largely
preventable and curable diseases and infections, such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis.
25.
Governance and capacity weaknesses hinder service delivery. Public expenditure reviews
(PERs) in education (FY08) and health (FY09) have revealed high inefficiencies and wastage of
public finances, particularly through high teacher and health care worker absenteeism rates and weak
drug procurement and supply management. Low actual spending of budget allocations suggests
challenges in complying with public financial management regulations, and there are frequent reports
of misuse of public funds. Basic social services are delivered by local governments; thus, weaknesses
in decentralization affect service delivery (see Box 2). There is a high administration burden at the
district level, with wages consuming a large and increasing share of total expenditures, leaving
insufficient funding for non-wage needs. The continued creation of new districts in Uganda is
expected to exacerbate this situation.
26.
Uganda’s population dynamics pose a challenge to development. It has the third highest
total fertility rate in the world (6.7 births per woman according to government data). Population has
doubled since 1988; and the median age is just above 15 years. Uganda is one of the few countries
where the number of young-age dependents exceeds (by 10 percent) the number of working age
individuals. This dependency rate makes it difficult to achieve sufficient per child investments in
health and education, and also lowers the country's savings rate. It will be a challenge for the
government to keep pace with the increasing demand for social services, let alone improve their
quality. The lower savings rate is likely to translate into a lower investment rate.
Medium-Term Prospects
27.
Partly as a result of the global economic crisis, real GDP growth is expected to increase only
slightly to about 6.4 percent in FY11. IDA Crisis Response Window resources (US$70 million) will
help the government maintain essential social expenditures, including for reproductive health.
28.
Uganda’s medium-term growth prospects remain solid. Services will continue to be the
main driver of growth, underpinned by sustained growth in communications and by growth in the
transport sector as infrastructure improves and regional trade expands. Uganda has a comparative
advantage in agriculture, which, if exploited, can contribute significantly to growth. Agricultural
production in the north is expected to increase and regional demand for Uganda’s exports,
particularly food, is likely to grow. As firms take advantage of the EAC, overall manufacturing,
particularly agro-based manufacturing, is expected to increase. Overall GDP growth is expected to
remain robust, averaging about 7 percent from FY12-14.
-6-

Box 2: Decentralization in Uganda
Uganda was one of the first countries in Africa to embark on decentralization. Local governments are
responsible for providing basic public services, such as primary education, primary health care, water and sanitation,
feeder roads, and agriculture extension services; and line ministries are responsible for policies, standards,
supervision, and oversight and training of local governments. There are three levels of local government: districts
and cities; municipalities and city divisions; and towns and sub-counties.
Policy reversals over the last five years are hindering service delivery and value for money:
 Near-elimination of local revenue base. Since the elimination in 2005 of the graduated tax, which provided
local governments with 5 percent of their total revenue and was important for discretionary expenditures, local
governments have become dependent on non-discretionary central government transfers for 98 percent of their
budget, reducing accountability to local citizens.
 Reduction in transfers to local government. Real per capita transfers from the central government to local
governments fell by 13 percent from FY03 to FY08. Transfers to local governments as a percentage of public
expenditure have declined from around 47 percent in FY02 to about 22 percent in FY09. Local governments are
spending an increasing proportion of resources on non-discretionary wages and salaries.
 Increased percentage of conditional grants. Tied sector conditional grants have increased as a percentage of
total transfers from central to local government, from 65.5 percent in FY06 to about 95 percent in FY10,
making it difficult for local government to plan for and respond to local demand and needs.
 Creation of new districts. More than 25 new districts were created from 2004 to 2009, bringing the total to 90.
The government continues to create new districts, purportedly to improve service delivery. In actuality, it
increases the amount spent on salaries and administration costs, further reducing resources available for service
delivery.
A possible new level of local government. A draft Regional Government Bill would create five regional
governments, which would be responsible for regional hospitals, secondary education, coordination, monitoring and
supervision of agriculture, and forest and land management.
Bank support to decentralization. The Bank is advising the government on the proposed regional governments
and on local government financing, including own-source revenue, the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system, and
possible borrowing. In addition, the Bank is supporting local government capacity building under the ongoing Local
Government Management Service Delivery project.

29.
Returning to and sustaining high per capita income growth in the medium and long
term will require acceleration of structural transformation. The economy would have to
transform from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture, from farm production to non-farm
production, and from domestic markets to external markets. Non-farm activities in construction,
trading, informal manufacturing, low-level agroprocessing, and retail services have provided sources
of diversification of income, but need to be sustained to absorb the fast-growing labor force.
30.
Accelerating structural transformation will require further addressing the
infrastructure gap, especially in the energy and transport sectors. Better transport is needed to
improve connectivity from producers to markets and to improve the mobility of the labor force; and
industry needs reliable electricity. Better municipal infrastructure is needed to accommodate
urbanization associated with structural transformation. The labor force will also need to be equipped
with skills that meet the demands of a changing economic structure.
31.
For public investments to succeed, governance and value for money need to improve.
Waste and corruption threaten to undermine the quality and effectiveness of infrastructure
investments and service delivery. Public investments are also facing constraints in absorption
capacity and implementation, derailing the pro-growth fiscal stance. Uganda needs to strengthen
capacity to plan and implement investments and build a culture of accountability, with an emphasis
on eliminating waste. The country has made progress in strengthening procurement and public
-7-

financial management (PFM) laws, systems, and regulations, but more work is needed to strengthen
compliance. Improving efficiency of public spending is particularly urgent in the context of future oil
revenues.
32.
Oil production will change Uganda’s economic outlook, although it is too early for
projections.6 Oil exploration companies have announced discoveries totaling at least 800 million
barrels of oil reserves, an amount comfortably above the threshold for commercial development.
Total basin potential is estimated at 2 billion barrels. Limited oil production could start as early as
2011 to be used for power generation. Full-scale production, which is not likely to begin before 2016,
could reach 150,000 barrels per day or more for ten to twenty years. Production at these levels would
generate revenues of over US$3 billion annually at today’s crude oil prices, of which more than half
would accrue to the government as royalties and taxes. At these levels, Uganda, while significantly
affected by oil, will not be totally dependent on oil revenues. Uganda would be in the company of
countries such as Azerbaijan, Sudan, and Trinidad & Tobago, as opposed to classic petro-states such
as Angola, Equatorial Guinea, and Nigeria. Although full-scale production is unlikely to be reached
during this CAS period, the multi-billion dollar capital investment projects needed to develop the oil
exploitation sector will impact the economy. (For more information on oil, see Box 3 and Annex 6.)
33.
The government is preparing the institutional environment for oil production and
revenue management, but much remains to be done. In January 2008, the government issued a
National Oil and Gas Policy, which articulates a best-practice framework for managing petroleum
resources for sustainable economic development. The policy calls for the establishment of several
new institutions and structures, including: a Directorate of Petroleum to set and monitor policy; a
Petroleum Authority to regulate the sector; a national oil company to hold the state’s direct
investment in oil projects; and a Petroleum Fund under the management of the Central Bank to
stabilize the revenue flow to the budget. The policy also calls for revising the petroleum law and
corresponding regulations to handle the development and production of oil and gas, appropriately
capture recent trends and best practice in the industry, and harmonize with a future revenue
management law. The government is in the process of producing enabling legislation.
34.
Oil brings opportunities and challenges. Oil production is likely to increase foreign direct
investment and domestic revenue and increase energy supply. But it may also bring inflationary
pressures, exchange rate appreciation, and new governance challenges. The so-called “Dutch
Disease” effect may reduce the competitiveness of Uganda’s agricultural exports and complicate the
country’s growth strategy, making value addition, export diversification, and manufacturing harder to
achieve. The National Oil and Gas Policy emphasizes that oil revenue will be used for strategic
public investments, which could help increase productivity in other sectors and offset Dutch Disease.

6

Given the uncertainty around timing and volume of oil production, the figures provided should be treated as
illustrations of the possible impact of oil, not as projections.

-8-

Box 3: Development of Oil Resources in Uganda
Oil Discoveries and Potential: Since 2006, UK-based Tullow Oil and its partner Heritage Oil have made a series of
large oil discoveries in the Lake Albert Rift Basin in western Uganda. Tullow Oil estimates the total oil discovered
at over 800 million barrels, and estimates total basin oil potential at 2 billion barrels.
This level of reserves would put Uganda into a peer group with Chad (0.9 billion barrels), Republic of Congo (1.9
billion), Equatorial Guinea (1.7 billion) and Gabon (3.2 billion), but far short of Angola (13.5 billion), and Nigeria
(36.2 billion).
Oil Revenue: Peak production is likely to be about 150,000 to 200,000 barrels per day for 10-20 years. Based on the
current fiscal system and assuming an oil price of US$75 per barrel, government revenue at peak production could
be over US$2 billion per year. By way of comparison, government revenue in 2008 was US$2.6 billion and GDP
was US$14 billion.
Timing: There is a high level of uncertainty regarding the time frame for reaching peak oil production and revenue
generation. Huge investments in infrastructure—estimated at US$10 billion—will be needed to produce, transport,
export, and refine the oil. Oil specialists estimate that peak production is likely to begin no earlier than 2016.
A first phase of limited production (perhaps 10,000 to 15,000 barrels per day) could begin in 2010-2012. Some
limited quantities of natural gas could also be produced for a 50 MW power plant. Nevertheless, government
revenue during this early production phase would be negligible.
Challenges: Development of Uganda’s oil will be complex for several reasons:
Oil characteristics: The oil is contained in low-pressure reservoirs, which will increase the complexity and cost
of production facilities. While light and low in sulphur, the oil has high paraffin content. Pipelines will need to be
heated for the oil to flow. Refineries will need expensive processing and treating capacity. Also, much of the oil
extends offshore under Lake Albert. While initial production will take place on land, future developments will
necessarily move offshore, resulting in increased cost, complexity, and environmental sensitivity. Some offshore
fields may be uneconomic to exploit.
Environment: Strict environmental protection requirements will be needed: oilfields are located in and around
Lake Albert and the Murchison Falls Conservation Area.
Production sharing contracts: Foreign investors hold their blocks by means of production sharing agreements
(PSAs) signed with the government between 1997 and 2005. Under the PSAs, the private investors bear the cost
and risk of exploration and development in exchange for a defined share of oil production in the case of success.
To date, the government has not disclosed the terms of the PSAs, leading to criticism from NGOs and others.
Local communities: Addressing local community issues and compensation will pose a challenge given Uganda’s
tradition of communal land ownership, unclear national land policy and regulation, and the possibility that
speculators will attempt to profit from changes in land values.
Transborder issues: Transborder issues with the DRC, such as allocation of resources, transport, security, and
environmental management, could give rise to difficult negotiations or even conflict given incomplete border
demarcation and a history of difficult relations between the two countries.
Pipeline and refinery development: Pipeline and refinery development: Exporting oil would require construction
of a 1,300 km export pipeline to an Indian Ocean port at a cost of some US$2-3 billion. A large domestic refinery
would have a similar cost. Under either the export or refining option, forming the investment consortium and
concluding the necessary commercial and financing agreements will be a complicated and time consuming
process. Construction time for either the pipeline or the refinery would be roughly three years.
Bank Support: Given the many uncertainties at this stage regarding petroleum sector development, the Bank
program will be necessarily flexible. All Bank analytical work under the CAS will take into consideration petroleum
sector issues. Annual policy notes on the petroleum sector will provide just-in-time advice to the government on key
topics. The Bank and government are discussing a possible Petroleum Sector Support Project (FY12). The Bank will
provide further support during the CAS period as requested by the government and as more information becomes
available on petroleum sector developments.

Debt Sustainability
35.
Uganda’s risk of debt distress is low, according to a recent update (March 2010) of the
Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis. Its debt ratios have improved substantially
due to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative and to
prudent macroeconomic management. The government plans to only gradually increase use of nonconcessional borrowing to finance public infrastructure investments as they build debt management
capacity. The analysis indicates that debt sustainability is sensitive to shocks, such as deterioration of
economic growth. To minimize risk, the government needs to carefully select and implement public
investment projects to accelerate economic growth at reasonable fiscal costs. The next Joint IMFWorld Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis is planned for March 2011.
C. Key Development Challenges
36.
Accelerating structural transformation. The country’s uninterrupted growth since 1987
has been a noteworthy achievement. However, the weak point of economic performance has been the
limited shift from a low-productivity, primary-based economy to a high-productivity economy based
on industry and services. The country’s high population growth rate makes structural transformation
particularly urgent to create nonagricultural and higher-productivity jobs for one of the fastest
growing labor forces in the world.
37.
Alleviating infrastructure and other bottlenecks. Inadequate infrastructure, especially
transport and energy, is Uganda’s binding constraint for growth and economic transformation. The
government needs to identify and facilitate implementation of infrastructure projects that will induce
private sector investment in new products, resulting in increased exports and new jobs. Also, the
financial sector needs to deepen and contribute more to growth. Lending as a share of deposits
remains low. Pension reform is needed to create longer-term private investment financing.
38.
Raising agricultural productivity and value addition. The government needs to continue
supporting technology adoption to reduce the gap between yields achieved in farm trials and average
national yields, and also improve value chain linkages through promoting agro-processing and public
private partnerships. It is increasingly recognized that other core public functions, such as animal and
plant disease control, regulatory services, water for agricultural production, sector statistics, and
monitoring and evaluation, require support to ensure enduring agricultural growth.
39.
Managing urbanization for growth. The pace of Uganda’s structural transformation will
also depend on the efficiency of its spatial transformation. Although Uganda’s current level of
urbanization is low, the rate of urban growth is high—estimated at 5.9 percent annually. Further
agglomerations of people and economic activity will accompany structural transformation. Uganda
has an opportunity to proactively strengthen decentralization and urban management to maximize the
economic opportunities inherent in urbanization.
40.
Reintegrating the North. Spurring economic recovery in northern Uganda is important for
growth and poverty reduction, as well as for political stability. Development challenges in the north
are acute: the region has the highest incidence of female-headed households in the country at 31
percent; and the infant mortality rate was 106 per 1,000 live births in 2006, compared to the national
average of 76. Yet, northern Uganda has high potential for agricultural production and exports, given
its proximity to markets in the DRC and southern Sudan. Ongoing investments in infrastructure and
improvements in service delivery coordinated through the government’s Northern Uganda Peace
Recovery and Development Plan and the Karamoja Integrated Disarmament and Development Plan
will help harness this potential.
- 10 -

41.
Addressing the demographic challenge. Uganda could generate a demographic dividend
for economic growth by accelerating the transition from high to low fertility and mortality rates.7 To
achieve this, Uganda would need to improve its policies to reduce fertility and child and infant
mortality and increase access to and quality of education, especially for girls.
42.
Addressing the youth challenge. Nearly 400,000 youth enter the labor force each year; and
their absorption into the labor market will remain a challenge for the medium term. To assist youth
transition to stable employment, it will be important to raise the primary completion rate to near 100
percent, improve employment opportunities in the wage sector, and support youth in their transition
to employment in the non-wage sector. (See Annex 7 for a full discussion on the youth challenge.)
43.
Arresting environmental degradation and natural resource depletion. Despite efforts to
improve institutions for environmental management and sustainable use of natural resources, the
depletion of Uganda's natural resources and degradation of the environment is constraining growth.
There is a high level of deforestation, while household expenditures for charcoal and fuelwood,
principal sources of energy, have doubled during the last 15 years. Fishery resources, an important
export, are declining. Other renewable natural resources—water resources, wetlands, grasslands,
farmlands, and biodiversity—are being similarly depleted. Climate change will further challenge
natural resource management.
44.
Addressing a weakening governance environment. Uganda improved the quality of
governance in the early part of the decade by strengthening accountability sector institutions,
introducing decentralization, and accelerating public sector and public financial management reform.
However, despite considerable transparency and a strong anti-corruption legal framework,
accountability and enforcement are low. According to a 2009 Africa Peer Review Mechanism
Country Review of Uganda, petty and high-level corruption are prevalent and affect every institution
in the country, and are most rife in procurement, privatization, administration of revenues and public
expenditures, and public service delivery. Despite the government’s zero tolerance policy on
corruption, few if any high-level officials involved in major corruption scandals have been tried,
hindering attempts to raise the bar and address lower level corruption. Reinvigorating institutions and
accountability systems, rethinking decentralization policies, in particular fiscal aspects, and relaunching stalled public service reform processes will be essential elements for the development
agenda in the coming years, especially before oil revenues come on stream.
45.
Avoiding the so-called “resource curse.” Uganda’s overriding development challenge is to
manage its oil endowment for stability, prosperity, and sustainability. Success will depend largely on
the government’s near-term policy decisions, especially regarding resource management, revenue
management, and environmental management. Effective petroleum sector governance requires the
establishment of a clear and transparent legal, regulatory, and policy framework. The government
must also manage public expectations regarding the future benefits coming from oil production and
take steps to assure that the oil-affected communities feel the development benefits of oil.

7

When the fertility rate falls and the youth dependency ratios declines, the workforce becomes relatively larger,
opening a window for faster human capital development and economic growth—known as the demographic
dividend.

II. GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND DEVELOPMENT PARTNER SUPPORT
A. Uganda’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
46.
Uganda was the first country to prepare a comprehensive, participatory, and countryowned national development strategy in 1997, creating the model for the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper. The 1997 Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) received international praise. It
was revised and updated in 2000 (PEAP II) and 2004 (PEAP III). PEAP III was extended for two
years, to June 2010, due to delays in preparing its successor.
47.
In February 2010, the government finalized a new five-year (FY2011-2015) National
Development Plan (NDP). The NDP’s main theme is “Growth, Employment and Socio-Economic
Transformation for Prosperity,” marking a broadening of the country’s development strategy from
poverty reduction, the focus of the PEAPs, to structural transformation to raise growth and living
standards. It is the first in a series of six plans intended to transform Uganda over thirty years into a
modern and prosperous country.
48.
The NDP has eight objectives. These are: (i) increase household income and promote
equity; (ii) enhance the availability and quality of gainful employment; (iii) enhance human capital
development; (iv) improve the stock and quality of economic infrastructure; (v) increase access to
quality social services, (vi) promote science, technology, innovation, and information and
communications technology (ICT) to enhance competitiveness; (vii) strengthen good governance,
defense, and security; and (viii) promote sustainable population and use of the environment and
natural resources. In addition, the NDP identifies four priority areas for investment: infrastructure
development; human resource development; critical production inputs; and science, technology, and
innovation. The NDP identifies fifteen “national flagship projects” intended to address binding
constraints to growth.
49.
The NDP includes analysis of cross-cutting issues crucial to sustained growth, such as
gender. It highlights gender inequalities, commits to mainstreaming gender-responsive development,
and proposes strategies to address gender gaps (see Box 4). Other cross-cutting issues include:
governance, urbanization and decentralization, climate change, and regional cooperation. The NDP
also includes a detailed discussion by sector, including a situational analysis, constraints, objectives,
and planned interventions.
50.
The IDA-IMF Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) considers both the macroeconomic
framework and the sector-specific plans to be generally compatible with the government’s
vision of structurally transforming the economy. The JSAN also notes that weak governance and
exogenous shocks could affect implementation adversely. The JSAN recommends measures to
strengthen the NDP and enhance its implementation, such as better prioritization; actions to make
growth more inclusive; preserving space for private sector initiatives and strengthening the legal and
fiscal framework for public-private partnerships (PPPs); and including indicators of improving public
financial management and governance in the NDP monitoring and evaluation plan.

- 12 -

Box 4: Gender Inequality in Uganda
Uganda’s constitution guarantees gender equality and includes a number of affirmative action measures; however, as
noted in Uganda’s National Development Plan (NDP), gender perceptions and practices continue to perpetuate
inequalities that hinder economic development. The NDP introduces a comprehensive framework for mainstreaming
gender-responsive development within the country’s objectives. It is informed by the National Gender Policy (2007)
and the National Action Plan on Women.
Based on the NDP’s gender analysis and the World Bank’s “Gender and Growth Assessment for Uganda” (2005),
the key gender-based barriers to economic growth and poverty reduction are:
 Women are marginalized in business ownership, skills development, access to financial resources, nonagricultural employment, and inheritance rights.
 There is a marked gender gap in access to and control over productive resources. Women comprise 70 percent of
the work force in agriculture but have unequal access to and control over productive resources, such as land,
limiting their ability to move beyond subsistence agriculture.
 Women have lower access to health and education services. There are gender disparities in primary school
completion as well as secondary school enrollment. Only a third of girls enrolled in primary education continue
in school to the age of 18, compared to half of boys
 Early marriages and low girl primary school completion and secondary school enrollment are principal
contributors to a high fertility rate and a high maternal mortality rate.
During the CAS period, Bank-financed operations will be designed to reflect differences in men’s and women’s
needs and constraints to ensure equal participation and equitable distribution of benefits. The CAS includes specific
interventions to address gender inequalities in business skill development, education, health care, and agricultural
production. The CAS results framework includes gender-disaggregated indicators in these areas.

NDP Objectives 1 and 2: Income, Equity, and Employment
51.
The NDP identifies eight primary growth sectors—agriculture, forestry, manufacturing,
oil and gas, tourism, mining, ICT, and construction. The NDP calls for using national resources,
better infrastructure, and development projects to ensure that all regions benefit from the growth of
the national economy.
52.
The private sector is constrained mainly by poor infrastructure and difficulty in
accessing credit. The NDP notes that “Doing Business 2010” ranks Uganda 112th out of 183
countries. To improve conditions for private sector growth, the NDP calls for improving economic
infrastructure, enhancing human capital development, strengthening competitiveness, and improving
the private sector regulatory framework.
53.
The NDP acknowledges agriculture as a key sector for growth, exports, employment,
and food security. It provides the basis for growth in other sectors such as manufacturing and
services. The NDP focuses on boosting agricultural production and productivity by increasing
agroprocessing and strengthening policies and institutions.
NDP Objective 4: Economic Infrastructure
54.
Recognizing that weak infrastructure is a binding constraint for trade and growth, the
NDP gives priority to improving infrastructure, especially energy and transport. The road
sector carries 96 percent of total cargo freight, but only 4 percent is paved. Railways carry only 3.5
percent of freight cargo and only 28 percent of it is functional. Only 11 percent of the population has
access to electricity. The NDP identifies several flagship projects to address these gaps, including
- 13 -

railway construction and rehabilitation, development of Kampala rapid transport systems,
improvement of water transport on Lake Victoria, and construction of new hydropower plants.
55.
The NDP also emphasizes the need to increase access to water for production. It notes
the potential negative impact of climate change on agricultural yields. The construction of five largescale irrigation systems is a national flagship project.
NDP Objectives 3 and 5: Human Capital Development and Access to Social Services
56.
While some progress has been made in recent years, Uganda’s health outcomes remain
poor, even in comparison to other SSA countries. The health sector suffers from inadequate
funding, understaffed health centers, health worker absenteeism, and waste in drug supply. The NDP
emphasizes preventive and curative care, while exploring synergies with other sectors, such as
education and water and sanitation, to reduce preventable diseases. It also focuses on addressing
performance gaps by tackling health care systems and management, strengthening human resource
planning, ensuring availability of drugs, and expanding access to Uganda’s National Minimum
Health Care Package.
57.
Education has been a priority since 1997, when the government introduced universal
primary education. The government launched a phased universal post-primary education and
training program in 2006, and has launched reforms to address quality. Nevertheless, widespread
absenteeism, inequitable teacher deployment, insufficient spread of instructional materials, and weak
governance structures at the school levels hinder the quality of service delivery.
58.
The NDP also identifies skills development as a priority. The NDP notes the rapidly
growing labor force and the high level of drop-outs from primary and secondary schools. In response,
the government intends to develop a national vocational program.
NDP Objective 6: Science, Technology, Innovation, and ICT
59.
The NDP recognizes the role of science, technology, and innovation in growth and
socioeconomic transformation. The NDP calls for the establishment of regional centers to adapt
and promote new technology and provision of incentives to the private sector to encourage
innovation. The government plans to improve ICT infrastructure by extending the national fiberoptic network to all districts and by introducing e-government services, including e-procurement.
NDP Objective 7: Good Governance, Defense, and Security
60.
The NDP identifies the weak public sector as a major constraint to development.
Institutional inefficiency and ineffectiveness resulting from poor planning and management and
limited staffing lead to low absorption of public funds and poor delivery of services. The NDP also
recognizes the devastating socio-economic effects of corruption. It notes that Uganda is ranked 130th
out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s 2009 Corruption Perception Index, below many
other African countries.
61.
The NDP identifies a number of key actions to address institutional weaknesses and
governance challenges. This includes using the NDP as a key document to ensure alignment with all
sectors plans, improve policy coordination, introduce institutional performance contracts at all levels,
improve human resource management of public servants, review pay and incentives systems, and
improve coordination and cooperation with the private sector and civil society. The NDP aims to
- 14 -

increase transparency and accountability by introducing value for money performance standards and
performance budgeting in all sectors.
NDP Objective 8: Promote Sustainable Population and Use of Environment and Natural
Resources
62.
The NDP recognizes that current population trends pose challenges to future growth
and structural transformation unless actions are taken to generate a population dividend. It
notes that high fertility results from low levels of education, early child bearing, a low contraceptive
prevalence rate of 24 percent, and a high unmet demand for family planning estimated at 41 percent.
The NDP identifies several key areas for intervention: implementation of the national population
policy (including mobilization of resources); increasing access to and availability of family planning
and reproductive health care; and increasing enrollment of youth and adults in education and training
programs to increase the availability of skilled labor.
63.
Uganda’s natural resources and biodiversity are deteriorating due to population
pressures and economic activity. The country has the sixth highest deforestation rate among 62
tropical countries—losing one quarter of its forests from 1990 to 2005. Fish production fell by 14
percent from 2004 to 2007, and biodiversity is declining. By 2017, Uganda could be a water stressed
country. Recognizing the productivity effects on agriculture, industry, and fisheries, the NDP calls
for restoring degraded ecosystems, ensuring sustainable management of environmental resources,
increasing public awareness, and enforcing environmental laws and regulations.
B. Development Partner Support
64.
Uganda is highly dependent on development assistance. Official Development Assistance
(ODA) increased from US$192 million in 1986 to US$1.7 billion in 2007.8 Relative to GDP, total
ODA to Uganda stood at 5 percent in 1986, peaked at 25 percent in 1992, and averaged 14 percent
from 2004 to 2008. On-budget donor support amounted in FY08 and FY09 to about US$800 million
per year; thus, donors finance around 30 percent of the government’s budget.
65.
More than 40 bilateral and multilateral development partners (DPs) provide aid to
Uganda; but only three DPs account for almost half of total ODA. The World Bank, the single
largest financier, accounted for 19 percent of the US$7.3 billion disbursed from 2004 to 2008. The
United States accounted for 18 percent; and the European Commission accounted for 10 percent. The
number of small donors creates a challenge for lowering the transaction costs of donor assistance: 12
DPs accounted for 90 percent of ODA over the period; while 30 DPs accounted for the remaining 10
percent.
66.
There have been efforts since the 1990s to improve donor harmonization. The
government and DPs signed a set of Partnership Principles in 2003, which emphasized the
government’s preference to use budget support as an aid modality. Over the last decade, in line with
government preferences, DPs have shifted increasingly from project support to budget and sector
support. In 2007, 66 percent of disbursed aid was provided as either general budget support or within
program-based approaches, up from 50 percent in 2005.

8

ODA is measured by donors as expenditures that have as their main objective the promotion of the economic
development and welfare of developing countries. What is classified as ODA to Uganda will not equal the amount
received by the Government of Uganda.

- 15 -

67.
In 2005, seven DPs joined together to elaborate a Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy
(UJAS) to support the government’s 2004 PEAP. Five additional DPs joined the UJAS framework
in 2006, bringing the total number of UJAS partners to twelve.9 It was the first joint assistance
strategy of its kind, representing a commitment among DPs to improve harmonization and aid
effectiveness.
68.
A review of the UJAS concluded that transaction costs were not reduced.10 The
development of a joint assistance strategy was well intended, but in retrospect was neither a
necessary nor sufficient condition for more effective aid. For example, while the UJAS outlined joint
development partner commitments and aspirations to work more effectively towards the achievement
of the PEAP goals and objectives, the UJAS was not effective as an operational tool during
implementation. Consequently, UJAS partners and other DPs decided to engage with government on
the development of on-the-ground mechanisms to improve aid coordination and alignment with
national priorities, rather than on developing joint strategic documents.

9

The initial seven UJAS partners comprised: the African Development Bank, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the World Bank Group. Five DPs signed up to the UJAS in 2006: Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and the European Commission.

partners and other DPs.

III. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UGANDA JOINT ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND LESSONS LEARNED
69.
World Bank Executive Directors discussed the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy
(UJAS) in January 2006 (Report number 34310-UG). Part 1 of the UJAS covered a joint DP
assessment and strategy, and Part 2 covered the World Bank Group assistance program.
70.
The UJAS adopted the five pillars of Uganda’s 2004 Poverty Eradication Action Plan
(PEAP). These were: (i) economic management, with a focus on macroeconomic stability consistent
with rapid private sector-led growth; (ii) enhancing production, competitiveness, and incomes; (iii)
security, conflict resolution, and disaster management; (iv) good governance; and (v) human
development. Within these five pillars, the UJAS identified 15 high-level strategic objectives, 40
outcomes, and 56 outcome indicators.
71.
The UJAS Completion Report rates Bank achievements under the UJAS as moderately
satisfactory. Pillar 1 (economic management) and pillar 3 (security, conflict resolution, and disaster
management) were rated satisfactory; while pillar 2 (enhancing production, competitiveness, and
incomes) and pillar 5 (human development) were rated moderately satisfactory. Pillar 4 (good
governance) was rated moderately unsatisfactory. A Country Assistance Evaluation by the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rated World Bank support during the period 2000-2007
(covering the FY01-03 CAS and the first two years of the UJAS) as moderately satisfactory (see Box
5). In 2008, the Bank contracted a client survey to provide information on perceptions of the Bank’s
work in Uganda, which revealed that most stakeholders surveyed would like the Bank to focus on
infrastructure and play a leading role in fighting corruption (see Box 6). See Annex 19 for the full
UJAS Completion Report.
Box 5: Uganda Joint Country Assistance Evaluation, 2001-2007
The World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and the Operations Evaluation Department of the African
Development Bank produced a Joint Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) dated March 19, 2009, covering the
period 2000 to 2007, corresponding to the FY01-03 CAS and the first two years of the UJAS.
IEG Findings. World Bank programs were substantially effective in decentralization, public sector reform, growth
and economic transformation, education, and water and sanitation. IEG deemed that more could have been done to
help counter the perception of increasing corruption, improve power supply, reduce transport costs, enhance
agricultural productivity, and help with family planning and reproductive health. The CAE rated the overall
outcome of World Bank support as moderately satisfactory.
IEG Recommendations and Corresponding Country Team Actions:
(i) Support the government in developing an analytical framework to guide governance reforms. Action: The Bank
and DPs are developing a Data Tracking Mechanism.
(ii) Encourage and support government efforts to develop medium-to-long term master plans for infrastructure.
Action: The Bank has supported a Power Sector Investment Plan; a National Transport Master Plan, including a
Transport Master Plan for Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area; and a 15-year investment plan (2008 - 2023) for
all modes of transport. The Bank will also support a Rural Electrification Strategy.
(iii) Encourage the government to coordinate ongoing monitoring and evaluation initiatives by its development
partners to ensure reliable monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of its overall poverty reduction strategy. Action:
The government, whose PEAP evaluation identified weak and uncoordinated M&E as a factor hindering policy
evaluation and decision making, is drafting a national policy on public sector M&E to address legislative gaps,
clarify roles and responsibilities, and enforce institutional accountability for service delivery.
(iv) Reinforce the effectiveness of general budget support as an instrument for minimizing transaction costs and
facilitating the use of country systems. Action: The Bank and DPs have developed a Joint Budget Support
Framework.

Box 6: Client Survey
Methodology. From May to July 2008, about 550 stakeholders of the World Bank in Uganda were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country. 306 stakeholders (56%) responded to the survey.
Survey results:
 Respondents across most stakeholder groups and all geographic locations believed that the Bank considered its
top priority in Uganda to be ensuring macroeconomic stability consistent with rapid growth.
 Respondents indicated that it would be most productive for the Bank to focus most of its resources on
strengthening basic infrastructure.
 Respondents felt that the Bank should play a leading role in fighting corruption (mean response rating of 5.2 on a
6-point scale, where 1 is “not at all” and 6 is to “a great degree”).
 The majority of respondents felt that the Bank should be more involved in Uganda’s development strategies; 20%
felt that the Bank is currently involved at an optimum level. Only 8% of respondents felt that the Bank should be
less involved or should not be involved at all.
 Respondents felt that the Bank’s policy and economic advice and financial resources were its greatest values. The
Bank’s lending when others won’t, donor coordination, knowledge, and technical advice were also considered of
great value.
 Respondents felt that the Bank’s greatest weaknesses in its work in Uganda were imposing theoretical and
technocratic solutions without regard to political and other realities and being too bureaucratic in its operational
policies and procedures
 Across all respondents, the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Uganda received a mean rating of 6.3 on a 10-point
scale, with 1 being very unfavorable and 10 being very favorable. Ratings were highest from employees of
ministries (7.0), local government (7.2), and other organizations (7.4) and lowest from nongovernmental
organizations (4.9).

IDA, Trust Funds, and Analytical and Advisory Activities
72.
World Bank Executive Directors approved about US$1.3 billion in IDA during the
UJAS period (FY06-09) for seventeen operations. Budget support operations (Poverty Reduction
Support Credits) amounted to US$460 million—35 percent of total lending.11
73.
In terms of net commitments, the Uganda portfolio is the sixth largest in the Africa
Region. As of end January 2010, there are sixteen IDA-financed operations with a net commitment
amount of US$1.3 billion. In addition, there are five regional projects and an IDA guarantee of
US$115 million for the Private Power Generation (Bujagali) Project.
74.
The current sector distribution of IDA commitments reflects the government’s
emphasis on infrastructure. About 68 percent of commitments are allocated to energy, mining,
environment, urban development, and transport. About 22 percent are allocated to education and
social development; 8 percent to finance and private sector development; and 1 percent to economic
and public sector management.12 (Annex 8 provides a summary of the Operations Portfolio.)
75.
Overall, project implementation performance has been satisfactory. The portfolio
disbursement rate is 28.5 percent, versus the Africa Region average of 18.5 percent. There are one

11

The three PRSCs were: PRSC-5 in FY06; PRSC-6 in FY07; and PRSC-7 in FY08, which also provided funding
for FY09 under an exceptional two-tranche design to align the PRSP with the Joint Budget Support Framework.
12
Uganda is currently in between PRSC cycles. When there is a PRSC in the active portfolio, the allocation to
economic and public sector manager increases to about 9 percent.

- 18 -

potential and two actual problem projects, resulting in commitments at risk of 4.9 percent, much less
than the Africa Region average of 28 percent.13 IEG project ratings of projects exiting the portfolio
have been largely consistent with Implementation Completion Report ratings. However, delays in
IDA credit effectiveness caused by Uganda’s lengthy approval process have often resulted in cost
overruns and project delays.14 Of the seventeen projects under implementation at the start of FY09,
six had effectiveness delays of 200 days or more. On average, effectiveness took 185 days. (Annex 9
provides selected indicators of the Bank portfolio.)
76.
Uganda benefitted during the UJAS from 48 trust funds providing nearly US$65 million
in grants. Most were linked to lending operations. They focused mainly on: environment (GEF);
renewable energy (GEF); demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants (MDTF); avian
influenza; sanitation and hygiene (WSP); monitoring and evaluation (IDF); and piloting output-based
aid in health and water supply (GPOBA). (A list of active trust funds is shown in Annex 10.)
77.
The Bank’s analytical and advisory activities (AAAs) underpinned investment
operations and sector strategies, and informed the government’s reform path. Analytical work
included the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, FY07), which helped the government shift
toward investments to accelerate economic growth and structural transformation. The CEM was
followed by a strategically planned series of public expenditure reviews (PERs), focusing on
education (FY08), health (FY09), and roads (FY10). The report “Public Finance Management in
Uganda – a Platform Approach” (2008), including an assessment of fiscal decentralization and the
PEFA Report (FY09) has informed the public finance management reform agenda. Other AAA
includes: a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, an Investment Climate Assessment, a Financial
Sector Study, a Land Poverty and Social Impact Assessment, an Agriculture Sector PER, and a study
on Regional Inequality.
78.
A recent Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) identified portfolio issues and
actions to improve portfolio performance and disbursements. The CPPR, which concluded in
February 2010, recommended actions to improve quality at entry; build project implementation
capacity, especially procurement; reduce effectiveness delays; and increase attention to
environmental and social safeguard issues. The full CPPR Action Plan is shown in Annex 11. A
CPPR Progress Report is planned for September 2010.
The International Finance Corporation
79.
IFC investment commitments over the CAS period (FY 2006-2009) amounted to
US$201 million for eleven projects. Investments were mainly in the electricity sector (US$155
million) and the financial sector, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and
telecommunications. Since 2006, the IFC has focused on intermediaries for SME finance, resulting in
improved portfolio performance with negligible loss reserves. Currently, the portfolio amounts to
US$193 million, the fourth largest country portfolio for IFC in Africa (see Annex 12 for additional
details). IFC initiated 14 advisory projects during the period with a total value of US$7.6 million. In
many cases, these advisory projects complemented investments to broaden development impact, for
example supporting distributor networks and the Village Phone model with cell phone operators;
working with banks to build capacity for SME lending, including facilities targeting women

13

Actual project projects have Project Development Objective (PDO) or Implementation Progress (IP) ratings of
moderately unsatisfactory or lower. Potential problem projects are those with PDO or IP ratings of moderately
satisfactory or higher, but have three or more risk flags.
14
Under Ugandan law, parliament approves each loan or credit.

entrepreneurs, and expanding housing finance. Other areas included assistance to improve the
investment climate, address constraints for businesswomen, promote foreign investment, and develop
models for private participation in small-scale rural water and electricity provision. Uganda also
benefited from IFC’s advisory work to structure the private concession for Kenya Railways, which
was extended to incorporate Uganda Railways in a single concession.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
80.
During the UJAS period, MIGA became increasingly involved in Bank group energy
projects. MIGA is supporting Globeleq Holdings (United Kingdom) with a US$41 million guarantee
of its investment in Umeme Ltd, the project company that has leased the electricity distribution grid
of Uganda for 20 years. MIGA is also supporting Sithe Global (USA) with a US$115 million
guarantee of its equity in Bujagali Energy Ltd. MIGA has a third guarantee in support of
agribusiness. In all, MIGA’s portfolio of three guarantees has a combined gross exposure of US$158
million.
Lessons Learned
81.
The CAS Completion Report identified the following key lessons, which are
incorporated in this CAS:
(i) Focus on fewer outcomes and ensure a clear results framework. Typical of many earlygeneration results-focused CASes, the UJAS included an unrealistic number of outcomes
(40) and indicators (56), which reduced the Bank’s strategic focus and ability to track its own
effectiveness. In addition, both the UJAS and the PEAP had weak and incomplete results
frameworks.
(ii) Strengthen support to improve governance and help the government identify and track
governance indicators to guide governance interventions. Focus on country-specific
actionable governance indicators rather than on perception-based and cross-country
comparative indicators.
(iii) PRSC reforms should be linked to sector strategies and specific sector operations. Longterm sector reforms are best tackled when addressed simultaneously by a development policy
operation and a sector specific operation.
(iv) Focus on developing on-the-ground mechanisms to improve aid coordination and
alignment with national priorities, rather than on joint strategic documents. The
development of a joint assistance strategy was well intended, but it did not increase aid
effectiveness nor reduce transaction costs for the government or DPs.
(v) Anticipate at the project design stage the possibility of delays in credit effectiveness, due
to delays in Uganda’s approval process. In addition, the Bank should ensure that
government informs parliament about proposed projects at the appraisal stage, and puts in
place a mechanism to track the approval process.

- 20 -

IV. THE WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
82.
The CAS aims to support Uganda’s vision of structural transformation by selectively
assisting the government in implementing the NDP. The CAS provides a framework for World
Bank Group support to Uganda over five years, from FY11-15, in alignment with the five-year NDP.
A. The Framework for World Bank Engagement in Uganda
83.
Align with national priorities. The CAS supports the implementation of the NDP and
relevant sector strategies and regional strategies, such as the Northern Uganda Peace Recovery and
Development Plan and the Karamoja Integrated Disarmament and Development Plan. CAS outcomes
are a subset of NDP outcomes, focusing on areas where Bank interventions will contribute
measurably to NDP outcomes. The Bank considered the views of a range of stakeholders during CAS
preparation (see Annex 13, summarizing CAS consultations).
84.
Maintain flexibility to mitigate risks. The first twelve months of CAS implementation will
take place within a pre-election environment with inherent uncertainties and governance risks (see
Section VI: Risks and Mitigation). The recent discovery of oil further increases political and
governance risks. A CAS Progress Report will be prepared in FY13, or earlier if required, to update
and adjust the CAS program as needed.
85.
Continue to improve donor harmonization and reduce transaction costs for the
government. Development partners in Uganda continue to seek ways to further improve aid
effectiveness. Recognizing the limitations of the UJAS, DPs are focusing on basket funds, sectorwide approaches, and new coordination mechanisms, such as the Joint Budget Support Framework
(see also Box 7), rather than on collective documents.
86.
Strengthen strategic partnerships. The Bank will complement its core program by
establishing strategic partnerships through single- and multi-donor trust funds and co-financing
arrangements. This will enable the Bank to leverage its own resources and capacity for greater
impact on the ground.
87.
Enhance World Bank Group cooperation. The electricity sector is an example of close
collaboration between IDA, IFC, and MIGA. IDA worked to restructure the sector and establish the
framework for private participation; IFC helped to structure the Private Power Generation (Bujagali)
Project, and IDA, IFC, and MIGA financing instruments were combined to realize the financing.
The three Bank Group entities also provide joint support to the electricity distribution company,
Umeme. During the CAS period, the World Bank Group will further enhance collaboration focusing
on three areas: infrastructure (energy and transport); private sector development and business
environment; and commercialization of agriculture.
88.
Enhance regional integration. The number of regional projects has increased from one
project in FY01 to an expected six projects by the end of FY10, reflecting an increasing emphasis on
regional integration that will continue under the CAS. The proposed CAS program includes regional
analytical work and projects to help Uganda increase growth through regional integration.
89.
Strengthen institutional capacity. Lending operations will include components as needed to
build or strengthen institutional capacity, including joint analytical work with local think tanks,
research centers, and academia (such as the Economic Policy Research Center, Makerere University)
to both support and strengthen them. Through an Institutional Development Fund grant (FY10,
- 21 -

US$500,000), the Bank will also support the Diaspora Division within the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, which aims to use Uganda’s diaspora to build institutional capacity in energy, roads, and
railways.
90.
Strengthen attention to governance and value for money. Given its cross-cutting nature,
governance and value for money is addressed under various CAS outcomes. A Governance
Partnership Facility (GPF) Window 1 grant (US$1.48 million) will help intensify attention to
governance and anti-corruption (GAC) under this CAS. A Governance Risk Assessment Matrix,
which summarizes risks, opportunities, gaps, and planned actions, will be monitored during the CAS
(see Annex 14). A core Bank governance team in the Uganda Country Office will meet periodically
to assess GAC initiatives and adjust them as needed. GAC initiatives to be undertaken during the
CAS include: 15
(i) Enhance the focus on governance in sector projects, using them as entry points. The
Bank will undertake political economy analysis and sector GAC assessments to design
customized approaches to addressing governance risks that impede outcomes. During FY10,
a GPF Window 2 grant was used to undertake political economy studies of the health and
agriculture sectors, and a GAC assessment of the health and roads sectors. The analyses
informed sector dialogue, were integrated into project design, and were used to prepare
Governance and Anti-corruption Action Plans (GAAPs) that were adopted by the
corresponding ministries. A GPF Window 1 grant provides funds to continue this approach
during the CAS period, including for energy (in the context of oil exploitation) and local
government/decentralization (in the context of moves towards recentralization and increased
challenges to effective service delivery). GAAPs will be reassessed after one year of
implementation.
(ii) Continue to build demand-side mechanisms into project design. Five out of the sixteen
ongoing IDA-financed investment projects already include demand-side mechanisms, such as
citizen report cards. Demand-side mechanisms will be used during the CAS period whenever
feasible. In addition, the Bank will test third-party monitoring of project implementation and
results by a civil society organization.
(iii) Increase transparency and disclosure of project activities to encourage citizen
monitoring. In response to views expressed at CAS consultations, the Bank will increase
public communication to ensure that project beneficiaries have access to information about
budgets, contracts, and expected results. The Bank will initiate this approach with selected
operations: Agriculture Technology and Agribusiness Advisory Services; Health Systems
Strengthening; and Northern Uganda Social Action Fund II.
(iv) Launch a Data Tracking Mechanism (DTM)—a GAC monitoring tool using actionable
and country-specific indicators. The DTM was designed to use national data, such as
reports of the Auditor General, the Inspector General, and the Budget Monitoring Unit.
During a workshop in April 2010, government and DPs agreed to use the DTM to track
corruption trends. The DTM will be managed by an independent research institute.
91.
Mainstream gender within CAS outcomes. The CAS addresses gender concerns identified
in the NDP, focusing on four areas: agriculture, girls’ education, private sector, and reproductive
health, which are captured in the CAS Results Framework.

15

The Bank’s Country Team discussed GAC initiatives at a Governance Workshop in Kampala in December 2009.

B. IDA Resources
92.
IDA resources under the FY11-15 CAS are estimated at about SDR1.3 billion (US$1.97
billion equivalent). The CAS covers the last year of IDA15 (FY11), the three years of IDA16
(FY12-14), and the first year of IDA 17 (FY15). Uganda’s indicative IDA allocation in FY11 (before
front-or back-loading in FY09-10) is SDR 252 million (about US$385 million equivalent). Given an
expected slight back-loading of IDA resources in FY10, the available resource in FY11 is estimated
to be SDR256 million (US$390 million equivalent). An estimated average annual allocation of about
SDR 252 million (US$385 million equivalent) would also be available during each year in FY12FY15, assuming that the IDA 16 and 17 replenishments will provide as much IDA resources as the
IDA 15 replenishment. The estimates for FY11-15 are indicative only and can change depending on:
(i) total IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s performance rating; (iii) the number of IDA
eligible countries; (iv) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA-eligible countries; and (v)
the terms of IDA’s assistance to Uganda (grants or credits), which are determined annually and based
on the risk of debt distress. IDA allocations are made in SDRs based on performance, and the US$
equivalent is dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate. Uganda could also potentially access
IBRD for enclave projects, such as rehabilitation and expansion of the railway network.
93.
The government can increase its IDA allocation by improving its Country Performance
Rating, as measured by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and a
portfolio performance rating. Uganda performs better than average for IDA countries (and the
Africa region) on economic management (macroeconomic, fiscal, budget, and structural
management). However, Uganda performs average or below average on service delivery, public
sector management, efficiency of revenue mobilization, quality of public administration, and
transparency, accountability and corruption.
C. CAS Outcomes and the Proposed Program of Support
94.
To support the NDP, the CAS will focus on three strategic objectives, one cross-cutting
objective, and eleven outcomes. The relationship between CAS strategic objectives and outcomes is
shown in Figure 1.
CAS Instruments
95.
Analytical and advisory activities. AAA will include: core diagnostic economic and sector
work (ESW); ESW to underpin lending; and technical assistance (TA) and just-in-time policy notes
as requested. As done effectively under the UJAS, the Bank will use AAA to expose development
bottlenecks. The Bank will also use AAA to underpin its enhanced engagement on governance
issues. There will be increased emphasis on results-based AAA and on dissemination of ESW to
generate political debate and stimulate demand for more efficiency. In undertaking AAA, the Bank
will emphasize government ownership and donor partnership to ensure that findings are translated
into actions and results. A tentative AAA pipeline is shown in Table 2 and Annex 15). A CAS
Progress Report (FY13) will identify AAA for FY 2013-15.
96.
IDA-financed operations. To achieve CAS outcomes, the World Bank will finance
investment operations, adjustable program loans (APLs), development policy operations, regional
operations, and additional financing to scale up successful interventions. A tentative lending pipeline
is shown in Table 3 and Annex 16. IDA lending by CAS objective is shown in Annex 17. A CAS
Progress Report will define the IDA portfolio for FY 2013-15 based on an updated analysis of needs
and priorities.

Budget support. Development policy operations are expected to account for about one third
of IDA financing under this CAS, as was the case under the UJAS.16 PRSC-8, which is planned for
early FY11, is the start of a new PRSC series within a Joint Budget Support Framework (see Box
7).17 The new series, PRSCs 8-11, will focus on improving efficiency and value for money in the
delivery of core public services, recognizing that strengthened accountability and efficiency of public
spending is critical for the effective utilization of future oil revenues. To this end, the PRSCs will
support (i) effective delivery of healthcare, education, water supply and sanitation, and road
construction and maintenance; and (ii) complementary reforms in procurement, budget planning and
execution, public sector management, public financial management, and decentralization. The
PRSCs will build on recent public expenditure reviews, which identified binding constraints to
service delivery.
98.
Trust Funds. Continuing the trend under the UJAS, trust funds are expected to grow in both
volume and strategic importance during the CAS period. Two recently-approved trust funds provide
cross-cutting support to NDP and CAS outcomes: a US$1.48 million grant for recipient-executed

16

The volume and nature of budget support will be reassessed, as needed, during the CAS period within the JBSF.
PRSC-8 was originally planned for Board delivery in late FY10, but has been shifted to FY11 due to delays in a
prior action involving amendments to the procurement law.

activities under the Governance Partnership Facility will be utilized to enhance the focus on
governance during the CAS period; and a US$12 million programmatic trust fund financed by the
United Kingdom’s (UK’s) Department for International Development (DFID) will support the
government’s implementation of the NDP. A third, multi-donor trust fund, is being established to
undertake analytical activities related to the Joint Budget Support Framework (JBSF), thereby
informing the dialogue with the government and providing a platform for harmonized DP positions.
In addition, trust funds will provide cofinancing for Bank operations, such as the Northern Uganda
Social Action Fund II and the Transport Sector Development Project. Trust funds, such as Global
Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) and the Netherlands Trust Fund Africa Renewable
Energy Access Program, will also help pilot innovative approaches that can be scaled up under IDAfinanced operations. The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) will continue supporting sanitation
and improving service delivery to the poor in urban areas.

Box 7: A New Joint Budget Support Framework
The government and development partners (DPs) approved, for the first time, a Joint Budget Support Framework
(JBSF) in October 2009, to reduce the transaction costs of budget support for the government, increase the
predictability of disbursements, and create a stronger and more consistent policy dialogue that fosters mutual
accountability in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
JBSF partners. There are 12 JBSF partners, three multilateral DPs (the African Development Bank, European
Commission, World Bank), and nine bilateral DPs (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom). JBSF partners combined are expected to disburse over
US$300 million per year, with the Bank accounting for about one third of the total.
JBSF governance structure. It is two tiered:
 A DP Policy Committee meets regularly and engages with the government at an annual high-level forum;
 At the working level, the JBSF Technical and Policy Dialogue Taskforce meets frequently to coordinate the
design and implementation of the JBSF and conduct an annual assessment of performance.
A multi-donor trust fund managed by the Bank will be used to establish a Technical and Administrative Support
Unit, to provide administrative support and generate high-quality technical and analytical work.
Joint Assessment Framework (JAF). The JAF is developed and agreed by the government and JBSF DPs, and is
used by DPs to assess the government’s performance in agreed areas. The assessment of performance will form
the basis for DPs’ disbursement decisions. The JBSF also ensures timely disbursement by DPs.

D. Strategic Objective One: Promote Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth
99.
The Bank will focus on four outcomes to promote inclusive and sustainable growth. To
improve conditions for the private sector, the Bank will support government efforts to improve land
registry, streamline regulations, and deepen the financial sector. The Bank will also help Uganda
maximize the benefits of regional integration, including by decreasing non-tariff barriers, such as
transit time through the northern corridor. Bank support will help farmers adopt new technologies to
increase yields and the share of production marketed, with outreach to female farmers to increase
their access to advisory services. To address the sustainability of growth, the Bank will support
improved land use management, reforestation, and promulgation of environmental regulations
relating to oil and gas policy.
CAS Outcome 1.1: Improved conditions for private sector growth
100. Analytical underpinnings. An Investment Climate Assessment (FY09) based on a 2006
survey pointed to lack of electricity and cost and unavailability of financing as key business
constraints. The Bank’s “Making Finance Work for Uganda” (FY09) explored issues relating to
access to finance and development of term finance, highlighting the need for pension sector reform.
Under the CAS, the Bank’s policy dialogue will support financial sector and pension system reforms
to improve access to financial services, and the preparation and implementation of a financial market
strategy. The Bank and IMF plan to undertake a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in
FY11 or FY12. A study on “Youth Transition to Work” (FY12) will use updated panel data and new
quantitative data to analyze constraints faced by youth in making the transition to work and identify
effective approaches to address these constraints, paying special attention to gender and post-conflict
issues.
101. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The ongoing Second Private Sector
Competitiveness Project (PSCP II, FY05) aims to improve enterprise growth (including outreach to
women entrepreneurs), business registration and licensing procedures, transparency and efficiency of
land registry (including lowering the time it takes to register property), and access to financial
services; and it supports the establishment of the Kampala Industrial Business Park. Under the
- 27 -

CAS, additional financing (US$20 million, FY11) may be used to scale up the land registry
component; and a planned PSCP III (US$50 million, FY13) will finance activities to increase
tourism, youth employment, and exports of nontraditional commodities.
102. Expected results of regional operations. The Bank and the EAC Secretariat are discussing a
first and second EAC Financial Sector Regionalization Project (EAC FSRP I, FY11, covering the
first year; EAC FSRP II, FY12, covering years two through six) to establish a single market in
financial services among EAC members, following up on the signature of the EAC Common Market
Protocol in November 2009.
103. Expected results from trust funds. Trust funds will be used for targeted support linked to
project outcomes. A grant from the DFID Trust Fund for NDP Support will help the government
establish a new pension system regulatory framework, including a new Uganda Retirement Benefit
Authority. A grant from the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility is financing technical
support for the establishment of a PPP unit. The DFID Trust Fund may also be used to prepare a
detailed work program for the new PPP unit and build its capacity, and to develop a more focused
private sector competitiveness strategy and a system to monitor investment climate and doing
business indicators.
104. IFC. IFC has provided lines of credit and advisory services to commercial banks for onlending to SMEs, with a focus on expanding access to credit for women entrepreneurs, and has
undertaken an advisory program to develop mortgage lending. In support of PSCP II, IFC is
providing assistance on investment promotion and an investment climate reform program that covers
licensing, regulatory reform, business taxation, and other areas tracked in the Doing Business
indicators. IFC will assist viable investments in the Kampala Industrial and Business Park.
105. MIGA. During the CAS period, there will likely be opportunities for MIGA to support
foreign direct investment in the agribusiness, manufacturing, services, and energy sectors. Projects
will be supported on an as-needed basis. Given the typical size of transactions in these sectors,
MIGA would likely support some of these projects under its Small Investor Program (SIP). At
MIGA, SIP projects have individual (gross) exposures of less than US$10 million and are normally
approved in less than two months given their streamlined procedures.
106. Development partners. DPs coordinate their activities through a Private Sector
Development Working Group co-chaired by the Bank. DPs supporting private sector development
include: the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), DFID, the European
Commission (EC), the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), Ireland, Norway, and the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
CAS Outcome 1.2: Improved interconnectivity for regional integration
107. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank recently launched “Regional Integration, Trade and
Growth in the Great Lakes Region of Africa” (FY11), financed mainly by a grant from the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade, to produce policy notes on measures to facilitate trade and increase
future growth.
108. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The ongoing East Africa Trade and
Transport Facilitation Project (FY06) finances the construction of one-stop border posts between
Uganda and Kenya and Uganda and Rwanda, which is expected to reduce the transit time through the
Northern Corridor from Mombasa to Kigali. The project also supports the concessioning of the
Mombasa to Kampala railway to a private operator and the preparation of a feasibility study to
- 28 -

upgrade the Tororo–Pakwach line. The project will be restructured and may require additional
financing. The Bank and IFC plan to work jointly with the EAC and the African Development Bank
(AfDB) to help formulate regional regulatory and legal frameworks to facilitate sound railway
operations. When a comprehensive railway plan for the EAC is completed, the World Bank Group
could advise on prioritization and financing, including possible use of IBRD funds in addition to use
of IDA resources and other World Bank Group resources. A proposed East Africa Transport Links
(US$25 million for Uganda, FY12) will help improve Lake Victoria transit. Uganda is expected to
join the Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (RCIP) (FY12, US$70 million, of which
US$30 million from Uganda’s IDA allocation), which will provide funding for ICT infrastructure
and various e-government activities to lower the cost of communications and improve transparency
and efficiency of government services.
109. IFC. The Rift Valley Railways (RVR) line from Kampala to Mombasa was privatized in
2006 with advisory assistance from IFC. Two 25-year concessions were signed by the Governments
of Kenya and Uganda and IFC subsequently provided loans to the concessionaire. However, owing
to ongoing problems with RVR management and performance, IFC loans were not fully disbursed.
IFC has worked to ensure the success of the concession, with the introduction of a new sponsor
group which will inject additional equity and bring onboard experienced rail operators as managers.
Once the restructuring is finalized, IFC will continue its financial support to the railways under the
existing project, with MIGA willing to consider guaranteeing the equity investment. In
telecommunications, IFC is supporting the East African Submarine Cable System to connect East
African countries to the rest of the world via high bandwidth fiber optic cable.
110. MIGA. As part of its commitment to Africa's regional integration agenda, MIGA may be
asked to provide guarantee support for the Kenya/Uganda railway, depending upon the pace of
ongoing commercial negotiations. IFC and the Bank are already supporting this project with loans
and guarantees, respectively, thus MIGA is working closely with both to ensure effective coverage.
111. Development partners. In the ICT sector, the Government of China is financing the
development of the national ICT backbone network, the first phase of which was completed in 2008
although it is still not fully operational. The second phase is under implementation.
CAS Outcome 1.3: Increased productivity and commercialization of agriculture
112. Analytical underpinnings. The Sustainable Land Management PER (FY08) and the
Agriculture PER (FY09) informed the Development Strategy and Investment Program (DSIP) of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry, and Fisheries. Following agreement on the DSIP,
government and DPs signed the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program
(CAADP) compact in March 2010. The DSIP provides the strategic framework for the Bank’s future
lending. During the CAS, the Inclusive Growth ESW (FY11) will identify constraints to agricultural
commercialization and inclusive agricultural growth. Once agricultural census results are available
(FY13), the Bank will undertake additional AAA to inform lending and the policy dialogue. TA on
water for agricultural production will be undertaken during the CAS period (FY13).
113. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The Agriculture Technology and
Agribusiness Advisory Services Project (ATAAS, US$120 million, FY10), building on the Second
Agricultural Research and Training Project, which closed in June 2009, and the National Agricultural
Advisory Service Project (NAADS), which closed in December 2009, will lead to increased
agricultural yields and shares of farm production marketed. The ongoing Northern Uganda Social
Action Fund II will complement ATAAS by helping IDP returnees and other vulnerable groups in
northern Uganda re-start agricultural activity and become eligible for advisory services. The Bank and
- 29 -

government are discussing a new project (US$50 million, FY14) to address other priority areas for
public investment identified in the DSIP, which could include irrigation, animal health, pest control,
food safety, and quality assurance.
114. Expected results from trust funds. The ATAAS will be supplemented by a US$7.2 million
GEF grant to promote sustainable land management and help respond to climate change. In addition,
a DFID Trust Fund grant of about US$1 million will provide TA for DSIP implementation.
115. Regional integration. In FY10, Uganda joined the East Africa Agricultural Productivity
Project (US$30 million), which focuses on the regional aspects of agricultural research and
technology promotion, complementing the ATAAS.
116. IFC. The Bank and IFC will work together to identify actions to promote more rapid
commercialization of agriculture. Potential joint activities include: (i) input production (investments
in domestic/regional fertilizer production, support to seed companies and agro-input providers, PPPs
for provision of key inputs and services, and support to private sector investors on irrigation); (ii)
output marketing (support to outgrowers and PPPs for storage facilities); (iii) processing/value
addition (support for agri-business and expansion of PPPs in value chains); and (iv) exports
(investments in exporters and support related to infrastructure, trade finance, and logistics/handling
infrastructure).
117. Development partners. An Agriculture Sector Working Group plays a strong role in
coordinating support for the agriculture sector, aligned with the CAADP. Both the ATAAS and the
proposed Agriculture Sector Support Project are envisaged to be funded through a “basket fund”
using a SWAp approach with other active DPs in the sector. Three DPs will together provide about
US$41 million to the ATAAS basket: DANIDA (US$7 million), EC (EUR 15 million), and the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD, US$14 million). In addition, DANIDA and
USAID provide substantial off-budget support for commercializing agriculture.
118. Governance/value for money. GAC-related risks of ATAAS are high, given charges of
misuse of funds under NAADS. Consequently, the government and IDA have designed ATAAS to
strengthen management, enhance accountability, and minimize corruption risks. ATAAS includes a
Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plan. The Agriculture PER (FY09) included a value for
money analysis that also informed the design of ATAAS.
CAS Outcome 1.4: Increased efficiency and sustainability of natural resource management
119. Analytical underpinnings. Oil and gas: The Bank will prepare just-in-time policy notes
(FY11, FY12, FY13) on petroleum-related subjects and the experiences of other countries, which
could include: fiscal federalism; establishment of a petroleum training center; oil production in
environmentally sensitive areas; and development programs for local communities in oil-affected
areas. Water resources: The Bank and the government are preparing a Country Water Resources
Assistance Strategy (FY11) to identify entry points for Bank engagement in the water sector to
reduce existing water-related vulnerability of the economy and enhance the positive impact of water
on growth and poverty reduction. Follow-on TA during the CAS period will include support to the
government for advancing its Water Strategy and Investment Planning (FY13), and mainstreaming
climate resilience in water resources planning and management (FY14), building on earlier Bank
work on water and climate change. Environment: A study on environment and growth—as a standalone ESW or to be included in the Inclusive Growth ESW (FY11)—will help identify
environmental and natural resource management priorities as a basis for informing a possible Bank
investment aimed at protecting and conserving natural resources including forestry.
- 30 -

120. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The broad-based Environmental
Management and Capacity Building II (EMCBP II, FY01) helps establish the institutional and legal
framework for national and local-level environmental management. Additional financing (FY09) is
supporting afforestation, improved municipal solid waste, and the establishment of environmental
standards for oil and gas exploration and production. The ongoing Sustainable Management of
Mineral Resources Project (SMMRP, FY04) and additional financing (FY09) strengthens
government capacity to manage the sector responsibly, supports artisanal and small-scale mining
communities, and lays the foundation for future investment through high tech geological mapping
and a modern transparent mining rights system. Based on the findings of the Country Water
Resources Assistance Strategy and the government’s Water Resources Assessment and Strategy, the
Bank and government plan to prepare a Water Sector Development and Management Project
(US$130 million, FY13) to invest in strategic urban water supply and sanitation systems (see para.
140) and help the government operationalize water management zones. The Bank and the
government are discussing possible IDA support for the petroleum sector, which could include
support for towns and municipalities in the petroleum-affected area.
121.
Carbon-finance operations. Uganda has developed about a dozen Clean Development
Mechanism projects that bring global resources to mitigate climate change and support local
sustainable development priorities. Uganda was one of the pioneering countries to develop a project
with the Prototype Carbon Fund with the West Nile Electricity Project. Another carbon operation
involves the management and composting of waste in several small, growing cities across the
country. Uganda is also implementing a highly replicable community-based timber replanting
project. Carbon resources can also help projects that use biomass co-generation to generate heat and
electricity to supply the nation's electricity grid using renewable resources, such as bagasse
generation from sugar mills.
122. Regional integration. Given the transboundary nature of Uganda’s water resources, there are
numerous regional activities under the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP)
and the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), in which Uganda has been involved for ten years. Work under
the second phase of LVEMP (US$27.5 million to Uganda) includes strengthening institutional
capacity for water and fisheries management, point source pollution control and prevention, and
watershed management in the Katoga river catchment.
123. Development partners. The Bank works with a number of sector working groups on various
natural resource management issues, including the Environment Sector Working Group and the
Water Sector Working Group. The Bank has proposed the establishment of a Petroleum Sector
Working Group to improve the flow of information and ensure harmonized DP support. Norway, the
lead DP in the petroleum sector, is implementing a three-year US$15 million program based on three
pillars: resource management, revenue management, and environmental management. The IMF is
also providing support on petroleum revenue management; and the AfDB is providing support on
infrastructure. The UN is currently developing a joint program on climate change.
124. Governance. The SMMRP is improving minerals sector governance by building institutional
capacity and implementing a new mining cadastre system. There is now revenue transparency at the
local level though publication of the share of royalty income to local governments. Revenue
transparency at the macro level has been agreed to in principle but Uganda has not yet embraced the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process as a means to achieve this. EITI would
also provide a multi-stakeholder forum for more effective dialogue with civil society on both mining
and oil revenues and sector concerns.

- 31 -

Box 8: Climate Change in Uganda
Impact on Uganda: Uganda’s exposure to climate change risk is moderate. Models by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change predict Uganda to get wetter and hotter. Climate change risks are associated mainly with
increased frequency and severity of floods and droughts, and associated natural disasters, such as landslides, erratic
rain and weather patterns, and spread of malaria to higher elevations due to increase in temperature.
The CAS will take a two-pronged approach to climate change: Consistent with the Africa Region Climate
Change Strategy, the CAS will support actions that make Uganda’s economy more resilient to climate risks. Actions
will comprise: (i) mainstreaming of adaptation to climatic changes in sector operations in key productive sectors;
and (ii) targeted interventions for priority adaptation or mitigation issues (for example, in forestry or climate resilient
infrastructure in Kampala). In addition, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery is financing
regional technical assistance (Climate Observations and Regional Modeling in Support of Climate Risk
Management and Sustainable Development Country: Eastern Africa) to help countries, including Uganda, better
prepare in managing risks associated with climate change.
Adaptation: Adaptation will be mainstreamed through sector operations, including agriculture, transport, municipal
infrastructure, and water resource and watershed management.
Mitigation: Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions will target one of the most significant sources of greenhouse
gas emissions in Uganda—deforestation and forest degradation—and will be implemented through a forestry or
natural resource management operation and through support for renewable energy.
Coordination and technical assistance: An overwhelming number of donor initiatives on climate change and
limited capacity of sector ministries to respond to climate change require both strengthened donor coordination and
targeted technical assistance to the government. Both will be supported through the DFID Trust Fund for NDP
Support and draw on recent work by GTZ to map climate actors in Uganda. The DFID Trust Fund for NDP Support
and Country Environmental Analysis trust fund may also support studies on economic impacts of climate change
and environmental degradation on Uganda to inform targeting of the investment interventions. In addition, the
Uganda Water Resources Assistance Strategy will study climate change risks to water resources.

E. Strategic Objective Two: Enhance Public Infrastructure
125. The Bank will support Uganda’s effort to address its most binding constraint to
growth—poor infrastructure. CAS interventions in the energy sector aim to reduce unmet demand
for electricity and increase the rural population’s access to electricity, including through renewable
energy. The CAS program also aims to increase the percentage of national roads in good condition,
while rehabilitating key corridors that will help reintegrate northern Uganda and facilitate trade with
neighboring countries; and it aims to increase the rural population’s access to all-season roads.
Expected results in the water sector include increasing the percentage of the population with access
to an improved water source, and the percentage of households with access to safe and effective
sanitation. The Bank will provide support to strengthen institutions and improve infrastructure and
services in cities and towns to facilitate spatial agglomeration needed for structural transformation.
CAS Outcome 2.1: Increased access to electricity
126. Analytical underpinnings. The government has pursued rural electrification in accordance
with the Rural Electrification Framework (2001-2010). The government will prepare a new Rural
Electrification Strategy (2011-2010) to accelerate access to electricity from the current low level. The
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and the Bank will collaborate on a diagnostic study
(possibly financed by the DFID Trust Fund for NDP Support) to inform the new Rural Electrification
Strategy.
127. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. There is substantial World Bank Group
support for energy, exceeding US$700 million including guarantees, which will continue under the
CAS. The 250 megawatt Bujagali hydropower station, supported by IFC, MIGA, and an IDA Partial
- 32 -

Risk Guarantee (PRG), is expected to be commissioned in April 2012. The ongoing Energy for Rural
Transformation Program APL II (US$75 million IDA, US$8 million GEF, FY09), is part of a threephase APL to expand rural electricity access from the current less than 5 percent to 10 percent
(400,000 new connections) by 2015 in addition to supporting the development of at least 40
megawatts of renewable energy. The ongoing Power Sector Development Operation (US$300
million, FY07) is supporting short-term investments (emergency thermal generation and energy
efficiency activities) to overcome power generation shortfalls and financing gaps so as to stabilize
the sector in addition to sector policy changes needed to promote its sustained future expansion. An
ongoing component of the Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project (US$5.5 million IDA
PRG, FY01) supports the concession of electricity distribution to Umeme.
128. The proposed Electricity Sector Development Project (US$90 million, FY11) will increase
electricity supply by financing improvements to the transmission grid system. Additional power
sector support (US$100 million) is programmed in FY12. The Energy for Rural Transformation
Program APL III (US$40 million, FY14) will focus on implementing the new Rural Electrification
Strategy to increase access to electricity and build necessary institutional capacity. Additional funds
for ERT III may be leveraged from other DPs to increase the program’s scope. In addition, during the
CAS period, the government may request World Bank Group support for one of the major
hydropower projects identified as part of government long term sector strategy and cited as national
flagship projects in the NDP.
129. Expected results from trust funds. The Energy Sector Multidonor Assistance Program
(ESMAP) will support Uganda’s efforts to identify geothermal resources and prepare feasibility
studies where possible. Under the Energy for Rural Transformation APL II, IDA and GPOBA funds
will be used for an OBA scheme to increase energy access to poor households in rural and peri-urban
areas. As part of the Netherlands Trust Fund for the Africa Renewable Energy Access Program, the
Biomass Energy Initiative for Africa will finance two pilot projects in Uganda, one involving
production of air-controlled top lit updraft stoves by local tinsmiths, and another to use fish waste to
produce electricity for a local community. Finally, a Russian Energy for Small and Medium
Enterprises Trust Fund is financing studies to assess barriers to private sector initiatives in the
development of renewable energy.
130. IFC. In addition to the ongoing support to the Bujagali project, IFC has provided a US$25
million loan to Umeme, the private electricity distribution company, to improve the quality of its
service and connect up to 20,000 new customers annually. The IFC loan contributes to Umeme’s
US$50 million investment program for 2009 and 2010, which will enable Umeme to upgrade its
existing equipment and provide new electricity connections. The company currently supplies
power to over 300,000 customers.
131. MIGA. MIGA plans to continue supporting as needed its two guarantees in the energy
sector: the Bujagali project guarantee and a US$41 million political risk guarantee to Umeme. Given
MIGA’s upstream involvement in the sector and contacts with the energy investor community, it is
likely that MIGA will be asked during the CAS period to provide additional cover for the Umeme
project as well as cover for new power generation projects. MIGA is, in principle, prepared to extend
additional guarantees, given the chronic power shortages in the country and the low rate of access to
electricity.
132. Regional integration. The emerging East Africa Power Market offers a long-term
opportunity for least cost power in eastern Africa. AfDB and JICA are financing electricity grid
interconnections between Uganda-Rwanda and Uganda-Kenya. A planned East Africa Power Pool
- 33 -

Project will support the development of the newly established Power Pool and further strengthen the
backbone lines in Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda. In addition, the Nile Basin Initiative trust
fund is financing feasibility studies for the Uganda-DRC and Uganda-Sudan transmission lines.
Subject to the feasibility study recommendations, the regional program may support construction of
the Uganda-DRC line.
133. Development partners. The key players in the sector include: the Norwegian Agency for
Development Cooperation (NORAD), the German Reconstruction Credit Institute (KfW), Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and AfDB – and have provided financing towards
generation, transmission network development in addition to rural electrification and technical
assistance and capacity building activities. To enhance the cooperation among the development
partners and joint support to the sector, the Bank under the ongoing Power Sector Development
Operation is supporting the set up and operation of the Energy Sector Working Group led by the
Ministry of Energy and Minerals Development. The major objectives of the Sector Working Group
are to: align the work within the energy and mineral development sector more closely with national
priorities, and strengthen the cross-sectoral links between sector activities and other sectors by
adopting a participatory and inclusive planning process.
134. Governance/value for money. The sector faces challenges arising out of the sector’s
unbundling with increased private sector participation and relatively young institutions to plan,
oversee, and regulate sector activities. Specifically, there are capacity gaps related to preparation of
PPPs and negotiation and enforcement of Power Purchase and Concession Agreements. This has
tended to dilute the perceived benefits of the ongoing PPPs in the generation and distribution
activities. IDA, over the CAS period, will support development of the requisite framework and
capacity in the areas of PPPs and project finance so as to leverage the available public financing and
at same time ensure value for money.
CAS Outcome 2.2: Improved access to and quality of roads
135. Analytical underpinnings. A PER on Strengthening the Impact of the Roads Budget (FY10)
recommends ways to improve the allocation of rural road budgets, and makes detailed
recommendations in relation to national roads, including design, land take, procurement, and
monitoring and evaluation, to improve value for money and absorption capacity.
136. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The Government of Uganda has embarked
on an ambitious program to scale up road sector investment and IDA is strongly committed to
continuing its support. The ongoing Road Development APL III (US$107.6 million, FY05) is 94
percent disbursed and scheduled to close in FY11. Executive Directors approved the Transport
Sector Development Project (TSDP, US$190 million) in December 2009 to pave sections of national
roads to Southern Sudan (Gulu-Atiak) and north-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (VurraArua-Oraba), finalizing these corridors to neighboring countries and improving growth prospects in
post-conflict northern Uganda. The TSDP is part of a sector-wide approach that finances a three-year
(FY11-FY13) time slice of the government’s National Transport Master Plan. Under the CAS,
additional financing to the TSDP (US$120 million, FY11) will finance the paving of Kamwenge-Fort
Portal in eastern Uganda, complementing work financed by the AfDB, and will improve roads and
drainage in Kampala. A second TSDP (US$160 million), planned for FY13 or FY14, will continue to
finance the National Transport Master Plan, including phase 1 of the Kampala Bus Rapid Transit.
137. Expected results from trust funds. Through the DfID Trust Fund for NDP Support, the
Bank will provide TA to the government on transport issues, including strengthening institutions and
increasing absorption capacity.
- 34 -

138. Development partners. In 2009, government and development partners established the first
sector-wide approach (SWAp) for the road sector. As part of the SWAp, DANIDA, EC, and IDA
provide coordinated institutional support for the road sector. The government and sector
stakeholders hold annual Joint Transport Sector Review meetings and quarterly performance reviews
to review progress against targets
139. Governance/value for money. There is growing negative public perception of road sector
procurement and quality control. A GPF Window 2 grant financed a GAC diagnostic for the
transport sector and the development of a Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plan (GAAP) for
the TSDP. A sector-wide GAAP for the transport sector is under preparation and will be a key
element of future Bank support.
CAS Outcome 2.3: Increased access to and quality of water and sanitation services
140. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank has had a long standing engagement in the water
supply and sanitation sector, supporting many of the key reforms that have led to the sector’s
turnaround. A study on “Environmental Sanitation in Uganda: Addressing Institutional and Financial
Challenges” (FY10) highlights the need to integrate budgets for sanitation and hygiene; address
institutional bottlenecks that underlie sanitation and hygiene promotion; and remove institutional
constraints that hinder solid waste management and drainage services. In FY11, the Bank will
conduct a study of “Ten Years of Budget Support to Improve Rural Water Supplies and Sanitation in
Uganda.”
141. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. Over the past decade, the Bank has mainly
supported rural water supply and sanitation through the PRSC and the Northern Uganda Social
Action Fund. A proposed integrated Water Sector Development and Management Project (US$130
million, FY13) will finance investments in water supply and sanitation in a number of priority towns
and cities, including several of the municipalities included in the Municipal Development Program
(FY12).
142. Expected results from trust funds. Two Output-Based Aid (OBA) water pilots will be
completed within the CAS period: one involving small local private operators in small towns and
rural growth centers, and the other involving expanding access to the urban poor through the
National Water and Sewerage Corporation. Results so far have been encouraging; and the
government and DPs are considering scaling-up OBA. During the CAS period, the WSP will provide
TA for a large-scale rural sanitation program addressing the enabling environment, local government
capacity building, and private sector participation. The WSP will continue to support the
implementation of large-scale sanitation programs in districts and helping to deliver sanitation and
improved water services to the poor in small towns.
143. IFC. Under the Small Scale Infrastructure Program in Water, IFC is providing advisory
assistance to the Ministry of Water and Environment and selected local governments to establish PPP
structures that encourage private water operators. The program is proceeding with a pilot in
Busembatia, has developed a generic PPP contract for replication in other towns, and has conducted
training for officials from 24 local governments. IFC is also working with Ugandan banks to
stimulate interest in commercial financing for the private operators, which would complement
concessional funding for a substantial portion of capital costs.
144. Regional integration. WBI has recently initiated steps to build a regional training hub in
Kampala, around the Water Academy established with NWSC support. The intention is to develop a
cadre of trained middle to senior managers in the region. Other related operations are the NBI and
- 35 -

LVEMP (US$27.5 million to Uganda) which address water resources related issues, but include
some element of water supply investments.
145. Development partners. The Bank is engaged in the Water Sector Development Group. This
effort has largely been focused on ensuring the success of budget support mechanism including the
PRSC. The Bank is working with ten other DPs to develop the PRSC and budget support
mechanism. It is also working with the AfDB, KFW, EC and DFID to review options for support to
NWSCs highly urbanized towns. UNICEF has a water and sanitation component as part of its “Keep
Children and Mothers Alive” program.
146. Governance/value for money. WSP and the World Bank have supported a Water Integrity
Scan, which has led to an Action Plan on Good Governance; and the GPF Window 1 grant will
support its implementation. WBI is helping the government pilot community and citizen score cards
to promote better governance.
CAS Outcome 2.4: Improved management and delivery of urban services
147. Analytical underpinnings. Cities Alliance is supporting the development of a national urban
policy and strategic urban development plan, which will provide a framework for interventions in the
urban sector.
148. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The Bank is committed to long-term support
for Kampala, secondary cities, and local governments through APLs. The ongoing Kampala
Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project APL I (KIIDP, FY08) will improve urban
planning and management in Kampala. The Transport Sector Development Project (TSDP, FY10)
finances detailed designs for a Bus Rapid Transit in Kampala and provides support to establish a
Metropolitan Area Transport Authority. Additional financing to TSDP (US$130 million, FY12) will
provide further support for Kampala roads and drainage. A proposed Municipal Infrastructure Project
(US$150 million, FY12) aims to improve management and accountability of thirteen secondary cities
to enable urbanization and structural transformation.
149. Expected results from trust funds. A recently-approved Cities Alliance grant (US$4.2
million) for the government’s “Strategy for Transforming Settlements of the Urban Poor in Uganda”
aims to help develop inclusive national urban development policies and strategies and begin
improving urban institutions and management in five municipalities, laying the foundation for the
proposed IDA-financed Municipal Infrastructure Project.
150. Development partners. The Bank is engaged in the Decentralization Sector Working Group,
which also includes Belgium, the EC, Ireland, the Netherlands, and UNDP. The UNDP has provided
US$250,000 to the government for urban sector baseline surveys, which will be used to formulate the
national urban policy and strategy. JICA is working with the government to improve urban roads and
traffic flow in Kampala.
151. Governance/value for money. The Bank has provided support for the development of a
good governance and anti-corruption strategy at the local government level; and its implementation is
supported by the Local Government Management and Service Delivery APL I. Under KIIDP, the
Bank has introduced citizen report cards as a tool for designing and monitoring investment projects
and to improve transparency and accountability to the citizens of Kampala.

F. Strategic Objective Three: Promote Human Capital Development
152. The CAS supports higher access to and quality of education and health care to improve
human development indicators and enable the transformation of the economy. In education,
expected results are increased percentages of students reaching literacy proficiency in governmentaided schools, and a higher average national gross enrollment rate for lower secondary education,
both with particular attention to girls’ schooling, which is expected to lower the fertility rate and
maternal mortality. To decrease maternal mortality, expected health care results include a higher
percentage of deliveries taking place in government and private not-for-profit health centers and a
higher contraceptive prevalence rate.
CAS Outcome 3.1: Improved access to and quality of primary and post-primary education
153. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank’s support is informed by the PER (2007), which
focused on education. The ongoing Universal Post-Primary Education and Training Program APL I
includes financing for analytical work to inform future policy and IDA support, such as double-shift
instruction and public-private partnerships in the provision of lower secondary education.
154. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The ongoing Universal Post Primary
Education and Training Program (UPPET) APL I (US$150 million, FY09) supports expanded access
to lower secondary education, including reforms to improve quality, efficiency, management
capacity, and rationalize staffing. The UPPET also supports the preparation of a strategy for business,
technical, and vocational education and training. UPPET APL II (US$100 million, FY13) will
strengthen reforms to improve access to and quality of lower secondary education, leading to
increases in gross enrollment from 28 percent to 40 percent by 2012, will provide strategic support
for improving upper secondary education, and will help support the findings of the strategy for
business, technical, and vocational education and training. The ongoing Millennium Science
Initiative (US$30 million, FY07) supports high quality scientific research awarded through a
transparent and competitive process, technology-based innovation and its adoption by the private
sector, and an outreach program to support science education. The Bank could provide additional
financing if requested to continue support for annual research grants. The Bank is also supporting
education through multisectoral operations: the ongoing Local Government Management Support
Project and Northern Uganda Social Action Fund II provide demand-driven financing at the local
level to improve access to education, and the PRSC series focuses on improving public service
delivery at the local government level, including quality of primary education.
155. Expected results from trust funds. Through the Education Program Development Fund, the
Bank is supporting the government to refine and rationalize its Education Sector Strategic Plan and
prepare a proposal for submission to the Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund to help meet the
financing gap to achieve universal primary education.
156. Governance/value for money. The Education Sector PER and follow-up work, such as the
Human Resource Management Actionable Governance Indicators study, highlighted sector
governance challenges, including teacher absenteeism and difficulties in deploying teachers to rural
and remote areas. An education sector governance diagnostic will be carried out to ensure that
UPPET APL II addresses core governance issues.
157. Development partners: Uganda receives substantial support from DPs to improve access
and quality of primary education, among these: UNICEF, EC, Ireland, Netherlands, UNFPA, and
USAID. AfDB, Belgium, GTZ, JICA, and the Netherlands also support post-primary education,
including technical and vocational education.
- 37 -

CAS Outcome 3.2: Strengthened health care delivery
158. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank’s PER Fiscal Space for Health in Uganda (FY08)
recommends ways to increase spending efficiency, especially by improving human resource
management (health worker absenteeism is a major source of waste), strengthening procurement and
logistics management of medicines and medical supplies, and better programming development
assistance for health. The PER is informing the Bank’s health policy dialogue and underpins the
lending program. During the CAS period, the Bank will help the Ministry of Health follow up the
issues identified in the PER, including through a policy paper on human resources for health and
policy notes on health financing.
159. Expected results from IDA-financed operations. The ongoing Local Government
Management Support Project and Northern Uganda Social Action Fund II provide demand-driven
financing at the local level to improve health care delivery, including by rehabilitating health centers.
The Uganda Health Systems Strengthening Project (US$130 million, FY10), which will be presented
to the Board together with this CAS, aims to strengthen national capacity to deliver essential health
services, with a particular focus on reproductive health, targeting activities which have been shown
to reduce maternal mortality and expanding access to family planning commodities and services. The
project includes US$30 million in Crisis Response Window resources to safeguard public spending
on reproductive health. The PRSC series and UPSPEP will complement the investment project by
addressing cross-cutting barriers to improved service delivery, such as lack of supply management
capacity, including procurement, poor human resources management and inadequate structures and
capacity for the management of health facilities.
160. Expected results from trust funds. The ongoing OBA Reproductive Health Program Pilot
in Western Uganda is expected to benefit 50,000 women by providing subsidized reproductive health
services and another 15,000 individuals through treatment for reduction in sexually transmitted
diseases. The Bank-administered trust fund, GPOBA (US$4.33 million) is working with KfW, which
is implementing the scheme and is providing co-financing of about US$3 million.
161. IFC. Under the IFC Health in Africa Initiative, Uganda is one of five countries identified for
a comprehensive policy assessment on the environment for private health care provision. This will
be complemented by a market assessment providing information for banks and other financial
institutions. Following completion of this advisory work, IFC also expects to identify investments in
the health sector, including PPPs, either for direct investment or indirect support through the two
equity funds IFC has established for health care investments in Africa, or lending from commercial
banks with IFC backing.
162. Regional integration. The Regional East Africa Public Health Laboratory Networking
Project (US$10 million for Uganda) will be presented to the Bank’s Executive Directors in May
2010, together with this CAS. It aims to help participating countries—Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania,
and Uganda—prevent and control the spread of communicable diseases in East Africa by sharing
information, developing harmonized approaches, strengthening laboratories, and establishing a center
of excellence in each county to provide regional leadership in a thematic area. The IGAD Regional
HIV/AIDS Partnership Program (IRAPP) Support Project aims to increase preventive actions reduce
misperceptions of cross border and mobile populations, refugees and surrounding host communities
concerning HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation and to establish a common and sustainable regional
approach to supporting these populations in the IGAD states.
163. Development partners. DPs supporting the health sector coordinate their activities through
the Health Development Partners Group. Belgium, DANIDA, DFID, Italy, and the Swedish
- 38 -

International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) support the health sector through general
and sector budget support. The US provides substantial support for health, especially through the
President’s Emergency Program for Aids Relief and the President’s Malaria Initiative. Global health
initiatives, including the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (US$300 million in
grants) and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (US$162 million over 5 years) provide
targeted support for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and immunization, although grants were suspended in 2005
over allegation of corruption. The suspensions have been lifted, but operations have not yet returned
to normal. The UN family has a number of interventions under Outcome 3 of the UN Development
Assistance Framework.
164. Governance. As part of the preparation of the Health Systems and Strengthening Project, the
Ministry of Health developed and adopted a governance strategy and action plan, which emphasizes
actions to strengthen health sector management functions and accountability and transparency in
service delivery. The project has a strong emphasis on improving human resource and budget
management, which are among the core challenges to effective service delivery. The project will
support aspects related to strengthening logistics management for drugs, which should lead to
improved drug availability and reduced wastage.
G. Strategic Objective Four: Good Governance and Value for Money
165. Strengthening value for money is critical for high-quality infrastructure investments
and service delivery, and thus for structural transformation. It is especially important in the
context of future oil wealth. Under the CAS, the Bank aims to strengthen accountability and improve
public financial management (PFM), public procurement, and public sector management at both
local and national levels.
CAS Outcome 4.1: Strengthened accountability and efficiency of public financial and human
resource management
166. Analytical underpinnings. A study “PFM Reform in Uganda—A Platform Approach”
(FY09) and a Public Financial Management Performance Report (PEFA Report, FY09) inform the
PFM reform agenda. PFM and procurement reform are supported by the Financial Management and
Accountability Program (FINMAP), a US$60 million basket fund financed by the government and
six DPs. The Bank is leading a restructuring of FINMAP to better focus on service delivery. During
the CAS period, FINMAP is expected to support the roll out of an integrated financial management
system (IFMIS); improve program-based budgeting with procurement planning integrated in the
budgeting process; strengthen accountability functions relating to internal audit, external audit,
procurement, and the oversight committees of parliament; and ensure that the PFM system supports
frontline service delivery. A pilot study on the use of Actionable Governance Indicators in human
resource management informs the design of public service reforms. Programmatic TA on governance
and anticorruption (FY11-15) will support key aspects of the public service reform agenda, focusing
particularly on ways of introducing and sustaining performance management, addressing equity in
service delivery, staffing of public service positions in rural areas, and tracking progress on public
service reform through a regular update of Actionable Governance Indicators on Human Resource
Management.
167. Expected results from IDA-financed operations. The Bank is supporting improved
governance and value for money at both the local and national levels. Since 2000, the Bank has
helped implement decentralization and build local government capacity and accountability to
citizens. The ongoing Local Government Management and Service Delivery APL I (LGMSD,
FY08), the Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project (FY08), and the Northern
- 39 -

Uganda Social Action Fund II (FY09) support more effective local government management,
including mechanisms to empower communities to demand better services from their local
governments. The LGMSD APL I finances capacity building and the rollout of an IFMS to all
districts and municipal governments to increase transparency and efficiency in public financial
management and public procurement. A proposed second phase, LGMSD APL II (US$115 million,
FY13), will ensure local government capacity to sustain transparent and accountable service delivery.
The PRSC series (Pillar 2 – Good Governance) will provide complementary, cross-cutting support
for decentralization by supporting transparent and efficient PFM and procurement, such as increasing
the number of local governments publishing financial transfers and budgets from 53 percent to 90
percent by 2011. The ongoing Uganda Public Service Performance Enhancement Project (UPSPEP)
supports the establishment of more transparent and efficient public service management systems,
including an integrated payroll and personnel management system that will decrease ghost workers
from 15 percent to 5 percent by 2013. The PRSC 8 (US$120 million, FY11) supports the adoption by
2011 of a public service pay system based on performance principles, increasing compliance with
procurement audit recommendations and increasing the number of contracts with records that comply
with public procurement regulations from 32 percent to 70 percent. The PRSC also supports piloting
a procurement indicator framework to track compliance with the procurement law in 15 ministries or
agencies, with further roll out expected under future operations. These indicators will inform the
design of future public procurement reforms.
168. Expected results from trust funds. A Governance Partnership Facility Window 1 grant
(US$1.48 million) will help reposition the Bank’s role on governance during the CAS period, by
financing further work on the Data Tracking Mechanism, political economy and GAC diagnostics in
various sectors, engagement with external stakeholders in implementing the GAAPs developed under
the GPF Window 2 grant, and peer learning sessions for Bank staff.
169. Development partners. DPs are developing a common approach to addressing GAC issues,
based on the OECD/DAC principles on constructive and collaborative engagement with government
counterparts, in the context of the Accountability Sector Working Group, co-led by DFID and the
World Bank. DFID is funding a capacity building program to strengthen accountability sector
institutions (including an emphasis on demand side accountability) and the EC is financing civil
society capacity building to enhance demand for good governance, particularly in relation to service
delivery. The Bank's agreed role is to manage a participatory process to develop the Data Tracking
Mechanism, an anti-corruption monitoring tool, to improve governance arrangements in investment
projects and to think through the re-positioning process related to the reduced reliance of government
on budget support.
H. Strengthening Aid Effectiveness
170. During the CAS period, the Bank will continue to promote donor harmonization and
aid effectiveness. The Bank is the permanent chair of the Local Development Partners’ Group
(LDPG), which is the apex development partner forum in Uganda. The LDPG and its sector/thematic
groups provide a forum for development partner coordination and interfacing with the government.
In addition, the Bank is the permanent co-chair of the Joint Budget Support Framework.
171. Under the LDPG, there are around 15 sector/thematic development partner groups
(DPGs). The Bank chairs or co-chairs seven of the DPGs. The DPGs serve to form common
positions and provide the LDPG with technical analysis feeding into policy dialogue with the
government, and recent efforts have attempted to make the DPGs more results-focused. Each of the
DPGs is mirrored by a government-chaired sector working group (SWG) or equivalent, with
participation from the government, DPs, civil society, and other stakeholders. Most SWGs function
- 40 -

as a practical forum for technical level discussions and elaboration of sector investment plans and
strategies, thus providing a basis for coordinated DP-government interventions.
172. The government will adopt a new Partnership Policy to provide a contractual
framework to advance the aid effectiveness agenda in Uganda. The NDP includes a section on
government-DP relations, outlining key issues related to aid effectiveness and stating the
government’s intention to adopt a new Partnership Policy addressing alignment of aid with national
priorities and systems, transaction costs, coordination issues, predictability of aid flows, mutual
accountability for development results, and partnerships beyond aid. The Partnership Policy is
expected to play an important role for the management of aid over the medium term, as oil revenues
gradually reduce the government’s reliance on external assistance.
173. The DPs undertake periodic division of labor exercises to encourage selectivity. The
2008 division of labor matrix is shown in Annex 18. Once the new Partnership Policy is adopted, it is
expected that DPs will undertake a new division of labor exercise under government leadership.
During the CAS period, the Bank will continue to encourage SWAps and joint supervision missions
where relevant.
I. Implementing and Monitoring the Country Assistance Strategy
174. The Bank will begin using Uganda’s financial management (FM) systems for
investment operations, in line with the Accra Agenda for Action and consistent with World
Bank financial management policy. The Bank undertook an assessment in April 2010 to identify
risks and mitigation measures. Uganda has already made a good start in the use of country FM
systems, as currently all Bank-financed investment projects are incorporated in the annual budget and
audited by the Office of the Auditor General. Under the CAS, use of country FM systems will be
considered for each investment lending operation, taking into account the project’s nature and
complexity and supplementary assessments of implementing ministry capacity.
175. The Bank will maintain a decentralized and high-capacity Uganda Country Office. Out
of 11 operations (including the Bujagali Project and the Reintegration and Demobilization MDTF),
13 are supervised by Task Team Leaders based in the Country Office or neighboring country offices,
and this will increase to 17 by the end of FY10. The Bank office includes the Cluster Leader for
governance for Central and East Africa is based in Kampala and a local governance specialist. The
Bank will establish a satellite office in Gulu, intended to be shared with the UN family, to strengthen
on-the-ground supervision of programs in northern Uganda, deepen our dialogue with local
government officials and other stakeholders, and improve our understanding of issues affecting the
poorest part of the country. In total, the office currently comprises 81 staff and consultants.
176. The CAS Results Framework presents the results chain for the Bank’s program of
support (see Annex 1). The framework uses Uganda’s NDP as its starting point, and narrows down
the range of outcomes to those that the Bank can demonstrably influence over the CAS period. CAS
outcomes will be monitored jointly by the Bank and the government over the CAS period. Also, the
Bank will use the new Country Program Results Monitoring Tool to monitor portfolio impact and
progress towards CAS outcomes. Since most of the new operations foreseen in this CAS will likely
not finish implementation until after 2015, results during this CAS period will come mainly from
existing operations and the quicker-disbursing interventions included in the CAS.
177. The Bank will carry out annual results-based CPPRs, building on the matrix of actions
from the recent CPPR (see para. 78 and Annex 11).
- 41 -

178. Trust funds are fully integrated in the CAS and will be managed accordingly. The Bank
has already taken measures to integrate trust fund programs and budgets with Bank-funded programs
and to ensure that trust funds are aligned with the CAS. Analytical work and policy notes funded by
trust funds undergo the same rigorous review as Bank budget-funded analytical work; and trust fundfinanced activities are implemented in accordance with the same fiduciary requirements as IDAfinanced operations. The Country Management Unit has established a trust fund management team
(including fiduciary and governance staff) to guide the use and management of the new
programmatic DFID and JBSF trust funds.
179. The Bank will prepare a CAS Progress Report in FY13, or earlier if needed, to evaluate
progress toward CAS outcomes and adjust strategy and program. The Progress Report will be
completed after Uganda’s national elections in 2011, allowing consideration of new government
policy. By FY13, there will be a clearer picture of the oil sector, which is likely to impact the Bank’s
strategy and program. Adjustments to projects under implementation will be reflected in revised
project results frameworks.

- 42 -

V. RISKS AND MITIGATION
180. There are considerable risks for CAS implementation, especially in light of the March
2011 presidential and parliamentary elections and the recent discovery of oil. However, risks
would be even higher if Uganda does not move forcefully down the path of structural transformation
as required to increase growth, create employment for the growing labor force, and further reduce
poverty and inequality, and if Uganda does not build the transparent and accountable institutional
arrangements needed to manage future oil wealth.
181. Political risks are heightened by ethnic and regional divisions and by upcoming
elections. Since independence, ethnic and regional divisions have contributed to conflict and
influenced politics. While Uganda has made progress towards democracy, it has not yet established
an enduring political process through which all groups, regardless of region or ethnicity, have a
meaningful stake and can contest for power. In this context, governance and stability could
deteriorate in advance of presidential and parliamentary elections in 2011. Civil disturbances
resulting from clashes between the central government and the Buganda Kingdom in September 2009
have revealed some of the fractures in the political landscape.
182. There is a risk of policy reversals due to election pressures and when oil exploitation
begins. Frustration over the slow pace of structural transformation could lead some policy makers to
question pro-market policies and advocate for more state intervention. Also, as oil revenues come on
stream, reliance on donor assistance and their economic advice may decrease.
183. The “oil curse” represents the most substantial risk. The discovery of a valuable natural
resource in the context of poverty often increases the risk of conflict and poor governance. Even
when countries stay at peace, resource wealth typically leads to reduced growth, because resource
rents lead to increased patronage, negatively affecting governance and public investment. The more
ethnically diverse the society, the worse the performance of a resource-rich democracy, because
patronage is especially effective in ethnically diverse settings, and because oil can exacerbate
existing ethnic and regional cleavages. To avoid the “oil curse,” Uganda must manage citizen
expectations and establish an institutional framework that ensures transparent and accountable
management of oil revenues for the benefit of all Ugandans.
184. Electoral pressures and oil wealth could exacerbate negative trends in governance.
Corruption, both high-level and small-scale, is increasingly pervasive, affecting infrastructure
investments; productive sectors, such as agriculture; and social services. A governance risk matrix
has been designed to map these risks as well as risk mitigation strategies (see Annex 6). The Bank
will conduct regular reviews of governance risks to adapt the CAS program as required, including the
balance between budget support and investment lending.
185. Growing numbers of poor, uneducated, urban youth could create further challenges.
With about half the population below the age of 15, Uganda has one of the youngest populations in
the world. According to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (2007) up to 58 percent of Uganda’s
unemployed are youth with the greatest risk of unemployment being the educated youth entering the
labor market for the first time. An estimated 490,000 youths enter the labor market annually, yet the
formal sector (both public and private) creates only about 150,000 jobs each year. Unemployed youth
or underemployed youth tend to degenerate into “discouraged workers” who can easily be mobilized
for rebellion and social unrest. This was evident during the September 2009 riots, where the majority
of those arrested for participating were unemployed youth. The World Bank will work closely with
the Youth Unemployment Network to update the National Action Plan on youth unemployment for
Uganda.
- 43 -

186. As a landlocked country, Uganda is particularly affected by the security situation in
neighboring countries. For example, political strife in Kenya following the controversial election
disrupted Uganda’s key trade route, underscoring the need to develop alternative trade routes.
Although the general situation in the region has improved, new or recurring conflicts are possible
during the CAS period. The run-up or aftermath of the independence referendum in Southern Sudan
in 2011 could affect the stability and security situation in Sudan and thereby regional trade and
remittances. Lack of political stability in Southern Sudan could also provide an avenue for the return
of LRA activities in northern Uganda. There is also the risk of refugees returning to Uganda into
areas that are currently recovering from a long period of insecurity. The development of resources
around Lake Albert could be a source of tension with neighboring DRC.
187. Other exogenous risks include weather and the associated impact on international
prices for agricultural goods. Weather conditions, such as droughts, have a strong influence on the
output of the agricultural sector and on the availability of hydroelectricity. Uganda is vulnerable to
other natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, and storms, which are likely to
increase as climate variability becomes more pronounced.

Annex 6: Oil in Uganda
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In recent years, there have been significant oil discoveries along the Albertine Rift in
western Uganda. Reserves of at least 800 million barrels have been confirmed to date, and the basin
is now believed to contain up to 2 billion barrels of oil. Even at conservative prices, oil revenue will
be considerable, potentially doubling government revenue within 6-10 years and constituting an
estimated 10-15 percent of GDP at peak production. However, oil price volatility will make revenue
and budget management a persistent challenge.
2.
Extensive exploration activities along Uganda’s Albertine Rift started in 2003-04.
Currently, five of nine exploration areas are licensed to four companies. UK independent Tullow Oil
is at the most advanced stage of exploration and currently holds three blocks that comprise multiple
discoveries. Tullow is in the process of buying out its former partner Heritage Oil and is now seeking
to form a joint venture with one or more major international oil companies that can bring capital and
expertise to the projects as they move into the development phase.
3.
Tullow has estimated that it could produce between 150,000 and 200,000 barrels per
day over a 25-year production period. While timelines remain tentative, production is likely to be
phased and will be driven by the pace of infrastructure development. Limited production of 10,00020,000 barrels per day, primarily for domestic use, could start within two to three years, using
trucking and railroad transportation. Full scale production could be reached in five to seven years,
once downstream infrastructure is in place. Only at this stage would the government begin to realize
significant revenue from oil production.
4.
Oil production will require significant infrastructure development. Discussions about the
downstream processing and export of oil are ongoing. The government favors the construction of a
refinery in Uganda to serve the domestic and regional market. The oil companies are exploring a
number of export options, including the construction of a pipeline through Uganda and Kenya to
Mombasa and the possibility of exporting crude oil via rail and water through Kenya or Tanzania.
Tullow is estimating an investment of several billion dollars over the next five to ten years to develop
the requisite oil infrastructure. Regardless of the path chosen, large infrastructure programs could
generate employment and other economic opportunities but will also put pressure on government
regulatory and oversight systems.
5.
The Government of Uganda is receiving support from Norway under an Oil for
Development Program to improve the institutional framework for management of oil
resources. In 2008, Uganda adopted a new National Oil and Gas Policy that reflects best
international practices in all important respects and calls for the establishment of several new
institutions and structures. These include a Directorate of Petroleum to set and monitor policy; a
Petroleum Authority to regulate the sector; a national oil company to hold the country’s direct
investment in oil projects; and a Petroleum Fund under the management of the Central Bank to
stabilize the revenue flow to the budget. Important legal amendments and developments will be
needed to implement the Oil and Gas Policy. Amendments to the Petroleum Act are being prepared,
and revisions to the revenue code related to the fiscal regime for oil are under preparation. A division
within the Ministry of Energy – the Petroleum Exploration and Production Department (PEPD) – has
been established to manage developments in the petroleum sector. While these developments are
welcome, it will also be vital to strengthen institutional capacity within respective ministries and
agencies to make the policy and legal framework operational.
- 60 -

6.
Uganda’s oil resources are located in ecologically sensitive and valuable areas; several
of the exploration areas are within or border on national parks. The general framework for
management of Uganda’s environmental resources is set out in the 1995 National Environment Act,
which created the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA). This act also sets out the
process by which companies are required to conduct Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs),
administered by NEMA. However, NEMA has little capacity to analyze EIAs and monitor the
implementation of environmental requirements.
7.
Oil prospects bring both opportunities and challenges. The economic impact of oil
production could be profound, with dramatic increases in foreign direct investment and domestic
revenue in the medium term and the possibility of reducing energy costs. But it may also bring
inflationary pressures, exchange rate appreciation, and new governance challenges. The so-called
“Dutch Disease” effect may impact the competitiveness of Uganda’s agricultural exports, and it is
likely to make the country’s growth strategy – with an emphasis on value added, export
diversification, and manufacturing – harder to achieve. This would threaten to increase, rather than
decrease, the income gap. However, the government has indicated its intention to earmark oil
revenue for strategic public investments, which could help to increase productivity in other sectors
and thereby offset the effects of Dutch Disease.
8.
Experience from around the world also suggests that natural resource discoveries
commonly decrease government transparency and accountability and increase corruption, as
the government becomes less dependent on the local tax base. While the 2008 National Oil and
Gas Policy promises transparency and strong accountability measures for oil revenue, the
government has not been very forthcoming to date with information about sector developments or the
terms of the production sharing agreements with oil companies. This has raised public concerns
about lack of transparency that are compounded by the government’s expressed reluctance to sign on
to the EITI. The government also faces the difficult challenge of managing high public expectations
of immediate social benefits stemming from the country’s oil riches. Public and political pressure,
especially in the run up to the 2011 election, could fuel rapid and unsystematic public spending.
9.
The government will also need to consider the impact of oil on other sensitive national
issues, such as land policy, fiscal decentralization, and regional cooperation. The debate about
land rights is becoming fiercer in the run up to petroleum production, and speculative land purchases
in the oil rich regions have already begun. The recently enacted Land Bill revealed significant
tensions between “indigenous” tribal claims to land and land rights for settlers or migrants. The
benefits sharing arrangement between central and local government is also a thorny issue that has yet
to be tackled publicly, and the government’s recent pattern of subdividing districts, often along
ethnic lines, could intensify local political interests over national interests. The oil discoveries are
primarily in poor and conflict prone regions, and thus tension over access to the oil benefits, be they
revenue, jobs, or social benefits, threaten to fuel existing social fissures and local grievances. Local
politicians and traditional leaders in oil rich regions are already advocating for more resources to be
allocated to their respective communities. Furthermore, oil may impact external relations. The
Ugandan and Congolese Governments have yet to fully resolve disputes about the border through
Lake Albert, which caused a flare up in 2007.
II. PRODUCTION FORECASTS AND MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS
(i)

INDICATIVE PRODUCTION AND REVENUE FORECASTS

10.
Despite investor and government appetite for early revenue, full-scale production is
likely to be reached only in 2016 or later, once downstream infrastructure in place. Although
- 61 -

the pace of production ramp up will be governed by infrastructure (see Table 6.1), the duration of
plateau production will depend on the ultimate quantity of reserves. At the current estimate of 800
million barrels of reserves, plateau production could be sustained for 10 years or so before natural
field decline sets in. If the proved resource base expands to 1.2 billion barrels (not unreasonable
given the 2 billion barrel total basin potential cited by Tullow and others) peak production could be
maintained for 20 years or more. These two scenarios are presented for illustrative purposes in Figure
1. Given the level of uncertainty around timing and volume of oil production, the figures
should not be treated as revenue projections, but merely as illustrations of the possible fiscal
impact.
11.
Using the indicative baseline reserve scenario of 800 million barrels, government
revenue could double once peak production is reached and after investors recoup their costs.
Using the current fiscal regime and a Brent price assumption of US$75 per barrel through the
projection period, government oil revenue at peak production is estimated to gradually increase from
US$1.6 billion to US$2.4 billion per year (see Table 6.2) over the peak production period (20162024). There is a lag between reaching peak production and peak revenue flows to Government of
one to two years due to investor recovery of capital and operating costs.

(ii) MANAGING REVENUE VOLATILITY

12.
Due to the volatility of oil prices, government oil revenue can be expected to vary
enormously from year to year even under the stable production scenarios described above.
Recent oil price experience confirms that prices can change by 50 percent or more from one year to
the next. Short term price shocks can result in even sharper movements. At US$40 per barrel
(roughly 50 percent lower than today’s prices), Uganda’s oil revenue would drop to US$800-900
million. If low prices were to occur during the startup period when investors are recovering their
costs, government revenue could be depressed even further to US$400 million or so. Conversely, if
prices increase to US$120 per barrel, government revenue could climb to well over US$4 billion per
year. The likelihood that annual oil revenue could vary to such a degree, even under a stable
production scenario, will present a persistent governance challenge for Uganda.
13.
There is a need to protect the budget from potentially large fluctuations in oil revenue.
If variations in revenue are allowed to spill into the fiscal operations, they are likely to adversely
affect economic management, as they will undermine the medium term fiscal framework and
frustrate investment planning. Windfall revenue may also fuel unsustainable recurrent expenditure. If
oil revenue is shared with local governments, they could also destabilize local government financing.
Regardless of the revenue sharing arrangements chosen, responsibility for stabilization of oil revenue
should be managed by the central government, as local governments’ capacity to manage such
mechanisms is limited.

Appropriate legal arrangements and stabilization mechanisms as well as prudent fiscal
management would help to shield fiscal operations against this variability. First, the legal and
regulatory framework for oil revenue needs to include appropriate stability clauses that include
capital recovery rules, income and withholding tax rates, royalty rates, and maximum rate in import
duties. Second, a stabilization mechanism would be required to fix the amount of resources allowed
to flow into the budget and the balance that can be saved/invested outside the government budget. In
the National Oil and Gas Policy, the government has indicated its intentions to establish a Petroleum
Fund to create a permanent source of wealth as a provision for intergenerational equity. However, the
types of fund and management modalities have yet to be articulated. There are two main types of
stabilization mechanisms: under a Stabilization Fund arrangement, a reference price for oil is
established, and only the revenue from oil production evaluated at that reference price is transferred
to the budget, while the rest is invested in the Fund. A Permanent Income Fund is used to invest oil
revenue and channels only the interest rate revenue from the accumulated assets to the budget. Once
the government has decided on the type of stabilization mechanism to use, it will need to select the
operational modalities. If it is to be a Stabilization Fund, the reference price above which revenue is
transferred into the budget will need to be specified. If it is to be a Permanent Income Fund,
management and investment options for this fund (domestic or external) will need to be specified.
15.
Fiscal prudence, as established over the past two decades, will help ensure that oil
revenue is used productively. Given Uganda’s level of development, the demographic pressures of
a fast growing young population, and the public’s anticipated gains from oil revenue, there will be
strong social pressures to increase public spending on infrastructure, education and health services,
and raise public service wages. Politicians will be hard pressed to show rapid dividends from the
country’s oil wealth. The National Oil and Gas Policy emphasizes that oil revenue will be utilized not
for consumption but for capital investment and infrastructure development. An effective process is to
be established to evaluate investment proposals to be financed by the oil revenue based on forecast
rates of return. Strengthened institutional capacity, rigorous budgeting processes, and strict controls
will help safeguard these aims. Uganda may also want to consider the enactment of a Fiscal
Responsibility Law, as has been done in several other countries, to reduce the discretionary power of
using windfall revenue.
(iii)

DOWNSTREAM PRODUCTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHOICES

16.
Uganda’s oil reserves vastly exceed the amount that could be consumed domestically, or
even regionally. Currently, Uganda consumes 13,000 barrels per day of petroleum products (fuel oil
and distillates), and this figure reaches approximately 24,000 barrels per day if it includes demand
from Rwanda, Burundi, and neighboring parts of eastern DRC. Regional demand is growing rapidly
and could reach 50,000 barrels per day in 10-15 years.
17.
Nevertheless, the government has declared its intent to refine all Ugandan crude within
Uganda. While improving Uganda’s fuel supply security, a domestic refinery carries profound risk
for Uganda. A world class refinery in a landlocked country with undiversified crude supply
undoubtedly will face severe commercial challenges. Even a small-scale refinery tailored to
Uganda’s domestic fuel needs will diminish the scale economies of export infrastructure without
necessarily reducing domestic fuel prices. There will be a temptation to embed hidden fuel subsidies
within a domestic refining entity. Reducing the price of crude oil feedstock to improve the
profitability of the refinery would reduce the value of the upstream oil production ventures where
large resource rents are set to be captured. However, the greater risk for Uganda is that protracted
debate over domestic refining strategy will delay important export infrastructure decisions.

- 64 -

18.
Exporting oil would require the construction of a 1300 km export pipeline to an Indian
Ocean port. The most likely route would be through Kenya to Mombasa following the route of the
existing Kenya Pipeline, although port congestion in Mombasa is causing the oil companies to
consider other routes, some of which would pass through Tanzania instead of Kenya. Whatever route
is selected and whatever technology is used to assure flow (heating, dilution, or treatment), a
complex 1300 km pipeline would probably cost US$2-3 billion to construct and result in a
transportation tariff of US$ 8-10 per barrel. Forming the investment consortium for such a pipeline
and concluding the necessary commercial and financing agreements would be a complicated
undertaking. Access rules must be sorted out through policy and contract. Transit fees must be
established between Uganda and Kenya through what could be a difficult treaty negotiation. Using
the timeline of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline as a guide, these preconstruction activities could take
three years or more to complete. Assuming a further three years for construction, the earliest that an
export pipeline could enter service is 2016, and even this date carries substantial risk.

THE IMPACT OF “DUTCH DISEASE”

19.
Among the other economic challenges, resource booms normally cause the currency to
appreciate as demand increases. This causes prices for non tradable goods to rise and reduces
productivity as factors shift to the non tradable sector and raise reallocation and transition costs,
which makes temporary specialization very costly. Such a phenomenon, normally referred to as a
‘Dutch Disease’, materializes due a mismatch between demand and supply. Prices rise with increased
demand only if supply does not expand to match the increased demand. Hence, the key point to
emphasize is that although the economy’s capacity to absorb big oil revenue may have
macroeconomic implications, capacity constraints are essentially microeconomic “supply side”
phenomena.
20.
Concerns about the “Dutch Disease” in Uganda are not new, given the country’s long
history as a large recipient of external funding. In fact, Uganda already possesses some of the
symptoms of Dutch Disease. There is a large and growing non tradeable, non agricultural sector, and
costs of non tradeables are high. Nonetheless, the real exchange rate remains substantially more
depreciated than in the mid-1990s despite a slight reversal from trend in recent years (and a slight
slowing of real merchandise export growth). Given the expected appreciation of the currency that
would come with sustained large foreign inflows from the oil, it will be important for the government
to focus on other factors that determine export competitiveness. Uganda’s landlocked situation, high
transport costs, high fuel costs, and poor electricity supply, are important considerations in this
respect. It will therefore be important to use the oil revenue optimally to generate productivity gains
and growth. The government may also want to consider how and if the country’s oil and gas
resources can help to increase availability and reduce the cost of energy. While it is advisable to
allow market forces to determine domestic pricing of petroleum products, it is nonetheless important
to promote a competitive market so that any fall in crude oil prices are passed on to the consumers.

EFFECTIVE

MANAGEMENT

OF

OIL

LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

21.
Uganda’s existing legal framework for petroleum sector governance is focused on
promotion and exploration activities and needs to be updated and expanded. Petroleum
exploration and production activities in Uganda are governed by the Petroleum (Exploration and
Production) Act, Chapter 150 of the Laws of Uganda 2000 (the “Petroleum Act”). This law permits
the award of petroleum licenses to private entities under certain conditions and gives the mandate for
- 65 -

directing the upstream petroleum sector to the responsible Minister, currently the Minister of Energy
and Mineral Development. The Minister receives applications for any petroleum rights and is
responsible for issuing, renewing, and revoking petroleum exploration and production licenses. The
Petroleum Act also establishes the position of Commissioner for Petroleum Exploration and
Development, who is responsible for carrying out petroleum exploration promotion, initiating
petroleum legislation, and monitoring oil companies’ compliance with existing laws, regulations, and
agreements. The Petroleum Act and corresponding regulations has served Uganda well during the
promotion, licensing, and exploration phase but needs to be updated substantially to handle the
development and production of oil and gas, appropriately capture recent trends and best practice in
the industry, and harmonize with a future revenue management law.
22.
The government’s overall policy on oil and gas exploration and production is laid out in
the National Oil and Gas Policy for Uganda, adopted in 2008. This well crafted document reflects
international best practices in all important respects. It declares Government’s intention “to use the
country’s oil and gas resources to contribute to early achievement of poverty eradication and create
lasting value to society.” It sets very high standards in the key areas of resource, revenue, and
environmental management. It promotes measures to defend the non-oil sector against the onset of
the “resource curse” and it commits Government to transparency and accountability in the
management of oil revenues. Consistent with best practice, the policy calls for the establishment of
three separate institutions to manage the sector: an oil and gas policy making and monitoring body
within the Ministry (Directorate of Petroleum), an independent regulatory agency (Petroleum
Authority of Uganda), and a separate commercial entity to hold Government’s direct participation in
oil developments (the Uganda National Oil Company).
23.
While there is broad recognition within the government of the need to enact a revenue
management law, amend the Petroleum Act, update the regulations, and establish the new institutions
called for in the policy, none of the necessary legislation has yet been brought forward.
(ii)

TRANSPARENCY OF OIL SECTOR MANAGEMENT AND EITI

24.
Although the government has stated its intention to manage the country’s oil resources
with full transparency, implementation of such transparency measures has been limited to
date. While not a sufficient precondition to ensure prudent resource management, transparency
measures make it easier for civil society and the media to scrutinize performance in the oil sector and
thereby hold the Government and private sector to account. Although the country’s national oil and
gas policy calls for transparent resource management, Government has been reluctant to share
information regarding contracts, and the terms of the Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs) signed
have not been disclosed. Uganda has so far argued that this is not in the country’s commercial
interest. The authorities have also expressed reluctance about joining EITI on the grounds that this
initiative signals that the country in question has weak/nontransparent revenue management systems.
While a case could be made for these arguments, Uganda’s deteriorating governance and
international concerns about weak control of corruption should encourage Government do more
rather than less to demonstrate a commitment to transparency and thereby encourage confidence in
its oil management systems.
25.
While the discussion on transparency has so far focused mainly on the disclosure or
nondisclosure of PSAs, there are a number of other aspects of transparency in oil sector management
that equally need attention. Of particular importance in this regard are the modalities for marketing
the government’s share of oil production, an issue closely related to the question of ‘refinery vs.
pipeline’. International experience shows that this is the aspect of oil sector management that is most
prone to fraud and abuse of public resources.
- 66 -

a. Transparency in commercialization operations: national oil company vs.
international operators
26.
Some of the greatest risks of opacity lie in the planned creation of a national oil company
to hold the state’s direct interest in oil production projects and to market the state’s share of oil
production. The experience of establishing and operating national oil firms in the African context
has shown that these firms are often non transparent, inefficient and an instrument for patronage.
While progress has been made in some countries in reforming national firms, experience shows that
once such institutions get off to a bad start, it becomes hard or even impossible to make corrections
along the way, as vested interests are notoriously difficult to dislodge. Success in some instances has
been achieved by forcing the national oil company to adopt a purely commercial role rather than that
of a de facto regulator. In Uganda the risks of mismanagement of marketing practices is exacerbated
by the plans to build a refinery. International practice shows that transactions between national oil
firms and state owned refineries are prone to price manipulation, often at the cost of the treasury and,
by extension, the population.
27.
Two alternative solutions can be proposed for addressing these risks. First, in case a
national oil firm is created and charged immediately with oil marketing functions, there is a
need to institute high levels of transparency in the operations of such structures from the start,
as well as adhering to high professional standards. Measures worth considering to safeguard
transparency include: i) having the accounts of the national oil firm or other structure charged with
oil marketing audited by audit firms of international reputation; ii) ensuring publication of the
findings of such audits, as well as of follow up actions taken by the structure; and iii) conducting
regular reviews of marketing procedures. A further set of actions should focus on the choice of
intermediaries in oil marketing. Setting criteria for choosing intermediaries and ensuring that national
oil marketing structures deal only with firms of international reputation is an effective mitigating
measure to prevent the kind of ‘insider trading’ that is one of the largest sources of revenue loss to oil
producing countries.19 Lastly, the rapid development of training programs in the sector, as well as a
bursary system that could have locals rapidly trained in the principles of oil sector management,
would be essential to safeguard professional standards.
28.
Second, a transition period could be agreed during which oil marketing operations of
the state share of production would be contracted out to an international operator, under
disclosed terms. This would allow Government to build up the capacity of the national firm and
define transparent rules and procedures. The national firm would then take over the marketing tasks
after this transition period.
29.
Finally, in case a refinery option would be chosen, transparent and fully disclosed price
setting mechanisms for the transfer of part of the state share to the refinery would need to be
set.
b. Transparency in revenue generation and management
30.
Transparency in the transfer of oil revenue from the marketing structure to
government, as well on any taxes paid by international operators, is a further essential element.

19

Consisting of national oil trading structures trading with ‘front intermediaries,’ which basically are owned by
related nationals, and thus lead to large revenue losses as oil is sold on unfavorable terms to maximize profits of the
intermediaries.

- 67 -

Apart from the creation of an EITI-like monitoring structure, the verification of oil sector revenue
and their effective transfer to the Treasury will contribute further to a transparency agenda.
31.
Government may consider internationally established “best practice” principles with
regard to public disclosure of oil revenue. Regardless of whether or not the Government chooses to
formally adhere to the EITI, it is advisable that EITI principles are respected in the way oil revenue is
managed, as EITI principles have become a minimum standard for good management of oil revenue.
Thus, it would be essential to institutionalize the following actions in a routine manner:




Disclosure by private firms operating in the oil sector of taxes paid to Government, and verification of
receipt by Treasury;
Disclosure by the national structure in charge of oil marketing of revenue transferred to Treasury, and
verification of receipt; and
Creation of a multi stakeholder structure, including members of civil society, to monitor revenue
flows.20

c. Transparency in the use of revenue
32.
Finally, a commitment to enhanced transparency in the use of oil resources is
important, as experience shows that resources are squandered as often in the downstream process
(investment project choices and procurement) as in the revenue generation process. The section on
investment management (below) elaborates on this. In the context of oil, it will become even more
important to ensure that measures related to the transparent selection of projects according to sound
economic principles and transparent application of procurement rules are enforced.
(iii)

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE

33.
Much of Uganda’s exploitable oil is located in ecologically sensitive and biodiversity
rich areas, which poses a particular challenge for oil and gas exploration and development in
Uganda. The Albertine Graben is the most species rich eco region for vertebrates in Africa. The
principal threats to biodiversity in Uganda include habitat loss, modification, and alteration,
including specifically oil exploration and production. Another complicating factor is that much of the
oil is adjacent to or under the Albertine Lakes, which presents the threat of contamination of large
water bodies.
34.
The oil rich areas are also key ecotourism sites (for example, Murchison Falls National
Park) with high tourism potential. Oil exploration and production activities could have a variety of
negative impacts on the environment. They induce economic, social, and cultural changes through
alteration in land use patterns, migration, and socioeconomic and cultural systems. They also
increase liquid and gaseous waste streams, which may affect plant and animal communities due to
changes in their environment through variations in water, air, and soil/sediment quality and through
disturbance by noise, extraneous light, and changes in vegetation cover. These negative impacts need
to be mitigated and addressed to ensure ecosystem integrity.
35.
To minimize adverse impacts of oil exploitation on the environment, Uganda needs to
update and strengthen its environmental laws and regulations, strengthen institutional
capacity, and provide adequate resources to ensure enforcement. The environmental impacts of

20

This would constitute a “minimum package” but does not cover the full EITI menu, which also includes
disclosure of PSAs.

- 68 -

oil and gas exploration and development are regulated through the National Environment Act, Cap.
153, and related laws and regulations that prohibit degradation of the natural environment and protect
biological diversity. Existing legislation, guidelines, and policies that enforce/provide for detailed
requirements for environment pollution control are, however, inadequate for petroleum operations,
and the existing legal framework (policies, laws and regulations) in other sectors needs to be updated,
as well. Furthermore, human capacity and technical infrastructure in government agencies
responsible for regulation are currently inadequate to handle upstream and downstream oil and gas
impacts on the environment and require further strengthening. In addition, there is inadequate
knowledge about the environment and possible environmental impacts of oil and gas exploration and
development activities.
(iv)

BUILDING DOMESTIC CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN THE OIL SECTOR

36.
Capacity building will be required to ensure that the oil sector has a transparent and
effective management system and delivers employment opportunities to Ugandan nationals.
Capacity is required in many forms, but crucial gaps include: negotiation capacity to ensure that
PSAs are negotiated in Government’s favor; oil marketing capacity to ensure that state owned oil
resources are sold at the proper market value; oil revenue forecasting and links to budgeting; and
skills related to management of royalties from petroleum, oil and gas exploration and processing,
natural resource management, and civic engagement with communities.
37.
Government, through the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES), plans to establish
the Uganda Petroleum Institute as a constituent college of Busitema University for purposes of
building capacity through vocational training in oil and gas industry trades. Courses will be
given up to Crafts and Master levels (equivalent to Ugandan low and high level certificates) together
with ordinary diplomas. Curricula development is underway, and MoES has articulated the need to
support human resource development for faculty and infrastructure developments (laboratories,
equipment, and workshop installations). MoES vehicles for promoting these needs include the
Education Sector Consultative Committee and the Education Budget Working Group. Further, the
faculty of science at Makerere University introduced a bachelor’s program in petroleum science in
the academic year 2008/09. Quality delivery requires regular interface with oil sites and collaborative
arrangements that provide staff with short term skills improvement programs. As part of the National
Oil and Gas policy, Government plans to conduct a comprehensive assessment of capacity needs for
all supporting institutions.
38.
The plan to create a Petroleum Institute is an important step in the right direction when
it comes to creating long term capacity. However, two complicating factors need to be addressed.
Retaining graduates of such an institute at public service wage levels will prove difficult. This poses
risks not only in terms of capacity gaps between the producing country and international operators,
but also inside the national institutional system, as non public service institutions will be able to
attract graduates while other institutions, such as the Ministry of Finance, may not. This puts
Government at risk of being unable to control its own operators. Furthermore, while setting up a
Petroleum Institute would address medium term expertise needs, it will not address critical short term
requirements. Therefore, the creation of the institute should be accompanied by development of a
limited bursary program (possibly supported by external partners) to deliver crash course type
training to a small core group of experts.
39.
Finally, it is important that capacity building is not just limited to government and
parastatals but also benefits the broader civil society. Stimulating the development of expertise in
civil society and oversight institutions is equally critical, and these institutions may not necessarily
benefit from the institute. Thus, creating funding opportunities for NGOs and think tanks to
- 69 -

strengthen their expertise on oil sector governance issues, for instance through a ‘development
market place’ competitive mechanism of grant awards, would be an essential supplement to the
creation of a National Petroleum Institute.
IV. OIL REVENUE AND COMMUNITY ISSUES
(i)

OIL REVENUE AND INTER-GOVERNMENTAL FISCAL TRANSFERS

40.
The government has yet to announce if and how oil revenue will be shared with local
governments and how communities affected by oil production will be compensated. Experience
from other countries in Africa, most notably Nigeria, has shown that the importance of revenue
sharing arrangements between central and local governments and benefits that offset the adverse
effects of oil production on local communities. These play a key role in ensuring social cohesion and
a stable investment and production environment. Furthermore, pressures may arise across the country
for increased budget allocations to local governments to satisfy high public expectations of benefits
from oil production.
41.
Uganda’s policy of decentralization is embedded in the Constitution and is one of the
major policy reforms adopted by government in the 1990s. The policy transferred a number of
service delivery mandates from the central to local governments. Today, basic services such as
primary education; primary health care; water and sanitation; district, urban, community, and access
roads; and agriculture extension are being provided by LGs. Given the LG’s weak revenue base and
the recent abolition of the graduated tax, which was one of the major revenue sources for rural LGs,
most service delivery mandates for LGs are being financed through transfers from central
government. Despite an increase in the service delivery responsibilities of local governments and the
creation of many new districts, the proportion of the budget allocated to local governments has been
decreasing in recent years, which is reducing the efficiency of expenditure in the social service
sectors. In anticipation of oil revenue, pressure is likely to mount on the central government to
increase the share of the budget allocated to local governments.
42.
Once the oil revenue comes on stream and more revenue becomes available to the
government, it will need to address comprehensively the current debate about LG financing
and propose a clear policy regarding intergovernmental fiscal transfers. Government is preparing to
undertake a study to determine a holistic strategy for LG financing that will cover LG’s own source
revenue and fiscal transfers. This study offers an opportunity for Government to investigate the
impact of oil revenue on LG financing. Government also needs to address what direct benefit would
accrue to the districts and communities from which the oil is being extracted, over and above the
general resources being transferred to LGs through the IGFT. These transfers/benefits should be
provided in an equitable manner that will ensure the unity and cohesion (not tensions and
disintegration) of the country.
(ii)

OIL AND LAND POLICY

43.
To commence oil production, oil companies and the government will need to acquire
land for oil production facilities and infrastructure. This requires adequate institutional provisions
for land allocation, purchases and leasing arrangements. The Constitution of Uganda (1995) and the
Land Act, Cap 227, vests all land in Uganda in its citizens under four tenure systems: (i) freehold, (ii)
leasehold, (iii) mailo, and (iv) customary tenure. These systems provide the framework for protecting
the rights of the citizens and ensuring they are not deprived of personal property without
compensation. In essence, therefore, the legal framework exists for dealing with land matters in the
event of oil discovery in any part of Uganda, namely: (i) compensation of individuals or communities
- 70 -

in whose land oil is discovered, (ii) resettlement of individuals or communities in other areas to
ensure safety from the vagaries of oil extraction, and (iii) providing for sharing oil proceeds in the
short, medium, and long terms. However, following the discovery of large deposits of oil in the
Western part of the country, it has become evident that the details of all these arrangements remain to
be worked out. For example, there are no provisions for oil related matters in the ongoing
consultations and drafting of the land policy, and a national resettlement policy remains to be
developed. Furthermore, land policy in Uganda is a politically sensitive issue and bound up with
regional and ethnic identity and politics.
V. PUBLIC INVESTMENT PLANNING
44.
Resource rich countries have often fallen into a resource trap in which gross domestic
income rises fast, while non resource related domestic output stagnates (see Collier and Goderis
2008). Uganda’s oil resources are a depletable resource, and consequently it is important for
sustainable development that the rents from resource extraction lead to income from other activities
as a means to overcome the resource trap. Therefore, the manner in which rents from oil are spent is
critically important. Public policy in general and public investment programs in particular need to
aim for the continuation of current non oil exports and facilitate the emergence of new export sectors
given that oil revenue is most likely not sufficiently abundant to provide a permanent income stream
(Page 2008).
45.
Resource and non resource rich countries are increasingly recognizing the importance
of public investment programs for building a more competitive and diversified economy. For
example, the new public investment management systems introduced by Chile and South Korea to
improve the efficiency of public investments have resulted in a more strategic selection of projects, a
higher degree of completion, greater transparency in the project cycle, and enhanced integration of
the capital and recurrent budgets.21 For the Government of Uganda to be able to prioritize public
investments, it is important to have in place an institutional rule based process, which requires proper
prior analysis of expected economic and social benefits of each public investment project.
46.
It will be important to assess how effective the existing Public Investment Management
system is in Uganda (see Box 1 on the various dimensions of public investment management
system) and to address its shortcoming before the oil revenue starts flowing into the Treasury
and the pressure to spend is there. Although some procedures are currently in place to guide the
preparation of investment projects, these are different across ministries, and capacity in ministries to
prepare, plan, and execute projects is weak. Not surprisingly, managing public investment is one of
the most challenging aspects of public finance, as these challenges span from planning, both at the
project and overall public investment budget level, to physical and financial execution of projects,
including procurement, monitoring, and evaluation of impact of investments. Integrating the use of
public private partnerships into the processes of selecting public investment projects is another
critical challenge. Government of Uganda has realized that its public investment management
system is in need of strengthening.
47.
It is expected that an assessment of the current public investment management system
will be undertaken this fiscal year and will lead to a comprehensive public investment
management action plan. The action plan is expected to be a mix of policy and process reform and

Annex 7: Youth Employment in Uganda
1.
In 2005/06, Uganda’s labor force amounted to nearly 11 million people, of which 26 percent
were less than 25 years old. Close to 400,000 youth enter the labor force every year. They face
challenges in transitioning to stable employment that generates earnings high enough to meet their
aspirations. This challenge is expected to grow with the projected increase in the number of youth to
close to eight million by 2015. Major constraints to youth’s transition to stable employment are:
(i) Poor skills. In 2005/06, about half of the youth entering the labor market did not complete
primary school. Opportunities in the non-farm sectors for those without complete primary
education are very limited, especially for women. Vocational skill training for those with
limited education is not widely available.
(ii) Poor opportunities leading to underemployment. Many adults are in stable but low
productivity employment; but, especially in rural areas, they report working less than 40
hours a week, so they are underemployed. Nationally, 12 percent of the labor force is in this
category, as is 20 percent of youth, especially youth in agricultural households.
(iii) High expectations. Many of Africa’s youth expect white-collar wage and salary jobs
although most youth are not qualified and such jobs are scarce. Although Uganda grew at 12
percent per annum between 2003 and 2006, private wage jobs accounted for just 10 percent
of total employment in 2006. Few youth graduate from school ready to create a business in
Uganda’s rapidly growing informal sector; and most youth do not desire employment in
agriculture, despite its commercial potential.
2.
Structural factors such as the education deficit, the pace of economic development and
demographic challenges (the labor force grows at 3 percent per annum), imply the problem of youth
absorption into the labor market will remain a challenge for the medium term. However, measures
can be taken to reduce the costs of youth transition to work. This requires both demand and supply
side interventions that help youth’s transition to stable employment, taking cognizance of the
characteristics of Uganda’s labor market in general and its youth in particular.
(i) Develop and implement polices to improve employment opportunities throughout the
economy and labor market in the wage sector. Uganda’s NDP focuses on creating
employment in small, medium, and large firms. Youth will benefit from these opportunities.
The NDP also focuses on improving opportunities in agriculture through more capital and
technology. If these initiatives are successfully implemented, youth with some education
should be well-placed to take up the opportunities created in the agriculture sector and earn
an adequate income.
(ii) Encourage non-farm self employment. Self employment in the informal sector has
enormous potential for the economy. This sector has been the source of many productive
opportunities with ability to provide stable employment and solid earnings. The number of
non-farm household enterprises grew at an average of 8.6 percent per annum between 1992
and 2005. At this rate, approximately 25 percent of new jobs between 2015 and 2020 will be
created in this sector. However, nearly 50 percent of household non-farm enterprises fail in
their first three years. New entrants in this sector face high uncertainties and some may
obtain lower income than they aspire. Strategies to increase opportunities and reduce risks

- 73 -

are needed in this sector as part of overall strategies for local economic development.
Increasing access to low cost banking services plays a key role.
(iii) Support youth in their transition to employment through programs that help youth
identify opportunities and find support. Evaluation studies are ongoing for some projects in
Uganda supported by the World Bank and non-state actors that have potential in this regard.
3.
The strategy for this CAS includes supply side interventions to address the skills
development and demand side interventions geared towards continued creation of private wage jobs,
entrepreneurship training, supporting household enterprises in the non-farm sector to increase their
incomes, increasing productivity in agriculture, public works and community programs that help
youth identify opportunities and find support. Some of the on-going projects and AAA that address
this issue and programs planned for the CAS are listed below.
4.
Analyze constraints faced by youth in making the transition to work and identify most
effective approaches to address these constraints.

Annex 13: CAS Consultations
1.
The World Bank carried out CAS consultations with stakeholders in Kampala in
December 2009 and March 2010. The stakeholders emphasized a role for the Bank in addressing
the following challenges: commercialization of agriculture, infrastructure development, skills gaps,
population growth, youth unemployment, and governance and anti-corruption.
2.
Private sector representatives emphasized the difficult business environment due to high
power tariffs, lack of effective transport opportunities, corruption, and the lack of skilled labor.
Participants advised the Bank to focus on infrastructure, commercialization of agriculture, and
improved access to finance. On the knowledge agenda, the private sector would welcome research on
low-cost power generation, migration, and measures to improve vocational skills training and literacy
skills. Further, the private sector would welcome a tougher stance on governance and anti-corruption.
3.
Civil society organizations (CSOs) highlighted the following key issues: education and
technical skills, youth unemployment, urbanization and associated challenges, infrastructure
development and regional inequalities. Representatives would welcome a more prominent Bank role
in oil management, governance issues, support to commercialization of agriculture and land reform,
and access to energy for all. The Bank was also encouraged to provide more information about
projects, enhance its communication strategy, and involve CSOs as partners in promoting the value
for money agenda. Representatives recommended that the Bank should maintain focus on poverty
reduction and apply more conditionality in its dialogue with the government.
4.
Government representatives recommended that the Bank focus on transport infrastructure,
including railways, energy, and the commercialization of agriculture. The Bank was encouraged to
assist the government in addressing the demographic challenge, youth unemployment, and
reproductive health. Participants emphasized the importance of the value for money agenda to reduce
waste and corruption in service delivery, supporting vocational and technical skills training, tackling
rapid urbanization, supporting regional trade, and addressing gender inequalities. Some participants
were of the view that the Bank should be more selective and focus on infrastructure.
5.
Members of Parliament encouraged the Bank to provide support to commercialization of
agriculture, energy infrastructure, education including vocational training, addressing the
demographic challenge, and knowledge products in the area of employment. They recommended that
the Bank focus its lending on a few sectors. Finally, they highlighted the need to ensure equity
amongst project beneficiaries and encouraged support to Parliament to strengthen its oversight role.
6.
Development partners recommended a strengthened Bank role in the following areas:
financial services, commercialization of agriculture and land issues, population and employment
generation, good governance and public sector management, health and climate change. In addition,
they recommended that the Bank contribute to analytical work highlighting how DP interventions
contribute to alleviate bottlenecks towards achievement of the MDGs.
7.
Country team governance consultations recommended using projects as entry points to
enhance governance in sectors and piloting interventions on enhanced transparency and third party
monitoring. The country team emphasized the need to be modest in expectations given the political
economy challenges, upcoming elections, potential for government to be less responsive to advice
given prospects of oil, continued weaknesses in institutions, and limited citizen engagement.

Annex 19: CAS Completion Report

Period Covered: FY2006‐FY2009
Document Date of the 2005‐2009 UJAS: December 14, 2005
Board Approval Date: January 17, 2006
CAS Completion Report by: Kasper Dalsten (AFMUG) and Jonas I. Parby (AFCTZ)

E XECUTIVE S UMMARY
1.
The CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) covers the four­year FY2006­09 Uganda Joint
Assistance Strategy (UJAS). The UJAS was aligned with the five pillars of the Government of
Uganda’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan (2004): i. economic management; ii. enhancing
production, competitiveness and incomes; iii. security, conflict‐resolution and disaster‐
management; iv. good governance; and v. human development.
2.
Of the 15 PEAP/UJAS high­level strategic objectives included in the CAS results
framework, three were achieved, eight were partially achieved, three were not achieved, and
for one strategic objective it was not possibly to assess progress. Bank contributions to the
achievement of the strategic objectives were rated satisfactory in four cases, moderately satisfactory
in another four cases, moderately unsatisfactory in six cases, and unsatisfactory in one case.
Therefore, Bank contributions to achievement of strategic objectives included in the CAS is rated
moderately satisfactory.
3.
While Bank interventions were generally implemented successfully, they did not
match the CAS program, which covered all five pillars of the PEAP, 15 strategic objectives, 40
outcomes, and 56 outcome indicators. In addition, the CAS results framework was never refined as
intended, thus lacking an operational framework for Bank contributions to the PEAP outcomes.
Consequently, the CAS suffered from lack of focus and from being over‐ambitious.
4.
The Bank delivered a larger lending program with fewer projects than projected in
the CAS. Apart from minor gaps in project preparation and supervision, the quality of project
implementation, outcomes and portfolio performance was generally satisfactory and cost effective.
The Bank delivered more IDA support to the energy, education and social protection sectors, and
less through PRSCs and to the transport sector than planned; however, this in part reflected the
Bank’s flexibility in responding to changing client priorities. While portfolio performance was
satisfactory, there is still room for improvement in addressing quality of project preparation,
addressing effectiveness delay issues, and ensuring efficient project implementation.
5.
The Completion Report identifies a number of lessons learned to be taken into
account when formulating the next Country Assistance Strategy for Uganda. The most
important of these are the following:
i.

A joint strategy, elaborated with other development partners, is neither a necessary
nor a sufficient condition for more effective aid. Rather than spending resources on
elaborating a joint strategy, efforts should be devoted to developing an operational
framework for alignment with the national development strategy, allowing for dynamic
changes, and for harmonization and coordination amongst development partners. The Joint
Budget Support Framework (JBSF), and the GoU’s Aid Policy currently under formulation,
are examples of operational frameworks, although lack of government ownership may be a
challenge.
‐ 90 ‐

ii.

Full alignment with an incomplete and/or irrelevant national development strategy
should be avoided. A careful assessment of the completeness, ownership, and strategic
relevance of Uganda’s new National Development Plan should guide the formulation of the
next CAS for Uganda.

iii.

The impact of a CAS may be reduced in cases where there is no or limited selectivity.
The Bank should consider focusing its lending operations in a limited number of sectors.

iv.

Credible, concise and realistic results frameworks for the CAS and for individual
projects are essential for planning, monitoring and budgeting purposes, including realistic
targets for PRSCs with their relative short life‐cycle.

v.

Successful reforms depend on strong sector involvement and ownership. Therefore,
reforms supported under PRSCs should be linked to sector strategies or specific sector
investment operations. A corollary to this insight is that long term sector reform issues
should not be addressed exclusively through APLs or SILs. In addition, government
leadership is a prerequisite for effective reform in any sector.

vi.

The Bank should develop a country­focused set of actionable governance indicators
(e.g. compliance with rules and laws) for specific sectors to enable tracking of progress on
the governance and anti‐corruption (GAC) agenda in the next CAS.

vii.

Delays to effectiveness of lending operations have affected the performance of the
Bank portfolio negatively throughout the CAS period. These delays should be addressed
by ensuring early involvement of relevant stakeholders, including Parliament, at project
design and appraisal stages.

6.
Box 1 below summarizes performance of the Bank and the Government over the CAS
implementation period.
Box 1: Bank and Government Performance during Uganda CAS Implementation, FY2006­09
What did the Bank do well?
 Quality and impact of analytical work: ESWs (CEM, PERs) had significant impact as evidenced in policy
priorities of GoU and in subsequent lending operations.
 Supporting government reforms: sector dialogues led to reforms in some sectors (e.g. in roads,
education) but not in other sectors (e.g. health, agriculture).
 Using PRSCs to address policy reforms with cross sectoral importance.
 Post conflict development: the Bank played an important role in supporting GoU with post conflict
rehabilitation of northern Uganda.
 Portfolio performance relatively good and disbursements higher than the Africa region average.
What did the Bank not do well?
 Limited results focus: the Bank elaborated a joint assistance strategy in the spirit of the Paris
Declaration. But the CAS was of limited operational value because of a weak results framework. For
example, indicators were often irrelevant to planned Bank interventions; targets were too ambitious;
data for indicators was not available or not observed frequently enough to measure progress; or change
in indicators could not be attributed to Bank interventions.
 Limited selectivity: the Bank was engaged in almost all sectors of the PEAP. Alignment with the
government strategy does not imply that the Bank needs to have an active lending portfolio in all areas.
 Limited focus on the governance agenda: the Bank lacked a clear focus for interventions to address
governance challenges and did not make much progress on advancing public service reform, good
governance and accountability.

‐ 91 ‐

What did the Government do well?
 Maintenance of stability and growth: the Government managed to maintain macroeconomic stability
and continuous growth with prudent fiscal policies.
 Realignment of budget priorities towards infrastructure, in line with CEM and PER recommendations.
 Suggesting and pursuing policy reforms in complex areas, including the roads and energy sectors.
 Effectively achieved stability in northern Uganda.
What did the Government not do well?
 PEAP as planning tool: the Government did not use the third PEAP as the central framework for policy
making, budgeting, implementation and review in the CAS period.
 Limited results focus: no clear results framework to measure progress of PEAP implementation.
 Implementation challenges: lack of effective coordination and clear division of labor between main
actors (MoFPED, OPM, NPA) led to weak implementation of the PEAP.
 Inequality: the Government did not adequately address inequality, as evidenced by poverty headcounts
in the north and northeast.
 Effectiveness delays were a recurrent problem during the CAS period, mainly due to long parliamentary
approval processes and lack of sufficient consultations between the Bank, relevant government
institutions and Parliament.

I NTRODUCTION

7.
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CAS CR) assesses the
effectiveness of the FY2006­09 Joint Assistance Strategy for the Republic of Uganda (Report
No. 34310‐UG; December 14, 2005), henceforth referred to as the UJAS when covering the entire
Joint Assistance Strategy, or the CAS when referring to the Bank‐specific part of the UJAS.1
8.
The purpose of this report is to assess the overall performance of the UJAS and the Bank’s
contribution to development results in Uganda, and to present a set of lessons for future Bank
assistance to Uganda.
9.
The Uganda CAS for FY2006­09 consists of a joint part (the UJAS) and a Bank Group
specific assistance program. This Completion Report considers achievements against both parts.
At the time of drafting the Joint Assistance Strategy, UJAS partners consisted of five bilateral
development partners (Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK), the African
Development Bank, and the World Bank Group. Subsequently, in 2006, another five development
partners (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, the European Commission) signed up to the UJAS.
10.
There was no CAS Progress Report (PR). UJAS partners did not prepare a Joint CAS PR
because of limited interest in re‐opening the UJAS to lengthy re‐negotiations. Bank staff considered
preparing a Bank‐specific CAS PR in FY08 and early FY09, but decided against it on the basis that a
new CAS would be prepared in FY09, leaving little time between the two documents. However, the
Government eventually delayed the preparation of the NDP by two years, thereby delaying the CAS.
In hindsight, the Bank should have prepared a CAS PR regardless of the timing in order to sharpen
the results framework and realign Bank interventions.
1 The main sources for the Completion Report are the following: i. the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Uganda
Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE), 2001‐07 (Report No. 49395, dated August 11, 2009); ii. the UJAS Review (report
financed by the UK Department for International Development, DFID; final report dated January 20, 2009); iii.
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) and Implementation Completion Reports (ICR); iv. IEG reviews of ICRs; v. the draft
Country Results Management Review (CRMR); vi. the Evaluation of the Implementation of the Paris Declaration in Uganda
(Office of the Prime Minister, Uganda, May 2008); vii. the Independent Evaluation of Uganda’s Poverty Eradication Action
Plan (Oxford Policy Management, July 2008); and viii. inputs from the Uganda Country Team.

‐ 92 ‐

11.
The PEAP, the UJAS, and the Bank specific assistance program had inadequate results
frameworks. The UJAS took the principle of strategy alignment with the national planning
framework too far. Full alignment with (a sub‐set of) an inadequate PEAP results framework meant
that also the UJAS results framework was inadequate, as outlined in more detail in paragraphs 23‐
25 below. With an unclear results framework for Bank interventions and attributions, the
evaluation of performance in this Completion Report has had to deviate from simple comparisons
of status with targets and an assessment of attribution, as baselines, targets, status of indicators,
and planned interventions are often unclear from the CAS results framework.
12.

II.

The remainder of this report is organized as follows:


Part II outlines Uganda’s long term development objectives and the alignment of the
UJAS/CAS with those objectives.



Part III reports on progress towards PEAP/UJAS outcomes and assesses to which
extent progress can be attributed to Bank interventions.



Part IV assesses Bank portfolio performance over the CAS period.



Part V summarizes lessons learned and highlights issues that should be addressed in
the new CAS for Uganda.

U GANDA ’ S L ONG T ERM D EVELOPMENT O BJECTIVES

13.
Three successive Poverty Eradication Action Plans (PEAPs, Uganda’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, PRSP) have guided the Government of Uganda’s (GoU’s) policies since 1997. The
first PEAP (PEAP‐97), pre‐dating the series of PRSPs, covered the period 1997‐2000. The revision
in 2000, the PEAP‐00, covered the period 2000‐03, while the third, PEAP‐04, initially covered the
period FY2005‐08, but was extended first to the end of FY09 and subsequently to the end of FY10.
14.
The UJAS, as well as the Bank Group specific assistance program, were both aligned
with the five pillars of the PEAP­04: i. economic management; ii. enhancing production,
competitiveness and incomes; iii. security, conflict‐resolution and disaster‐management; iv. good
governance; and v. human development.
15.
While the long term strategic goals for Uganda have not changed per se since the UJAS was
prepared, the 2004 PEAP became increasingly irrelevant in the political landscape since the
elections in 2006. The three successive PEAPs were all formulated in a no‐party environment.
Since the 2006 multiparty elections, the Government has increasingly measured its own success
against objectives set out in the National Resistance Movement (NRM) manifesto (launched in
January 2006) and against sector specific policies and plans.
16.
In retrospect, the PEAPs and the UJAS should have focused more on productive
sectors. While the two first PEAPs provided adequate frameworks for poverty reduction in an
economy still recovering from an extended period of civil wars, further sustainable reductions in
poverty reduction are dependent on addressing binding constraints in the economy. This was
highlighted in the Country Economic Memorandum (2007) as well as in the PEAP evaluation
(2008).
17.
The PEAP­04 and the UJAS would have benefitted from earlier delivery of the Country
Economic Memorandum. The CEM was delivered in 2007, eleven years after the previous CEM for
Uganda. Thus, the Bank missed an opportunity to provide inputs for a better prioritized PRSP.
When several of the CEM conclusions began to be reflected in the national budgets, the PEAP
became increasingly irrelevant as the overall guiding framework for the budget.
‐ 93 ‐

18.
The UJAS was one of the first joint assistance strategies elaborated. UJAS partners
deserve credit for effectively bringing together a majority of the most important development
partners in Uganda in an attempt to improve aid effectiveness by strengthening harmonization
between partners as well as alignment with the PEAP. However, the UJAS was centered on three
principles, which were at best only partially realized.2 In hindsight, therefore, the UJAS could be
said to be premature. For example, while the UJAS outlined joint development partner
commitments and aspirations to work more effectively towards the achievement of the PEAP goals
and objectives, the UJAS was not effective as an operational tool during implementation. Further,
the extended deliberation period, and associated transaction costs, meant that the UJAS was
practically dated by the time it was published, by being fully aligned with a national development
strategy which had lost its relevance. The expected complications associated with a revision of the
UJAS meant that it was never revised in light of the changed environment. There was also some
disappointment on DP side that GoU showed limited interest in engaging with UJAS partners over
UJAS implementation and other efforts towards improved aid effectiveness. In practice, therefore,
the joint strategy had limited operational importance amongst partners, and—according to the
UJAS review—appears not to have reduced transaction costs associated with aid on either GoU or
development partner side.
19.
The UJAS was weak in its analysis of political economy issues and in outlining
credible responses to poor governance. The joint analysis and joint risk assessment point to
rampant corruption and state that “[t]he Government has failed to successfully prosecute a single
high­profile case of corruption…”. At the time of drafting, UJAS partners were well aware that
increased political patronage could undermine the effective implementation of the PEAP. Yet, the
UJAS response amounts to little more than dialogue, capacity building, and strengthening of public
financial management and procurement processes. Elaborating a systematic approach to dealing
with governance risks within the Bank’s mandate may also have been hampered by the decision to
formulate a joint strategy with agencies having different mandates from the Bank.
20.
The UJAS outlined joint financing scenarios (low case, base case, high case) intended to
provide a coordinated response to, for example, GoU failure to improve governance and public
financial management, based on a UJAS assessment framework. The assessment framework,
however, depended on the annual PEAP Review which never transpired as intended, partly because
of the PEAP’s incomplete results framework. Consequently, the joint financing scenarios were
never implemented as intended, as demonstrated by three UJAS partners’ decisions to divert
assistance away from budget support in response to the 2006 elections.
21.
The Bank’s lending program was generally relevant to Uganda’s officially stated long
term development objectives. As would be anticipated, projects delivered towards the end of the
CAS period were increasingly not foreseen at the time the CAS was drafted (see Figure 4 on page
113). More importantly, projects delivered deviated from planned projects, cf. Figure 1 and Figure
2 below, where commitments are broken down by pillar and by sector board.3 Thus,
i.

PRSCs were reduced from $600m to $460m. Combined with the increase in the overall
program from $1,000m to $1,287m, PRSC’s share of overall new lending in the period
declined from the planned 60 percent to 36 percent;

2 The three strategic principles for the UJAS are: i. a country‐owned and country‐led PEAP [in hindsight not the case]; ii.
more effective collaboration among development partners [realized] and with the government [not realized as witnessed
by GoU’s limited appetite for engaging with UJAS partners]; iii. focus on results and outcomes [never realized given the
inadequate and poorly monitored PEAP results framework].
3 The base‐case lending program for the CAS included a number of projects with no allocations (see CAS Annex B3, p. 91).
Therefore, some “new” operations, such as the NUSAF‐2 project, were in fact anticipated at the time of CAS formulation,
only under another name and with no indicative allocation.

‐ 94 ‐

ii.

delivered commitments under pillar 2 almost doubled to $470m compared to the plan
($260m), mainly due to the new $300m Power Sector Development project and delays to
planned road projects;

iii.

NUSAF‐2 ($100m) was not anticipated and explains the difference between planned and
delivered projects under pillar 3/social protection;

iv.

delivered commitments under pillar 4 were reduced as the Public Service Performance
Enhancement (UPSPEP) project was reduced from $70m to $23m;

v.

the non‐planned $150m Post‐Primary Education and Training (UPPET) project explains the
significant increase in delivered commitments under pillar 5/education.

Note: Technically, PRSCs are under the Public Sector Governance Board. However, due to the prominent role of PRSCs in the
lending program in Uganda, PRSCs are presented as a separate category.

22.
This deviation between planned and delivered commitments could be interpreted in
different ways: with GoU priorities changing, the Bank was merely responding to client demands;
the change in client demands was a response to a highly relevant non­lending program; or the
deviation could be an indirect response to what was perceived as an increasingly inadequate CAS.
While flexibility in the lending program may have been the second‐best response to an inadequate
CAS, the absence of a formal realignment of the CAS in response to a CAS Progress Report meant
that interventions delivered in the latter part of the CAS period lacked a strategic framework
guiding interventions. Having said that, all of the projects delivered were aligned with the strategic
objectives included in the CAS.

III.

P ROGRESS A GAINST CAS O UTCOMES

23.
The assessment in this section focuses on progress against the outcome indicators
and intermediate results outlined in the UJAS (Appendix 1 of the CAS: World Bank specific
program). The PEAP Results and Policy Matrix was organized around the five pillars mentioned
above, 15 strategic objectives, 51 outcomes, and 76 outcome indicators. The World Bank specific
program of the UJAS was directly aligned with 15 of these strategic objectives, 40 of the outcomes,

‐ 95 ‐

and 56 of the outcome indicators.4 In addition, the Bank specific program included a number of
qualitative and quantitative intermediate results, which are a sub‐set of policy actions in the PEAP
Result and Policy matrix. With these limitations in mind, Annex 1 provides a summary of progress
against the 56 indicators included in the Bank specific program.
24.
Assessing progress against CAS outcomes posed two main challenges: i. the PEAP results
matrix was never completed; ii. the Bank specific program did not provide a clear link between
interventions and results. Baselines and/or targets were missing for at least 31 indicators (41%) in
the PEAP. Alignment with an incomplete framework meant that also the CAS results matrix was
incomplete. In addition, there was no clear link from Bank interventions and strategies/actions to
anticipated intermediate results and progress on the outcome indicators. Because the indicators
chosen were those of the PEAP, attribution of Bank interventions could not always be assessed.5
25.
The Bank specific part of the UJAS recognized the lack of an adequate results framework
against which the contribution of Bank interventions to PEAP outcomes could be assessed.6 Yet, the
UJAS results framework was never refined as intended. With those limitations in mind, the
following sections consider to which extent Bank interventions during implementation of the UJAS
contributed to the outcomes as intended.
26.
Bank contributions to the achievement of the strategic objectives were rated satisfactory in
four cases, moderately satisfactory in another four cases, moderately unsatisfactory in six cases, and
unsatisfactory in one case. Therefore, Bank contributions to achievement of strategic objectives
included in the CAS is rated moderately satisfactory. A summary of CAS outcomes and Bank
contributions is provided in Box 2.
Box 2: Highlights of CAS Outcomes and Bank Achievements by Pillar
Pillar 1: Macroeconomic Stability Consistent with Rapid Private­Sector Led Growth: Satisfactory
 Macroeconomic stability continued to improve during the CAS period, following the trends of the
preceding decade. Almost all targets were achieved. Growth rates remained high throughout the period,
the fiscal deficit was reduced beyond target, government revenues increased slightly, and credit to the
private sector increased.
 Policy dialogue, mainly through the PRSC instruments, and robust recommendations from analytical
work successfully contributed to a prudent fiscal and overall sound macroeconomic policy framework.
Pillar 2: Enhancing Production, Competitiveness, and Incomes: Moderately Satisfactory
 Limited progress was made towards the outcome of increased private sector competitiveness, although
access to micro‐finance increased significantly.
 The lack of a clear policy, strategic and institutional framework for the agriculture sector hampered
overall progress, despite the Bank’s contributions to research and advisory services.
 Road infrastructure improved and the Bank played a major role in establishing the Road Development
Fund, which is essential for sustainability of road sector investments. Access to electricity more than

The results matrix for the Bank specific program of the UJAS has in some instances listed outcomes as strategic
objectives rather than following the distinction between strategic objectives and outcomes in the PEAP results
framework. While the one‐to‐one relationship between indicators in the PEAP and the UJAS is maintained, headings and
groupings in Annex 1 differ slightly from Appendix 1 of the CAS.
5 The targets that were specified in the PEAP were for FY08. With full alignment of the results framework, UJAS targets
were also for FY08, even though the UJAS covered FY2006‐09. Dates for status of indicators are provided in Annex 1. In
any case, it is the trend in indicators, rather than specific value in a single year, that matters for an assessment of progress
towards targets as outlined in the PEAP/UJAS.
6 UJAS, Part 2, paragraph 20: “In operationalizing the UJAS, the Bank in collaboration with the government and other
development partners will further refine its results framework presented in appendix 1. This framework will establish a
more direct link between specific PEAP goals to government–led outcomes, and the contribution of Bank outputs to these
outcomes.” [Emphasis added].

doubled, but still only 8% of Ugandan households have access to mains power.
 Management of natural resources did not improve. Deforestation, depletion of fish stock and declining
soil fertility remain major challenges.
Pillar 3: Security, Conflict­Resolution, and Disaster­Management: Satisfactory
 The negative socio‐economic effects of the conflict in northern Uganda were reduced significantly due to
the cessation of Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) hostilities. This is reflected in the reduced number of
casualties from conflict, the reduced number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and the increase in
the number of former rebels and their collaborators resettled, having received amnesty.
 Uganda has a strengthened policy framework to address conflicts and disputes as well as regional
disparities as reflected in the Peace Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP) and the Karamoja
Integrated Disarmament and Development Plan (KIDDP).
 The Bank played a major role towards these achievements, mainly through interventions availing access
to improved social services for almost half the population of IDPs in northern Uganda.
Pillar 4: Good Governance: Moderately Unsatisfactory
 Uganda has not witnessed progress in terms of tackling corruption, improving public sector
management or improving the justice sector, with almost all indicators showing lower scores compared
with the baseline year. Policy dialogue under the PRSC process as well as Bank‐funded operations were
not able to provide significant momentum to the public service reform agenda, including good
governance and reduction of corruption.
Pillar 5: Human Development: Moderately Satisfactory
 In the education sector, indicators on enrollment and coverage show improvements, but major
challenges remain with respect to completion rates.
 Uganda has seen some progress in fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria, increasing immunization rates and in
reducing infant mortality. However, the health sector still faces significant challenges, as witnessed by
high maternal and child mortality rates.
 Coverage and access to water and sanitation have increased, but at a slower speed compared to earlier
periods.

27.
The World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and the Operations Evaluation
Department of the African Development Bank produced a Joint Country Assistance Evaluation
(CAE) dated March 19, 2009, covering the period 2000 to 2007. The CAE assessed Bank support to
Uganda under the FY01‐03 World Bank Country Assistance Strategy and the first two years of the
UJAS. Main findings of the CAE are provided in Box 3.
Box 3: Uganda Joint Country Assistance Evaluation, 2001­2007
According to the CAE, the World Bank programs were effective in the areas of decentralization, public sector
reform, growth and economic transformation, education, and water and sanitation. IEG found that more
could have been done to help counter the perception of increasing corruption, improve power supply, reduce
transport costs, enhance agricultural productivity, and help with family planning and reproductive health.
The CAE rated the overall outcome of World Bank support moderately satisfactory.
IEG Recommendations:
 Support GoU in developing an analytical framework to guide governance reforms.
 Encourage and support GoU efforts to develop medium‐to‐long term master plans for infrastructure.
 Encourage GoU to coordinate ongoing monitoring and evaluation initiatives by its development
partners in order to secure reliable monitoring and evaluation of its overall poverty reduction strategy.
 Reinforce the effectiveness of general budget support as an instrument for minimizing transaction costs
and facilitating the use of country systems.

The remainder of Section III assesses performance against CAS outcomes. Normally, such
an assessment would evaluate performance outcome by outcome. However, with 40 outcomes and
56 outcome indicators, such an approach would lose sight of the bigger picture. The performance
assessment is therefore organized around the five pillars and 15 strategic objectives, with reference
made to specific outcomes and outcome indicators where this is relevant. A complete overview of
performance by outcome indicator is provided in Annex 1.

PILLAR 1: ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
29.
Fiscal consolidation, macroeconomic stability, and significant debt relief helped foster an
environment conducive to a growing private sector. While challenges remain, the strategic
objective was generally achieved. The single strategic objective was highly relevant for the country
and as a prerequisite for the success of other Bank interventions.

30.
While it is difficult to attribute macro‐level effects to specific Bank interventions, it is fair to
say that the Bank contributed positively and satisfactory to the relatively good performance under
Pillar 1. Policy dialogue in connection with the PRSC series entailed agreement with GoU on the
MTEF, annual budget executions were closely monitored, and Poverty Action Fund (PAF)
expenditures consistently exceeded 95 percent of appropriations (although public administration
expenditures exceeded the budget). Further, PRSC prior actions underpinned public financial
management reforms, as further detailed in Box 4.
Box 4: The PRSC Series in Uganda
The World Bank has been applying Poverty Reduction Support Credits in Uganda since 2001. While the
PRSC1‐3 series mainly focused on poverty reduction through human development improvements, PRSC4‐7
increasingly focused on supporting the growth agenda as a means to reduce poverty. PRSC4‐7 thus focused
more on macroeconomic management, public financial management reforms, reforms to improve the
business environment for the private sector, and reforms for increased efficiency in service delivery.
The PRSCs supported an expansion of service delivery and led to an increase in poverty‐reducing
expenditures. The expansion was largely pro‐poor and equitable, but was offset by poor quality of service
delivery, governance and human resource challenges, and limited impact on outcome indicators. However,
the PRSCs proved useful for addressing cross‐cutting issues, which explains the expansion of the PRSCs’
policy action agenda.
Despite the above achievements, providing assistance through PRSCs in Uganda also entailed a number of
challenges. For example, PRSCs did not facilitate governance reform, as the direct links between Bank
support and outcomes were not clear, as evidenced in disconnects between short term prior actions and long
term objectives. Further, the PRSCs proved inadequate in dealing with specific health sector issues, for
example addressing human resource management issues as an impediment to effective service delivery.
Therefore, long term sector reforms are often better addressed simultaneously by development policy
lending and a sector specific operation supported by the Bank or another development partner.
The use of a results matrix as a performance framework has tended to create contradictory incentives. The
GoU sought to establish modest performance targets (especially with respect to governance), while the Bank
would push for more ambitious targets. This led to dialogue giving too much attention to the details of the
assessment process rather than policy reform dialogue.
Finally, PRSCs suffered from a lack of clear and measurable outcomes, and an often rather weak connection
between policy actions and monitorable indicators in the PRSC matrices themselves. These challenges should
be addressed under the new PRSC8‐10 series.

As outlined in Table 2, progress on outcome indicators were generally met save for a few
exceptions. Targets were all realistic if not slightly unambitious in some instances.

32.
While the fiscal deficit was reduced to 5.1 percent of GDP, this was largely a result of poor
performance related to government expenditure as well as revenue mobilization. Government
revenues reached only 12.8 percent of GDP, against the rather unambitious target of 13.2 percent of
GDP by 2007/08. While tax administration has been modernized, low revenue mobilization
remains a challenge. The largely informal local business sector remains outside the scope of tax
collections and the majority of taxes collected are still trade related. Government expenditures were
reduced beyond target, largely as a result of limited absorption capacity hampering the planned
increase in development spending.
33.
Although core CPI inflation reached 12.1 percent by end June 2008, and the average for
FY08 reached 7.3 percent, this was largely attributed to the domestic energy crisis exacerbated by
high international commodity prices, and core CPI inflation had reduced to less than six percent by
early 2010. The fiscal stance and prudent monetary policy kept inflation at reasonable levels
without crowding out private sector finance. Credit to the private sector increased to 11.2 percent
of GDP against a target of 10.4 percent by the end of FY08. The growth in private sector lending is
attributed to prudent monetary and fiscal policies as well as increased competition in the financial
sector. External debt was reduced to 46.7 percent of exports, easily surpassing the target of 238
percent, largely due to debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives. Since MDRI, government
borrowing has been underpinned by a Debt Strategy (2007) underscoring fiscal consolidation and
limits new borrowing to concessional terms, except for infrastructure development.
34.
Policy dialogue, mainly through the PRSC instruments, and robust recommendations from
analytical work have contributed to a continued prudent fiscal and macroeconomic policy
framework in Uganda. Focus on spending on public administration, efficiency in use of public
resources highlighted by the PERs, and improving procedures for public procurement, to an extent
helped curtail expansion of spending in non‐productive areas. Re‐orientation of the budget
towards addressing infrastructure constraints is attributed to the CEM and the PER on fiscal policy
for growth. According to the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (2006), Bank support to the URA
Customs Modernization Program (under the East Africa Trade and Transportation Project) helped
improve efficiency, reduced the scope for corruption, and eased cargo tracking, exchange of
clearing information, and revenue collection. The Bank contributed to increased private sector
access to credit through the Second Private Sector Competitiveness project (PSCP‐2). This project
provided technical assistance, training, information campaigns and support to business
development services via support to the Private Sector Foundation Unit.
35.
Progress on CAS outcomes under Pillar 1 are sustainable as witnessed by Uganda’s ability to
weather the impact of the global financial crisis. Future progress depends on Uganda’s ability to
address road and energy infrastructure bottlenecks in particular and how successful the value‐for‐

‐ 99 ‐

money in service delivery agenda is being pursued. The management of potentially significant
revenues from oil extraction poses an emerging challenge to macroeconomic stability.

PILLAR 2: ENHANCING PRODUCTION, COMPETITIVENESS, AND INCOMES
36.
Under Pillar 2 of the CAS, the Bank sought to contribute to seven strategic objectives and 14
outcomes, measured by 20 outcome indicators. Several indicators are missing baselines and/or
observations making it futile to assess performance based on the outcome indicators only. Rather,
an assessment of progress towards each strategic objective, and the Bank’s attribution, is provided
in the following.
37.
Most of the PEAP/UJAS strategic objectives were not achieved or only partially achieved.
Despite this, Bank interventions had a positive impact towards meeting the strategic objectives,
although links between interventions and outcomes and strategic objectives are not always clear.
Delays to effectiveness and implementation, poor follow‐up on lessons learned, inadequate
attention to institutional weaknesses and trying to achieve too much means that the Bank
contribution to the strategic objectives included in the Bank specific results matrix under Pillar 2 is
rated moderately satisfactory.7

Strategic Objective 2.1: Increased and more Efficient Private Sector Production
38.
Some progress was made towards increased private sector competitiveness. Private sector
investment rose only marginally, but value of exports exceed even its FY14 target. On this basis,
strategic objective 2.1 was partially achieved. Bank interventions were relatively successful, but
suffered from delays in implementation and did not quite match the ambitious agenda for Bank
contributions as set out under SO2.1. For example, absolute performance against the Ease of Doing
Business indicators improved only marginally, while relative performance gradually deteriorated.
On that basis, Bank contributions to SO2.1 are rated moderately satisfactory.
39.
Bank lending operations under SO2.1 consist of a Regional Trade Facilitation Project and
the Second Private Sector Competitiveness Project (PSCP2). The former successfully set up the
African Trade Insurance Agency, facilitating international trade by providing insurance against

Note that it is possible for the PEAP/UJAS strategic objective to not have been achieved, yet the Bank’s contribution
positive (MS or S), as long as the Bank’s contributions match the ambitions set out in the CAS. This apparent disconnect is
a result of “over‐alignment” with the PEAP results matrix and does not necessarily reflect poor Bank performance in the
individual operations.

political risks. The latter has, among other things, successfully contributed to improved GoU‐
private sector dialogue via the Presidential Investors’ Round Table. Other achievements include
support to the establishment of the land and company registries and the credit reference bureau.
Financial deepening efforts were further supported by the IFC’s mortgage support program.
40.
Non‐lending activities under SO2.1 included three major pieces: Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study (DTIS), Options for Strengthening the East African Community’s (EAC) Trade
Integration, and the Investment Climate Assessment. Common to these studies is that they need
closer review and follow‐up actions to achieve an impact. In addition to these analytic pieces, the
Bank provided on‐the‐ground advice to the GoU on private sector related issues. Among other
things, the Bank served as a member on the steering committee for a revision of the GoU’s Medium
Term Competitiveness Strategy.
Strategic Objective 2.2: Increased and more Efficient Agricultural Production
41.
The agriculture sector grew at an average annual rate of just 1.1 percent from FY03‐FY08,
significantly lower than the PEAP/UJAS target of +3.8 percent.8 While several other outcome
indicators with respect to agricultural output and land titling were formulated, these indicators
were not monitored and data are not readily available. On this basis, SO2.2 was not achieved.
42.
Bank interventions (the National Agricultural Advisory Services Project (NAADS), the
Second Agricultural Research and Training Project (ARTP2), and PRSC support to the Plan for
Modernization of Agriculture (PMA)), contributed towars policy reforms in the sector (fulfillment of
prior actions for the PRSC credits), sustaining a liberal trade and pricing policy, availing investment
resources, and provision of knowledge and advice. In particular, Bank interventions provided
support to the following intermediate results: i. establishment of the National Agricultural Research
System (NARS); and ii. Expansion of the NAADS program to cover all sub‐counties. Other aspects of
the agriculture agenda were addressed by other development partners (e.g. agricultural marketing,
livestock services, regulatory services, oilseeds development, rural roads, fisheries etc.) Thus,
despite the strategic objective not being achieved, Bank interventions largely delivered what they
set out to do. Consequently, Bank contribution to SO2.2 is rated moderately satisfactory.
43.
During the period, the Government pursued a liberal price and trade policy that supported
the agriculture sector. Domestic prices for agricultural and food products were in line with border
prices adjusted to marketing costs. In contrast to Kenya, where the state actively intervenes into
grain marketing through the National Cereal and Produce Board (NCPB), and to Tanzania, which
bans the export of maize, the trade policy in Uganda remained liberal, with the Government
pursuing outward‐oriented policies through and beyond the EAC customs union.
44.
A common weakness of the Bank’s interventions in the agriculture sector has been the lack
of a clear government policy framework regarding the roles of the public vs. the private sector and
overlaps in various programs. Initially, the PMA was the agreed framework for the PEAP. Over the
past couple of years, however, new initiatives for rural development have been introduced, namely
the Rural Development Strategy (RDS) and Prosperity for All (PFA). These programs have almost
identical objectives and overlapping mandates. In addition, recent government interference in the
sector may be motivated by political patronage considerations rather than ensuring the strategic
objective is met. With unclear and potentially parallel implementation arrangements, leading to
significant duplication of efforts and wastage of development resources, there is an urgent need for
the Government to clarify its policy and institutional framework to facilitate a coordinated
approach to meeting the strategic objective. Recognizing the need for a clear policy framework, the
8 The growth rate of the agriculture sector over the period is disputed. Whatever the correct growth rate is, it is likely to
be unimpressive and below the target of more than 3.8 percent per annum.

‐ 101 ‐

Bank, together with other development partners, is currently engaged with the Government to
address these concerns in the Development Strategy and Investment Plan (DSIP) for 2009‐2014.
45.
Non‐lending activities in support of SO2.2 consisted of the PER on Sustainable Land
Management and an Agriculture Sector PER. The findings of this analytical work has already been
feeding into the preparation of the next phase of support to National Agricultural Research
Organisation (NARO) and NAADS, preparation of a project with the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal
Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) to support core public functions, and the finalization of the DSIP.
46.
The major lessons to be learned for the next CAS are the following. First, despite the critical
role in supporting technology generation and dissemination, it is critical to support other core
mandates of MAAIF under the proposed DSIP, such as animal and plant disease control, regulatory
services, water for agricultural production, sector statistics and monitoring and evaluation, etc. to
support agricultural growth, including the desired impact of research and advisory services.
Second, cross‐sectoral support is required to enhance lasting agricultural growth. Better rural
roads, greater access to electricity and communication infrastructure, more and better marketing
infrastructure, and better access to finance in rural areas are urgently needed to complement
agriculture‐related policy and lending activities of the Bank. Third, an increasingly important factor
for agricultural development in Uganda is the recent surge in regional trade, notably with southern
Sudan and Kenya.9 Agro‐processing is another critical area for future support, but its success will
ultimately depend on whether concerted efforts on supporting rural infrastructure and private
sector development are made to enhance pro‐poor agricultural growth. Finally, for sustainable
impact in the agriculture sector, and to support commercialization of agriculture in Uganda, the
articulation of a clear policy, strategic and institutional framework is a must.
Strategic Objective 2.3: Increased and Sustainable Fisheries Production
47.
The fishery sector showed rapid growth rates with the value of fish exports increasing from
$88m in 2003 to $124m in 2008, after peaking at $146m in 2006. While no indicator is assessing
the objective of sustainable fisheries production, annual fish catch was 15% lower in 2007 than in
2004. This reflects the continued depletion of fish stocks as a result of overfishing and use of illegal
fishing gears that end up catching immature fish, which in turn undermines the sustainability of the
fishery sector and fish exports. On that basis, SO2.3 is only partially achieved.
48.
The PEAP/UJAS outcome indicators for SO2.3 were included in the Bank specific program,
but the Bank has had neither lending nor non‐lending operations supporting this objective over the
CAS period. The regional Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) closed at the
onset of the CAS and the follow‐on project, LVEMP‐2, will only become effective in FY10. This
demonstrates that CAS alignment with a government’s development plan should include a higher
degree of selectivity rather than uncritically copying objectives, outcomes and indicators.
Therefore, under this strategic objective, the CAS was neither relevant nor realistic, and Bank
contribution is rated unsatisfactory.
Strategic Objective 2.4: Increased and more Efficient Production of Non­agricultural
Goods and Services
49.
The PEAP/UJAS outcome indicators chosen to monitor progress against SO2.4 were mostly
inadequate. Several baselines, target values, and statuses are missing, making it difficult to evaluate
progress towards the outcomes, cf. Annex 1. That said, some progress was observed. Thus, the
number of tourists visiting Uganda increased by 65% over the period considered, thus exceeding
the target by a wide margin. Further, the contribution to GDP from mining and quarrying increased
by 33 percent in real terms over the period consider. On that basis, SO2.4 was partially achieved.
9

Uganda’s official exports to Sudan increased eleven‐fold from $22.7m in 2004 to $245.9m in 2008.

‐ 102 ‐

Bank interventions were fairly successful but suffered from slow implementation, partly as a result
of poor stakeholder participation at project design stage (PSCP‐2). Thus, the Bank’s contribution is
rated moderately unsatisfactory.
50.
Bank interventions consisted of three projects carried over from the previous CAS, the
PSCP‐2, the Protected Areas Management and Sustainable Use (PAMSU) project, and the
Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources Project (SMMRP). There were no non‐lending
activities in direct support of SO2.4 and no new lending operations were approved in the CAS
period under review.
51.
Achievements of the PSCP‐2 include the reduced time to register a property; reduced time
to register a business; new business registrations; and support to MSMEs under the Business
Uganda Development Scheme (BUDS). Other components are performing unsatisfactory, including
the Kampala Industrial Business Park, and monitoring of project implementation suffers from poor
availability of data on the chosen intermediate outcome indicators. The PAMSU project has
suffered significant delays in implementation but is showing progress towards objectives.
Development outcomes of the SMMRP are mostly satisfactory if delayed and the project faces
challenges over extension and additional financing, which was not yet approved by the end of FY09.
Strategic Objective 2.5: Strengthened Infrastructure in Support of Increased
Production of Goods and Services
52.
Bank support to infrastructure over the CAS period was aligned with outcome indicators for
road conditions, rural access to electricity, and freight carried by rail, cf. Annex 1. Limited progress
and some deterioration was registered, although the indicator for roads in good condition
fluctuates and improved in the latter period. Thus, SO2.5 was only partially achieved. Bank
interventions in the infrastructure sector were largely successful, but delays to implementation,
and timing and sequencing of interventions, could have been better. Bank contribution to SO2.5 is
thus rated moderately satisfactory.
53.
Bank interventions in the roads sector consisted of three phases of the Road
Development Program (RDP1‐3) amounting to $263m, the Road Sector and Institutional Support
Project (RSISP), and the East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (EATTFP). The RDPs
contributed to establish and/or upgrade a network of urban and rural roads, backed by analytical
work on the transport sector strategy, on environmental policy, and on management and financing.
Besides improving access to rural and economically productive areas, the RDPs contributed to a
reduction in average travel time and transport and vehicle‐operating costs.
Although
implementation of the RSISP has suffered from significant delays, the project has largely been
successful. Thus, Uganda National Roads Authority was established and operational as of July 1,
2008; the Road Fund Act was approved by Parliament in June 2008 and gazetted in October 2008;
and the role of the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) was redefined towards a regulatory
and planning body. The EATTFP contributed to the establishment of the EAC Customs Union and
reduced transit times for cargo traffic at border posts in the region.
54.
Bank interventions contributed to improvements in the roads sector. Despite this success, a
number of important lessons have been learned, notably with regards to the Adaptable Program
Loan (APL): i. with the RDP phases being implemented in parallel, it was not possible to incorporate
lessons learned from one phase in the design of the following; ii. intermediate triggers should be
defined in support of steps needed to implement the reform program; iii. establishment of new
institutions is a lengthy process; and iv. it proved difficult to agree with the Government on a
comprehensive long term reform program, calling into question the appropriateness of the APL
modality in this sector.

‐ 103 ‐

55.
In addition to the lessons learned, future Bank interventions in the roads sector should
explicitly seek to address the Government’s limited absorptive capacity in infrastructure
investments and address the relatively high unit costs of road construction and rehabilitation.
56.
The energy sector was the largest area of Bank interventions during the CAS period. Three
projects were carried over and are now closed or fully disbursed: the Power Project 4 (PP‐4), the
Energy for Rural Transformation Project (ERTP), and the Privatization and Utility Sector Reform
Project (PUSRP).10 The $300m Power Sector Development Project (PSDP) and the Bujagali Private
Power Generation guarantee were delivered in FY07.
57.
The PEAP recognized that energy supply is critical for production, competitiveness, and
incomes. In 2002/03, only 3% of Ugandan households in rural areas and 8% in urban areas had
access to grid electricity, while the rest relied on biomass and other renewable energy. Uganda has
large energy potential, notably hydroelectric power potential, and the Bank CAS supported the
Government’s strategy to develop new energy resources. Accordingly, operations (PUSRP) focusing
on improving the financial viability of the sector were implemented.
58.
In addition to financial viability of the sector, there was a strong focus on expanding the
quantity and quality of power (PP‐4, PSDO, Bujagali), as well as on increasing access (ERTP).
Strategically, the investments served to bolster Uganda's private sector led and commercially
oriented energy sector structure and supported both long term generation development (PP‐4 and
Bujagali) and interim generation (PSDP). The Bank collaborated closely with other members of the
Bank Group (IFC, MIGA) and other development partners. The Bank actively supported the
creation of an Energy Sector Working Group (with government and development partner
participants) and has sown the seeds for a coordinated, collaborative future investment program by
financing the preparation of a Sector Investment Plan.
59.
Achievements include the following: i. through the ERTP, the Bank introduced a cross‐
sectoral approach for access expansion, providing key stakeholders in the health, education, water,
agriculture, and local government sectors a direct role in planning and implementing their energy
investments; ii. the PP‐4 made major contributions to improve energy supply and strengthened the
borrower’s capacity to manage reform, privatization and development in the power and petroleum
sub sectors; iii. PUSRP contributed to an improved regulatory framework and investments in the
distribution network are taking place. In addition, initiatives to reduce technical and non‐technical
power losses were launched; iv. PSDP successfully contributed to the significant reduction in power
rationing, in light of delays to the Bujagali dam; v. the Bujagali hydro power project is expected to
provide least‐cost power generation capacity that will eliminate power shortages at the time of its
commissioning.11
60.
Looking forward, the key area of emphasis will be access expansion and the generation and
transmission investments needed to support it. There will also be an increased focus on regional
aspects of energy development, including regional interconnections as part of the emerging East
Africa power market, and also assessment of domestic generation as it relates to the regional
market.
61.
The main lessons learned are that policy reforms should not be combined with SILs as this
tends to delay project implementation. An example is inclusion of sector reforms in PP‐4 leading to
commitments beyond the control of the implementing agency, such as the completion time of the
Bujagali hydro power project, and reduction of distribution network losses. These sector reform
issues would be better addressed under the PRSC policy dialogues. From ERTP, general lessons

‐ 104 ‐

learned include the need for assessment of potential private sector investments in rural energy as
well as taking into account institutional capacity of implementing agencies at the project design
stage.
62.
Bank interventions in the railway sector consisted of two IFC loans ($10m and $22m) to
Rift Valley Railways (RVR) to finance capital expenditures for the rehabilitation, operation, and
maintenance of the railway. The IFC has also acted as an advisor to the Governments of Kenya and
Uganda regarding privatization of the joint Kenya‐Uganda railway line (see also paragraph 155).
However, since RVR has experienced severe financial and operational difficulties as a result of
mismanagement, and the much poorer than expected condition of rolling stock and tracks,
disbursement of the larger of the two IFC loans is pending restructuring of RVR. These activities
will carry over to the new CAS and results will only be realized then.
Strategic Objective 2.6: Strengthened Environment and Natural Resource (ENR)
Management Regime in Support of Sustainable Production of Goods and Services
63.
Incomplete data on baselines, target values and status makes it impossible to assess to
which extent SO2.6 was achieved. Bank interventions did contribute to their stated objectives.
However, with none of the PEAP/UJAS indicators monitored and with the ENR sector‐wide
approach (SWAp) dropped, Bank contribution to SO2.6 is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
64.
Bank lending operations in support of SO2.6 consisted of the Protected Areas Management
and Sustainable Use Project (PAMSU) and the Second Environmental Management and Capacity
Building Project (EMCBP‐2). Both projects were carried over from previous CASs and both were
extended, with EMCBP‐2 receiving additional financing. Bank interventions did contribute to the
strengthening of institutional capacity of the main regulatory bodies in the ENR sector including
NEMA, UWA and UWEC. The Bank also contributed to the preparation and launching in 2008 of the
ENR Sector Investment Plan. However, the ENR SWAp was dropped because of little interest from
the Government.
65.
Lending operations were planned to be complemented by analytical work on the linkage
between natural resource management, growth and poverty reduction in Uganda; however, this
ESW was never finalized and thus had negligible impact.
66.
A major lesson learned is that environmental issues and concerns, including climate change,
are closely linked to sustainable natural resource management. In the rush to get quick results
from national development efforts, this factor is normally relegated to a secondary issue. To be
effective and achieve the desirable results, sustainable ENR programs need better integration in
other development efforts to have the desired impact.
Strategic Objective 2.7: Strengthened Financial Sector in Support of Increased
Production of Goods and Services
67.
Micro finance institutions (MFIs) served 4.3m clients in 2008, almost a five‐fold increase
over just five years. The single outcome indicator under SO2.7 thus exceeded the target and, by that
measure, the objective was achieved. Bank interventions actively supported SO2.7 and are thus
rated satisfactory.
68.
Bank lending operations in support of SO2.7 consisted of PSCP‐2 (see paragraphs 34, 51).
Non‐lending operations in support of a strengthened financial sector included a number of studies
related to remittances, strengthening of the financial sector and associated reforms. These enabled
stakeholders to focus on policy issues and provide a framework on the way forward. For example,
work is being done to reform the pension sector and the anti money laundering bill is being tabled
to Parliament.

PILLAR 3: SECURITY, CONFLICT‐RESOLUTION AND DISASTER‐MANAGEMENT
69.
Under the single strategic objective under Pillar 3, the Bank aimed at contributing to two
outcomes measured by three outcome indicators. Most indicators did not have any baseline values,
but with targets indicating trends only, it was still possible to assess progress.
70.
Improvement in the security situation in northern Uganda was reflected in progress on all
outcome indicators under Pillar 3. The number of IDPs was reduced by 66% (almost 1.2m people
returned from IDP camps), the number of casualties as a result of the conflict was reduced, 95% of
former rebels and their collaborators were resettled (having received amnesty) and economic
activity in formerly conflict affected areas increased. Consequently, the strategic objective under
Pillar 3 was achieved. Bank support under Pillar 3, while aided by positive external factors, was
successful in supporting improved livelihoods, the return of IDPs, and reintegration of ex‐
combatants. Therefore, Bank contribution under pillar 3 was assessed as satisfactory.

71.
Bank Support under Pillar 3 consisted of both lending and non‐lending products, the key
projects being the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) project and support to Amnesty
Commission through the Multi‐country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP). The
key non‐lending products were the Northern Uganda PER and a study on northern Uganda on
“Land Policy and the Return to Peace”.
72.
Given the importance of external factors in achieving the outcomes, it is difficult to attribute
progress to Bank interventions. Nonetheless, it should be acknowledged that Bank alignment of the
CAS with Pillar 3 of the PEAP was highly relevant and timely.
73.
The support provided to the Uganda Amnesty Commission through the Bank‐managed
Multi‐Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP) contributed to the return of
former rebels to civilian life. The Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) was able to allocate
resources increasingly to areas where displaced people (IDPs) returned when the security situation
allowed, following the initiation of peace talks between the GoU and the LRA.
74.
The peace talks initiated in mid 2006, starting with a cessation of hostilities in August 2006,
contributed significantly to the increased security in northern Uganda. That in turn led to increased
economic activity and trade, incentives for IDPs to return to their original settlements, and a
reduced number of casualties as a result of the conflict. These were positive exogenous factors that
contributed to the achievement of CAS outcomes and cannot be attributed to Bank interventions.
The Government deserves credit for having included security and conflict resolution as a separate
pillar in the PEAP‐04. Similarly, UJAS partners’ decision to include Pillar 3 and align operations
with the strategic objective paved the way for support to recovery and development efforts with
the cessation of hostilities.
75.
The combination of one major lending operation (NUSAF) and a few smaller operations and
non‐lending products, notably the northern Uganda PER (NUPER) and the study on the implications
of resettlements, was appropriate in supporting GoU in the effort to reduce poverty in northern
Uganda and improve the security situation in the region. The Bank was particularly successful in
contributing to improved livelihoods among households in northern Uganda: forty‐seven percent of
the population in northern Uganda, against a target of thirty percent, has improved access to social
‐ 106 ‐

services through NUSAF, and the MDRP provided reinsertion support to almost 15,000 former
rebels and their collaborators. The NUPER provided key inputs to GoU and development partners
in assessing the status and the gaps in resource flows from the central government, humanitarian
and development partners to northern Uganda, as well as the allocations of expenditures in the
region. It also provided timely recommendations for the elaboration of the PRDP by GoU.
76.
Aid coordination in northern Uganda remained a challenge throughout the CAS period, not
least in the process of development partners switching their focus from humanitarian assistance to
development and rehabilitation efforts. With GoU‐elaboration of a strategic framework for
recovery and development in northern Uganda, the PRDP, aid coordination is improving.
77.
The implementation of NUSAF demonstrated that communities in a post‐conflict are able to
identify, plan, manage, and monitor social investments well suited to their needs; thus, even in a
fragile environment, the right project design may contribute to improved bottom‐up accountability.

PILLAR 4: GOOD GOVERNANCE
78.
Under Pillar 4 of the CAS, the Bank sought to contribute to six outcomes under two strategic
objectives, measured by seven outcome indicators. Several indicators are missing data making it
difficult to assess performance based on the outcome indicators only. Rather, an assessment of
progress towards each strategic objective, and the Bank’s attribution, is provided in the following.
79.
Limited progress was recorded under Pillar 4. For example, there is a general perception of
growing corruption and the Government has failed to pursue any of several high‐profile corruption
scandals during the CAS period. While to a certain extent this may be attributed to external factors,
the ambitious Bank agenda under Pillar 4 was not followed up with appropriate instruments and
interventions. Consequently, the Bank’s contribution under Pillar 4 is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

Some progress was made on indicators towards the targets under SO4.1, although none of
the targets were actually met. On that basis, SO4.1 was only partially achieved. Bank contributions
did not match the ambitious objective and is therefore rated moderately unsatisfactory.
81.
The Bank’s contribution towards SO4.1 consisted of PRSC policy dialogue and the second
Private Sector Competitiveness Project (PSCP‐2). These interventions contributed to the setting up
of the Anti‐Corruption Division of the High Court, improvements in the commercial court system to
reduce the case backlog and improved access to justice.
82.
The Bank also worked on a knowledge product, the Legal and Judicial Sector Assessment.
An unfinished draft was initially prepared by the end of FY05. It was subsequently updated in FY08
and was circulated internally, but has yet to be disseminated to the Government. The knowledge
product was intended to inform the sector dialogues and Bank interventions going forward.
However, significant delays meant that the assessment had negligible impact and the rather late
internal circulation meant that there was a gap in informing policy dialogue and Bank
interventions.
‐ 107 ‐

83.
A well‐functioning justice, law and order sector (JLOS) is an important complement to the
effectiveness of other Bank interventions. Looking forward, therefore, the Bank should consider
providing support to the sector beyond the PRSC policy dialogue, coordinated with support
provided by other development partners.
Strategic Objective 4.2: Strengthened Public Sector Management and Accountability
84.
Progress on outcome indicators under strategic objective 4.2 showed limited progress short
of targets or deterioration. Indicators related to corruption and local government revenue, have
worsened since the baseline year. Consequently, SO4.2 was not achieved. In addition, the Public
Service Reform Program (PSRP) did not achieve the expected results, e.g. failure to implement
results‐oriented management in the public sector. Although semi‐external factors such as
effectiveness delays partly explain the Bank’s limited contributions to SO4.2, overcall Bank
contributions to SO4.2 are rated moderately unsatisfactory.
85.
Bank lending operations in support of public sector management and accountability
included the second Economic and Financial Management Project (EFMP‐2) and the second Local
Government Development Project (LGDP‐2), both carried over from previous CASs.
86.
In the area of local government development, the Bank used a combination of policy
dialogue through the PRSCs and investment lending under LGDP‐2 to assist the Government
develop, publish and roll‐out the Harmonized Participatory Planning Guide (HPPG) to improve
planning and budgeting at local governments (LG); implement the Fiscal Decentralization Strategy;
and the restructuring and support to the Local Government Service Commission to recruit new staff
to operationalize the new local government structures. The Bank also contributed to ensuring
compensation of LGs for taxes abolished.
87.
The EFMP‐2 successfully contributed to improve government planning, budgeting and
financial management. Effective since FY00, the project achieved most of its results prior to this
CAS period. Three other projects (KIIDP, LGMSDP, UPSPEP) were approved during the CAS period,
but did not reach effectiveness until November 2008. Thus, those projects did not deliver any
results in the period under review.
88.
The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment highlighted several
challenges relating to enhancing transparency in budget execution. These issues are being followed
up with the PRSC‐8 operation, and the PEFA assessment provided insights to the design of the Joint
Assessment Framework under the Joint Budget Support Framework.
89.
Bank support towards improved accountability suffered from the lack of studies on
accountability and corruption to inform PRSC policy dialogue, even if the issue was covered
indirectly in PERs (e.g. absenteeism and other waste in the education and health sectors). For
example, baselines on locally relevant actionable governance indicators need to be established
prior to inclusion as prior actions in PRSCs.
90.
In order to support strengthened public sector management and accountability in the
future, the Bank must adopt a clearer framework with actionable governance indicators and
tracking mechanisms in support of the GAC agenda under the new CAS. Not least in the run up to
general elections in 2011, the Bank will need to consider its role vis‐à‐vis other development
partners with respect to advancing the GAC agenda in Uganda.

PILLAR 5: HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
91.
The Bank CAS program under Pillar 5 included 14 outcomes measured by 20 outcome
indicators grouped under four strategic objectives relating to education, health, water and
sanitation, and empowered communities. As is the case for other pillars, several indicators did not
have a baseline and/or where not monitored.
92.
Bank interventions under this pillar consisted of lending through PRSCs, stand alone
projects, and non‐lending (e.g. PERs focusing on health and education, and water sector reviews).
The PRSCs were the main vehicle to support specific actions under the human development pillar.

93.
Performance under Pillar 5 was mixed. Only two out of 14 outcomes were fully achieved,
eight outcomes were partially achieved, while four outcomes were not achieved. In particular, the
health sector and community development saw limited progress. The Bank made significant
contributions towards the progress in education and water and sanitation through lending, PRSC
policy dialogue and through analytical work. However, support to the human development agenda
through PRSCs in some cases proved ineffective in targeting systemic impediments in service
delivery within the sectors. On that basis, Bank contribution under Pillar 5 is rated moderately
satisfactory.
Strategic Objective 5.1: Better Educated Ugandans
94.
Progress was recorded on several of the PEAP/UJAS indicators for education. Particularly,
the target for primary enrollment was surpassed, while the target for secondary enrollment was
almost met. Primary completion rates remain low (47%) and did not meet the target (69%).
Results for post primary enrollment and completion rates as well as tertiary enrollment were
slightly below target.
95.
Uganda has made progress towards MDG‐2 (primary school completion) in terms of
reaching full enrollment, but low completion rates continue to pose a challenge for the outcomes in
education. Relatively high rates of girls to boys at all levels of education indicate that Uganda is
making progress in achieving gender equality in education (MDG‐3). Yet, challenges remain with
regards to low completion rates and substandard quality of primary and secondary education,
including high rates of absenteeism of teachers and increasing pupil‐teacher ratios. On this basis,
SO5.1 was only partially achieved.
96.
Through the PRSCs, the Bank provided support to the education sector reforms including
undertaking the primary education curriculum review process and contributing towards sustained
resource flows to the sector. The focus on supporting GoU in improving the quality of education
rather than just expanding coverage was a step in the right direction. Other lending included the
Millennium Science Initiative, which led to some improvements in the quality of science and
engineering graduates, science and technology research, and coordination of growth‐oriented
science initiatives. In addition, the Makerere Service Delivery Pilot Project, which was undertaken
‐ 109 ‐

in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation, supported local government capacity building
undertaken by universities as well as reform of education and training activities at Makerere
University. The project succeeded in establishing partnerships between universities on curriculum
reform and provided training to more than 2,000 academic and local government staff.
97.
Among the analytical work undertaken, the PER 2007 pointed to inefficiencies in primary
education such as teacher absenteeism, inefficient teacher deployment, and underfunding of non‐
wage expenditures in public schools. Subsequently, the Bank initiated institutional support to the
Directorate of Education Standards to strengthen teacher supervision systems through
partnerships with the Ministry of Local Government.
98.
The combined lending and non‐lending Bank activities under SO5.1 were relatively
successful, not only in implementing the strategies laid out in the CAS, but also through the policy
dialogue with GoU in terms of identifying core problems, initiating and sequencing reforms and
addressing quality issues in the education sector. On this basis, the performance of the Bank is
rated satisfactory.
99.
Bank interventions in the education sector in the next CAS should focus on quality of
education, partnerships with the private sector to reduce the cost of education service delivery, and
efforts to track and address education unit costs and quality gaps. Further, interventions should
include strategies for school‐to‐work transition and skills training (Business, Technical and
Vocational Education and Training).
Strategic Objective 5.2: Healthier Ugandans
100. Only limited progress against the PEAP/UJAS outcomes were recorded under SO5.2, partly
explained by the limited availability of frequent data. Maternal and child mortality rates remain
high and HIV/AIDS prevalence rates, which saw sharp reduction in the 1990s, recently increased.
At the current pace, Uganda is unlikely to meet MDG‐4 (child mortality) and MDG‐5 (maternal
health), but will most likely achieve MDG‐6 (combat HIV/AIDS, malaria). However, the health
sector indicators could be argued to be too high‐level, unrealistic to meet over the short period, and
difficult to monitor on a timely and regular basis. Further, an increase in HIV/AIDS prevalence rate
could reflect that more people now have access to ARVs even if the incidence is declining.
101. The sector faces a number of major challenges: governance and accountability problems are
rampant, as demonstrated with the two cases of misappropriation of funds from vertical funds
(GAVI and Global Fund); population growth continues to increase the demand for health services;
and the sector allocation from the national budget is declining. Together, these challenges
contributed to the poor results recorded in the sector, which is therefore assessed to be only
partially achieved.
102. Bank assistance towards SO5.2 was mainly provided in the form of: i. support through the
PRSCs; ii. the Uganda AIDS Control Project (UACP); and iii. economic sector work in the form of
annual health sector reviews, the 2008 health sector PER, and the Health Systems Support report.
While providing analytical advice and support to the Health Sector Investment Plan, Bank
interventions were not fully effective in achieving the targets set and actions planned, which,
among other things, included support to reproductive health, family planning, malaria control, and
provision of skilled health workers. On that basis, Bank performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.
103. Through a combination of analytical work and the PRSCs, the Bank was partially effective in
shaping the policy dialogue and agenda, including support to human resources management and
procurement reforms. The 2008 health sector PER documented widespread waste and
absenteeism in the sector and highlighted resource gaps, and the policy recommendations now
‐ 110 ‐

provide the foundation for sector reforms and a Bank project currently under preparation to
support health systems strengthening. Further, the CEM successfully put the issue of high
population growth rates on the domestic policy agenda by adopting an indirect approach of looking
at the economic and fiscal consequences of unchecked population growth.
104. The Uganda AIDS Control Project supported capacity building at central, district and
community level and played an important role in shaping the Government’s response to the
epidemic, but most results were achieved under the previous CAS.
105. Lessons learned from the CAS highlight that PRSCs may not always provide the optimal
instrument for addressing health specific problems, and the CAS program for the sector was not
realistic and commensurate with the interventions undertaken. This was particularly true when
GoU’s priorities during CAS implementation changed towards productive sectors. In response to
this and to GoU demands, the Bank is now preparing a standalone health sector project.
106. Looking forward, population is likely to play a prominent role in the GoU’s NDP, which
should be reflected in the next CAS. However, rather than a stand‐alone issue, population should be
embedded in a broader cross‐sectoral framework looking not just at health and family planning, but
also focusing on youth unemployment, skills training, and public service delivery.
Strategic Objective 5.3: Water and Sanitation
107. While some progress in water and sanitation were noted, the results fell short of the
PEAP/UJAS targets. Nevertheless, the improvements indicate that Uganda is on track to meet or
even exceed the corresponding MDG targets, e.g. proportion of population having access to safe
water facilities (target: 62%; status: 65%) and sanitation facilities (target: 72%; status: 68%).
Significant progress was recorded on improved water facility maintenance and the target was
almost achieved. On the other hand, the lack of progress in sanitation provision and hygiene
mitigation had negative effects on achievement of MDGs in the area of infant, child and maternal
mortality. On this basis, SO5.3 was partially achieved. Bank interventions were generally
successful, as interventions were able to address sector wide challenges such as an insufficient
regulatory framework as well as coordination of efforts between ministries. Therefore, Bank
contribution is rated moderately satisfactory.
108. The Bank provided support to the water and sanitation sector via lending through PRSCs,
NUSAF, output‐based aid pilot projects to improve access to piped drinking water in small towns,
and analytical work. The Bank also provided support through the Water and Sanitation Program
(WSP), focusing on strengthening the sanitation interventions of GoU. WSP contributed to raise the
profile of sanitation in the second Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP‐II) and in the PEAP‐04,
leading to a better integration and efficient use of resource at district and sub‐district levels.
109. Through policy dialogue, the Bank highlighted the importance of hygiene and sanitation
interventions, functionality of water facilities, value for money, better resource allocation between
sectors, sector capacity building, integrated water resources management, equity issues, and
governance issues in the sector, and linkages to the Ministry of Health. The PRSC and SWAp
processes supported the development of improved and more specific sector plans. Through PRSC
prior actions, debt of the National Water and Sewerage Cooperation (NWSC) was written off,
making NWSC more attractive for private financing. Further, the Bank assisted the Government in
creating additional pro‐poor services and the NWSC created a pro‐poor unit. In addition, the
recommendations of a study on governance issues and service delivery in the sector informed
sector planning and the draft National Development Plan.

‐ 111 ‐

Strategic Objective 5.4: Community Development
110. The Bank’s support towards SO5.4 was an integrated part of the PRSC series. In addition to
lending, the Bank developed a policy note on Civic Engagement and Social Accountability.
111. PEAP/UJAS targets were not achieved and only saw very limited progress. Thus, community
development workers and community development management committees were not increased
in numbers, capacity and management as planned. Bank contributions did not match the intended
objectives and is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
112. As much as policy reforms were expedited and completed during the CAS period, only
limited progress was noted on actual implementation of policies. Thus, the National Gender Policy
was approved in 2007, but the policy has yet to be implemented; the Equal Opportunities
Commission was established in 2007, but has yet to be operationalized; the Community
Mobilization and Empowerment Strategy was only partly implemented; and the Community
Development Policy was never finalized.
113. A number of factors have contributed to the lack of progress under this strategic objective: i.
the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development is very resource‐constrained; ii. political
support for implementation of the national gender policy remains vague; and iii. the increased
number of districts have put districts and sub‐counties under increased fiscal pressure. Despite
these challenges, Uganda launched gender budgeting as a cross‐cutting issue in the national budget
process in 2009.
114. The PRSCs, mainly focusing on macro level reforms across financial and social sectors, do
not seem to have been the best available instrument for influencing change regarding the
community development component of the PEAP. In retrospect, using the existing interventions on
decentralization and public sector reforms could have provided a much more direct and possibly
more effective intervention.
115. The policy note on institutionalizing Civic Engagement and Social Accountability for
improved development outcomes provided specific recommendations to GoU on harmonizing
collaboration for improved social accountability. Some of its recommendations (e.g. elaboration of
NGO policy and an NGO quality assurance certification mechanism) were since taken up by the
Government and stakeholders, but otherwise the note suffered from lack of follow up in the policy
dialogue and lack of interconnection to other sectors and operations.

B ANK P ORTFOLIO P ERFORMANCE

VOLUME, LENDING AND COSTS – IDA
116. The CAS projected new IDA commitments to reach $1,000m over the FY06­09 CAS
period. By the end of FY09, actual new IDA commitments amounted to $1,287m, cf. Annex 2 and
Figure 3. The increase in total commitments was largely due to the record amounts raised for IDA‐
15 and to Uganda’s consistently high performance in CPIA ratings.12 The PRSCs were reduced from
$600m to $460m over the CAS period. Combined with the increase in the overall program, PRSC’s
share of overall new lending in the period declined from the planned 60 percent to 36 percent.13
Uganda scored 3.9 in the IDA Resource Allocation Index every year from 2005‐08, consistently higher than the IDA
borrowers’ average of 3.3.
13 PRSCs 5‐8 were planned as single‐tranche one year operations each amounting to $150m. PRSC5 and PRSC6 were
reduced by $40m in total, mainly due to limited follow‐up on prior actions by the Government. The planned PRSC7 and
PRSC8 were merged in a dual‐tranche two‐year operation amounting to $200m (PRSC7). See also paragraph 135 below.
12

‐ 112 ‐

117. Nineteen projects were planned for delivery during the CAS period of which only ten
were delivered.14 However, seven new projects, including two regional projects and three
additional financing operations, were delivered over the period, bringing the total number of
projects delivered to 17, cf. Figure 4. A number of projects slipped one or two financial years, partly
because preceding projects in the same sector experienced implementation delays (e.g. local
government and energy).

118. Allocations by sector and pillar of delivered projects deviated substantially from the
planned lending program. As detailed in paragraphs 21 and 22, commitments to projects in the
energy, education and social protection sectors significantly exceeded planned commitments, while
delivered commitments for PRSCs, public sector and the transport sector were lower than planned.
119. Total projects under implementation during this period averaged 18 projects (only IDA
credits), with an average total commitment of $1,276m. World Bank Group disbursements to
Uganda during the CAS period amounted to $754m, in addition to IFC and MIGA guarantees, loans
and equities amounting to $164m and $171m respectively.
120. The project portfolio consisted of twenty­two IDA lending operations at the end of
FY09 (including four regional projects and one guarantee), of which 12 were projects approved
during FY2006‐09. According to ISRs, fourteen projects were rated satisfactory, five moderately
satisfactory, one unsatisfactory, while two projects were not yet effective.
121. A total of fourteen projects closed from FY06­FY09, cf. Annex 5.15 ICRs were available
for eleven of the projects that exited the portfolio, but only nine of these were reviewed by IEG, cf.
Annex 6.16 IEG rated outcomes of five projects (56%) satisfactory, two projects (22%) were rated
moderately satisfactory, while two projects were rated moderately unsatisfactory. These ratings
were generally in accordance with ICR ratings, although there were three disconnects, where IEG
rated outcomes lower than the ICRs.17 Bank performance, borrower performance, and quality of
Bank supervision were generally rated moderately satisfactory or satisfactory by IEG with two
Excluding the Private Power Generation Guarantee (Bujagali).
This excludes two GEF projects: Lake Victoria Environment and Energy for Rural Transformation.
16 At the time of CASCR finalization, ICRs were available for NUSAF and ERT, but no IEG reviews were yet available. Both
projects were rated Satisfactory. A joint ICR is under preparation for the PRSC 5‐7 series; thus, individual ICRs are not
available for PRSC5 and PRSC6.
17 Disconnects for the three projects are generally related to overambitious development objectives and targets, and
indications of performance targets not having been met.

exceptions. IEG ratings of quality at entry reveal some weaknesses, notably because of poor
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) quality ratings. The main problems with M&E quality were
related to inadequacies and lack of indicators and baselines at design stage, limited follow up on
indicators during implementation, and insufficient utilization of M&E systems in terms of tracking
project outcomes.
122. Key lessons learned from projects completed and evaluated during the CAS period
include the following:
i.

APL phases should be executed sequentially and not simultaneously to allow systematic
integration of lessons learned from one phase to the next.

ii.

Well‐designed risk assessments and results frameworks are crucial for success in
implementation and lack of these may hamper project outcomes.

iii.

When undertaking institutional reforms, it is crucial to take into account the existing level of
capacity and adequately account for it through provision of technical assistance. In
addition, project designs should be realistic with respect to institutional reform
achievements and consider phasing of reforms and associated projects.

iv.

The Bank should consider restructuring projects showing significant implementation delays.

v.

Regional projects require strong emphasis on clarity of project objectives, M&E
frameworks, governance and management systems, and clear accountability structures.

123. These recommendations have subsequently been addressed through the introduction of
standardized M&E reviews of all new project packages, application of coherent and sequenced APL
phases, and undertaking restructuring or comprehensive reviews of operations that are
significantly delayed (e.g. UPSPEP). The challenges identified should be closely monitored under
the new CAS.
124. The disbursement rate averaged
24.3%
over
the
period
reflecting
improvements in FY08 and FY09.
The
disbursement rate for Uganda compares well
with the regional average of 21.9% over the
same period. In a historical perspective, the
Bank increased its total commitments in
Uganda to an all time high of more than
$1.4bn in FY09 (cf. Figure 5). At the same
time, the number of national IDA operations
were reduced from 23 projects in FY01 to 16
by the start of FY10, thus indicating a trend
towards fewer, larger projects. Absolute
disbursements reached an all time high in
FY09, although disbursements relative to
commitments only recently reached previous
highs.

125. The average age for projects closed during the CAS period was 7.4 years (excl. PRSCs
and GEF), compared to the regional average of five years. Further, only one of the projects exiting
the portfolio during the CAS period (excl. PRSCs) did not extend the closing date. This reflects
delays to effectiveness and underestimation of implementation times.
‐ 114 ‐

126. Project portfolio performance has been satisfactory overall, cf. Annex 4. From FY06‐
FY09, five to thirty‐five percent of projects were at risk and six projects were rated as problem
projects. The main reasons for problem status were effectiveness delays, implementation delays,
and slow disbursements. All problem projects improved their status quickly due to proactive
interventions from project teams, as evidenced by high pro‐activity rating. The (revised) realism
index stood at 71 percent by the end of FY09, compared to the 43 percent average for the Africa
Region.
127. Project preparation and supervision costs. Project preparation costs (IDA only)
averaged $329,000, compared to the regional average of $478,000, over the period. Average
supervision cost per project amounted to approximately $108,000, on par with the regional average
of $103,000. There is evidence that the supervision budget provided was sufficient and ensured
good quality project supervision. However, a safeguards review of the portfolio completed in FY09
indicated that while safeguards risks are generally managed well in the portfolio, some projects
suffer from limited and inconsistent supervision of safeguards issues, especially for social
safeguards (see also paragraph 135).
128. Effectiveness delays. At the end of FY09, ten of the projects in the Uganda portfolio
experienced effectiveness delays between eight and twenty‐nine months.18 Effectiveness delays are
usually caused by delays to Parliamentary approval, a requirement for IDA credits in Uganda. In
most cases, delays were due to inadequate consultations between the implementing government
agencies and Parliament, through the various stages of project preparation. In many cases,
effectiveness delays increased the risk of subsequent implementation difficulties and need for
thorough review or restructuring, as project relevance, priorities and appropriateness of design are
likely to decline over time. However, given that parliamentary approval is required for all credits in
Uganda, projects under the new CAS should anticipate effectiveness delays in the project
implementation plan and task teams should encourage involvement of major stakeholders at the
design stage.
129. Economic rate of return for investments. Among projects evaluated by IEG, assessments
of economic rate of returns (ERR) were carried out for five projects.19 Findings show that all five
projects had an ERR within the margin planned from the outset, with four projects showing a
higher ERR than anticipated.
130. M&E issues at national, CAS and project level. The Government focused on building the
necessary capacity for monitoring and evaluation of the PEAP through the development and
implementation of the National Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy (NIMES). Several
mechanisms were put in place including the creation of the National M&E Technical Working Group
to coordinate and improve the quality and use of M&E across Government, and the organization of
an Annual Policy Implementation Review (APIR) process to assess progress in the implementation
of the PEAP. However, major challenges in tracking the progress on PEAP/UJAS indicators (and
thus the CAS indicators) appeared during CAS implementation, due to lack of baselines, timeliness,
and frequency of indicators. At the project level, monitoring progress on outputs and outcomes
remains a challenge. Monitoring and evaluation assessments and training were undertaken during
the CAS period, and project teams were advised to retrofit their results frameworks to refine
objectives and indicators, and improve project M&E systems. However, for a few projects or APLs
with several phases (designed prior to the CAS period assessed), shortcomings regarding the
quality of the results frameworks were still observed, according to IEG ICR evaluations.
Of the 17 national projects under implementation at the start of FY10, only seven were declared effective within the
required 90 days from signing of the financing agreement.
19 Second Local Government Development Project, Second Economic and Financial Management Project, Roads
Development Phase 1 and 2, and Power Project 4.

131. Only one Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) took place during this CAS
period in December 2007.20 The CPPR contributed to improved project performance and dialogue
with the Government. The Joint Portfolio Review of December 2007 identified weaknesses of the
Bank’s portfolio in Uganda, remedies, agencies responsible for actions, and a timeline for
implementation. The weaknesses identified included: i. inadequate project identification,
preparation and designs; ii. shortcomings in quality of results frameworks; iii. procurement delays;
iv. inefficient and expensive services of the Bank of Uganda (the central bank); and v. local
knowledge and insights are often disregarded by the Bank. The CPPR pointed to five key areas that
need continuous follow up: i. compliance with project readiness criteria; ii. more effective project
management; iii. improved procurement management; iv. accelerated implementation of an anti‐
corruption framework; and v. strengthening M&E and results management in the Government and
the Bank ISR process. Project coordination units were set up within relevant government
ministries, and they regularly discuss cross‐cutting project implementation issues and follow‐up
actions from the CPPRs. The Bank has increased focus on governance and anti‐corruption (GAC)
both at project level, sector level and the national level. Still, the Bank could have done more to
follow up on the recommendations from the CPPR and review progress against the action plan.
132. A Gender Audit of the country portfolio was completed in June 2007. The audit revealed
that while almost a third of the Bank projects active at the time directly addressed the most
pressing gender issues in the country, a large number of projects do not systematically integrate
gender concerns in their design. The Gender Audit Report provided recommendations on gender
awareness and capacity building among project staff, application of gender analysis in project
design and implementation (including M&E frameworks) and strengthening institutional
accountability for gender mainstreaming in Bank operations (including representation on project
beneficiary groups, integration in PAD, and use of gender disaggregated data). Recommendations
were followed up in subsequent operations where relevant.
133. Financial Management. Ratings for safeguards and fiduciary aspects were satisfactory and
no projects had any substantial issues to be raised regarding safeguards and fiduciary issues.
However, a few cross‐cutting issues in financial management are affecting implementation: i. Bank
of Uganda’s (BoU) services are not fully satisfactory. A few projects still receive bank statements
with errors and there are instances of delays in crediting funds disbursed by the World Bank to the
projects’ special accounts. BoU is at an advanced stage in procuring a new banking software system
to address this issue; ii. Internal audits. Most projects that are mainstreamed within ministries do
not have their activities integrated into work plans of internal audit units to review their internal
control systems and ensure their adequacy. The Office of the Auditor General, in collaboration with
the Bank, conducts annual financial audits and issues management letters to accompany the audits,
highlighting the internal control and accountability issues therein. In case of risks identified and
requiring value for money or forensic audits, these are also commissioned.
134. The implementation of procurement streamlining has significantly progressed during the
CAS period, but a number of challenges remain. The focus on building a regulatory framework and
the assignment of an additional Procurement Specialist at the World Bank Country Office
strengthened procurement management in the Bank’s portfolio in Uganda. However, procurement
delays for many projects have resulted in late delivery of the required items (goods, works and
consulting services) to the intended beneficiaries, particularly in infrastructure sectors. Such delays
slow down project implementation and are due to a combination of factors, including: i. weak
project management oversight and procurement capacity among project staff; ii. challenges
associated with the unique and innovative nature of some contracts, e.g. in the energy sector; iii.
inadequate technical skills, and iv. poor project management. The Bank will continue to address
20

Previous CPPRs in Uganda were completed in 2001 and 2005. A new CPPR for Uganda was completed in early CY10.

‐ 116 ‐

these challenges through support via specialists based in the country office, hiring of additional
consultants for complex projects, and introducing performance evaluation of project managers and
coordinators to improve results.
135. The safeguards portfolio review carried out in FY09 found environmental and social
risks of the portfolio well managed, with a high degree of compliance with the safeguards policies.
The shortcomings identified through the review included: i. weak capacity in some counterpart
agencies; ii. environment assessment mis‐categorization of several projects; and iii. safeguards
understaffing, although capacity to manage safeguards in country was enhanced by posting
additional safeguards staff in the Country Office. It was also observed that while safeguards
concerns are included during project preparation, there is limited supervision and follow up during
implementation, partly due to understaffing. On the social safeguards side, lack of a national
resettlement policy continues to pose a challenge.
136. In conclusion, the Bank delivered a larger lending program with fewer projects than
projected in the CAS. Apart from minor gaps in project preparation and supervision, the quality of
project implementation, outcomes and portfolio performance was generally satisfactory and cost
effective. The Bank delivered more IDA support to the energy, education and social protection
sectors, and less through PRSCs and to the transport sector than planned; however, this was partly
explained by the Bank’s flexibility in responding to changing client priorities. While portfolio
performance was generally good, there is still room for improvement in addressing quality of
project preparation and effectiveness delay issues, and ensuring efficient project implementation.

One major safeguard issue during this CAS was the Bujagali Inspection Panel Case. Responding to a request in
March 2007 from the National Association of Professional Environmentalists (NAPE), a Ugandan non‐
governmental organization, the Inspection Panel investigated the World Bank’s compliance with its
operational policies on potential environmental, economic, and social impacts. The Panel found the Bank in
compliance with several policy provisions, including assessing project impacts on fisheries, establishing a
dam safety panel, issuing land titles to project‐affected people, and completing a baseline hydrologic data
series. It also found a number of cases of non‐compliance such as assessments of project alternatives and
cumulative impacts, exclusion of Lake Victoria from the project’s area of influence, and in the assessment of
project costs, risks, and impacts on electricity tariffs. The Panel commended the Bank for its work on
conserving the Kalagala Falls area as an environmental offset to the Bujagali project, responding to the
Panel’s earlier investigation. On December 12, 2008, the Board of Directors discussed the Inspection Panel
Report and the Management Response to the report. The Board noted that the Bank should remain engaged
in Uganda’s energy sector, and some Board members expressed that the Bujagali project was an example of
an improved World Bank Group approach to infrastructure projects, and a commitment to address
associated economic, environmental, and social dimensions of development projects. Members eventually
approved the range of actions set forth in the Management Response and the additional actions that
management intends to undertake in view of the Inspection Panel investigation and Board deliberations.21

The Bank team agreed on a Management Action Plan that includes: timely implementation of a sustainable
management plan for Kalagala Falls; updating and implementation of a cultural property management plan; and
undertaking an enhanced socio‐economic study to support and fully achieve livelihood restoration. Management will
undertake these actions in consultation with the Government of Uganda, affected people and the project sponsor. In
addition, management will develop guidance on how to address environmental and social safeguard issues in legacy
projects that suffer from interruptions in implementation, such as in the Bujagali project. The Management Action Plan is
currently being implemented.

IDA NON‐LENDING
137. The CAS contains two different sets of projections for ESW delivery: one indicates 27 ESWs
to be delivered over the period while the other mixes TAs, ESWs, and technical memoranda such as
the JSAN and DSAs. This makes it difficult to accurately assess the delivery of ESWs against CAS
targets. However, a manual count indicates that a total of 20 ESWs and three TAs were planned for
the CAS period, while at the end of the CAS period, a total of 20 ESWs and nine TAs had been
delivered.
138. There were some delays in delivery
of AAA, as shown in Figure 6 and in Annex 3,
with 12 of the planned ESWs delivered in the
latter part of the CAS period. In addition, some
ESWs were not produced as outlined in the
CAS, and several ESWs not included in the
original CAS were delivered. Two ESWs were
dropped after having incurred significant
costs. In some cases, delays in delivery may
have a negative impact on the impact of the
analytical work and also provides a weaker
foundation for lending operations meant to
follow up on ESWs.

however, in timing, dissemination (especially of ESWs with cross‐sectoral relevance), planning of
the output, and coordinating with Government and other development partners. The Country
Economic Memorandum, along with the Public Expenditure Reviews of 2007 and 2008, helped
shape the policy dialogue with the Government and assisted in identifying priorities and strategic
directions for GoU and Bank interventions. This is evidenced by the CEM and PERs being cited in
various GoU policy and planning documents.

140. Nine TAs funded by the Bank budget were completed during this CAS. Technical assistance
was mostly provided to complement existing operations and often focused on one particular event
or product, including Presidential Investor Round Table events, technical reforms, and support to
policy reforms (PRDP, ICT Policy). Future CASs would benefit from a clear outline of timing,
content and priority of TAs.
141. The relevance and timeliness of ESW vis‐à‐vis the dialogue with the client, as well as the
direct impact of ESW findings and recommendations on policy reforms, are both indications that
the non‐lending program was performing well, despite some products that were not sufficiently
followed up in the client dialogue, and some planned ESWs not delivered.

IDA INSTRUMENTS
142. As described in detail in earlier sections, the PRSCs showed declining performance over the
CAS period. For example the slow progress on reforms under the latest PRSC7 indicates that the
speed and effectiveness of implementation of the PRSCs and prior actions have been reduced.
22

No formal evaluations or reviews have been carried out of ESWs on Uganda completed FY06‐FY09.

‐ 118 ‐

143. The relatively high number of APLs in projects delivered during the CAS period (five out of
17) is a sign of the willingness and interest of the Bank and GoU to engage in phased, long‐term
reform programs in the energy, transport, and education sectors.
During this CAS, Uganda also scaled up the implementation efforts by piloting Output
Based Aid in several projects. This has proven to be a successful endeavor in terms of delivering
results, as further outlined in Box 6.
144.

Box 6: Output­Based Aid in Uganda: Targeting Support to Reach the Poor
Output‐Based Aid (OBA) involves performance‐based subsidies that are channeled through a service
provider after the provider has delivered pre‐agreed outputs to targeted populations. This is intended to
increase transparency and the efficiency in use of funds.
In no other IDA country has this results‐based public funding targeting mechanism been used more widely
than in Uganda. Implementation of these OBA schemes began during the CAS period.
 The ICT component of ERT I included $10.5m in OBA subsidies contributed by IDA with the objective to
accelerate access to voice telephony in rural areas, provide internet access in district headquarters, and
establish rural multipurpose tele‐centers at schools and hospitals. The project has largely been
considered a success, with coverage expanding (e.g. over 10,000 public and private phones installed in
previously un‐served sub‐counties), and average cost per minute of various services in rural areas
decreasing by almost 50%.
 On energy, ERT I and ERT II both include OBA programs to increase rural electrification. While ERT I
focused on (largely GEF‐funded) off‐grid photo‐voltaic systems funded through an OBA approach, ERT II
includes grid and mini‐grid based expansion to poor households through an OBA subsidy.
 On health, KfW and GPOBA jointly funded an OBA scheme of $7.3m ($4.3m through the Bank‐
administered GPOBA grant). This scheme aims to provide 110,000 safe deliveries and provide
treatment for 35,000 patients with sexually‐transmitted diseases. The first healthy babies were
delivered under this scheme in FY09.
 On water, a $3.2m grant was provided by GPOBA to improve access to piped drinking water in small
towns. The project involved competitive bidding by local private operators, which resulted in clear
efficiency gains including several “zero subsidy” bids whereby the lowest bidder plans the required
expansion through private financing recouped through the tariff. In 2008, a $2.6m GPOBA grant was
provided to the NWSC, for expansion of pro‐poor yard taps and stand‐posts into slum and peri‐urban
areas of Kampala to be spearheaded by NWSC's Urban Pro‐Poor Branch. By FY09, over 25,000
residents in Greater Kampala received improved access through the scheme.
Valuable lessons have been learned, not only for Uganda, but for the WBG more widely, including:
 For OBA to work, service providers must have access to affordable finance to “pre‐finance” output
delivery. More work is needed in this area, especially in IDA countries.
 OBA schemes in basic services involve working with local private (including NGO) providers; sufficient
time and capacity building must be considered, especially with pilots.
 Bank fiduciary systems can work with OBA, but greater knowledge sharing is needed.

TRUST FUNDS
145. The CAS did not include a description of the application and strategic use of trust funds,
despite the portfolio containing several large trust funds at the beginning of the CAS period. The
following is therefore based on an assessment of trust funds implemented during the CAS period.
146. Over the CAS period, the Uganda program included disbursements from 48 trust funds
(including IFC trust funds) providing more than $47m in grants, cf. annex 7. More than half of the
trust funds were Bank executed, but in terms of volume, 91 percent of the trust fund commitments
‐ 119 ‐

and disbursements were recipient executed. The majority of trust funds were closely linked to
lending operations and thus aligned with the Government’s priorities.
147. Trust funds focused mainly on: i. environment and sustainable energy (GEF); ii. piloting of
output‐based aid in health and water supply (GPOBA); iii. support through the MDRP to
demobilization and reintegration of ex‐combatants from the conflict in northern Uganda; iv.
support to prepare Uganda’s response to avian flu; and v. support to strengthening the monitoring
and evaluation system of the PEAP. Trust funds also contributed to the completion of various AAA
during the CAS period, including the CEM and the report on Land Policies in northern Uganda, a
study on sanitation, a Poverty and Inequality study, and a NUSAF Impact Evaluation report.
148. Projects that integrated major trust funds in design and implementation include LVEMP,
ERT I, NUSAF, Emergency and Demobilization and PAMSU. Of the trust funds closed, five were rated
by implementation completion memoranda or ICRs. Three were rated moderately satisfactory in
development outcome,23 and two were rated satisfactory.24 Assessments did not reveal cross
cutting lessons learned in terms of the use of trust funds, but focused on the effectiveness and
outcomes within each project.
149. Looking forward, the new CAS should ensure that trust funds are integrated in the strategic
framework, including the results framework, for Bank assistance to the country, both on the lending
and the non‐lending side.

REGIONAL PROJECTS, TRUST FUNDS, AND AAAS
150. While acknowledging the importance of regional integration for Uganda’s development, and
including regional projects as part of the lending program, the CAS did not in detail assess the
implications of and opportunities for regional integration and how to address this strategically
under the CAS; nor did the CAS include regional indicators in the results framework.
151. During the CAS period, there were five regional operations involving Uganda. Commitments
amounted to $475m, of which IDA contributions from Uganda amounted to $55m, cf. Annex 2 and
Annex 8. During the CAS period, one regional project closed (LVEMP), two projects were approved
(East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation Project and LVEMP‐2), one project slipped (East
Africa Regional Power Project) and one was dropped (RCIP). By the end of FY09, one project was
rated satisfactory and the other three were rated moderately satisfactory. Two additional regional
operations including Uganda are in the pipeline for FY10 (East Africa Agriculture Productivity
Project and East Africa Health Systems Strengthening), and at least another two regional projects
are in the pipeline for FY11‐13.
152. Three regional trust funded projects were implemented in the areas of agriculture,
HIV/AIDS, and water resources. In addition, various trust funded projects supporting activities
under the Nile Basin Initiative amounting to more than $66m were implemented during the CAS
period, including training, capacity building and institutional support (cf. Annex 10).
153. Three regional ESWs and two regional TAs were delivered during the CAS period, mainly in
the areas of supporting EAC integration (cf. Annex 9).

23 GEF Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project; Strengthening Civil Society and Government Partnership in
monitoring Public Expenditure (IDF); and Amnesty Commission Special Project For Repatriation, Rehabilitation,
Resettlement and Reintegration of Reports in Uganda (MDRP).
24 GEF Energy for Rural Transformation and PRSP‐Uganda; Capacity Building For Decentralized Community Based

‐ 120 ‐

154. While achieving results, regional operations have been facing significant implementation
challenges due to coordination complexities both in projects and in handling many different clients
simultaneously. This has often resulted in delays to project implementation and in preparation of
new projects. Considering the importance of regional integration, these challenges need to be
addressed under the new CAS.

MIGA, IFC AND WBI
155. Over the CAS period, IFC focused on development of financial markets, infrastructure,
agribusiness, support to the privatization program, and MSME development jointly with the World
Bank. The total IFC portfolio for Uganda as of August 2009 amounted to $202m, of which support
to the Bujagali Hydro Power Project is by far the largest activity ($130m loan). IFC committed a
$25m loan to Umeme, the Uganda electricity distribution company, to assist its expansion of the
distribution network, increase connections and reduce technical losses. Uganda is one of the pilot
countries in the IFC/IDA MSME initiative, which supports access to finance, business development
services, and business enabling environment. IFC has also acted as an advisor to the Governments
of Kenya and Uganda regarding privatization of the joint Kenya‐Uganda railway line, and
committed $32m for the railways concession. This initiative has not been completed and is
expected to be carried forward under the next CAS as part of a wider regional strategic engagement
on infrastructure development in East Africa, including railways. IFC provided technical assistance
to local banks to develop housing finance skills and provided $16m loans to assist the growth of the
mortgage and term finance for SMEs, of which $2m was dedicated to women entrepreneurs. IFC
also provided trade finance support to Orient Bank and a risk sharing facility to a microfinance
institution to access funding from Citibank.
Box 7: Summary of IEG Evaluation of IFC Activities in Uganda 1999­200825
Between 1999 and 2008, IFC invested $187m in 10 projects in Uganda, including, power,
telecommunications, financial sectors and small investments in agribusiness and education. IFC’s main
contribution has been in telecommunications where it helped restructure the sector and expand access to
mobile communications. In addition, IFC provided assistance to the government to improve or create
regulations in insurance, leasing and mortgage sectors and helped its clients to introduce new financial
products. However, limited success was seen in the power sector, improving SMEs’ access to financing and
developing housing finance. IFC’s experience in Uganda was characterized by strong government
commitment to policy and institutional reform, a judicial mix of advisory services and investments and a
close and well established relationships between IFC staff and clients.
The main challenges for IFC going forward are: i. to promote more broad‐based growth by increasing its
support for non‐financial sectors; ii. to maintain its support of the financial sector so that banks develop
capacities to lend to SMEs and promote other underserved segments of the economy. IEG recommends that
IFC: i. finds new ways to reach small businesses; ii. remains engaged as an advisor in privatization
transactions for a period after completion of the initial transaction; iii. considers the establishment of a field
presence in smaller, high risk countries that have undertaken significant reforms and established favorable
business environments; and iv. capitalizes on new opportunities presented by increasing south‐south
investment flows.

156. MIGA’s portfolio in Uganda consists of three projects for which the Agency has issued
guarantees to investors incorporated in Bermuda, Luxembourg and St. Kitts & Nevis. The projects
are in support of the agribusiness and infrastructure sectors in Uganda and have a combined gross
exposure of $158m. MIGA continued the cooperation through a technical assistance program with
the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA) to identify new projects. MIGA has worked consistently
25

Cf. chapter 8 in the IEG joint Country Assistance Evaluation, Uganda 2001‐2007.

‐ 121 ‐

with Uganda Investment Authority on various capacity building programs over the years. In
addition, Uganda is one of the countries covered by MIGA’s Africa enterprise benchmarking
program, a program which is linked to the Bank’s investment climate assessment. Building on
enterprise benchmarking program results, MIGA is working with UIA to secure donor funding for
an investment outreach program.
157. Uganda continues to be an active participant in WBI programs, averaging over 800
participants annually over the past five years. Multi‐year activities will continue in such areas as
support to oversight institutions (media and parliament) and economic competitiveness (public
private partnership and financial sector management). In addition, in FY09, WBI has implemented
activities in local governance, water and rural development, science, technology and innovation,
carbon finance, south‐south dialogues with Brazil on cluster development, and climate change.
Regional programs in areas such as health and climate change have also been attended by
participants from Uganda.
158. Coordination between the Bank, IFC, and MIGA should be improved during the new CAS.
Several of the key challenges facing Uganda, notably infrastructure investments, deepening of
financial markets, commercialization of agriculture and water and sanitation, provide opportunities
for the three institutions to complement each other in providing support to the client.

CLIENT SURVEYS
159. A Client Survey was completed in 2008. The survey had 306 respondents and a response
rate of 56%, with respondents representing government officials, media, private sector, civil
society, developments partners etc. A large majority of respondents think the Bank considers its
primary priority in Uganda as ‘ensuring macro‐economic stability consistent with rapid growth’,
followed by infrastructure, private sector growth, and strengthening public sector management.
This is well aligned with identified development priorities in Uganda. However, when asked which
areas the Bank should focus on in Uganda, stakeholders point to infrastructure, agriculture,
community empowerment, and private sector growth before identifying ensuring macro‐economic
stability consistent with rapid growth.
160. Outside of government, stakeholders are not positive about the Bank’s effectiveness in the
country. While in some areas (e.g. infrastructure, growth and agriculture) the Bank’s work is highly
appreciated, stakeholders are less positive in the areas of governance, corruption and empowering
communities. These findings suggest that the Bank needs to become more effective at
demonstrating and communicating results achieved in Uganda.

COUNTRY DIALOGUE AND AID COORDINATION
161. The Bank enjoys a strong policy dialogue with the Government, underpinned by the Bank’s
analytical work and significant engagement in key sectors for development. This is demonstrated
by government requests for sector investment lending operations in areas covered by public
expenditure reviews. In addition, the Bank is frequently called upon to provide brief policy notes
and other inputs to the ongoing policy debate.
162. As chair of the development partner coordination and harmonization forum, the Local
Development Partners’ Group, the Bank contributes to constructive dialogue between development
partners as a group and the Government. With more than 40 development partners (DPs) active in
Uganda and DPs contributing significant amounts to the government budget and as a share of GDP,
the development partner coordination apparatus is rather large. Nonetheless, sector dialogues
‐ 122 ‐

between the Government, development partners and other stakeholders are formalized through a
range of sector working groups, technical working groups etc.
163. The WB is working closely with the Government and other DPs in designing a Joint Budget
Support Framework (JBSF) that is aligned to the budget cycle and sector processes. At the core of
this is a multi‐annual Joint Assessment Framework (JAF) focusing on efficiency in public spending
and enhanced service delivery, in support of the Government’s own value for money agenda.
164. While GoU‐DP dialogue at sector/thematic levels is generally rather constructive, it could be
strengthened at the higher level. In particular, there is scope for improving the effectiveness of aid
if the Government took leadership in outlining rules and guidelines for the provision of
development assistance and the role and responsibilities of DPs in the country. With the support of
development partners, the National Development Plan has a chapter on the Government’s Aid
Policy, which is intended to provide the foundation and framework for improved aid coordination.
With DPs signing up to GoU’s Aid Policy, it will practically replace the need for a UJAS‐2.
165. The most recent Paris Declaration Monitoring Survey (2008) refers to Uganda as a front‐
runner on aid effectiveness. Although there is room for improvement, progress is recorded on all
Paris Declaration indicators. The Ownership dimension of the Paris Declaration scores the highest
mark (High) of the five dimensions, for the PEAP’s role as an operational strategy. Given the
arguments put forward in this report, with the PEAP having become a largely irrelevant framework
for policy implementation, the basis for this rating is not entirely clear. Nonetheless, the main
lesson learned in the area of country dialogue and aid coordination is that the Bank should critically
assess to what extent the new National Development Plan provides a reliable framework for policy
implementation in Uganda before the next CAS is uncritically aligned with the NDP. While this may
not be fully known at the time of drafting the new CAS, the CAS Progress Report must assess this
issue and, if necessary, realign the CAS at that stage.

V.

L ESSONS L EARNED AND I SSUES TO BE A DDRESSED BY THE NEXT CAS

General Lessons and Issues to be Addressed
166. A joint strategy, elaborated with other development partners, is neither a necessary nor a
sufficient condition for more effective aid. Rather than spending resources on elaborating a joint
strategy, efforts should be devoted to developing an operational framework for alignment with the
national development strategy, for allowing dynamic changes, and for harmonization and
coordination amongst development partners. The Joint Budget Support Framework (JBSF)
currently being finalized is an example of such an operational framework.
167. Full alignment with an incomplete and/or irrelevant national development strategy should
be avoided. A careful assessment of the completeness and strategic relevance of the new National
Development Plan should guide the formulation of the next CAS for Uganda. While a full
assessment of the relevance of the new
168. The impact of a CAS may be reduced in cases where there is no or limited selectivity. The
Bank should consider increased focus in a limited number of sectors. Due to inertia in
implementation of the ongoing portfolio, greater selectivity will not be achieved from the beginning
on the new CAS. Yet, rather than ensuring Bank presence in each and every sector, selectivity might
improve the effectiveness of the program, possible combined with AAA in sectors where no lending
is taking place.
169. Credible, concise and realistic results frameworks for the CAS and for individual projects
are important for planning, monitoring and budgeting purposes, including realistic targets for
‐ 123 ‐

PRSCs with their relative short life‐cycle. If links between the results framework of individual
projects and the CAS are not established, operations are unlikely to contribute effectively to the
CAS’ overall objectives.
170. Successful reforms depend on strong sector involvement. Therefore, reforms supported
under PRSCs should be linked to sector strategies or specific sector investment operations. A
corollary to this insight is that long term sector reform issues should not be addressed exclusively
through APLs or SILs. Reforms may still be pursued through the PSRCs in areas where the Bank
does not have lending operations, as long as sector challenges are effectively addressed by other
development partners.
171. Delays to effectiveness (notably Parliamentary approval) have affected the performance of
the Bank portfolio throughout the CAS period. These delays are largely considered to be
exogenous; if that is in fact the case, they should at least be anticipated at the project design stage.
In addition, the Bank should encourage early involvement of relevant stakeholders during project
design.
172. On lending types and policy reforms: i. the Bank should avoid implementing phased APLs in
parallel, to allow for incorporation of lessons learned; ii. policy reforms should not be combined
with SILs as this tends to delay project implementation.
173. To maximize the impact of the Bank’s non‐lending activities, all ESWs will need a plan and a
budget for dissemination activities, as well as a plan for follow‐up to the conclusions reached and
advice provided.
174. Portfolio performance reviews are only useful to the extent that follow‐up actions are
agreed to, followed up and eventually implemented. A more careful approach to the design of CPPR
events is needed in order to increase relevance of reviews and ensure timely implementation.
Sector Specific Lessons and Issues to be Addressed
175. For continued successful economic management, focus on binding constraints to future
growth needs to be maintained. With continued pressure on social services from the rapidly rising
population, increased efficiency in service delivery and a reduction of public administration costs
are key components to be addressed. Oil revenue management poses another risk (and
opportunity) for continued macroeconomic stability.
176. The success of direct Bank involvement in the agriculture sector will depend on a credible
policy and institutional framework for the sector, which remains outward‐oriented and is not
influenced by political patronage considerations. Further, progress in the agriculture sector needs
a cross‐sectoral approach including better rural roads, greater access to electricity and
communication infrastructure, more marketing infrastructure and better access to finance in rural
areas.
177. The Bank will need to address the Government’s limited absorptive capacity in
infrastructure investments and address the relatively high unit costs of roads to justify continued
lending to the sector. Therefore, in the next CAS, the Bank should be looking at how the
Government can enhance the effectiveness and transparency in the use of funds allocated to the
infrastructure sector.
178. Environment and natural resources programs need better integration in other development
efforts to reach desirable and sustainable results, but this may not necessarily involve Bank
interventions in case other DPs are active in the area.
179. The Bank must adopt a clearer framework with actionable governance indicators and
tracking mechanisms in support of the GAC agenda under the new CAS. Not least in the run up to
‐ 124 ‐

general elections in 2011, the Bank will need to consider its role vis‐à‐vis other development
partners with respect to advancing the GAC agenda in Uganda.
180. Lessons from the CAS highlight that PRSCs may not always provide the optimal instrument
for addressing health specific problems. Further, the CAS program for the sector was not realistic
and commensurate with the interventions undertaken.
181. Addressing the population issue should be embedded in a broader cross‐sectoral
framework looking not just at health and family planning, but also focusing on youth
unemployment, skills training, and public service delivery.
182. The PRSCs, mainly focusing on macro level reforms across financial and social sectors, do
not seem to be the best available instrument for influencing change regarding the community
development component of the PEAP. In retrospect, using the existing interventions on
decentralization and public sector reforms could have provided a much more direct and possibly
more effective intervention.

rates remain a problem due to
high dropout rates.

Minimum primary
teachers’ wage level:
enhanced towards UGX

Bank contributions: Overall, the
Bank successfully contributed to
progress in the sector, including
curriculum development for
lower primary teacher salaries
increase, construction of seed
secondary schools, and improved
curriculum emphasis for science
and technology. The PER 2007
helped identify crucial gaps and
challenges in the sector and
provided important input to the
policy dialogue with GoU in terms
of how to address weaknesses.

Bank interventions in the
education sector in the
next CAS should focus on
quality of education,
ensure clear
measurement of learner
proficiency, support
partnerships with the
private sector to reduce
the cost and increase
efficiency of education
service delivery, and
efforts to track and
address education unit
costs and quality gaps.
Further, interventions
should include strategies
for school‐to‐work
transition and skills
training.

Bank Contribution: Moderately unsatisfactory
Progress: Uganda did not achieve
significant progress on most of
the health indicators during the
UJAS period and only few PEAP
outcome targets were met.

exceed CAS targets (protected
springs, boreholes drilled and
new wells constructed). Specific
outcomes were achieved,
including reaching almost two
million additional people in rural
areas with water connections,
achieving higher than planned
results in new number of
connections in rural and urban
areas, and introducing debt write
off for National Water and
