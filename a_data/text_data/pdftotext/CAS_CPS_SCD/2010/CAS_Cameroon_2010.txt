i.

Since the World Bank Board o f Directors last discussed a Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Cameroon in September o f 2003,’ much has changed in the global
economic climate and with respect to the country’s future trajectory. The global slowdown
has resulted in a significant contraction o f Cameroon’s exports other than oil, notably
timber, rubber and cotton, and long-hoped for investments in the mining sector have been
indefinitely postponed. While significant reforms were undertaken over the period since the
last CAS was elaborated, much remains to be done to improve development effectiveness
and transparent, efficient use o f resources in order to unlock Cameroon’s potential.
Cameroon: Vast potential, but with constraints
Cameroon’s macroeconomic performance has strengthened in recent years. Debt
relief in 2006 under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI) helped firm up the country’s debt sustainability, and create fiscal
space for spending targeted on poverty reduction. Cameroon maintained sound macro
policies throughout the financial crisis. The country’s growth achievement remains
nevertheless disappointing. Despite the progress made to consolidate macroeconomic
stability, poor infrastructure and an unfavorable business environment s t i l l hamper
economic activity and make it difficult to reach the growth rates needed to reduce poverty
on a sustainable basis. GDP growth between 2003 and 2007 was limited (3.3 percent on
average per annum), and remained below the average annual growth rate o f 4.2 percent
achieved between 2000 and 2002. In per capita terms, real GDP grew by only 0.6 percent
on average between 2000 and 2007. As a result, poverty rates virtually stagnated from
2001-2007 at 39.9 percent. O n its current trajectory, Cameroon i s likely to meet only one of
the Millennium Development Goals, namely primary school enrollment.

..

11.

Cameroon’s main development challenges and opportunities
Cameroon’s central challenge i s to stimulate a robust rate o f growth, and to ensure
this i s equitably shared amongst the population in order to reduce poverty. The country’s
governance deficit constitutes a major obstacle in achieving this, as evidenced in weak
public expenditure management and a highly centralized state machinery that has few
downward linkages to those most in need. A poor business climate undermines Cameroon’s
competitiveness and growth prospects, as does significant underinvestment in critical
infrastructure that could improve service delivery and broaden economic growth both at
national and regional levels. To that end, Cameroon’s economy must become more
competitive and public financial management must improve, creating a favorable
environment to ensure the sustainable and transparent use o f the country’s considerable
natural resources.

...
111.

Cameroon’s vision for growth and development
The recently completed PRSP envisions significant investment in infrastructure to
stimulate growth, notably in energy, roads, port infrastructure, water supply, and
information technology. Productive increases are sought in agriculture and livestock
farming, and mining. The PRSP also looks for improvement in key value chains and in the
iv.

vi

business climate. I t looks to strengthen human development and develop more robust
formal sector employment. The PRSP also places important emphasis on regional
integration, and envisions strengthened partnerships with non-traditional donors. Finally, it
dedicates an entire chapter to improving governance, including specific initiatives related
to corruption, public procurement, business climate, and civic participation.

The Bank Group Assistance Strategy
v.
The World Bank will help to stimulate growth by improving the competitiveness o f
the Cameroonian economy through two main pillars and the cross-cutting governance
theme.

A Strategy Grounded in Governance
vi.
Cameroon’s greatest development challenge i s governance. The pervasiveness o f
bad governance inculcates most economic transactions. As a result, development outcomes
suffer and those in the greatest need are most adversely affected. The W o r l d Bank response
to this issue will be tackled in a cross-cutting, pragmatic manner. The Bank will continue to
leverage i t s program to promote improvement in core governance (including public
finance management), will deepen i t s work on governance at the sector levels, and will aim
to mainstream a governance dialogue in-country so as to create an enabling environment
for behavior change in the medium-term.
Strategic Theme One: Increasing Cameroon ’s Competitiveness
vii.
Vastly improved competitiveness underpins Cameroon’s intended growth
trajectory. As such, World Bank support to improve competitiveness will focus on three
principal axes: (i)increased infrastructure investment in the energy, transport, and
telecommunications sectors; (ii)activities geared toward ensuring the transparent,
equitable, and sustainable use o f natural resources, including mining, agriculture, fisheries,
and protected areas; and (iii)promotion o f high potential value chains and improved
business climate. Given the important role it plays in improving competitiveness, regional
integration i s a critical part o f this strategic theme.
Strategic Theme Two: Improving Service Delivery
...
viii.
Effective service delivery i s critical in reducing poverty. Cameroon must place
much greater focus on ensuring that poverty i s tackled in a meaningful way. As such,
World Bank support to service delivery will focus o n three main areas: (i)human
development, where educational efficacy and accountability will be improved, and the
quality o f health services will increase; (ii)social protection, to help develop an effective
local development, where the focus
safety net system based on targeted programs; and (iii)
will be on increasing access to basic services through infrastructure upgrading and capacity
building for improved local governance.

Program delivery, monitoring, and management
ix.
Total IDA resource availability to Cameroon during the CAS period from FY2010
to FY2013 i s estimated at approximately US$430 million. The CAS includes a strong focus
on managing for development results. The CAS outcomes are based o n a holistic view o f
development, incorporating the concept o f strong interdependencies between different
interventions and outcomes, and acknowledging cross-sector synergies that influence CAS
vii

contributions. The CAS indicators will be tracked in real time, using a recently developed
CAS monitoring tool.
Aid coordination, partnership and consultation
CAS preparation involved sustained and substantive discussions with Cameroonian
government officials, civil society, private sector actors, and legislators that led to a
consensual vision for Bank activities over the CAS period. Capitalizing on a joint need to
prepare new strategies in the same timefiame, the Bank undertook a collaborative CAS
preparation process with the African Development Bank. With the broader donor
community, the Bank worked in close collaboration with the Comite‘ Multi-Bailleurs
(CMB), a Yaoundd-based group that consists o f heads o f development cooperation for
major multi- and bi-lateral donors during strategy preparation. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) spearheaded consultations with the private sector and worked closely
with World Bank colleagues to use the strategy preparation process as an opportunity to
identify synergies at the sector level.

x.

Managing risks
xi.
The fragile global economy, coupled with a challenging country context, present
several risks to the strategy, including exogenous risks associated with the global economic
crisis, and more critically development effectiveness risks associated with Cameroon’s
poor track record implementing reforms that have a direct impact on poverty reduction.
This situation could become more acute in the lead up to presidential elections in 201 1.
Mitigating this risk calls for developing projects where there i s strong political will, close
implementation support f i o m task teams, and continuing to strengthen the Bank Group’s
policy dialogue at a l l levels o f government, including with the Executive Branch o f
Government. From a fiduciary perspective, Cameroon i s a high-risk environment, and as a
result the Bank will continue and deepen i t s aggressive, practical interventions to ensure
fiduciary integrity o f IDA operations.

Cameroon Country Assistance Strategy
Inclusive Growth

1,
Since the World Bank Board o f Directors last discussed a Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Cameroon in September o f 2003, much has changed in the global economic climate
and with respect to the country’s future trajectory. O i l revenue, on which the Government o f
Cameroon (GoC) i s heavily dependent, has fluctuated wildly. The global slowdown has
resulted in a significant contraction o f Cameroon’s other export commodities, notably timber
and cotton, and long-hoped for investments in the mining sector have been indefinitely
postponed. The previous CAS was developed in the wake o f Cameroon’s first Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRSP), and an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) bridged Fiscal Years 2007 and
2008 so that Government could complete its updated poverty reduction strategy, which has
only come to fmition in August 2009. Despite the delays associated with the elaboration o f the
“Growth and Employment Strategy” (DSCE), the process demonstrated strong buy-in for both
i t s vision and policy directions. This underpins GoC’s stated intention to refocus i t s efforts on
economic development and poverty reduction, a necessity made all the more stark by
stagnating growth and persistent poverty over the previous CAS period. While significant
reforms were undertaken over the period since the last CAS was elaborated, including reforms
under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Completion point in 2006, and the successful
2005-2009 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
program, much remains to be done to improve development effectiveness and transparent,
efficient use o f resources in order to unlock Cameroon’s potential.
2.
On the World Bank side, the institution i s poised to transform the way that i t engages
with Cameroon, evolving into a trusted partner that continues to provide pragmatic, strategic,
and focused investment lending and analytic and advisory activities. This CAS mirrors
Government’s vision for economic growth, but in a manner that produces benefits for all
Cameroonians, expressed as this CAS’ umbrella o f “Inclusive Growth”. The Cameroonian
economy needs to not only maintain i t s delicate equilibrium in these trying times, but make
strides to transform into a more robust, diversified, and competitive economy. Service delivery
too demands improvement in terms o f access and quality o f services. Last, both government
strategy documents and the CAS i t s e l f acknowledge the key role that governance w i l l play in
this transformation.
I. Cameroon: Vast potential, but with constraints
3.
Cameroon i s a linguistically and ethnically diverse country whose geography ranges
from Sahelian semi-desert in the north through grassland to equatorial forest in the south. This
diversity favors varied economic and agricultural activities, though in reality 70 percent o f the
population depends on agriculture and pastoral activities for their livelihood. Cameroon has one
o f the highest proportions o f land area devoted to conservation in Africa, with some 14 percent
o f the country’s territory designated as national parks, reserves, sanctuaries and conservation
concessions. Cameroon also exports oil and has significant natural resources, including highvalue timber species; agricultural products including coffee, cotton, and cocoa; and as yet
untapped natural gas, iron, bauxite, and cobalt.

1

A. Political Conditions
4.
Since i t s independence, Cameroon has enjoyed a degree o f political stability that i s
unusual for sub-Saharan Africa. I t s first President, Ahmadou Ahidjo, remained in office until
1982, and was peacefully succeeded by Paul Biya, who founded the Cameroon People’s
Democratic Movement and ran a single party system. Following popular unrest, a multi-party
system was introduced in 1990. Mr. Biya won multiparty polls in 1992, and in 1996 introduced
a new Constitution that extended presidential term limits to two seven-year terms. Mr. Biya
comfortably won the 1997 elections (which were boycotted by the main opposition parties) and
subsequently the 2004 elections. In April 2008, Parliament approved a controversial
constitutional amendment removing the term limit for the President amidst protests .from the
opposition and civil society. This now enables the incumbent to seek re-election at the next
presidential elections due in 20 11.
B. Economic Conditions
5.
Macroeconomic Management. Cameroon i s a member o f a monetary union with a
supranational central bank, conducting monetary policy consistent with the peg to the Euro.
Fiscal policy i s thus the main instrument available to the authorities. In this regard, their
medium-term fiscal strategy reflects the nonrenewable nature o f o i l revenues and the need to
address obstacles to growth, while preserving debt sustainability. The strategy aims at limiting
fiscal deficits while o i l revenues are significant so that future generations are not faced with a
renewed debt burden. O i l revenues and available prudent borrowing should be effectively used
to finance growth-enhancing investments. This strategy i s ensured by maintaining a moderately
positive non-oil current fiscal balance and by avoiding sizable overall fiscal deficits for as long
as oil revenues remain substantial. Finally, fluctuations in the non-oil primary balance are
contained to avoid destabilizing effects on the economy.

6.
Debt Sustainability. Cameroon’s debt situation has sharply improved in recent years.
I t s public debt-to- GDP ratio declined from 51.8 percent in 2005 to 9.8 percent in 2008
(US$2.28 billion), thanks to HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) relief in 2006
and prudent borrowing policies since then. Since the HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt relief, the
further decline in external debt has reflected the following: (i)a reduction in net borrowing by
public enterprises; (ii)the settlement o f most London Club commercial creditors; and (iii)
valuation effects due to changes in the exchange rate. O n domestic debt, substantial repayments
were also made possible due to the use o f windfall gains from higher-than-expected o i l prices
in 2008.

7.
Though the composition o f external public debt i s currently skewed toward bilateral
debt, it appears sustainable. Under a baseline scenario, all debt indicators remain below their
thresholds through 2029. As such, Cameroon’s risk o f debt distress remains low. However,
because o f the global financial crisis and economic slowdown, debt indicators are somewhat
higher than in the 2008 analysis. I t i s also noteworthy that persistent weakness in public finance
management and insufficient data coverage remain areas o f vulnerability in Cameroon’s
assessment. In particular, quasi-fiscal liabilities o f state-owned enterprises are not transparent
and represent a possible build-up o f new arrears. In addition, continued efforts to achieve

greater non-oil revenue mobilization and to widen the export base are s t i l l a challenge, given
the expected long-run decline in o i l revenue.

8,
Recent Economic Developments. Cameroon’s macroeconomic performance has
strengthened in recent years. Debt r e l i e f in 2006 under the HIPC and MDRI helped firm up the
country’s debt sustainability, and create fiscal space for spending targeted on poverty
r e d ~ c t i o nPublic
.~
expenditure management i s slightly more transparent, and the financial sector
stronger. Prudent management o f o i l earnings and revenue has allowed the authorities to
accumulate government deposits at the regional central bank (BEAC) and to contribute to the
currency union’s pool o f foreign exchange reserves, while raising public investment and
normalizing relations with creditors.

The country’s growth achievement remains nevertheless disappointing. Despite the
progress made to consolidate macroeconomic stability, poor infrastructure and an unfavorable
business environment s t i l l hamper economic activity and make it difficult to reach the growth
rates needed to reduce poverty on a sustainable basis. GDP growth between 2003 and 2007 was
limited (3.3 percent on average per annum), and remained below the average annual growth
rate o f 4.2 percent achieved between 2000 and 2002. In per capita terms, real GDP grew by

Cameroon’s public debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 5 1.8 percent in 2005 to 9.8 percent in 2008 (US$2.28
billion). Substantial repayments were also made on domestic debt, using windfall gains from higher-than-expected
oil revenue (Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis, June 12,2009).

only 0.6 percent on average between 2000 and 2007. As a result, extreme poverty remained
unchanged and even worsened in rural areas. O n its current trajectory, Cameroon i s unlikely to
meet any o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), with the possible exception o f that o f
universal primary education.
10.
The Global Financial Crisis. Cameroon is being adversely affected by the global
economic crisis through lower commodity prices and external demand, and tighter external
financing affecting major investments. Lower world demand and prices for key commodities
(e.g. timber, rubber, cotton), as well as lower-than-expected o i l production, have led to a
downward revision o f export earnings in 2009. The fall in commodity prices could also affect
growth prospects in the outer years because it could delay investments in the oil and mining
sectors. The current account deficit i s projected to widen to about 6.9 percent o f GDP and
economic growth to slow to about 2.4 percent. Lower o i l revenue will also turn the overall
fiscal balance into a deficit o f about 2 percent o f GDP, as public spending was maintained at i t s
budgeted level (with the exception o f the elimination o f subsidies on fuel prices). Although
declining, headline inflation reached 4.3 percent (year-on-year) in June, driven mainly by
higher food prices.

1 1.
Medium-term prospects. In 2010, the external position is expected to improve on the
back o f stronger external demand and higher expected o i l prices. The main risks to this outlook
relate to (i)a further worsening or longer duration o f the global downturn, and (ii)the
upcoming presidential elections in 201 1 that could delay the implementation o f the needed
policy reforms and lead to additional spending pressures. The authorities recognize that a
broader structural reform agenda remains unfinished, holding back the economy from reaching
the faster growth rates needed to reduce poverty. They have stressed their resolve to revive
economic activity, while preserving macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. The
newly-adopted growth and employment strategy focuses on the need to alleviate the
bottlenecks to growth, especially in infrastructure, refocus public spending on priority areas,
strengthen the place and quality o f public investment, and improve the business environment.
12.
The medium-term scenario is subject to significant downside risks. Government policy
documents might be underestimating financing requirements. The projected path o f private
investment assumes a very rapid response o f the private sector to the reforms aimed at
improving the business environment. Should this projection not materialize, public investment
may need to compensate for the shortfall. Public expenditure policy will be geared towards
containing total current spending and reorienting outlays to productive uses, including
infrastructure investment, but savings across various expenditure categories remain undefined.
Policy documents recognize the declining importance o f o i l revenue and trade taxes, and stress
the need to achieve greater nonoil revenue mobilization. At the same time, however, a number
o f fiscal incentives are envisaged, further eroding an already narrow tax base. Planned public
spending could therefore result in overall external and fiscal deficits putting substantial
pressure on the country’s notional foreign exchange reserves and on government deposits.

C. Governance Conditions

13.
Evidence shows Cameroon’s weak track record with respect to stimulating growth.
Despite the country’s tremendous natural, human, and financial resources, economic
performance remains decidedly modest. Non-oil growth has averaged only 4.2 percent over the
past 5 years, well below Government’s ambitions, which sets its future annual goal at 10
percent. Statistics also show that what little growth i s generated is not being distributed in an
equitable, pro-poor manner. At least one explanation for this i s governance, which continues to
pose a major challenge to Cameroon’s development potential. Kaufmann-Kraay Governance
indicators show that Cameroon ranks under the 25‘h percentile for all criteria, with control o f
corruption at the 19th percentile, government effectiveness at the 20th percentile, and voice and
accountability at the 19‘h percentile. Cameroon’s IDA Resource Allocation index for 2008 i s at
3.2 which i s the borderline o f ratings for fragile states. Its sub-ratings on “transparency,
accountability, and corruption in the public sector” and “property rights and rule-based
governance” both stand at 2.5. Starting a business in Cameroon i s a daunting task (Cameroon
ranks 17 1st out o f 183 countries in the Doing Business Index), and enforcing a contract requires
43 steps and 800 days.
D. Social Conditions
14.
While Cameroon i s on track to meet the MDG on primary enrollment, issues remain
with regard to educational quality, with a high pupil to teacher ratio, a lack o f adequate learning
materials, etc. Cameroon’s expenditure on education has grown since 2000 by taking advantage
o f funds released through debt relief. The main results include the construction o f 3,500 new
classrooms to reduce overcrowding; salary increases to motivate teachers; recruitment o f
additional teachers; and the provision each year o f a minimum package o f school supplies to all
schools. Both enrollment rates and completion rates have improved at the primary levels, as has
gender equity. Cameroon has made impressive strides in ensuring girls’ access to education,
with a female to male ratio o f 85 percent in primary and secondary education. Furthermore, the
sector has made great strides in equitable efficiency by deploying new contract teachers to
schools with the greatest needs, thus reducing the variation o f the pupil-teacher ratios. The
government eliminated school fees for primary school pupils 1999. This has led to an increase
in gross primary school enrolment to over 100 percent, but problems remain. Governance
constraints also impact the effectiveness o f the education system across the sector. Stakeholders
do not have easy access to timely and useful information on the state o f the education system,
accountability mechanisms that oblige authorities at all levels to make relevant changes or
opportunities to participate in the decision-making process.

15.
Cameroon i s experiencing rapid population growth at 2.7 percent and a high fertility
rate that averages five children per woman. There are large geographical variations with the
total fertility rate (TFR) being as high as 6.1 children per woman in rural areas. The high TFR
i s partly a function o f a l o w overall contraceptive prevalence rate, which i s 14 percent
nationwide but only 3 percent in the Northern and Extreme Northern Regions. Reducing
fertility rates will have many benefits as it can be expected to: (i)
improve women’s health and
reduce overall maternal mortality by reducing the number o f high order births (fourth, fifth and
higher births) which are much riskier than l o w order births; (ii)reduce infant mortality rates b y
increasing the interval between births; (iii)help empower women by providing them with
choices about when and how many children to have; (iv) provide a necessary condition for
sustained and rapid economic growth by decreasing the dependency ratio and by facilitating the

5

formation o f human capital (by allowing greater per child expenditures on education and
health); and (v) reduce population pressures that further stress the fragile ecosystems o f the
country (e.g. access to land, deforestation, food, and water supply, etc).
16.

Broader health outcomes are out o f synch with the country’s potential and expenditures

in the sector. National statistical data hide large geographical and socioeconomic disparities in
service delivery. Most key indicators o f child health and nutrition have actually worsened since
1990 with a few exceptions (e.g., immunization). The HIV/AIDS epidemic increases the risk o f
exacerbating the poor health outcomes, with current seroprevalency estimates at 5.1 per~ent.~

Cameroon’s overall epidemiologic profile corresponds to countries that spend dramatically
less, reflecting important inefficiencies in the allocation o f resources and in the production o f
health services as well as major inequities in the distribution o f human resources and the state
o f facilities. The gender dimensions o f the health challenge are striking, with maternal
mortality at approximately 1,000 per 100,000 live births. Not surprisingly, health sector
performance i s also hindered by governance issues, and monitoring and evaluation o f health
sector performance remains weak.

17.
Cameroonians are increasingly living in urban areas, with a 56 percent urbanization rate
in 2007, compared with only 26.9 percent in 1975. Urban population growth remains high,
exceeding 6 percent per annum according to some estimates, compared with 2.1 percent for the
population as a whole. Douala and the capital city, Yaounde, are the main urban centers, with
populations o f 2 million and 1.7 million respectively. Urban growth occurred largely without
the necessary investment in infrastructure, resulting in the growth o f informal suburban
settlements that offer a low standard o f living. Cameroon’s population i s young: an estimated
41 -2 percent are under the age o f 15, and 96.7 percent are under 65.
18.
Annex 4 shows that Cameroon continues to lag with respect to achieving the
Millennium Development Goals, which underscores the difficulty in gearing public policy
toward a focused effort at ensuring that the poorest benefit from the country’s modest growth.
Only one MDG i s within reach by 2015, but only if reforms are sustained related to ensuring
universal primary education. Indicators relating to gender equality and women’s empowerment,
maternal mortality, child health and reduction o f malaria and other major disease incidence will
not be met. Finally, the goal that seeks to halve the population living below the poverty line i s
also unlikely to be met.

E. Poverty and Inequality
19.
As previously noted, recent household data demonstrates that the average Cameroonian
i s no better o f f than they were in 200 1, with poverty rates virtually stagnating from 200 1-2007
at 39.9 percent6 The survey also revealed that more than 55 percent o f rural households are
poor, as compared to only about 12 percent o f urban ones (changing from 52 and 17 percent,
respectively, in 2001). As a result 87 percent o f the poor were living in rural areas in 2007, up
from 82 percent in 2001. However, these analyses may mask broader challenges faced by the
burgeoning urban population, whose cost o f living i s generally higher than that o f rural

inhabitants, but which i s not taken into account when calculating these poverty rates. This lack
o f progress on poverty reduction since 2001 i s not surprising given 0.6 percent real growth over
the period, governance problems, and highly centralized budget execution, resulting in
compromised development outcomes in peripheral areas o f the country.
20.
Poverty analysis7 also demonstrates that Cameroon i s characterized by economic
growth that has strong spatial and geographic dimensions, including regional disparity and a
decline o f the agricultural sector. In essence, the poor continue to be worse off, while the
wealthy fare relatively better, underscoring the inability o f the state to ensure an equitable
allocation o f resources to fight poverty. For example, the poverty incidence in four regions
(Adamaoua, East, North and Extreme North) experienced a significant increase between 200 1
and 2007 while the overall poverty trend was stagnating. The two Northern regions (North and
Extreme North) saw the biggest increase, o f 13.6 and 9.6 percentage points respectively. These
points underscore that poverty i s not being addressed in a comprehensive manner. This calls
into question the implementation effectiveness o f the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), and underscores the need for interventions that are both geographically and sectorally
targeted.

According to recent data from the National Statistics Office, the informal sector n o w
employs about 7 million workers, accounting for over 90 percent o f all employment. Reliable
data on the sector are unavailable, but it i s generally believed to account for over 60 percent o f
economic output, with many estimates putting i t s contribution even higher. While the
unemployment rate in 2005 in urban areas (10.7 percent) and in the two largest cities, Douala
(12.5 percent) and Yaounde (14.7 percent), i s worrisome, the underemployment rate stands at
over 75 percent. The informal sector appears to have grown over recent years as policies to
stimulate the formal economy have largely failed. The apparent growth o f the informal sector is
increasing pressure on the government to promote policies that recognize its economic
importance, in particular by helping informal businesses to gain access to credit, social
protection schemes and training.

11. Cameroon’s main development challenges and opportunities
22.
Cameroon’s central challenge i s to stimulate a robust rate o f growth, and to ensure this
i s equitably shared amongst the population in order to reduce poverty. The country’s
governance deficit constitutes a major obstacle in achieving this, as evidenced in weak public
expenditure management and a highly centralized state machinery that has few downward
linkages to those most in need. A poor business climate undermines Cameroon’s
competitiveness and growth prospects, as does significant underinvestment in critical
infrastructure that could improve service delivery and broader economic growth both at
national and regional levels. To that end, Cameroon’s economy must become more robust and
competitive, creating a favorable environment to ensure the sustainable and transparent use o f
the country’s considerable natural resources. Such reform would attract key investments in
several areas, including mining, tourism, and small and medium enterprises linked to
agribusiness and industry (wood transformation, textiles). In the medium-term, Cameroon must
transform i t s natural capital into human and productive capital in order to achieve i t s
aspirations to become a middle income country by 2035.
A. Improving governance to achieve inclusive growth
23.
Cameroon’s poor reputation for governance i s grounded in a severe breakdown o f
public accountability. Checks against fraud and corruption are weak, and a lack o f information
makes it difficult for citizens and civil society to hold governments accountable. Little
information i s made public on development performance indicators. The public i s not consulted
before enactment o f legislation or given a role in the oversight o f public expenditures. Citizens
have difficulty holding elected officials and the executive branch o f government accountable,
and the answerability o f service providers to elected officials i s also flawed. Though Cameroon
has a reasonably sound legal system, a disconnect exists between laws and their
implementation. Regulations often subvert the intent o f the law, and laws are not adequately
enforced.

24.
Most observers agree that the main obstacle to growth in Cameroon at this time i s
governance. As previously cited, a culture o f impunity and patron-client relationships pervades
many economic transactions and levels o f society. The “rules o f the game” that would
encourage transparency and due process are either unclear, unknown, or not respected. As such,
the growth seen today i s both far under i t s potential and subsequently, the benefits o f growth
are channeled to those .least in need o f it. The government recognizes in i t s public policy
statements that governance i s a principal constraint to an improved growth performance.
Governance failures constrain growth through three principal mechanisms. First, they adversely
affect the investment climate in a variety o f ways. Second, they increase the cost o f doing
business in Cameroon, and hence reduce cost-competitiveness. Third, poor public financial
management and an inefficient and sometimes corrupt civil service reduce the resources
available to finance public investment and the effectiveness o f public service delivery.
B. Weak public expenditure management
25.
Deficiencies in public financial management contribute to Cameroon’s disappointing
economic growth, hampering the efficient use o f resources available to finance public
investment and service delivery. Recent analysis suggests that progress has been made in
budget preparation, but problems remain with budget execution and controls. With respect to
the capital budget, for instance, a new procurement code has brought some improvement and a
8

regulatory agency for procurement i s n o w fully operational. However, limited internal controls,
weak accounting and reporting, and an absence o f adequate external audit, hinders transparency
and accountability. Funds are also often released late in the fiscal year, resulting in excessive
use o f ad hoc regulations and exceptional procedures. Intergovernmental transfers lack
transparency and local governments often have inadequate financial resources to meet their
spending responsibilities.

26.

A lack o f information makes it difficult for citizens and c i v i l society to hold
governments accountable. The quality and timeliness o f in-year budget reports and annual
financial statements i s deficient. External scrutiny i s weak with the Chamber o f Accounts and
the National Assembly having limited access to relevant financial and budget information and
no capacity to undertake their constitutional audit and oversight roles. Audit reports are not
publicly available and l i t t l e information i s made public on development performance indicators.
As in many developing countries, the task o f delivering services i s undercut by the inadequate
funding and corruption. Lack o f comprehensiveness and transparency o f the budget (with
significant expenditures o f f budget), large gaps between anticipated and actual revenue
collections, and weak control over payrolls play ‘a role in reducing the funds available for
service delivery and public investment.
C. Over-centralization o f decision-making and execution
27.
Cameroon’s administration i s seen as more capable than most o f its neighbors, yet i t i s
perceived as excessively centralized with few downward accountability mechanisms. While
Cameroon’s basic decentralization legislation i s considered adequate, most o f it i s yet to be
acted upon, notably on fiscal decentralization, staffing and organization o f local governments,
and deployment o f deconcentrated staff. Local government i s bogged down by the typical
issues in decentralizing highly-concentrated francophone states. Current issues partly stem
from the superimposition o f a devolved structure onto a deconcentrated state. The
government’s decentralization strategy recognizes in principle the need for devolving spending
responsibilities to local governments while transferring at the same time the appropriate
resources to meet these new responsibilities and avoid unfunded mandates. The nature o f these
resources seems, however, unclear, as well as the design o f any equalization transfer
mechanism to allow all local governments to deliver the same quality o f public services
irrespective o f their own revenue base. In addition, the borrowing policy o f local governments
and the mechanism b y which the center will enforce hard budget constraints need to be
developed.

28.
Although the government allocates roughly 30 percent o f the investment spending to the
regions, it re-centralizes t w o thirds o f this budget. O n average, each region controls around 1
percent o f the total investment budget. The high centralization rates are often rationalized by
the lack o f capacity at the local level, the absence o f “local” f i r m s that can deliver adequate
goods and services, or economies o f scale brought about by large purchases only the central
government can make. However, the large network o f more than 350 local treasuries, along
with the fact that local governments have been dealing with public procurement issues since at
least 2002 does not lend support to the over-centralization o f the investment budget.
29.

Because local governments have superior information about local needs than the remote
central administration, they are better able to identify, and given appropriate capacity, deliver

9

the services their constituents want and need, and decentralizing spending would enhance
economic efficiency. Over time, the efficiency gains at the local level would lead to better
services and faster economic growth at both the local and national levels. The government has
vowed to further the decentralization o f investment spending in the 2010 budget, but it remains
to be seen if the requisite human and financial resources will actually be transferred. The scope,
pace, and nature o f the transfer o f human and financial resources will need to be carefully
managed in order to ensure that decentralization results in better development outcomes at the
local level.

D.. Underinvestment in infrastructure
30.
As previously noted, Cameroon urgently needs to upgrade i t s infrastructure, as it
constitutes a major bottleneck for competitiveness and growth. I t i s only through improved
access to markets and services, greater reliability and lower costs that connectivity and
productivity will increase. Public investment could yield important social and economic
returns. Through spending on economic and social infrastructure, a government can provide a
strong boost to GDP growth and poverty reduction. However, for capital spending to contribute
to growth, i t has to be effective and efficient. Analysis shows that planned public investment in
infrastructure has increased markedly from 2004 to 2008, from less than 20 percent in 2004 to
more than 40 percent in 2008. Infrastructure, however, represents a much smaller share o f the
treasury payments; it represented 45 percent o f the planned investment outlays in 2008, only 19
percent o f the actual payments went for infrastructure that same year.’’
31.
None o f the government’s priority sectors escape this pattern. In energy, Cameroon’s
hydropower potential i s the third largest in Sub-Saharan Africa, estimated in excess o f 12,000
megawatts. However, the total installed electricity generation capacity i s only 933 megawatts,
77 percent o f which i s hydro capacity and the remainder costly thermal capacity (diesel and
heavy fuel oil). In telecommunications, the sector i s dominated by the state-owned operator
Camtel and most other operators do not have broadband terrestrial networks and rely on
expensive and poor quality satellite connectivity or microwave backbones to link cities at the
national level. Transport costs within Cameroon and in the C E M A C sub-region are among the
highest in the world (up to US$0.20 per ton-kilometer compared to US$O.lO per ton-kilometer
for East African landlocked countries). Because o f the lack o f financial resources, only 29
percent o f priority roads are consistently maintained and the overall condition o f the road
network i s deteriorating.

E. Competitiveness lagging, but possibilities are there
32.
Cameroon’s economy presents a paradox, whereby it possesses a massive resource
base, but does not transform this into sustained economic growth or poverty reduction. The
government recognizes the critical importance o f the private sector for achieving the higher
growth rates needed to reduce poverty. Policy documents, however, project private investment
that i s significantly higher than i t s historical average and i s not expected to be accompanied by
a similar expansion in the public sector’s contribution to gross capital formation. The private
sector requires a favorable investment climate in order to play a crucial role in making
Cameroon more competitive. However, conditions are at present decidedly not working in its
favor, as highlighted by the 2010 Doing Business Report. Cameroon’s overall ranking places it
10

Cameroon: Fiscal Policy for Growth and Development. Washington, DC, World Bank, 2009.

10

at 171” o f 183 countries, with particularly l o w rankings for Starting a Business (174‘h),
Enforcing Contracts (1 74‘h) and Paying Taxes (170fh). These facts, coupled with the reality that
most have stagnated or gotten worse in recent years, underscore that Cameroon’s attractiveness
for the private sector i s eroding relative to other countries. The 2009 Enterprise Survey tells
much the same story, whereby f i r m s report that dealing with government regulation
requirements represents 7 percent o f senior management time, 5 1 percent acknowledge making
informal payments to public officials “to get things done” and 70.4 percent indicate that a
typical firm reports less than 100 percent o f sales for tax purposes. In order to attract the
meaningful private investment that i s envisaged in i t s policy documents, these trends must be
reversed. Significant reform measures must be taken in order to make Cameroon a vastly more
attractive investment opportunity.
33.
Given a favorable investment climate, several areas o f the economy could boost
competitiveness, including the urban economy, agriculture, and mining. The urban economy
has been shown to contribute greatly to economic growth. For example, the contribution o f
greater Douala to the country’s GDP i s estimated at 60 percent, and the overall contribution o f
the country’s urban informal economy i s estimated at one-third o f GDP. Though possessing
enormous potential, human capital production, mobilization and accountability are binding
constraints to economic growth in Cameroon and demand improvement. The agriculture sector
too holds considerable potential, but faces important constraints. Several value chains could
develop if structural constraints and weaknesses in market linkages are adequately addressed.
These constraints include poor infrastructure (production, marketing, transportation); limited
control o f improved production techniques and poor economic management skills; weak
investment capacity; limited use o f improved inputs; limited organization o f producers, weak
linkages to markets and limited development o f value-adding activities such as processing and
warehousing. The mining sector also constitutes a viable source o f economic growth. The
country’s mineral resources include nickel, cobalt, iron ore, bauxite, diamonds, gold, limestone,
marble and uranium, among others. During the global commodity prices boom, private sector
interest in Cameroon’s geological potential spiked and a number o f investors explored various
projects in the country. Despite the recent commodity downturn, investor interest in
Cameroon’s mining sector remains strong and new investments are likely to come online given
favorable global market conditions.

11

F. Enormous natural resource potential; the threat posed by climate change
34.
Cameroon i s endowed with abundant natural resources and diverse ecosystems that
present tremendous opportunities and challenges to ensure their sustainability. As Figure 1
shows,
the

resources, i t i s not

that
climate change also
poses threats. The
country recently adopted a National Desertification Control Plan, underscoring the
vulnerability o f the coastal and semi-arid Sahelian areas concerning climate change. Policy
documents outline government intentions to implement a number o f actions aimed at managing
and regenerating state-owned forests in order to enhance forest and wildlife resources, protect
soil fertility, conserve water resources, protect grazing land, and safeguard biodiversity. In
addition, the Congo Basin countries agreed on pooling resources in order to coordinate their
climate policy.

12

G. Regional integration as a catalyst for growth
35.
Given Cameroon’s strategic geographic position vis-a-vis its neighbors and the size and
structure o f i t s economy, it i s positioned to play a leading and catalytic role in fostering robust
regional integration in central Africa. In particular, enormous potential exists for the promotion
o f commercial relations in the framework o f the Communaute‘ Economique des Etats d’APique
Centrale (CEAAC) and the Communaute‘ Economique et Mone‘taire de 1‘Afrique Centrale
(CEMAC), and reinforcing relations with Nigeria. Strengthened regional integration could
improve competitiveness and help member countries successfully attract investment and have
better access to global markets. Closer integration would also bring greater stability and
reduced price volatility that was shown to be quite taxing on the rural population in 2008.
Important efforts have been undertaken to date to strengthen the customs union; to improve
clearing procedures at the port o f Douala; and to facilitate transport along strategic transit axes
to boost regional trade with Chad and the Central African Republic. These economic
integration efforts are being strengthened in particular in the context o f the preparation o f the
CEMAC Regional Economic Program which aims at making the sub-region an emerging
integrated and competitive economic space.

36.
A holistic treatment o f the transport network that includes linkages between the road
network and portshailways w i l l make tremendous inroads in promoting greater regional
integration. This could include a stronger emphasis on the development o f concrete plans for
the construction or rehabilitation o f selected ports and railways, and a focus on policy reforms
to facilitate trade across borders. Given i t s significant hydropower potential, Cameroon also has
the potential to play a leading role in the development o f the Central African Power Pool
(CAPP). To leverage this, interconnection agreements with neighboring states remain to be
signed, market rules to be established, and capacity for regional coordination and planning to
be built. Other areas where regional approaches can unlock additional growth opportunities for
Cameroon and on which countries o f the sub-region are collaboratively working on include
information and communications technology (ICT) and agriculture.

111. Cameroon’s Vision for Growth and Development
37.
The Government o f Cameroon has an ambitious future planned, as reflected in i t s
“Vision 2035”. This policy document serves as the long-term anchor for the new PRSP, and
envisions Cameroon as an “emerging nation, democratic and united in i t s diversity” by 2035.
I t s principle objectives include: (i)reducing poverty to less than 10%; (ii)
becoming a middleincome country; (iii)being an industrialized nation; and (iv) consolidating democracy and
national unity.
The recently completed PRSP,” the Growth and Employment Strategy (Document de
strate‘gie pour la croissance et 1 ’emploi - DSCE) identifies weak productivity, a looming
energy crisis and effects o f the financial crisis, food insecurity, stagnating poverty, and high
unemployment as key challenges facing the period in question (2009-2019). It envisions
significant investment in infrastructure to stimulate growth, notably in energy, roads, port
infrastructure, water supply, and information technology. Productive increases are sought in
agriculture and livestock farming, mining (notably in bauxite, iron, and cobalt), key value
chains (timber, ICT, tourism), and in the business climate. It looks to strengthen human

The DSCE was approved by an InterministerialCommittee on August 26,2009.

13

development and develop more robust formal sector employment. The DSCE also places
important emphasis on regional integration and envisions strengthened partnerships with nontraditional donors (BRICs plus Korea; the Islamic world). Finally, it dedicates an entire chapter
to improving governance, including specific initiatives related to corruption, public
procurement, business climate, and civic participation. The new strategy aims to adjust the
overall objectives and address the weaknesses o f the various policies including covering some
areas that had not been prioritized in the first round, including energy, telecommunications,
rural development and governance.
39.
A draft Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) underscores that the DSCE correctly
identifies the country’s inadequate infrastructure and unfavorable business environment as the
main structural weaknesses hampering faster economic growth and employment. The JSAN
also states the view that DSCE outlines a comprehensive framework for growth and
employment in Cameroon. The document lays emphasis on infrastructure, rural development
and governance to accelerate growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability. I t also
identifies that further work i s needed to strengthen the implementation tools o f the strategy.
Priority areas are: (i)strengthening the macroeconomic framework especially i t s medium-term
fiscal framework and growth assumptions set out in the strategy; (ii)strengthening the link
between the DSCE, the MTEF and the annual budgets; (iii)deepening the strategy by
prioritizing actions needed to accelerate pro-poor and private sector investment; (iv) ensuring
the adequate resources for the medium to long-term objectives (infrastructures, rural
development and human, development), and (v) strengthening the implementation o f the
Governance and Anti-corruption program.

IV. The Bank Group Assistance Strategy
40.
The dialogue between the World Bank and the Government o f Cameroon (GoC) i s at a
critical juncture. The Bank continues to be reminded o f austerity measures associated with
structural adjustment and the HIPC process in Cameroon, while the government i s asserting
i t s e l f in taking ownership over i t s economic future. The resulting dialogue at times presents a
paradox, whereby the Bank i s acknowledged as a strong, trusted partner behind closed doors,
but in public i s often blamed for Cameroon’s economic malaise o f the last decade. Since
reaching the HIPC Completion Point in 2006, Cameroon has enjoyed substantial debt r e l i e f
(US$1.15 billion since 2000) from the HIPC, the MDRI and additional debt relief from the
Paris Club creditors. However, these same institutions have noted a marked reduction in their
policy leverage with the government, as new overseas development assistance earmarked for
Cameroon has stagnated while government revenues, particularly from oil, mushroomed. With
an annual budget o f approximately US$6 billion, the government’s resources dwarf that
available from traditional international assistance sources (approximately US$400 million o f
commitments per annum, excluding debt relief), including IDA’S annualized allocation o f
approximately US$IOO million. Cameroon therefore finds itself with substantially more fiscal
space than in the past, thanks to a lower debt burden and i t s recent windfall oil revenues.
41.
As a result, the role o f the World Bank in helping Cameroon reach i t s objectives has
evolved into that o f a key advisor and a catalyst for attracting investors to large projects. The
Bank needs to demonstrate i t s analytical excellence as well as its leadership on complex
operations in order to remain a key and trusted partner for Cameroon. The CAS outlines a
selective set o f engagements that lay the foundation to influence reform and progress in key
14

sectors. The CAS also incorporates important lessons, both from experience during the last
CAS period, from the CAS consultations, and a recent Client Survey.

A. Implementationo f the last CAS and lessons learned
42.
A recently completed CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) covering the previous CAS
(from 2003 to 2006) and the I S N for Fiscal Years 2007 and 2008, identified several important
lessons learned that have been taken into account for the current strategy. The CAS CR states
that Cameroon’s uneven performance during the CAS period resulted in a slower than
anticipated delivery o f new operations, making outcomes difficult to achieve. As reflected in
deteriorating disbursement ratios, many o f the planned projects experienced delays in start up
and implementation effectiveness during the ISN period, suggesting that actual contributions
are going to be felt mostly after the review period. A Client Survey has also greatly informed
strategy preparation and the directions where the Bank will engage differently and do more.
43.

Key lessons for the World Bank engagement in Cameroon include:
Simpler project design to ensure a fit with the government’s implementation capacity.
More flexible project designs may be appropriate in areas where the Bank has been
largely absent from substantive policy dialogue over time.
Bank teams should be attentive to the frequent disparity in commitment between the
political and administrative levels. IEG reviews indicated the importance o f effective
supervision and monitoring and evaluation systems with a recommendation to withdraw
from certain projects if considerable opposition and delay are encountered.
Though the previous CAS had a solid results orientation, many o f the envisaged outcomes
were either too ambitious or the
associated projects/activities were not
undertaken during the CAS period. As
a result, this CAS Results Framework
takes into account the existing portfolio
along with the activity pipeline.

The CAS CR, a Client SuGey, and CAS Consultations underscored the need for the Bank
to deepen i t s engagement on governance. Lessons learned from the multi-donor supported

-

15

CHOC Program demonstrate that governance should not only be tackled in a punitive
sense, but rather as a collective challenge that necessitates activities that model good
behavior, and fora to discuss and debate such behavior change. Given i t s importance,
governance constitutes a cross-cutting theme within the CAS itself.
44.
The results o f the Client Survey inform and confirm the strategic choices and directions
o f the World Bank in the CAS period. The survey found that the overarching issues that
concern stakeholders in Cameroon revolve around governance, corruption, and agricultural
development. The survey also demonstrates that private sector and the country’s business
climate are o f utmost importance to stakeholders. These issues all emerged as far more
important than health and education.
45.
Infrastructure i s recognized as critical to growth and poverty reduction as well. The
majority o f respondents across all stakeholder groups indicated that the World Bank should be
more involved in Cameroon’s development activities. The survey suggests that stakeholders
believe it would be most productive for the Bank to focus i t s resources on issues identified as
high priority ones: governance, infrastructure, and to a lesser degree agriculture. In other
words, stakeholders see a role for the Bank in the areas that they regard as absolutely essential
for sustainable growth and poverty reduction.
46.
Based on insights gleaned from the survey and consultation process, the World Bank is
committed to taking corrective action so as to not repeat past mistakes. As such, the Bank has
been selective and focused in identifying i t s pipeline o f new activities, and will put an emphasis
on development outcomes - insisting on tangible results, and rewarding those who demonstrate
them. Additional financing or new phases o f existing operations will be supported, provided
that outcomes to date have been satisfactory. This will encourage selectivity, continuity, and
the timeliness and quality o f outcomes.
B. Current Bank Portfolio’2
47.
The current Cameroon portfolio represents a total o f US$764 million in commitments,
which includes US$384 million for 12 projects (IDA & GEF), four regional projects totaling
US$371 million, and five Trust Funded activities totaling US$8.3 million. US$704 million
remains undisbursed, reflecting both

problems with counterpart funding availability. Actions ‘to remedy these weaknesses are
identified in collaboration with the government, and often include targeted training supported
with human and financial resources from the World Bank.

C. Proposed Assistance Strategy
49.
The World Bank has aligned i t s Country Assistance Strategy with the latest iteration o f
the government’s poverty reduction strategy, the “Growth and Employment Strategy”.
Achieving this synergy, while responding to a challenging country context, necessitates that
World Bank engagement not just focus on helping catalyze growth, but that the institution use
its policy leverage and financial resources to ensure that said growth i s shared in an equitable
manner.
Figure 3. The CAS Framework

50.

As Figure 3 illustrates, the World Bank will help stimulate growth by improving the
competitiveness o f the Cameroonian economy through a cross-cutting governance theme and
two main pillars. Interventions w i l l seek to improve core governance, including public finance
management; undertake pragmatic diagnostics and analytic work that champions ‘good
behavior’ at the sector level; and lead a frank, transparent dialogue with the government and
development partners about the governance challenge and how to overcome it. Infrastructure
investments w i l l improve access to energy, telecommunications, and trade corridors, while
focused interventions will improve the transparency and sustainability o f investments in
protected areas, energy, and mining, and protected areas. The Bank seeks to support the
establishment o f processes that aim to achieve equitable growth, as measured through improved
service delivery and development outcomes. This may take the form o f decentralized
approaches where urban and rural local governments are held accountable for results, and
where social sector outcomes improve and basic infrastructure services are delivered and
maintained.

51.

i. A Strategy Grounded in Governance
As explained in earlier sections, Cameroon’s greatest challenge to growth and

development i s governance. The pervasiveness o f bad governance affects most economic
transactions. The World Bank w i l l tackle this issue in a cross-cutting, pragmatic, and
comprehensive manner. The Bank will continue i t s important engagement on core governance
(including public finance management), deepen its work on governance in different sectors, and

17

aim to mainstream a governance dialogue into i t s activities so as to create an enabling
environment for change in the medium-term.

52.
Improving core governance. A main objective o f the Bank’s governance program over
the CAS period will be to help Cameroon better manage i t s financial resources, so that fiscal
policy can become an enabler o f inclusive growth. In addition to delivering stability, sound
macroeconomic management should help Cameroon to weather unanticipated adverse crises
such as the current financial crisis. In that context, the Bank will work jointly with IMF to help
maintain debt sustainability. The Bank will also advise on a balanced composition o f
expenditures that could prevent an appreciation o f the real exchange rate, thus protecting the
competitiveness o f the economy. In turn, these actions will strengthen Cameroon’s resilience to
adverse shocks.
Operationally, the Bank’s focus will continue to be o n public finance management, in
line with the objectives o f the government reform plan under preparation. The Bank’s
contribution, through the Transparency
and Accountability Development Project

DeMPA follow up support

I

O n the analytic side, the World
Bank will follow up on a recent Public
Expenditure Review (PER) and provide guidance to the government on capital expenditure
execution. The Bank will undertake new analytic work to explore options to help develop a tax
system that i s more conducive to private sector development, balancing the need to raise
revenue with the necessity o f pro-business policies. A second follow o n to the PER will be a
public investment diagnostic that will identify the specific weaknesses that contribute to poor
execution o f capital spending, and suggest appropriate institutional and technical remedies that
could correct such failures. As a follow up to the Debt Management Performance Assessment
(DeMPA), the World Bank will undertake technical assistance to help the government develop
an action plan to improve debt management capacity. A final activity will undertake an analysis
o f fiscal space for decentralized local development. I t will examine a sample o f local
government budgets to determine the viability o f the planned and actual investments, identify
and analyze planned and actual expenditures and revenue, and will seek to identify policy
recommendations that could boost revenue streams, increase access loans and external grants as

18

appropriate, and identify measures to improve the efficiency o f both local government budget
planning and execution.

55.
Given the focus on mining development in the government's strategy, the Bank intends
to continue ongoing support to the government to reach the validation stage o f the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in FY 10, including placing emphasis on disclosures
related to the mining sector. In addition, an Anti-Money Laundering technical assistance
program will be provided to key government agencies, and Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR)
Initiative support will be provided as appropriate. Technical Assistance will also support the
government to develop and implement a customs integrity action plan. This will seek to
improve efficiency and transparency o f customs, and improve trade facilitation by reducing
customs clearance time at the Douala port. Support to the Cameroon Institute of
CertifiedKhartered Accountants (ONECCA) will seek to develop quality control standards for
f i r m s that perform audit and review engagements, while assistance to the Caisse Autonome
d 'Amortissement (French acronym C A A ) to make i t s internal audit department functional and
develop an electronic archiving system.
56.
Strengthening Sector Governance. World Bank support in this realm will seek to
increase understanding o f sector-specific governance impediments to development
effectiveness, and identify and agree upon corrective measures related to these deficiencies.
Past experience confirms that the best entry

and technical guidance both during

activities will therefore seek to increase
understanding o f sector-specific governance impediments to development effectiveness, and
identify and agree upon corrective measures related to these deficiencies.

57.
Political Economy Analysis in mining, protected areas, rural electrification, and
telecommunications will provide a comprehensive understanding o f the prevailing incentives,
relationships, distribution and contestation o f power between different groups and individuals
specific to each sector. World Bank involvement in each o f the sectors i s at a formative stage,
and robust political economy analysis will provide task teams with valuable insights to guide
their sector dialogue. This will build on successful work done to date in the 'education, health,
and energy sectors.
58.
The T A C D will finance Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) in the education
and health sectors. This work will provide critical information about the integrity o f budget
19

allocations down to the end users. Coupled with political economy work and dissemination to
general public and civil society, this will provide a solid entry point for the Bank to engage
policymakers and technicians alike on the implications o f these findings and to identify
corrective actions. A Budget Transparency Initiative will help to publish and disseminate
disaggregated sector budget and expenditure information, and support training and leadership
innovations related to budget disclosure at local government levels.
59.
In the fiduciary realm, the Bank will continue to undertake Forensic Audits o f selected
IDA-financed operations. This activity will provide detailed field-based evidence related to the
technical quality and fiduciary integrity o f infrastructure investments financed by the World
Bank. In Fiscal Year 2008 the Projet d’tlppui au Secteur Educatif (PASE) and PNDP
undertook this exercise (partly financed by the Country Governance and Anti-Corruption
budget), and the results have proven a valuable entry point to identify remedial measures for
problems and to engage in a broader dialogue on sector governance. A second fiduciary
innovation that i s being built into new lending operations i s random third-party technical and
financial audits for projects working at decentralized levels. Field-based evidence has proven
that this approach substantially reduces corruption in projects; it has been successfully
negotiated into two new projects in FY09, Phase I1 o f the PNDP and the Agricultural
Competitiveness Project.

60.
In order to promote change among Cameroonian stakeholders, the World Bank will
continue i t s efforts to ensure that objective analysis is in the public domain so that policymakers, service providers, and beneficiaries can better understand some o f the binding
governance constraints to development effectiveness. Beyond this, it i s also essential to bring
these stakeholders together to discuss, debate, and act on lessons derived from this public
information in the form o f Roundtable Discussions. A series o f Governance Dialogues will (i)
put results o f the sector governance activities into the public domain, and (ii)convene key
stakeholders to discuss governance and integrity issues identified by previous analytic work.
This i s expected to help improve transparency, accountability, and integrity at sector levels.

GDM w i l l be undertaken in partnership with the CHOC Program, and i s expected to be taken
over by it in subsequent years with the support o f other development partners.
62.
The Cameroon Country Office Public Information Center will be transformed into a
Civil Society Resource Center. This w i l l provide both a meeting space and materials to
improve civil society coordination, cooperation and deliberation regarding governance issues.
The Center w i l l continue to serve as a facility for global knowledge sharing. Based on the
model o f the Client Survey, a Governance Survey w i l l collect data on government
effectiveness, participation, voice and accountability, and Integrity. The survey will be
developed and deployed in close partnership with the CHOC Program. A Yaounde-based
Governance Council will act as the steering committee for the governance-related activities
during the CAS period.

ii. Strategic Theme One: Increasing Cameroon’s Competitiveness
63.
Vastly improved competitiveness underpins Cameroon’s intended growth trajectory. As
earlier referenced, despite great potential in many industries (e.g. mining, timber, agribusiness,
tourism and ICT), Cameroon’s exports continue to be
dominated by oil. The reasons for this
underperformance are essentially related to poor
infrastructure (in particular energy, transport and
telecommunications) and a poor investment climate.

and (iii)Gomotion o f high potential value chains and improved business climate. Given the
role it plays in strengthening competitiveness, regional integration i s an important part o f this
strategic theme (see Box 4).
1. Increase access to and quality of infrastructure services
64.
Energy. Bank support to the energy sector w i l l seek to improve the overall reliability
and supply on the national grid and access in rural areas o f Cameroon with a special focus on
helping the GoC to realize investments in Cameroon’s significant hydropower resources. As
outlined in Section IIc, the energy sector constitutes one o f the greatest binding constraints to
growth in Cameroon. Current World Bank engagement in the sector includes the Energy Sector
Development Project, which has yielded solid results to date, including the establishment o f a
financing mechanism for rural electrification, capacity building and preparations o f the Lom
Pangar Hydropower Project (LPHP) in accordance with World Bank and international
standards. The World Bank has two planned investments in the sector during the CAS period.
21

Financed in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the African
Development Bank (AfDB), and the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Kribi gas to power
generation project will increase the capacity and reliability o f electricity supply in Cameroon
through the provision o f 2 16 megawatts o f clean electricity. Prospective support to the LPHP
would deepen the Bank’s support to GoC to improve the availability, reliability and
affordability o f electricity supply for households and businesses, ensure that best practice
economic, environmental and social standards are adhered to in the realization o f the LPHP. A
higher share o f l o w cost hydropower resulting from the LPHP and future downstream
investments will also provide a sustainable and clean source o f energy for the country, and
would result in lower consumer prices that are critical to Cameroon’s increased
competitiveness. The World Bank will also conduct analytical work on planning regional
power investments and the impact o f climate change on Cameroon’s hydropower potential.
65.
Transport. Bank activities during the CAS period will seek to reduce dwell and transit
time o f imports coming into the Port o f Douala. As part o f the CAS strategic choice to reward
successful operations that demonstrate a financing gap, the ongoing C E M A C Transport-Transit
Facilitation Project will be scaled up during the CAS period, bringing important additional
financing to bear on the road network that connects N’Djamena and Bangui to the Douala Port.
Financed in parallel with the African Development Bank and the European Union, the
overarching objective o f the program i s to contribute to facilitate regional trade within the
C E M A C and improve access to world markets for Cameroon, the Central African Republic and
Chad. In addition to investments in the road network, the project undertakes important reform
activities in the port o f Douala and in customs.
66.
Telecommunications. In the telecommunications sector, the Bank will seek to increase
international telecommunication access and reduce associated consumer prices. The Central
Africa Backbone (CAB) will extend the geographic reach o f broadband networks and
contribute to improved government efficiency and transparency through eGovernment
applications. This will be accomplished through fostering open and cost-effective access to
communications infrastructure at the sub-regional level. This project will leverage the existing
fiber-optic network laid along the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline that will form the core C A B
network and support the deployment o f interconnected networks to form a Regional network.
This program will be undertaken in partnership with the African Development Bank.
67.
Given the critical need for improved infrastructure and the importance o f adequate
infrastructure to allow other essential and growth-inducing projects to go forward, the I F C will
focus on facilitating and supporting infrastructure projects in main sectors such as energy
(including co-financing the Kribi gas to power project) and transport (including maritime). It
will also support ancillary sectors that also serve to increase the country’s attractiveness as an
investment destination and to raise the living standards, including real estate development.

2. Improve transparency, equity, and sustainability in the use of natural resources

The second element o f World Bank support to increased competitiveness relates to the
transparent, equitable, and sustainable use o f the country’s considerable natural resource base.
In addition to a cohort o f existing investments in this area, the CAS foresees new activities
related to protected areas, mining, and fisheries. If transparently managed, and if revenues
generated are used to deliver social services and education, fund basic infrastructure, and
generate employment opportunities, the sustainable development o f the country’s natural
resources can be beneficial to the citizens o f Cameroon

68.

69.
Forestry and Protected Areas. Bank support will seek to strengthen public and private
efforts to achieve socially, economically, and ecologically sustainable use o f national forest and
wildlife resources. The ongoing Forest and Environment Policy Development Program (PSFE),
undertaken in collaboration with DFID, Canada, and Germany, supports important initiatives in
environmental monitoring, policy oversight, l a w enforcement, forest management, biodiversity
conservation, and community-based forest activities. As a follow up to this operation, a new
Protected Areas Project, based o n analytic work on support mechanisms for protected areas,
will consolidate achievements under the PSFE related to the forestry sector, and will also help
the GoC design and deploy a holistic approach to preserving and managing the country’s
protected areas. A pilot initiative to be financed under the Global Environment Facility (GEF)
will seek to establish a core protected area within the Ngoyla-Mintom forest, through an
approach based on land use planning and fostering public-private partnerships. This project will

23

be undertaken in conjunction with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature. In addition, sustainable
wood transformation activities will be covered through the planned Competitive Value Chains
Project .
70.
The World Bank has closely worked with the Congo Basin countries (Cameroon,
Gabon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Democratic Republic o f Congo and
Republic o f Congo) to develop a set o f activities, both at the regional and national level, to help
them prepare for future Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation
(REDD)-related instruments. Regional analytical work i s ongoing to better understand the
potential future trends o f deforestation in the Congo Basin and highlight impacts o f economic
development on forest cover. Cameroon i s also participant in the Readiness Mechanism o f the
Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and will get financial support to (i)prepare a national
REDD strategy, (ii)establish a reference scenario for greenhouse gas emissions from
deforestation and forest degradation, and (iii)set up a monitoring system for emissions and
emission reductions. Additionally, the World Bank i s preparing a regional project (with GEF
resources) to strengthen Congo Basin countries' capacities on REDD issues, which will build
on experiences and lessons derived from the Ngoyla-Mintom experience.

71.
Mining. In the mining sector, an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant i s helping
build capacity o f the Ministry o f Industry, Mines and Technological Development and the
Government o f Cameroon to regulate and administer the mineral sector. As more investors
express their interest in the country's mining sector and Cameroon i s o n the path to become a
mining producer, the country has sought assistance o f the World Bank to improve sector
management. The IDF grant supports a mining cadastre assessment, an artisanal and smallscale mining baseline assessment, and a mineral baseline assessment. A Mining Technical
Assistance Project will be developed during the CAS period, with the results o f the IDF grant
feeding into project design and scope. The operation would support legal, regulatory and
institutional mining sector reform. Cameroon's ability to promote i t s mining sector to
international investors and the country's ability to work with large-scale companies will be
addressed. The project may also focus on environmental and social management in mining
areas and in particular would work on issues surrounding artisanal and small-scale mining.
72.
Fisheries. Analytic work i s underway to assess the current state o f the fisheries sector in
Cameroon, take stock o f existing constraints to i t s sustainable development, and make specific
recommendations to government to address sector issues and improve governance o f fisheries.
This work will analyze the actual overall contribution o f the sector to the national economy and
to local livelihoods, and will estimate potential economic development as a result o f future
investments. Based on this analytical work as well as other interventions from the World Bank
and other donors in the region, a regional operation will be developed to (i)improve fisheries
management, (ii)develop monitoring, control and surveillance, and (iii)support economic
growth from the sector in the region.
Safeguards. World Bank support on social and environmental safeguards will foster
73.
facility-level compliance, as validated b y the Ministry o f Environmental Protection.
Accelerated development o f oil, gas and mineral resources and o f associated industries and
infrastructure i s a key element o f the government's development vision. The ongoing
Environmental and Social Capacity Building Project provides an important foundation to the

24

aforementioned infrastructure investments and for activities related to the sustainable and
transparent use o f natural resources. The project seeks to improve the management o f and the
accountability for environmental and social issues related to large infrastructure investments,
with an initial focus on the energy sector.

74.
Climate change. The World Bank team will take stock o f the on-going activities (the
Forest and Environment sector Program, the Sustainable land Management Project, and the
Forest Carbon Facility) in Cameroon and global good practice to provide further assistance to
the GoC to develop a comprehensive response to climate change. This assistance will focus o n
building institutional and technical capacity to help the GoC to become a leader in climate
change adaptation and mitigation. The World Bank will also support Cameroon's participation
in the African Program for Adaptation to Climate Change, which includes sustainable soil and
water management and agro-forestry . Other priority actions that may be supported include: (i)
helping develop a national strategy o n climate change, including building awareness and a
national consensus o n climate change's challenges and identifying at-risk sectors; (ii)
contribute to the establishment o f the National Observatory o n Climate Change through
piloting effective cross-sectoral data collection, analysis and dissemination related to climate
strengthen in-country capacity on climate change with the objective to setting up a
change; (iii)
multidisciplinary and multisectoral pool o f experts. At the sector level, the following measures
are foreseen: analytic work on the impact o f climate change on Cameroon's hydropower
potential and the promotion o f renewable energy in rural areas.

3. Develop high potential value chains and improve business climate

75.
Focusing on high potential value chains. Recognizing that past reform attempts have
been uneven and spread too broadly, the government i s centering i t s new strategy on the most
promising value chains to accelerate growth and j o b creation through private investments and
diversified high value exports. The value chain opportunities are clustered around the
manufacturing, mining, forestry, agribusiness, tourism, and I C T industries. In these industries,
Cameroon has yet to take advantage o f i t s natural and human resource riches. There i s little
industrial transformation o f raw materials, world class ecotourism sites are not accessible,
mining production remains marginal, and a relatively skilled labor force remains vastly
underemployed.
The recently approved Agricultural Competitiveness Project (Projet d'Appui & la
Compe'titivite' Agricole - PACA) focuses on high potential agricultural value chains. I t signals
the World Bank re-engagement in this sector after a decade-long absence and i s being
undertaken in parallel with the European Union and France. Given the importance o f the sector
both in reducing poverty and stimulating economic growth, the project was designed to
increase the competitiveness o f beneficiary producer organizations working on targeted value
chains. It i s expected the project will lead to increased value o f marketed production through
increased productivity, quality, and marketing o f productions. The project provides a blend o f
investment in infrastructure (the rehabilitation o f rural roads, the second for the rehabilitation o f
irrigated perimeters), and capacity building (of Producer Organizations, apex producer
organizations, and to improve core functions o f sectoral public services). Depending on IDA
availability, project performance and needs during the CAS period, additional financing could
be provided to P A C A to support export-oriented agriculture (such as coffee, cocoa, fruits and
vegetables) activities.

A Competitive Value Chains Project will seek to contribute to sustained accelerated
economic growth and employment creation by improving the competitiveness in two short t e r m

high potential value chains: sustainable wood transformation and ecotourism. I t i s expected that
the project w i l l lead to reduced costs and increased quality o f the products being offered, as
well as increased sales, exports, private investment and employment. The proposed project
aims at stimulating private investments in these high potential value chains by providing a
critical mass o f infrastructure investments, policy reforms and support to f i r m s . The IFC will
also support initiatives in the woodforestry sector and extractive industries, with a view to
increase value-adding transformation projects.

78.
Improved business climate. The Competitive Value Chain project will also focus on
improving the business environment along the two selected value chains. I t will also provide
support to the Competitiveness Committee to trigger and mobilize political support for
addressing key cross-cutting competitiveness issues and opportunities. This w i l l involve
conducting and diffusing benchmarking studies on key factor costs, establishing and publishing

promoting an enabling business environment, including the Inter-ministerial Committee

implementation o f the Investment Charter), the National Governance Program, the
Competitiveness Committee, the National Committee for the Facilitation o f Maritime Traffic,
the One-Stop-Shop for Foreign Trade.
80.
The World Bank and IFC will also work closely to increase access to financial services.
The IFC i s deploying i t s Global Trade Finance Program in Cameroon and i t s Africa Micro,
Small, and Medium Enterprise finance initiative. Through the latter, the IFC i s providing
technical assistance to help (i)develop products tailored to SMEs, (ii)strengthen i t s SME
portfolio and (iii)assist SMEs in their long-term business planning. The IFC has also
committed an equity investment in a new micro-finance institution to be established in
Cameroon, and supported the preparation o f draft legislation aimed at setting up a legal and
institutional framework to promote leasing in Cameroon. Finally, the I F C recently completed a
bond issue in the C E M A C region to develop the regional financial market and promote
harmonization between the Douala and Libreville stock exchanges. A portion o f the bonds
proceeds will allow IFC to provide local currency financing to commercial banks to increase
SME financing. The World Bank i s focusing on ensuring financial sector stability in the
C E M A C Regional Institutions Support Project. The project aims to strengthen Central African
regional institutions so that they can fulfill their mandates to encourage an expanded, better
governed regional market, and a more transparent, better regulated and more competitive
financial system. In addition, the Bank will provide assistance to GoC to help mobilize the
development potential o f remittances. In particular, it will analyze and recommend options to
reduce the cost o f money transfers. I t will also disseminate cross-country experiences in
catalyzing more effectively the financial resources o f the diaspora, particularly through the use
o f diaspora bonds.

iii. Strategic T h e m e Two: Improving Service Delivery
8 1.
Effective service delivery i s critical in reducing poverty. World Bank support to service
delivery will focus on three main areas: (i)human development where efficacy and
accountability o f the education sector will be improved and increase utilization and improve the
quality o f health services; (ii)
to help establish an effective safety net system based on targeted
programs; and (iii)local development, where the focus will be on increasing access to basic
services through infrastructure upgrading and capacity building for improved local governance
and management.
1. I m p r o v e quality and efficiency o f the education system
Education: The World Bank’s ongoing interventions in the education sector aim to
improve service delivery via more efficient use o f sector inputs (particularly teachers) that
results from better accountability systems. The recently restructured Projet d’Appui au Secteur
Educatif (Education Sector Support Project - PASE) seeks to develop and apply management
and learning tools for use by government and communities to improve the efficiency and
accountability o f the education sector in Cameroon. I t s outcomes focus on updating o f the
sector strategy based on analytic work conducted during preceding years; improving the
education information system to ensure greater accountability and better decision making;
82.

27

improving planning and monitoring capacity by education authorities, the government and the
public; and providing opportunities for greater participation o f beneficiaries in education
decision making, thus augmenting accountability. As the supervising entity for the Education
For A l l - Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Catalytic Fund, the World Bank w i l l provide
additional trust fund support during the CAS period to help finance the implementation o f the
government’s Education Sector Strategy. The grant w i l l specifically finance the remuneration
o f contract teachers, whose salaries will eventually be integrated into the national budget. New
analytic work w i l l be undertaken during the CAS period to examine the linkages between
education and economic growth. This w i l l require a holistic review that examines all the
different parts o f post-basic education (secondary, higher and Technical and Vocational
Education Training). The results o f this sector work will help orient the subsequent focus o f
further interventions in the sector, which w i l l most likely focus on one facet o f the post-basic
education.

2. Better access and quality o f health services
83.
Health. World Bank support in the health sector seeks to address binding constraints to
better service delivery through increases in utilization and improvements in the quality o f
health services, with a particular focus on child and maternal health and communicable
diseases. The ongoing Health Sector Support Project targets district level activities, providing
financial resources and a performance-based incentive system to boost outcomes. The project
focuses on gender aspects o f poverty by seeking to reduce Cameroon’s frighteningly poor
health outcomes for women. The project also puts a strong emphasis on sector staff being held
accountable for results, ensuring the flow o f funds to health facilities takes place in a timely
manner, where results are measured and remunerated. The project i s also expected to help
strengthen the health information system and generate new credible data. The availability o f
better information will provide the opportunity to more thoroughly analyze the health sector
and engage in better-informed policy dialogue. Undertaken in parallel with sector support from
Germany and France, the project i s expected to last the duration o f the CAS period. A health
28

country status report w i l l be prepared in F Y 11, and w i l l help guide future interventions in the
sector.

3. Greater access to basic infrastructure and social safety nets
As earlier outlined, deepened decentralization lies at the heart o f the government’s
recent policy prescriptions, including the announcement o f intergovernmental fiscal transfers to
84.

local governments in 2010. This shift presents both an opportunity and a tremendous challenge
to these local governments, who lack the requisite skills and experience to select and supervise
efficient high-quality investments. Along similar lines, measures taken to date by the
government to respond to the impact o f exogenous shocks on the population have not been well
targeted to those most affected. As poverty rates stagnate and the overall number o f poor
increases, particularly in the north o f the country, there i s a real need to identify safety net
activities that could rectify this worrying trend.

85.
Local Development and Basic Infrastructure. The National Community Development
Program, an APL whose second phase was recently approved by the World Bank Board o f
Directors, i s one o f the institution’s two key entry points to improve local development
activities. Financed in partnership with Germany and France, the program seeks to improve the
delivery o f specified basic social services (health, education, water and sanitation) in targeted
local governments, and extend the ongoing process in support to decentralization to new
regions. This program’s third and final phase w i l l be financed late in the CAS period.

86.

The second entry point i s the ongoing Urban and Water Development Project (PDUE),
which also supports local development, albeit in urban areas. The project i s working to increase
access o f the urban population, particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic

infrastructure and services, including water. I t works intensively with five municipalities
(Bamenda, Douala, Maroua, Mbalmayo, and Yaounde) in order to build their administrations’
capacity to plan, implement, and maintain small infrastructure works (primarily roads and
drainage), as well as construction or repair o f social facilities (such as classrooms or health
centers) in a transparent and sustainable manner. Crisis Response Window resources will be
used in F Y 20 10 to provide additional financing for critical urban infrastructure investments.

87.
A proposed Urban Sanitation Project will seek to increase and improve access to
sanitation, primarily in low-income neighborhoods o f the main cities o f Cameroon. The project
w i l l include capacity building and institutional strengthening, infrastructure work, and
vocational training, hygiene education, and sanitation promotion. The potential partners in the
project include the African Development Bank, France, the European Union, and Korea.
Analytic support i s currently being provided to the municipality o f Douala to prepare a City
Development Strategy (CDS), which w i l l provide an important foundation for municipal
investments in basic services and infrastructure. During the CAS period, support will be
provided to the municipality o f Yaounde to also develop a CDS.
88.
Safety Nets. An extensive review o f existing safety net programs w i l l be undertaken in
early in the CAS period. It w i l l provide a platform for policy dialogue with the government
regarding the possibility o f using targeted transfer programs to the most poor and vulnerable to
reduce poverty and protect them from the potential effects o f the global financial crisis. This
review w i l l also examine gender-sensitive options for these targeted activities, in light o f the
29

important role women play in ensuring welfare at household level. This analytic work will also
investigate the current functioning o f the social security system in general and o f the safety nets
system in Cameroon in particular. I t i s expected that the government will improve the
effectiveness and monitoring o f the safety net system by adjusting existing programs and
piloting new programs. In support o f this, a new project late in the CAS period would provide
the necessary support and resources to the government to achieve this goal. The main objective
o f the project would be to strengthen the social safety nets system and to set up permanent
programs that can provide income support to chronic and transitory poor to be used in regular
times and to respond to crises, such as direct transfer or a public works program, following the
recommendations o f the analytic work.

V. Program delivery, monitoring, and management
89.
Program Delivery. Though Cameroon i s classified as a lower middle-income country, it
will remain IDA eligible for the CAS period. Cameroon’s 2008 GNI per capita was US$1150,
just above the operational IDA cut-off point o f US$1135. If Cameroon exceeds the cut-off
point in 2009, it would become a gap country in F Y 2012 and receive IDA assistance on
hardened terms (20 years maturity and 10 years grace). Though Cameroon’s economic outlook
i s expected to remain favorable in the coming three years, the country i s unlikely to be eligible
for IBRD lending so long as: (i)it i s under an IMF program that precludes any recourse to nonconcessional lending13, and (ii)it has not established a sustained and credible track record o f
economic performance. Upon achieving these milestones, a formal assessment o f Cameroon’s
creditworthiness for IBRD lending w i l l be carried out.I4 Such assessment i s based on an
analysis o f eight creditworthiness components (political risk, external debt and liquidity, fiscal
policy and public debt burden, balance o f payment risks, economic structure and growth
prospects, monetary and exchange rate policy, financial sector risks, and corporate sector debt
and vulnerabilities).
90.
Total I D A resource availability to Cameroon during the CAS period from FY2010 to
FY2013 i s estimated at approximately US$430 million. Cameroon’s FY2010 allocation i s
US$130 million (including US$29.7 million in additional resources made available through a
pilot I D A Crisis Response Window), and i t s FY2011 to 2013 allocation in i s estimated at about
US$lOO million per year. The FY11-13 allocations are indicative only and can change
depending on: (i)total available IDA resources; (ii)the country’s performance rating; (iii)
the
performance and assistance terms o f other I D A borrowers; (iv) the terms o f IDA’Sassistance to
Cameroon (grants or credits); and (v) the number o f IDA-eligible countries. FY12 and FY13
indicative allocations assume a similar level o f replenishment in IDA16 as in IDA15. Should
additional I D A resources materialize during the CAS period, this would be used to scale-up the
amounts allocated to the pipeline o f planned investments rather than necessitating the
development o f new ones.
91.

Program Monitoring. The CAS includes a strong focus on managing for development
results. CAS outcomes are based on a holistic view o f development, incorporating the concept
o f strong interdependencies between different interventions and outcomes, and acknowledging
13

Cameroon completed its Fourth PRGF in April 2009, and will consider a new IMF program in the coming
months.
I 4 IBRD borrower’s creditworthiness i s defined as the country’s ability and willingness to repay IBRD on time and
in full. Middle-incomecountries qualify for borrowing from IBRD based on this creditworthiness.

30

cross-sectoral synergies that influence CAS contributions. Drawing upon the experience o f the
last CAS, the results framework (see Annex 2) has been carefully structured to incorporate the
most relevant and effective indicators for monitoring progress from both ongoing and planned
activities during the CAS period. Given that all indicators are taken from those that are
currently tracked in Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) o f projects in the
portfolio, CAS results monitoring w i l l be strengthened with the increased attention that i s being
placed on ISR quality. In addition, these indicators w i l l be tracked in real time, using the CAS
monitoring tool that was recently developed by the Operations Policy and Country services
Department. The CAS results framework w i l l also be adjusted as and when projects are
formally restructured to reflect any formal changes in those project indictors that are also
included in the CAS results framework. Changes to the CAS results framework will be
compiled into the CAS Progress Report and the CAS Completion Report.

92.
Program management. The quarterly CAS progress reports will also be shared with the
government, and w i l l be discussed in depth during Country Portfolio Performance Reviews
(CPPRs). Country management w i l l continue i t s recent practice o f sending monthly monitoring
tables to the Country Team and the government, in order to identify both areas o f progress and
prospective risk. To promote transparency in results and results monitoring, it i s intended that
intermediary and final results from Bank financed interventions will be made available to the
public by publishing these monthly portfolio snapshots on the Cameroon country office
website. The World Bank w i l l also continue decentralizing senior international staff to the
country office in order to ensure a more sustained sector dialogue and stronger attention to
development outcomes. CPPRs w i l l continue to be held on a bi-annual basis, and w i l l not only
identify and address cross-cutting challenges to the portfolio, but also bring in outside experts
to critically examine specific projects that are either already at risk, or that have demonstrated
recent diminished performance, as demonstrated by a lowered rating o f either Implementation
Progress or progress toward achieving the Project Development Objective. Based on these
analyses at both levels, the Country Management Unit w i l l continue to facilitate training
seminars with project units that specifically respond to identified weaknesses, as has been the
case in the past with annual work programming, procurement, and disbursement request
processing.
VI. Aid coordination, Partnership and Consultation
93.
CAS preparation involved sustained and substantive discussions with Cameroonian
government officials, civil society, private sector actors, and legislators that led to a consensual
vision for Bank activities over the CAS period. Other
donors were consulted from the outset, and the strategy

identify synergies during the strategy period for investments, analytic work, and policy
dialogue with the government. Though each strategy is a distinct document, they reflect these
efforts to harmonize our dialogue and planned interventions during the CAS period.
94.
CAS consultations themselves consisted o f several meetings and workshops over
several months. The most intensive period was during a week in May 2009, when eight
brainstorming sessions were held based on major prospective themes for the CAS. These
involved over 250 participants, and included representatives o f the government administration,
civil society, National Assembly, and academia. In early June 2009, consultations were jointly
conducted with the IFC in Douala to seek input from the private sector. The Client Survey was
fielded in March 2009, and included responses from a total o f 258 stakeholders, drawn from
different organizations and sectors. The questionnaire identified overall attitudes toward the
Bank, the importance o f specific areas o f the Bank’s work and the Bank’s effectiveness in those
areas, and their level o f agreement with a series o f statements about the way the World Bank
does business. Respondents were also asked about general issues facing Cameroon, the Bank’s
future role in the country, and the Bank’s communication and outreach efforts in Cameroon.
95.

With the broader donor community, the Bank worked in close collaboration with the
Comite‘ Multi-Bailleurs (CMB), a Yaounde-based group that consists o f heads o f development
cooperation for major multi- and bi-lateral donors during strategy preparation. The group
anchors i t s work program around the Paris Declaration and sector working groups. As such the
C M B served a critical forum to ensure coordination and harmonized approaches both for
strategy preparation and the activities identified herein. Annex 3 provides an overview o f donor
complementarities at sector levels. The C M B will continue to serve as the anchor for
development partner cooperation during CAS implementation.

96.
The International Finance Corporation was critical to the preparation o f the strategy. In
addition to spearheading consultations with the private sector in Douala and participating in
review and Country Team meetings, the IFC worked closely with World Bank colleagues to
use the strategy preparation process as an opportunity to identify synergies at the sector level,
as outlined in the “Bank Group Response” Section o f the CAS itself.

VII.
Managing Risks
The fragile global economy, coupled with a challenging country context, present several
97.
risks to the strategy, notably the following:

-

-

Exogenous risks. In light o f the global economic climate, GDP growth estimates for
2009 stood at only 2.4 percent, well below DSCE and Vision 2035 estimates for the
medium_term.If the current crisis persists or worsens, direct and spillover effects on the
Cameroonian economy may become pronounced. For this reason, the World Bank i s
immediately supporting analytic work that will examine social safety net options to
mitigate these adverse shocks, and has allocated resources for new lending related to a
safety net program.
Macroeconomic risks. Cameroon’s medium-term growth forecasts in the DSCE and the
Vision 2035 appear to underestimate the financing requirements to achieve the
economic growth rates needed for a substantial decline in poverty. Should the ambitious

32

projection for private investment not materialize, public investment may need to
compensate for the shortfall. This situation could lead to an accumulation o f new
payment arrears and excessive borrowing. To mitigate these risks and safeguard fiscal
sustainability, continued progress in strengthening P F M and debt management would be
called for. The Bank will assist the Government in this regard through the T A C D
project and further AAA work on identifying the hurdles o f public investment
execution.

-

Development Effectiveness Risks. Cameroon has a poor track record o f implementing
reforms that have a direct impact on poverty reduction. While the government i s often
firm in i t s commitment to these reforms (for example related to governance and anticorruption), few o f these are pursued to their fullest extent. There i s a real risk that this
pattern o f behavior will be repeated in the next CAS, translating into compromised
development effectiveness and sustained inertia related to inclusive growth. Mitigating
this risk calls for developing projects where there i s strong political will, and continuing
to strengthen the Bank Group’s policy dialogue at all levels o f government, including
with the Executive.

-

Reputational Risks. Certain investments, most notably the Lom Pangar Hydropower
Project, pose significant reputational risks to the World Bank. Taking lessons learned
from projects such as the Chad Cameroon pipeline on board, the World Bank has
already started to build GoC’s capacity to prepare the LPHP according to best practice
standards, and already has in place a parallel environmental and social capacity building
project and forestry and environment protection program. Reputational risks are also
present with respect to the governance agenda, where a failure o f the World Bank to
deliver these activities would lead to an unacceptable perpetuation o f the status quo.
Adequate human and financial resources will therefore need to be deployed for these
efforts.

-

-

Fiduciary Risks. From a fiduciary perspective, Cameroon i s a high-risk environment, as
the CAS clearly demonstrates. To mitigate this, the Bank will continue and deepen i t s
aggressive, practical interventions to ensure fiduciary integrity o f IDA operations; will
help strengthen the government’s fiduciary risk management; will design operations
that reduce opportunities for corruption; and will seek to change the incentives facing
government counterparts by emphasizing the importance o f results and the Bank’s zero
tolerance for corruption.
Political Economy Risks. At the political level, Cameroon i s considered as a stable
country. However, the lead up to the 201 1 presidential election could result in pressure
for World Bank-financed activities to be used to political ends. While there i s limited
scope to mitigate such a political risk, Bank task teams will carefully monitor planned
investments to ensure that these are being targeted based on developmental, and not
political, merits or interests. The Bank will closely monitor the situation and use the
CAS midterm review to adjust the assistance strategy as necessary.

Annex 12: Country Financing Parameters
Date: April 14, 2005
The country financing parameters for Cameroon set out below have been approved by the
Regional Vice President. Africa Region. and are being Dosted on the Bank’s internal website.
Parameter Remark / Explanation
Item

Cost sharing : Limit on the 100%
proportion
of
individual
project costs that the Bank
may finance

Recurrent cost financing. N o
Any limits that would apply to countrythe
overall
amount
o f level limit
recurrent expenditure that the
Bank may finance

Local cost financing. Are the Yes
requirements
for
Bank
financing
of
local
expenditures met, namely that:
(i)financing requirement for
country’s
development
program would exceed the
public sector’s own resources
(e.g., from taxation and other
revenues)
and
expected
domestic borrowing; and (ii)
the financing o f foreign
expenditures alone would not
enable the Bank to assist in the
financing
of
individual
projects.
Taxes and duties. Are there NONE
any taxes and duties that the
Bank would not finance?

Counterpart
funding
will
be
generally
encouraged. 100% Bank financing might be
expected in some projectdsectors where urgent
actions are required such as HIVIAIDS,
electricity and environment. In sector programs
(e.g., health, education, transport, and forestry
sectors) some financing from Government would
be generally expected. In projects providing
support to local communities, financing may be
sought from uroiect beneficiaries in kind or cash.
The Bank would continue to monitor the overall
fiscal and debt situation, and i t s implications for
recurrent financing. Bank financing o f recurrent
costs w i l l be applied with caution. In particular,
the Bank w i l l consider, on a project-by-project
basis, financing recurrent costs taking into
account (i) the sustainability o f project
achievements, (ii)
future budgetary outlays.
The two requirements are met. The Bank may
finance local costs in the proportions needed in
individual projects.

As o f February 2005, there are no taxes and duties
that have been identified to be unreasonable or
discriminatory. In individual projects, the Bank
would examine whether taxes and duties
constitute an excessively high share o f project
cost.

I.Introduction
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the
effectiveness o f the FY04-06 World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Cameroon (Report No. 26555, dated August 2003) and the subsequent Interim Strategy Report
(ISN), (Report No. 37897-CM, dated November 9,2006). It i s based upon reviews o f (a)
portfolio implementation performance reports; (b) most recent Implementation Status and
Results Reports (ISRs) and Aide-Memoires o f each project active during the respective periods,
(c) Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) o f projects completed during the period,
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Reviews o f ICRs, and Quality Assurance Group (QAG)
Reviews, where available; (d) interviews with selected client counterparts; and (e) selfassessments by the Country Team. The findings from this assessment have informed the
preparation o f the FY 10-FY 13 Country Assistance Strategy.
2.
During the course o f FY04-06 CAS period, significant changes occurred in Cameroon's
development context. These changes included Cameroon's attainment o f the completion point
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in April 200617. In addition,
Cameroon also became eligible to receive additional assistance from the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI) and from official bilateral creditors belonging to the Paris Club Group.
Both marked a significant shift in the relationship between the Government and i t s international
partners and provided Cameroon with an opportunity to accelerate development, to get back on
track to reach i t s Millennium Development Goals and to tackle the high prevalence o f
corruption. All o f these changes resulted in the Government's decision to start to revise i t s
PRSP, with an original expected completion date o f early 2008.

3.
Against this backdrop, and in order to ensure that the Bank's next CAS would be fully
aligned, an ISN was prepared to extend the CAS for FY07-08, and which reflected consultation
with the Government, other stakeholders and international partners. At the end o f the CAS
period, initial high level conclusions regarding the effectiveness o f Bank contributions were
presented in the I S N (and have been incorporated within this document). It was agreed that a
comprehensive evaluation o f progress in achieving CAS outcomes would be conducted at the

I7 At the decision point, Cameroon was expected to reach completion point in April 2003, but it was only until 2005
after the macroeconomic framework were strengthened and progress in PRSP implementation and governance
measures were sustained that Cameroon was able to reach the completion point in April 2006, after fidfilling all
agreed conditions.

Completion Report.

11. Government's Strategic Goals
4.
Finalized in 2003, the strategic framework o f the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) rested upon seven pillars: (i)
promoting a stable macroeconomic framework; (ii)
strengthening growth through economic diversification; (iii)
empowering the private sector as
the main engine o f growth and as a partner in social service delivery; (iv) developing basic
infrastructure and natural resources in an environmentally sustainable manner; (v) accelerating
regional integration within the Economic and Monetary Community o f Central Africa
framework (CEMAC, Communaute Economique et MonCtaire d'Afrique Central); (vi)
strengthening human resources, bolstering the social sectors, and promoting the integration o f
vulnerable groups in the economy; and (vii) improving the institutional framework,
administrative management, and governance.
5.
Following a slow start, the 2005 progress report o f the PRSP highlighted progress in
several areas, including diversification o f the economy and the growth in non-oil revenues, the
preparation o f Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) based on sector strategies in
priority sectors, and better alignment o f annual budget allocations with PRSP priorities. Despite
this improvement, economic growth during the period o f CAS implementation fell short o f
expectations and PRSP target growth rates.
6.
Cameroon continues to lag with respect to achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), which underscores the difficulty in gearing public policy toward a focused effort at
ensuring that the poorest benefit from the country's modest growth. Only two MDGs'' are
within reach by 2015, but only if reforms are sustained. Indicators relating to gender equality
and women's empowerment, maternal mortality, child health and reduction o f malaria and other
major disease incidence w i l l not be met. Finally, the goal that seeks to halve the population
living below the poverty line i s also unlikely to be met.
7.
Completion o f the second PRSP was delayed considerably for various reasons, including
the decision by the Government to undertake a longer t e r m strategic analysis and vision
stretching to 2035. At the time o f writing, many o f the outstanding actions have now been
completed and the PRSP has just been finalized.

111.
B a n k Strategic Objectives and CAS Outcomes
8.
The FY04-06 CAS was one o f the first results CASs to be developed in the Bank. I t was
well aligned to the agenda detailed in the country's PRSP and presented to the Board in July
2003. I t was aimed at supporting the goal o f reducing poverty by improving basic service
delivery and spurring private sector-led growth, underpinnedby better governance.
These two pillars o f the CAS remained valid in the I S N for FY07-08. There was,
9.
however, a need for adjustments, to reflect the country's changing development context, the
World Bank's Africa Action Plan (AAP), lessons learnt arising from consultations with the
Government and other partners, including a client survey and other analysis e.g., a QAG

These are (i) ensuring primary education, and (ii)increasing the proportion o f population with access to drinking
water (environmental sustainability)

57

assessment o f ESW. A l l o f this was embodied in three guiding principles for World Bank Group
support, namely: (i)to step up efforts to address governance, notably by reducing corruption;
(ii)
to strengthen partnership, alignment, and harmonization; and (iii)
to strengthen management
for results, based on a modified I S N results framework organized around six outcome clusters.
To further foster the Bank Group's management for results, the Bank's country office was also
strengthened, including through the decentralization o f some international staff.

The results assessment o f the CAS FY04-06/ISN FY07-08 i s presented according to the
structure o f the I S N results matrix. As described above, this was reorganized around six
outcome clusters, designed to create stronger cross-sector linkages, greater operational cohesion
across the Bank Group, as well as to improve the effectiveness o f activities with other partners.
Due to the brevity o f the two year period, a decision was taken by the newly appointed Country
Director not to appoint outcome cluster leaders, nor to implement the Development
Effectiveness Scorecard. Instead, results o f the program were assessed regularly, particularly
during Country Portfolio Program Reviews (CPPRs).

Based upon the two pillars o f strengthening the institutional framework for pro-poor
economic management and service delivery, as well as reducing selected constraints to, and
directly supporting private sector development, the six outcome clusters consisted o f the

13.
Moderate progress was made by the Bank during the I S N period towards supporting this
outcome. Nevertheless, the Bank provided some critical ground work towards the end o f the
CAS period which positively influenced the PRSP process, particularly in relation to the
establishment o f a PRSP-centered dialogue platform between the Government and i t s
stakeholders.
Significant activities during the CAS period included a Poverty Assessment (FY05) and a
14.
Development Policy Review (both the original report that was delivered in FY04 and a later
update) both designed to support the revision and implementation o f the PRSP. In a review
undertaken by QAG, the Development Policy Review, delivered in 2004, was judged to be an
"outstanding report" and rated highly satisfactory. With regards to the likely impact, the report
was considered to provide an important contribution towards the first PRSC, the IMF PRGF, the
PRSP, other IDA-financed operations in forestry, capacity building and other sectors and also
the new CAS. The Poverty Assessment, delivered in 2005, was also rated as highly satisfactory
by QAG, particularly in terms o f i t s likely impact. Joint efforts between the Government and the
Bank team were considered to be best practice. The Assessment was expected to provide an
important contribution towards updating the PRSP as well as guiding public expenditure
decisions through the MTEF.
15.
Bank support provided to the Government towards attainment o f the HIPC Completion
Point also provided critical ground work in revising the PRSP. For example, the Debt Relief
Grant Under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, completed in December 2006, was a highly
innovative operation and only the second o f i t s type to be carried out (i.e. debt relief on IBRD
debt). The operation was rated satisfactory with considerable impact. Albeit the HIPC
completion point was achieved three years later than planned, the country's debt sustainability
improved as a result o f the grant and CPIA ratings for Quality o f Budgeting and Financial
Management improved since 2001. Other benefits related to improvements in HIPC tracking
indicators (e.g., improved budget classification).
16.
The revision o f the PRSP by the Government was influenced by consultations which
highlighted increased public demand for more government ownership, transparency and
responsiveness. Participatory consultations (across all ten departments o f the country) as well as
outreach to civil society representatives were launched by the Ministry o f Economy, Planning
and Territorial Administration (MINEPAT) in March 2008 to take stock o f results from PRS I
implementation and to incorporate stakeholder recommendations for geographical and sector
targeting. It i s estimated that some 6,000 people were consulted, representing a labor-intensive
undertaking for the authorities.

59

17.
The consultations also confirmed the major shortcoming o f PRS Iimplementation
including the dearth o f quantifiable indicators and measurable outcomes. This was largely due
to (i)
the absence o f baseline information on performance levels and service standards at PRS I
launch in 2003; (ii)
the absence o f M&E tools to track the public investment budget and service
delivery during PRS implementation; (iii)
l o w statistical capacity at central ministry and local
administration levels, as well as constraints on the ability o f the Institut National de la
Statistique (INS) to respond to growing demand for information; (iv) the tendency to view
participatory consultation as a once-in-four-year event rather than as a regular exercise and (v)
weak capacity o f government and the mass media to conduct outreach on development issues.
While stressing the country-driven nature o f PRSII, M I N E P T expressed initial interest in
18.
Bank support to strategy implementation and monitoring in three principal areas (i)
to
strengthen public expenditure management (circuit des depenses), financial management and
procurement mechanisms between central and local administrations; (ii)
to provide support for
institutionalizing participatory monitoring and feedback mechanisms in 2-3 priority sectors
highlighted in PRS 11; and (iii)to support statistical capacity development in core and line
ministries. During the I S N period, a trust fund o f up to US$500,000 was made available by the
Bank in this regard, including capacity-building but to date, the Government has preferred to
proceed without support in order to reflect strengthened government ownership o f the process.

For the Government o f Cameroon, attainment o f the HIPC Completion Point represented
a "starting point" for renewed effort to fight corruption and strengthen transparency and
accountability in the management o f public resources. Strengthening o f public financial
management was a critical element o f the 2006-20 10 National Governance Program,
particularly given the significant increase in resources as a result o f debt relief.
20.
During the CAS/ISN period, modest progress was made by the Bank in achieving i t s
respective outcomes, namely to ensure that the Government exhibits greater transparency and
accountability in mobilization and use o f public resources and that Management and resource
flows in key line ministries improved. At the end o f the CAS period, it was noted that 8 o f 16
indicators o f the quality o f public expenditure management were met, a slight improvement
over the CAS baseline o f 7 o f 15.19 In two ministries (health and public works) substantial
progress was made in preparing sector strategies and MTEFs as the basis for the annual budget.
A more detailed summary o f progress made during the CAS period, in particular in four areas o f
public management i s provided below as well as outstanding key challenges for the I S N period

19

Since the publication o f the FY04-06 CAS, an indicator on procurement was added, bringing the number of
indicators to 16. Cameroon had satisfactory ratings in only 4 of 15 areas in the 2001 baseline.

period

Progress made during the CAS FY04-06
weriod
Budget allocations to PRSP priorities,
particularly education, health and
infrastructure, have progressively
increased.
A global MTEF, as well as sector MTEFs
and strategies in education, health, rural
development, public works, justice, and
social development, have been developed
and are contributing to the preparation o f
the 2007 budget.
The budget has become more
comprehensive, with the road fund and
spending previously financed directly
through the national oil company now
included in the budget.
A new, common nomenclature for
budgeting and accounting has been
adopted.

Key challenges during ISN FYO7-08 period

Full adoption o f the MTEF approach,
emphasizing decentralized budget
planning and costing, results orientation
and monitoring, and better coordination.
Creation o f fiscal space to raise public
investment expenditures from less than 2
percent in recent years to 4-5 percent in
the medium term, as envisaged in the
PRSP.
Adoption and implementation o f the new
organic budget law currently under
preparation w i l l facilitate implementation
o f the MTEF approach.
Strengthening partnerships between the
Government and international partners in
order to ensure alignment o f external
resources to the PRSP through the MTEFs
and the budget.

(b) Budget execution and control
Progress made during the CAS FY04-06
period
Improvements in budget execution and
control include computerization o f
budget transactions and treasury
systems, closure o f most government
accounts held at commercial banks,
significant reduction in the use o f
special procedures that bypass the
expenditure chain, regular payment by
the Government o f public utility bills,
monitoring o f the finances o f public
enterprises, and payment o f domestic
debt and arrears based on a multiyear
payment plan.

Key challenges during ISN FYO7-08period

Internal budget control systems remain
weak. Key improvements required include
making line ministries responsible and
accountable for managing expenditures,
clarifying the mandates o f the various
control units, and addressing problems in
the transition to computerized systems.
Management and control o f personnel and
payroll needs to be substantially
strengthened, by completing the census to
cleanse the payroll, ensuring that
employment o f contract workers i s
brought within the control o f the
budgetary process, and introducing secure
systems for personnel information and
payroll

I.
Progress during the I S N FYO7-OS period
21,
Most o f the key challenges identified during the ISN period are still relevant today; two
o f the milestones were not met and two were met partially. With regards to strengthening and
increasing transparency in public financial management, including procurement, relevant bank
support was incorporated within the IDA-financed Transparency and Accountability Capacity
Development project (TACD). A project component emphasized the need for more
transparency o f public accounts and sharpening the focus on accountability and oversight by the
National Assembly and the civil society. It was also designed to complement the work led by
the European Union, via the joint public financial management platform, to strengthen the
newly established Chamber o f Accounts. Following extensive preparation delay (5 years), the
TACD project became effective in June 2009, after completion o f the I S N period. Work i s
currently underway to focus on beneficiary and stakeholder commitment and to ensure proper
implementation and results are achieved.
22.
The delay in the project preparation hampered the Bank's ability to contribute fully
towards the achievement o f the milestones as articulated in the results matrix o f the ISN. For
example, the central government financial statements o f 2004 and 2005 have just been prepared,
later than the proposed 2006 and 2007 deadlines and the Chamber o f Accounts i s yet to audit
the 2005 statements. Procurement audits have been also conducted on annual basis, but results
are not published. The milestone relating to the integration o f the MTEF in the preparation o f
the 2008 budget was not met; this was prepared using existing budget procedures that do not
allow for a meaningful integration o f PRSP priorities and without a multiyear perspective. Still,
the National Assembly adopted in December 2006, a new budget and financial framework that
w i l l allow for multiyear budgeting and sets the implementing calendar for the 2013 budget.
23.
Significant AAA support was provided by the Bank during the CAS/ISN period. This
included continuation o f the policy dialogue and technical assistance, outreach and
dissemination o f key pieces o f analytical work completed in FY06, and analysis o f emerging
issues, including the anticormption agenda. The CPAR follow-up, delivered as additional A A A
in FY06, was rated as satisfactory in terms o f meeting i t s likely impact by QAG. As mentioned
above, the Development Policy Review o f 2004, rated by QAG review as highly satisfactory,
also had a significant impact in terms o f the public finance reform agenda and resulted in
stronger linkages between sector programs and the MTEF. The FY07-08 work program focused
on sector dialogue and knowledge generation on governance. Examples o f activities included
coordinated anti -corruption support with other development partners, dissemination o f the
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (as part o f the multidonor public financial management platform) and support to the implementation o f the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). To date, partial progress has been made by
the Bank under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), with particular focus on
increased transparency in oil revenues; EITI conciliator reports o f 200 1-2004 and o f 2005 were
disseminated respectively in 2006 and 2007. The E I T I reports o f 2006 and 2007 are currently
under preparation.

24. As noted in the I S N (p 20), CAS interventions in FY04-06 to relax constraints and reduce
the costs to the private sector showed little progress. In the ISN, the Bank planned to step up its
support in five areas as well as to address in-country staffing constraints. The five priority areas
included (i)helping improve the business environment, including through support to set up a
public-private dialogue mechanism for mechanism for addressing priority reforms in line with
the results o f the Investment Climate Assessment, the ROSC, and Doing Business surveys, (ii)
supporting public enterprise reforms, building on global expertise, including private-public
partnerships, (iii)
supporting small and medium-size enterprises, notably by continuing IFC
support to the business advisory services provided by the private sector umbrella organization
GICAM (Groupement Inter-patronal du Cameroun, Cameroon Employers Group); promoting
leasing, through regulatory change; supporting micro finance; and linking small and mediumsize enterprise supply chains to large investments, such as AES Sonel, (iv) financing IFC direct
investments and advisory services in infrastructure, financial markets, forestry, and general
manufacturing and services and (v) supporting reforms and initiatives that improve access to
financial services, primarily by providing assistance to regional markets and institutions in the
financial sector.
25. In spite o f these efforts, during the I S N period, little progress was made in achieving the
outcomes and milestones in this cluster. Cameroon continues to make very slow progress with
respect to i t s indicators relating to starting a new business. The second I S N milestone, namely
to increase Cameroon's ranking in the 2008 Doing Business survey was not met; Cameroon's
ranking in the 2008 survey improved by one position compared to the 2007 survey (from 161 to
160). During this time, Cameroon managed to reduce both the time and cost to start a business
from 44 in 2005 to 37 days in 2007, and also from 157.4 percent o f GNI per capital to 129.2
percent respectively but no changes have been recorded in terms o f reducing the number o f
procedures, including obtaining licenses to start a business.
26.

Efforts to develop an effective public-private sector dialogue structure and to convene a
first business investment forum by June 2007 were supported by the joint Bank's Publidprivate
Partnership for Growth and Poverty Reduction Project (PPPGRP). While some progress was
made, the project was deemed to be unsatisfactory by IEG with a weak project design and
inadequate monitoring and evaluation procedures to permit a meaningful assessment o f
progress. Good achievements were noted in financial sector work on micro finance and in
improving the efficacy o f Doula Port, but the reform o f postal savings and social security was
also limited by a lack o f government commitment. The project supported the establishment and
early years o f operation o f the Competitiveness Committee. The Committee gained some
importance with the Government's increased interest in supporting high potential value chains
and in introducing investment climate reforms along these value chains. The Committee acts as
a think tank to the Government on competitiveness issues.
27. CAS outcomes relating to reducing delays in payment clearing and process in Bank to
Bank and to Client to client transactions were met. This was largely as a result o f support
provided by the Bank's regional project, BEAC regional payment system, (Banque des etats de
1'Afrique Centrale), which was aimed at improving the efficiency and security o f the payment
system in the Central African Economic and Monetary Union. The ICR report i s s t i l l under
preparation, but the last ISR reports that all project development objectives have been either met

66

or exceeded: significant reduction o f delays were recorded in payment clearing and settlement
and settlement o f large value transactions in real time.

28. After considerable delay, the CEMAC Regional Institutions Support Project was
approved by the Board in December 2008, and became effective six months later in April 2009.
The project aims to strengthen Central African regional institutions so that they can fulfill their
mandates to encourage an expanded, better governed regional market, and a more transparent,
better regulated and more competitive financial system. The project i s currently experiencing
delays in implementation and effectiveness.
29. With respect to lessons learnt, the IEG review o f the PPPGRP indicated the importance
o f effective supervision and monitoring and evaluation systems. Close attention needs to be paid
to political economy and the Bank should withdraw if considerable opposition and delay are
encountered.
IFC financing and advisory support
11.
30. IFC’s strategy for Cameroon included: i)support to the infrastructure sector, in particular
the power generation segment; (ii)enhanced financial and technical support to the SME sector,
through local financial intermediaries; (iii)improvement o f the country’s investment climate
and reduction in the cost o f doing business; and (iv) identification o f areas suitable for joint
IDA/IFC initiatives to maximize WBG impact using sector studies and mapping. IFC delivered
significant new investments during the CAS implementation period. The flagship investment
was a US$90 million-equivalent investment in AES Sonel, the privatized power utility, IFC’s
single largest investment in Sub Saharan Africa in FY06. Other operations included mainly
small-scale investments in logistics, the financial sector, and general manufacturing. IFC also
stepped up efforts to support small and medium-size enterprises. In close collaboration with
Cameroon’s largest private sector umbrella organization, GICAM, IFC provided training, access
to information, and capacity-building.

3 1. IFC has also been actively involved in the implementation o f a platform for private public
dialog to enhance the business environment in Cameroon through the Cameroon Business
Forum (CBF) following the signature o f the M O U between the Government, the Private Sector
and IFC in January 2009. The letter o f request for Doing Business technical assistance has been
signed by the Minister o f Economy on October 2008 and the Doing Business Memo has been
formally submitted to the Prime Minister during VP Michael Klein’s visit in February 2009.
IFC i s currently leading the advisory work required for the Growth Oriented Women
Entrepreneurs Program (GOWE program) which i s a guarantee program set up by the African
Development Bank (ADB) to fast-track the growth o f woman owned and operated small and
medium-sized enterprises in Cameroon.

Transport
32. Good progress was made towards achieving the CAS outcomes and I S N milestones in the
transport sector during the respective period. These achievements built upon the reforms
implemented under the Bank's Third Structural Adjustment Credit I11 (SAC 111), which closed in
March 2004, and the Transport Sector Project (which closed in December 2003, before the start
o f the CAS period). One o f the four major development goals o f SAC I11 related to substantially
lower transport costs and to increase the availability o f services, both internationally and
domestically. This credit was judged to be satisfactory by 1EG.
33. With reference to CAS outcomes, examples o f achievement o f relevant objectives
included a reduction in costs and improvement o f services (except in air transport), institutional
and regulatory reform, privatization o f several port activities, rehabilitation o f infrastructure,
and dredging which made the port o f Doula more competitive and efficient. For example, the
average stay at quay was reduced from 3.8 days to 1 day, clearance delays were reduced, and
the cost o f import container handling was reduced by 27 percent. More than 20,000 o f roads
received maintenance funding and resources for maintenance increased dramatically (from 20
billion CFA/US$400m to 40 billion CFA/US$800m (during the CAS/ISN period), following
respect by the government o f i t s memorandum o f understanding with the EC and other donors.
Rail traffic increased substantially following the privatization (concession) o f the railway, and
funds flows between the government and the rail sector were steadily positive in favor o f the
government during the whole CAS Period. However, the privatization strategy for CAMAIR
(the domestic airline) was not implemented and the company remained subject to government
interference.

34. During most o f the CAS and ISN period the Bank did not have a project to support the
achievement o f targets related to the road sector (the CEMAC TTF project was declared
effective only in July 2008, which was very close to the end o f the review period). The Bank
support provided to the Doula Infrastructure Project however ensured continuity o f dialogue and
support, as well as capacity to leverage donors' financing support with policy reforms and
capacity building in the sector. At the time o f writing, the I S N milestones have been met:
a) Regarding direct project activities to the benefit o f the Douala Urban Community, more
roads were built than was initially projected (27 km versus 23 km and travel time reduced
by more than 40% except one short leg. A credible survey will be prepared to confirm this
performance data before the project closes. (A QAG assessment undertaken o f the Doula
Infrastructure project in August 2004 deemed the project to be moderately unsatisfactory.
However, it was deemed too early to make a sound judgment on the project's contribution to
the CAS). The institutional component was probably not as successful, but capacity has
been partly built in the community for a better maintenance policy and adequate budgets for
road maintenance were provided during most o f the CAS and I S N period.

b) A component o f the Douala Infrastructure Project supported policy dialogue in the Urban
Development, Public Works and Transport areas. In the Public works sector, funding levels
for road maintenance, consistent with Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) signed by the
Government as part o f i t s dialogue with the European Union and other partners were
achieved for 2006,2007 and 2008, and the Douala Infrastructure Project contributed to

69

reinforce capacity in the sector. In the transport sector, the actual contributions o f the project
are going to be felt mostly after the review period (design o f a land transport strategy)
3 5 . Other significant outcomes achieved during the CAS and I S N period relate to those
arising from the Railway concession Project which was completed in June 2009 (The I C R i s
currently under preparation). These objectives supported the Government's Transport Sector
Strategy and Policy, which called for, among others, state divestiture o f transport operations in
favor o f greater private sector operations. In the last ISR, management comments were provided
regarding the satisfactory outcome o f this operation, the sustainability o f the concession from a
financial and operational standpoint and the reversal o f financing flows between the sector and
the government i s very significant results for the project. Moreover comparing the support to
the rail concession with all other concessions in Sub Saharan Africa, i t s performance was
considered to be one o f the best in the continent.

36. With regards to air transport, outcomes have only been partially met. Audits on security
have been undertaken but not in relation to security. This outcome has been supported by the
Bank through a regional project, namely the West and Central Africa Air Transport Safety and
Security Project. (The program's main objective i s to create a safe and secure environment for
air transport in the West and Central Africa region). Significant issues are being experienced
with disbursement delays. Other important outstanding actions relating to the implementation o f
security measures have to be undertaken before the Bank will consider an extension o f the
project (due to be completed in December 2009).
IV.
Energy and Urban
37. Increased access to and reliability o f electricity are key factors in the realization o f the
Government o f Cameroon's (GOC) growth and poverty reduction strategy. Achievements under
the privatization program are mixed. SAC I11 supported privatization o f SONEL (Societe
Nationale d'Electricit6). However, despite the privatization, the cost o f electricity has not
decreased and the electricity generation has not become more efficient. In the public utility
sector, the objectives o f raising the availability and quality o f service and o f raising the
efficiency o f service providers were not achieved, except in mobile telephony. Relevant I S N
milestones relating to increasing rural electricity and decreasing loss o f production have not yet
been met due to delays in effectiveness in Bank related activities. The Energy Sector
Development project became effective in April 2008 and the Urban and Water development
project in 2009, after the completion o f the ISN period.

3 8 . The overall project development objective o f the Urban and Water development project
was to increase access o f the urban population, particularly those living in low-income
settlements, to basic infrastructure and services, including water supply. At the time o f writing,
the likelihood o f achieving the project development remains high. Urban works are progressing
and capacity building efforts are underway to sustain efforts carried out through the project,
improve contract management and maintenance o f infrastructure at local level. Urgent water
rehabilitation works have started and about 20,000 connections, including 4,000 social
connections, have been installed, providing access to improved water to 100,000 people.
39. The overall project development objective o f the Energy Sector Development project i s
to increase access to modern energy in targeted rural areas and to improve the planning and
management o f sector resources by all energy sector institutions. Due to contractual delays, this

70

project reached effectiveness in January 2009, and i s experiencing significant disbursement
delays, One o f the components o f this project i s to undertake preparatory activities o f the L o m
Pangar Project.

40. With reference to lessons learnt, IEG reviews indicate that Cameroon’s experience with
the privatization program confirms that complex privatization programs should be accompanied
from the start b y well targeted TA operations and secondly, that they should be well sequenced
within a long time-frame, possibly over several operations. Bank teams should be attentive to
the frequent disparity in commitment between the political and administrative levels. Lastly,
small countries with limited resources should be encouraged to have a single multi-sector
regulatory authority.

41. Forests have a profound significance for poverty reduction in Cameroon. I t i s the largest
employer in rural areas; and represents an important area o f economic diversification, providing
a hedge against the national income to export price shocks implicit in the country’s significance
reliance on oil revenues. Good progress has been made by the Bank to meet the associated CAS
outcomes and I S N milestones; the Bank has been considerably involved in relevant sector
reforms over the past several years and has played an important role in coordinating
international partners’ support for the forestry sector in Cameroon (e.g., the code de conduite
established by the Bank between donors strongly reflected the goals o f the Paris Declaration).
Relevant support was provided by the I M F and the Bank within the framework o f the Third
Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC 111) which closed in March 2004. This was judged to be
satisfactory by IEG with significant outcomes achieved as a result o f the bank contributions.
These included (i)
a revamped institutional and regulatory framework, including a competitive
auction system for the award o f the logging rights and independent supervisory mechanisms,
which resulted in a much improved and more transparent forest management system. (ii)
the
appointment o f an independent observer to monitor these activities and to strengthen
the identification o f 10 percent o f the country’s territory as protected areas
accountability, (iii)
by the Government, (iv) an important shift from log-based to processed products exports and (v)
revenues from forest exploitation were redistributed more equitably to local communities. I t
was also noted by IEG that the considerable progress achieved in the forestry sector, (e.g.,
management, transparency, downstream activities and exports) was particularly important due
to the prevalent corruption and the vital importance o f the sector to the economy.
42. Milestones and CAS outcomes were largely met or exceeded. Bank contributions were
incorporated within the Forest and Environment Sector Operation. This represented an IDA and
GEF contribution towards a multi-donor national forest and environment sector development
program that was initiated and led by the Government o f Cameroon (due to close in December
2009). In terms o f progress, 69 percent o f forestry concessions have begun implementation o f
forest management plans. The forestry tax collection rate was achieved; in 2006, about $42
million were collected and $48 million in 2007. Local government bodies now receive shares
for local development; in 2007, CFAF 7 billion was transferred to local governments and rural
communities. In addition, in 299,238 communities had an approved Community Forest Simple
Management Plan. From this, 138 had signed the Management Convention with the
Government.
43. Some project difficulties have been experienced as a result o f the Government’s decision
to separate the Ministries o f Forestry and Environment. Nevertheless, other outstanding
conditions relating to the project are on track to be met. These include (i)
allocation o f funds
from the Government for implementation o f annual work plans in accordance with the METF
and that at least 75 percent o f the amount o f external contributions allocated in the previous year
72

w i l l have been made available in a timely fashion and used for program implementation, (ii)
an
audit o f completed forest management plans for community forests attributed before June 2005
establishment o f
and signed contracts with the companies that meet the requirements, (iii)
financial management and control systems within the Ministry o f Finance and Economy, and
(iv) implementation o f environmental plans and development o f adequate institutional capacity.
44. With respect to local development, The Bank has strong multi-sectoral experience in
local development in Cameroon, and has been instrumental in helping the Government to
develop and implement operations enabling communities to gain control over service delivery
and resources allocation. Good progress has been made by the Bank in relation to achieving
related CAS outcomes and ISN milestones.

45. Bank support directed towards meeting the CAS outcome to ensure that farmers reached
by extension services derive productivity benefits was incorporated within the National
Agricultural Extension and Research Program Support Project, designed to improve agricultural
productivity and incomes in Cameroon in a sustainable way. This was a follow-on intervention
to the National Project for Agricultural Extension (PNVA) and was completed in June 2004.
The project was judged to be satisfactory by IEG. Significant outcomes included improvements
to the extension service exceeded targets, 879 farmers received training in seed multiplication,
1,277 subprojects were grant-funded, providing equipment and small-scale infrastructure to
producer organizations (the target was 700 subproject grants), the project strengthened the
formation o f producer groups and promoted community-led development planning and a pilot
operation helped 70-100 villages to prepare community development plans. The results o f this
pilot fed into preparation o f a broader community development program.
46. The Bank provided further support to achieving local community development related
outcomes and milestones through i t s Community Development Program, (Projet d’appui au
Programme National de DCveloppement Participatif - PAPNDP). The first phase o f the
program was designed to assist the GOC to (i)establish a system for channeling funds to rural
communities to finance prioritized collective infrastructures, (ii)
strengthen the capacity o f
communities to manage their own development and (iii)
improve the legal and regulatory
framework for decentralized rural development. The Bank’s sustainable Agro-pastoral and land
management promotion project (GEF) was blended with the Community Development Program
Support project in order to strengthen Government support and development effectiveness with
increased donor participation. The project i s due to reach completion in 201 1. Significant
progress has been made in relation to the CAS outcomes and ISN milestones, particularly in
relation to the respective progress recorded in the I S N in November 2006 (pg 11). For example,
targets have now been exceeded in terms o f numbers o f people with improved access to water
sources and sanitation facilities. According to the last ISR, approximately 16 health care
facilities had been constructed which resulted in an additional 58,000 people with access to
improved health centers. This number i s likely to continue to increase by an additional 30,000
by late 2009. Finally, to date, approximately an additional 102,000 people have access to
education. This number i s also likely to grow during the course o f the project. The Government
i s currently in the process o f approving the second phase o f PNDP.
47. During preparation o f the Chad-Cameroon pipeline (the Petroleum Development and
Pipeline Project (PDPP), the need for capacity building was identified in several areas,
including oil-revenue management in Chad, environmental monitoring in both countries, and
73

petroleum sector development in Chad. Ultimately, an IDA-funded capacity building program
included three operations. The Petroleum Environment Capacity Enhancement project (capece)
was one o f these three operations and closed in November 2007. A separate IEG review was
undertaken o f this project; overall bank performance i s rated moderately satisfactory but based
on modest ratings for relevance, efficacy and efficiency, the overall outcome was rated
unsatisfactory.

48. Activities not undertaken in this outcome cluster include the Rural Investment Climate,
and the Avian and Human Influenza Facility Grant.
49. Lessons learnt in relation to the projects undertaken during the CAS/ISN period relate to
(i)project design and to avoid the temptation o f incorporation too many interventions, (ii)
capacity building operations can work in a complementary manner with investment projects and
(iii)the provision o f grant-funding for productive equipment and infrastructure can fruitfully be
combined with attempts to strengthen farmer organizations and boost incomes. In the case o f
the Agricultural Extension and Research Program Support Project, the infrastructure helped to
increase farmer solidarity while enabling them to increase farm output and revenues.

V.
Health Sector
50. Cameroon performs poorly on health-related MDGs, and continues to experience a
generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic with a prevalence rate o f 5.5 percent. Most key indicators o f
child health and nutrition within Cameroon have stagnated or worsened since 1990 with a few
exceptions (e.g., immunizations). The 2001-2010 Health Sector Strategy served as the
overarching framework in the sector. Since i t s launch in 2002, some important organizational
and institutional improvements have been introduced but in spite o f these improvements, the
sector faces important challenges. These include (i)
excessive centralization o f the health care
system, (ii)
human resource issues, (iii)
high costs which hinder access remains (iv) low amount
o f public funding, (v) cumbersome and slow flow o f public funding, (vi) governance issues and
(vii) fragmented and unreliable monitoring and evaluation systems. Drawing lessons from the
mid-term review, the Ministry o f Health launched a participatory process to prepare an
enhanced and revamped strategy.

5 1. Against this backdrop, little progress was made during the CAS/ISN period towards
meeting the respective outcomes and milestones. Bank efforts to support the fight against
HIV/AIDs within the Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS operation (MAPS I)were deemed to be highly
unsatisfactory by IEG. As noted in the I S N (pg 11) the project team was able to launch a large
number o f activities; examples included three campaigns to influence behavioral change,
support to community action plans was provided in 6,000 communities, and the I S N milestone
relating to the number o f HIV+pregnant women who received anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) was
exceeded (from 499 in 2002 to 4,780 in 2006). MAPS Ialso supported a pilot ARV program
which expanded access.to AIDS treatment to vulnerable groups. In spite o f this progress,
adequate monitoring and evaluation was a significant failing o f the project and made i t almost
impossible to assess bank contributions. In addition, supervision o f the project became
extremely difficult due to the large number o f activities and partners involved.
52. The I S N health-related outcomes were revised significantly from the CAS to reflect the
shift in Government commitment towards a more participatory process in the preparation,
enhancement and update o f i t s strategy. It also focused on the attainment o f the MDGs. The
Country team decided to drop the PRSC, defer MAPSI1 and to focus resources on the
development o f a Sector-wide Approach (Swap) in collaboration with the Government and
other major health sector partners. Designed to support the implementation o f the updated
Health Sector Strategy, the project development objective was to increase utilization and
improve the quality o f health services with a particular focus on child and maternal health and
75

communicable diseases. (The HIV/AIDS medical related interventions are increasingly going to
be mainstreamed through the SWaP).
53. The project became effective in March 2009. To date, significant delays have been
experienced in relation to slow response on the ground, disbursements, lack o f progress on
implementation o f key reforms and lack o f progress on Monitoring and Evaluation.
Nevertheless, with careful supervision as well as increased government commitment,
performance i s s t i l l expected to improve over time. The.Bank’s recent co-financing o f the 2010
Demographic and Health Survey, which i s now underway, i s also expected to contribute
towards stronger baseline data for the national program.

VI.
Education Sector
54. Cameroon i s likely to be on track to meet the education MDG o f primary education
completion rate, The Bank’s Education Development capacity-building project, (Programme
d’Appui au Systkme Educatif, PASE), initiated during the CAS period in 2005 was designed to
support the respective Government objectives in i t s PRSP, and in particular to reinforce the
capacity o f the various ministries with responsibility for education. The objective o f the
proposed project was to increase the efficiency and equity o f primary and secondary education,
with a focus on disadvantaged areas, and increase capacity for high quality training in targeted
disciplines in higher education. These goals were reaffirmed during the I S N period with the
objective to contribute towards the Government’s higher level goal to reduce repetition rates
from 30 percent to 10 percent at the national level by 2015. With respect to the milestone and
CAS outcome indicators, marginal improvement was registered in the reduction o f primary
repetition rates from 25 percent in 2005 to 22 percent in 2007. D o we know rate for 2008? The
primary completion rate exceeded targets and increased from 60 percent in 2003 to 82 percent
in October 2007. The student teacher ratio fell from 56 percent to 52 percent in 2008.
55. In spite o f the progress made, the Bank’s project was designed for implementation in a
very weak overall environment, from which the World Bank and other major donors had been
largely absent for many years due to governance concerns. A review o f the Education
Development Capacity Building project, undertaken in May 2008 by QAG (QALP-l), rated the
project as unsatisfactory. Implementation was adversely affected by weak management
capacity, lack o f reliable statistical data, concerns about governance and corruption and a highly
complex institutional environment. In addition, the review asserted that the development
outcomes were unlikely to be met due to issues relating to poor design, without clear l i n k s
between activities, indicators and objectives. On the basis o f the QALP results and the request
from government, a restructuring effort has been initiated by the Bank to revise the DPO and
the results framework and to reorganize existing and planned activities under four new
components. Steps have also been undertaken to improve inter-ministerial coordination. The
QAG now also notes evidence o f improved disbursement during 2009.
56. Lessons learnt from the QALP review relate to project design; a more open-ended project
design may be appropriate in areas in which the Bank has been largely absent from substantive
policy dialogue over time, and where there are many unknowns about opportunities to leverage
change. If Government commitment to key reforms i s not clear from the beginning, an approach
based upon technical assistance or building dialogue may be more appropriate. Lastly, in spite
o f clear advantages related to implementing a broad sectoral approach, the Bank needs to be
cognizant o f the risks associated with complex parallel structures.

World Bank Group Performance - Portfolio Management
V.
J. I D A Lending

57. Portfolio composition. During the FY04-06 CAS implementation period, three o f the
seven I D A operations planned were approved by the Board totaling US$63.2 million. They
were the Community Development'Program Support Project (US$20 million); the Education
Development Capacity-Building Project (US$18.2 million); and the Forest and Environment
Sector Program (US$25 million) originally planned for FY04 but approved only in FY06. The
Board also approved a regional operation (the West and Central Africa Air Transport Safety and
Security Project that included US$14.5 million o f support to Cameroon, as well as two Global
Environment Facility (GEF) operations complementing the Forestry and Environment operation
(US$lO million) and Community Development Program (US$6 million). In addition, after
Cameroon reached the HIPC Completion point, an IDA grant was committed to prepay IBRD
debt outstanding at the completion point. (The Energy Sector Support Project (US$lO million)
initially planned for FY05 slipped to FY08).

58. There was a slower than anticipated delivery o f new operations during the CAS
implementation period which reflected Cameroon's uneven performance during the CAS
period. Operations approved in FY06 were delivered in the form o f grants due to delays in
reaching the HIPC completion point as well as Cameroon's debt vulnerability. New IDA
commitments during the CAS implementation period amounted to U S $ l 10 million which was
lower than the US$125 million forecast in the CAS base-case scenario.
59. During the I S N period, a balance o f approximately US$ 220 million was made available
for I D A operations. Additional resources o f US$50 million were also added to the IDA
allocation as a result o f the HIPC and MDRI debt relief. Delivery o f new operations improved
significantly; in five IDA lending operations and one supplemental credit were approved
totaling US$240 million, and in line with the indicative financing envelope. These included the
Urban and Water Development Support project (US$80 million), the Transparency &
Accountability Capacity Development Project (US$15 million), the Energy Sector Development
Project (US$65 million), and the Health Sector Support Swap Project (S$25 million). In
addition, the Board approved the Environmental and Social capacity building for Energy project
(US$20 million). Part o f this amount (US$35 million) related to a regional operation, the
Regional Transport and Transit Facilitation Project (the remaining amount o f the project o f
US$112 million was financed from the Regional Integration allocation). Both the Multi-Sector
HIV/AIDS MAP11 and the regional CEMAC Regional Financial Institutions projects, initially
planned for FY08 were deferred.
60. Portfolio Age. As o f December 2008, the portfolio age was somewhat young; the average
age for the 10 projects under implementation was 2.7 years. A total o f seven projects exited the
portfolio during the CAS and ISN period (FY04-FY08); the average age for those seven closed
projects was six years.
6 1. Portfolio Performance. The number o f projects under implementation grew during the
CAS/ISN period from seven to 10 projects. During this time, the percent o f active projects at
risk decreased substantially from 33.7 percent in 2004 to 5 percent in 2008 (in terms o f
amounts). This represented a significant improvement over that o f previous years. On the other
hand, disbursement ratios deteriorated during the period in question, from 29.7 percent in 2004
77

to 1 1.9 percent in 2008 reflecting start up and implementation delays, as well as other issues
including financial management and counterpart funding. In response, in addition to focus on
supervision, the Bank has hired specialist consultants to assist to identify and overcome the root
causes for disbursement delays as well as to strengthen Bank representation and expertise in the
country office.
Design and Quality at Entry. One project was rated for Quality-at-Entry by Q A G during
the CAS/ISN period (FY04-05) and again in the Quality assessment o f Lending Portfolio
(QALP) in May 2008, namely the Education development capacity-building project. In the
Quality-of-Entry review, the project received a moderately satisfactory rating. Strong aspects o f
the project related to (i)the consistency o f project objectives with the respective CAS pillar, (ii)
the very effective former policy dialogue and preparatory work undertaken with the
Government, (iii)
the clarity o f project components and sub-components, (iv) the economic and
financial analyses and (v) the M&E framework. Areas for improvement identified in the report
included (i)the behavioral l i n k s between planned interventions and outcome targets (ii)
weak
integration o f the higher education component with issues addressed at the primary and
secondary level, (iii)the lack o f clarity regarding how the GDLN will advance the project’s Dos
and (iv) further opportunities to improve social development impact could have been exploited.
In the QALP review, with respect to the likelihood o f the project reaching its Development
Objectives, the project received an unlikely. Issues noted relate to significant issues with
implementation and delays with the PIU, as well as significant obstacles to coordination as a
result o f the multiplicity o f ministries. A t the same time, the panel noted evidence o f improved
disbursement and the lag time seen in improvement o f certain indicators which reflected efforts
to build capacity within the Ministries.

62.

63. Quality of Supervision. One project was rated for Quality o f Supervision by QAG during
the CAS/ISN period in August 2004: the Cameroon Doula Infrastructure project was rated as
moderately unsatisfactory overall. Main problems encountered related to procurement delays
and lack o f road maintenance in the Doula municipality.
64. Closedprojects. With respect to projects that exited the portfolio, four out o f seven
projects received satisfactory ratings across all o f the five performance categories in IEG
reviews. This included the Transport Sector Privatization Project, the National Agricultural
Extension and Research Program Support Project, the Cameroon SAC I11 as well as the Debt
Relief Grant. In terms o f outcomes, two projects, namely the Cameroon Petroleum Environment
Capacity Enhancement Project and the Public-Private partnership for growth Project were rated
unsatisfactory and the Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS project was rated highly unsatisfactory. Issues
related to lack o f government commitment, borrower performance, fiduciary and safeguard
related issues as well as poor project design, management, supervision and M&E.

K. IDA Non-lending
During the CAS/ISN implementation period, significant efforts were undertaken to
65.
update the stock o f country knowledge covered by core diagnostics. During the CAS period,
AAA efforts included sector work in the education, health, and urban sectors; a Development
Policy Review; a Poverty Assessment; a Country Procurement Assessment Review; and a
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review. An Investment Climate
Assessment and a Report on the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) for accounting
and auditing was also completed. In addition to these activities, considerable support was
78

provided towards implementing E I T I and Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness, as well as
stepped-up support for managing the structural reform agenda under the HIPC process,
including intensive analytical and advisory support on the energy sector.
66. Economic and Sector Work (ESW. QAG rated four o f the six assessed products
including all o f the core diagnostic ESW tasks in i t s sample completed during the FY04-06
CAS implementation period as highly satisfactory or satisfactory, compared to the marginally
unsatisfactory overall performance rating for FY02-05. The QAG assessment highlighted Bank
inputs and processes, coherence and integration, and dissemination as areas need further
improvement.
67. Technical Assistance and Policy Advice. AAA efforts during the I S N period were
designed to reinforce the Bank’s financing program, with primary focus on areas o f pressing
concern to the Government. Support included continuation o f the policy dialogue and technical
assistance in key areas o f Bank Group engagement, outreach and dissemination o f key pieces o f
analytical work completed in FY06, and analysis o f emerging issues, including the
anticorruption agenda. The FY07-08 work program focused on sector dialogue and knowledge
generation on governance including corruption (coordinated anticorruption support with other
development partners, dissemination o f the Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review and EITI and private sector development (dissemination o f the
Investment Climate Assessment and ROSC and support to the set up o f the national investment
forum.
68. Financing Instruments. During the CASASN period, IDA funding continued to be
predominantly in the form o f investment lending. In May 2006, the Government and i t s major
health sector partners agreed to develop a Swap to support the design and implementation o f the
updated health sector strategy.

VI.
Aid Coordination/Donor harmonization
69. Partnerships. Cameroon i s one o f the least aid-dependent countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa, with a small number o f development partners. The HIPC completion point marked a
significant shift in the relationship between the Government and international development
partners. The Bank has pursued i t s activities in close collaboration with partners, examples
include efforts to support the Government’s leadership in implementing the Paris Declaration on
aid effectiveness, including developing more effective coordination and dialogue mechanisms
centered on the PRSP, and moving toward sector-wide approaches, for example, the Swap
support to the health sector.
70. Client surveys were undertaken at the end o f the CAS period in FY05 as well as in FY09.
In 2009 the Bank received a rating o f 6.6, on a ten point scale, that the Bank has been working

with other donor partners to foster the alignment and harmonization o f donor support with the
requirements o f Cameroon’s national development strategy, and a 6.5 rating that the Bank has
been adequately encouraging the Government to lead the coordination o f i t s donor partners. The
Bank was also perceived to be fairly effective at promoting the inclusion o f others in the
development o f strategies, including civil society, private sector, local communities and local
project experts.

79

VII. Client Feedback
71. Client surveys were undertaken at the end o f the CAS period in FY05 as well as in FY09.
Lessons from the FY05 client survey, which captured the views o f stakeholders in Cameroon,
recent analytical work, annual PRSP progress re orts and an independent assessment o f
partnerships and aid relationships in Cameroon2 f were incorporated within the I S N .
72. In FY09, a total o f 258 stakeholders participated in the country survey, drawn from
different organizations and sectors. Employees o f ministries comprised the largest percentage o f
respondents (23%), followed by the private sector (1 5%), media (1 l%),
academics (lo%),
NGOs (9%), Office o f the President (7%) and Local government (7%). A small number o f
responses were received by Parliamentarians, faith-based groups, bilateral or multilateral
agencies and other organizations. The majority o f respondents indicated that they came from
Yaounde (67%). Nearly three-quarters o f all respondents indicated that they have been involved
with or a close observer o f World Bank activities for more than three years.
73. In term o f general issues facing Cameroon, improving governance was considered to be
the most important development priority for Cameroon; a total 52 percent o f respondents had
either marked this as the first or second most important priority. This amount had increased
significantly from FY05 where respondents had rated improving government effectiveness and
reducing corruption equally (32 percent o f respondents). Corruption was considered to be the
second most important priority (28 percent o f respondents) followed by improving the
investment/business climate (24 percent). Other respondents had rated improving basic
infrastructure, increasing employment, achieving universal access to education and controlling
the spread o f HIV/AIDs as the most important development priorities.
74. With respect to areas which would contribute most to poverty reduction, 30 percent o f
respondents indicated that improving governance and agriculture development would be most
significant. Infrastructure development, reducing corruption and increasing employment were
also seen as key to reducing poverty in the FY09 survey. These views varied considerably
according to the different stakeholders; for example, respondents from the office o f the
President indicated that infrastructure development would contribute most to poverty reduction,
employees o f ministries felt that improving governance and increasing employment generating
opportunities would be most significant and parliamentarians and respondents from the private
sector indicated that agriculture development would have the most impact.
75. Across all respondents, the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Cameroon received a mean
rating o f 5.2 on a 10 point scale, with 1 being very unfavorable and 10 being very favorable.
This was a slight decline from the rating o f 5.6 in the client survey o f FY05. In terms o f i t s
poverty mission, the Bank was perceived as somewhat effective at giving appropriate priority to
poverty reduction in Cameroon - receiving a mean rating o f 3.2 across all respondents on a 5
point scale.
Respondents indicated that the Bank’s greatest values to Cameroon were its financial
resources and policy and economic advice. The Bank’s knowledge and lending were also highly
valued. There was strong agreement that the Bank aligned i t s programs and approaches with the
76.

Une Arrive‘e et un Nouveau De‘part :Partenariats au Cameroun aprks le Point achtvement PPTE, Overseas
Development Institute, July 2006.

2o

80

requirements o f Cameroon’s PRSP. More specifically, respondents in this year’s country survey
gave significantly higher ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness at helping to improve the quality
o f l i f e in urban areas and helping to strengthen the transport and power and energy sectors
compared to respondents from the FY05 country survey. Respondents also saw the Bank as
most effective at ensuring that attention i s paid to the environmental impact o f Bank programs
and safeguarding against corruption in projects. Other areas o f effectiveness related to
improving service delivery in the health and education sectors, helping to strengthen
infrastructure development and ensuring that attention i s paid to gender disparities.

77.
With respect to improvements, 30 percent o f respondents indicated that the Bank should
reduce the complexity o f obtaining Bank financing and improve the quality o f its experts as
related to Cameroon’s specific challenges. Specific areas o f weakness related to the Bank
imposing technocratic solutions without regard to political realities (44 percent o f respondents)
and being too bureaucratic in i t s operational policies and procedures (41 percent o f
respondents). Overall, suggested areas for improvement include:

-

Accessibility
Improving how i t s operational policies and procedures are aligned with country demand
Helping government lead on donor coordination
Reducing complexity o f obtaining the World Bank financing
Balancing level o f relevant expertise as the country’s specific challenges

78. Going forward, the survey indicated that the Bank i s expected to play a somewhat
significant role in Cameroon’s development over the medium term. In addition, 62% o f all
respondents indicated that the Bank should be more involved in Cameroon’s development
strategies.

VIII. Conclusions and Lessons
79. Against a backdrop from which the World Bank and other major donors have been
largely absent for many years due to governance concerns, as well as a changing development
context, during the CAS/ISN period, the Bank recorded strong performances in some outcome
clusters and sectors and only modest progress in others.
80. Cameroon’s uneven performance during the CAS period resulted in a slower than
anticipated delivery o f new operations, making outcomes difficult to achieve; new I D A
commitments during the CAS implementation period were lower than CAS base-case scenario.
During the I S N period, however, delivery o f new operations doubled (from US$110 million to
US$240 million), and the number o f projects under implementation grew seven to 10 projects.
During this time, the percent o f active projects at risk also decreased substantially from 33.7
percent in 2004 to 5 percent in 2008 (in terms o f amounts) which also represented a significant
improvement over that o f previous years.
8 1. The CAS objectives in the I S N were changed somewhat at the end o f the CAS period to
reflect changes in the external environment, for example, an additional outcome cluster was
added to support the revision o f the PRSP. In addition, the reorganization o f existing CAS
outcomes into six outcome clusters improved implementation as well as actions undertaken to
81

strengthen the country office and monitoring o f the ISN. These actions included (i)
the
decentralization o f several international staff to the field (ii)
strengthening o f support and
expertise for forestry and environment and rural and agriculture development and an
infrastructure specialist, (iii)
the appointment o f a senior private sector expert to fully integrate
World Bank Group activities in support o f the private sector (and iv) a decrease in the number
o f single -standing missions, replaced by joint missions with other international partners.
82. During the ISN period, good progress was made in supporting infrastructure and urban
development as well as in supporting forestry and environment sectors and strengthening rural
and agricultural development. Respective IEG reviews o f ICRs confirm strong results and a
strong likelihood o f meeting development goals. The Bank has been instrumental in helping the
Government to develop and implement operations enabling communities to gain control over
service delivery and resource allocation. With respect to outcomes and milestones relating to
governance and the PRSP outcome cluster, the Bank has provided important contributions
which have laid the groundwork for future impact. Examples include the Debt Relief Grant
under the Enhanced HIPC initiative as well as the Development Policy Review and Poverty
Assessment. Little progress was made in achieving the outcomes and milestones in private
sector development and the health sector. In particular, Cameroon continues to make very slow
progress with respect to i t s indicators relating to starting a new business.
83. As reflected in the deteriorating disbursement ratios, many o f the planned projects
experienced start up and implementation effectiveness delays during the I S N period, suggesting
that actual contributions are going to be felt mostly after the review period. Projects include the
CEMAC Regional Institutions Support Project, the Energy Sector Development Project and the
Urban and Water development project. In response, the Bank has hired specialist consultants to
assist to identify and overcome the root causes for delays. Other projects such as the Education
Development Capacity Building project was significantly restructured in response to feedback
and learning QALP results.

Key lessons for the Bank Group include :
Simpler project design to ensure a fit with Government’s implementation capacity. In
addition, more open-ended project designs may be appropriate in areas in which the Bank
has been largely absent from substantive policy dialogue over time for example, the
Education sector.
Other IEG reviews have indicated the importance o f effective supervision and monitoring
and evaluation systems with a recommendation to withdraw from certain projects if
considerable opposition and delay are encountered. Bank teams should be attentive to the
frequent disparity in commitment between the political and administrative levels.
The provision o f grant funding for productive equipment and infrastructure can be
fruitfully combined with attempts to strengthen farmer organizations and boost incomes,
as demonstrated in the Agricultural Extension and Research Program Support Project.
Overall the Bank continues to face considerable challenges in developing reliable data
baselines for key performance indicators due to lack o f availability o f solid data. For
example, key lessons learnt in relation to the M A P project (stemming from the IEG

82

review), included the importance o f an accurate assessment o f the baseline situation
which i s critical to designing and evaluating an effective project.
