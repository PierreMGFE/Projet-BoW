EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
‘Gross National Happiness’ (GNH) is the philosophy which forms the cornerstone of
Bhutan’s development and which Bhutan is succeeding in implementing. Introduced by the Fourth
King of Bhutan in the 1970s, GNH presents an alternative model for development which places equal
weight on the social, spiritual, intellectual, cultural and emotional needs of a society as it does on
material and economic gain. The GNH philosophy today garners considerable attention as many
nations, both developed and developing, assess the merits of development and, in particular, the
extent to which their people’s sense of well-being and happiness is reflected by their levels of
material and economic gain.
ii.
Bhutan represents a bastion of peace and stability in South Asia. Inherent in its Buddhist
philosophy and committed to the overarching goals Gross National Happiness – sustainable
development, preservation of cultural values, conservation of the environment and good governance - Bhutan today enjoys a number of development assets, including strong ownership of the
development process, low levels of corruption, robust institutions, a well educated and dedicated civil
service and visionary leadership. Bhutan is well poised to consolidate and expand on the numerous
impressive gains it has achieved since the advent of development planning and its recent smooth
transition to democracy.
iii.
Today Bhutan faces a new set of challenges as it experiences rapid transition from a mostly
agrarian society to one characterized by increasing levels of education, shifting expectations and
changing demographics, particularly among the country’s youth for whom rural life and farming hold
little appeal. With increasing urban drift and limited opportunities for securing public sector
employment, the Royal Government is challenged to identify strategies to diversify the economy for
creating employment while, simultaneously, ensuring that underserved populations – both rural
dwellers in remote parts of the country and new urban populations -- have access to basic services and
infrastructure. The impetus to deliver services, including roads, water supply, electricity, and health
and education facilities is compounded by Bhutan’s new system of democratic governance whereby
the wishes and demands of constituents must be responded to.
iv.
Bhutan is blessed with abundant water resources which offer enormous potential for the
generation and sale of hydro-electricity. Bhutan enjoys close physical proximity to and strong ties
with neighbouring India which itself is experiencing rapid economic development and social
transformation. Given India’s current and future need for a reliable supply of electricity, the future for
Bhutan’s economic growth appears bright. A number of large hydropower projects, financed by India,
are planned over the coming decade to tap into the country’s abundant hydropower generation
capacity, of which only five percent is presently harnessed. Using revenues gained from hydropower
sales, the Royal Government’s long-term plan, as articulated in its Bhutan 2020 vision, is to achieve
economic self-reliance and the provision of quality services for the entire population.
v.
While hydropower generation will bring increased economic gain to Bhutan, it will not be
major source of employment. There are also risks from being dependent on a single market (India)
for the sale of a single commodity (electricity), including natural disasters and the possible effects of
climate change, particularly if the glacial melt which feeds Bhutan’s rivers is altered. For these
reasons, Bhutan seeks economic diversification along with prudent planning for and management of
resources. In forging new pathways forward to achieve economic diversification, to keep pace with
globalization trends, particularly in ICT and education, and to address new challenges resulting from
the country’s development successes to date, the Royal Government has articulated a vision to create

i

a ‘knowledge-based society, with private sector development as the engine for growth, ICT as the
platform, underscored by strategic infrastructure’.
vi.
This Country Partnership Strategy aims to support Bhutan in laying the foundations for
achieving this long-term vision. The CPS will align with the country’s Tenth Five-Year Plan (FY0813) in support of the Royal Government’s efforts to: (a) diversify the economy and generate
employment through private sector growth, and (b) provide services to populations in rural
and expanding urban areas that lack them while addressing emerging social challenges. The CPS
program defines a set of outcomes that it expects to influence and associated milestones to track
progress. The outcomes are organized around four clusters that include: (i) creating more favorable
conditions to create businesses and accessing credit; (ii) reforming the educational system to enable it
to deliver the skills needed for diversification; (iii) providing infrastructure to expanding urban and
connecting isolated rural areas, where rural development needs better access to market, and (iv)
charting a new agenda for meeting emerging social challenges in health and education while
increasing the effectiveness in the use of public resources. To help achieve these results, the CPS
identifies two cross-cutting themes embedded throughout the program: (I) capacity building for good
governance, and (II) environmental sustainability. The CPS spans the remaining three years of the
Royal Government’s 10th Five-Year Plan and the first year of the 11th Five-Year Plan. It has been
developed, therefore, to ensure sufficient flexibility to align to new priorities of the Royal
Government under the next national development plan.
vii.
As a joint World Bank-International Finance Corporation (IFC) strategy, the CPS seeks to
exploit the comparative strengths and advantages of each agency and coordinate their interventions to
support achievement of the CPS’ objectives. The International Development Association (IDA) will
seek to leverage its limited allocation through strategic partnerships with government and
development partners using best practices. Bhutan’s IDA envelope for FY11–14 is indicatively set at
SDR49 million (approximately US$75 million equivalent). The proposed IDA program, including
lending and analytical and advisory activities (AAA), will be sequenced such that AAA underpins
lending and lending reflects a 60/40 split between budget support operations and specific investments,
respectively. IFC’s focus areas take into account its three strategic pillars for South Asia operations:
(1) inclusive growth; (2) climate change adaptation and mitigation; and (3) global/regional
integration.
viii.
This CPS takes a medium- to long-term vision of Bhutan as a middle income country. The
World Bank expects that positive and timely implementation of the CPS program will pave the way
for Bhutan to move to IDA-IBRD blend status under the next CPS. As of 2010, Bhutan has moved to
hardened IDA credit terms which are expected to prevail throughout this CPS period. Given Bhutan’s
likely transition from IDA-only status after this CPS period, this strategy emphasizes the World Bank
Group’s partnership with Bhutan over its assistance.
ix.
Two broad sets of risks may impact implementation of the CPS. The first set of risks is
related to factors endogenous to the implementation environment and reflective of Bhutan’s specific
development challenges and levels of progress. These include macroeconomic volatility and capacity
limitations. The second set of risks is related to the design of the program itself given that some key
issues which the CPS might address and subsequent activities to address them are yet to be defined.
While no major risks are likely to derail the country program, there are some risks which may affect
implementation progress and for which mitigation measures will be in place.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Bhutan faces a new reality brought on by its past development successes. The increasing
numbers of youth completing the full cycle of basic education and beyond face a nascent private sector
and few opportunities for public sector employment. To the unprecedented pressure of rising youth
unemployment are added the complex issues associated with rural-urban migration and rapidly expanding
urban settlements. Bhutan’s challenge, then, is to increase economic growth and diversification to expand
opportunities for employment while equipping the labor force with modern skills that support
diversification. Further, a balanced development in rural and urban areas requires both continued
expansion of basic infrastructure and quality services in growing urban centers while simultaneously
ensuring that rural parts of the country have the services, infrastructure and opportunities people need for
an improved standard of living and to make rural life more appealing overall.
2.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) provides a framework for World Bank Group
support to Bhutan during fiscal years (FY) 2011–14. It is aligned with Bhutan’s Tenth Five-Year Plan
through 2013 and will cover the first year of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan starting in July 2013 (FY14).
Under the overarching goal of increasing people’s ‘Gross National Happiness’, the philosophical
cornerstone of Bhutan’s development vision and path, the CPS follows a strategic approach that focuses
on results in key strategic areas to support Bhutan in realizing its vision of creating a ‘knowledge-based
society with private sector as the engine for growth, ICT as the platform, underscored by strategic
infrastructure’.
3.
The CPS has been developed in partnership between the World Bank and the International
Finance Corporation (IFC). The goal of a joint Bank-IFC CPS is to maximize and leverage the
strengths of each organization in order to provide a coherent and consolidated development assistance
strategy for Bhutan.
COUNTRY CONTEXT
4.
Bhutan is a small mountainous landlocked country in South Asia located in the eastern
Himalayas and bordered by India and China. According to the last census in 2005, its population is
approximately 696,000, spread over an area of 38,394 sq kms and roughly the size of Switzerland. Bhutan
has approximately 70 percent of its land area still under forest cover, although less than two percent of
land is suitable for cultivation. Given its location between the Indian and Asian tectonic plates, Bhutan is
prone to earthquakes. It also experiences frequent landslides, particularly during the summer monsoon
season, as well as forest fires, wind storms and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).
5.
Bhutan has abundant water resources. It is well placed to take advantage of its location next to
India for the sale of hydropower. Hydropower is the principle driver for economic growth. Bhutan
currently exploits an estimated five percent of its total hydropower generation capacity and plans to have
10,000 MW of hydropower generation capacity by 2020.
6.
Almost two-thirds of the population is classified as rural. The majority of the population lives
in the central highlands. While steadily decreasing overall, poverty in Bhutan is concentrated in isolated
rural areas. These areas have limited income opportunities and a high cost of service delivery. Service
delivery is hampered by difficult terrain and scattered settlements. There are higher concentrations of
population in the southern belt of the country bordering poor regions of northern India. The capital,
Thimphu, has a population of approximately 120,000 people and lies in the western part of the country, as
does the town of Paro, where the country’s only airport is located, from where Bhutan has direct air links
to India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand.

1

7.
Bhutan is a global biodiversity hotspot. It has a strong track record for environmental
stewardship. Centuries of isolationism, a small population and topographical extremes have led to Bhutan
maintaining one of the most intact ecosystems in the world. The country ranks amongst the top ten
countries in the world in terms of species density (i.e. the number of species per unit area).
A.

Political and Economic Context
i.

Political Economy and Governance

8.
In 2008, Bhutan transitioned smoothly from an absolute monarchy to multi-party
democracy. His Majesty King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck is the nominal head of state.
Executive power resides in the government led by the Prime Minister. The transition to democratic
governance was the outcome of a decade of preparations led by the Fourth King Jigme Singye
Wangchuck who abdicated in 2007. These included the establishment of numerous constitutional bodies,
including an election commission, an anti-corruption commission and an independent auditor-general.
While public sentiment was generally not in favour of democracy -- preferring, rather, continued
governance by the country’s monarchs -- the Fourth King deemed it in his people’s long-term interest to
ensure that power rests in their hands. The current and first elected Royal Government of Bhutan consists
of a parliamentary majority of 45 of 47 seats in the National Assembly.
9.
Good governance has been a continued priority for the Royal Government. Bhutan stands
out in the region with overall low levels of corruption and robust institutions to support transparent
governance. Bhutan scores well on the WBI Governance Research Indicators score for ‘control of
corruption’, and is at the 75th percentile worldwide. The 2010 Transparency International Corruption
Perception Index score for Bhutan is 5.7, making Bhutan the least corrupt country in South Asia and 36th
least corrupt out of 178 nations globally, up from 49th position out of 180 nations in 2009 with a score of
5.0. Bhutan enjoys relative peace and stability. The institutions of democracy, while still young, have
taken firm root and provide a solid foundation for ensuring the rule of law and transparent governance
with adequate checks and balances.
10.
Bhutan has a strong record of social policy. This is characterized by equity and commitment on
the part of the state to ensure a minimal level of access and quality in the provision of social services.
This has yielded a relatively well educated population of young Bhutanese who have benefited from an
English-medium education, thus facilitating access to information and learning outside Bhutan’s boarders
in an increasingly inter-connected world.
11.
Bhutan enjoys a high level of confidence on the part of its development partners. This stems
from good planning capacity and the building of strong and transparent systems of fiduciary functioning.
This level of good governance allows for the effective use of aid and concerted focus on the development
issues at hand, with relatively little distraction from what is elsewhere a major preoccupation with the
barriers of poor governance, corruption and indifference.
12.
Bhutan’s development has been one of broad-based progress. This has been achieved under
the guidance of a strong lineage of monarchs who have led the way in establishing the conditions for
development while articulating the nation’s approach to modernization. Today, Bhutan enjoys numerous
‘development assets’: (i) low corruption; (ii) ability to delivery services; (iii) peace and stability; and (iv)
robust institutions. Additionally, Bhutanese society emphasizes inclusiveness, places particular
importance on the equal status of women and is unencumbered by a caste system of social hierarchy.

ii.

Recent Economic Developments

13.
Economic growth has slowed down recently. Bhutan grew at an average real rate of nine
percent per annum during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (2002/03–2007/08, extended by one year).
This was driven largely by hydropower development, as Bhutan started to effectively tap into its 23,760
MW hydropower potential1. Annual real GDP growth exceeded 13 percent and 11 percent in 2006/07 and
2007/08 respectively, as the 1020 MW Tala hydropower project came on-stream in 2006/07, trebling
Bhutan’s power generation capacity (Figure 1). However, economic growth slowed in 2008/09 and
2009/10 to about 5.7 percent and 6.6 percent respectively, as the effects of the Tala hydropower project
wore off. Construction work on new hydropower projects has been the key source of growth during the
last two years.
14.
RGoB’s overall fiscal stance has been prudent. Domestic revenues consistently cover current
expenditures. The fiscal deficit, including grants, has averaged 2.5 percent during the 9FYP, in-line with
RGoB’s target of maintaining it below 5 percent. However, volatility has been an issue with the fiscal
balance varying from a deficit of 12 percent of GDP in 2002/03 to a surplus of over 7 percent of GDP in
2006/07. For its revenues, Bhutan relies heavily on hydropower and foreign grants, particularly from
India, which fluctuate considerably. When Tala came on-stream on 2006/07, for instance, it boosted
domestic revenues by 45 percent over 2005/06. On expenditures, fluctuations in recent years can be
attributed to the purchase of aircraft in 2004/05, interest payments for Tala (which started in 2007/08),
and an increase in discretionary capital expenditure in 2007/08 when the new government assumed office.
However, strong fiscal discipline has resulted in small fiscal surpluses during the last three years, and
2008/09 sees a surplus of 1.9 percent of GDP on account of under-spending on capital expenditures
(Figure 1).
15.
The stock of government debt rose from US$459 million in 2002/03 to US$721 million in
2008/09. This was largely on account of hydropower development loans. At the same time, RGoB’s
ability to service debt is also increasing due to a higher GDP contribution from the electricity sector. As
Tala came on-stream and boosted growth, the total debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 92.2 percent in 2005/06 to
59.6 percent in 2008/09 (Figure 1). Today, over 96 percent of total government debt is foreign, and about
60 percent is for hydropower development.
16.
Healthy external balances have led to continuous increases in foreign exchange reserves.
Large grants from India and foreign aid from Bhutan’s development partners have helped the country
maintain healthy external balances in recent years. The overall balance of payments has averaged around
6.5 percent of GDP over 2002/03-2008/09 on account of strong aid inflows, even as the current account
deficit has been in the range of about 10.8 percent of GDP over the same period. However, there has been
volatility, especially in the current account. For example, the current account deficit reached a high of 31
percent of GDP in 2004/05 when there were large imports due to RGoB’s purchase of aircraft. The
current account deficit has deteriorated in 2008/09 on account of increased imports from government
expenditure on hydropower projects, interest payments from Tala, and a decline in commodity exports
(particularly manufactured and mineral-based products) during the global economic crisis (Figure 1).
However, inflows on the capital account cover this. Foreign reserves have grown at about 12 percent
annually since 2002/03, and stand at over 13 months of import cover at present.
17.
Bhutan was adversely affected by several external shocks in 2009. These collectively caused
significant losses. First, floods resulting from Cyclone Aila in May cost the country an estimated US$15
million in damages to infrastructure. Second, an earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale struck
1

In the hydropower sector, the country has the potential to develop 23,760 MW of capacity, of which only five percent has been
tapped so far.

3

eastern Bhutan in September, and a rapid needs assessment estimated damages of about US$52 million,
also to existing infrastructure. Finally, even though Bhutan was largely insulated from the effects of the
recent global economic crisis, there was a significant effect on tourism. Convertible currency revenues
from the sector fell from US$38 million in 2008 to about US$31 million in 2009. While it is still too soon
to be conclusive, data from the Tourism Council of Bhutan suggests that the sector may be recovering.
Convertible currency earnings from tourism are higher in the first half of 2010 (US$14.3 million) than
they were in the first half of 2009 (US$13.5 million).

Economic Outlook

18.
Average annual real growth rate of 6.5 percent is expected during the CPS period.
Construction work on new hydropower projects will be the major source of growth during the CPS.2
Hydropower production will continue to drive economic growth in the medium term as RGoB proposes to
add 10,000 MW of hydropower generation capacity by 2020.3 During the CPS period, only the Dagachu
(114 MW) is expected to come on stream in 2012/13. Electricity and budgetary grants are the main
projected sources of revenue during the CPS period. The average share of electricity in aggregate revenue
is estimated to be about 28 percent during FY11-14. Grants are expected to account for over 37 percent of
Bhutan’s aggregate revenues during the CPS period. About 80 percent of these grants are expected to be
2

Construction work on the 1200 MW Punatsangchhu I, the 720 MW Mangdechhu, and the 1000 MW Punatsangchhu II
hydropower projects has already commenced, and they are targeted to become operational by 2017/18.
3
Bhutan and India have agreed on a list of 10 hydropower projects to be developed — six under an ‘intergovernmental model’ of
financing through a mix of grant and loan, and four under the joint venture model whereby public sector companies from both
countries will implement the project.

4

tied to specific projects. India alone accounts for almost 70 percent of projected grants. Bhutan’s tax base
is small, and efforts are planned to buttress collection from personal and business income taxes.
19.
Fiscal projections show an ability to withstand reasonable short-term shocks. Nonetheless,
there is a shortage of resources to finance the development agenda. Fiscal policy during the CPS period is
anchored in a prudent policy of maintaining current expenditures in-line with the domestic revenue stream
(Table 1). At the same time, the fiscal deficit projected by RGoB’s Budget Policy and Fiscal Framework
Statement (BPFFS) is expected to average above six percent, largely on account of the Royal
Government’s ambitious infrastructure expansion plans.
20.
Bhutan faces a resource shortage of about US$500 million in financing its projected
development plans during FY11-14. Capital expenditures rose significantly in 2009/10 as Bhutan
successfully hosted the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit in April
2010. Furthermore, the BPFFS assumes full implementation of planned reconstruction activities from the
recent earthquake and flooding damages of 2009. RGoB’s ambitious projections are based on a neardoubling of capital expenditure from 2008/09 levels, which may be constrained by capacity. More modest
growth in capital expenditure — at the historical rate of about ten percent per annum observed post-2001,
for example — will result in a lower fiscal deficit of about three percent of GDP during the 10FYP
period. The projected deficit also includes implementation of a civil service pay hike approved in early2009, which will contribute to higher current expenditure.
21.
The size of the total public debt is expected to rise, but the risk of debt distress is moderate.
Total debt burden is expected to rise. This is largely on account of external borrowing for the construction
of new hydropower projects, but the resources needed to service the debt will be generated directly by the
asset created through borrowing. The debt burden, which is presently close to 60 percent of GDP, is
projected to rise to almost 75 percent by 2013/14. A Joint IMF / World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA) undertaken in 2009 suggests moderate risk of debt distress over 2008/09–2028/29. While the
policy-related Low Income Country DSA (LIC-DSA) thresholds are breached for several indicators due
to debt on account of hydropower projects, these projects bring dividends in the form of growth and
exports. Sensitivity analyses show that the public debt profile is sustainable under most scenarios, and the
debt ratios decline over time and eventually fall below the LIC-DSA thresholds. Despite breach of
thresholds in the initial period of the analysis, a rating of moderate risk of debt distress is supported by: (i)
Bhutan’s strong track record of project implementation; (ii) commercial viability of new hydropower
projects; and (iii) Bhutan’s close economic and political ties with India which render minimal the
commercial risks of these projects, as India is both the main provider of financing for hydropower
projects as well as the main consumer of the projects’ output.
22.
The overall external balance will likely continue to show a surplus during the CPS period.
This is due to robust capital inflows, even as the current account deficit is projected to average about 5
percent. The current account deficit is expected to improve somewhat, with a deteriorating trade balance
and increased interest payments offset by higher current transfers. Electricity is expected to remain the
dominant export commodity, accounting for almost 50 percent of total exports, and India will likely
remain the key trading partner. Robust capital inflows in the form of capital transfers from India, foreign
direct investment (FDI), as well as loans and grants from development partners are expected to finance
the current account deficit and enable an increase in gross international reserves at the rate of 13.5 percent
per annum during FY11-14. The import cover is also projected to go up from 13 months at present to
over 22 months by 2013/14.
23.
There are several risks to Bhutan’s outlook. While Bhutan’s overall macroeconomic
framework is sound, as confirmed by the IMF’s 2009 Article IV Staff Report, its industrial and export
bases are narrow, and it is exposed to single market (India) and single commodity (hydropower) risks.

5

High spending pressures combined with the possible shortfalls in aid-based foreign financing, due to
weak global recovery, may lead to further debt build-up and jeopardize debt sustainability. Internally,
given high development spending to meet the goals of the 10FYP and recent wage increases, the fiscal
deficit has been rising. It is projected to rise further, creating overheating risks. Given its small size,
Bhutan will likely remain susceptible to economic volatility in external assistance and hydropower
revenues, and financing will be needed, along with fiscal prudence, to help maintain macroeconomic
targets.

Bhutan must manage its hydropower resources
to promote economic development effectively. RGoB
presently uses its revenues from hydropower to finance its
12000
budgetary expenditures, with the social sectors being
major areas for government spending. Projected high
10000
hydropower revenues during the CPS period and beyond
8000
will provide finance for growth, but may not necessarily
6000
spur sustained growth and employment in the nonhydropower sectors.4 Bhutan does not show resource

curse (‘Dutch Disease’) effects at present.5 At the same

time, it will be important to guard against manifestations

of this phenomenon in the future, especially as

hydropower development in Bhutan is largely dependent
on donor assistance and, therefore, subject to some
uncertainty. Using hydropower gains strategically, to facilitate the transition to a competitive, market-led
economy can be a good option for fostering non-hydropower growth and job creation. This would call for
part of hydropower revenues to be saved for stabilization purposes or for future generations, and using
these to purchase financial assets -- or reduce public debt -- that will provide a return for the economy.

B. Poverty and Human Development
25.
Poverty is declining and Bhutan does not face widespread hunger, destitution and
homelessness. The poverty headcount rate shows substantial reductions, falling from 31.7 percent in
2004 to 23.2 percent in 20076, with the official incidence of poverty being much lower in urban (1.7
percent) than in rural areas (30.9 percent). The urban-rural gap exists in other dimensions as well, for
example, food security, access to services and infrastructure. While rapidly urbanizing, Bhutan continues
to be over 60 percent rural. Difficulty of access has limited rural areas' access to social services which,
consequently, have progressed more slowly in the demographic transition. The result is that urban areas
have a profile of falling birth rates, an aging population, increasing chronic and costly non-communicable
diseases, increasing need for pensions, changing diet and declining levels of physical activity. Increased
access to ICT and higher levels of education overall have yielded demand for modern technologies, which
has important implications for government expenditure. In rural areas, on the other hand, people continue
to die at younger ages, have higher birth rates and are affected primarily by communicable diseases.
Addressing both realities at the same time and the financing pressures on that result necessitates a more
efficient use of funds and more innovative approaches.
26.
Bhutan is characterized by solid progress in human development and modernization,
particularly in urban areas, with increasing availability and use of public services throughout the country.
4

These potentially negative impacts on a resource-rich economy come through: (i) the appreciation of the real exchange rate, as
the export and production of the non-hydropower sector falls, which may lead to sectoral unemployment (hydropower employing
relatively few workers), while the price of non-traded goods increases; (ii) lack of domestic absorption capacity, as substantially
increased spending is made possible by the extra revenues from the taxation or ownership of the natural resource; (iii) weak
governance of public spending, where large amounts of new resource revenues entering the government budget can see poor
performance in terms of output, if the capacity to manage these resources is insufficient.
5
The real exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium with the Indian rupee. Hydropower revenues have India as the dominant and
stable market, which was not affected even during the global economic crisis. While youth unemployment is an issue, general
unemployment rates of around four percent compare favorably even with developed countries. In fact, the Investment Climate
Assessment Enterprise (ICA) Survey of 2010 shows that private formal firms in Bhutan are growing rapidly (although from a low
base), with the median firm reporting an increase of 36 percent in sales and 25 percent in employment over 2006-08.
6
It is to be noted that the national poverty line of Nu1,096 per person per month translates to about US$0.70 per person per day,
which is below the international benchmark of US$1 per person per day. Therefore, the poverty head count using the
international benchmark of US$1 per person per day is likely to be higher than 23.2 percent.

7

Bhutan received a score of 0.619 on the UNDP‘s Human Development Index in 2007, placing it in the
medium range, along with most of its neighboring South Asian countries.
Figure 3: Poverty Map
27.
Bhutan has already attained or is on-track
to achieve most of the MDGs. In education, the net
primary school enrollment and primary completion
rates are 92 percent and 90.2 percent, respectively
(2009)7; net enrollment in basic education (up to grade
10) is 75 percent. RGoB seeks to increase this to 90
percent by the end of the 10FYP. Bhutan has made
good progress in developing a system of national
education assessment, which is viewed by many other
countries as an example of good practice in this highly
technical area. In health, mortality rates of under-five
children were reduced by about half (from 123 to
61.5) between 1990 and 2007. Bhutan remains on
track to achieve the MDG target to reduce under-five
mortality by two-thirds. Infant mortality has also
decreased from 90 to 40.1 per 100,000 live births over
the period 1990-2007. The target of reducing it by two-thirds by 2015 appears feasible.
28.
Progress toward MDG targets has been slower to reach more remote areas. This is due to the
rugged terrain and limited trained human resources. While several MDG targets, such as increasing access
to safe drinking water and sanitation and a reduction in the proportion of under-weight children, have
already been achieved, the MDG on maternal
mortality, for example, is unlikely to be met.
Box 1: GNH and MDGs
Nevertheless, social development has been significant
overall, particularly given the difficult terrain and wide
“The pursuit of happiness in Bhutan has
population dispersion.

29.
Bhutan performs remarkably well in terms
of gender equality. Bhutanese culture fosters gender
equality, most significantly the tradition of passing
land and other forms of inheritance through daughters.
Women enjoy equal access to productive resources and
protection under the law. As a result, female labor
force participation is high in the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors combine. According to the Labor
Force Survey in 2009, the labor force participation rate
of women is almost as high as that of men (65 percent
vs. 73 percent), while the South Asia average of female
and male labor force participation rates are only 37
percent and 82 percent, respectively. In terms of
human development, the ratio of girls to boys in
primary and secondary school is as high as 98 percent
in 2008. However, when examining full time paid
employment in non-agricultural sectors, female

been, at the broadest level, a
concomitant effort to achieve four goals.
These are equitable and sustainable
socio-economic development,
conservation of our environment,
promotion of culture and good
governance. All our achievements
including, the peaceful emergence of
Bhutan as the youngest democracy has
been the result of pursuing happiness. I
wish to add also that the MDGs are
completely in harmony with our program
to create the enabling conditions for
happiness.”

participation drops significantly. Women represent only 14 percent of the workforce, and there are few
women holding high ranking positions in government and the private sector8. Only 10 out of 72 members
of Parliament are women and only one among 205 gups (village heads) is female. Such challenges
suggest the need for more innovative research, including gender-disaggregated data collection, in order to
understand the nature of glass ceiling phenomenon in Bhutan. Improved data collection is one of the areas
highlighted the 2010 High-Level Sensitization Program on Gender Mainstreaming recently conducted by
the National Commission for Women and Children (NCWC) for high-level government and parliament
officials, with support from UNDP.
30.
A number of worrisome social problems are emerging. With increased modernization and
urban drift, particularly among educated youth, there are rising juvenile problems, especially in Thimphu
and peri-urban settlements which are experiencing increasing rates of alcohol and drug abuse. There are
also alarming rates of domestic violence, much of which is attributed to widespread alcohol abuse. The
overall unemployment rate has risen to four percent from 3.7 percent in 2007. This translates to about
13,000 unemployed Bhutanese of which 81 percent are 15-24 years old. Youth unemployment has risen
rapidly to 13 percent from 9.9 percent in 2007 and 2.2 percent in 1998. Despite expansion of basic
education, the nation’s skills base is narrow and Bhutanese youth have insufficient exposure to practical
and applied studies that equip them with skills required for employment in expanding sectors. Similarly,
at the higher education level, many instructors lack qualifications and experience at advanced levels of
training and research, which presently constrains efforts to build a knowledge-based economy.
BHUTAN’S VISION, CHALLENGES AND STRATEGY
A.

Vision

31.
‘Gross National Happiness’ (GNH) is Bhutan’s overarching development philosophy. GNH
promotes a more meaningful purpose for national development than simply the fulfillment of material
satisfaction. This alternative development model places human happiness and holistic well-being at the
centre of the development equation. It highlights a consistent approach taken by the Royal Government to
secure a synergistic and harmonious balance between material well-being and the spiritual, emotional and
cultural needs of individuals and society. GNH aims to achieve broad-based and sustainable growth,
improvement in the quality of life, conservation of the natural environment, preservation of culture and
good governance. These themes have shaped the spirit and content of all five-year plans undertaken since
the inception of development activities in Bhutan.
32.
‘Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness’ is Bhutan’s twenty-year
perspective strategy. It sets the preferred direction for where Bhutan wants to be in the year 2020
starting from the base year of 2000. In striving to achieve increased GNH, Bhutan’s development goals
are reflected in Bhutan 2020. It envisions an economic future driven by hydropower-based investments to
help the country achieve financial self-reliance and with responsibility for development financing in its
own hands. To realize its vision for the delivery of quality services across the country, RGoB sees relying
not only on hydropower revenues, but also on a diversified economy which provides productive
employment for an educated and skilled populace. Based on these resources, Bhutan expects by 2020 to
be able to sustain rising social sector investments, meet its growing physical infrastructure development
requirements and stimulate further growth in economic activity to raise people’s standard of living and
quality of life. It also seeks to continue its policy of promoting high end-tourism, including eco-.

33.
The Royal Government further envisions the natural environment and natural resource
endowments being intact. It aims to maintain 60 percent of the country forested with sizeable tracts of
protected national parks and reserves harbouring rich bio-diversity. It anticipates the full development of
the country’s governance and legal institutions, with local governments which are fully and effectively
empowered and responsible for development planning and management. It is expected that the Bhutanese
people would genuinely own the development process toward fulfilling both long-term national goals and
local aspirations and priorities.
34.
Bhutan’s first elected government has expanded on the Bhutan 2020 vision. After coming
into office in 2008, while adhering to the vision articulated in Bhutan 2020, it has built upon this by
defining a long-term objective for the country to become a ‘knowledge-based society with ICT as the
platform, private sector as the engine for growth underscored by strategic infrastructure’. The
fulfillment of this vision constitutes the basis for the strategic choices of this CPS.
Box 2: Principles and Pillars of GNH
The 4th King of Bhutan, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, coined the term ‘Gross National Happiness’ in
1972 declaring it to be more important than gross domestic product. Since then, GNH has “influenced Bhutan’s
economic and social policy” (OPHI 2010) and generated much interest outside the country. The four key areas of
GNH are sustainable development, preservation of cultural values, conservation of the environment, and good
governance. (Thinley 2007)
In order to create a measurement tool “useful for policy making and resource
allocation,” (OPHI 2010) the GNH Index was launched in 2008.The GNH
Index is comprised of nine dimensions including conventional measures in
areas of health and education and less conventional measures including time
use, culture and psychological well-being. The results of the first GNH index
(2008) “showed that no surveyed Bhutanese person had achieved sufficiency
in all of the indicators; however, most Bhutanese people had achieved
sufficiency in six or more of the nine dimensions.” (OPHI 2010)
The usefulness of the GNH Index as a policy tool includes aspects of
Bhutan’s investment climate. For example, a business is able to increase
living standards, promote good governance, and can have implications on
employees’ psychological well-being.

The Nine Dimensions of the
GNH Index:
1) Psychological Well-Being
2) Cultural Diversity and
Resilience
3) Education
4) Health
5) Time Use
6) Good Governance
7) Community Vitality
8) Ecological Diversity and
Resilience
9) Living Standard

B.

Challenges

35.
Bhutan’s challenges to achieving its vision which the CPS seeks to address, fall into two
broad categories: (I) challenges to attaining economic growth for increased employment, and (II)
challenges to attaining improved standards of living and well-being.
I.

Challenges to attaining economic growth for employment

36.
Bhutan faces the challenge of growing and diversifying its economy to create employment. It
seeks to do this through expansion of the private sector while, at the same time, equipping its people with
the skills and knowledge needed to enter an expanding and diversifying job market. While RGoB
recognizes that opportunities for employment must be found in the private sector and successful
diversification of the economy, a number of factors impede private sector development in Bhutan. The

10

World Bank Group’s Doing Business report (2010) and Investment Climate Assessment (ICA, 2010)
identify several such constraints.
37.
Bhutan ranks 126th out of 183 countries on the ease of starting a business.9 Licensing is
time-consuming and bureaucratic. The time spent by firms to comply with government regulations and
the associated costs are much higher compared to regional and international averages. Bhutan’s business
environment would benefit from simplification of regulatory and licensing procedures. Payment systems
have not modernized, leading to heavy use of cash and paper based transactions. The ICA highlighted that
with a 312 percent collateral principal ratio, the value of collateral needed for a bank loan is close to the
highest in the world. More than 20 percent of surveyed firms listed access to finance as the main obstacle
to business, mostly for small and medium firms. Equally, more than 20 percent of firms list skills issues
or labor regulations as the main impediment. Not surprisingly, given Bhutan’s landlocked geography,
transportation tops infrastructure/access to markets constraints for large firms, in particular. These
constraining factors are coupled with a small domestic market, high transport costs and inadequate
infrastructure, including roads and electricity.
38.
Bhutan's economy remains led by state-owned enterprises. While the private sector has been
growing, public companies are the largest companies as measured by assets, turnover and employment.
However, a number are loss-making and operate under governance rules that diverge from international
best practice. The creation in 2007 of Druk Holdings and Investment (DHI), the primary ownership entity
for state owned enterprises in Bhutan, is a promising step toward improving corporate governance for the
state-owned sector. DHI would benefit, however, from the instituting of international corporate
governance standards.
39.
RGoB has recently revised its policy frameworks governing both private sector
development and foreign direct investment. It has also embarked upon a far-reaching reform exercise
with the support of a renowned international management consulting firm to boost economic development
and employment generation. This includes planned major reform of the tertiary education sub-sector to
increase access to and relevance of learning programs, increasing the skills base through training and
apprenticeships for youth, and increasing private sector participation in the delivery of basic services,
including health, education and infrastructure.
40.
The ICA explicitly addressed the gender issue and found a mixed picture for women in business
in Bhutan. Finance appears a more acute constraint for women entrepreneurs.

Capacity is a major issue constraining the RGoB‘s development efforts. Although Bhutan has
made rapid strides in the field of education and human resource development, much work remains before
the nation is equipped with the human resources required to sustain the process of development. The
nation’s skills base is extremely limited and just over one-half of the population is considered literate and
numerate. It should be noted, however, that gains in literacy and educational attainment are largely
generational and reflect progress made over the last two decades. In addition to technical capacity at the
lower and mid-levels, middle and high-level managerial capacity is in short supply and a lack of
procurement and financial management capacity among civil servants has been a particular impediment
for the implementation of the Royal Government’s development agenda.
42.
The number of people completing schooling and seeking employment is growing rapidly.
Over the decade 2001 to 2010, it was projected that approximately 90,000 school leavers and graduates
would be produced by the school system with exponential increases taking place each year. As the current
formal sector work force is estimated around 60,000, the creation of an additional 90,000 jobs is a
formidable challenge. There exists, however, reluctance on the part of young people to enter the private
sector. This has several reasons. They fail to see real growth within the sector, are dubious of career
prospects and fear job insecurity. Unlike many other developing countries, wage differentials between the
public and private sectors are modest, except at the highest levels. Negative perceptions are not
effectively countered by higher rates of pay and other financial incentives. This has led to underutilization of capacity in technical and vocational training institutions, which the country can ill afford.
These factors also constitute a major obstacle to the growth of the private sector. A key challenge moving
forward will be to create and implement a credible strategy for private sector development which builds
people’s confidence in the private sector as a viable career path.
II.

Challenges to attaining improved living standards and well-being

43.
Poverty continues to impact approximately one-fifth of the population. This is the case
despite the fact that over the past 30 years Bhutan has made remarkable progress in improving the overall
living standard of its people through improved access to services and decreasing poverty levels. Bhutan’s
increasingly educated population and relatively new system of democratic governance, whereby elected
officials seek to respond to constituents’ demands, places enormous pressure on RGoB to expand access
to quality public services and infrastructure in both rural and urban areas.
44.
Bhutan’s social and economic transition over the last two decades has fueled rapid
urbanization. This is despite efforts to increase the availability of rural infrastructure -- particularly roads
and electricity -- to make rural areas more attractive. This rapidly changing demographic reality
characterized by urban drift is a major challenge. With increasing levels of rural-urban migration,
growing urban populations require municipal services such as roads, sewerage, water and solid waste
disposal in the face of limited financial, human and institutional resources to plan for and manage the
growth of towns and cities. Bhutan’s urban population is projected to grow from approximately 30 to 50
percent by 2020 and is estimated to have grown by 4.7 percent per year over the past ten years. This rapid
urban growth is generating a host of major infrastructure challenges. The capital city, Thimphu, presents
some of the most pressing urban challenges for the country and the Royal Government has been
struggling to manage its rapid expansion toward ensuring that underdeveloped areas are provided with
essential urban services and infrastructure. A factor negatively impacting urban development in Bhutan is
an insufficient capacity for urban planning and management. Finally, there is a lack of clear identification
of the potential role of the private sector through public-private partnerships.
45.
Underdeveloped infrastructure constrains the delivery of public services as well as private
sector growth. Access remains a problem in remote areas, in particular. Despite the rapid expansion of
the road network, more than 50 percent of the population lives half-a-day‘s walk from the nearest

12

motorable road. In addition to the existing system of national highways which traverses the country eastto-west with four branches extending to the southern border with India, the country’s network of feeder
and farm roads serving remote villages throughout the country is expanding. However, the geophysical
reality of Bhutan’s terrain within the relatively young and unstable Himalayan mountain range makes
road construction and maintenance difficult, particularly with the occurrence of frequent landslides
provoked by annual monsoon rains.
46.
In rural areas, agricultural production systems and rural living standards are influenced
heavily by Bhutan’s mountainous landscape, sparse population and limited physical infrastructure.
Subsistence agriculture, low levels of monetization and high rates of poverty prevail in areas where access
is limited to walking tracks and the nearest road or town is more than four hours walk away. Access to
public services is also limited in some remote areas. Labor shortages have emerged as a major constraint
to agricultural growth and there is a possibility that enhanced non-farm employment opportunities will
both exacerbate this shortage and raise the cost of farm labour. Where access is poor, rural poverty is high
and subsistence agriculture prevails. Access to agricultural extension and farm inputs are known to be
weak in such areas. There is a need to strengthen links between rural communities and adjacent rural
markets, as well as bring greater diversification of agricultural products.
47.
The geographical ‘isolated community’ nature of rural Bhutan also poses several
challenges. This was clearly witnessed following the 2009 September earthquake – both in terms of
communications and building standards. While RGoB is trying to strengthen rural linkages, there is a
need for better emergency communications and strengthening of local communities and government for
being prepared, through equipment and training to better respond to disasters such as earthquakes and
landslides. A lack of safe and strong housing and inadequate seismic-safe building codes in rural areas are
major impediments to household well-being in the face of natural disasters.
48.
The continued expansion of basic services and addressing the emerging challenges will
continue to put pressure on public resources. The challenge, therefore, is to increase efficiency and
effectiveness in the use of public resources and skillfully involve the private and/or civil society in the
delivery of basic services, when appropriate and possible.
C.

The Royal Government’s Strategy

49.
The Royal Government’s strategy to attain its vision for Bhutan’s future development is
reflected in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10FYP). This describes the country’s development programs
and activities for the current five-year plan period (FY08-13) and serves as RGoB’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). The overall development objective of the 10FYP is poverty reduction. This is
expected to be realized through implementing the following strategic priorities: (i) vitalize industry; (ii)
strengthen national spatial planning; (iii) achieve synergized rural-urban development; (iv) expand
strategic infrastructure; (v) invest in human capital; and (vi) foster an enabling environment through good
governance. To sustain a target real growth rate of 7.7 percent over the medium-term, RGoB sees its
major sources of growth as construction, electricity, transport and communications.
50.
The overarching target of the 10FYP is to decrease the poverty headcount to 15 percent by
2013. Block transfers from the central government to district and sub-district governments have been
introduced based on poverty estimates, population and geographical size at the sub-district level. The
Royal Government is working to produce poverty estimates at the sub-district level, presented as poverty
maps, and strengthen and rationalize decentralized resource allocation and management. Poverty mapping
has been supported with technical assistance from the World Bank.

13

51.
RGoB’s strategy prioritizes expansion of the private sector and use of ICT. These are
expected to bring the country increased economic diversification, growth and employment. To support
this agenda, the Royal Government issued in 2010 two key policy frameworks as the core of its economic
development strategy: (I) Economic Development Policy; and (II) Foreign Direct Investment Policy.
RGoB is also preparing ambitious plans for enhancing the system of skills development, training and
tertiary education. Combined, these measures aim to spur private sector growth for increased and
diversified employment opportunities, facilitate technology transfer and increase foreign revenue
earnings.
52.
Development of the 10FYP was carried out through extensive consultations with the people.
This participatory process started soon after completion of the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the 9FYP in
2005. Following extensive deliberations and consultations with various stakeholders, including
communities, civil society, private sector and local governments across the country, a preliminary set of
guidelines were drawn up that contained the core objectives, priorities, strategies and resource allocation
principles for the plan. These policy guidelines also incorporated recommendations of both the MTR and
the ‘Good Governance Plus’ report of 2005. Guidelines for preparation of the 10FYP were subsequently
circulated to all ministries, agencies, dzongkhags (districts), and geogs (sub-districts) as a broad policy
framework for the formulation of plan programs. The aggregate plan was based on a consolidation of
dzongkhag plans and finalized in January 2009.
Box 3: RGOB’s Strategy Development and Consultative Process
Bhutan’s PRSP reflects the country’s long tradition of participatory planning. The 10FYP
(2008/09 to 2012/13) is based on a consultative process that started soon after the completion
of the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the 9FYP in 2005. The preparation process involved
extensive consultations with stakeholders, including the private sector and local
government bodies (dzongkhags and gewogs), and reflected the recommendations of the
MTRand the Good Governance Plus Report of 2005. The resulting Plan is based on a
consolidation of individual dzongkhag plans, and was approved by Parliament in January
2009.
Bhutan Joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, March 29, 2009

WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
A.

Lessons from the Last Country Assistance Strategy

53.
The 2010 Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) finds that the CAS for
FY06-09 effectively aligned itself with the goals and priorities of the 9FYP in its focus on three pillars: (i)
expanding access to better infrastructure and social services and connecting communities to markets; (ii)
promoting private sector development and employment; and (iii) strengthening management of public
resources, and the monitoring and evaluation of development outcomes. These were all identified by the
CASCR as appropriate and well-targeted areas of intervention for the Bank during the last CAS period.
54.
There are three broad lessons from the last CAS. The first concerns the needed selectivity in
the program to avoid being spread thinly across sectors and areas of engagement. With a small IDA
envelop, the selective use of IDA resources for specific investments must be well targeted to ensure
maximum impact and added value, particularly in terms of knowledge and technical support. A second

14

key lesson concerns capacity as a major issue constraining the Royal Government’s reform efforts. The
CASCR notes that progress was strongest where adequate capacity either already existed, or was
mobilized as a part of deepening engagement in a given area. The strengthening of Bhutan’s procurement
system, which is now being reviewed and further bolstered as part of a Use of Country Systems (UCS)
agenda, is a good example of where close engagement over a sufficient amount of time has yielded strong
results. A third lesson of the last CAS period concerns coordination, both within the Royal Government
for improved monitoring and evaluation of Bank-supported activities, as well as within the World Bank
Group to ensure complementarity between the Bank and IFC and among Bank teams. The CASCR notes
that at the sectoral level coordination among ministries and agencies remains a challenge, particularly
around monitoring and evaluation. While there are obvious sector specific issues to be addressed, national
planning and monitoring would benefit from the standardization of a number of indicators across sectors.
55.
Bank and IFC teams worked collaboratively to support development of the private sector.
This included joint analytical work to carry out an investment climate assessment and final review of the
EDP and FDI Policies. Knowledge sharing across World Bank Group teams on the results of the first
poverty mapping exercise was also coordinated. This aimed to enhance understanding of poverty among
all stakeholders and engage government more meaningfully on issues and strategies related to poverty in
the context of increased decentralization of resource allocation.
B.

Proposed Partnership Strategy

56.
The FY11–14 CPS seeks to assist the Royal Government in addressing a period of major
transition for the country. It focuses on economic growth, employment generation and skills
development, while supporting the expansion and sustainability of quality public services. As this is a
joint Bank-IFC CPS, it aims to ensure maximum complimentarity and collaboration between both
agencies for providing a consolidated package of inputs by way of both financing and knowledge sharing.
The World Bank Group’s partnership with Bhutan is demand-driven, closely aligned with the Royal
Government’s own planning and vision, and is founded on a strong relationship built-up over many years.
57.
The CPS is guided by three principles: (i) alignment with government strategic priorities; (ii)
partnership; and (iii) selectivity. These principles are based on lessons learned from the last CAS and
through feedback gained during broad-based consultations with the Royal Government, civil society,
private sector and other development partners.
58.
Alignment with government strategic priorities. The CPS is aligned with three key strategic
frameworks: (i) principles of GNH; (ii) Bhutan’s 2020 Vision; and (iii) the Tenth Five-Year Plan.
Drawing upon each, the CPS seeks to support Bhutan in fulfilling the aspirations and goals which each of
these frameworks sets out, and respond to emerging priority areas. It reflects the Royal Government’s
priorities as revealed during the CPS consultation process. While the CPS aims to define the broad
program over the CPS period, it also recognizes the reality of changing priorities and envisages some
degree of flexibility to address the complexity of the current challenges and the need to adjust to changing
circumstances.
59.
Partnership. This CPS reflects three key partnerships: (a) between the World Bank Group and the
Royal Government of Bhutan; (b) between the World Bank Group and other key stakeholders, including
private sector, civil society and other development partners; and (c) between the Bank and IFC.
60.
The World Bank Group is seen as an important development partner for Bhutan. It is
valued for both its financial and technical support. RGoB has solicited the World Bank Group’s advice
and input in a number of areas, particularly related to improving the investment climate for private sector
development, as well as options for the sustainability of public provision of social services and the long-

15

term management of hydropower revenues for sustained growth. IDA development policy lending to
Bhutan demonstrates the Bank’s confidence in RGoB to plan and manage its development agenda, and is
a reflection of the country’s solid track record for ensuring good governance. This is further underscored
by incremental steps toward the use of country systems for procurement, financial management and
environmental safeguards. Both reflect a level of trust and shared vision which characterizes the
partnership.
61.
The CPS also reflects the World Bank Group’s close partnership with other stakeholders.
IFC’s on-going dialogue with the private sector is central to the on-going development of the IFC
program in Bhutan. The Bank engages regularly with civil society and during the CPS period will
continue to support Bhutan’s emerging NGO/civil society sector. There is a relatively small number
bilateral and multilateral development partners with resident offices in Bhutan. With the opening of a
World Bank Group office in Thimphu, existing practices for development partner information sharing and
coordination are expected to be further strengthened. The response to the September 2009 earthquake in
eastern Bhutan underscored, for example, the importance of close partnerships between Bank, other
development partners and the Royal Government. Finally, the World Bank Group will seek to leverage
other donor resources to support achieving results in areas of shared interest and mutuality vis-à-vis
programming.
62.
The CPS reflects a strong partnership of the World Bank and IFC. It strategically positions
both agencies to work together to support Bhutan in achieving its development goals. The establishment
of a shared country office in Thimphu at the start of the CPS period aims to foster closer collaboration
between the World Bank and IFC, as well as ensure greater coordination and engagement in dialogue
with the Royal Government and other stakeholders, including central and local administrations, private
sector, civil society and communities, among others.
63.
Selectivity. The CPS strives to be selective in the number of lending operations, choice of lending
instruments, and sectors of engagement it identifies, particularly given IDA’s small allocation relative to
Bhutan’s overall needs. The CPS envisages both programmatic development policy lending to address
broader issues of policy and provide government with flexibility to utilize resources as it sees fit in-line
with national development plans. It also envisages specific investments for projects where the Bank’s
earlier support for institution and capacity building will help consolidate achievements to enhance
sustainability. The CPS also identifies emerging priority areas, such as skills and training to address the
skills/labour market mismatch hindering youth employment.
64.
Selectivity will also be reflected in the Bank and IFC advisory and analytic programs. These
will be used to strategically underpin both budget support and lending operations, as well as support
IFC’s portfolio development in strategic areas of interest. These programs will reflect the Bank and IFC’s
capacity to provide knowledge sharing in areas of respective expertise outside of where lending is
programmed. Given the small size of Bhutan’s IDA envelop, that most financing will be provided through
budget support operations, and the relative newness of IFC’s presence in Bhutan, the World Bank
Group’s capacity to share knowledge across sectors will, in many ways, constitute the cornerstone of
engagement in a given sector or area.
C.

Results Framework

65.
The CPS emphasizes both economic/material growth and people’s overall well-being. In
doing so, it reflects Bhutan’s ‘Gross National Happiness’ development philosophy which emphasizes
both economic/material growth and the well-being of individuals, communities and society.

16

Figure 4: CPS areas of engagement, results clusters, and potential impact of the Bank’s program

66.

The CPS’ results framework is organized into two areas of engagement.
A. Economic Diversification, Job Creation and Financial Inclusion
B. Spatial Planning and Public Services

The CPS recognizes that economic growth must be accompanied by sustained efforts toward ensuring that
all members of society benefit from quality infrastructure and services, tailored to the specific needs of
both urban and rural populations, while simultaneously ensuring that the country’s remarkable gains in
the social sectors of health and education continue apace. To achieve these results, the CPS draws on the
comparative strengths and advantages of the Bank and IFC, and ensures full alignment with the country’s
Tenth Five-Year Plan and Bhutan 2020 vision.
67.
The CPS will support Bhutan in unleashing potential for private sector growth. This will be
achieved through a focus on improving the business environment for FDI and domestic investment in the
private sector, particularly through local entrepreneurship development. A key outcome of growth of the
private sector will be the creation of employment opportunities, particularly for youth who possess
relevant knowledge and skills for the job market.
68.
The CPS will also assist in ensuring the adequate provision of basic infrastructure. This goal
targets both growing urban populations, as well as rural dwellers for increased access as a means of
improving rural living standards and to stem urban drift. The CPS will assist in prioritizing budget
spending and increasing public sector efficiency to avoid any major negative impacts of fiscal
adjustments on critical public services and longer-term growth.
69.
Outcomes in the two areas of engagement are expected to reinforce and complement each
other. This propounds a balanced view of development which is consistent with Bhutan’s Buddhist

17

philosophy of a ‘middle path’. Thus, the outcomes under the CPS support the country in consolidating
past gains, completing prior agendas, especially for ensuring access for all to basic services, while
simultaneously beginning to set the basis for a new economy able to face the many complexities of a
rapidly changing world with increasing globalization and interconnectedness that dissolves, in many
respects, traditional boarders – which in the past helped foster Bhutan’s isolation. Together these areas of
engagement will help establish the foundations needed to move Bhutan closer toward creating a
knowledge-based society while, at the same time, fulfilling the long-term goals articulated in the Bhutan
2020 vision.
70.
The World Bank Group will focus on achievements considered critical for Bhutan’s longterm vision. Given the difficult nature of the transformation through which Bhutan is moving, the
attainment of visible results will take time. Therefore, the focus will be on achieving specific modest
outcomes in key strategic areas which can then be built upon. Choice of lending instruments and types of
advisory and analytical work to be undertaken will be based on how they best support the achievement of
results.
71.
Cross-cutting themes. The CPS identifies two cross-cutting themes embedded throughout the
program:
(a) Capacity building for good governance
(b) Environmental sustainability
72.
Capacity building for good governance. This theme encapsulates both institutional and human
resource capacity building on the premise that good governance is largely the outcome of institutions and
individuals’ capacity to perform. It acknowledges the central role of capacity building for implementing
development plans efficiently and effectively. Strengthening already sound public financial management
(PFM) is an area of high priority for Bhutan and the CPS. This is consistent with the country’s good
governance agenda, and since RGoB is the major controller of public resources, with grants and
hydropower revenues flowing through it.
73.
Environmental sustainability. This cross-cutting theme includes environmental stewardship and
the application of environmental safeguards, disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change.
Environmental stewardship is achieved primarily through the application of RGoB’s own environmental
safeguards. The CPS includes specific disaster risk reduction activities, as well as imbues disaster risk
reduction approaches throughout the program, particularly for the provision of infrastructure. The CPS
considers climate change a cross-sectoral issue, and accounts for climate resilience through how the
anticipated investments can contribute to enhancing the country’s preparedness to cope with climate
change.
Area of Engagement A: Economic Diversification, Job Creation and Financial Inclusion
74.
The CPS supports the objective of the Royal Government to diversify the economy thus
increasing opportunities for meaningful employment and entrepreneurship. To do so, the CPS
program assists the Royal Government in implementing a program that removes barriers to business
creation and operation and fosters financial inclusion and greater financial sophistication of the economy.
The improved business environment is expected to lead to the creation of greater employment and income
opportunities. In addition, the CPS program will assist Bhutan in equipping key segments of the
population with the knowledge and skills that fulfill the needs of an expanding private sector. The parallel
focus on the demand for quality employment and supply of adequate skills will enhance the credibility of
the strategy, which is a weak point today. A growing and robust private sector that leads the
diversification of the economy and demands new knowledge and skills from those entering the workforce
will set the stage for Bhutan to advance toward a knowledge-based economy.

18

Private Sector Development
75.
The World Bank Group’s engagement is in many ways grounded in the results of the
recently completed Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) report. It is further supported by the
dialogue with authorities during its preparation. It aims to assist Bhutan in improving the investment
climate to encourage both domestic and foreign investment in private sector enterprises, leverage private
sector involvement in the provision of strategic infrastructure, including through public-private
partnerships, and support financial inclusion through enhanced efficiency of and access to financial
services. This includes improving accounting and auditing standards in the private sector. Lastly, it aims
to strengthen corporate governance in light of the prominent role in the economy of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs).
Results Cluster 1: Private Sector Development
Long-term objectives
Improved environment for
private sector investment

Leveraging private sector

Results/outcomes at end of fiscal 2014
 Improved framework of policies, procedures and practices resulting in more
efficient process of business start-up, project approval and licensing for
domestic and foreign investors
 Increase in the number of FDI project approvals
 Increased number of public private partnerships
 Increased ratio of private credit over GDP
 Improved corporate governance for SOEs as measured by the number of SOEs
implementing new Corporate Governance framework

76.
Improved environment for private sector investment. To advance RGoB’s agenda for reforming
policy and regulatory frameworks for private sector growth, the CPS will support revised FDI rules and
regulations in-line with the recently completed FDI Policy. It will support the drafting and launch of an
implementation plan for the Economic Development Policy to operationalize critical measures set out in
the policy to expand private sector participation. It will support accounting and audit reforms, including
the notification and implementation of new accounting standards. Improvements in the business
environment, licensing simplification, and the capacity of small and medium-size enterprises will be
achieved through the on-going Bhutan Private Sector Development Project and a follow-on project. The
Development Policy Credit series will support key policy and institutional reforms for strengthening the
investment climate and streamlining regulatory requirements and procedures. IFC’s second-phase support
for business licensing simplification through the South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) will
aim to reduce barriers to setting up a company, trading across borders, accessing land, and protecting
investors, via system-wide reforms, such as e-License Portal. These results will be provided through a
mix of lending for specific investments and AAA, including technical assistance for licensing
simplification and possible IFC support for small and medium enterprise finance.
77.
Leveraging private sector participation for strategic infrastructure. The CPS will support
through technical assistance and the development policy operation series the possible need and use of a
Public Private Partnership (PPP) unit in government to build government’s capability to facilitate and
build sustainable PPPs. IFC is discussing possible advisory support for private sector involvement in bus
services and solid waste management in Thimphu, as well as exploring possible investment assistance for
increasing private sector participation in the ICT, hydropower, transport (airlines) and tourism sectors. In
the bus services and solid waste management PPP projects, the Bank, through on-going or planned urban

19

development investments, and IFC will explore joint or complementary support for supporting Bhutan’s
infrastructure development.
78.
Improved efficiency of and access to financial services. Building on the diagnostic study jointly
conducted by the Bank and IFC, the CPS will support the modernization of payment systems in Bhutan.
This should lead to a fully functioning Electronic Funds Transfer Clearing System (EFTCS) stimulating
commercial and financial transactions and reducing costs of cash and checks. In addition, it will support
modernization of lending practices and increased financial literacy in the country through a follow-on
private sector development project, the development policy operations series and targeted AAA. IFC is
exploring possible support through both investment and advisory services to expand the availability of
financial services, including payments and leasing for MSMEs.
79.
Strengthened corporate governance of state-owned enterprises. The CPS will support technical
assistance to improve corporate governance among state-owned enterprises (SOEs), specifically the
development of good governance practices and improvement of transparency, effectiveness in governance
and accountability. This support may be enhanced by further WBG assistance with DHI’s

divestiture review and plan.
80.
Under this cluster, the program will support institutional strengthening. This will be done to
enhance good governance and capacity building across relevant agencies and private sector institutions,
such as banks. On-going technical assistance through the DPC series will support institutional
strengthening for the planning and use of hydropower revenues. To support environmental sustainability,
the leveraging of private sector participation for strategic infrastructure will promote the provision of
infrastructure which is resilient to natural disasters, particularly for ensuring seismic resistance, and built
according to Bhutan’s well defined environmental safeguards framework.
i.

Employment and Skills Development

81.
On the supply side of increasing employment, the CPS will support RGoB’s efforts to
diversify training options, particularly for educated youth and women. This will be carried out as a
means of assisting Bhutan in equipping key segments of the population with knowledge and skills to
improve labour market insertion and address the mismatch between skills demand and skills availability.
It will also promote the delivery of training and skills programs in partnership with the private sector.
Results Cluster 2: Employment and Skills Development
Long-term objectives
Results/outcomes at end of fiscal 2014
Diversify learning options to meet skills  Competency-based curricula in place as measured by
demand and enhance employability through:
number of new or revised learning offerings
(a) increasing access to and choice of learning  Increased annual number of graduates trained in
options, and (b) increasing private sector
institutions through public private partnerships (e.g.
participation.
tourism, ICT, nursing)
 Increased number of firms providing apprenticeships for
Bhutanese youth

82.
The CPS will support improvements in the quality of technical and vocational education
and training (TVET). This will be achieved through the development of competency-based curricula and
expansion of subjects. Particular attention will be paid to the training and skills development needs of
women as a means of addressing lags in the participation of women in the formal manufacturing and
services workforce. It will help establish links between the university and TVET education systems by

20

making it possible for experienced and well-trained graduates from the technical and vocation stream to
access tertiary education as a part of life-long learning.
83.
The CPS will support an increased emphasis on public private partnerships for
employability by fostering private sector-based training in expanding sectors. It will explore
opportunities to train job seekers directly in private sector firms by providing incentives such as financing
of training and establishing apprenticeship programs. It will also support improvements in labor market
regulations and intermediation through improved services for job placement. This will include
intermediary services for helping job seekers be better prepared for the growing job market, gain more
experience in the private sector, as well as have timely and relevant information about learning and job
opportunities.
84.
A mix of lending and analytical work will support the achievement of results under this
cluster. Through the on-going Private Sector Development Project, Bhutanese youth are receiving IT
training in India for subsequent absorption in Bhutan’s emerging IT industry. A follow-on specific
investment for private sector development and creating of a knowledge society will include activities for
expanding training and skills development opportunities. IFC’s investment support for the ICT sector
would complement the Bank’s efforts, particularly if investments are realized. Technical assistance for
promoting e-Government is also expected to help broaden employment opportunities arising from the
introduction and functioning of e-Government systems. A rural livelihoods project will include activities
to support the availability of skills training in rural areas for expanding and diversifying agriculture sector
as well as non-farm employment. The development policy series will support policy and institutional
reforms aimed at facilitating productive employment opportunities.
85.
Institutional capacity building within the Royal Government to improve the management of
training and skills development programs will be a key aspect of interventions under this cluster.
Similarly, human resource development in the critical areas of labour market analysis, employment
forecasting and the design and management of skills development program, including through publicprivate partnerships, will be instrumental. In-line with Bhutan’s strong track record for environmental
stewardship, lending for specific investments will undergo thorough screening for ensuring the
application of environmental safeguards and standards.
Area of Engagement B: Spatial Planning and Public Services
86.
The CPS aims to assist the Royal Government to deliver quality social services, enhance
access to them and address challenges emerging from Bhutan’s own previous success, such as
rapidly increasing rural to urban migration. This area of engagement is closely aligned to RGoB’s
objective of increasing the availability of quality services throughout the country, including to businesses.
The CPS focuses on extending public services to areas that lack them, mostly in rural areas of difficult
access and in those urban areas where increasing numbers of people are settling in. This seeks to address
dual demands posed by the Royal Government’s long-standing commitment to increasing access to
essential services, including roads, water supply, health and education facilities and electricity, while
addressing new challenges posed by shifting demographics, particularly urbanization, and rising public
expectations. It will help consolidate and complete what has been an ambitious agenda for a country that
just 30 years ago was largely cut off from the outside world and whose population was largely confined to
their own regions as a function of its rugged terrain. It also aims to improve effectiveness and efficiency
in the delivery of services, particularly in the human development sectors. It complements the first area of
engagement by supporting measures to raise incomes and promote economic diversification in rural areas
beyond subsistence agriculture.

21

Sustainable Urban-Rural Development
87.
The CPS emphasizes the provision of infrastructure and institution building as first steps in
a broader strategy to bring outcomes to isolated and underserved populations. To address shifting
demographics with an increasing proportion of the population living in urban areas which lacks sufficient
infrastructure, including water, sewerage and transport facilities, the CPS will support the provision of
urban infrastructure and capacity building for municipal authorities to better plan, manage finances and
deliver services. In rural areas, this results cluster seeks to increase rural living standards by increasing
incomes derived from both farm and non-farm activities and employment. The CPS will also address
disaster risk reduction under this cluster, recognizing the importance of safe and disaster resilient
infrastructure in both urban and rural settings, and the importance of community-based activities for
disaster risk reduction, disaster preparedness and adaptation to climate change.

88.
Urban Development. The urban population is estimated to continue to rise during the CPS period.
The CPS will support RGoB through the Second Bhutan Urban Development Project (BUDP2) under
which the Thimphu City Corporation (TCC) will develop sites and services for two local area plans. This
will lead to improved access to roads, street lights, drainage, sewerage and water supply for residents of
each area. To strengthen this effort, IFC is looking to work jointly with the Bank as part of this program
to assist TCC with a public-private partnership scheme for solid waste management. In parallel, the Bank
will support improvements in municipal management and municipal finance systems in the city
corporations of Thimphu and Phuntsholing, including the computerization of municipal accounts and tax
records, and training for staff at the city corporations and Ministry of Works and Human Settlement.
89.
The municipal reform and capacity building components of the BUDP2 will help with the
establishment of urban local governments with enhanced autonomy and accountability for planning,
staffing, finance and budgeting. A follow-on urban development project toward the end of the CPS period
will address infrastructure and capacity building in dzongkhag towns or underserved parts of Bhutan’s
two major cities, Thimphu and Phuntsholing. AAA to examine trends in urbanization will enhance
understanding of the linkages between urbanization and employment and identify priority areas of future
investment. These initiatives could further be complemented by IFC’s PPP advisory support for Thimphu

22

City bus services to provide better public mass transit services and possibly reduce fiscal burden on
RGoB.
90.
Rural Development. The CPS will initially support rural development through analytical work
for the preparation of a national rural development policy, which will help operationalize RGoB’s vision
for sustaining and improving rural livelihoods. It will inform strategic decision-making for integrating
competing demands for economic activity, employment, services and opportunities for education and
skills development. A specific investment to support rural development will build on strategic directions
identified by analytical work and consolidate gains made under on-going rural development programs
supported by IDA, other development partners and RGoB.
91.
A new investment project will continue expansion of the network of rural roads, as well as
support public and private measures to enhance agricultural productivity and strengthen the marketing of
new and existing agriculture commodities. The project will encourage economic diversification led by the
private sector, and seek to expand opportunities for rural livelihoods through increased farm and non-farm
employment, improved application of technologies and market information systems, skills training and
entrepreneurship. Project design will be influenced by the results of on-going poverty mapping work, an
urbanization and growth study, a youth employment study, and the public expenditure review for the
social sectors. It will provide key pieces of information to inform parallel studies on urbanization and
employment. The development policy operation series can pick up any relevant policy reforms.
92.
Building on the ongoing advisory activities to promote credit access for the underserved, IFC is
considering an access to finance advisory program to increase the availability of credits, especially for
agribusiness financing in the rural areas. IFC plans to complement this with potential SME financing or
leasing support, which would include rural or agribusiness dimensions. IFC is evaluating opportunities to
support agribusiness projects with multiple benefits to Bhutan, such as niche products with export
potential which could bring positive effects to supplying farmers, as well as support diversified tourism
activities. IFC and the Association of Bhutan Women Entrepreneurs successful and scaled-up initiative
that introduced commercial agriculture to women in remote villages may be replicated.
93.
Disaster Management. Under this results cluster, the Bank is leveraging technical assistance
funds from other sources, including a Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant to support the
Community-Based Disaster Risk Management and adaptation to climate change. Global Facility for
Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR) funds will be used to provide support to the disaster risk management
components in RGoB‘s program more broadly. Development policy operations address institutional
strengthening for disaster risk reduction through the development of a multi-hazard atlas and macro-level
hazard risk assessment. Additionally, policy reform measures support development of a National
Emergency Operations Center and a National Disaster Response Plan to strengthen overall response and
coordination capacities in the event of a disaster.
94.
Institutional and human resource capacity building are embedded in activities under this
cluster. Strengthening the institutional capacity of municipal governments forms an essential component
for meeting objectives for improved quality of life in urban settings. In the rural sector, activities to
support non-farm employment for increased and diversified economic activity and enhance the
availability of non-farm skills will help prepare rural dwellers, particularly youth, enter the labour market.
The provision of infrastructure in urban and rural settings will be carried out in an environmentally
sensitive manner in compliance with RGoB’s own environmental safeguards. Particular attention will be
paid to ensuring maximum disaster resilience. The September 2009 earthquake revealed the need for rural
infrastructure to incorporate improved building codes for increased seismic resistance.

ii.

Access to Quality Public Services

95.
The CPS will support RGoB’s efforts to increase the efficiency and equitable delivery of
services, particularly in the social sectors. Over the last three national plan periods, RGoB has
prioritized health and education in its budget, allocating close to 25 percent to these sectors. As Bhutan
undergoes rapid transition with increased urban migration, enrollment pressures at increasingly higher
levels of the education system and changing, life-style-related disease patterns, the cost of delivering
social services has escalated sharply over recent years. This is a result of, among others, increasing
cohorts entering the various levels of education, an aging population in urban areas (together with
changing diets/lifestyles) leading to greater chronic non-communicable diseases, and an increase in the
number of elderly requiring higher pension and health expenditures. A Public Expenditure Review of the
Human Development sector will provide the analytic underpinning for this program. It aims to guide the
Royal Government in decision-making for ensuring sustainable delivery of health, education and social
protection services, with a particular focus on gender.
96.
The World Bank Group will support RGoB’s efforts to improve Bhutan’s system of tertiary
education under this results cluster. This is seen as a key feature for fulfilling the country’s goal to
create a knowledge-based society. This is also linked to other CPS objectives for expanding the private
sector and enhancing the country’s skills and knowledge base for increased employment opportunities.
Results Cluster 4: Access to Quality Public Services
Long-term objectives
Improved access to and quality of social
services through evidence-based resource
allocation and management
Expanded and diversified system of higher
education

Results/outcomes at end of fiscal 2014
 Improved allocation of budgetary resources by utilizing
the findings of poverty maps and other surveys
 Service delivery standards and criteria in place as
evidenced by annual reporting to the National Assembly
 Identification of strategic partnerships with outside
institutes of higher learning
 Quality assurance system established which covers all
programs, degrees and research activities

97.
Improved access to and quality of social services through evidence-based resource allocation
and management. RGoB is examining options for improving spending for the delivery of quality social
services which are accessible to all. The CPS will support RGoB to improve the quality of expenditure
management, with attention to better alignment of budgetary allocations with national objectives and
more coherent understanding of service delivery costs. The CPS will assist authorities in making budget
allocations which are more spatially pro-poor by utilizing the results of poverty mapping, as well as
support RGoB's effort to track progress toward more equitable distribution of resources10. The CPS
program will also support initial work to link budgets with performance in the health and education
sectors. While significant improvements in access and health outcomes have been attained in recent years,
Bhutan’s health sector performance, relative to other countries of similar income level and health
expenditure level, is below average on some important outcomes such as infant and maternal mortality.
This suggests that the efficiency and effectiveness of health spending can be improved. Similar findings
are evident in the education sector.
98.
The CPS will support RGoB in developing and implementing service standards across sectors as
part of efforts for better service delivery to its citizens. Standards are expected to be adopted and
implemented in most agencies during the CPS period. These results will be achieved through a mix of
10

This can be concretely measured by a significant increase in correlation between geog-level allocated budgets and poverty
levels.

24

policy and institutional reforms brought about through development policy operations and analytical
work, including the public expenditure review of the social sectors. Other inputs include a report on
public financial management and technical assistance, plus the development of medium-term fiscal
frameworks and multi-year rolling budgets. The CPS will include continuation of the Bank’s on-going
lending and AAA support to improve public financial management.
99.
Given the importance of hydropower revenues, the Bank will provide advisory services to RGoB
on its management of hydropower revenues to ensure a measure of stabilization in the face of possible
fiscal fluctuations over the coming years as hydropower projects progressively come on-line and levels of
expenditure, debt and revenues rise and fall. This includes the possible establishment of a stabilization or
cushion fund over the medium term.
100.
Expanded and diversified system of higher education. The Bank’s ongoing Education
Development Project (EDP) financed development of the strategic plan for the Royal University of
Bhutan. Subsequent assistance will seek to build on this work and emphasize, in particular, the
establishment of strategic partnerships with outside institutions. Under this CPS, AAA work will be
carried out through a study on policy and strategic options for development of the tertiary education subsector. Three key areas of tertiary education will be targeted: (i) increased access including transition
from vocational to tertiary level studies; (ii) quality of the teaching program, including human resource
capacity; and (iii) relevance of the tertiary education program, particularly to address a knowledge/skillsemployment mismatch.
101.
Possible IFC investment support for private sector participation in the education sector could be
forthcoming. This would complement RGoB’s goal of providing increased access at the middle
secondary, higher secondary and tertiary levels of education. The CPS instruments to achieve this include
an on-going education project, the development policy operation series and analytical work.
102.
Institutional and human resource capacity building will be central to the CPS’s engagement
under this results cluster. At the central level, support through development policy operations for
improving budget planning and management will be key for the delivery of quality services. Technical
assistance could be provided to assist RGoB in examining options for the establishment of a stabilization
or cushion fund to manage future hydropower revenues for financing basic services and meeting other
key government obligations. Technical assistance will be provided to support implementation of RGoB’s
e-governance program. Environmental safeguards and standards for the establishment of new
infrastructure to support service delivery will be adhered to. Following the experience of the 2009
earthquake which caused considerable damage to basic infrastructure, including schools, basic health
units and rural roads, disaster risk management and planning will examine community-based approaches
for mitigating the impact of natural disasters and their impact on service delivery.
D.

Implementing the Strategy
i.

Ongoing program

103.
International Development Association (IDA). Bhutan’s IDA portfolio comprises nine projects
with net commitments of US$84.5 million as of August 2010, with approximately US$48.6 million
disbursed at end-FY10. Overall portfolio performance is satisfactory with a disbursement ratio of 30
percent in FY2009, above the regional average of 29.2 percent. IDA investments in Bhutan are broadly
spread. They include support for rural and urban development, education, HIV/AIDS, PSD, transport,
land management, HIV-AIDS and avian flu prevention. Engagement in the social sectors has shifted over
time from an emphasis on specific investments toward a greater focus on AAA and regular provision of
TA. Bhutan is a pilot country for the Use of Country Systems (UCS) for environment safeguard

25

compliance, and is moving toward adoption of UCS for procurement. Roughly 60 percent of IDA
financing is now used for Development Policy Credit (DPC) operations. Three DPC operations were
completed under the last CAS period, and another is currently under preparation and scheduled to be
presented to the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors along with this CPS.
104.
International Finance Corporation (IFC). Since Bhutan joined IFC as a member country in 2003
and IFC made its first investment (supporting the first FDI) in the country, IFC has been cementing its
presence and support to develop the private sector in Bhutan, including opening an office in Thimphu
with a dedicated staff since November 2009. In the market where the public sector remains dominant in
key sectors, IFC has been providing much needed advisory support11 to the RGoB and private sector to
lay the ground work for building a business-enabling environment while providing investment support as
opportunities arise. In the last CAS period, IFC’s advisory support was especially geared toward
strengthening in four areas: (i) investment climate; (ii) financial sector infrastructure and operations,
including financial inclusion; (iii) Public-Private Partnerships (PPP); and (iv) skills development and the
SME sector. Currently IFC’s portfolio stands at US$7.4 million for one hotel project, committed in FY04.
In the last three years, IFC supported the issuance of 15 trade finance guarantees by two banks for the
total amount of $1.40 million. The GTFP lines have been combined with advisory support, such as on
risk management and IT strategy. IFC is committed to continued development of the financial sector in
Bhutan.
105.
Other Financing Resources: Several Institutional Development Funds (IDF) grants have
supported deepening engagement on macroeconomic, fiscal, and financial management issues. An IDF
grant on Public Financial Management is assisting the development of the MYRB/PEMS for better
performance monitoring. In order to strengthen and harmonize Bhutan‘s environmental safeguard system,
use of country systems to address environmental issues is being piloted under RAP2. An IDF grant is
being implemented through the National Environment Commission Secretariat (NECS) for Strengthening
Institution Capacity for Implementation of Environmental Safeguards. To strengthen the recentlyestablished Public Procurement Policy Division (PPPD), the Bank has approved a three-year IDF which
aims to support the operationalization of this division. An IDF grant has recently been approved to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the MOLHR to facilitate employment and labor market entry of
Bhutanese youth. The Bank is also leveraging support through the Japan Social Development Fund
(JSDF) and the Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR) to support RGoB’s disaster risk
management agenda. Under this CPS, the Bank will seek other sources of funding, including trust funds
and other financing mechanisms such as global funds to support emerging priority areas.
106.
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA): AAA is being carried out in a number of areas,
including: health finance, higher education, investment climate, poverty mapping, e-governance, pension
reform, public financial management, human development expenditure, ICT and agricultural marketing.
Given the relatively small size of the IDA envelop for Bhutan, the Bank’s role as a ‘knowledge bank’ and
its knowledge sharing function is of even greater significance for a small country like Bhutan. With an
increasing emphasis placed on lending through budget support operations, it is imperative that policy
reforms supported by DPCs be adequately grounded in sound analytical work.
ii.

Proposed program

107.
IDA Financing. The CPS will cover the final year of the IDA15 cycle (FY11) and the entire
three-year IDA16 cycle (FY12/13/14). A total of SDR16.5 million (approximately US$24.75
million
equivalent) has already been committed in FY11 for one budget support operation (DPC1). Bhutan’s IDA
11

IFC-managed South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) - in partnership with DFID and NORAD - has been
delivering many of IFC’s advisory services.

26

envelope for FY11–14 is indicatively set at approximately US$78 million, of which about US$52.5
million is expected to be allocated to Bhutan under IDA1612. The proposed IDA program, including
lending and AAA, is presented in Table 3. The primary focus of the program is on results, with lending
instruments and decision-making on advisory and analytical work undertaken to support a strong results
focus. Lending operations will be sequenced to reflect a 60/40 split between budget support operations
and specific investments, respectively. Investment lending will place key emphasis on ensure continued
strengthening of accounting and audit practices within line ministries and implementing units. As the IDA
envelope is small relative to the country’s needs, the CPS will seek to leverage other donor resources.
108.
The Royal Government has indicated its clear preference for development policy
operations. RGoB seeks this modality to benefit from its flexibility in the allocation of resources and
lower transaction costs associated with project preparation. The next proposed budgetary operation will
support the objectives of Bank‘s current investment lending program by highlighting key policy and
institutional changes that will contribute importantly to some of the projects achieving their expected
results. The initiatives under the proposed DPC1, on macroeconomic/fiscal management and fiduciary
systems, will have cross-cutting impacts enhancing the effectiveness of public spending, as well as
include more specific elements that will be central to the implementation of an on-going procurement
training project. The mitigation of social risks through community involvement and community-based
approaches will be addressed across a range of programs through broad stakeholder consultations,
including with communities.
109.
The Bank expects that positive and timely implementation of the CPS program will pave
the way for Bhutan to move to IDA-IBRD blend status at the end of the IDA 16 cycle and under the
next CPS. As of 2010, Bhutan has moved to hardened IDA credit terms, which is anticipated to prevail
throughout the CPS period. While not IBDR eligible at the present time, Bhutan could benefit from IBRD
support through enclave financing. Given Bhutan’s imminent transition from IDA-only status after this
CPS period, this CPS should have a medium- to long-term vision of Bhutan as a middle income country.
Any move from IDA-only status would be based on the outcome of a creditworthiness assessment.
110.
International Finance Corporation. As part of IFC’s regional strategy for South Asia, IFC plans to
focus on the three strategic pillars: (i) Inclusive growth; (ii) Climate change mitigation and adaptation;
and (iii) Global/regional integration. These three strategic pillars are integral to this Bhutan CPS's goals,
promoting sustainable and competitive private sector development in Bhutan. First, the activities
supporting the Inclusive Growth pillar would contribute to employment generation, infrastructure access,
and financial inclusion. Second, activities supporting Climate Change pillar aim at numerous goals
promoted through sustainable urban/rural development, as well as the cross-cutting theme of
environment. Finally, the integration pillar activities, including investment climate support, would assist
in export diversification aligned especially with the CPS’s rural development agenda as well as
institutional capacity building. IFC plans to explore investment and/or advisory support with respect to
following areas: investment climate reforms, the financial sector (including commercial banks and nonbank financial institutions, such as with SME finance, rural finance, trade finance, credit lines, and/or
equity), tourism, agribusiness, and education. In addition, to strengthen infrastructure, IFC considers
exploring ICT, hydropower, transport (airline/bus) and PPP programs, with advisory assistance and
investments. IFC would leverage its advisory and investment program by working closely with the
various WBG teams. The extent to which IFC will be able to provide advisory services will depend on the

12

Bhutan's total IDA resource envelope for FY11-14 is indicative only. Actual allocations will depend on: (i) the
country’s own performance; (ii) its performance relative to that of other IDA recipients; (iii) the amount of overall
resources available to IDA; (iv) changes in the list of active IDA-eligible countries; and (v) terms of financial
assistance provided (grants or loans).

27

ability of clients’ co-funding to leverage IFC’s resources in order to get maximum mileage out of the
funds largely contributed by donors.
111.
IFC is supportive of the government's plans to revive the Private Sector Development Committee
(PSDC) to start building a Public-Private Dialogue as an inclusive mechanism for consultations on crosscutting and sector-specific policies and reforms. Based on its experience in building institutionalized
structured public-private dialogue elsewhere and subject to cost-sharing principles noted above, IFC is
ready to assist in strengthening Public-Private Dialogue implementation. The PSDC would complement
existing and planned PPP advisory projects.
112.
Knowledge sharing. IDA lending will be complemented by a strong, demand-driven AAA
program. This will include Economic and Sector Work (ESW), Non-Lending Technical Assistance
(NLTA) and Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grants. AAA will be sequenced to inform lending
operations, mainly those involving policy reforms under budget support operations, but also to inform
project design for specific investments. Given the small volume of IDA financing available and
increasing use of untied assistance through budget support, AAA takes on greater prominence as a means
of allowing the Bank’s engagement in a number of sectors where no lending is programmed or
envisioned.
113.
Sequencing. Sectors for which specific investments will take place will have operations timed for
maximum coherence with earlier operations. For example, a planned investment in urban development is
scheduled as follow-on to an urban development project approved at the end of the last CAS period. Other
areas for specific investments reflect emerging priorities for the Royal Government, such as fostering a
knowledge society and generating increased and diversified economic activities in rural areas, in part, to
stem urban drift. To enhance the effectiveness of the World Bank Group’s assistance, the CPS will rely
on synergies among lending, technical assistance and analytical work to be delivered in partnership with
the Royal Government, other development partners and the World Bank Group team, which itself will
work as one well-coordinated entity. The policy reform agenda supported by the DPO series will serve as
an umbrella for other lending operations.
114.
Use of country systems. Bhutan stands out in the South Asia region through its use of country
systems for accounting and financial reporting. By contrast, most other countries use some parts of
country systems (for instance, budgeting etc.), but typically create ring-fenced systems for accounting and
reporting for Bank funds. While the Bank works to support Bhutan’s efforts to strengthen its public
financial management systems, the guiding principle in the management of the World Bank portfolio will
be to continue to use country systems in the design of financial management arrangements for Bankfinanced operations. This is reflected in the use of a report-based method of disbursement, maintaining
local currency Designated Bank Accounts, simplification of disbursement processes and other efforts by
way of enhancing the capacity of project staff to use MYRB/PEMS to budget for, maintain project
accounts and prepare periodic financial reports, as required by the Bank.
115.
The Bank has been an active partner in its support to Bhutan’s PFM reform program agenda
through analytic work, IDF grants and other non-lending support. The recently concluded joint
RGoB/World Bank diagnostic study of the PFM system using the Public Financial Management
Performance Measurement Framework, developed by PEFA concluded that Bhutan scores reasonably
well with 18 of the 31 indicators, receiving grades of A or B based on well-defined and objective criteria.
Going forward, RGoB proposes to prepare and adopt a time-bound action plan to bring about
improvement in the PFM framework. The CPS will support RGoB’s initiatives through technical
assistance, diagnostic work and other non-lending support. In all these efforts, the Bank’s will endeavour
to maximize opportunities to reduce transaction costs on the part of the Royal Government in its business
with the Bank. In procurement, a series of assessments are presently underway with the eventual aim of

28

adopting country procurement systems for all Bank-financed operations. Country systems are currently in
use for social and environmental safeguard screening.

Regional engagement. For the first time, this CPS will reflect Bhutan’s increasing role as a
regional leader and, in specific areas, the need to address key issues from a regional perspective. A
13

Not including IFC’s investments and advisory projects beyond FY11.

29

proposed regional operation for wildlife protection, with particular emphasis on tiger conservation, will
allow Bhutan to demonstrate regional leadership as one of several South and East Asian nations identified
as tiger habitats. Bhutan’s reputation for sound environmental stewardship will be enhanced through its
participation in this initiative. This will also support development of Bhutan’s eco-tourism offerings
toward diversifying the tourism sector through with increased wildlife-based tourism, as has been highly
successful in Nepal, India and Thailand.
117. Disaster risk reduction. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures will be woven throughout the
program wherever possible. The full range of DRR-related financing sources and partnerships, such as
GFDRR and JSADF, will be explored to ensure that this agenda is a robust as possible and sufficiently
takes account of the real risks facing Bhutan from natural disasters. Expansion of infrastructure in a
country could have adverse effects on the environment, and is subject to the effects of natural disasters.
The Royal Government has ambitious plans to expand infrastructure for the benefit of the people. The
Bank will continue to support environmental mainstreaming measures and help support the
mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction measures into national development planning, implementation
and budget processing. This could be addressed through the DPC series. A grant totaling US$600,000 has
been made available from GFDRR for the ‘Bhutan Risk and Recovery Program’ following the 2009
earthquake.
GENDER
118.
The CPS considers gender as an integral part of the whole program. It will continue to
monitor activities supported by the World Bank Group to ensure adequate attention to gender issues.
Effective approaches to promoting gender equity will be mainstreamed into the Bank’s program. Gender
will be mainstreamed in Bank programs under all four clusters. Current gender-related challenges suggest
the need for more innovative research and data collection to understand the nature of glass ceiling
phenomenon in Bhutan.
Box 4: Gender and GNH

women’s participation in entrepreneurial activities;
(iii) validate whether Bhutanese women have more difficulties as employees; and (iv) suggest measures to
enhance their participation.

120.
A qualitative study on gender and economic choice will be conducted as a part of the NLTA on
poverty monitoring. It will inform the 2012 World Development Report on Gender Equality and
Development. A poverty assessment in FY 2013 will measure progress on gender from the BLSS 2012
and provide analysis for the formation of the next five-year plan. Other possible AAA incorporating
gender includes the Access to Finance TA, the Higher Education Sector Note and the Urbanization and
Growth study. Results of AAA activities on gender can be used to showcase Bhutan, as it is one of few
low income countries that men and women are quite equal. To that end, Bhutan may offer a ‘success’ and
‘positive’ story in terms of showing what a society would look like if there is gender equality and its

30

related benefits. Annex 5, ‘Gender Mainstreaming in the Bhutan CPS’ provides additional information on
how gender is addressed under the CPS program.
RESULTS MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT
121.
Bhutan benefits from good clarity in its five-year plans, and is largely results-based,
particularly in its budgeting framework. This is further strengthened through the introduction of the
Results-Based Management (RBM) concept during the formulation of the 10FYP. The direct results of
this mechanism are reflected in the plans and programs of the central and local governments which appear
more dynamic, needs driven, results-oriented and responsive to the emerging challenges. The CPS should,
similarly, be results based and harmonized with the national monitoring framework manifested in PlaMS
and accompanied by a robust monitoring framework, particularly for development policy operations as a
means of informing subsequent budget support investments. The World Bank Group will strengthen its
results-based monitoring and evaluation to better assess how World Bank Group activities are
contributing to results on the ground. The CAS Completion Report indicates that not all projects and the
program itself have been effective in monitoring results-based indicators on a regular basis. This, in turn,
has led to difficulties in assessment and in making mid-course corrections.
122.
The CPS will draw upon OPCS’ recently developed ‘Country Portfolio and Results
Monitoring Tool’ (CPRT). The CPRT aims to improve the quality and alignment of results frameworks
between country programs and projects in order to provide high quality CPS and sector results reports to
Bank management, the Board, and external stakeholders in a harmonized, efficient and reliable manner.
123.
This is a results-based CPS with outcomes and monitorable indicators. The World Bank
Group will support program monitoring through:
 greater analytical work prior to investment so that results indicators are well integrated into
strategy
 increased attention to project design
 strengthening project supervision, which is also expected to be buttressed by the presence of a
fulltime Representative based in Thimphu
124.
The CPS results matrix, which was developed in partnership with the Royal Government,
tracks progress in the main areas of engagement. The Bank team will track progress through regular
impact reviews at the time of the joint RGoB/World Bank Group CPS review. The Bank teams will work
directly with Royal Government agencies to track results and identify factors affecting them. It will
support the ongoing activities of RGoB to strengthen the integration of the Results-Based Management
(RBM) Framework in the planning process and also the national M&E system. RGoB introduced the
RBM concept in the 10FYP planning process to ensure focus on the results and outcomes of the
intervention as opposed to processes and inputs. One such system currently being developed to
mainstream RBM and to ensure effective monitoring of the results is the Planning and Monitoring System
(PlaMS). This system when integrated with the Public Expenditure Management System and the MYRB
offers promising prospects in terms of providing a coherent national mechanism for ensuring effective
monitoring and evaluation of the development plans and programs. The CPS Progress Report will
reevaluate the results framework in light of implementation, exogenous developments, and adjustments to
the Bank’s program. This CPS will include a client survey to gauge both progress toward achieving
results and alignment with the Royal Government’s own priorities as they evolve and client/stakeholder
satisfaction.
125.
The CPS will help RGoB strengthen its statistical capacity. This will be achieved through the
DPC series and self-standing technical assistance, such as advancing work on poverty mapping and

31

strengthening the capacity of the National Statistics Bureau. The 2005 census provided solid benchmarks
for tracking progress toward development outcomes, particularly on social issues, for which resultstracking has been weak. To further address the issue of data inadequacy to enhance decision making, the
CPS will assist in strengthening capacity for collecting regular and better quality data and developing
tools to analyze them.
126.
CPS implementation will be reviewed on a regular basis together with the Royal
Government. This aims to assess progress and propose necessary adjustments to the Bank program and
strategic approach. A CPS Progress Report will be prepared at mid-term or before, if deemed necessary.
Projected lending in the outer years (FY13/14) will be reviewed at the time of the CPS Progress Report
and may be adjusted depending on IDA allocations and progress toward CPS objectives. The IDA
portfolio performance will also be reviewed periodically and projects will be restructured as needed and
freed up resources will be redirected to emerging priorities.
DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS
127.
Strong development partnerships will continue under the CPS. The community of resident
development partners in Bhutan is very small, and limited to two multilateral organizations (United
Nations, World Bank Group), and a handful of bilateral partners (India, Japan, Denmark, Switzerland,
Austria, Netherlands and Canada). Non-resident development partners include ADB, the European Union,
Norway and Australia. India is Bhutan’s largest development partner. Given the small size of the donor
community in Bhutan, donor coordination is carried out through monthly information sharing meetings.
The donor activities mapped along the CPS areas of engagement are captured in Annex 4.
128.
Donor support in Bhutan is aligned with the 10FYP/PRSP. Development partners' areas of
focus reflect, for the most part, the Royal Government’s suggestions and requests, as well as each
development partner’s comparative advantages. The World Bank Group is a member of the UN Country
Team. The UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) elaboration will be led by the Office of
the Resident Coordinator. The UN will begin preparations for the next UNDAF cycle (2013-2017) in
mid-2011. The UNDAF describes the collective response of the UN Country Team to the priorities in the
national development framework. Several donor sub-groups have been formed to examine, in an on-going
manner, specific areas of interest. With establishment of the World Bank Group’s first country office in
Bhutan, closer coordination among development partners is anticipated.
129.
Harmonization and donor coordination are critical issues for managing development
partner relations and activities in a small country such as Bhutan. Small size and good governance
make Bhutan a good candidate for further reliance on country systems, and a country that can benefit
substantially from simplification agendas. During the CPS period, the Bank, in close coordination with
development partners, will strive to rely incrementally on country institutions and procedures, initially
through sectors where capacity to ensure compliance of safeguards and fiduciary requirements is
considered to be adequate. At the same time, capacity will be strengthened in weak sectors/areas, while
the country team will endeavor to maximize opportunities to reduce transaction costs and project
processing by applying in Bhutan, to the extent possible, simplification processes and the use of new
policies for streamlining procedures and enhancing procedural efficiencies.
130.
Under the CPS, IDA funds will be used to catalyze donor resources. This will be done
through several instruments, including global funds for climate change, health-related global fundsupported initiatives, and bilateral partner-specific trust funds. The World Bank Group will explore
possibilities for other operations to be prepared and implemented in close partnership with donors,
building on successes and lessons learned.

32

RISKS
131.
The World Bank Group program in Bhutan faces two types of risks in implementation of
the CPS. The first set of risks is related to factors endogenous to the implementation environment and
reflective of Bhutan’s specific development challenges and levels of progress. The second set of risks is
related to the design of the program itself, particularly since some key aspects of the program will be
defined during implementation, such as the rural support program and the social agenda after the PER.
While no major risks that are likely to derail the country program, there are some risks which may affect
implementation progress and for which mitigation measures are or will be in place.
132.

Risks related to the implementation environment.

(a) Macroeconomic. External shocks could impact the macroeconomic framework. As a small
landlocked country, Bhutan faces several vulnerabilities, including, most notably, the heavy
reliance on hydropower sales to India for its budget, balance of payments, and growth prospects.
The heavy dependence on India as a source of external assistance, as the major trading partner
and the critical buyer for electricity exports also make Bhutan liable to shocks that affect the
Indian economy — although, given that assistance to Bhutan is a very small share of India‘s
resources, there was no significant pass through of the effects of the recent global financial crisis
from India to Bhutan. In addition, swings in the investment outlays for investment in electricity
generation and swings in revenues from its sales induce volatilities that call for a very careful
macroeconomic management. An emphasis on establishing a sound medium-term fiscal
framework through budget support operations should help ensure that the multi-year
consequences of investments and other decisions are forecast and taken into account. The focus
on improving the general environment for private sector development should also help the
country realize more of its potential for economic diversification.
(b) Capacity. The preceding CAS identified risks related to technical capacity constraints and put
forward some mitigation measures, including the provision of appropriate technical assistance,
which this CPS takes on board. In addition to technical capacity, high-level managerial capacity
is also in short supply and may be adversely affected by the political transition. To some extent,
familiarity with Bank procedures and continuity of key counterpart officials help mitigate this
risk. As in the case of the earlier CASs, capacity constraints are mitigated, in part, through
selectivity of focus and a small number of Bank-financed operations. One objective of the CPS is
to leverage technical assistance resources from the Bank and other development partners.

Risks related to the program

(c) Lack of clarity on issues. While the CPS broadly identifies a number of key issues facing
Bhutan’s development, including the lack of private sector capacity to provide sufficient levels of
employment, a labour market/skills mismatch and insufficient provision of services and
infrastructure, a clearer understanding of a number of development challenges which the CPS will
seek to address will emerge through planned analytical activities. For example, the public
expenditure review of the human development sectors will reveal areas needing attention and
which the CPS could address. The CPS Progress Report will take stock of the results of the
analytical work and will agree with the authorities on how to deepen further the engagement in
social areas.
This CPS charters into new and more complex areas of engagement, which places added
pressure on implementation. It represents an overall shift in the World Bank Group’s assistance

33

to Bhutan with its focus on a number of new areas which reflect the changing nature of Bhutan’s
development challenges. While in the past the needs which were addressed through the Bank’s
assistance were largely for the expansion of basic services in education, transport, etc., the issues
which this CPS addresses are more complex insofar as they have no immediate resolution as
compared to, for example, the strategy to build more schools to increase enrollment. To that end,
the Bank’s global experience and knowledge is sought as Bhutan seeks to learn from the example
of other countries that have faced similar development challenges and tap into best practice and
cutting-edge thinking and approaches for addressing complex economic and social challenges.
This risk will be mitigated by strategically and selectively engaging with the Royal Government
with a carefully tailored mix of financing and knowledge sharing, while recognizing that few, if
any, of these challenges are to be resolved in the course of a single four-year CPS period. To that
end, the World Bank Group recognizes the need to ensure continuity from the last CAS period
and areas of engagement it encompassed, and look forward to the next CPS period as a means of
laying the ground work for the World Bank Group’s medium- to long-term engagement in new
areas, such as ICT, private sector development and youth employment.

Period covered by the CAS CR:
CAS CR completed by: Niels Planel

Bhutan
November 18, 2005
FY06-FY09
Title: Consultant
Date: September 1st, 2009

The objective of this CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) is to evaluate the effectiveness of the World
Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for the Kingdom of Bhutan for FY06-FY09, by examining the
extent to which expected CAS outcomes were achieved. The Bank’s performance in designing and
implementing the CAS toward achieving these outcomes is also assessed. Finally, the CAS CR
identifies lessons relevant to the design and implementation of the next CAS for Bhutan.
A. Government Objectives and the CAS Context
When the 2005 CAS was being formulated, Bhutan had continued its progressive opening up to the
world, especially through tourism. During this process, the country had experienced rapid social and
economic development as a result of prudent macroeconomic management, beneficial exploitation of
hydropower resources, and substantial support from development partners. Nestled between China and
India in the eastern Himalayas, the topography of Bhutan provides the country with enormous
hydropower potential in addition to substantial forest resources and biodiversity. The country had
started to exploit hydropower resources through a mutually beneficial arrangement for capital
development support in exchange for concession on hydropower sales to India.
Driven by its hydropower development and strong donor support, Bhutan has enjoyed robust economic
performance, with GDP growth averaging over 6 percent per annum over the past two decades. At the
same time, electricity export revenues have strengthened the role of the public sector in the economy.
In contrast, the private sector had remained small, and a substantial portion of the population continues
to be engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The CAS was prepared following the completion of the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), which was based on the Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP). The 9FYP was framed by Bhutan’s
specific development vision of increasing Gross National Happiness, and reflected the efforts of the
Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) to improve the well-being of the Bhutanese despite the
challenges imposed by the country’s mountainous geography and location. Since RGoB became a
member of IFC in December 2003, it was also the first CAS jointly prepared by IDA and IFC.
The timing and net impact of the Tala Hydropower Project (1020MW) was deemed to be critical
during the CAS period for maintaining growth, sustaining RGoB’s efforts to expand access to better
infrastructure and services, meeting increasing recurrent costs, and ensuring sound fiscal and debt
management.
Bhutan has enjoyed peace and stability and following the adoption of a new constitution, the country
moved to a constitutional monarchy. However, since the system of governance changed during the
CAS period, some priorities originally drawn in the CAS results matrix were reformulated. The first
parliamentary elections, held in January 2008, also were a major distraction. One notable consequence
has been the slight mismatch between what was originally planned in the CAS and a few outcomes.
B. CAS Objectives and Outcomes
The World Bank’s CAS for FY06-09 aligned itself with the goals and priorities of the 9FYP.
Specifically, the CAS supported development based on three pillars: i) Expanding Access to Better
Infrastructures and Social Services, and Connecting Communities to Market; ii) Promoting Private
Sector Development and Employment; iii) Strengthening Management of Pubic Resources, and
Monitoring and Evaluation of Development Outcomes. The first pillar was considered essential since

41

access was one of the most critical challenges for Bhutan. The Bank Group specifically supported
efforts by RGoB to expand and improve rural road access, improve quality and coverage of urban
services in selected towns, promote access to quality education, and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
The second pillar was deemed fundamental to ensure the twin goals of rapid growth and employment
generation for youth. As a consequence, and in line with the priorities of the 9FYP, the Bank helped
Bhutan in reducing critical constraints to private sector development and increase agricultural
productivity and diversification. The third pillar was chosen to strengthen macroeconomic framework
and policies, improve public expenditure management and bolster poverty monitoring and evaluation,
as emphasized in the JSAN of the 9FYP. Additionally, the Bank supported crosscutting efforts related
to decentralization, good governance, and environmental management. The Bank assisted in
improving controls, planning and execution procedures, and transparency and accountability.
Overall, in terms of achievement of its outcomes, the CAS is rated Moderately Satisfactory:


The outcomes under the Infrastructures Pillar are rated Moderately Satisfactory. The
positive rating reflects the fact that most of the expected outcomes were achieved in a
moderately satisfactory or satisfactory manner. Some projects did not take into account the
priorities stated in the CAS, such as increasing access to adequate urban services in Thimphu
and will only do so in the FY10-13 CAS, but the Bank delivered tangible results in line with
its overall strategy.



The outcomes under Private Sector Pillar are rated Satisfactory. Under the Development
Policy Grant, the Bank achieved all its objectives in a satisfactory manner, resulting in an
enhanced investment climate for private sector development and helping support steady
growth. Moreover, the agriculture productivity increased during the course of the CAS
implementation and farmers benefited from better access to market, reduction in transportation
costs and access to agricultural services.



The outcomes under the Public Resources Pillar are rated Moderately Satisfactory. While
clear targets were set during the design of the CAS, procurement became a major issue during
the implementation period and priorities changed. This also reflects the fact that RGoB’s new
governance influenced the outcomes of the pillar. However, the Bank took into account
RGoB’s weak capacities in terms of procurement and acted to strengthen them.



Finally, the outcomes regrouped in the Cross Cutting Issues Pillar are rated Satisfactory.
The projects under this Pillar delivered the expected outcomes and met the Bank’s objectives
while supporting decentralization, good governance and environmental management.

Pillar I
At the time of CAS preparation, access was one of the most critical challenges for Bhutan.
Accordingly, the first pillar focuses on access to infrastructure, services, and markets. The original key
objectives envisioned for the CAS under this pillar were to: i) improve rural road access and quality of
road network; ii) increase access to adequate urban services in Thimphu and selected towns; iii)
improve access to and quality of education; and iv) change in risky behaviors and better treatments of
STIs. One of the major Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) was the Bhutan Urban Strategy,
which provided input for the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10FYP).

transmission areas

Outcome 1: Improve rural road access and quality of road network
Improving the level of accessibility has been incremental in reducing poverty and has influenced
several outcomes, such as education, economic growth and cross-cutting issues. The Rural Access
Project played a critical role in expanding access to better infrastructure and social services, and

43

connecting communities to markets by achieving a significant reduction in travel time and transport
costs. Travel time to reach hospitals and markets was reduced by 76 percent (versus 50 percent as set
at appraisal), on average, and transport costs has declined by 75 percent (versus 50 percent as set at
appraisal). The travel time to school in the project areas declined from more than six hours to around
one hour at the end of the project. A wider acceptance of and adherence to environmental safeguards
in construction and maintenance practices resulted from the implementation of the project, with the
National Environmental Commission now mandating Environmentally Friendly Road Construction
(EFRC) approaches in all roads projects under the purview of various agencies.
Since 2007, the Second Rural Access Project has built on the progress made so far and provides new
connectivity to remote villages, supports EFRC approaches and puts the accent on building capacity
for maintenance and rural road management. All improvement works envisaged during the appraisal
have been completed.
Outcome 2: Increase access to adequate urban services in Thimphu and selected towns
Increasing access to adequate urban services in ten towns of Bhutan was critical to support RGoB’s
objective of achieving carefully planned growth of secondary towns. The Urban Development Project
increased serviced urban lands, allowing 100 per cent of the selected town areas to get piped water
coverage at the end of the project (June 2006). However, households’ connections had yet to be
provided when the project closed. As of June 2006, a total of forty-four employees were trained in the
operation and maintenance of urban services and infrastructure financed under the project, while no
systemic operation and maintenance regime existed at the start. Surveys also showed that citizens’
satisfaction with the project’s results has been high, although there were some shortcomings in the
treatment of the data. Even though the design of the CAS’ results matrix included Thimphu in the
outcome, the Urban Development Project did not affect the capital and the indicators capture the
impact of the project on selected secondary towns. The Second Urban Development Project will focus
exclusively on Thimphu. Due to delays in project preparation of the proposed Second Urban
Development Project, the project has not commenced during this CAS period. A National Urban
Strategy as well as a Thimphu's City Development Strategy were formulated with IDA's assistance,
and provided inputs for the 10FYP.
Outcome 3: Improve access to and quality of education
Through its support since 1988, the Bank has successfully contributed to good progress on educational
outcomes in Bhutan. Beginning with support to the primary education, the Bank has progressively
extended its assistance to secondary education, under a co-financing arrangement with the Swiss
Development Corporation (SDC). The Education Development Project extends support to middle and
higher education on the basis of the sector development strategy underpinning the 9FYP/PRSP.
Overall implementation progress has remained apace with the project target for additional strident
places expected to be exceeded.
Outcome 4: Change in risky behaviors and better treatments of STIs
Prevalence of HIV in Bhutan continues to be very low at less than 0.1 percent and condom use with
last non-regular partner was higher than projected at project start-up. While condom use is high, a very
concentrated epidemic could emerge in population groups having multiple concurrent sex partners,
and/or injecting drug use behaviors if safe behavior is not consistently adopted. To date, these groups
appear to be extremely small. The Bank project has made important contributions to improve
awareness about HIV and how to prevent it. It has also contributed to building the evidence base for
future action. RGoB was effective in reaching the general population but encountered difficulties with
high risk groups, as to date, the only risk group identified are sex workers, as Bhutan does not follow
the transmission pattern found elsewhere. To strengthen the effectiveness of STI treatment, treatment
protocols have been modified on the basis of a gonococcal susceptibility study and new guidelines
were developed and adopted (by May 2006). By June 2007, training of prescribing staff at all hospitals

44

and BHUs was carried out (Feb 2007) and the new drugs were distributed. A prescription audit noted
that additional training is required. Since then, refresher training has been provided in two of the three
regions. A health facility survey is almost completed which will indicate the extent to which treatment
has improved.
Pillar II
To ensure the twin goals of rapid growth and employment generation for youth, the 9FYP placed a
high priority on the development of the private sector. Agriculture has been the mainstay of rural
employment, and as such received focused attention in the 9FYP period. Key results envisioned under
the Pillar 2 were to: i) obtain a reduction in selected critical constraints to private sector development;
and ii) increase agricultural productivity and diversification in geogs (sub-district level). The
Development Policy Grant (DPG) I & II played a major role.

Outcome 1: Obtain a reduction in selected critical constraints to private sector development
The DPG program supported several RGoB reforms to enhance the investment climate for private
sector development (PSD) and employment generation. There has been substantial progress in
implementing the PSD reforms, and Bhutan is noted as one of the top reformers in South Asia in the
2008 Doing Business Report. RGoB’s efforts included improving the functioning of labor markets
through the development of flexible labor and employment laws and regulations; creating an enabling
environment for foreign direct investment (FDI); fostering the development of the private sector; and
reducing the cost of doing business by simplifying the business registration process. The first Labor
and Employment Act was enacted in 2007, and related rules and regulations were drafted to bring
more flexibility to the labor market. A new FDI policy is being finalized with a view to relaxing the
minimum required amount of FDI, easing the restriction on share holdings for foreign investment, and
allowing investment in Indian Rupees. The number of FDI projects increased from two in 2002 to ten
in 2007. The Tourism Act has been prepared and is still undergoing final revisions before being tabled
to Parliament. Some of the provisions of the Bill are already being implemented. Tourism Policy and
Rules and Regulations are in place to facilitate tourism growth, and the number of tourist arrivals

45

increased from 9,249 (2004) to 27,636 (2008). In an effort to improve corporate governance and
operational efficiency in the state owned enterprises (SOEs), RGoB established Druk Holding and
Investments (DHI) in November, 2007, and transferred its shares in twelve companies to DHU. With a
view to fostering the ICT sector, the RGoB enacted the Bhutan Information, Communication & Media
Act in 2006, aimed at encouraging local and foreign investment in the ICT and media industry by
providing a modern regulatory framework that encourages a convergence of information, computing,
media, and communications technologies, as well as facilitating privatization and competition.
Through the BT Private Sector Development project, an incentive framework was adopted by the
Cabinet to facilitate FDI in the IT-enabled services sector. The revised FDI policy built on this
framework.
Outcome 2: Increase agricultural productivity and diversification in geogs
The Decentralized Rural Development project has shown good progress in its implementation, notably
in community irrigation schemes, agricultural extension services in six project dzonkhags and
increased food and cash crop production. A 29 per cent increase in food crop production (rice &
maize) as well as a 23 per cent increase in cash crops (potato & mandarin) for targeted geogs resulted
from the implementation of the project. Training on vegetable production, nursery development and
other high value crop production such as walnuts and mushrooms have been given to nearly 1400
households. These households have taken up improved agriculture technologies (improved seeds).
This extension through the DRDP funding has included those households who were not covered under
regular extension activities of the dzongkhags since they have been targeted at households newly
connected to markets through the infrastructure works. The irrigation component has made satisfactory
progress in terms of achieving its physical target. In terms of the originally planned 45 kms of new
construction, a revised target of 44.3 km is set to be completed by June 2010. To date, 39.8 km of new
channels have been completed. Currently the revised target for renovation of the channels is 218 km of
which 164 km has been completed. The PDO appears to be achievable as a result of good progress in
the construction of Farm Roads, Power Tiller Tracks, community irrigation schemes, construction and
operation of RNR (renewable natural resource) centers and agricultural extension services in six
project dzonkhags, thereby leading to better access to market, reduction in transportation costs and
access to agricultural services.
Due to the improvement of road access, the Rural Access Project has also enabled farmers to reach
produce to markets with reduced time and damage in transits.
Pillar III
With an expected substantial increase in revenue from hydropower exports, improving controls,
planning and execution procedures, and transparency and accountability were to be given a high
priority. Increased public investment also made more urgent the need to tackle the limited capacity for
measuring development results. Under the Public Resources Pillar, the key outcomes envisioned for
the CAS were to: i) improve budget management and public financial management, and ii) improve
capacity for monitoring and assessment of development outcomes. The DPG I & II and an IDF grant
(Improving Public Financial Management) has been critical in supporting the PFM sector in Bhutan.

Outcome 1: Improve budget management and public financial management
The reforms and institutional changes under the DPG program have helped facilitate closer
macroeconomic monitoring, strengthen debt management, and improve the budget preparation
process, which together underpin sound policy formulation for sustained robust growth and service
delivery. The Macroeconomic Framework Coordination Committee (MFCC), established in 2005, has
been the focal group preparing macroeconomic and fiscal projections. New debt management
software, the CS-DRMS (Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System), has
been acquired, and staff have been trained in the use of this tool to improve debt monitoring and carry
out debt sustainability analyses. The systems for debt monitoring are operational, and debt reports are
being prepared. Most notably, the Public Finance Act, which was passed in June 2007, provides for the
development of a three-year Budget Policy and Fiscal Framework Statement (BPFFS), which is the
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF). This is a major reform, and the BPFFS has helped
encourage substantive discussions of policy in the National Assembly and raise the effectiveness of
budget policy making overall. These reforms have helped improve RGoB’s ability to anticipate shocks
and mitigate economic volatility.
In terms of predictable budget preparation and execution as underpinned by the MTFF, the RGoB has
made considerable progress during the CAS period. As mandated by the Public Finance Act of Bhutan
2007, a BPFFS compiled by the Policy and Planning Division of the Ministry of Finance matches
overall expenditure with the availability of resources in the medium term on a rolling basis. The key
aggregates of potential deficit, external and internal debt, as well as instruments of financing are also
projected in the BPFFS. These projections are part of the Finance Minister’s bi-annual Budget Report
to the Parliament.
In terms of variation between planned budget and actual expenditures at the sectoral level, an analysis
of data over the last three years shows that actual expenditures have not deviated by more than 10
percent from planned expenditures at the aggregate level. At the sectoral level, however, variance in
expenditure composition has been higher, and shows a slight increase. Reasons do include ad-hoc
budget incorporations, but are also due to incorporation of externally funded projects under the GoI
program grant during the Financial Year, as well as mid-year changes on account of unforeseen and
natural calamities.

47

One of the main components of a sound public procurement system is the existence of a centralized
government body to manage, oversee and support the public procurement system. As part of the
reforms to improve public expenditure and to ensure good governance, RGoB has undertaken various
steps towards creating an efficient, effective, transparent, and fair national procurement system. The
Bank, in collaboration with the donor group in Bhutan, has been working with the government in the
following areas: (i) renewing the procurement manual and its accompanying standard bidding
documents and request for proposals, (ii) creating a procurement policy unit, (iii) addressing the need
for procurement grievance mechanisms, (iv) assessing the readiness for using e-procurement, and (v)
building the capacity of national institutions responsible for training people on public procurement.
Items (i) and (ii) have been completed to date with an IDF grant under implementation to strengthen
the newly formed Public Procurement Policy Division under the Ministry of Finance. Item (v) above is
also being addressed through a three year $1.5m Institutional Capacity Building Project for
Procurement which became effect in July 2008. For items (iii) and (iv) above the RGoB commissioned
a policy note and report respectively to analyse the best way forward in those two areas of the reform.
Since the delivery of those two documents by the Bank in 2007, no progress has been made, but the
RGoB remains committed to take up these two components of the reform in 2009 and 2010.
An official order was issued in April of 2008 for the establishment of the Public Procurement Policy
Division (PPPD) in the Ministry of Finance. Given the importance of a strong PPPD, the Bank made a
grant of US$484,000 the main focus of which is to strengthen the PPPD. The IDF also supports the
continued regulatory reform of the procurement legislation and access to information, public
awareness and e-GP. The full-scale implementation was expected to start during the summer of 2009.
Under the ADB funded project (Financial Sector Development Project), the process of selection of
international consultants to provide technical assistance for the determination of accounting
standards for Bhutan has been completed. Supported by technical assistance provided by the
World Bank the Department of Public Accounts has adjusted the Government annual financial
statements (2006-07) to comply with IPSAS (Cash basis) requirements for financial reporting and
identified the next steps required for full adoption of IPSAS. An IDF grant is presently supporting
some important initiatives underway, including selection of international consultants to help
RGoB consolidate and strengthen its internal audit function.
Outcome 2: Improve capacity for monitoring and assessment of development outcome
The Bank began supporting statistical issue in FY08 through the TF for Statistical Capacity Building
(TFSCB) which aimed to build capacity of the National Statistical Bureau (NSB) and assist the
preparation of the National Statistics Development Strategy (NSDS), which is the master plan to
reform the statistical system. The strategy was finalized with consultation with stakeholders in October
2008. Following that effort, the NLTA for poverty monitoring (FY09-10) supports the NSDS
implementation, particularly on improvements of poverty monitoring instruments, strengthening the
statistical Geographical Information System (GIS) capacity, establishment of a new data dissemination
system, and assistance for the statistical law preparation. The component of the NLTA on GIS is to
create a multi-topic database at the geog level for policy planning and coordinate data from different
ministries and make them more usable both for M&E and for planning. Poverty mapping is another
area of M&E on poverty where Bhutan is gaining capacity since FY09. The preliminary results of
poverty mapping were shared with the NSB and the GNHC in June 2009. Efforts on poverty mapping
will make M&E more efficient at the geog level; it will support the effort presented in the 10th plan to
introduce a new formula-based resource allocation to local governments based on local poverty
incidence.
RGoB is moving in the right direction to gain more understanding of poverty and vulnerability.
Capacity building on poverty and vulnerability monitoring and analysis are supported by the ongoing
NLTA for poverty monitoring. So far, NSB still does not have full capacity to carry out analysis on
poverty by itself, but it has many educated staff and a sufficient technical foundation to build upon. A

48

Bank team has delivered training courses to staff from NSB and GNHC on poverty analysis and
poverty mapping and will continue engaging in capacity building on poverty analysis. A population
and housing census was conducted in May 2005 and the results were published in mid 2006. The
Census was carried out with support from United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
It should also be noted that the governance system having changed following the adoption of a new
constitution, the priorities of RGoB evolved over the CAS period and some projects suffered from a
lack of appropriate monitoring.
Cross-cutting issues
Decentralization, good governance and environmental management involved crosscutting efforts, and
the Bank selectively supported these during the CAS period, focusing on efforts that would have the
greatest impact and were critical to achieving the three strategic objectives or pillar of the CAS. Key
results envisioned under the Cross-Cutting Issues Pillar were i) to increase capacity for decentralized
rural development; ii) to improve capacity for decentralized school management; and iii) increase
environmental management capacity at the national, sector, and local level.

Outcome 1: Increase capacity for decentralized rural development
The Decentralized Rural Development project has proved successful so far. While the targeted
population is learning by doing, the local governments are managing the project in a satisfactory
manner. The project is building the capacity of the dzongkhags and improving the public financial
management at the same time. The transfer of resources to local level was improved and the DRDP
funds are now managed by the dzongkhags. The project has implemented various training courses for
dzongkhag and Geog project staffs. 28 separate trainings in the field of rural roads, irrigation, financial
management, community mobilization and socio-economic baseline survey have been provided to

49

about 1600 officials. The capacity for Environmental Assessment (EA) of farm roads and irrigation
works has been improved through the training of 60 extension agents.
Outcome 2: Improve capacity for decentralized school management
This outcome has been satisfactorily achieved through of capacity building among MOE personnel at
all levels (central, dzongkhag, school) during SEP. Training using both long- and short-term
fellowships included areas such as school administration and management, procurement, human
resource management, vocational training, aptitude testing and public finance and budgeting, among
others. A school management guide has been developed and regular school monitoring by EMSD,
DEOs and focal persons has been institutionalized. There are now 273 personnel at MOE with
strengthened capacity and a total of 43 DEOs/Assistant DEOs in the country's 20 dzongkhags.
Education monitoring has been identified by MOE as a priority area for education system
development. Training was provided to education officials at all levels to carry out school-level
monitoring and support functions.
Outcome 3: Increase environmental management capacity at the national, sector, and local level
The Sustainable Land Management (SLM) project has been effective in so far as it has introduced a
new, bottom-up approach for land planning. Following the initial focus on the pilot on-the-ground
investments at the beginning of the project, efforts are now being made to extend and mainstream
SLM approaches in other sector policies and programs. The project has supported the development of
rules and regulations for implementation of the revised Land Act of 2007 and enhancing understanding
of rangeland management issues that would later contribute to the revision of grazing policy and
regulations. RGoB, the Bank, DANIDA and UNDP also conducted a joint review to harmonize their
inputs. At this stage of the project implementation, 174 farmers in Radi, 91 in Nanghkor and 104
farmers in Phuentsholing are practicing sustainable land management techniques (369 farmers
overall).
The Rural Access Project has succeeded in raising awareness regarding the need to adopt
environmentally sustainable construction practices, and many important generic outputs have been
generated to promote EFRC, such as Environmental Codes of Practice and EFRC guidelines, standard
bidding documents, etc, which have found a wider application in road development projects in the
country. The National Environmental Commission has mandated EFRC application in all road projects
under the responsibility of various agencies.
As part of the effort to support the Paris Declaration of March 2005 on Aid Effectiveness and the
strengthening and use of developing country systems, the Bank Board approved the use of Bhutan's
national policies to address environmental safeguards associated with the Rural Access II Project.
The Bank has also financed several inputs aimed at environmentally sound waste management. The
Bank has developed Infection Control and Healthcare Waste Management (IC & HCWM) guidelines,
training for their application and procured an autoclave for the main hospital and supplies for waste
segregation. Burial pits for waste were also built according to a plan that was developed and agreed
with the Bank.
C. Measuring Bank Group Performance
1. Quality of Products and Services
Lending
During the CAS period, four World Bank projects came to closure and ICRs were prepared for each.
Development Policy Grants I and II were assessed in the same ICR. All the ICRs were reviewed by the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). Table A4 presents the results of completed ICRs and

50

corresponding IEG ratings. Overall, the projects’ ratings were good, with a majority of projects rated
Satisfactory. There is mostly consistency between the ICR and IEG ratings on the outcomes, although
of the four projects reviewed by the IEG, the borrower’s performance was rated one category below
the ICR ratings for three projects.
During the CAS period, the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) conducted a Quality Assessment of
Lending Portfolio (QALP-1) for two projects: the HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention and Control project
and the Sustainable Land Management project. There was a Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA)
for the Education Development Project. While the Land Management project obtained a positive
rating, the likelihood of achieving DOs of the HIV/STI project was deemed Moderately
Unsatisfactory/Unlikely. QAG rated the overall quality of supervision of the Education Development
Project as Moderately Satisfactory.

Economic and Sector Work
Overall, the Bank has been proactive in the field of Economic and Sector Work (ESW), with a total of
11 ESWs, 4 Technical Assistances (TA) and 2 IDF grants undertaken during the CAS period. Several
among them have been critical in fostering the Bank’s program in RGoB. The Bhutan Urban Strategy
provided inputs for the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10FYP). An IDF grant (Improving Public Financial
Management) has been deemed essential in supporting the PFM sector in Bhutan.
In the health sector, the Ministry of Health has requested inputs on health financing and options for
private sector contribution both in financing and provision. The Bank has been planning a workshop in
the fall of 2009 which should lead to some future ESW to assist RGoB in its decision-making process.
2. Portfolio Performance
During the CAS period, the number of projects remained constant, with around five projects a year,
representing an average of US$ 61 million and commitment varying from US$ 44 million to US$ 72.5
million. The average disbursement ratio for Bhutan during this period was 25.3 percent.

D. Aid Coordination
During the CAS period, the Bank has worked effectively with its development partners. Since the
Bank did not have a country office in RGoB, the CAS was developed through regional meetings held
when the Country Director was in-country, and in consultation with development partners. Key
missions were organized and recognized the need for coordination. Due to the resource constraint for
several Bank projects in Bhutan, a few TTLs believe a better coordination among donors could help
deliver improved results in the future.
The Bank was the only donor working on HIV at the beginning of the CAS period, with the exception
of the UN agencies making modest contributions in each of their own areas. Joint missions with
Danida have been carried twice, to review the health sector overall (and HIV within it). The Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) has now been involved for the last 18 months, but
coordination is extremely limited.
As part of the donor harmonization effort, Danida has been providing support for eleven new natural
resource proposals through the Sustainable Land Management project, amounting to over
US$500.000.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided the original assistance to the government in the mid
1990s to create procurement rules and regulations, which were incorporated in Chapter 17 of the
Financial Manual. Recognizing that their procurement rules were due for some updating to align
themselves with internationally accepted best practice and to cater to the changing Bhutanese context,
RGoB requested assistance from the World Bank in September of 2005.
On PFM, the close collaboration and synergy with other development partners' inputs has been
positive. Under the ADB funded project (Financial Sector Development Project), the process of
selection of international consultants to provide technical assistance for the determination of
accounting and auditing standards for Bhutan has been completed.
The ADB has been the main donor supporting the financial sector so far. The Bank has engaged in the
sector through a component of the Bhutan PSD project by supporting the development of a national
payment system, an area not covered under ADB support. This component complements a pillar of the
Development Policy Grant on fostering private sector dynamism by enhancing access to credit. The
Bank and ADB have maintained close coordination in both projects by informing each other of their
respective activities, and commenting on the design of the projects, in order to ensure the
complementarity of ADB and WB support in financial sector development.
Development partners are also endeavoring to help RGoB improve the effectiveness of public
spending. The Bank, IMF, and UNDP teams are supporting RGoB’s efforts to develop a sound multiyear fiscal framework and improve public expenditure management. Development partners are
working together to promote harmonization around the country’s national fiduciary and safeguard
systems. The Bank’s ongoing public financial management work has undertaken comparisons of
national and international public sector accounting and auditing standards, and is moving toward
alignment or adoption of international standards of accounting and auditing in a phased manner, using
an incremental approach, in collaboration with other donors, including ADB. To strengthen the
functioning of procurement systems in Bhutan, the Bank and Danida are collaborating on a series of
procurement reform measures, which include the development of the Procurement Manual, Standard
Bidding Documents, and a Policy Note on Grievance Mechanisms in Procurement, among other key
initiatives in this area. Over the last year, the ADB has been collaborating with the Bank’s
procurement team to further the united donor approach to support RGoB to modernize its public
procurement system.

52

A workshop to review progress under DPG1 & 2 was held in April 2008 and attended by the
representatives from all the major donors, and their inputs were reflected in the ICR. Additional donor
consultations to discuss the new DPG reforms were organized in October 2008.
E. Client Feedback
There was no Client Survey conducted during the CAS period. A close collaboration with the client
and the Bank’s flexibility was appreciated by RGoB.
F. Lessons for the Next CAS
Overall, the CAS outcomes have been achieved in a mostly satisfactory manner or are currently under
satisfactory implementation. Under the four Pillars, access to better infrastructure and social services
were expanded and communities were connected to markets, private sector development and
employment were promoted, PFM was strengthened and the cross cutting issues were addressed. On
an operational note, some indicators included while the CAS was being designed were not in any
project due to the changes in RGoB’s priorities resulting from new governance. There are several
broad lessons:


Capacity is a major issue constraining the RGoB’s reform efforts, and progress was strongest
where adequate capacity either already existed, or was mobilized as a part of the deepening
engagement in a given area (e.g. procurement).



Meaningful progress on key reforms was also easier when leveraged with investment projects
in related areas. This was evident in the case of Bank financing for private sector development,
education, procurement, and HIV/AIDS, which were developed in synergy with the three
budget support operations approved during the CAS period.



While attribution is difficult in several of the areas of policy and institutional reforms
supported by the CAS, effort is needed to identify suitable intermediate output and outcome
indicators. Past experience suggests that this can be constrained by lack of data in Bhutan.
Given short time horizons under operations, data on outcomes may not be available if they are
not collected frequently. One possible approach may be to indicate baseline indicators, note
subsequent developments without specific attribution, and articulate the causal relationship
expected. In cases where outcome targets are not readily quantifiable, or there are data
limitations, a compromise could be to identify qualitative progress indicators.



Understanding the poor’s socio-economic environment is the next important step for effective
policy planning. A joint analytical product such as a poverty assessment will be a vehicle to
enhance the level of understanding of poverty in Bhutan; it will engage the government and
enhance capacity.



At the sectoral level, coordination among ministries and agencies remains a challenge. A
number of line ministries have established, or are in the process of establishing M&E systems.
While there are obvious sector specific issues to be addressed, national planning and
monitoring would benefit from the standardization of a number of indicators across sectors.



Overall, the lack of external assessment made it harder to monitor the progress achieved
through the Bank-financed projects. No Client Survey was carried out to assess the client’s
satisfaction with the Bank’s support. The absence of a CAS Progress Report did not allow
having a general overview of the evolution of the outcomes contained in the FY06-09 CAS
Results Matrix. Including these analytical tools in the course of implementation of the FY1013 CAS is strongly recommended.

53



Due to the lack of a proper modernized procurement system in Bhutan, RGoB requested the
Bank to provide them with assistance to develop the sector in September 2005. Although
procurement may not have been included during the creation of the CAS, and hence no
indicators included to measure success, the Bank did consider procurement reforms to be
relevant and in line with the third pillar of the CAS and the cross cutting theme of good
governance. As already elaborated on above a reform program was put in place and significant
progress has been made to date. There are currently two grants that are under implementation,
which will continue to strengthen the national procurement system, namely, the Institutional
Capacity Building Project for Procurement and the PPPD Strengthening IDF. More work will
still need to be done on reforming the system in particular in the areas of complaints
mechanisms and developing electronic procurement. Additionally, Bhutan has been selected to
be one of the pilot countries for Use of Country Systems. It is therefore recommended that
procurement reform is included in the next CAS as well with specific indicators and goals
included.



Several TTLs have observed that due to limited resources allocated to supervise projects in
Bhutan, better donor coordination is critical in order to harmonize efforts made in several
sectors and to deliver better results.



IFC and the Bank Bhutan team have been working collaboratively to support the development
of the private sector. However, the Kingdom faces growing challenges in creating productive
employment opportunities for the educated and semi-skilled population. Support in skills
enhancement and employment generation will be critical in the next few years. The
nationwide enterprise survey conducted in FY09 provides useful data analysis for designing a
program of support aimed at employment generation in the next CAS.

Outcomes
1. Improve rural road
access and quality of
road network

Selected indicators (as of September 1st, 2009)

Moderately Satisfactory
-Reduction in travel time and transportation costs on rural access roads receiving Bank
support. Target: 50% reduction in transport costs and travel time. Actual value: 50-75%
reduction in transport costs and 75% reduction in travel time.
-Reduction in time taken to walk to motorable road by one half for targeted communities.
Target: 3400 beneficiary households within 1 to 3 days of walking to the nearest road head.
Actual value:3188 households.

Lessons Learned

Development of rural road network in Bhutan is expensive but
unavoidable to facilitate economic development and poverty
reduction. Impacts on most of the previously isolated rural
populations are positive and demand for accessibility is huge.
However, a better leveraging of the IDA resources would be
essential, as well as a better aid coordination among donors.

-Rural roads management and road practices improved Target: Wider acceptance of
environmental safeguards. Actual value: National Environmental Commission now
mandating EFRC application
2. Increase access to
adequate urban services
in Thimphu and
selected towns

Satisfactory



Most of the civil works were completed. However, the project
design should have included house connections for the water
component. The capacity of the dzongkhags in procurement,
financial management and monitoring remains weak, and the
project should have provided more TA from the very beginning.
Monitoring the results has been difficult because the M&E
capacities were non-existent.



In order to further expand both the quantity and the quality of the
teaching staff, more attention should be devoted to the selection
of candidates (not only on academic results), to the pass mark for
graduation (with 40% mark, all trainees graduate) and the
attribution of posts to new graduates (equitable distribution of the
best ones between rural and urban areas, primary and secondary)



Condom distribution and targeted condom promotion need
improvement. Efforts to reach out to most at risk groups has been
insufficient, in part because (a) there are no NGOs that could
more easily work with these populations, and (b) it is still unclear
who the risk groups are in Bhutan as they don’t follow the
pattern found elsewhere. A greater effort still needs to be made

-Satisfactory urban service delivery as confirmed by beneficiaries Target: 80% of citizens

sector development

Satisfactory



Given that the DPG program was multi-sectoral, it was difficult
to get individual donors into all components across the board but different donors picked up selected components and worked
with the Bank.



The design of the project was very good: While infrastructure
needed by the country is built, there is a strong ownership. The
technology transfer has been good and there is evidence that a
real activity is taking place at the local level. However, the
project timeframe was too short and an extension was necessary.



Adoption of international accounting and auditing standards is
quite typically a medium and long term reform and requires
substantial technical assistance and institutional capacity to be
achived with the CAS period

Annex 4: CPS Consultations
World Bank
Two rounds of in-country consultations with the Royal Government were carried out at the central and
district levels. Although at the time no Bank staff were permanently based in Bhutan, on the Bank side,
these consultations involved a number of sector colleagues who sought to participate and the presence of
the Country Director. This first round of in-country consultations at the central level took place in
September 2009. This included bilateral discussions with line ministries with which the World Bank
Group has existing program activities. Discussions were also held with the Ministry of Finance which
provided the Bank team with an overall framework in which the Bank-RGoB partnership program would
be configured vis-à-vis priority sectors, lending modalities (e.g. development policy operations, specific
investments, etc.) and notional sequencing of operations over the CPS period. This round of consultations
ended with a half-day’s round-table discussion involving director- and secretary-level RGoB officials as
well as the heads of policy and planning divisions. This seminar was held to present the CPS process and
solicit feedback on how the Bank’s support could be best placed.
Discussions were also held with the Gross National Happiness Commission (GNHC) which is
responsible for planning and coordinating development activities through bilateral partners and the United
Nations system. GNHC also carries out monitoring and evaluation of national development plan
activities.
A clear message from the first round of in-country consultations was that Bhutan is transitioning
quickly and a new set of challenges is emerging. Line ministries articulated sector-specific challenges
which they thought the Bank program could effectively address. The theme of youth unemployment and
the lack of opportunity for school leavers was a common thread in these discussions. A second key area
for which line ministries expressed the need for Bank support was in rural infrastructure, particularly
roads. The Bank team was informed during the course of nearly every discussion of the strong desire on
the part of the populace for expanded rural access. A key lesson from these discussions was the extent to
which decision-makers now seek to respond to the demands of the electorate under Bhutan’s new system
of democratic governance.
A second round of in-country consultations was held in December 2009 jointly with IFC to
consult with stakeholders at the municipal and district levels. This included a field visit to Bhutan’s
second largest urban center, Phuntsholing, to discuss urban development with municipal authorities, as
well as visit the country’s only industrial estate and hold discussions with private sector and para-statal
entities operating there. This round also included a full-day round table discussion in Chhukha
Dzongkhag which included the participation of all dzongkhag-level sector officers (e.g. agriculture,
education, health, engineering, administration and finance) and dzonghkag planning officers. On RGoB’s
part, the discussion was led by the Dzongdag (governor) of the district.
This round of discussion reinforced what the team heard at the central level, i.e. the importance of
addressing the growing problem of youth unemployment, shifting settlement patterns characterized by
increasing urban drift, and the importance of ensuring the provision of quality services and infrastructure,
especially access roads, to rural populations. One particularly enlightening, albeit startling, issue
discussed was the emergence of youth delinquency problem in secondary, peri-urban and/or dzongkhag
headquarter towns. This underscored the strong pull of youth from farms and villages upon the
completion of or during schooling.

62

Consultations were held with civil society through bilateral discussions with local civil society
organizations (e.g. Royal Society for the Protection of Nature, Worldwide Fund for Nature, Center for
Media and Democracy, etc.), as well as with representatives of the media. A press conference was held
after the second round of in-country consultations and wide media coverage followed, particularly
through a number of Bhutan’s newly established newspapers. Consultations were also held with
development partners through a presentation at a UNRC-chaired development partner forum. The World
Bank Group’s notional lending and AAA programs were outlined, as well as the process for CPS
preparation. A key lesson from these consultations was that civil society organizations would like to feel a
greater part of the development process and, to that end, sought engagement with the Bank in whatever
way possible. This includes regular consultations and information sharing. It also emerged from both civil
society and development partners that the World Bank Group’s analytical and technical expertise is
highly valued and important for helping define issues which other development partners seek to address.
After two rounds of in-country consultations with RGoB, civil society, development partners and
media, a series of meetings were held with the Department of Public Accounts, Ministry of Finance to
finalize the over-arching strategic framework for the CPS (i.e. areas of engagement, results clusters and
crossing cutting themes) and notional year-wise lending and AAA program. These discussions
underscored the importance to the Royal Government of budget support, and RGoB’s preference of using
specific investment credits for ‘hard core infrastructure’.
In July 2010, the Bank’s Managing Director (MD), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, made a three-day
visit to Bhutan. An audience was granted by His Majesty the King. Bilateral discussions were held with
the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Economic Affairs, and Foreign Secretary. Informal
discussions were also held with a limited number of development partners and the heads of constitutional
bodies (e.g. Anti-Corruption Commission, Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Auditor
General). Interactions during the MD’s visit highlighted Bhutan’s importance as a biodiversity hotspot
and potential carbon sink, its key role in the region for promoting wildlife conservation, and the
importance of establishing a mechanism for managing what will be increasing wealth through
hydropower revenues and as a means of mitigating risks to the economy from its heavy reliance on a
single commodity.
The establishment of the World Bank Group’s first country office has also afforded a number of
opportunities to engage the RGoB, private sector, development partners, civil society and media on the
challenges facing the country and the role of the World Bank Group as a development partner.
This series of consultations progressively built up a body of knowledge and understanding which
was sharpened and distilled at each stage. It also provided the World Bank Group team the chance to
better understand how the new system of democratic governance is functioning with newly defined roles
and responsibilities of various entities, both in RGoB and civil society, and the new challenges faced by
Bhutan as a result, in part, of its previous development success.
IFC
Given that this is a joint WB-IFC Bhutan CPS, IFC representatives have participated in joint
consultations with the Bank in Phuentsholing in November 2009, as well as participated in joint
consultation meetings with Ministry of Finance officials to discuss the CPS strategic pillars and potential
programs areas, both on the Investment and Advisory sides, that IFC could develop under the CPS.
Soon after the joint WB-IFC CPS process was initiated, Mr. Rashad Kaldany, IFC Vice President
responsible for regions, including South Asia, visited Bhutan in early December 2009. The VP was

63

accompanied by senior members of IFC regional management responsible for the Investment and
Advisory programs in Bhutan. During his visit, he hosted a luncheon with leaders from the private sector
representing key sectors, which included the financial sector, tourism, education and telecom, among
others, to discuss their views on the issues and challenges of the private sector taking an expanded role in
contributing to Bhutan’s national economic development. The VP held bilateral discussions with the
Finance Minister in order to better understand RGoB’s priorities and discuss how to align them with IFC
strategic priorities and areas of expertise. The VP paid a courtesy call on the Prime Minister to seek his
views on potential areas for IFC to engage in helping develop the private sector in Bhutan.
Following the VP’s visit to Bhutan, IFC had a number of subsequent missions by IFC sector
specialists in Financial Markets, Investment Climate and PPP Infrastructure. In early February 2010,
Financial Markets investment and Access to Finance (A2F) advisory teams conducted a joint mission to
Bhutan, meeting with the Royal Monetary Authority MD and Ministry of Finance to discuss the key
issues facing the financial sector in Bhutan and the impacts of the global financial crises on the financial
sector. The joint mission held separate meetings with the senior management of all four commercial
banks to discuss key issues and challenges facing the banks, especially since the number of banks had
doubled in 2010 (thereby increasing competition). The main purpose of the mission was to identify and
validate potential areas for IFC to focus on in devising its investment and advisory strategy for inclusion
in the CSP.
In addition to the mission to consult with relevant stakeholders in the financial sector, between
February and July, 2010, IFC’s Investment Climate (IC) team held numerous consultation meetings with
senior RGoB officials, BCCI leadership and member association representatives, plus other relevant
stakeholders to define and refine the strategy to take forward implementing the Regulatory Simplification
project in Bhutan. As a result of these consultations, the Regulatory Simplification will be the first
advisory project approved and implemented under the new Bhutan CPS. This has been factored into the
CPS and discussed with WB SASFP colleagues for potential collaboration.
Given RGoB’s priority to develop strategic infrastructure, Mr. Laurence Carter, Director, IFC’s
Advisory Services in Public-Private Partnerships, visited Bhutan in July 2010 to hold bilateral discussions
with Minister and Secretary of the Ministry of Information and Communication, the Finance Secretary,
Secretary GNHC, Executive Director Thimphu City Corporation and DHI. The purpose of this mission
was to share lessons learned from IFC’s global experience designing and implementing PPP structures to
develop infrastructure (e.g. solid waste management, hydropower projects) and deliver social services
(e.g. health, education) in this area, identify areas for IFC to build awareness around PPPs and identify
possible priority infrastructure projects that the RGoB could take forward on a PPP basis. IFC has
incorporated the comments and guidance received during these consultation meetings into the CPS.

Annex 5: Gender Mainstreaming in the Bhutan CPS
The Annex aims to inform the CPS with an understanding of gender issues. The vision for the
gender issues in the CPS is drawn from the cross-cutting theme of the 10FYP which features the theme of
women in development as an integral part of the country’s five-year plans. The 10FYP identifies that the
two key cross-cutting policy measures for gender equality are: (i) strengthening gender awareness and
sensitization at all levels; and (ii) improving information through collection, analysis and dissemination of
gender-disaggregated data. Given the commitment of RGoB, gender issues have been integrated into the
CPS.
Preliminary diagnostics of gender equality reveals that Bhutan performs remarkably well in terms
of gender equality, but many challenges remain. This annex explores key indicators on women’s status in
Bhutan—institutions, education, reproductive health, and participation in economic and governance. It
also links challenges with CPS activities.
Institutions and gender
Bhutan’s culture fosters gender equality. In terms of ownership rights, women in Bhutan enjoy
rights to financial autonomy. Matrilineal inheritance systems grant women access to land as well as
ownership. An estimated 60 per cent of rural women have land registered in their names and a majority of
Bhutanese women work in the agricultural sector.
Women enjoy equal access to productive resources and protection under the law. Bhutan is one of
the original signatories of CEDAW in 1980. Bhutanese inheritance law provides for equal rights for all
children, regardless of sex or age. Because of this general view of equality, however, the country has not
yet established specific laws to protect against the discrimination of women; some traditions and norms
continue to limit women’s roles.
Education and reproductive health status
Gender equality in basic education has been achieved, but challenges remain in higher education.
The ratio of female to male primary enrollment has reached roughly 100 percent in recent years. Equality
continues in the secondary education where the ratio of female to male enrollment is at 91 percent in
2006, similar to that of the Lower Middle Income countries. However, the gap widens considerably at the
tertiary level of education. Female students account only for about 50 - 60 percent of the number of males
at the university level, markedly lower than the South Asia average of 70 percent (DDP, World Bank).
On reproductive health, the coverage of antenatal care in Bhutan is high. The BLSS 2007 data
shows that, on average 88 percent of new mothers receive antenatal care. Even in rural areas, access is as
high as 86 percent of pregnant women. On this dimension, Bhutan performs better than the Lower Middle
Income Countries’ average of 83 percent (DDP, World Bank).
On the other hand, contraceptive prevalence is relatively low at 35 percent of women aged 15-49.
This figure is lower than the average for South Asia (53 percent) and of Lower Middle Income Countries
(65 percent). However, the story is more complete when considering the knowledge of modern
contraceptives. As many as 72 percent of reproductive age women have knowledge of modern
contraceptives, but decide not to use them. The overwhelming majority (83 percent) report that they do
not use contraceptives because they are not concerned. Most importantly, very few women respond that
they do not use contraceptives because of husbands’ objection (2.8 percent).

65

Women's participation in politics, government and business
Female labor force participation one of the MDG indicators. According to the Labor Force
Survey of 2009, labor force participation rate of women is almost as high as that of men (65 percent vs.
73 percent), while the South Asia average of female and male labor force participation rates are merely 37
percent and 82 percent, respectively (DDP, World Bank). According to the 2010 Investment Climate
Assessment (ICA), participation of women as business owners is twice as high compared to the regional
average and on par with OECD levels.
However, few women hold high ranking positions in government and the private sector. Only 10
percent of female workers hold jobs as regular paid employees, compared to 30 percent of male workers.
Women account for 48 percent of the labor market (LFS, 2009), yet make up only 31 percent of civil
servants. The share of women is even smaller at the top of the career ladder. Among executive level civil
servants, only seven percent are women (RCSC Statistics).
In the political arena, only 10 out of 72 members of Parliament are women; these can be divided
into four out of 47 in the National Assembly and 6 out of 25 in the National Council. Only one among
205 Gups (village heads) is a woman and there are no female Dzongdas (District Administrators).14
Conclusion and CPS activities
Bhutanese women are more fortunate than their peers in other South Asian countries insofar as
Bhutanese culture and social institutions provide a foundation for equality between men and women.
Such foundations appear to contribute to gender equality in basic education and labor force participation.
However, wide gender gaps can be found in many areas such as participation in the political arena. As
Bhutanese society is transforming, attention should be paid to opportunities for women in the future.
The CPS addresses gender issues both in the context of lending and non-lending activities. The
ICA report has sparked interest in gender issues vis-à-vis private sector development. These will be
addressed further in AAA and trust fund-supported activities. A piece of gender-informed Economic and
Sector Work will be conducted as a part of the Poverty Assessment AAA (as suggested in the Gender
Guidance note).15 Other possible AAA incorporating gender includes the Access to Finance TA, the
Higher Education Sector Note and the Urbanization and Growth Study. Gender issues are cross-cutting in
nature and will be addressed in a variety of sectors. Results on gender progress of sectors will be tracked
through gender-disaggregated and gender sensitive data which are increasingly available through support
by the World Bank Group and other development partners on survey and administrative data collection.
The CPS raises awareness on gender issues in Bhutan. Moreover, results of AAA activities on
gender can be used to showcase Bhutan as one of few developing countries where men and women are
quite equal. Therefore, it may offer a ‘success’ or ‘positive’ story overall.

Annex 7: Public and External Debt Dynamics16
1.
Background. Bhutan’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt declined to 59 percent of
GDP at end 2008/09, about 30 percentage points of GDP below its 2005/06 peak. The sharp decline in
public debt was driven by the completion of the Tala hydropower project that was financed by India,
which boosted economic output by 20 percent in 2007, and by the onset of the repayment of the
associated rupee debt. Reflecting the favorable fiscal outturns in recent years, domestic debt, all
denominated in local currency and held by domestic financial institutions, has also declined. External
debt, which accounts for more than 97 percent of total public debt, continues to be dominated by the
mostly Indian rupee-denominated hydropower sector debt (37 percent of GDP).
2.
Key Assumptions. The 2009 Joint IMF / World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) takes
into account Bhutan’s planned expansion in its power generation capacity, and looks at debt dynamics
over 2008/09-2029/30. In addition to the Punatsangchu I and Dagachu projects, included in the 2007
DSA, the baseline scenario incorporates two new hydropower projects, Punatsangchu II and Mangdechu.
Both projects will be financed by the Government of India (GoI) through a combination of loans and
grants. Similar to the spike in real GDP when Tala was commissioned in 2006/07, Punatsangchu I,
Mangdechu and Punatsangchu II will substantially boost economic growth as they come on stream in
2016/17, 2018/19 and 2019/20, respectively. In the interim, growth will be supported by the hydropower
construction activities and the commissioning of Dagachu in 2013/14. External financing for nonhydropower sector activities is expected to remain predominantly from multilateral and bilateral donors at
concessional terms.
3.
Outlook for External Debt. Bhutan’s external debt to GDP ratio will continue to trace the
cycles of the hydropower sector. The Present Value (PV) of external debt as a share of GDP is projected
to rise by over 40 percentage points between 2009/10 and 2014/15 to 110 percent, as disbursements for
new hydropower projects go up.17 The debt ratios remain above the Low Income Country – Debt
Sustainability Analysis (LIC-DSA) indicative threshold for strong policy performance countries until
2022/23 for the PV of external debt to GDP, and until 2017/18–2019/20 for the PV of external debt as a
share of exports and revenue. However, the commissioning of the new hydropower projects, which also
marks the start of the debt repayment, puts the debt ratios on a steady downward trajectory. The debt
service-to-export ratio is expected to remain below the indicative LIC-DSA thresholds for the entire
projection period. The debt service-to-revenue ratio may temporarily breach the indicative threshold as
Puna II and Mangdechu’s debt service begins; however, it is expected to remain below the threshold for
the rest of the projection period. The high level of foreign reserves, projected to average 10 months of
imports and 50 percent of GDP over the period when indicative thresholds are breached (i.e. 2009/102023/24), provides further cushion in the unlikely event of debt repayment difficulties. Sensitivity
analyses show that Bhutan’s external debt profile is sustainable under most alternative scenarios. While
the debt ratios are most vulnerable to exchange rate and export growth shocks, as well as unfavorable
financing terms, under almost all alternative scenarios considered, the debt ratios decline over time, and
eventually fall below the thresholds.
4.
Outlook for public debt. The public debt dynamics follows closely that of the external debt.
The PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise to 120 percent in 2014/15 until the commissioning

This section is based on a Joint IMF / World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis undertaken in 2009, for the IMF’s Bhutan –
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Staff Consultations, December 8, 2009.
17
The PV of external debt is calculated assuming the standard discount rate of 4 percent for both rupee and convertible currency
debt. Using a discount rate for rupee denominated debt of 11.25 percent in view of the higher inflation and risk-free long-term
interest rates in India, lowers the various PV of debt ratios substantially: the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 89 percent, while
the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio peaks at 430 percent in 2014/15. The PV of debt-to-exports ratio remains below the indicative
threshold.

of the new hydropower projects, and then rapidly decline until it reaches 15 percent of GDP by end
2029/30. In light of Bhutan’s strong economic performance, external financing is projected to shrink as a
share of GDP, making room for domestic financial markets to play a larger role in financing the
development agenda. Sensitivity analyses show that the public debt ratios remain on a declining path
over the long term under various stress tests. Not surprisingly, given the large share of external debt in
total public debt and the analysis above, overall public debt is most vulnerable to shocks to the exchange
rate. It will also be important to contain fiscal deficits to ensure the sustainability of public debt.
5.
Overall assessment. The DSA suggests moderate risk of debt distress over 2008/09–2029/30.
The policy-related LIC-DSA thresholds are breached for several indicators due to debt on account of
hydropower projects. However, these hydropower projects bring strong growth dividends, boosting the
average real GDP growth and exports. Sensitivity analyses show that the public debt profile is
sustainable under most scenarios, and the debt ratios decline over time and eventually fall below the LICDSA thresholds. Despite breach of thresholds in the initial period of the analysis, a rating of moderate
risk of debt distress is supported by: (i) Bhutan’s strong track record of project implementation; (ii)
commercial viability of new hydropower projects; and (iii) Bhutan’s close economic and political ties
with India which render minimal the commercial risks of these projects, as India is both the main provider
of financing for hydropower projects and the main consumer of the projects’ output.
