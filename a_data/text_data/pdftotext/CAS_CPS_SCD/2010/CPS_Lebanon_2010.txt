A long standing and sustained collaboration between the World Bank Group and the
Government of Lebanon shaped all stages of development of this Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS). The CPS benefited from extensive and thoughtful discussions with government
representatives and was also enriched by views from other partners in Lebanon – development
partners, civil society organizations, parliamentarians, political and civil leaders, academics and
representatives of the private sector – all of whom we warmly thank.
This Country Partnership Strategy was prepared under the guidance of Hedi Larbi,
Country Director, by a team led by Demba Ba, Country Manager for the World Bank in Lebanon
and Thomas Jacobs, Sr. Country Officer for the IFC. The CPS Core Team included: Sebnem
Akkaya, Lead Economist; Husam Beides, Sr. Energy Specialist; Mohammed Benouahi, Lead
Water and Sanitation Specialist; Mouna Couzi, Operations Analyst; Mona El-Chami, Sr.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR FY11-FY14
LEBANESE REPUBLIC
Executive Summary

1.
Lebanon’s economy has repeatedly proved its resilience to external shocks and its
ability to rebound quickly from crisis if political stability exists. But the need now is to put the
economy on a path to high, sustainable, and broad-based growth. Sustained high growth is vital
for Lebanon to improve its fiscal position and continue to move forward to achieve fiscal space
and debt sustainability, create jobs for the fast-growing educated labor force and support social
inclusion. Unique features of Lebanon’s confession-based political system and challenging
geopolitical environment have made it difficult for consecutive governments to implement
needed reforms, despite a shared understanding of which reforms are critical for growth.
2.
Lebanon’s key near-term policy challenge is to maintain a prudent approach to
economic management. The financial sector has prospered thus far despite the global financial
turmoil. But with high twin deficits and public debt, Lebanon remains vulnerable to external
shocks and has limited fiscal space. Given the substantial exposure of commercial banks to the
public debt, careful fiscal and debt management to maintain the confidence of domestic and
foreign depositors and investors remains critical. Continued prudent monetary policies are also
critical, for managing risks and buffering Lebanon from the effects of the global crisis.
3.
Over the medium-term, achieving high growth and employment creation requires
addressing the deeper structural economic determinants of growth and fiscal adjustment. The
resources currently invested in the government debt are unlikely to be made available for
productive investments while monetary policy continues to directly influence medium- to longterm interest rates. And the financial sector still lacks strong incentives to intermediate a large
share of its liabilities towards productive investments.
4.
The Policy Statement of the national unity government (in office since November 2009)
and the 2010 Budget Law reflect a strong will to put Lebanon back on a steady and
sustainable political and economic growth path. The Statement and the Budget Law identify
electricity, water, telecoms, urban transport, local development, environment, public education,
and social protection as priority focus areas in which reform and investment actions will
produce tangible results that will revive the country’s middle class, promote equity and fairness,
widen access to better quality and more affordable health care and education and; provide
adequate social safety nets for the most vulnerable. Success with these initial actions will create
favorable social and political space that the Government could use to tackle the deeper and more
difficult reforms that are needed to sustain development in these sectors and achieve broadbased growth.
5.
The World Bank Group’s (WBG) support to Lebanon over the past decade has focused
mainly on post-war reconstruction and on macro and fiscal recovery. The partnership has been
frequently jolted by political and security crises but it has been flexible and resilient, allowing
frank dialogue. The current IBRD portfolio consists of eight active projects for a total net
commitment of US$269.8 million, of which US$138.4 million has been disbursed to-date. It has
supported the reconstruction of critical infrastructure. Project implementation is generally

i

satisfactory and the disbursement ratio over the last three years has been above the three-year
average (FY08-FY10) for MENA and for the IBRD portfolio as a whole. IFC has played a key
complementary role and its committed portfolio has risen from US$38 million at the end of
FY05 to US$203 million as of June 2010. The donor community views the World Bank Group
as leading the engagement of Lebanon’s development partners to coordinate activities.
6.
Going forward, an effective country partnership strategy must be shaped by political
reality, able to respond flexibly to support reform when it does take place, and focused on
economic and fiscal management as well as social stability. Under the CPS for FY11-14, the
scope and degree of the World Bank Group’s support will be determined by the Government’s
willingness and ability to undertake reforms in areas that are seen to contribute to growth, fiscal
stability, and social cohesion.
7.
The main objective of the CPS is to support the Government in putting the economy on
a path to sustained, high, and broad-based economic growth. The Bank Group will continue to
support the Government with investment lending and analytical and advisory services, through
the existing loan portfolio, and through a new indicative lending envelope ranging between
US$375 and US$550 million assuming reasonable pacing and distribution over the four-year
CPS period. This lending and technical assistance will be complemented by IFC investments
and advisory services.
8.
In consideration of the country context and drawing from the lessons learned over the
ISN period, the CPS adopts a two-tiered approach: (i) maintain a Core Program of engagement
which consists of selected investments in basic services, as well as technical assistance and
analytical work that will serve to inform and build momentum around key reforms; and (ii)
stand ready to engage more deeply in additional areas that have been selected because of their
critical role in supporting Lebanon’s economic growth, fiscal and social stability, as well in
reinforcing economic and trade relations with the Gulf and the Mashreq. The CPS envisages to
engage in the areas of fiscal stability and public financial management, competitive business
environment, economic infrastructure, human capital development and social protection.
9.
The core CPS program will be assessed annually to determine the results achieved, and
the Bank Group will stand ready to engage more deeply in areas where there is traction for
reform. The criteria for moving to deeper engagement in a given area are: (i) there is sufficient
agreement within Government and among affected stakeholders on a well articulated policy
reform agenda; and (ii) the reform will have a positive impact on one or more of the following:
economic growth, fiscal space, and social inclusion. The Bank would be ready to provide budget
support through a general or sector-specific development policy loan if Lebanon implements a
sound macroeconomic framework and introduces a robust reform program that has a positive
impact on the fiscal situation.
10. There is a risk that narrow sectarian interests will continue to overshadow nationallevel interests and obstruct the implementation of the government’s newly adopted economic
reform program. This risk could be compounded if macroeconomic stresses develop as a result
of external shocks. Maintaining the World Bank Group’s analytical and advisory activities to
build capacity for reforms and to stimulate and inform the debate around policy options should
help build consensus around the reform program. Combined with continued strong engagement
by the Bank in the development and implementation of a social protection strategy, these
activities could provide an instrument to mitigate the risk.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR FY11-FY14
LEBANESE REPUBLIC

I.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

1.
Lebanon is a small, high-middle-income country of 4.2 million people with a large
diaspora of several millions, an area of 10,452 km2, and an average GDP per capita of around
US$7,000 in 2008. More than 85 percent of the population lives in cities, and about half lives in the
capital, Beirut. Youth below age 14 represent 25.8 percent of the population, while the active youth
(age 18-35) account for 31.8 percent of the population. The country has long been known not only
for its political instability but also for its talent in banking, education, and engineering and for its
open economy and liberal press. Though it has no natural resources it is one of the few countries in
the region with ample water resources and plentiful rainfall. Its service-based economy is driven by
a dynamic private sector and is highly dependent on the Arab Gulf economies with significant
linkages with the neighboring Mashreq economies in trade, labor, finance and real-estate. These
strong linkages highlight the potential benefits that Lebanon could obtain from increased regional
cooperation as promoted by the Arab World Initiative (AWI).
2.
The economy has many times proven its resilience to external shocks and its ability to
quickly rebound from crisis if political stability exists. Yet it is necessary during this Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) period to put the domestic economy on a path to high, sustainable and
broad-based growth that will create the necessary employment opportunities to meet the needs of a
fast growing educated labor force, and most importantly to achieve fiscal space and debt
sustainability. Unique features of the country’s confession-based political system and challenging
geopolitical environment have made it difficult for consecutive governments to implement reforms,
despite a shared understanding of which reforms are critical for economic growth.
A.

Political Context

3.
Lebanon is a sectarian-based consensual democracy in which political authority is shared
among confessional groups, with power divided largely between representatives of the Christian
and Muslim communities. The Taef Accord, which ended the Civil War in 1990, established a
system whereby the President, the Prime Minister, and the Speaker of the Parliament share power.
4.
The consensual nature of the country’s governance system render policy decision-making
lengthy and can create deadlock that has, in the past, derailed government’s drive for reform.
Lebanon also has a unique position in the region, and its domestic politics are complicated by
relations with external actors.
5.
The country’s complex political economy affects the quality of its public institutions of
policy making as well as its public institutions of services delivery, resulting in often low quality
services being provided by the public sector. As a consequence, citizens turn to, sometimes, more
costly alternative sources of service.
6.
Lack of capacity has emerged as another obstacle to reform in most sectors. In general, the
service delivery sectors are severely short in resources, especially skilled staff. The performance of

1

ministries and their capacity to deliver public services are therefore affected by the current staffing
policy.
7.
During the implementation period of the World Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN)—July
2007-June 2009—Lebanon’s political situation was very uncertain. The hostilities in July, 2006
had caused serious human and physical losses and significant damage to the economy,
jeopardizing national stability and ushering in a period of uncertainty. The International
Community responded rapidly, pledging US$7.6 billion in aid at the Paris III Donor Conference in
January, 2007. But not long after this Conference, and the adoption of the ISN to support
implementation of the Government’s Paris III reform program, the consensus for reform
evaporated and Lebanon experienced major political conflict. Political stalemate resulted in the
closure of Parliament, the withdrawal of the opposition from the Government, and an increase in
political violence. The resulting instability and insecurity affected activities throughout the
economy well into 2008.
8.
With the Doha Accords of May 2008, the settlement of Lebanon’s political crisis and the
ensuing improvement in security resolved much of the uncertainty. The formation of a
transitional coalition government ushered in a period of hope for a quick return of security and
political stability that paved the way to legislative elections on June 7, 2009. The polls resulted in a
victory for the March 14 political coalition, which led to the appointment of parliamentary majority
leader Saad Hariri as Prime Minister. Prime Minister Hariri formed a “National Unity”
Government in November 2009, following protracted negotiations with the opposition over the
distribution of key ministerial posts.
9.
Election debates of the economic platforms of the major political blocs revealed a
consensus that prudent fiscal policy, responsible debt management, and improved service
delivery to the people are critical for an inclusive and stable Lebanon. But while all political
groups in Lebanon agree on the importance and objectives of reforms, they differ on how to
reform, particularly with respect to the role that private sector should play in service sectors such as
telecommunications and utilities.
10. Because of the complexity of the political landscape in Lebanon and the inherent difficulty
of achieving consensus on reform and its implementation, an effective assistance strategy must
be shaped by political reality and able to respond flexibly to support reform when it does take
place. First-best solutions are not often feasible, given the political equilibrium, but any support
strategy should work towards economic and fiscal management as well as social stability. In the
coming period, the scope and degree of the World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) financial support will be
determined by the Government’s willingness and ability to undertake reforms in areas that are seen
to be contributing to growth, fiscal stability, and social cohesion.
B.

Social Context and Progress towards Millennium Development Goals

11. Regional disparities in living conditions are significant in Lebanon. Poverty is concentrated
in the suburbs of large cities and in remote rural areas especially in the northern region of Akkar,
which has been lagging behind the rest of the country; in this region, 80 percent of the population is
rural and as many as 63 percent of the families are deprived and face serious poverty. Overall,
nearly 28 percent of the Lebanese population (1 million) are considered to be poor, living on

2

US$4/day (Lebanon’s “upper poverty line”), and 8 percent (300,000 Lebanese) are considered
extremely poor, living on US$2.4/day (the “lower poverty line”).1
12. Uneven living standards across Lebanon’s regions reflect the absence of a regionally
balanced development strategy, coupled with differences in educational attainment and human
capital. Development efforts since the end of the Civil War have focused on post-conflict urban
reconstruction, while the northern region, mostly rural, houses 46 percent of the country’s
extremely poor. In addition, influences from external forces promote suspicions among the
population, and increase tensions in a country where the central government and state institutions
are fragile and inefficient, and most citizens turn instead to their religious, tribal, or ethnic
identities. Among Lebanon’s most vulnerable and excluded groups are the Palestinian refugees,
some 373,000, spread across 12 camps and other poor urban areas.
13. Compared with most other middle-income countries, Lebanon achieves relatively good
health and education outcomes. At around 72 years, life expectancy in Lebanon is comparable
with that in other middle-income countries. Infant and child mortality rates and the maternal
mortality rate are below the regional averages for the Middle East and North Africa. Lebanon
invests heavily in education, committing 13 percent of GDP for this purpose; 60 percent of this
investment comes from private funds. Secondary school enrollment rates are 13 points above the
regional average. However, weak institutional capacity and inefficiencies limit Lebanon’s
prospects of developing higher quality education and health services.
14. Though Lebanon invests heavily in human capital, it sees its best-trained people migrate
abroad or face low rates of return domestically. The unemployment rate is estimated at more than
7.9 percent in 2008. Nearly half the unemployed (48.4 percent) are young people aged 15-24.
Youth unemployment in Lebanon is estimated to be as high as the average for the Arab region
(roughly 26 percent), the highest in the world.
15. Young women have been affected worse than young men. Unemployment is higher among
women than men, at 9.6 percent compared to 7.7 percent (2004). 2 Though women are as educated
as men—the ratios of girls to boys in primary, secondary, and tertiary education are 0.97, 1.10, and
1.16, respectively—and the fertility rate is relatively low—at 2.2 births per woman3—women’s
labor force participation is low, at 37 percent, compared to the 55 percent average in other uppermiddle-income countries.4 On average, Lebanon’s female workers are more educated than male
workers, yet they experience wage discrimination, particularly at advanced employment levels, and
face more challenging working conditions than their male counterparts.5
16. In tracking the world’s progress towards achieving Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has suggested that Lebanon will
achieve most of the MDGs by 2015, except for three: (i) halving extreme poverty; (ii) reducing
child mortality; and (iii) reversing environmental degradation. For all the MDGs however, there
remain important regional disparities in access, quality, and efficiency.

C.

Economic Context

17. The Lebanese economy is a service-oriented economy that has a long-standing and
proactive trade tradition. Services and trade sectors account for 60 percent of GDP and 73 percent
of jobs; both sectors have a significant potential for growth. Led by tourism and financial
services—which are seen as the backbone of the Lebanese economy—the services sector alone
account for about 35 percent of GDP. Lebanon receives massive financial transfers and capital
inflows from abroad—net foreign inflows of services, capital, income and remittances reached 60
percent of GDP in 2009. Among the underlying reasons is the comparative advantage of the
Lebanese banking sector which is governed by bank secrecy and exhibited strong resilience to
adverse external shocks as well as internal political instability.
18. Lebanon’s growth and job creation performance has been below potential in the face of its
huge financial resources and overall improvement of key macroeconomic indicators over the last
decade. Most of these financial resources are consumed or unproductively invested, hence,
preventing the extension and modernization of productive capacities, and in turn, economic growth
and job creation. There has been moderate increase in investment which has been essentially
directed to the real estate sector, which has accounted for close to 70 percent of total investments
since 1997. Most of the remaining investments go to metallic industries that provide the
construction sector with intermediary goods. In turn, these sectors rely mostly on non-Lebanese
labor. Hence, concentration of investments in these sectors has little impact on the employment of
Lebanese nationals while channeling productive resources into activities where productivity gains
are potentially scarcer. Macroeconomic imbalances and related perceived risks (resulting in
relatively high interest rates), as well as many barriers reducing competitiveness and investment
opportunities are among the key factors that discourage longer-term productive investments in the
economy.
19. Lebanon is recognized for its human capital and the entrepreneurship skills of its citizens;
however it has traditionally faced significant migration and brain drain. With 54 percent gross
enrollment rate in tertiary education, Lebanon exceeds by far the 26 and 23 percent rate registered
respectively for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and for Middle-Income
Countries (MIC).6 However, human capital seems to be undervalued in the domestic labor market.
Gross private returns to education are low compared to international standards—an estimated 9
percent for Lebanon against 21 percent worldwide. This reflects low levels of productive
investments in sectors that demand skilled labor. Along with political instability, low returns for
education is a major factor behind the Lebanese brain drain. Migration is traditionally a large
phenomenon with the Lebanese Diaspora, considered to be one of the largest in the world in terms
of proportion to resident population. The Lebanese Diaspora has traditionally strong linkages to
their home country: Lebanon was the 7th largest country in the world in terms of the ratio of
incoming remittances to GDP in 2008 with 25 percent, making remittances inflows larger than
Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs). Remittances remained strong in 2009 at 20 percent of GDP.
20. The hostilities in the summer of 2006 resulted in serious human and physical losses and
caused a significant damage to the Lebanese economy. Though estimates vary, it is likely that
total direct damages were around US$2.8 billion, with a further US$700-800 million in indirect

6

World Bank’s World Development Indicators, 2009.

4

damage.7 Economic performance and employment has been severely affected with a significant
loss of output from the hostilities in 2006.
21. These events, however, have amplified the urgency of reform and donor response. In the
months following the hostilities and while addressing the urgent reconstruction and recovery
needs, the Government worked to adapt its medium-term economic program to the new
circumstances and presented it at the Paris III Donor Conference in January, 2007. The
program made an effort to balance fiscal measures needed for stabilization with structural measures
needed for higher growth. Donors responded favorably and generously to the program, pledging a
total of US$7.6 billion assistance, of which 76 percent were signed into agreements and about 52
percent disbursed by the end of May, 2010.
22. The reform efforts suffered a significant setback with a prolonged political impasse
through May 2008, but reconstruction and recovery progressed speedily. While the strong
recovery helped in containing the fiscal and public debt position, Lebanon’s fiscal deficit before
grants remains high (9.7 and 8.5 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively) and continues to
feed a very high public debt (148.0 percent of GDP in 2009). The majority of Lebanon’s public
debt (US$50.7 billion at end-2009) is held by private creditors, particularly by domestic
commercial banks holding 57 percent of public debt. The public debt is predominantly short-term
(about 46 percent is scheduled to mature by the end of 2011, and 21 percent by the end of 2010). It
is very probable that high interest rates linked to the public debt overhang do not encourage long
term productive investments. Unless Government financing needs strongly decline, investors
would continue to prefer to invest in highly remunerative short-maturity bonds. Significant levels
of new growth and fiscal effort are, in turn, required to stabilize Lebanon’s presently unfavorable
debt dynamics.

A.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, AND MACROECONOMIC
OUTLOOK

Recent Macroeconomic, Fiscal, and Financial Sector Developments

23. Despite the protracted political and security crisis and the adverse external economic
environment in the aftermath of the 2006 hostilities, the economy recovered at a much faster
pace than originally envisaged. Real growth rebounded to 7.5 percent in 2007 and 9.3 percent in
2008. Preliminary figures for 2009 show a real growth rate of 9.0 percent and estimation for 2010
is 8.0 percent. Although there was in 2009 some slowdown in foreign trade-in-goods and overall
transactions8 in the economy, reflecting the adverse impact of the global economic downturn, this
impact remained much more measured than originally envisaged, leading the Central Bank
(Banque du Liban- BdL) to revise the real GDP growth projections for 2009 up from 3 percent
expected early in the year. While the growth performance in 2007 is explained by a low base in
2006 (when real growth was 0.6 percent), the growth thereafter was supported by sustained strong
regional demand for Lebanon’s services and large inflows of transfers and capital (services exports
increased by about 38 percent in 2009 over and above the 44 percent increase registered in 2008,
and net inflows of services, income, transfers, and capital reached over 60 percent of GDP in
2009).
7

Over 1,000 people were killed, 5,000 were injured and close to one million (a quarter of the population) were internally
displaced. Additionally, brain drain accelerated as up to 200,000 people left the country.

24. Inflation decelerated in 2009, following the drop in international prices, which has
brought import costs down. Imported inflation in Lebanon has a strong impact on the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) since imports of goods amount to about 40 percent of domestic absorption. The
deceleration of prices was particularly prominent between April and October when the CPI
increased by only 2.1 percent on average (y-o-y)—the overall increase in the CPI remained low at
2.8 percent in 2009 compared to the 10.7 percent average increase in 20089. It should be noted that
the CPI index does not directly reflect trends in real estate prices, which, following a substantial
increase in 2008 (about 50 percent on average), remained high in 2009, reflecting strong capital
inflows, and persistent demand and supply in the sector.
25. The decline in international prices of commodities is having a positive impact on
Lebanon’s foreign accounts. The trade-in-goods deficit increased by only 0.8 percent in 2009 (yo-y) compared to 41 percent a year earlier, reflecting mainly the deceleration in imports. Exports
of services continued to improve in 2009 with tourism arrivals to Lebanon increasing by a
substantial 39 percent during this period. As a result, the current account deficit is estimated to
have declined to 15.5 percent in 2009 (from a high of 18.5 percent in 2008) and continues to be
easily financed by external inflows. Net foreign inflows of services, transfers, income and capital
reached US$20.7 billion in 2009, up from US$16.1 billion registered in 2008. Similarly, change in
net foreign assets reached US$7.9 billion, up from US$3.5 billion a year earlier. The continued
inflow of capital has helped to bolster the value of the Lebanese Pound (LBP) which is pegged to
the US dollar.
26. Lebanon’s financial market developments have been favorable despite the global financial
turmoil. Deposits and reserves have risen sharply since 2008. The money supply increased by
US$13.4 billion (39 percent of GDP) in 2009, out of which about 55 percent has been registered in
the second half of the year. Lending to the private sector remained strong, increasing by 15 percent
in 2009. This reflects the sharp increase in resources of commercial banks, as well as the increase
in incentives from BdL to promote lending in local currency. The incentive measures included
expansion in the sector coverage of the subsidy on interest rates,10 and exemptions on compulsory
reserves for loans denominated in local currency (LBP), excluding consumer loans and real estate
lending. Gross foreign currency reserves hit a new high of US$25.7 billion in December, 2009
(equivalent to about 19 months of imports of goods), up from US$17.1 billion in December, 2008.
The dynamic of reserves reflect both higher capital inflows and a shift by depositors out of dollars
into the local currency because of the interest rates advantage.11 Reflecting these developments, the
dollarization of deposits declined to 64.5 percent by December 2009 from 69.6 percent at end-2008
(77 percent at end-2007).

Since 2000, the BdL and the Government initiated schemes to promote lending to private sector investment operations.
These initiatives include subsidizing interest payments of the borrowers, extending special guarantees to the borrowers, and
granting exemptions on compulsory reserves of creditors. Initially focusing on projects in agriculture and industry, these
schemes were gradually expanded to include other sectors, such as ICT, environment/energy efficient projects, tourism and
housing. Although the special schemes exist also for loans denominated in foreign currencies, they are essentially directed
toward lending in LBP. All currencies taken together, these schemes are particularly developed in agriculture (84 percent of
total lending – mostly in LBP), tourism (70 percent), housing (59 percent – all in LBP), and industry (42 percent). Without
these schemes, some sectors, especially agriculture, would have been crowded out from the credit market. Also, with the sharp
rise in real-estate prices, these schemes are allowing access to housing by the resident middle-class.
11
With the sharp decline in the Libor, the spread between deposits in LBP and deposits in foreign currencies widened by
increasing from 271 basis points (bpt) in December 2007 to 389 bpt in December 2008 and remaining high thereafter at 370
bpt.

27. Strong growth and higher revenue collection checked the increase of fiscal deficit and
public debt ratio, but fiscal deficit remains high. Despite increased expenditures (as a result of
higher transfers to the Electricité du Liban (EdL), and wage and some non-wage benefits in the
public sector introduced in 2008 in response to a sharp increase in inflation), strong domestic
revenue collection helped contain the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) at around 9-10 percent of
GDP over the last two years. This brought faster improvement in the primary fiscal balance than
had been expected. These improvements partially checked the growth in debt which is estimated to
have declined to 148.0 percent in 2009 (see Table 1 below). However, high growth is the single
most important driver of the fast improvement in the debt ratio since 2007. Interest payments
remained high at around 11 percent of GDP during this period (about 46 percent of revenues),
continuing to feed the high public debt. The composition of debt changed between end-2008 and
December 2009, with an increase in the share of debt denominated in LBP to 58 percent of total
debt. The average interest rate on foreign currency debt slightly increased to 7.35 percent in
December 2009, up from 7.24 percent at end-2008 which reflects the exchange before maturity of
US$1.9 billion worth of debt against new issuances of Eurobonds at higher interest rates12 in early
2009. However, issuances of Eurobonds since December, 2009 are on rather favorable terms. In
March 2010, Lebanon issued US$1.2 billion worth of Eurobonds with a 10-year-maturity and a
coupon rate of 6.375 percent.13

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Prospects

28. The key near-term policy challenge for Lebanon is maintaining a prudent approach to
economic management. Lebanon’s financial sector has so far prospered despite the global
financial turmoil. However, with high twin deficits and public debt, Lebanon remains highly
vulnerable to confidence and external shocks and has limited fiscal space. Therefore, careful fiscal
management to maintain confidence of all (domestic and foreign) depositors and investors remains
critical for Lebanon’s economic prospects, given the substantial exposure of commercial banks to
12
The exchange was done in three issuances: two in US$ and one in Euro. One issuance in US$ is maturing in 2012 and has an
interest rate of 7.5 percent. The other issuance in US$ is maturing in 2017 and has an interest rate of 9 percent. The issuance in
Euro is also maturing in 2017 with an interest rate of 7.75 percent.
13
The Eurobond issue was managed by three Lebanese banks and subscribed essentially by domestic investors, including
banks. The proceeds of the operation were utilized for the redemption of the US$1.065 billion Eurobonds with a rate of 7.125
percent due in March, 2010.

the public debt. A stable political and security environment and continued prudent monetary
policies are also critical to managing risks – including security risks, both internal and those
stemming from regional tensions - and buffering Lebanon from the effects of the global crisis.
29. Over the medium-term, however, sustaining high growth rates will call for implementation
of key structural reforms. While fiscal adjustment is a necessary condition to improve Lebanon’s
long-term growth potential, it is not a sufficient one. Resources that are currently invested with the
government could be prevented from financing productive investments while monetary policy
continues to directly influence medium- to long-term interest rates, and the financial sector’s
incentives to intermediate a large share of its liabilities towards productive investments remain
weak. Unless Government financing needs strongly decline, investors will prefer to invest in highly
remunerative short-maturity bonds whose remuneration in US dollars is guaranteed by the
monetary policy in place since the mid-90s. Improving the performance of the country in terms of
growth and employment creation, however, requires addressing deeper structural economic causes
that will help create new growth and facilitate fiscal adjustment.
30. Bank staff projections for the medium-term (2011-2013) take into account the importance
of the external economic environment, political stability and evolving medium-term economic
program expressed in the Government’s Policy Statement. The base-case scenario assumes a
political environment that is conducive to decision-making, as well as the absence of major military
action related to regional tensions, and takes account of: (i) an expected gradual increase in oil
prices (and hence of regional oil wealth) and their impact on foreign inflows and growth; (ii) a
projected gradual recovery in growth—in the region and world-wide—and its impact on demand
for Lebanon’s exports of goods and services; (iii) government’s plan to increase public investments
in key service sectors (in particular, electricity, telecom, water and roads maintenance) over the
medium-term, financed essentially through a decline in primary surplus while new tax measures
(including long overdue increased taxation in the real estate sector and slightly higher taxes on
interest income), would start gradually bringing additional revenues over the longer run; and (iv)
government’s program to stimulate private investment and growth, including through improved
service delivery, and enhanced public-private-partnership (PPP).
31. The above assumptions combined with the current present favorable economic dynamics
and constructive political environment project an average 6 percent growth over the mediumterm. Available early indicators for the first half of 2010 point to continued good economic
performance over the near-term. Over the medium-term, the Government’s evolving economic
program suggests initiation of structural reforms (particularly energy, water, telecom and private
sector development) that would improve the business/investment environment, competition, the
entry and operation of Small- and Medium-Enterprises (SMEs), and service delivery, which
collectively would upgrade, to some degree, the long-term growth potential of the Lebanese
economy. Many of these reforms (particularly energy and telecom sector reforms) are considered
urgent by private sector representatives and will raise business confidence considerably. In the
medium-term, it is also expected that the flow of income transfers, remittances, Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI), and portfolio investments into Lebanon will remain favorable (albeit at rates
closer to historical averages) due to the gradual rise in oil prices, as well as the positive response of
domestic private investment to the Banque du Liban incentives summarized above (given higher
reserves and lower inflation) and overall improved business confidence in Lebanon’s economic
prospects. These factors would collectively help stimulate growth and reduce interest rate spreads,
thereby helping offset the negative short-term impact of gradual fiscal consolidation on aggregate
demand. Based on these factors, we expect real GDP growth to converge to a higher trend growth

8

of about 6 percent on average in the medium-term along with an improvement in the public debt
ratio (see Table 1).

32. The twin deficits are expected to slowly improve during the projection period. The current
account deficit in 2009 was lower at 15.5 percent of GDP (compared to over 18.5 percent of GDP
in 2008), and it is projected to continue to slightly improve through 2013. Reflecting the
Government approved plan for improving the performance of the electricity sector, transfers and
subsidies would decline moderately starting in 2011. In parallel, public investment will be higher to
address, in particular, supply deficiencies in the electricity and water sectors, and to upgrade
telecom services and roads. The Government also maintains emphasis on improving the
effectiveness of expenditure management as a whole. Tax revenues are expected to remain robust
with the impact of the rise in direct taxes gradually materializing in the longer run. Non-tax
revenues – essentially transfers from the Telecom sector – are expected to remain constant in
percent to GDP. Accordingly, 2010 budget expenditures are estimated to remain high at 32.9
percent of GDP, and the primary surplus before grants is projected to be squeezed down to around
1 percent of GDP in 2011 before starting to recover in 2012. The ratio of revenues to GDP is
projected to remain stable and the debt to GDP ratio is expected to continue to gradually improve
in 2010-2013.

9

33. On the financing side, Lebanon has recently resumed borrowing in foreign currencies.
The abundance of liquidity in domestic currency, particularly since the onset of the global
financial crisis, has led the Government to opt for increasing net financing from domestic
sources in domestic currency. Indeed, the share of Lebanese Commercial Banks in the debt
portfolio increased to 56.7 percent in December, 2009 from 54 percent in December, 2008, and the
share of the Central Bank increased to 13.4 percent from 11.9 percent. The financing from these
two sources was mainly in domestic currencies. In 2010, the Government has so far continued
financing the deficit by issuing LBP-denominated Treasury Bills (TBs) and resumed the issuance
of Foreign Currency-denominated debt. The new Eurobonds issuances are re-equilibrating the
composition of debt towards the legal ceiling of 50 percent of foreign currency-denominated debt,
taking advantage of the low interest rates in the international market. In addition, low cost,
concessional foreign debt financing also remains available subject to accelerated structural reforms,
with a large portion of Paris III pledges remaining undisbursed (52 percent including funds tied to
structural reforms).
34. The costs of divergence from a solid reform route are high. The medium-term reform
scenario suggests that even with fiscal adjustment (with 1.6 percentage points of GDP lower fiscal
deficits between 2009 and 2013) and a fairly positive growth response in the medium-term, debt
will remain high (124 percent of GDP in 2013), largely because of the continued high cost of
servicing the large debt stock (see Table 2 above). In the event of a weak policy response and a
deteriorating internal and/or external political environment, and/or unfavorable external shocks,
Lebanon’s growth potential would remain repressed (on average at around its historical trend rate
of 3.5 percent for the period 1993-2006) due to a lack of profitable business opportunities, weak
external competitiveness and low levels of business confidence in economic prospects. Primary
public spending in terms of GDP would also remain at its historical average, and interest payments
in terms of GDP would remain high. In such a low growth scenario, the fiscal deficit would remain
unsustainably high (at double digit levels in terms of GDP), and the debt-to-GDP ratio would grow
back to the high level experienced just a few years ago. This would inevitably further expose the
country to a risk of financial disruption, should investors, holding the vast majority of Lebanon’s
debt, lose confidence in the country’s debt servicing capacity.
III.

LEBANON’S PRIORITIES AND AGENDA FOR DEVELOPMENT

35. At the Paris III Conference in January 2007, Lebanon presented its “Reconstruction,
Recovery, and Reform” Program for 2007 to 2011. This medium-term structural reform program
consisted of six main pillars: (i) economic revival; (ii) social sector reform; (iii) macro-fiscal
reform; (iv) privatization; (v) recovery and reconstruction; and (vi) budget support. Thirty-eight
donors and institutions pledged about US$7.6 billion in support of the program (equivalent to one
third of Lebanon’s GDP). About 52 percent of this amount had been disbursed by end-May 2010.
36. Though reconstruction and recovery progressed speedily, the apparent consensus on the
reform agenda quickly dissolved and little, if any, progress was made on reforms. A political
crisis emerged, lasting for about 18 months and leading to the formation in September, 2008 of a
transitional government until the parliamentary elections in June, 2009.
37. The new Government, in office since November 2009, established its program “Progress
and Development” (ESP) as a cornerstone for its policy statement to Parliament. The ESP

10

embodies the economic and social development platform of the national unity Government and
reflects a strong will to put Lebanon back on a steady and sustainable political and economic
growth path. The ESP seeks to: (i) revive the country’s middle class through job creation and better
distribution of wealth, for example: by broadening ownership of real estate and improving access to
economic infrastructure; (ii) improve the quality of Lebanese life through better safeguarding the
environment, widening access to better quality and more affordable health care and education, and
providing adequate social safety nets for the most vulnerable; and (iii) promote equity and fairness
through broadly-based growth, narrower regional disparities, reduced gender disparities, reliance
on the rule of law, and good governance to restore the credibility of state institutions.
38. To achieve these objectives, the ESP calls for leveraging the framework that Paris III
provides to implement a national program, including a set of well-targeted structural reforms
and investments for enabling growth: (i) sound fiscal management that provides a sustainable
macroeconomic framework while offering fiscal space to offer adequate social and infrastructure
services and social safety nets for the most vulnerable people; (ii) a modernized, effective, and
strong public administration; (iii) adequate physical infrastructure, especially for utilities and
transport; (iv) an appropriate regulation and risk-sharing framework for effective private
participation in the economy, particularly in telecoms services; and (v) adequate social protection
services and an education system whose planning and production are matched to the demand for
skills in the domestic and global labor market. The ESP also recognizes the need to pay special
attention to the challenges posed by environmental degradation and gender imbalances and to
leverage existing economic and sector work in these two areas to fast-track reforms.
39. The Government has identified electricity, water, telecoms, urban transport, local
development, environment, public education and social protection as priority focus areas in
which immediate reform and investment actions will produce tangible results toward meeting the
pressing needs of the population. Success with these initial actions would create favorable social
and political space that the Government could use to tackle the deeper and more difficult reforms
that are essential for putting these sectors on a sustainable development path and the economy on a
sustainable broad-based growth.


Electric power: The Cabinet has adopted in June, 2010, a Policy Note and an Action
Plan to reform the power sector in order to provide continuous and cost-effective
electric power to all citizens and productive sectors. The Plan seeks to increase in the
short-term generation capacity by at least 600 MW, as well as implement energyefficiency and savings programs, thus preparing the ground for deeper reforms of
tariff and sector management and governance. The Plan also aims to implement strict
bill collection measures through the private sector and will encourage energy
conservation, the use of clean technologies, and renewable energy resources such as
solar power.



Water supply: The Government is seeking to improve access to water and the
continuity of water supply to fulfill the increasing demand, by improving water
distribution and conservation and completing the water infrastructure of the Greater
Beirut Regional Water Authorities. It also seeks to rationalize water consumption and
to promote the preservation of water resources. With regard to wastewater, the
Government aims to stop the contamination of groundwater, improve the operation of
existing treatment sites, and accelerate the construction of new sites to protect the
natural resources.

11



Telecommunications: The Government seeks to modernize the infrastructure and
regulatory framework so the sector can provide modern and cost-effective
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) services with the aim of
stimulating private sector led economic growth. It plans to expand the penetration
rate and to tackle gaps in the quality and range of service through the extension of
broadband services and private sector participation in the provision of
telecommunication services and related business.



Urban transport: The Government seeks to improve public transport to facilitate the
movement of citizens and to reduce transport costs and delays. It will launch a
national plan for public transport services and establish traffic control centers, install
more traffic signals, and firm up the punitive measures for traffic violations.



Local development: In response to sustained urbanization the Government recently
adopted the National Land Use Master Plan which provides the framework for a more
balanced territorial development promoting social cohesion while building on the fast
growing tourism sector potential and using the exceptionally rich historical and
cultural heritage assets of the country for economic development.



Environment: The Government envisages actions to encourage the use of clean
energy and renewable energy, along with adopting sustainable management policies
for solid waste, wastewater, water, and reforestation programs.



Education: The Government objectives are to improve the quality of public
education by expanding access to early childhood education, reducing dropout and
repetition rates, enhancing the qualifications and performance of the teaching
workforce, adopting school-based planning, development and improvement,
establishing a National Qualifications Framework which will link the various
education levels to the labor market, and introducing quality assurance at the higher
education level.



Social protection: The Government intends to accelerate the implementation of
reforms that were started under Paris III, the most critical of which are: the
introduction of the new pension law, which replaces the ill-functioning End-of
Service Indemnity (EOSI) system with a defined-contribution, fully-funded pension
system; improving the financial sustainability of the National Social Security Fund
(NSSF), as well as, the quality and efficiency of its services and operations; and the
expansion and rationalization of health insurance within a unified framework.



Labor Markets: In the area of employment and labor market policies, the
Government defined an ambitious program which includes developing a framework
for effective Active Labor Market Policies and Programs (ALMPs), particularly for
youth and gender inclusion; modernizing labor market policies including related
regulations; developing income protection mechanisms for workers (such as
unemployment insurance); and strengthening the Ministry of Labor’s capacity to lead
the reform process and its implementation. In the area of social safety nets, the
Government intends to implement a nation-wide program of targeted social assistance
through the National Poverty Targeting Program (NPTP).

IV.

A.

THE WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

Nature of the Partnership

40. The World Bank Group and Lebanon have built a strong partnership that has enabled frank
and substantive discussion about the country’s development challenges, as well as, about the
political economy and its impact on the Government’s ability to implement reforms. Over the past
decade the framework for the Bank Group’s support has focused primarily on post-war
reconstruction and on macro and fiscal recovery. The partnership has been frequently jolted by
political and security crises linked to the unique features of Lebanon’s political system and
geographic location.
41. The experience over the past five years highlights the Bank Group’s ability to be flexible
and to respond to unanticipated changes in the country’s circumstances and needs. Following
the 2006 hostilities, the Bank acted quickly to help assess the extent of the damage and the scope of
Lebanon’s reconstruction needs and to assist in the reconstruction of basic municipal and urban
infrastructure. It also played an important role in supporting the fiscal and structural reforms of the
Government’s Paris III agenda, including through emergency support to the budget. The ISN set
out a 15-month transitional framework of technical and financial assistance to support the
Government’s efforts to create reform momentum, paving the way for broadening and deepening
these reforms as the political environment stabilized. Through these actions, the Bank also helped
lay the foundation for an effective and more inclusive social safety net, better public financial
management, and increased private sector development.
42. Similarly, IFC was quick to engage with the Bank in supporting the recovery of the
private sector. During this period, IFC opened a Country Office in Beirut (co-located with the
Bank) and significantly scaled-up its activities in Lebanon.
IFC exceeded its Paris
III/Reconstruction pledge of US$250-275 million, having committed almost US$770 million since
the end of the 2006 conflict and through June 30, 2010. During this period, IFC’s investment and
Advisory Services emphasized: (i) increasing access to financial services for SMEs and trade
finance activities; (ii) easing administrative constraints; (iii) promoting improved corporate
governance; and (iv) improving competitiveness and facilitating greater private investments.
Coordination between the Bank and IFC has continued to strengthen, leading to this first joint CPS
for Lebanon.
43. Because of the continuous frank dialogue that the Bank has enjoyed with Lebanon over
the last decade, as well as its track record in responding effectively to Lebanon’s requests for
assistance, the WBG is now well placed to engage the GoL in a partnership that seeks to achieve
sustainable, broad-based, high economic growth, which is central to moving the Lebanese economy
from the current high-risk equilibrium to a more sustainable fiscal and debt equilibrium. This CPS
also recognizes that the Lebanese economy is among the most linked with the Mashreq and GCC
economies; and hence the Bank Group will support the GoL in adopting a proactive regional
integration approach to addressing some of its key development challenges in areas such as:
electricity, trade, labor, and finance, while remaining cognizant of the challenges posed by the geopolitical environment in the region, especially with regard to security.
44. Recognizing that women’s economic activity can play an important role in Lebanon’s
productivity and economic growth, and given the multidimensional factors that affect the choices
that they make, the WBG will pursue a gender-integrated approach, including monitoring of key

13

gender indicators in selected areas of WBG intervention (human capital development and social
protection; business environment and SMEs; and infrastructure).

B.

Implementation of the ISN and Lessons Learned

45. The ISN was prepared in the aftermath of the summer 2006 hostilities and the ensuing
political impasse which had rendered some of the CAS (approved in December, 2005)
assumptions and projections untenable. The ISN was designed to support the Government’s
medium-term structural reform program - Paris III - discussed at the International Donor
Conference in January, 2007. However, implementing this ambitious program required broad
political support and consensus on key reforms, which proved to be short-lived as a political crisis
emerged, lasting about 18 months and leading to the formation of a care-taker government until the
parliamentary elections of June, 2009. As such, while the ISN priorities were fully aligned with
Lebanon’s own priorities, the design of the strategy was generally appropriate to the challenging
country circumstances, and the quality of the portfolio has shown considerable improvement over
the period, implementation of the reform program itself has been slow.
46. The portfolio currently consists of eight active Bank projects for a total net commitment of
US$269.8 million, of which US$138.4 million has been disbursed to-date. These projects have
been financed by a mix of IBRD (US$209.7 million) and the Lebanon Trust Fund (US$60 million).
The latter was created with a transfer from IBRD net income in September 2006, following the
summer 2006 hostilities. In addition, Lebanon has been able to access a variety of existing Bankadministered trust funds, including Institutional Development fund grants, Development Grant
Facility grants, Cities Alliance grants, Persistent Organic Pollutants and grants from the State and
Peace-Building Fund.14 The current portfolio includes seven of these grants, totaling US$3.4
million. The portfolio has supported the post-war reconstruction of critical infrastructure
(especially in the areas of water supply and sanitation, urban transportation, and urban
development) and the strengthening of capacity in public institutions in need of reform (in
electricity, social protection, and fiscal management). It is worth noting that trust funds have
played a central role in the World Bank’s support to Lebanon and have been instrumental in the
preparation of structural reforms under the ISN and Paris III. This support was also bundled with
IFC investments to facilitate bank lending to SMEs affected by the conflict through advisory
support and risk guarantees. Trust funds have also been used to support the reconstruction of the
Nahr El-Bared camp and its adjacent communities. In addition to the US$2 million grant from the
Development Grant Facility, which is financing small-scale infrastructure projects and services for
the communities surrounding Nahr El-Bared, the Bank has set-up a Multi-Donor Trust Fund
(MDTF) which channels donor contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA) for the reconstruction packages for the old camp and has been fully disbursed.
47. Project implementation is generally satisfactory. With an average disbursement ratio of
27percent over the last three years (FY08-FY10), Lebanon’s portfolio has performed better in this
regard than MENA (21percent disbursement ratio) and the IBRD portfolio as a whole (25percent
disbursement ratio). While all projects are expected to achieve their development objectives, the
sustainability of the outcomes will continue to depend on the implementation of sector reforms and
sufficient expenditure on maintenance.

14

For a complete list of Trust Funds, see Annex 2.

14

48. The Bank has also produced and disseminated a number of pieces of analytical work and
just-in-time policy notes that have shaped policy debates and provided policy advice and
analytical underpinning for reform, namely in electric power, water, education, agriculture,
broadband deployment strategy, pensions, labor markets, investment climate, gender, and
environmental management (see Annex B4 for the complete list).
49. IFC’s program in Lebanon has grown significantly over recent years, with the committed
portfolio increasing from only US$38 million at the end of FY05 to US$203 million through June
2010. IFC has played a key complementary role to IBRD in Lebanon, having committed almost
US$770 million since August 2006, as part of the WBG response to Paris III. More than US$580
million of this was provided in trade finance through guarantees provided to Lebanese banks under
IFC’s Global Trade Finance Program. IFC commitments, via a variety of equity, debt, and
guarantee instruments, included more than US$150 million for local banks to lend to smaller
businesses. This was facilitated by a US$15 million grant from IBRD that, in part, was used to
support risk participation agreements by IFC to encourage bank lending to the SME sector. In
2010, IFC invested US$100 million in equity in Byblos Bank to help in its local and regional
expansion. Building on its achievements during the ISN period and in line with the renewed
commitment to the Arab World Initiative, IFC aims to support the regional expansion of Lebanese
real sector firms, while continuing to support increased access to finance for small- and mediumenterprises. A focus on equity transactions, the energy sector, and the environment are expected to
be core to IFC’s program during the period of the CPS.
50. Reflecting back on the ISN implementation period, a number of key lessons can be drawn
around the need for realism and flexibility in the Bank Group’s support to Lebanon. Specifically:
(i) the complexity of the political environment for decision making in Lebanon should not be
underestimated; (ii) it is helpful to establish a flexible framework of activities that can be scaled up
or down according to progress made on the reform program; (iii) it is important to set realistic
objectives; and (iv) simple project design and the use of adaptable instruments are necessary to be
able to respond flexibly to challenges and changing priorities.

C.

Consultation Process

51. Together with the IFC, the Bank embarked on broad consultations at the start of the CPS
process, seeking to achieve a wide consensus from Lebanon’s highly politicized and diverse
stakeholders. The consultations involved: (i) rival political groups, including parliamentarians; (ii)
public institutions; (iii) the donor community; (iv) the private sector; and (v) NGOs, academicians,
and representatives of the civil society at large. These consultations helped to consolidate the focus
and scope of the CPS draft. They also reinforced the Bank Group’s growing image in Lebanon as a
“Knowledge Bank,” judging from the participants’ feedback, and garnered wide support for the
institution’s Access to Information Policy.
52. Political parties and public officials show a reasonable level of agreement on the reform
priorities outlined in the GoL’s priority Action Plan, but they differ over the implementation
options. Their differences are clearly shaped by political interests.
53. Lebanon’s private sector sees the need to improve the business environment to encourage
investment and job creation and curb brain drain. Some key complaints of the private sector
include the country’s inadequate infrastructure and the weak enforcement of laws, especially

15

commercial laws, which undermines investor confidence. More support for SMEs is needed as a
way to reduce the migration of skills.
54. The civil society organizations display a clear lack of confidence in the state and its
institutions under the existing consensual power-sharing formula. They voiced strong support for
a Bank role in facilitating agreement on some of the less controversial reforms, such as in the
electricity and water sectors, and cautioned against an ambitious strategy that would be undermined
by the prevailing political economy.
55. The donor community views the Bank as leading the engagement of Lebanon’s
development partners to coordinate activities. The political economy issues and the historical
context of the policy reform challenges should be further discussed within the donor community
given Lebanon’s unique political equilibrium.

D.

Strategic Objectives of the CPS

56. The main objective of the CPS is to support the GoL in putting the Lebanese economy on a
path to sustained, high and broad-based economic growth which is critical for Lebanon to
continue to improve its fiscal and debt sustainability; create employment; provide adequate
infrastructure and social services and support social inclusion.
57. Achieving growth and employment creation requires addressing deeper, structural,
economic determinants of growth and fiscal adjustment. To this effect, the shared strategy
between the Government of Lebanon and the World Bank Group consists of focusing CPS support
on a set of well-targeted and reinforced structural reforms and investments, which will create the
following enablers of high economic growth:
i. Economic management that furthers fiscal and macroeconomic stability;
ii. An improved business environment with appropriate regulation and risk sharing
frameworks for effective and increased private investments in the real economy;
iii. Adequate provision of cost-effective infrastructure services, especially in: electricity,
water and transport, with adequate regard to local development, environment, and
competitiveness of factor costs; and
iv. A public education system for which production and quality meet domestic and
global labor market demand, as well as, an expanded and effective social protection
system for the population at large, including robust labor market policies and
programs targeting vulnerable youth and women.
58. Recognizing the dependence of the Lebanese economy on the region’s economies and the
potential benefit of deeper economic integration, the CPS will include support to promote
economic integration through a number of potential regional projects, including: cross-border trade
facilitation and infrastructure to reduce trade transaction costs and increase competitiveness; energy
interconnection and a regulatory framework for a regional energy market; and the harmonization of
business regulations in the region to promote private sector investment, capital flows and regional
competitiveness.
59. Furthermore, both the GoL and the WBG acknowledge that the frail application of
principles of good governance remains one of the key challenges that restrain the potential for
growth in the public and private sectors. Lebanon has credible and well established institutions on

16

the demand side of good governance (a free press, a strong civil society, parliament, academic
think tanks, etc.). The country, on the other hand, suffers a shortage of public institutions capable
of formulating good public policy and of producing and delivering public goods. This has led to
lack of transparency and accountability in the public sector as well as difficulty in enforcing laws,
regulations and judicial decisions. As a result, public sector institutions are avoided by much of
the population when possible, and parallel mechanisms have emerged to fill the gap in service
delivery; the public no longer expects quality services from public institutions and has ceased to
hold the government accountable for the failure to deliver. The CPS supports the GoL’s strategy
for improved governance throughout the four areas of engagement, specifically, public finance
management reform, business environment reform, corporate governance reform of EdL and
Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (CNSS). Should the Government initiate a more
comprehensive program, beyond what it is already undertaking under the sector reform programs,
the WBG will provide the knowledge and financial services it needs to implement a comprehensive
good governance program.

17

Box 1: Governance, Anti-Corruption and Service Delivery Challenges within
Lebanon’s Complex Political Economy
Lebanon is faced with substantial governance challenges and a complex political economy which not only
affects the quality of governance but can also limit the impact of development assistance. The Bank
undertook a Country Governance and Anti-Corruption analysis (CGAC), a Social Impact Analysis of the
Electricity and Water sectors, and a review of Lebanon’s political economy to identify governance-related
risks on a sectoral level as well as entry points to mitigate these risks.
Towards this end, governance stocktaking notes were prepared in three sectoral areas: electricity, water,
and social protection. The studies provided evidence that the political interests and the socioeconomic
interests of dominant political and economic groups often converge and influence public decision-making,
resulting in low-quality services being provided by the public sector. Power generation, water and social
protection have been particularly vulnerable to this dynamic.
The Social Impact Analysis of the Electricity and Water sector provided evidence on how different
households, specifically the poor, were severely affected by governance weaknesses. It demonstrated that
the malfunctioning of these sectors contributed to poverty because the financial burden of expensive and
ineffective water and electricity services, coupled by insufficient supply, has been carried by the
consumers.
The political economy analysis suggested on a general level that reform practices that might seem ideal
from a technical point of view may not be feasible in Lebanon’s historical and institutional setting and
therefore require flexible adjustments of the reforms. Moreover, reform will be difficult unless it is
balanced among all stakeholders and supported through broadly based communication and participation
across sectarian lines.
The preparation of the CPS has been informed by the existing analysis and applies flexibility to customize
the Bank Group’s engagement strategy to the political realities of Lebanon. The strategy focuses support
on areas where the policy and institutional environment are conducive to effective engagement and
development results and stands ready to respond to opportunities in areas where development initiative is
either politically not feasible or technically not ready. In addition, the CPS promotes stronger
accountability and enhanced transparency by emphasizing reliance on domestic accountability mechanisms
such as: 1) strengthening of internal audit and controls within line ministries; 2) promoting the inclusion of
social accountability and complaints-handling measures within projects; and 3) sharpening the terms of
reference of external audits to be more focused on detecting fraud and corruption. Also related to the
governance agenda are the efforts to improve accountability and transparency in the private sector (private
sector accounting and auditing standards and professional accreditation).

E.

CPS Principles of Engagement (Two-Tiered Approach)

60. Because of Lebanon’s complex political economy, it is difficult to foresee where reforms
are most likely to take place. However, it is possible, through well selected World Bank Group
ESW, TA, and Advisory Services, targeted investments and close policy dialogue, to develop
solutions that will help move the reform agenda forward. In consideration of the country context
and drawing from the lessons learned over the ISN period, it is proposed to adopt a two-tiered
approach: (i) maintain a Core Program of engagement which consists of selected investments in
basic services, as well as technical assistance and analytical work that will serve to inform and
build momentum around key reforms; and (ii) stand ready to engage more deeply in additional

18

areas where there is traction for reform. Selectivity has been applied in determining the areas of
intervention of the CPS, that is, where the reform is anticipated to strengthen growth potential,
increase fiscal stability and enhance social equity. Progress on implementation of the Core Program
will be assessed on a frequent basis (annually) to determine the results achieved, and the GoL and
Bank Group will jointly agree on areas for possible scale-up of WBG engagement. These
consultations will provide the framework and the basis for moving from Tier I to Tier II.
Tier I- Core Program
61. Under the Core Program, the Bank Group will continue to support the Government
through the existing portfolio, which includes Specific Investment Loans (SILs) and Trust Funds
(TFs) in energy, water, transport, municipal and urban development, social protection, and fiscal
management, as well as IFC’s investment and Advisory Services (see Annex 2: World Bank
Portfolio Performance). Going forward, new activities will be added to the Core Program on a
selective basis with a view to strengthening the momentum for key reforms that are needed for
growth, fiscal stability and social inclusion. These new activities can take the form of selected
knowledge services (ESW, just-in-time technical assistance and IFC Advisory Services) or targeted
investment support in critical areas identified as binding constraints to growth.
62. In addition, because fiscal and debt sustainability is central to sustained high growth, the
Core Program will focus on providing technical assistance in public finance management and fiscal
consolidation as well as in statistical capacity building. The Core Program will also include
technical assistance to enhance employment and labor market policies with particular focus on
policies that aim to improve women’s access to job opportunities. Advisory Services and
investments will be provided in support of regional integration and business environment in
partnership with IFC. IFC will pursue private sector investments and Advisory Services with a
focus on priority areas such as sustainable energy, development of SMEs, and private provision of
health, education and infrastructure services.
Criteria for Moving to Tier II
63. The criteria for moving from the Core Program to the second tier in a given area are: (i)
there is sufficient agreement within the Government and among affected stakeholders on a wellarticulated policy reform agenda; and (ii) the reform has a positive impact on one or more of the
following areas: economic growth, fiscal space, and social inclusion. The second tier could bring to
bear policy-based lending by the Bank, provided that there exists a sound macroeconomic
framework and a robust reform program that has a positive impact on the fiscal situation.
64. During the life of the CPS, the WBG and the GoL will evaluate progress made by the GoL
in the implementation of its reform agenda and determine the area(s) in which results have been
achieved and where there is enough traction to deepen engagement. It is understood that the
assistance strategy could move into the second tier in one or more sectors while remaining in the
Core Program in other areas. The areas of engagement in the Core Program are presented below
along with current and planned WBG instruments of support and anticipated program outcomes, as
agreed with the GoL, and shown in the Results Matrix in Annex 1.

19

F.

Areas of Engagement

65. Building on the Bank’s experience and dialogue with the Government during the last three
years, the following areas have been selected because of their critical role in supporting Lebanon’s
economic growth, fiscal and social stability, as well reinforcing economic and trade relations with
the Gulf and the Mashreq.

Fiscal Stability and Public Financial Management
66. Lebanon’s fiscal and public debt positions create major risks to macro-fiscal sustainability
and to prospects for high growth. Debt and, hence, the debt service burden are high, depleting the
fiscal space that is needed for public investments in lagging economic infrastructure and social
services. To achieve enough fiscal adjustment to generate a sizable primary surplus with a
beneficial impact on efficiency and growth will require a combination of the following:


Improving the management of the electric power sector to reduce costs, improve
revenue collection, promote energy efficiency, and thus reduce subsidies (about US$1.2
billion), while increasing supply and strengthening the performance of existing systems
through adequate investment;



Reforming the public sector pension system to restore its financial viability and raise
the productivity of the public labor force without increasing real government spending
(such reforms would also improve equity over the medium run);



Increasing the equity and efficiency of the tax system, for example by improving
taxation of real-estate property and capital gains on real estate transactions and
considering measures that make for better burden sharing across socioeconomic groups;
and



Dynamic debt management, through additional measures such as selective asset swaps
when possible, and foreign assistance—linked to a program of structural and fiscal
reforms—to smooth the burden of fiscal adjustment.

67. In addition, clear linkages need to be made between public resource management and the
Government’s macroeconomic objectives, and better alignment is needed between expenditure and
planning. The annual budgeting process is marred by variability and uncertainty, and both
transparency and monitoring functions are in need of strengthening.
68. The steps that have been taken by the GoL over the past two years could be expanded into a
sustained program of fiscal consolidation and debt management. Bearing in mind the country’s
complex political economy, some of the above reform options could be designed and implemented
rapidly under the Core Program, whereas other reforms will require Lebanon to make fundamental
choices regarding the future role and responsibilities of the State, and thus, may require a longer
timeframe for maturation, decision, and implementation. Any of the reforms outlined above in the
areas of expenditure management and/or revenue enhancement will improve efficiency in the use
of public resources and create fiscal space. As such, they are expected to increase productive public
investment and the availability of public services, leading to growth and better social outcomes.

20

69. In the area of public financial management, the GoL has made significant progress in
implementing reforms. Nevertheless, there remain three areas where progress has been slow and
where better efficiency and accountability are needed to ensure effective fiduciary risk mitigation,
not only for Bank-financed investments, but also for the GoL’s own resources. Addressing these
issues would pave the way for using country systems to support Bank-financed operations. Priority
areas include: (i) consolidating the budget by establishing a unified budget framework that
accounts for public sector financial activities, including foreign-financed projects and Council for
Development and Reconstruction (CDR) projects and presents consolidated audited financial
statements; (ii) strengthening internal controls by amending the Public Accounting Law and
establishing an internal audit function at the Ministry of Finance; (iii) strengthening external audit
by reforming the Court of Accounts (COA) to address the issues of independence and the
amendment of the mandate to cover exclusively the external audit function; and (iv) revising the
current public procurement laws and setting in motion a number of activities that will facilitate
effective implementation of the law (e.g. updating standard bidding documents, training staff, and
establishing a dispute resolution mechanism).
70. Capacity building and implementation support for public finance management and fiscal
consolidation is a key element of the Core Program. The main goals of this engagement are to
improve budget preparation and the comprehensiveness of the budget, with an emphasis on
integrating the current and capital budget; placing the annual budget in a multi-year perspective;
strengthening budget execution with a focus on the treasury management function; and
strengthening debt management; along with the creation of a specialized Debt Management
Department in the Ministry of Finance. The Bank is providing technical assistance—funded
through a grant under the Lebanon Trust Fund—to facilitate this work (Fiscal Management Reform
Implementation Support Project). The implementation of this project, which is being closely
coordinated with related support from the IMF Middle East Technical Assistance Center (METAC)
and forthcoming European Commission (EC) assistance, is expected to gain pace and bring results
over the next two years. In the 2010 budget circular, the Government has laid the ground and
provided a three years medium-term framework for the preparation of the 2010 to 2012 budgets.
71. Statistical capacity building to enhance the quality of policy and decision making is
another key element of the Core Program. A Statistical Master Plan has been recently prepared by
GoL with technical support from the World Bank. The Plan provides for setting up the regulatory
and institutional framework as well as building the national capacity for production, analysis, and
dissemination of economic and social data. Its implementation is critical to creating a system that
can produce the timely and relevant data needed by both policy makers and civil society. The Bank
will continue to support these efforts in coordination with other development partners using trust
fund resources.
72. The GoL recognizes that the importance of gender statistics is an important factor in
highlighting and mainstreaming gender issues in its economic planning, policy-making and
development. Therefore, the GoL’s Statistical Capacity Building Program includes a gender
statistics component with gender-specific activities. These include: (i) a comprehensive review of
recent and accessible research that sheds light on gender equality and gender equity issues in
Lebanon; (ii) mainstreaming gender coverage in the questionnaires and surveys to be carried out by
the Central Administrations for Statistics (CAS); and (iii) ensuring that the CAS mandate includes
the provision of gender relevant statistics and harmonization and coordination of gender statistical
work in Lebanon. The World Bank, in coordination with other development partners (UNDP, EC,
USAID, and Agence Franҫaise de Developpement (AFD) will provide coordinated financial
support and technical assistance to the CAS in implementing these activities.

21

Competitive Business Environment
73. The ability of Lebanon’s private sector to generate growth and employment is severely
constrained by the high costs of doing business and by the inequitable and unpredictable
application of policy. Key binding constraints to private-sector led economic growth arise from: (i)
uncompetitive infrastructure pricing and unreliability, such as in telecommunications and
electricity; (ii) high cost of doing business due to outdated commercial laws, vague and nontransparent regulations, discretionary bureaucratic interpretation, and weak contract enforcement;
(iii) insufficient domestic and regional trade facilitation; (iv) rigid labor and social security
regulations restricting flexibility in the domestic and regional labor market; and (v) the absence of
a regulatory framework for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). While Lebanon has a sophisticated
financial system, further improvements in the financial sector could increase Lebanon’s
competitive edge. For instance, access to credit remains limited and costly, and the right to use
moveable property for collateral is not well established. Corruption is another hindrance to
developing a more vibrant private sector in Lebanon. In addition, reliable and transparent corporate
financial reporting is needed to build investor confidence and support a strong business climate,
with consequent positive impacts on competitiveness and economic growth. Small- and MediumEnterprise (SME) are playing an increasing role in catalyzing economic growth, as important
sources of job creation, and the ability of an SME to produce high-quality, transparent and
comparable financial statements is often a determining factor for access to credit. All of the abovementioned issues create a perception of high-risk for new business entrants, discourage new
investments, and hamper competitiveness. These difficulties and many others are reflected in
Lebanon’s rank of 108th out of 183 economies in the “Ease of Doing Business Index” for 2010.
74. In the capital market, Lebanon has thus far fallen short of improving regulations and
pursuing structural policies that optimize the impact of foreign inflows on the productive
capacity of the domestic economy. Capital inflows are invested in a narrow scope of sectors,
including the banking and real estate sectors. In addition, as is the case in most small open
economies, the large capital inflows are causing a contraction of sectors producing traded goods
and causing a corresponding increase in relative prices. In advancing its financial market, Lebanon
can build the capacity of the Beirut Stock Exchange and promote investment banking; this can
increase opportunities for investors and provide new sources of funding for entrepreneurs and the
business community at large.
75. Furthermore, findings from a 2008 World Bank Report on gender highlights that gender
inequities exist in the private sector in Lebanon.15 While on average, female workers are more
educated than male workers, females experience wage discrimination, and SMEs owned by women
find it harder to access finance and face greater challenges circumventing the many regulatory
processes than do their male counterparts. As a result, female entrepreneurship is relatively low in
Lebanon. As part of its program for improving the business environment, which calls for
increasing the number of financial tools available to SMEs and bringing business support services
up to international best practices, the GoL intends to pursue targeted initiatives to level the playing
field for women-owned/operated SMEs. These gender-targeted initiatives will be supported by
World Bank Group activities which will explore: (i) a financial guarantee/risk sharing product to
support women-owned SMEs; (ii) a gender-integrated approach within an assessment of SME
access to finance in the governorates surrounding the Beirut area; (iii) a gender-disaggregated list
of baseline indicators for the monitoring of performance and graduation of women-versus male15

22

owned SMEs from Business Development Centers (BDCs); and (iv) the development of genderrelevant training and business support initiatives within the broader SME business support
program. IFC Advisory Services aims to provide support to financial institutions to help them
target women-owned businesses specifically.
76. To help the GoL tackle the challenges in the business environment, the World Bank Group
will support the GoL to: (i) improve government regulations and policy to facilitate private sector
dynamism, in particular for SMEs; (ii) develop and implement a new competition law and build the
capacity of a dedicated authority to phase out exclusive agency agreements and enforce regulations
that foster competition and create a level playing field for private sector; (ii) remove the
impediments to independent power producers and public-private partnerships by modifying certain
provisions of the Code of Commerce; (iii) facilitate lending through collateral that would
strengthen SMEs’ access to finance; and (iv) promote the modernization of the accounting and
reporting architecture through capacity building workshops and training of SMEs on international
reporting standards. This agenda has been prepared with the support of the Bank Group’s policy
dialogue and analytic work and is also linked to enabling private investment and to other priority
sectors such as power and telecommunications, water, and public financial management. On
financial development, the WBG will help the GoL articulate clear policy objectives and strategy
during the CPS period with Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA), such as selected Reports on
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs), including a bank governance assessment, and an
FSAP Update, when the government is ready for such diagnostic work. The Bank will also partner
with the Lebanese Accounting Association to strengthen the professional accountancy body and to
support accountancy reforms.
77. Given the potential of the telecommunications sector in stimulating private sector
investment and contributing to growth, the CPS will support the GoL’s objective to structure the
telecommunications sector in a way that introduces competition, improves capacity and quality
of services, reduces cost to consumers while maintaining the flow of critically needed revenue
into the national budget. The GoL is developing a new reform strategy for the sector consisting
of: (i) defining and establishing a strategic and policy framework for the restructuring and
development of the sector that maximizes its contribution to economic growth and generates
sufficient fiscal revenues for the treasury; (ii) aligning the existing institutions and operators to the
framework by restructuring them to operate on a commercial basis; and (iii) gradually bringing in
market forces through private participation in investments and in provision of all telecom services
to drive down the cost of services in line with global trends. This new strategy, once finalized, will
require an agreement within government on the path and the pace of implementation. Under the
Core Program of the CPS, the World Bank Group will continue providing advice to finalize the
development of the telecommunication sector strategy. An Institutional Development Fund Grant
will be mobilized to finance capacity building to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. In
addition, IFC Advisory and Investment products could be leveraged to the extent the private sector
becomes part of the GoL’s strategy for telecom reform.
Economic Infrastructure
78. Access to reliable and cost-effective infrastructure services remains a major constraint on
growth and social development in Lebanon. The unreliability of infrastructure services, combined
with differences in availability across the country, hinders competitiveness of Lebanese industry,
constrains economic growth and increases regional disparities.

23

79. Lebanon also stands to gain from the regional integration of its infrastructure networks,
namely the transportation network and, the electricity network. The integration of the
transportation network would promote an efficient transfer of merchandise and persons and would
be a critical element in facilitating regional trade, especially with the growing markets of Syria and
Iraq. In the electricity and gas sectors, by connecting to the regional network, Lebanon would be
able to overcome shortage problems caused by an inefficient and ineffective electricity sector once
increased supply becomes available.
 Electricity Sector
80. Economic growth and fiscal stability in Lebanon are unattainable without major reform
and investment in the electric power sector. Currently the sector cannot supply the electricity
needed by households and businesses. Massive subsidies are required (amounting to 4 percent of
GDP in 2009) to cover insufficient revenues, because overall the performance of the sector is very
poor: tariffs are set far too low for cost recovery, governance of the sector is inadequate, and
Electricité du Liban (EdL) performs poorly, both operationally and financially, with high technical
and financial losses. Investments in new generation capacity have lagged far behind growing
electricity demand. Reducing the fiscal burden of the sector on public finances, mobilizing
resources to meet energy investment needs, and restructuring EdL into a commercially viable
utility will be among the most important policy and structural reform challenges the Government
will have to undertake. Also, of importance in the GoL’s strategy in addressing the above
challenges is the role of energy conservation and of securing supplies of alternatives to expensive
fuel oil. Specific recommendations for reforming the power sector have been extensively discussed
at various levels of government, but in the past, lack of political decision and consensus over
sequencing of priorities has meant that little implementation has taken place.
81. The Bank Group aims to support the GoL’s action plan for development of the electricity
sector. The GoL, building on previous studies, has adopted in June 2010, an electricity sector
policy note, including a reform action plan aimed at improving the performance of the sector and
laying the foundation for a financially self-sustained sector in the medium- to long-term: This plan
includes a set of well articulated short, medium and long-term measures aimed at: (i) improving
sector governance by effectively corporatizing EdL’s management of the sector according to
commercial principles and building its managerial capacity to improve the technical and financial
performance of the sector; (ii) reducing the fiscal burden by revising the electricity tariff structure
and setting rates that will over time put the sector on a sustainable path; (iii) increasing the supply
of electricity-- additional 600 MW in the short-term and 900 MW in the medium-term; (iv)
reducing the cost of generation through investments in low fuel cost generation, rehabilitation of
transmission and distribution networks and contracting distribution, billing and collection to private
sector; (v) promoting renewables and increasing demand efficiency and energy savings; and (vi)
promoting all forms of Public-Private Partnerships to facilitate the modernization of the sector.
82. Under the Core Program, the Bank Group will support the GoL’s efforts to increase
efficiency and better manage the sector while helping to leverage other donors’ investments in
generation and transmission capacity. Through ongoing technical assistance and policy dialogue,
the Bank will help advance reforms in the management of the sector while preparing an investment
loan to rehabilitate the transmission and distribution systems to ensure that investment in additional
generation capacity is well used. The Bank will also help the GoL mobilize concessional financing
from donors that have already committed and/or expressed interest in the sector. The Bank is
working with the GoL to help it finalize its strategic development plan for the electricity sector
along with a time-bound implementation plan in order to expedite endorsement by the GoL cabinet.

24

Finally, the Bank plans to provide technical assistance and financing support for implementation of
sustainable energy efficiency and demand-side management programs as well as alternative energy
such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and renewables. In parallel, IFC will explore investment and
advisory opportunities to facilitate greater lending by financial institutions (especially banks) to
enable them to finance the investments of their clients in sustainable energy, including energy
efficient systems and renewable energy. IFC Advisory Services and investment would
complement the Bank’s activities, in line with the GoL’s emerging strategy related to the role of
the private sector, especially in the area of PPPs.
83. Support to regional energy integration will be provided to help Lebanon strengthen the
interconnection of its power grid with the Mashreq countries, benefit from a regional gas supply
(either through pipeline or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) when deemed feasible, and participate in
the development of a regional energy market in the medium- to long-term. The WBG will use the
framework of the AWI to mobilize additional resources for investment and to roll-out
complementary instruments such as MIGA guarantees and IFC Advisory Services and investments,
including the use of PPP schemes.
 Water Sector
84. Despite Lebanon’s relatively ample water resources, its water supply and sanitation sector
has not kept pace with demand and lags far behind the standards associated with the country’s
level of economic development. The annual cost of inadequate public water supply is estimated at
US$470 million (2 percent of GDP in 2008), of which household spending on private water supply
is estimated at US$308 million. Despite relatively high connection rates, the continuity of water
supply is low and reaches as little as three hours a day in the Beirut-Mount Lebanon region which
houses about 40 percent of the Lebanese population. It is estimated that the seasonal imbalance of
water resources will lead to chronic water shortages by as early as 2020 if no measures are taken to
improve efficiency and to increase storage capacity. Wastewater collection coverage averages 58
percent and wastewater treatment facilities are few and small. Discharge of wastewater has
polluted water resources and the use of raw wastewater is increasingly leading to soil pollution and
health hazards. Environmental degradation caused by the discharge of untreated wastewater costs
Lebanon about one percent of GDP a year.
85. Several government actions are needed to address the irregularity of water supply and the
environmental threat posed by untreated waste. First, investments are needed to reconstruct,
rehabilitate, and expand water supply and wastewater networks, treatment plants, storage, and
transfer facilities. To this end, an integrated water sector policy and strategy will help identify and
prioritize programs and activities in the sector. Second, Lebanon’s Regional Water Authorities
(RWAs) need technical, financial, and managerial autonomy so they can improve operations and
maintenance, raise cost-recovery levels, and build internal capacity. Third, efforts need to be made
to enable the expansion of private sector participation in the sector.
86. Wastewater collection and treatment services need to be extended, and discharges need to
be subject to tighter control. Wastewater services, which fall legally under the jurisdiction of the
RWSs, are de facto provided and financed by the Ministry of Water and Energy, Municipalities,
NGOs, donors, and small private sector operators. Regional Water Authorities have yet to take full
responsibility for wastewater collection and treatment, and the unfinished reform agenda has
contributed to institutional uncertainty and fragmentation of functions. The discharge of
wastewater and the use of raw wastewater need to be more strongly monitored and controlled by
the government.

25

87. The Bank will support the Government in water supply along a number of lines. In the
Core Program, through financing of the Greater Beirut Water Supply Project, the Bank plans to
target the provision of additional potable water to Greater Beirut. This Project aims to provide
clean water to around 1.5 million people in the Greater Beirut Region. Under this operation, the
GoL expects to complete the restructuring of the sector, build the management capacity of the
Ministry, and help the RWAs develop and implement a new tariff structure and farm out billing
and collection. The Bank will also support the preparation of an Integrated Water Sector Policy and
Strategy to prioritize and sequence the needed investments in the sector for consideration and
decisions by the GoL.
 Transport
88. Transport has become a major constraint on economic and social activities in Greater
Beirut. Institutional capacity to oversee urban transport services is nominal, and regulations to
ensure minimum levels of quality and safety are rarely enforced. With almost no formal public
urban transport system, the more than 2 million Beirut residents rely on cars to meet their transport
needs. Estimates indicate that public transport carries about 30 percent of daily passenger
movements/trips throughout Lebanon. Services are provided by the informal sector, mainly by
shared taxis, which are privately owned and operated, primarily by single-vehicle owners providing
both intra- and inter-city transport. Private sector operators provide dependable bus and taxi
services. Major investments since 2006 have improved the urban transport infrastructure. The key
challenges the GoL will face in improving urban mobility will be enforcing traffic rules and
regulations, promoting private sector investments in urban transport services, planning for and
adequately managing road assets, and mobilizing enough funding to carry out regular road
maintenance and properly address road safety issues.
89. Under the Core Program, the Bank will continue through the existing Urban Transport
Development Project (UTDP) to provide the GoL financial and AAA support to establish a basic
institutional framework and to complete the critical investments needed to maximize efficiency of
existing urban transport infrastructure in the City of Beirut and the Greater Beirut area. Moreover,
the Bank will support the government with technical assistance to address the remaining challenges
under the UTDP Project, namely: securing the effective performance of the installed traffic
management system, implementation of the Traffic Police Action Plan and, completion of the
preparatory studies for an integrated public transport system. The Core Program will also lay the
foundation for potential World Bank financial support for an integrated Public Transport System in
Beirut (Trans-Beirut). This will include completion of the restructuring of the existing Public
Transport Authority, addressing the legacy of existing service taxi enfranchisement, and
identification of a mechanism for the financial sustainability of a public transport system. IFC will
also explore opportunities to support private sector investment in this sector.
90. With regard to trade, excess costs, time-intensive port clearances and land border crossings
reduce Lebanon’s competitiveness. The average cost to bring a container from Beirut port to the
city is more than US$600 and there is an average of a week before imported goods are available for
use. Asycuda World (AW), a web-based system for submitting and assessing customs declarations
is being introduced to address part of this issue. Major benefits will only be gained through the
coordinated implementation of AW by the Mashreq Countries and by better coordination of
Lebanon’s own import inspections procedures. Lebanon’s principal foreign trade is in services and,
until recently, there has been little interest in facilitating export trade in goods. This approach has

26

shifted in light of the new initiative to position Tripoli as a regional trade hub. More than 70
percent of Lebanon’s international trade passes through the port of Beirut and is linked to three
trade corridors: two East-West to Iraq and one North-South from the EU to the Gulf. Lebanon’s
connection to these corridors is part of the GoL’s regional integration and economic growth
strategy. In this regard, the Core Program could include a regional project to facilitate cross border
trade for Mashreq countries; this effort would lead to improved transport infrastructure more
efficient and fluid logistics chains within the sub-region, including border crossings and missing
infrastructure links in the case of Lebanon. IFC will explore opportunities to expand its successful
Global Trade Finance Program which provides guarantees to selected Lebanese banks involved in
trade and related activities for SMEs.
 Environment and Waste Management
91. Lebanon needs to reverse the degradation trend of its natural resources to preserve and
capitalize on the benefits of the country’s environmental domain. There is strong competition for
land in Lebanon, and the absence of a more efficient land use planning system has resulted in
increased pollution and environmental degradation, which threatens the resource-based sources of
economic growth, such as agriculture and tourism. Lebanon made significant strides in its efforts to
address environmental degradation, but is still facing major issues including: (a) air pollution in
Lebanon’s urban centers; (b) water quality degradation and a gradual move towards a water
balance deficit by 2020; (c) insufficient wastewater network; (d) poor municipal solid waste
management; (e) limited land and biodiversity resources; and (f) high urban pressure on the coast
line. For example, municipal solid waste is a persistent issue, given that Lebanon generates a total
of 1.4 million tons/year of which 800,000 tons/year are collected from Greater Beirut and Mount
Lebanon and transferred to the Naameh Sanitary Landfill, which was established in 1998 to take 3
million tons for the following ten years. At present, the quantity of waste has reached more than 8
million tons. In the cities, there is only one controlled waste dump in Tripoli and one sanitary
landfill to serve the Municipalities of Zahle, which was financed by the World Bank. All the other
cities dispose their waste in open dumps, river basins and valleys.
92. Under the Core Program, technical assistance will be provided to support the preparation
of the Government’s action plan for the establishment of an integrated and affordable municipal
solid waste management system throughout the country. More specifically, the Bank through
AAA will support: (i) enhancing institutional and legal framework for the solid waste sector; (ii)
improving financial performance of the sector (on both cost and revenue sides), including cost
effectiveness of private and public services and cost recovery system; and (iii) enhancing social
and environmental performance of the sector. The Bank will also support Lebanon in accessing the
carbon market and in promoting Clean Development Mechanism operation in solid waste sector,
and hence generating additional revenues for the sector while contributing to climate change
mitigation. Using trust funds and building on the 2010-CEA, the Bank will support the GoL in
improving environmental governance, more specifically with regard to the predictability of the
regulatory and institutional framework, the improvement of the enforcement of
environmental regulations, the harmonization of the environmental assessment system, and the
disclosure of environmental information which are all important constraints to private sector
investment. In parallel, IFC will explore advisory opportunities to promote cleaner production
processes and technologies.

27

 Local Economic Development
93. The GoL’s objectives aim at clarifying the responsibility of local governments, enhancing
the status of the elected authorities, streamlining the functioning of the municipal council, and
modernizing the administrative and financial procedures. To this effect, the GoL is preparing a new
Decentralization Law. In addition, several major reforms are also under consideration to improve
and consolidate the municipalities’ finances: (i) local tax system reform to give more weight to the
property tax which takes into account the real contributive capability of a particular area; (ii)
pioneering modern municipal management systems to gradually strengthen the decentralization
process (i.e., budget process, accounting system, computerization, etc.); and (iii) the revision of the
Independent Municipal Fund management practices to improve the predictability of the transfers
and facilitate the financing of local investments. In terms of financing options for municipalities,
IFC could leverage its global experience with sub-national finance to support improved and
extended public services at the local level on the basis of non sovereign, commercial financing with
a view to expanding financing options for municipalities and eligible state-owned enterprises.
94. The GoL considers tourism development not only as a key economic priority (earning 20
percent of the country's GDP prior to the civil war as indicated by the Ministry of Tourism), but
also as an essential vehicle to promote local development, in close collaboration with the local
government and the private sector. By leveraging its full potential, tourism can serve as a catalyst
for reviving regional economies, creating local job opportunities, favoring backward-forward
linkages to local communities, generating income alternatives, and raising municipal revenues.
This is especially useful to dispel the evident regional disparities between the northern and
southern parts of the country and the area around the coasts and Beirut.
95. Under the Core Program, the Bank will provide TA to help the GoL develop the municipal
sector and promote local development. This TA will cover the following areas: (i) institutional
level: the effective application of new management guidelines, after the adoption of the new
Decentralization Law; (ii) spatial management: better coherence of city projects with the national
land use planning strategy, and the development of a long-term integrated regional development
program; (iii) management capacity: awareness building among the elected representatives with
regard to land-related issues, the modernization of the territorial civil service, the dynamic
management and training of human resources, the introduction of modern management tools, and
the more systematic involvement of civil society in development plans; (iv) financial-level: the
increased mobilization of local resources, the identification of new revenue streams, and the use of
loans as part of the overall financing of urban needs; and (v) community-driven development:
investments that will create jobs, income opportunities, leverage local assets thereby increasing
economic empowerment in communities and reducing regional disparities.
96. Building on the achievements of the Cultural Heritage and Urban Development Project
(CHUD), as well as the First Municipal Infrastructure Project (FMIP), under the Core Program
the Bank plans to provide a Sector Investment Loan (SIL) for local community development,
which would bring together the main policies and reforms to address the key institutional and
financial challenges described above and help reduce regional disparities. It would also be an
important instrument to better equip cities to participate actively in delivering on the country’s
broad-based economic growth strategy, while also mobilizing the additional financing to increase
the much needed urban infrastructure and improve cities’ competitiveness. Promoting the country’s
unique cultural and historical assets through a well-managed local development program is also
key.

28

Human Capital Development and Social Protection
 Education
97. The quality of education outcomes in Lebanon is inconsistent with the level of investment,
as the internal efficiency of public education is low. Lebanon has a pupil/teacher ratio of 17:1 at
the primary level and 8:1 at the secondary level; dropout and repetition rates have been persistently
high; and the number of investment years required to produce a 9th grade completer is very high.
Also, the distribution of physical facilities has been highly politicized, resulting in over-capacity in
some areas and under-capacity in others. The oversupply and misallocation of teaching and
administrative staff is acute, causing salaries and wages to constitute 87 percent of the Ministry of
Education and Higher Education’s total spending.
98. However, despite the oversupply of teachers, the teaching force is under qualified with only 4
percent of public school teachers holding a specialized degree and more than half possessing less
than a university level education. There is little or no in-service training offered to new teachers,
and the quality standards for hiring new teachers is weak.
99. While gross enrollment rates at the primary level are above the regional average (at
72percent), the share of these students enrolled in public Kindergartens represents only 20percent
of total enrollment. The public Kindergartens are not distributed according to local needs, nor do
the teachers have the necessary qualifications. In addition, infrastructure and equipment is substandard in many of the Kindergartens located in disadvantaged areas.
100. Finally, financing of the education sector is highly fragmented and inefficient, and leads to
inequities. Government budget statistics do not allow resource allocation to be analyzed by level of
education, region, learning outcomes, or socioeconomic groups of beneficiaries. In higher
education, quality standards, quality assessment mechanisms, and accreditation processes are
virtually absent. In coming years, the GoL needs to embark on a second phase of education sector
reforms to address these key challenges.
101. As part of the Core Program, the Bank plans to provide support to the GoL’s education
quality enhancement program in the form of a Sector Investment Loan which would: (i) increase
the enrollment rate of children 3 to 5 years of age in public schools, improving their school
readiness and equal opportunity at the start of general education; (ii) enhance the quality of
teaching and learning; and (iii) lay the groundwork for improving the interface between the general
education, technical/vocational education, and higher education streams, and for better aligning the
education system with the requirements of the labor market. IFC will explore possibilities of
developing student lending programs delivered through the banking sector, targeting low- and
middle-income students, drawing on the experiences of its student loan programs in other countries
in the MENA region.
102. The GoL also intends to lay the groundwork for medium-term reforms in higher education.
Based on the prevailing political economy, the GoL is also giving priority to addressing the
challenges facing higher education particularly the lack of quality assurance and accreditation
mechanisms. The Bank will support the GoL in this choice and in building a partnership through
either technical assistance or a subsequent investment loan targeted to reforms in the higher
education sector.

29

 Pensions, Health Insurance, Social Safety Nets and Labor Markets
103. Lebanon’s social protection system consists of a fragmented and low-coverage social
security (pension) system, multiple health insurance schemes, limited and badly-targeted social
safety net programs, and distorted labor markets. The pension system has low coverage and high
fiscal costs and entails very different treatment for workers in the public sector, the military, and
the private sector. The pension schemes for the civil service and military, run by the Ministry of
Finance, cover just 6 percent of the labor force and cost 2.7 percent of GDP a year (of which 2.2
percent account for military pensions); the current implicit pension debt represents between 50-60
percent of GDP. By contrast, the End-of-Service-Indemnity (EOSI) scheme for private sector
workers, run by the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), covers 30 percent of the labor force and
has annual expenditures of 0.8 percent of GDP. The EOSI runs a surplus and has reserves of about
12.6 percent of GDP. Even so, as an end-of-service-indemnity scheme, it does not provide its
beneficiaries adequate protection in old age. While in the private sector the implicit rates of return
on contributions and targeted replacement rates are low and inadequate, in the public sector they
are significant and unaffordable, resulting in inequitable treatment of workers across plans and
insufficient income protection during old age.
104. With regard to the gender dimension, the government recognizes that the high incidence of
migration among men has consequently created a higher incidence of female-headed
households thereby increasing the proportion of women among the most vulnerable in the
population. In view of this, the government intends to ensure that its national targeting system
incorporates a gender dimension in better targeting government subsidies to vulnerable women.
The Bank will continue to provide technical assistance under the Emergency Social Protection
Implementation Support Project II (ESPISP II) and a new TA for the roll-out of the new targeting
system.
105. Much technical and financial assistance has been deployed over the past three years to
address the key challenges facing NSSF: its inadequate governance, weak administrative systems,
and design problems with the three programs that it manages—end-of-service indemnity, health
insurance (maternity and sickness fund), and family allowances.
106. Lebanon needs a comprehensive framework for health insurance and social protection.
Despite a large number of public insurers and private insurance companies, less than 50 percent of
the population enjoys formal health insurance coverage. Out-of-pocket household spending, as a
result, accounts for more than 60 percent of total health expenditures. Such health financing
arrangements give households inadequate financial protection from the costs of ill-health. Seven
public institutions offer health insurance programs, implicitly or explicitly.16 There is little
coordination between their policies, and in the case of the Ministry of Health and the NSSF the
mandates regarding population coverage and the use of public subsidies have not been clearly
defined.
107. The problem of employment creation in Lebanon is acute and is related to the nature and
level of growth, the investment climate, labor market policies, skills creation, and social
protection policies. During the last decade there has been virtually no net employment creation,
with those jobs that have been created being mostly in the informal sector and lacking social
security coverage. The unemployment rate has increased (7.8 percent in 2004 to 8.9 percent in
16

The National Social Security Fund (NSSF), the Ministry of Public Health, the Fund for Civil Servants, the Fund for the
Military, the Fund for Teachers, and two funds for Security Forces.

30

2007) and is more prevalent among females. Youth unemployment is at a regional high (26
percent). Labor mobility between civil service and private sectors, and also within the private
sector is discouraged by inadequate portability of social security benefits. Active labor market
policies and programs are inadequate to address issues of unemployability, job search or
entrepreneurship. Over the next 10 years, the Lebanese economy would need to create more than 5
times the number of jobs it is currently creating in order to absorb the new labor market entrants.
108. In doing so, special attention will be given to the gender dimension in light of the fact that
women’s employment stands at 37 percent. To provide women with greater access to quality
employment, Lebanon could benefit from a review of the labor code in terms of addressing areas
that may constitute discouraging factors to women’s employment. In the context of the World Bank
MILES (Macroeconomics, Investment Climate, Labor Market Institutions, Education and Social
Protection) framework, an employee-employer survey will be supplemented with a module on
gender to collect and analyze data on challenges of informality and job security for women in
Lebanon, for which a gender report will be produced as an input to the government framework.
Moreover, the Bank will provide technical assistance support and capacity-building to review and
amend the labor code with special attention to gender inclusion.17 IFC will explore opportunities to
promote greater access to finance opportunities for women-owned businesses through the financial
sector, in close cooperation with the Bank.
109. Formal social safety net programs are weak, fragmented, and inadequate to play an
effective role in time of economic need. The few programs that exist (housing, education, and
heating-fuel subsidies) are not well targeted, so their poverty impact is questionable. The Ministry
of Social Affairs (MOSA) is the main public provider of social safety net programs with an annual
budget of only US$60 million, of which 70 percent is distributed to NGOs and welfare
associations. Though many community and local development programs exist, and are primarily
supported by donors, there is little harmonization or coordination among them. With one million
Lebanese living on no more than US$4/day, and 300,000 living on US$2.4/day or less18, and with
the evidence of widening regional disparities, the GoL needs to consider a larger and more
effective role for social safety nets.
110. In social insurance and labor markets, the Ministry of Labor (MOL) has defined a
program of reform, the key elements of which include: (i) introducing and implementing the new
pension system for private workers; (ii) developing effective active labor market policies and
program (ALMPs) which include redefining the role and structure of the National Employment
Office; (iii) modernizing labor market policies including related regulations; (iv) furthering reforms
in the National Social Security Fund (NSSF); (v) developing income protection mechanisms for
workers; and (vi) strengthening the MOL’s capacity to lead the reform process and its
implementation. The GoL intends to proceed with the full roll out and implementation of the
National Poverty Targeting Program (NPTP) and will develop and adopt a health insurance
framework to provide organizing principles for any plans to expand and rationalize health
insurance coverage. Each area of the above program will pay particular attention to the gender
17
The Lebanese labor law has undergone a number of revisions since it was issued in 1946, a period during which Lebanon
also signed various international and regional labor agreements. In this context, and in order to better adapt to international
and regional changes in labor legislation, the Minister of Labor signed a proposed revision of the labor law in early 2010. The
proposal was forwarded to the Cabinet in May 2010, and is expected to be approved by the end of 2010. With respect to the
gender related aspects of the law, the revisions propose a longer maternity leave (10 weeks), establish a one hour daily break
for breast-feeding women, and apply exceptions on certain types of firm from regulations against women working night shifts
and mandating certain types of firms to establish individual or collective child-care facilities.

characteristics of the Lebanese domestic labor market, for the purpose of enhancing gender
inclusion and social protection.
111. Under the Tier I Program, the Bank will continue providing implementation support
through the existing portfolio, namely ESPISP II and the multi-sector analytical program of
MILES. In addition, if requested, the Bank could provide a technical assistance loan to further
support the implementation of the above government program.

G.

Potential Lending Envelope

112. During the CPS period (FY11-14), the indicative lending envelope will range between
US$375 and US$550 million assuming reasonable pacing and distribution over the four-year CPS
period. The actual lending envelope will depend on a number of factors, some that are countryspecific and others that are related to IBRD’s overall financial capacity. The size and timing of
actual commitments will depend in particular on the mix of Investment Loans and Development
Policy Loans. The higher end of the range assumes that the program is primarily concentrated on
investment lending and that it is somewhat evenly distributed throughout the CPS period. Under
the Core Program, in addition to the ongoing portfolio, only investment lending and AAA is
envisioned. The Tier II Program assumes implementation of reforms in one or more of the priority
sectors along with a sound macro-economic framework, which will set the stage for budget support
through a general or sector-specific development policy loan.
V.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

113. Among the main risks in Lebanon is stop and go reform implementation. The
Government’s reform program emphasizes growth and fiscal deficit reduction to reduce the public
debt. While initiating the necessary structural, sectoral and social reforms is in most cases at the
Government’s discretion, advancing their implementation requires legislative approval and greater
consensus building within the Lebanese public. The past policy track record does not provide much
comfort in this area: the prolonged period of weak and slow reform implementation and lack of
fiscal adjustment is largely responsible for the high fiscal and current account imbalances and
volatile growth performance, despite the fact that the issues and remedies were well identified.
There is therefore a significant risk that narrow sectarian interests will continue to overshadow
national-level interests and obstruct again the implementation of the newly adopted economic
reform program. This risk could be compounded should macro-economic stresses develop, as a
result of external shocks (resulting from volatility in oil prices, surge in commodity prices, as well
as insufficient growth in the main partner regions). Maintaining the Bank’s effort to build future
capacity for reforms through analytical and advisory activities could help enhance consensus
around the reform program, which combined with continued strong engagement by the Bank in the
development and implementation of a social protection strategy, could provide a mitigation
instrument.
114. There are important external financial risks inherent in Lebanon’s dependence on foreign
capital inflows. Financial management has been helped by large inflows of foreign capital from the
Lebanese diaspora and from Arab investors that have fed the capacity of the economy and the
banking sector to absorb large sovereign debt. For the scheme to continue, confidence of both
domestic and foreign depositors and investors is key. Past episodes have shown that confidence is

32

highly sensitive to political developments.19 In addition, a change in international financial
prospects resulting in increased international interest rates would reduce the spread between
interest rates in Lebanon and the rest of the world. This would reduce capital inflow to Lebanon,
the alternative being a rise in domestic interest rates with detrimental consequences on Banks’
profits and on the budget balance. By maintaining fiscal discipline, the Government would be able
to mitigate this risk by compensating for the decline in the spread through a reduction in sovereign
risk.
115. Systemic corruption and governance-related risks are high. Lebanon’s public sector has
become a major source of political rents, aided by the weak rule of law and lack of law
enforcement, especially when offenders are politically protected. The political will to address these
obstacles remains constrained by sectarian interests. The CPS addresses governance problems
through promoting stronger accountability. Since this generally requires parallel bottom-up and
top-down approaches and coordination among various stakeholders, discussion about “feasible”
and “good enough” governance reforms to meet key development objectives is to be continued.
During the implementation of the CPS, the Bank will seek to deepen dialogue around feasible
governance arrangements that are compatible with Lebanon’s political economy. The Country
Management Unit has commissioned a country governance and anti-corruption analysis to identify
governance-related risks, as well as entry points to mitigate these risks against the background of
Lebanon’s complex political environment. Increasingly, it has been recognized that reform
practices that might seem ideal technically may not be feasible in Lebanon’s historical and
institutional setting.
116. Building capacity in the public sector remains important to address governance challenges.
Civil service reform per se is unlikely to be feasible. However, combined with building awareness
to prepare the ground for reforms, a targeted engagement in building capacity within sectors and
involving civil society in monitoring performance has potential for success.
117. Addressing governance challenges will require broadly-based communication and
participation across sectarian lines. One key measure is to enhance transparency through broader
public dialogue including with the media and stakeholders. This approach is likely to help build
awareness about the negative socioeconomic impact of current conditions. Analysis of
stakeholders’ positions has shown that reform will be difficult unless it is balanced among all
communities. Awareness of these issues allows a search for creative solutions to problems that are
often not technical in nature. The Bank through active engagement with the media, academia, and
local opinion leaders, will continue to support an informed debate around development issues and
the trade-offs that are involved in policy choices.
118. The fragile political environment in Lebanon and the tense regional security environment
could also pose important risks. Internally, the inter- and intra-sectarian divisions could restart,
easily provoking an escalation of tensions. Social unrest, security shocks and political missteps
may draw the country into political crisis and policy paralysis, and could badly hit investors and
depositors’ confidence. Lebanon is also exposed to a number of regional political and security
risks, such as the Arab-Israeli conflict and wider regional tensions.
19

For example, in Spring 2002 when regional and local developments necessitated massive bilateral donor support at the Paris
II Conference; in 2005 in the aftermath of the assassination of former PM Hariri; and in 2006 during and after the July
hostilities and ahead of the Paris III Conference. In each of these episodes, quick and substantial balance-of-payments and/or
budget support from friendly governments, combined with the dexterity of the Lebanese monetary authorities and the high
cohesion of the banking community, eventually succeeded in reassuring investors.

ANNEX 2: WORLD BANK PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE

1. There are eight active projects for a total net commitment of US$269.8 million (including
IBRD and Lebanon Trust Fund resources) of which US$138.4 million has been disbursed todate (July 5, 2010). Project implementation is generally satisfactory, and all projects are
expected to achieve their development objectives. However, four projects are currently at risk
in the portfolio, mainly due to slow disbursement and effectiveness delays. The Bank is
planning to engage in yearly participatory Country Portfolio Performance Reviews with the
Government to review portfolio implementation and ensure effective and satisfactory
completion of projects. The disbursement ratio over the last three years has been above the
three-year average (FY08-FY10) for MENA and for the IBRD portfolio as a whole; however,
in FY10 it was 14.9 percent which was below the MNA and Bank average of 19.2 percent
and 26.4 percent respectively.
2. In September 2006, the World Bank's Board of Governors approved a grant of US$70
million for a Lebanon Trust Fund (TFL) to support the Government's reconstruction efforts
following the July/August 2006 hostilities. The resources came in the form of a grant from
the Bank’s surplus. The TFL financing is assisting in municipal and water infrastructure
rehabilitation, supporting reform implementation in the energy and social sectors, and
improving the allocation and use of public financial resources. US$15 million was allocated
to IFC to scale up its Risk Sharing Facility to Lebanese banks by providing a first loss grant
(US$14 million) and technical assistance (US$1 million) to expand the coverage of Kafalat
(the Lebanese SME guarantee agency) and to support other organizations that finance SMEs.
3. The Bank’s portfolio was restructured in FY05 to strengthen project implementation.
Portfolio performance improved considerably thereafter. However, the two month
implementation interruption caused by the 2006 hostilities resulted in a delay of five to six
months for all the projects in the portfolio. Once project implementation resumed, close
supervision by the project teams (Government and Bank) resulted in improved performance
and reduced delays. Following the hostilities, the Bank adopted country financing parameters
for Lebanon which provided a new framework for cost sharing arrangements and greatly
improved the speed of implementation at a time of crisis. To ease the financial burden on the
Government, all Loan Agreements were amended in August 2006 to allow for 100 percent
financing and to eliminate counterpart contributions for a period of one year, until August
2007. PIUs quickly focused on remobilizing contractors to re-start the interrupted works.
Unallocated project funds were redirected towards emerging priority needs to relieve
hardship in local communities. To date, the Bank may still finance up to 100 percent of the
project costs based on merit and justification, applying the parameters with due diligence on
a project by project basis. This has increased the flexibility of use for Bank loan proceeds,
reduced the transaction costs to the country and the Bank, and is expected to enable easier
harmonization of donor procedures around country systems.
4. The portfolio financial management (FM) performance is overall satisfactory. This was
confirmed during the 2009 portfolio review and it will be updated for the coming
participatory Country Portfolio Performance Review. The strengths of the portfolio FM
performance include: adequate staffing, reliable and timely reporting, smooth funds flow,
adequate controls, and clean audit reports. However, the portfolio has an unsatisfactory audit
timeliness rate due to: (i) delay in receiving projects’ audit reports, audited financial

42

statements, and management letters; and (ii) to lack of assets management systems. In terms
of the audit issue, it is being addressed by early selection of auditors with whom the Bank is
conducting frequent informative and planning meetings to ensure delivery of timely
acceptable reports. As to the assets system, the projects are being required to maintain an
updated list of assets that is validated through having beneficiaries confirm existence and
functionality status and through performing physical inspection. During the CPS period,
these areas will continue to be monitored closely to ensure proper compliance.
5. Every project is born with two exogenous “flags,” signaling risks associated with the
macro-economic environment and poor outcome track record of completed projects.20 While
the number of project-specific risk flags initially increased in the wake of the hostilities, the
average number of flags per project is now below that of June 2006.
6. Nonetheless, a number of systemic obstacles to implementation, applicable to all projects
in the portfolio, remain. The public procurement system still relies on a law from the 1960s
and is in urgent need of reform21. While efforts have been taken by the Council for
Development and Reconstruction (CDR)—the main implementation agency for Bank funded
operations—to streamline the process, the tendering process still takes up to four months.
Concerns regarding the sustainability of institutional development components also remain,
due to the difficulties in attracting quality civil servants and consultants to the public sector,
associated with the GoL’s freeze on new hiring. These issues and others will be addressed in
the context of the GoL’s reform program.
7. Experience has shown that capacity building components tend to be ignored until late in
project life. This results in the need to extend projects to complete these components
satisfactorily. This tendency will be addressed early on in future operations by the project
teams.
8. In addition to the investment portfolio, Lebanon has been able to access a variety of
existing Bank-administered trust funds, including Institutional Development Fund grants,
Development grant Facility grants, Cities Alliance grants, Persistent Organic Pollutants Trust
Fund grants and grants from the State and Peace-Building Fund.22 The current portfolio
includes seven of these grants, totaling US$3.4 million. The portfolio has supported the postwar reconstruction of critical infrastructure (especially in the areas of water supply and
sanitation, urban transportation, and urban development) and the strengthening of capacity in
public institutions in need of reform (in electricity, social protection, and fiscal management).
It is worth noting that trust funds have played a central role in the World Bank’s support to
Lebanon and have been instrumental in the preparation of structural reforms under the ISN
and Paris III. This support was also bundled with IFC investments to facilitate bank lending
to SMEs affected by the conflict through Advisory support and risk guarantees. Trust funds
have also been used to support the reconstruction of the Nahr El-Bared camp and its adjacent
communities. In addition to the US$2 million grant from the Development Grant Facility
which is financing small-scale infrastructure projects and services for the communities
surrounding Nahr El-Bared, the Bank has set up a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) which
20
The flags are Country Environment and Country Record. The first is based on a composite indicator of a country’s
weak macro management. The second is based on an independent evaluation of samples of completed project (selected
by the Independent Evaluations Group), where net commitments associated with unsatisfactory projects represent more
than 40 percent of commitments for completed projects over the previous five years.

A new public procurement draft law is awaiting the approval of the Council of Ministers.

ANNEX 4: PROGRESS UNDER THE ISN (FY2008-2009) AND LESSONS LEARNED
Date of CAS:

July 9, 2007

Progress Report:
Period covered by ISN:

None required
July 1, 2007 – October 30, 2008

Introduction

1.
This document evaluates the achievement of the objectives of the FY08-09 Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) dated July 9, 2007 (Report 39779-LB). The document assesses the effectiveness of the
ISN in aligning its objectives with Lebanon’s strategic goals, keeping in mind the country’s
circumstances; and highlights the lessons learned over the period to inform the new Country
Partnership Strategy.
Context of the ISN

2.
The ISN was prepared in the aftermath of the summer 2006 hostilities and the ensuing
political impasse which had rendered some of the CAS (approved in December 2005) assumptions
and projections untenable. The move to an ISN reflects the recognition that greater focus and
flexibility are required. The period covered by the ISN was only 15 months in appreciation of the
uncertain economic and political situation in Lebanon and taking into account the elections that were
scheduled for the Fall of 2007, after which the Bank had planned to initiate a new CAS by October
2008.
3.
The ISN was designed to support the Government’s medium-term structural reform program
– Paris III – discussed at the International Donor Conference in January 2007. Paris III focused on
structural reforms, including fiscal adjustment to reverse Lebanon’s unfavorable debt dynamics,
reforms to enhance growth by strengthening the business environment and competitiveness and
social sector reforms. The ISN set out a transitional framework of technical and financial assistance
to contribute to the Government’s efforts to establish reform momentum.
4.
Implementing this ambitious Paris III program required broad political support and consensus
on key reforms, such as energy sector reforms which were critical for improved fiscal/debt
sustainability and growth prospects, and social sector reform to benefit the poor and vulnerable and
contribute to fiscal improvement in the medium term. However, the broad political support expected
at the time of the ISN preparation was short-lived and a political crisis emerged which lasted about
18 months and lead to the formation of a care-taker government until the parliamentary elections of
June 2009.
Overview of ISN Relevance

5.
The ISN program priorities were fully aligned with Lebanon’s own priorities and
development objectives. The ISN focused on providing assistance to the GoL to advance the
implementation of key reforms spelled out in Paris III and pave the way for their broadening and
deepening as the political environment would stabilize. The ISN correctly recognized that Lebanon
was facing a period of high uncertainty. The ISN, therefore, proposed a short-term transitional
support to the GoL and the areas of focus, particularly under pillar 1, were selected because they
could have the highest impact on medium-term public expenditure and social reform and were
deemed to enjoy broad political support.
48

6.
The ISN was, in substance, highly relevant and rightly aligned with the GoL strategy and was
structured around three pillars that should have been mutually reinforcing, and focused on: (1)
governance, economic management and growth support; (2) human capital development and poverty
reduction; and (3) resource and environmental management. The ISN was not results-based and there
were no specific targets outside the project results framework. Thus, it is difficult to judge progress
in meeting ISN objectives in many areas.
7.
The suggested lending and non-lending assistance was relevant and consistent with the
strategy. The major focus of the lending program was two consecutive Development Policy
Operations to support the implementation of the Government’s reform program (Paris III) and
projects financed by the Lebanon Trust Fund. The planned AAA was expected to inform the budget
planning exercise and the refinement of medium-term sector reform actions and address public
management and poverty assessment.
8.
The ISN focused on a set of early actions and outcomes needed to kick start and achieve the
Paris III program objectives over time, and was prepared on the basis of the apparent consensus of all
parties on the critical reforms needed to improve the fiscal/debt sustainability and growth prospects
in the medium to long term. The strategy clearly recognized that the period covered was uncertain,
but nevertheless proved to be ambitious and complex. The political situation in Lebanon continued to
be tense as of 2007 and the apparent consensus on the reform agenda quickly dissolved. Some of the
major risks identified in the ISN materialized and the government program the ISN was designed to
support proved to be too ambitious.
Identified Risks

9.
The ISN identified four key risks, all of which were considered to be high. First, the political
and security risks. The ISN noted that in the short run the fragile political environment in Lebanon
and the tense regional security environment posed the most important risks. Second, the ISN
identified public debt and financial crisis risks. The main risk of macroeconomic and financial
instability lies in the size of the fiscal imbalance and the spiraling public debt dynamic. The ISN also
identifies external financial risks given Lebanon’s dependence on foreign capital inflows from the
Lebanese diaspora and Arab investors. Third is the risk of stalled reform program. The ISN cites the
risk of narrow sectarian interests overshadowing the national-level interests, which could be
compounded as macro-economic stresses develop, given Lebanon’s poor past policy reform track
record. Fourth was portfolio risks that are rooted in the macro-economy, institutional processes and
capacity constraints. To partially mitigate the risks, the ISN focused WBG’s financial assistance on
fiscally and socially rewarding elements of the reform program; emphasized timely implementation
of the macroeconomic stabilization measures and intensified efforts to build the capacity for reforms.
Overview of ISN Implementation

10.
The implementation of the ISN objectives was supported by an IBRD lending envelope of
US$170 million for two DPLs in support of Paris III. The first DPL was approved in August 2007.
However, the Government failed to demonstrate significant progress in implementing Paris III, and
the DPL’s performance triggers, particularly on a program for electricity sector restructuring. The
second DPL was, therefore, never completed. Instead of a second DPL, the Board approved
additional financing for the Urban Transport project for US$69.7 million. The ISN had envisaged
two additional projects financed by the Lebanon Trust Fund and both were approved in FY09 for a
total commitment of US$10 million focusing on providing additional technical assistance on social
protection reform and fiscal management.
49

11.
Out of the 12 projects active during the ISN period up to June 2009 (6 IBRD loans, 6 grants
from the Lebanon Trust Fund, of which one was WBG executed, and one DPL), 2 IBRD projects
(Community Development Project and First Municipal Infrastructure Project) closed as well as the
WBG-executed project from the TFL. The Community Development Project was rated “moderately
satisfactory” on overall outcome of the project and on WBG performance, due to the difficult
political environment and institutional framework that was present during project implementation.
The First Municipal Infrastructure Project closed achieving all of its development objectives and was
rated “satisfactory” on outcomes, WBG and Borrower performance.
12.
The general quality of the projects that remained open during the ISN period was good,
however some projects continued to suffer from procurement, disbursement and effectiveness delays.
One IDF grant closed (National HIV/AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation) and one PCF Grant
(Establishment of Mechanisms for National Reconstruction) closed during the period under
consideration, yielding satisfactory results. There were no apparent safeguard issues in the portfolio
under the ISN period. In order to ease the financial burden on the Government, all Loan Agreements
were amended in August 2006 to allow for 100 percent financing and eliminate counterpart
contributions for a period of one year, until August 2007. The new WBG policy (OP/BP6.0)
simplified procedures and reduced the transaction costs imposed on the Government of Lebanon. To
date, the WBG may still finance up to 100 percent of the project costs based on merit and
justification, applying the parameters with due diligence on a project by project basis. This has
increased the flexibility of use for WBG loan proceeds, reduced the transaction costs to the country
and the WBG, and is expected to enable easier harmonization of donor procedures around country
systems. The policy rests on three guiding principles: (i) expenditures financed from the WBG loan
proceeds are productive; (ii) the impact of operations financed under such loans on the borrowing
country’s fiscal sustainability is acceptable; and (iii) oversight arrangements on the use of WBG
funds are acceptable.
13.
The five proposed diagnostic activities were completed, but only one was delivered on time
and four were delivered with slight delay. The energy and water Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
was deemed more appropriate than the traditional Poverty Assessment planned in the ISN to analyze
the distributional impacts of the proposed structural reforms (that would affect access to, quality and
cost of service) and mitigation measures. This diagnostic work together with the three Public
Expenditure Reviews provided the GoL with meaningful information and analysis to implement
reforms. One of the five activities should have been labeled as technical assistance as it was designed
to provide technical assistance to the GoL in addressing some the findings and recommendations of
the Economic and Social Impact Assessment undertaken following the summer-2006 hostilities.
14.
The ISN had planned for non-lending technical assistance to complement WBG support to
Paris III and focused on two critical areas: building the capacity of the Central Administration for
Statistics on poverty analysis and social statistics, which is ongoing; and TA on financial sector
assessment and public debt management
15.
While the ISN had not proposed any specific intervention to assist with the recovery and
reconstruction of the Nahr El-Bared Camp and the conflict affected areas in the North of Lebanon, at
the request of the Government, the WBG prepared an in-depth analysis of the impact and a
reconstruction strategy, financed by post conflict grants, to underpin the activities to be supported by
a small multi-donor trust fund managed by the WBG. The US$10 million multi-donor trust fund was
set up in 2008 to pass donor contributions for the reconstruction and recovery of Nahr El-Bared and
Beddawi camps to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East. To-date, the removal of rubble in the first reconstruction areas has been completed but work
temporarily halted awaiting resolution of questions on how to deal with antiquities discovered at the
site.
50

16.
An ISN with a limited (15 month) duration was deemed appropriate for guiding WBG Group
strategy. However, the program envisaged for such a short period of time was too heavy to ensure
successful timely completion. The political impasse discussed above extended the period of the ISN
period to cover the full fiscal year 2009. This allowed for the completion of all the activities
envisaged.
Overview of Achievement by Pillar
Pillar 1 - Governance, Economic Management and Growth Support. To achieve this pillar’s
objective, the ISN planned for two consecutive Development Policy Loans (DPL); projects financed
by the Lebanon Trust Fund focusing on building the capacity to prepare and implement reforms in
the electricity and social sectors; the public expenditure reviews in three sectors; assistance in
advancing public financial management reforms; and a poverty assessment.

17.
The DPLs were the centerpieces of the ISN. The first DPL, the Reform Implementation DPL
I (RIDPL), was prepared on the basis of the apparent consensus of all parties on the reforms needed
to reduce the budgetary burden of the power sector, modernize the business environment and
telecommunications sector, and reform social protection. The program was designed to respond to
significant structural issues in the Lebanese economy which have a significant impact on the budget
deficit, a significant cause of macroeconomic imbalance and instability.
18.
The focus of the program was justified since covering its deficit absorbs 20 percent of the
Government revenues. The design of the program focused on short-term actions having a clear
impact on advancing sector governance reforms and financial viability, and on actions aimed at
enticing the private sector to provide management skills and financing to the power sector. These
priorities were suitably selected to achieve the maximum impact in the short term and to prepare for
further improvements in the medium term as the sector reform program was implemented.
19.
The project closed with an unsatisfactory rating with four of the five indicators not achieved
and the fifth one only partially achieved. The main factors which affected the implementation of the
reform program supported by the RIDPL were the political events in Lebanon following the approval
of the RIDPL. This further complicated the intertwinement of sector reforms with the realities of
Lebanon’s political economy. Lebanon’s political economy allocating considerable amount of
subsidies and redistribution of public sector services as well as the lack of agreement on the
objectives of sector reform have impeded progress on implementing reform measures, especially in
the electricity sector. The main reasons for the failure to implement reform are not technical, since
the sectors have benefited from a wealth of engineering and technical assessment reports providing
recommendations for sector improvement and an agenda for sector reform. The situation in Lebanon
continued however to be tense with demonstrations by the opposition paralyzing parts of Beirut for
months, sporadic political violence and assassinations, the postponement of Presidential elections,
the suspension of parliamentary sessions, and a long process leading to formation of an interim
government with its main mandate to prepare new parliamentary elections. This volatility in the
political conditions in Lebanon paralyzed government decisions necessary to advance reforms
supported by the RIDPL.
20.
The WBG had recognized the fragile political environment during the preparation of the
RIDPL and the ambitious reforms included in Paris III program, but took a calculated risk and
decided to support continued involvement in Lebanon as it felt that the WBG needed to stay firmly
engaged with the process initiated at the Paris III Conference. The WBG decided to take a calculated
risk and proceed with the RIDPL, believing that there was a window of opportunity which, in the
end, did not materialize. However, it the potentially negative impact of the fragile political
51

environment on implementation of the reforms included in the RIDPL. The lesson learned is that it
may be more effective to have a series of DPLs (or a multiple tranche DPL) that set less ambitious
incremental targets. Without a strong consensus on those specifics amongst the key political actors,
forward movement proves elusive.

21.
While progress in implementing structural reforms has been slow due to the reasons
mentioned above, the technical work progressed well, largely supported by WBG advisory and
technical assistance work and the TA projects financed by the Lebanon Trust Fund. Three
PERs were completed for the energy, water, and agriculture sectors together with the poverty and
social impact analysis, providing the Government with solid studies on which to build and implement
the reforms, if the political will were to materialize.


In the telecommunications sector, some encouraging steps have been taken, but the
privatization of the sector has been postponed. Political difficulties and increasing budget
deficit have led to the postponement of the auction of the two mobile companies from 2007
to 2008. However, the Ministry of Telecom has taken several measures aiming to reduce the
cost of telecommunications and to enhance the client base of the sector. These measures
include: (a) reducing the subscription fee to the cell-phone lines; (b) reducing the fee for a
prepaid card; (c) awarding the management contracts for the two cellular phones networks to
two private companies for one year renewable; (d) increasing investments in the
infrastructure of the sector in order to raise the capacity of the network; and (e) launching
auctions on 32 distinguished cell-phone numbers which brought US$2.5 million to the
Government.



With WBG support, technical work for social sectors is also progressing, especially at the
Ministry of Social Affairs where the Government is focusing on: (a) elimination of
duplication in service delivery and program implementation among core ministries; (b)
reform and restructuring of the Ministry of Social Affairs by identifying weaknesses in its
mandate, structure and programs; and (c) establishment of a targeting mechanism (see more
details on the achievements under Pillar 2). The Government had launched an initiative to
strengthen the governance and administration. The first Phase of the Administrative and IT
Master Plan was completed and all branches of the NSSF started the automated work. (I
would suggest that we use the achievement und



The Ministry of Finance has drafted laws to reform tax procedures and the GIT legislation,
while taking steps to improve its budget formulation and debt management. The key
measures taken and implemented by the MoF include: (a) the construction of a
comprehensive database, enabling timely issuance of tax schedules and reducing tax arrears;
(b) the creation of a Cash Management Unit; and (c) the implementation of debt management
Law. However, the increase in VAT and some other tax policy measures expected to be
adopted under the Paris III program to enhance the budgetary revenues have been postponed.



In the electricity sector, some initial measures have been taken in the power sector where
work is progressing on the corporatization plan for EdL, although with serious delays.

Pillar 2: Developing Human Capital and Mitigating the Poverty Effects of Transition

22.
To achieve this pillar’s objective, the ISN planned for the second DPL to focus largely on the
implementation of the Government’s comprehensive Social Action Plan developed as part of its
medium-term reform program. Technical assistance was programmed funded by the Lebanon Trust
Fund to complement the DPL and accompany the reform in its implementation phase. The ISN
52

planned to continue WBG support in the education support with the ongoing IBRD project and
support the reform in education finance, reorganize the management of the public education system
and develop a nationally agreed upon education sector strategy to achieve better outcomes.

23.
As mentioned above, the lack of progress on the reforms supported by the first DPL
prevented the finalization and approval of the second DPL which was expected to focus on three
social clusters. However, two technical assistance projects financed by the Lebanon Trust Fund and
AAA have supported the following achievements:










Approval by Cabinet of a Policy Statement adopting the principle of (proxy-means
testing) targeting for its social assistance/safety net programs.
Successful implementation of the pilot of the new targeting mechanism and
commenced preparation of the national roll-out.
Cabinet approval of a US$20 million conditional cash transfer program to keep poor
students from dropping out due to financial difficulties (targeting public schools).
Joint Parliamentary Committee approval of new draft law converting current end-ofservice-indemnity scheme for private workers into a fully-funded defined
contribution pension system.
Completed development of the hospital electronics claims processing system in the
NSSF and piloted in two hospitals which will greatly improve efficiency of the
system once rolled out.
Developed reform options to reestablish financial sustainability of the health
insurance branch in the NSSF, which was sent to the Board for approval.
Establishment of an Inter-ministerial Committee for Social Policy to coordinate
social policy.

24.
In education, the ongoing project places a primary focus on building the institutional
capacity, knowledge base, analytical tools, and readiness to implement education sector reform, as
opposed to engaging in the reform process itself. The following was achieved under the project:








Development of a National Education Sector Strategy following a wide process of
consultation. The strategy is being utilized as the basic document guiding the strategic
directions of the next five year. An Education Sector Development Prospectus and Matrix
was subsequently developed with medium term priorities activities, outputs, and output
indicators associated with these priorities.
Formulating a Medium Term Expenditure Framework and a Program Based Budget for
the period 2009-2011, as a shadow budget, based on the comprehensive financing study
and the National Strategy completed under the project.
Approximately 450 school principals have undergone a professional development
program to improve leadership, motivational, and management skills, and formulated
school development plans.
Completed the automation of the General Science stream of the official examination, and
administered it in June 2009.

25.
In health, the WBG provided technical assistance to the Government to develop instruments
for and undertake integrated bio-behavioral surveys of high risk groups. The IDF Grant enhanced
national capacity to ensure effective tracking of the HIV prevalence among the high risk groups and
prevent the spread of HIV. The WBG initiated a study to assess health equity using an available
53

household survey dataset. The study indicated a higher incidence of catastrophic health payments
among households in the lower income quintiles and in the poorer regions of the country.

26.
In social development, the WBG supported poor and disadvantaged communities, and
specific vulnerable groups through the implementation of the Community Development Project
(closed in 2008); and promoted a fruitful cooperation between civil society organizations, NGOs,
CDR, sector ministries and municipalities to restore a feeling of trust in the Government and its
ability to spend the money well. Under the project, 326 sub-projects were completed.











113 subprojects targeted farmers and helped increase the productivity of their agricultural
land, crops and livestock through vocational training on issues pertaining to better land
and crop management.
Under the Youth Thematic Program, youth groups received training in life skills
activities, followed by youth counseling sessions and referral systems. The project also
offered training that targeted children enrolled and dropped out from school to increase
their academic skills and encourage them to remain in school.
Under the Disability Thematic Program, a disability prevalence study was completed to
raise awareness of disability programs in schools. Teachers in 10 schools received
training on inclusive education techniques.
Women-specific courses were completed, aimed at empowering women legally and
socially through education by increasing their knowledge and awareness, acquiring an
income-generating skill, or developing their artistic skills.
The capacity of NGOs/CSOs was improved with the upgrade of their proposal writing,
financial management and procurement skills.
In 2007, a decree was signed by the Prime Minister creating the Inter-ministerial
Committee for Social Policy which is important to ensure that the innovative approaches
to gender, youth, and disability are included in the Social Strategy.

Pillar 3: Resource and Environmental Management

27.
To improve the management of water resources, the WBG proposed to undertake analytical
and advisory services to help the Government implement actions specified in the Government’s
strategy.
28.
The World WBG has played an active role in the development and implementation of the
Government’s strategy for an improved water sector. The results of the 2004 Sector Policy Note and
2006 Economic and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) have largely driven the Government’s agenda
moving forward. The WBG provided in-depth analysis to support the GoL’s reform in the sector with
a public expenditure review which complemented the poverty and social impact analysis. The
findings of the reports are that Lebanon’s overarching challenge will be to establish trust with
consumers while simultaneously improving performance. Major investments in each sector targeting
infrastructure, management and human resources will need to take place while increasing revenue
from consumers who have little faith in the system and want to see concrete results or credible
action. In substance, the PER proposed a policy matrix recommending:



Improving continuity of supply to achieve 24/7 across the country, while in parallel,
increasing volumes of wastewater collected and treated;
Improving efficiency in the water sector can generate sufficient resources to close the
investment gap in WSS. This is particularly important, considering Lebanon’s limited fiscal
space.

54



Improving sector efficiency through investment prioritization; implementation of Law 221;
utility management; and information management.

29.
The WBG recommendations have not been implemented to-date because of the political
situation described above. A PER discussion was held on October 2, 2009 with relevant stakeholders
(Government donors and civil society). The Government has requested additional support as it moves
forward with the implementation of the medium term framework.
30.
The WBG is also providing financial support to the ongoing Ba'albeck Water and
Wastewater Project designed to connect people to water supply and wastewater services, installing
meters, improving sanitation conditions, strengthening the capacity of the newly created Beka’a
Regional Water Authority, and have the private sector operate and maintain the infrastructure
facilities in the Ba’albeck area. The project has been instrumental in improving the coverage of
potable water and providing better access to water supply and sanitary services. Through this project,
the World WBG is working with the Government in furthering the reform agenda, focusing on the
introduction of an adequate tariff scheme and the involvement of the private sector in the operations
and maintenance (O&M) of networks and facilities. To-date, the infrastructure components have
been completed, and on the institutional aspect, most of the by-laws (of the water sector law) were
issued, but the whole reform agenda needs to be launched within the framework of the recently
agreed action plans and reform strategies.
31.
The ongoing Beka’a Emergency Water Supply Project is designed to alleviate the precarious
conditions of the long-neglected water supply systems in West Beka’a, which were been further
aggravated by the 2006 war. To-date, 95percent of the project is committed and implementation has
just started. The WBG is working with the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED)
in cofinancing this project, with KFAED contributing US$37 million to complete the program's
financing plan.
32.
Under Pillar 3, the WBG had also planned to stay engaged in the environment sector in the
areas of environmental degradation and technical support to the Ministries of Environment and
justice to improve the enforcement of environmental regulation. To-date, drafts of the chapters of the
reference book on Noise, Solid waste, Soil, Agriculture, Transportation, Air pollution, Biodiversity
and Tourism sectors are finalized and the analysis of environmental law courses offered at
international universities and international judicial institutes completed. A major achievement lies in
the Judicial Training Institute's decision to introduce a course on environmental law expected to be
launched in 2010.
33.
An agriculture sector public expenditure review note was finalized in June and suggests that
Lebanon may want to pursue a two phase agriculture sector strategy that first focuses on fresh fruit
and vegetables and agro-processing for domestic and Gulf country markets, eventually followed by
entry into European markets. In order to implement such a strategy, the Ministry of Agriculture needs
to align its functions around services it will provide, the most important of which are related to
various dimensions of food quality and safety. In order to finance this, the GoL may consider
reforming agriculture subsidy programs and reallocating the savings to raise capital spending. This
would be facilitated by investing in critical areas including logistics, food quality and safety and
research and development. In the longer-term it requires institutional reform that involves
consolidating Lebanon’s fragmented agriculture expenditures under a single institution that supports
a single strategy. The report was sent to GOL in June 2009 for their review and comments. A
workshop to discuss the findings of the PER is planned for November 2009 with relevant
stakeholders.
55

Portfolio Assessment

34.
Implementation of ongoing projects and proactive supervision has contributed to
achievement of project objectives in most instances. The portfolio of projects under implementation
during the ISN period showed considerable improvements following the July/August 2006 hostilities,
as a result of a concerted effort by project management units, supported by WBG staff. Indeed, the
Government’s increased attention to sector priorities and the delivery of results to the population
gave WBG staff the opportunity to discuss with counterparts ways to reassess the various
components of their projects and address problematic areas with renewed determination. As a result,
the portfolio became in better health than it was before the hostilities, and portfolio implementation
progress was rated Satisfactory. Today, Project implementation is generally satisfactory and all
projects are expected to achieve their development objectives. A portfolio review was completed
with the Minister of Finance on April 21, 2009, to assess project implementation bottlenecks. The
WBG is also planning to engage in a participatory Country Portfolio Performance Review with the
new government to review portfolio implementation and ensure effective and satisfactory completion
of projects. The average disbursement ratio for Lebanon in FY08 stood at 29.7 percent, well above
the FY08 MNA and WBG averages of 21.6 percent and 21.3 percent respectively. The disbursement
ratio for Lebanon in FY09 stood at 36.1 percent, well above the MNA and the Bank averages of 20.7
percent and 25.8 percent respectively.
Validity of the Choice of Instruments

35.
The ISN rightly selected DPLs as the best financial instrument to support the Government’s
program. In fact, the political stalemate would have made it impossible for any investment lending
operation to become effective because Parliamentary approval is required for investment lending.
The ISN envisaged two policy-based lending operations to advance reforms that were likely to have
an impact on macroeconomic and fiscal balances over time. The DPLs were sequenced to limit
exposure in case of deterioration in the political, economic or security situation. Lack of progress on
the reforms supported by the first DPL prevented the finalization of the second one. Therefore, of the
US$175 million envisaged for development policy lending, only US$100 million was approved.
Instead of a DPL, additional financing for the ongoing Urban Transport Project was approved for
US$69.7 million.
36.
The ISN also envisaged two TA projects to be financed by the remaining funds of Lebanon
Trust Fund. The investment income earned on the trust fund allowed the WBG to grant a second
capacity building project to support the implementation of social protection reform, which was
particularly important to keep the momentum in light of the absence of the second DPL.
37.
The delivery of first DPL operation has been timely, and in line with the ISN, but the
technical assistance operations were delivered with delays pointing out to the over-optimism of the
ISN program.

The ISN focused the Bank’s advisory and technical assistance on building the capacity for
38.
reforms, engaging with the Government on the development and implementation of reforms, and
assisting the implementation of the reform program. During the ISN period, the WBG delivered
several important advisory reports, including a poverty and social impact analysis, and three Public
Expenditure Reviews (in energy, water and agriculture). Most major reports have been publicly
disclosed and disseminated in broad consultations with the Government, Parliament, Private Sector
and Civil Society at large. Lebanon’s relatively free and cosmopolitan media also helped in the
dissemination of these reports in wide coverage, prompting public debate across the political and
social spectrum. The sequencing of analytical and technical assistance services enabled the WBG to
provide strategic and well-targeted assistance. The series of studies completed in FY08 and FY09
have provided support to the Government in identifying options for reforms and building its capacity
to develop and implement the reform.

39.
The WBG also prepared a gender assessment exploring the working environment for females
and the conditions as well as, barriers that women entrepreneurs face in the business and investment
environment. Wide dissemination of the report has taken place with representatives from the
Government, civil society and academia. The report has been publicly disclosed upon the
Government’s agreement.

Management of the Risks

40.
The identification of risks unfortunately proved to be prophetic, with internal political
instability leading to the Government’s inability to implement the Paris III reforms. The second risk
only partly materialized and Lebanon’s financial sector prospered in 2009 despite the global financial
turmoil, with strong capital flows and domestic private investment. However, Lebanon’s continued
high debt calls for a prudent approach to near-term economic management and Lebanon has limited
fiscal space. In the face of the political impasse on the reform program, the Bank focused, as
identified in the ISN as mitigation measures, on building the capacity for reform and ensuring that
the projects in the portfolio achieve their development objectives.
Main Lessons for CPS Design and Implementation

41.
The ISN was designed and implemented in a challenging country context. In this context, the
design of the CPS was generally appropriate. It set up a flexible, demand-driven arrangement around
the Government’s Program. The following important lessons can be drawn:


The complexity of the political environment for decision making in Lebanon should not
be underestimated. In Lebanon, the confessional system of governance and the resulting
diffusion of political authority make such reforms subject to collective action, and such
collective action is, for the same reasons, far from guaranteed.



Establish a flexible framework of activities that can be scaled up or down according to
progress made on the reform program and be realistic about the program that can be
implemented during the allocated time period.






Focus lending in sectors where consensus on reform has developed and provide nonlending analytical and advisory work to sectors where broad-based consensus remains
to be consolidated.
Establish a strategic and cohesive program of Bank activities that is not wholly
dependent upon one counterpart or one instrument.
Maintain a core set of Economic and Sector work (ESW) and diagnostic products as a
basis for scaling up or developing new activities.
Be prepared to scale down or disengage if the momentum for reform has disappeared
and switch to a technical assistance/knowledge-based partnership.

58



Set realistic objectives, and avoid objectives that are unrealistic in the country context
even if they are ideologically noble or current. Expectations of impact of Bank support
should be commensurate with the limited amount of assistance provided. Significant time is
required for reaching a consensus on sensitive reforms after decades of mismanagement and
internal conflicts, and the weak capacity in government administration.



Designing simpler projects and using adaptable instruments are even more important
in today’s context to flexibly respond to challenges and changing priorities. The
Government's implementation capacities still face the challenge of simplifying its procedures
to expedite project implementation.
