EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.

The Central African Republic (CAR) i s one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Following presidential and legislative elections in 2005, CAR’s political situation has
improved. Political reconciliation launched in early 2008, including a ceasefire agreement with
the main rebel group and a peace accord between the Government and the opposition parties have
been concluded successfully. This led to the Inclusive Political Dialogue (IPD), which includes
formation o f a Government o f National Unity; revised status o f political parties, and the
separation o f powers. The IPD, which also aims to ensure transparent and fair national elections
in 20 10, and implementation o f decentralization, shows early promise, but i t s implementation
remains unfinished. Overall, national reconciliation i s progressing, while the security situation
remains fragile.

ii.

Sustained progress will be needed to bring about lasting peace and economic
recovery. CAR’S challenges are magnified by the impacts o f the global economic crisis on the
country’s growth and on tax and export revenues. C A R has nevertheless shown i t s commitment
to sustaining a good macroeconomic program, governance reform, and service delivery
improvements. The Government reached the HIPC Decision Point in 2007 and i s on track to
reach HIPC Completion in mid-2009. Hence, the country’s prospects are good for achieving
development results and improving the quality o f life o f CAR’s citizens, but continued reform
and support from the international community i s necessary to ensure stability.

iii.
CAR’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), covering the period 2008-2010,
was validated by development partners at the Brussels Round Table in October 2007. The
PRSP continues to constitute the reference document for programming external support. It
consists o f four strategic pillars:
Pillar 1:
Pillar 2:
Pillar 3 :
Pillar 4:

Restore security, reinforce peace efforts and prevent conflict;
Promote good governance and the rule o f law;
Rebuild and diversify the economy; and
Develop human resources.

The Country Re-Engagement Note o f mid-2004 marked the re-establishment o f the
iv.
World Bank Group’s relationship with CAR, following a period o f suspension due to CAR’s
extended instability and accumulation o f unsustainable arrears. The C R N remained in effect until
it was superseded by a Joint African Development BanWWorld Bank Interim Strategy Note
(JISN) for FY2007-2008. The JISN sought to harmonize support from CAR’S key development
partners, and to demonstrate their shared resolve to (a) address the country’s aggravated arrears
problem; (b) facilitate access to the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI); (c) support Government efforts to provide basic
services; and (d) reinforce Government action to stabilize the social and political environment.

vii

v.
Many of the activities launched under the J I S N are still in progress. The total
committed World Bank portfolio o f US$76 million and AfDB portfolio of UA 41.8 million
(US$62.6 million) provide targeted support to economic governance, capacity development, and
basic service delivery. Despite huge capacity constraints and an unfinished peace-building
process, the efforts undertakenjointly by the two banks are beginning to produce tangible results.
Going forward, the concessional funding limitations under IDA and ADF respectively highlight
the need for innovative approaches and instruments including trust funds, vertical funds, and
other resources promoting regional integration. Total current and potential financing from the
WBG for the CPS period i s estimated at US$181 million.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), prepared jointly by the World Bank
vi.
Group (WBG) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), lays out the strategy and planned
lending and non-lending support from the two institutions to CAR for the FY09-12 period (July
2008-June 2012). For the first time, the CPS integrates the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) into the partnership. The CPS
builds on results achieved under the JISN, and sustains and deepens support provided through
current programs. The CPS provides support to PRSP Pillars 2 (governance) and 3
(diversification), with limited WBG support to PRSP Pillar 4 (human development). Analytical
and advisory work by the two institutionswill target priority sectors and topics where information
gaps hamper sound policy making and appropriate donor responses. The CPS sends a clear
message that, following i t s protracted absence, the international community i s ready to sustain
support to CAR’Sefforts to achieve sustainable development results.

vii.
The CPS i s selective based upon CAR’S priority needs, the comparative advantages o f
both banks, and harmonizatiodcoordination with other donors. Coordination i s particularly
critical with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and other partners with specific
mandates in the areas o f peace and security. The CPS also optimizes the joint response through
increased‘WBGpresence on the ground.
viii.

By the end o f the CPS period, the following outcomes are expected:

PRSP Pillars 2 and 3, with WBG and AfDB support:
0
Improved public finance management, revenue mobilization and governance;
0
Improved transparency and accountability in natural resource management;
Improved investment climate and opportunities for private sector-led growth;
0
Strengthened economic infrastructure;
0
Improved access to basic urban and local community infrastructure; and
Increased agricultural productivity and commercialization.
Pillar 4, with limited WBG support:
0

ix.

Improved access to and quality of education and health services.
CPS implementation i s susceptible to five broad risks:

TheJirst i s a risk o f sporadic violence in the north and center of the country. In addition,
CAR’S landlocked position in an unstable sub-region makes the country susceptible to
destabilizing influences from the cross-border movement o f armed rebel groups.

0

viii

A second risk stems from CAR’S exposure to shocks and its vulnerability to negative
impacts on its current account, reserves, revenue, and growth. The global economic crisis,
combined with other external shocks and security issues, has had a negative impact on these
variables.
Third i s a risk associated with popular expectations o f the Inclusive Political Dialogue
(IPD) launched in 2008, which promises a return to peace, stability and a better quality of
life. CAR’S state institutions, including the police and judiciary, remain fragile and
underdeveloped. Widespread unemployment, and the perception that the early peace has not
yet yielded tangible benefits, poses a risk to stability.
A fourth risk i s that the legacy of corruption and abuse of power may continue to thwart
effective policy implementation and Government’s ability to regain the population’s trust.
Fifth i s the risk o f Government’s weak capacity to implement reforms.
I n recognition of these risks, the CPS provides support and incentives for CAR to
x.
persist with reform efforts. I t also provides for close monitoringo f the macroeconomic situation
by both banks in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund. In addition, the CPS
provides for projects targeting community development and service delivery improvements, to
help mitigate risks o f instability. The IFC and MIGA will explore employment creation through
expansion of private sector development opportunities. Projects will be designed using emerging
good practice from the World Bank’s Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) Initiative in order
to offset corruption risks, monitor achievement o f results, and strengthen local implementation
capacity. Should the macro-economic situation change in the course o f CPS implementation, the
WBG would also re-consider the balance between investment lending and development policy
lending.

Transition to Peace and Stability in CAR

A Viewfrom Kaga-Bandoro’
Kaga-Bandoro, population 68,000, stretches along the busy road 200 miles north of Bangui. I t is
beginning its rebirth as a vibrant prefecture. Waves of violent conjlict had devastated KagaBandoro since civil war broke out in 2002. When humanitarian organizations arrived there in
2007, more than 22 percent of the population had been suffering from long periods of
displacement and insecurity. As the local field coordinator of the International Rescue Committee
(IRC) described the situation, “More than 28,000 people, who had been forced to live ‘hunting
and hiding’ in the bushesfor about two years, were slowly starting to resettle along the road.
Today, Kaga-Bandoro has drinking water holes, primary and vocational schools, a community
center, pharmacies, a Gender-Based Violence (GB v) Group, and a functioning hospital
providing pediatric care to thousands of children. More than a dozen international NGOs are
now shifting their support from emergency to durable solutions. Their work continues to be
dificult due to the population ’s persistent lack of trust in the authorities.
As security begins to return to CAR’S villages, development interventions are helping to rebuild
trust andfoster community development. I n Kaga-Bandoro today, children talk about their future
and women are finding ways to increase their household income. Organizations such as the GB V
Center are ensuring that victims of sexual violence have access to psychological support and
training to help them generate income. Primary school enrollment is increasing and community
teachers are being recruited.

Marie, a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, explains how the skills acquired at the
GBV Center helped her regain confidence in herself and start a small business. Evelyne, a victim
of domestic violence, describes the change in family dynamics when she transferred her newly
acquired soap-making skills to her husband “He is now producing soap while I cultivate
vegetables, says Evelyne. “He is no longer violent with me or the children and I am able to talk
to him about things.
”

”

The ranks of children attending community schools are swelling rapidly, but teacher availability
remains limited. The community school at Patcho in Kaga-Bandoro prefecture is bursting with
236 pupils served by 3 community teachers. Children ’s enthusiasm, however, is insuppressible:
“Iwant to be a pilot, says Sylvain; “Iwant to be a doctor to help the family, ” says Vincent;
and many othersfollow the chorus.
I’

Kaga-Bandoro is a telling example of many villages in the northern part of Central African
Republic. Afer years of displacement, people are slowly returning to normalcy. Community
projects, youth empowerment, and gender-based initiatives supported by international
organizations are producing results.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RECENT D E V E L O P M E N T S
A. Country and Political Context
1.
CAR i s a country o f some four million people and i s endowed with rich forest and
mineral resources and geographically located at the cross-roads of Sub-Saharan Africa.
Approximately 20 percent of the population lives in Bangui, the capital city. The country i s
also at the cross-roads o f transition from extended instability to a new phase o f peace and
nation-building and economic recovery, for which sustained support from the international
community i s required. CAR’S wealth in natural resources belies the fact that C A R remains one
o f the least developed countries in the world (ranking 178th out o f 179 on the 2008 Human
Development Index), in part due to i t s landlocked position, weak institutions, poor transportation
system, unskilled work force, and political and military crises. The country was an aid orphan up
to 2006, when a spike in donor support was used to clear CAR’S arrears to the World Bank and
the ADB. Overall donor flows have increased since 2006, but the volume o f external assistance
remains largely insufficient to support the country’s efforts to maintain stability and attain many
o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
2.
CAR’S political and security situation remains fragile, exacerbated by the insufficient
presence of central authority in some parts o f the territory. The country has endured years o f
political instability and episodic low-intensity conflict, all o f which have led to the destruction o f
much o f i t s infrastructure and social fabric. In March 2003, the country underwent a regime
change and the establishment o f a transitional government, which successfully held national
elections in 2005 resulting in the free election o f the incumbent President and his allies.

3.

Central to the Government’s vision i s the consolidation of peace through dialogue and
rebuilding o f trust. Peace talks resulted in a peace agreement with the key rebel groups: the
Front de‘mocratique du peuple centrafricain (FDPC) and the Union des forces dbmocratiques
pour le rassemblement (UFDR) in 2007, and the Arme‘e populaire pour la restauration de la
rbpublique et la de‘mocratie (APRD) in mid-2008. The peace process led to the holding o f an
Inclusive Political Dialogue (IPD) in December 2008 which involved the ruling party, all
opposition parties, rebel groups, civil society, and major religious groups. The I P D led to
agreements to form a Government o f National Unity, revise the status o f political parties and the
separation o f powers, hold transparent and fair national elections in 20 10, and implement
decentralization, including municipal and regional elections. The National Unity Government,
headed by the incumbent president, was formed in January 2009, but the short-term security
situation remains uncertain because o f sporadic violence, especially in the north and northeast.
Some rebel movements (the Front dbmocratique du peuple centrafiicain (FDPC) and the
Mouvement de libbration centrafricaine pour la justice (MLCJ)) accuse the Government o f
mishandling the disarmament and reintegration process by withholding financial assistance for
their former combatants, and threaten to end the peace process. In this context, the UN PeaceBuilding Commission (PBC) adopted a Strategic Framework 2009-20 11 for C A R in M a y 2009 to
focus on security sector reform, governance and the r u l e o f law, and support to development
hubs. The prospects for lasting political stability will depend on how faithfully the IPD
recommendations and the UN PBC’s Strategic Framework are implementedand, in particular, on
the successful organization o f presidential and parliamentary elections in 2010.

B. Economic Context and Outlook
4.
CAR’Seconomy i s dominated by the primary sector, which accounted for 52.2 percent
o f GDP in 2008, followed by the tertiary sector (30.5 percent) and the secondary sector (12.1
percent). Subsistence agriculture (28.5 percent o f GDP) and livestock (12.5 percent o f GDP) are
the main activities in the primary sector. Forestry, extractive industries (mainly diamonds), and
export crops (coffee and cotton) contribute a smaller percentage o f GDP, although these sectors
are the main sources o f export revenue.
Since 2004, economic recovery has gained momentum as the country has begun to
5.
recover from the long period of instability. Real GDP increased from -4.6 percent in 2003 to
4.2 percent in 2007 during a period which was marked by the implementation o f key reforms.
Despite decreasing public investment, overall investment has increased, supported by private
investment in the mining, forestry and telecommunications and transport sectors. Foreign
investment increased and regular payment o f public wages supported higher demand and
consumption. Poor infrastructure, insecurity in rural areas, lack o f adequate extension services,
and declining performance o f cash crops (coffee and cotton) as a result o f declining international
prices and insecurity, have led to relatively low growth in agriculture.

6.
Over the course of 2008, CAR’S economy has been affected by the changing
international environment and a number of shocks (breakdown at the main hydropower plant,
with concomitant power outages; the increase in o i l and food prices; and appreciation o f the Euro
against the U S dollar). The real GDP growth rate was estimated at 2.2 percent in 2008 against
pre- crisis projections o f 4.9 percent. The global economic slowdown has negatively impacted
CAR’S exports, which declined by more than 20 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 (Box 1).
Furthermore, weak external financing has led to a decline o f public investment, which contributed
to slowing o f the pace o f growth in 2008.
Economic recovery i s likely to be gradual, with a projected 2.4 percent growth rate in
7.
2009 and average growth of 4.0 percent over the CPS period (2009-2012). Such a scenario
pre-supposes improved security; regular public wage payments to sustain internal demand and
social stability; and greater investment (which i s projected to rise from 10.2 percent o f GDP in
2008 to 14.2 percent by 2012) in electricity, roads, telecommunications, and other areas critical
for growth. This scenario also pre-supposes: (a) decisive domestic reforms, including governance
reforms in the mining and forestry sectors; (b) improvements in the business climate, including
increases in credit to the private sector; and (c) employment gains in the industrial and service
sectors.
CAR has had a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program over 20078.
2009 with the IMF, which has remained on track. The fourth review o f the PRGF was
conducted in April 2009 and discussed by the Board o f the IMF in June 2009. Sound
macroeconomic policy has improved CAR’S performance in meeting the regional economic
convergence criteria set by the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).
The regional monetary arrangements and monetary policy o f the regional central bank, BEAC
(Banque des e‘tats de 1’Afrique centrule), have kept average inflation below CEMAC’s economic
convergence criterion between 2004 and 2007. However, the compound effect o f higher food and
o i l prices in the first semester o f 2008 led to temporarily higher inflation in 2008, estimated at

2

9.3 percent. Inflation i s projected to fall under the C E M A C criterion over the CPS period.
Box 1: Impact of the international financial crisis on CAR
The main impact o f transmission of the international financial crisis has been the weakening of world demand and
prices of commodities, which led to a decline in economic activity especially in the forestry and mining sector which
account for approximately 82 percent of exports.
Forestry sector: I n 2008, timber exports fell by 24.1 percent compared to 2007 and by 36.8 percent compared to precrisis projections. Six out of 9 timber companies closed their wood processing units, resulting in the layoff o f 1335
employees and a decrease o f 28 percent o f the wage bill in this sector, which i s one o f the few formal industrial
activities of the country. The share o f the forestry sector in GDP dropped by 1.9 points between 2007 and 2008. The
downward trend of timber demand i s expected to continue in 2009, according to the International Tropical Timber
Organization (ITTO).

Mining sector: Diamond exports in 2008 fell by 25.5 percent compared to 2007 and by 38 percent compared to precrisis projections. Taxes collected from diamond exports dropped by 18 percent between June 2007 and June 2008.
Several small scale mining sites have stopped their activities while the large mining companies have started to cut
down on their investment and production programs.
Exfernal accounts: Export o f goods has declined by 23 percent in 2008 against pre-crisis projections of 17.6 percent
increase, and are projected to decline fitrther (-17 percent) in 2009. This situation has resulted in an increase o f the
current account deficit (including transfers) from -6.1 percent o f GDP in 2007 to -9.9 percent in 2008.

Public revenues: Compared to pre-crisis projections, revenues losses amounted to 23.6 percent of exports taxes and
3.7% o f fiscal revenues in 2008. Public expenditures should increase to meet the investments and fiscal stimulus
measures needed to support economic recovery and mitigate the impact of the crisis on the forestry sector. This will
lead to deficit o f the domestic primary balance in 2009.
Economic growth: The global financial crisis has weakened growth to 2.2 percent in 2008 and 2.4 percent in 2009
against 4.2 percent in 2007 and pre-crisis projections of 4.9 percent for 2008 and 5 percent for 2009.

9.
Fiscal policies have been marked by improved domestic revenue mobilization and
efficient fiscal consolidation over the recent past (Figure 1). The domestic primary balance
remained positive between 2006 and 2008 due to continued improvement in domestic revenue
mobilization, which reached 7.9 percent o f GDP in 2008, the highest level since 2003, despite the
global financial crisis. Yet tax revenue remains low, even by Sub-Saharan African standards and
any gains have been achieved through fiscal consolidation. Tax revenue i s projected to average
8.7 percent o f GDP over the CPS period. However, in order to maintain a level o f expenditure
critical for ensuring recovery - estimated at slightly more than 16.5 percent o f GDP - the
domestic primary balance would be negative in 2009-10, therefore reversing recent trends, before
turning positive in the outer years. The overall fiscal deficit, excluding grants, would significantly
increase in 2009-10 and remain high compared to performance prior t o 2008.

10. A substantial increase in tax revenues will therefore be critical for meeting CAR’Skey
fiscal obligations, which include:
the high share of public wages in the budget. Public salaries and wages represent nearly
50 percent of the recurrent budget, and constraints in the Government’s ability to meet
these expenses could be a source of social tension and instability.2So far, with support
from donors, CAR has succeeded in paying salaries on a regular basis. The Government i s
also undertaking ambitious medium-term reforms aimed at addressing the burden of public
wages on the budget while ensuring the quality o f public service delivery. To t h i s end, the
Government has adopted a new organic framework for public administration, and a
revised civil service statute including new remuneration and performance evaluation
systems.
the signijkant amount of domestic arrears and debt to commercial banks. Domestic
public debt, including salary and pension arrears, debt to suppliers accumulated mostly
during the period o f conflict (1998-2003), and debt to commercial banks, represents 22
percent o f the 2008 GDP. The Government adopted a settlement plan in November 2008,
but lacks the resources to fulfill the settlement arrangements.
external debt service. Even after the HIPC Completion Point i s reached around end-June
2009, external debt service obligations (Table 1) will s t i l l represent a significant source of
outflows.

’For instance, a delay in the payment o f public salaries in December 2007 led to demonstrations and a
public sector strike, and eventually to a Government re-shufflein January 2008.

11. CAR’S external position reflects the country’s vulnerability and dependence on
foreign aid (Annex 3). The current account balance i s structurally in deficit as a result o f
significant import constraints, and concentration o f exports on primary commodities, which
leaves it vulnerable to the terms o f trade movement. Following the financial crisis, the current
account deficit, including public transfers deteriorated from 6.1 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 9.9
percent in 2008. It i s projected to remain at the same level until 2012. The deficit on the services
account i s also forecast to remain high, as a result o f import-related services and high transport
costs, and the income account would remain in deficit due to interest payments on the external
debt. Projected international reserve fluctuations during the CPS period reflect such vulnerability,
with an average o f 3 months o f imports, down from 3.5 months in 2008.
12. Full delivery of HIPC and MDRI would allow much faster up-front reduction of debt
ratios. A L o w Income Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC DSA) performed in M a y 2009
(Annex 2) shows that, following attainment o f HIPC Completion Point, all debt indicators are
projected to remain below the relevant thresholds throughout the projection perioda3These ratios
are projected to gradually decline over time, assuming that the main risks are controlled through a
prudent fiscal stance, stabilizations measures, and new borrowing on concessional terms. It will
remain important for C A R to maintain a stable socio-political environment, in addition to sound
policies to support improvement in economic performance.

C. Poverty Profile
13. CAR still has one of the highest poverty rates in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite its
considerable economic potential. Household survey data, collected with the support o f the
UNDP, indicate that 67.2 percent o f the population lived below the poverty line in 2003.4 Poverty
was higher, at 71.7 percent, in rural areas, which accounted for 62 percent o f the population; and
in regions that had suffered from armed conflict. It was lowest in the capital, which had the basic
social infrastructure and highest economic activity. According to the Participatory Poverty

3

4

The scenario assumes that CAR reached the Completion Point in June 2009.
This i s based on a monetary definition o f poverty, where the national poverty line i s equal to
CFAF156.079 (US$3 12) per year per adult equivalent.

5

Analysis (2007),5 i t s three main causes are (a) poor governance, with the main complaint being
abuse o f power by state officials; (b) insecurity and lack o f economic opportunities connected to
recent conflicts,6 which have led to the proliferation o f urban banditry and extortion at road
blocks, even in areas not directly affected by violent conflict; and (c) l o w incomes.
14. Promotion of sustainable human development i s one o f the four pillars o f the PRSP,
but the country lacks the means to adequately implement policies and achieve the goals
envisaged in the areas of health and education. Recurrent conflicts have led to a deterioration
o f all social indicators, making it unlikely that C A R will achieve most o f the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. C A R ranks 178th out o f 179 countries on the 2008 Human
Development Index (HDI). This ranking clearly illustrates the difficult living conditions o f the
population and the low access to basic social services. Approximately 86 percent o f the
population has no access to health services, and 4 1 percent o f adults are illiterate. L i f e expectancy
at birth i s estimated at about 45 years, about ten years lower than the African average; and
HIV/AIDS prevalence, which was 6.2 percent in 2006 for persons 15 to 49 years o f age, i s the
highest in the CEMAC zone. Policies to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria
are in place, but the mechanisms for funding and implementation remain inadequate.
15. Human development and poverty in CAR have been negatively affected by political
instability. The humanitarian situation in some parts o f the country remains difficult, and more
than one million persons have been affected by violence.' Thousands were displaced in 2008,
adding to the already 295,000 internally displaced persons and 100,000 C A R refugees living in
Chad, Sudan, and Cameroon. Most have sought refuge in urban centers or in rural areas in the
south, and as a result have been cut o f f from their sources o f livelihood. Food insecurity and
chronic malnutrition are continuing problems, especially in the north, due to low agricultural
productivity and poor access to health services and clean water.
16. CAR occupies the 153'd position out o f 177 countries on the UN Gender Development
Index. There are substantial disparities between girls and boys in access to education and literacy
levels. The ratio o f boys to girls i s 65 percent in primary and secondary schools, and 67 percent
for literate youth between 15 and 24 years o f age. Access to prenatal and childbirth-related care,
and to family planning services, i s limited. The proportion o f births attended by skilled health
personnel i s about 44 percent, while the maternal mortality rate i s estimated at 1,100 per 100,000
births. Women rarely occupy positions o f authority in resource management or political life, at
either the local or national level. Women hold about 11 percent o f seats in the national assembly,
and out o f 32 members o f Government, only four are women. In March 1992, C A R ratified the
International Convention on the Elimination o f All Forms o f Discrimination against Women, and
in December 2004 the Constitution adopted guarantees o f gender equality. It i s also a crosscutting objective o f the 2008-20 10 PRSP.

The qualitative Participatory Poverty Analysis (PPA), undertaken in early 2007, aimed to capture public
perceptions o f poverty.
Years o f conflict have displaced a large proportion o f the rural population and destroyed important
economic and social infrastructure.

11. STRUCTURAL AND SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT AND CHALLENGES
,

A. CAR’SM a i n Strengths and Weaknesses

17. CAR’S considerable economic potential includes: (i)diverse natural resources, with an
extended surface o f exploitable forest; (ii)favorable conditions for agricultural production; and
(iii)extensive mineral potential, including diamonds, gold, uranium, iron and copper. These
resources could constitute a solid basis for diversification and wealth creation, if managed in an
equitable and transparent way. Since the re-engagement o f the AfDB and the World Bank in
2006, the Government has demonstrated i t s willingness to implement the structural reforms that
w i l l contribute to better management o f these resources.

18. The root causes o f slow economic and social progress in C A R include i t s geographically
landlocked location in an unstable sub-region, and i t s weak institutions with respect to political,
economic and social governance. Key challenges, identified in the PRSP 2008-2010, are: (i)
insecurity and weak social cohesion; (ii)
weakness o f the State’s administrative capacity and
political and economic governance; (iii)
a production system badly damaged by conflict;
(iv) poor diversification o f the economy; and (v) insufficient supply and l o w quality o f
basic socio-economic infrastructure.
B. Governance, Corruption and Public Sector Management
19. Governance indicators. CAR’S governance indicators are lower than the average for
Sub-Saharan Africa, as confirmed by: (a) the World Bank and EU-led Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA); (b) the World Bank-led Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the Treasury Audit report; and (c) UNDP and Transparency
International reports on CAR’S anti-corruption progress. Despite these weaknesses, C A R has
made tangible progress in terms o f public financial management, natural resource management,
procurement, the fight against corruption, and administrative reform.
20. Corruption. CAR has strengthened the legal framework for fighting corruption and
improved i t s Transparency International ranking from 162 o f 180 countries in 2007 to 15 1 o f 180
countries in 2008. C A R has also begun to adopt reforms required under UN anti-corruption
conventions. An Anti-Corruption Committee (ACC), including representatives from the
Government, civil society, and the private sector was created in March 2008, and i s finalizing an
anti-corruption strategy. In compliance with the Constitution and a Decree issued in March 2008,
Government members and high ranking officials have declared their assets. An Action Plan to
address fraud and corruption in mining, forestry, and Treasury has uncovered more than 50 cases
o f corruption in Treasury and the Tax Directorate. The Government i s also engaged in a
participatory analysis designed to improve compliance with UN conventions.
21. Procurement. The Government has also introduced a new Procurement Code, and has
established a Procurement Directorate and related regulatory bodies in the health, education,
agriculture, and infrastructure ministries. It has also adopted standard bidding documents and
procedural manuals. An Action Plan has been adopted to improve procurement standards and
provide a framework for donor support in the coming years.

7

22. Public finance management. Tax revenue increases have been achieved through regular
audits o f large enterprises; the introduction o f tax identification numbers and an integrated system
for use by the customs and tax administrations; and major reductions o f subsidies in the o i l sector.
The Government i s currently adopting measures to curb tax exemptions. It i s also strengthening
the customs administration and implementing reforms aimed at identifying adequate transit
regimes.
23. The Government has made tangible progress toward restoring the integrity and credibility
in public expenditure management. A Medium-TermExpenditure Framework (MTEF) for health,
education, infrastructure, and agriculture sectors i s being prepared for the 20 10 budget.
Expenditure control, which has been instrumental in maintaining fiscal stability, has been
strengthened, including restoration o f autonomy to the financial control directorate, and
supervision o f cash management by a Treasury committee headed by the President. Finally, nondonor mandated commercial bank accounts have been closed to achieve a treasury single account
(TSA). Basic functional processes, the regulatory framework, and organizational structures
responsible for data capture have also been strengthened. Accounting and reporting systems have
been improved with the production o f quarterly budget execution reports for the first time in
CAR, using comprehensive budget classifications already used for the 2008 budget and new
accounting classifications. An automated expenditure recording system (GESCO) at the level o f
the Directorate o f Budget i s being rolled out at the Treasury to integrate the monitoring and
reporting o f both systems. Lastly, the 2008 Government Accounts and Execution Law will be
presented to the Courts o f Account and Parliament, respectively, in the second semester o f 2009.

24. Natural resource management. A recent mining sector review conducted by the World
Bank in collaboration with the AfDB confirmed the need for reform o f the regulatory framework
in addition to capacity strengthening across the sector. Previous mining regulations and licensing
practices were found to be unfavorable to investors and to the country. Institutional bottlenecks
also reduced the effectiveness o f mining sector operations, leading to smuggling, marginal
revenue gains for the Government and non-transparent mining practices.
25.
C A R became an official member o f the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI) in November 2008, and published i t s first EITI report in March 2009. A new Forestry
Code and a revised Mining Code based on international best practices were adopted in October
2008 and April 2009, respectively. Forestry taxes are now being used for community
development schemes under the supervision o f an inter-ministerial committee. Permanent and
transparent communications have been introduced via newspaper and radio, to inform
communities about revenue accruing to them and revenue-sharing mechanisms. Lastly, to ensure
access for CAR’S timber products into the EU, the country i s implementing an Africa Forest Law
and Governance (AFLEG) Action Plan to strengthen the legal framework for combating illegal
logging and trade, as well as wildlife poaching. These initiatives are expected to enhance
transparency and attract investment in CAR’S natural resource sectors.
26. Public administration reform. CAR’S public service faces a huge deficit of professional
and technical competencies, resulting in large part from extended periods of instability and
human capital flight. Fifty-two percent o f civil servants are over 45 years o f age, and the
recurrent arrears in the Government wage bill provides little incentive for qualified young Central
Africans to take up a public service career. The Social Security Authority (OCSS) has also
accumulated a backlog o f unpaid pension arrears. Since re-engagement in 2006, development
partners have assisted the Government in restoring core functions, especially in economic

8

governance areas, but a comprehensive reform o f the civil service, including improvement o f
terms and conditions o f service and rehabilitation o f basic infrastructure, remains a priority.

C. Private Sector Development
27. Private sector-Zed growth. CAR’S private sector i s small by international standards. There
are fewer than 25 large companies - defined locally as those with sales o f more than US$2
million. The private sector i s represented by two professional associations the Groupement
Interprofessionnel de Centrafiique (GICA) for large companies and the Union Nationale du
Patronat Centrafiicain (UNPC) for small enterprises. Key issues hampering private sector
development include: (a) low capacity o f SMEs (management, market access and access to
credit); (b) weak business environment; (c) high internal debt o f the Government to the private
sector; (d) tense business-government relations; and (e) unstable electricity supply, which
increases the cost ‘of production. The business environment has improved marginally since 2006
due to the establishment o f a permanent framework for consultation between the Government and
the private sector and the introduction o f a one-stop window for licensing (Guichet unique) and
the reduction from 4 months to 14 days o f the time needed to establish a company. However,
entrepreneurship in C A R i s at an early stage o f development, and few new businesses have been
established. Further, the few existing foreign businesses have been slow to expand their
operations due to unpredictability in the legal and regulatory framework governing the business
environment. Pending private sector reforms include a strengthened regulatory framework, and
measures to ensure greater transparency in the business environment.
28, Competitiveness. Inadequate economic infrastructure and scarcity o f skilled labor are the
main constraints to improved competitiveness. Most businesses are small and informal, and suffer
from a chronic shortage o f electricity, frequent power outages, high transportation costs, and low
production capacity. Conflicts and weak investment in human capital have resulted in a dire
shortage o f skilled labor.

D. Trade and Regional Economic Integration
29. CAR’S progress towards economic integration and access to external markets has been
hampered not only by extended periods o f instability but also by weak transport infrastructure
linking C A R to neighboring countries. C A R i s ranked 172”d out o f 175 countries with respect to
international trade, and i t s Freedom to Trade index i s 5 1.4 out o f 100 compared to 87.4 for the
best performing country in Africa. Nevertheless, through CAR’S membership in CEMAC, the
country has demonstrated commitment to economic cooperation and regional integration
initiatives. The Government undertook several actions in 2008 to promote trade and regional
integration, including the harmonization o f CAR’S Trade Code with regional and international
instruments. (As a member o f CEMAC, C A R applies a most-favored-nation tariff o f about 18
percent; and four tariff bands, with the highest being 30 percent, for consumer goods). The
Government has also started to upgrade its customs infrastructure to facilitate the implementation
o f the CEMAC Customs Union. In coordination with i t s CEMAC neighbors, C A R i s negotiating
an Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU. In addition, CAR i s a signatory to an OHADA
(Organization for the Harmonization o f Business Law in Africa) treaty which seeks to
mainstream a uniform, modernized, legal framework for commercial activities in West and
Central African countries which are part o f the civil law tradition. Under the terms o f the treaty,
C A R and 16 West and Central African countries have adopted eight regional laws -- or Uniform

9

Acts - designed to improve company and contract laws, and arbitration. C A R i s also receiving
technical assistance from IFC’s FIAS Investment Climate unit in an ambitious program o f legal
harmonization designed to improve registration, credit availability, investor protection, contract
enforcement and business closing standards.

E. Sustainable Development
30. Infrastructure. The vast majority o f CAR’S population lacks access to even basic
infrastructure, and low service levels are exacerbated by poor maintenance o f existing
infrastructure. The road network i s in extreme disrepair, and often impassable during the rainy
season. Paved roads hardly exist beyond the Bangui-Douala Corridor (which i s not even
completely paved). River transport (except for o i l products) i s marginal, as the Oubangui and
Congo Rivers are navigable only four months a year. The net result o f poor transport
infrastructure i s that basic goods are considerably more expensive than in non-landlocked
neighboring countries. There i s no sewerage network, and the absence o f latrines and poor
drainage pose critical health risks, including diarrhea and malaria. Urban services such as solid
waste collection were discontinued during the war and need to be re-established. Information and
communications technology needs are enormous. Urban infrastructure requires significant
investment in response to rapid urbanization as the rural population flees lawlessness in outlying
areas. This problem i s particularly acute in Bangui. The challenges in rural areas are likely to be
even more enormous, although data on water supply, sanitation, cooking fuel, electricity,
telecommunications, and transportation are scarce and unreliable.
3 1. More than half o f CAR’S territory i s sparsely populated. Spatial dimensions therefore have
an important bearing on economic development. Conflict and violence resulting from the
insufficient presence o f government in many zones have resulted in significant displacement,
including rapid and hazardous urbanization, especially to Bangui where economic activity i s
concentrated. Secondary cities remain relatively small, but have the potential to become growth
poles. While such concentrations o f economic activity are desirable for economic growth, the
accompanying spatial disparities in welfare levels which accompany the concentration are not. A
three-year European Commission program i s centered on a development poles approach in
secondary cities. The strategy, lending and non-lending support, laid out in the CPS complements
the EU approach by focusing both on Bangui as CAR’S main economic engine, and on poverty
reduction o f vulnerable groups in rural areas.

32.

Energy. Energy infrastructure i s particularly dilapidated, and power outages are frequent.
Less than one percent o f Central Africans i s connected to the grid o f the national electricity
utility, ENERCA. Installed electricity capacity includes: (a) two hydropower plants (Boali 1 and
Boali 2) with firm capacity o f 14.9 megawatts; (b) a hydroelectric and regulation dam (Boali 3)
which i s not yet equipped with i t s 10 MW turbines, and operation o f which has been pending
donor support for many years; (c) a thermal power plant in Bangui equipped with 6 diesel
generators, 5 o f which are not operational; (d) two transmission lines connecting Boali 1 and
Boali 2 to Bangui; and (e) a distribution network. Theft o f anti-pilfering devices, especially for
lighting, and outdated lines severely limit transmission capacity. The distribution system i s also
outdated, with losses estimated at 45 to 5 0 percent o f electricity distributed. In 2008, electricity
shortages led to an acute crisis, resulting in the breakdown o f the Boali 2 hydroelectric station
supplying Bangui. In addition to power shortages and high energy losses, ENERCA suffers from

10

low collection rates, resulting in a dismal financial performance. From the regional energy
perspective, C A R i s a member o f the Central Africa Power Pool, and an interconnection protocol
has been signed between the Democratic Republic o f Congo and CAR. Priority interconnection
investments for the sub-region w i l l be evaluated in the context o f a regional interconnection
master plan which i s currently under development.

’

33. Overall, infrastructure needs far outweigh available funds and implementation
capacity. The Government will have to meet these daunting challenges through regional
collaborative approaches that can lower costs, especially for the transport, energy and
telecommunications sectors. Trade-offs will need to be made between service levels and service
coverage. Providing basic infrastructure services in a transparent and equitable manner will help
to re-establish credibility and trust in the Government. N e w infrastructure development and
rehabilitation o f existing infrastructure assets will have to be combined with improvements to the
institutional, financial, and human capacity required to operate and maintain systems. This will
include community management in rural and peri-urban areas as well as more formal
arrangements, combined with cost recovery, especially for higher service levels such as
household connections.
34. Agriculture, livestock and rural development. C A R enjoys generous water supply and a
diversified ecosystem, but only 4.4 percent o f arable land i s exploited. Some 67.2 percent o f
Central Africans live below the poverty line, mainly because o f low agricultural productivity and
lack o f access to and from insecure areas, especially in the north o f the country. Agricultural
growth has stagnated below the population growth rate since the 1980s. The PRSP outlines the
core needs for revitalizing the agriculture sector: (a) develop the capacity o f rural people and
organizations; (b) rebuild the capacity o f the Ministry o f Rural Development and related sector
institutions; (c) intensify and diversify agricultural output; and (d) rehabilitate rural infrastructure.
35. C A R i s far from self-sufficient in food, even though food crops (cassava, peanuts, corn,
millet and sorghum) occupy 75 percent o f cultivated land. The food crisis o f mid-2008 depressed
food production. More than 80 percent o f the rural population i s involved in livestock, but
production system i s dominated by small-scale traditional practices. The Government’s Rural
Sector Development Strategy Paper (DSDSR) identifies four main challenges for the sector: (a)
capacity building o f producers and their organizations; (b) intensification and diversification o f
agriculture production, forestry, fishing and hunting; (c) infrastructure improvements to support
production, preservation, storage, processing and marketing; and (d) strengthening o f agriculture
and forestry institutions. As part o f this strategy, the Government also plans to undertake a
“Surface Area-Yield Production” survey o f major crops. CAR’S ability to implement the strategy
i s however severely undermined by insufficient finance and low institutional capacity.

36. Environment and climate change. C A R lies across two major climatic zones, the Sahelian
to the north and the equatorial to the south, both o f which are suffering the effects o f deteriorating
environmental conditions. While the country i s endowed with abundant underground and surface
water resources (estimated at 141 km3/yr and 56 km3/yr respectively), both water basins are
experiencing: (a) a steady decline in volume from year to year; and (b) deterioration o f surface
water quality, especially from rivers, creeks, and traditional wells. The Government i s trying to
address the looming environment and climate issues which threaten to accelerate desertification
and a decrease in biodiversity. First, C A R has become a member o f the Forestry Commission o f
11

Central Africa (COMIAF), and has ratified the international conventions on climate change.
Second, a National Environmental Action Plan and the 2008 revised Forestry Code target
improved management o f forestry and wildlife resources. The Forestry Code aims to improve
transparency and competition in the awarding o f logging permits, in addition to ensuring outreach
to communities affected by the granting o f such permits. Under the Code, a share o f the forestry
royalties and wildlife taxes w i l l be kept in a trust account for forest development, community
projects and tourism.

F. Human Development
37. Education. Education outcomes in C A R are currently among the lowest in the sub-region.
Resulting from extended instability, the education system suffered a loss o f teachers, destruction
o f infrastructure, and low investment. In 1990/91, CAR'S primary school gross enrollment rate
was 7 1 percent (1 0 percentage points above the average for French-speaking African countries),
but by 20046, that rate had increased to only 75 percent (10 percentage points below these
countries).' In 2007, one child out o f four had never attended school, and only 24 percent o f
attending children completed the primary level. The conditions o f instruction, as measured by
students per teacher (1 11:l),
students per classroom (100: 1) and textbooks per student (1 :10) are
extremely poor by any standard. Public financing for education accounts for only 3.2 percent o f
GDP, as against an average o f 4.7 percent in Africa. In an effort to reverse the declining trend in
CAR'S education outcomes, the Government has prepared a National Education Strategy, which
provided the basis for successful application to the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative
Catalytic Fund which approved a grant o f US$38.0 million to C A R in December 2008.
3 8. Health. CAR'S human development indicators are well below the Sub-Saharan average,
and health service funding and provision are very poor. About 15 percent o f children are
underweight at birth and 19 percent are severely stunted. L i f e expectancy i s 39 years. Maternal
and 986 per
mortality was 1,355 per 100,000 in 2003', compared to 1,100 per 100,000 in 2000 lo,
100,000 in 199511.Positive developments include a decline in the child mortality rate (0-5 years)
to 176 per 1000 children in 200612, from 220 per 1,000 in 200313. In the same period, infant
mortality (0-1 years) fell from 132 to 106 per 1,000 infants. Immunization trends are improving,
with 89.7 percent coverage for tuberculosis, 83.2 percent for polio, 84.2 percent for diphtheria,
and 99.7 percent for yellow fever in 2007. Under-funded and short-staffed public health
institutions constrain service delivery. Staff concentration in Bangui i s excessive, leaving health
posts and hospitals in the rest o f the country understaffed. Electricity shortages, and lack o f gas
and spare parts for generators, hinder hospital operations. Health centers providing preventive and
basic curative care are run by autonomous community management committees on a costrecovery basis, which constitutes a barrier to access for much o f the population. In the absence o f
the State, faith-based and humanitarian organizations and international NGOs also provide

between 2008 and 2010, by increasing access to health services, and reduce maternal mortality (to

the National Strategic Plan to Reduce Malaria, and the Comprehensive and Extended MultiAnnual Vaccination Program 2007-20 11 (PPAC).
39. HIV/AIDS. C A R i s the tenth most HIV-infected country in Sub-Saharan Africa. The
Government has defined the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a national emergency, and infection rates are
thought to be on the increase. UNAIDS estimates HIV prevalence in C A R at about 6.3 percent
among persons between 15 and 49 years o f age, which i s above the 3 to 5 percent rates in
neighboring countries. I-IIV/AIDS and related opportunistic infections are a substantial threat to
the country’s economic and social development. The most active donors in support o f HIV/AIDS
prevention and treatment are the Global Fund, German cooperation, France, and USAID. Going
forward, an expansion o f HIV/AIDS counseling and testing will be needed to slow the upward
trend in infection rates. Improved blood safety measures are also necessary, as i s better care o f
patients with sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis.

CAR’S DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

40. CAR presented its first full PRSP (2008-2010) to the Boards o f the World Bank and
the IMF in December 2006. The PRSP (see Box 2 below) was also validated by all o f CAR’S
development partners during a Roundtable held in Brussels in October 2007. The PRSP i s built
on four pillars: (1) security, peace and conflict prevention; (2) good governance and the rule o f
law; (3) economic revitalization and diversification; and (4) human development. Gender
promotion and sound environmental management are cross-cutting issues o f the PRSP.
Box 2: PRSP 2008-2010 Objectives, Pillars, and Expected Results
Vision: The Government’s vision, articulated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy, i s to build a strong,
united, and prosperous nation in conformity with the population’s aspirations for peace, security, and good
governance.
Major long-term objectives: (a) double per capita income by 2015, based on strong, sustainable, balanced,
and equitable growth; (b) expand access to basic social services to strengthen human capital; and (c)
establish gender equality, especially in primary and secondary education, by 2015, and eliminate all forms
o f exclusion.
Pillar I:(a) strengthening o f human and material capacity o f the Defense and Security Forces (FDS); (b)
security sector reform; (c) sub-regional security, non-proliferation o f light weapons; and (d) reestablishment o f t r u s t between the population and the security forces.
Pillar 11: (a) promotion o f good governance, rule o f law and gender equity.
Pillar 111: (a) modernization o f agriculture; (b) development o f natural resources; (c) art and cultural
industries; (d) tourism; (e) transport infiastructure; (0 energy sector development; (g) information and
communication technologies (ICT); (h) basic public utilities; (i)economic linkages to the sub-region and
the global economy; and (j) renewal o f the partnership and coordination framework for foreign aid.
Pillar I V : (a) education; (b) health and HIV/AIDS; (c) youth and sports; and (d) employment generation.
Results expected: (a) average annual growth o f 9.5 percent during the period 2008-2010; and (b) reduction
o f poverty to 56.6 percent by 2010.

13

41. The PRSP includes: (a) strong ownership and participatory process; (b) a useful poverty
diagnostic, which drew upon all available data sources; (c) presentation o f sector priorities and
strategies; (d) presentation o f targets mapped to the MDGs; and (e) a high level o f public
involvement. However, the PRSP would benefit from strengthened implementation and
monitoring arrangements and stronger linkages between institutional policies and investment
decisions.
42. The monitoring framework o f the PRSP became active in March 2008; and the
Government organized reviews o f progress in June and November 2008. The first annual progress
report (APR) on PRSP implementation - a trigger for the HIPC Completion Point - was recently
finalized. The APR reflected CAR’S good progress with PRS implementation in 2008, as well as
the Government’s efforts to address the most critical binding constraints to poverty reduction and
growth, in key areas including political reconciliation, infrastructure, the social sectors and
governance. However, the 2008 slowdown in economic growth, coupled with an overall PRSP
financing gap, suggests that the overall ambitions o f the PRSP may need to be revised if the
volume o f donor assistance does not increase.

IV.

DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS

A. Overview o f Donor Support
43. As a result of an extended period o f instability, CAR received virtually no aid between
2000 and 2006. In 2006, a small number o f donors began to re-engage with CAR, united by their
resolve to: (a) address the country’s unsustainable arrears; (b) facilitate access to HIPC and
MDRI; (c) support Government efforts to provide basic services; and (d) reinforce Government
action to stabilize the social and political environment. Official Development Assistance (ODA)
to C A R more than doubled in 2006 compared to 2005 - from US$117 million to US$25 1 million
(see Figure 2). However, the increase was mostly targeted to the settlement o f CAR’S arrears to
the World Bank and the AfDB. That aside, donor support to C A R continues to grow.
44. While the total volume o f aid for development has increased, financing needs still far
outstrip available resources and the number o f partners engaged in CAR remains limited
(see Annex 3). Certain sectors remain seriously underfunded, including health, education,
agriculture and rural development. Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase
in the humanitarian response led by the UN agencies and some 35 international NGOs. The UN
Consolidated Appeal for 2008, for example, reportedly received some US $1 15 million for
humanitarian efforts, largely but not exclusively focused in the north o f the country. A similar
figure i s being sought for 2009. In addition, two peace-keeping missions are currently present in
C A R (UN-MINURCAT; and CEMAC MICOPAX). MINURCAT, which i s based in Chad and
northern CAR, costs some US$315 million per annum in assessed contributions from UN
member states. Finally, the Bangui-based UN Peace-Building Office, BONUCA, has accessed
some US$10 million from the UN Peace-building Fund in support o f urgent peace-building
activities. At this juncture in the transition to peace, the Government hopes that growing stability
on the ground will allow for a progressive shift from humanitarian aid towards more aid for
development efforts. Going forward, CAR’S ability to maintain stability and attain some o f the
MDGs will require mobilization o f significantly more external resources.

B. Aid Coordination
45.

The aid coordination mechanism in CAR i s designed to support PRSP
implementation, which i s the framework for all Government and donor interventions. The
mechanism includes: (i)the National Committee chaired by the Prime Minister; (ii)a
Government-Donor Committee chaired by the Minister o f State for Planning, Economy and
International Cooperation; and (iii)Sectoral Committees chaired by the leading ministry for each
sector. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD’s) 2008
monitoring report on implementation o f the Paris Declaratio~’~
indicated that CAR i s still
far from meeting the Declaration’s objectives. Challenges relate to weak implementation o f
sector strategies; poor traceability o f foreign aid disbursements in the budget; persistent
difficulties in the use o f country systems; and weak national statistical and monitoring capacities.

46. Two recent initiatives will help CAR and its partners improve the prioritization and
sequencing o f donor support in the transition to peace. First, the United Nations PeaceBuilding Support Office’s draft Mapping of Resources and Gaps for Peace-building in the
Central African Republic (December 2008) presents a useful analysis o f ongoing national and
international initiatives as a basis for future prioritization and sequencing o f donor support. Work
i s now underway to further elaborate this mapping and to expand it beyond peace-building
activities to include all areas o f donor support. Second, the World Bank, the AfDB and the
European Union (EU), launched in 2008 a multi-donor initiative entitled the Common Approach
Paper (CAP) to specifically harmonize budget support operations in fragile states from 20 10
onwards. The CAP aims to develop a common framework for evaluating the outcome o f reforms
supported through the budget. A standard Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) between
donors and the C A R Government, and a common matrix o f policy measures are being
l42008

developed, to focus on: (a) the macroeconomic framework (under supervision o f the IMF); (b)
structural measures, including governance, supported by the PRSP; and (c) public financial
management-related measures derived from existing analytical work.

V. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE JOINT INTERIM STRATEGY
The Joint World BanWAfrican Development Bank Interim Strategy Note (JISN) for
FY2007-2008 sought to: (i) support economic recovery and strengthen public sector
governance technical capacity development; and (ii) support human development,
particularly for the poor. Despite huge capacity constraints, an unfinished peace-building
process, and uneven governance, implementation o f the JISN has been satisfactory, and has
begun to produce results (see B o x 3). The key factors accounting for this performance include the
collaboration between the AfDB and the World Bank, including a strong commitment o f the two
institutions to respond jointly to the country’s urgent needs. The two banks fulfilled their
commitments under the JISN, and responded to emergency situations with timely budget support.
This support includes the AfDB’s supplementary financing o f UA 3.797 million (US$5.68
million) for the Economic Reform Support Program (ERSP) in December 2007, and UA 6.5
million (US$9.72 million) for the ERSP I1 in October 2008. I t also includes the World Bank’s
emergency assistance o f US$2 million in March 2008, followed by the Economic Reform and
Good Governance Support Program (US$8 million) in M a y 2008.

Box 3: J I S N FY2007-2008 Outcomes
Clearance o f external arrears to multilateral creditors;

47. JISN implementation also yielded important lessons for future engagement in CAR,
including the need to (a) strengthen the linkage between strategic objectives and specific
outcomes; (b) focus on basic infrastructure and service delivery as priority needs; (c) shift from a
short-term emergency approach to one o f longer-term economic recovery; and (d) assist the
authorities in consolidating peace and security and strengthening the ownership o f reforms by
C A R stakeholders.
48. AfDB portfolio. The active portfolio o f AfDB operations in C A R as o f January 2009
comprised four projects totaling UA 41.8 million (US$ 62.6 million), o f which 29.0 percent, has
been disbursed. (This rate i s 86.35 percent excluding the Program for the Facilitation o f Transport
on the Douala-Bangui and Douala-Ndjamena corridors, which i s a regional operation). Multisector projects comprise UA 12.8 million (US$19.1 million), or 30.57 percent o f AfDB’s total

16

portfolio in CAR; the public utilities sector, which enjoys the support o f the African Water
Facility, comprises UA 1.2 million (US$1.9 million) or 3.04 percent; and the transport sector
comprises UA 27.8 million (US$41.5 million), or 66.39 percent. The portfolio i s young, with an
average project age o f 1.4 years. I t s performance i s satisfactory, with an overall score o f 2.4 on a
scale o f 3.
49. World Bank G r o u p portfolio. In 2006, the World Bank, the AfDB, the European Union,
and France re-engaged with CAR, following five years o f the country being in non-accrual status.
The WJ3 portfolio became active in November 2006, and since that time, the following projects
have been approved: Emergency Urban Infrastructure (US$18.0 million), Emergency Food
Response (US$7.0 million), (restructured) Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDs, Health and Education
Emergency Support (US$17.0 million), Emergency Energy (US$8.0 million), and Vulnerable
Groups Community Development (US$8.0 million) The Bank also supported the CEMAC
Regional Trade and Transport Facilitation Project, with an allocation o f US$24.0 million to CAR,
and the CEMAC Regional Financial Institutions project with an allocation o f US$5.0' million to
CAR. As o f June 30, 2008, IFC had no committed portfolio in CAR, but recently posted a
Representative in Bangui, whose main duties are to help improve the country's business
environment and investment climate, build institutional capacity in regulatory bodies to enable
reforms, reassure and support investors through the development o f an active portfolio, help local
financial intermediaries to develop products for the SME sector, and develop capital markets in
Central Africa. This i s a prerequisite for IFC to issue a bond on the regional stock exchange.
MIGA's gross exposure from investment guarantees in C A R i s US$35.4 million. In the fourth
quarter of FY08, MIGA issued i t s first coverage in the country, providing a guarantee to French
investors for a telecommunications project to develop a Global System for Mobile
Communications (GSM) network and provide internet services.
50. Portfolio issues. The joint WB/AfDB country performance review in March 2008 and the
AfDB country portfolio review in January 2009 revealed a number o f procurement and financial
management issues, including weaknesses in project teams, the impact o f escalating o i l prices on
project costs, and pervasive institutional capacity constraints. Both banks have intensified their
support to the monitoring activities carried out by project coordination teams, and conducted
clinics on procurement and financial management issues. The posting in Bangui o f seasoned
World Bank expertise in sustainable development and fiduciary issues and the staffing o f the
recently-opened AfDB regional office (CAR and Cameroon) in Yaounde also marks strong WBG
and AfDB commitment to capacity development and to resolving procedural issues
(disbursement, non-objection approvals).

VI.

AFDB AND WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY

A. CPS Strategic Objective and Principles
5 1. Support Implementation o f CAR’S Povertv Reduction Stratew. The Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) of the African Development Bank and the World Bank Group
lays out a shared strategy and lending and non-lending programs for CAR over the FY0912 period, in direct response to CAR’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP) 2008-2010. The
CPS reaffirms the commitment o f the AfDB and WBG - the International Development Agency
(IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA) - to deliver on the principles o f the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and
to consolidate results achieved under the Joint World BanWAfDB Interim Strategy Note (JISN)
o f 2007-2008. The strategy acknowledges that C A R has come a long way since the free elections
o f 2005 set the country on a path to peace, but recognizes that that continued progress, reinforced
by adequate donor support, will be needed to sustain peace and stability.
52. Tarpet Selectivity and Tangible Results. The CPS FYO9-12 represents the joint
response o f the AfDB and the WBG to support CAR’s transition from extended instability
to long-term economic recovery. It i s tailored to build on the progress achieved with the
Government under the JISN, and i s designed to complement support from other donors in
accordance with respective institutional mandates. Such selectivity i s particularly important
given the constraints on financing from the two banks (see Section B. below). On this basis, the
two institutions have agreed to sustain and deepen their support to areas where they are already
active and their efforts are beginning to show results: public finance management, transparency
and accountability in natural resource management; strengthened economic infrastructure and
private sector-led growth; and human resource development. This translates directly through two
Axes into joint support targeting PRSP Pillars 2 (governance) and 3 (diversification), with WBG
support also directed to PRSP Pillar 4 (human development). The two banks are taking a more
limited role with respect to Pillar 1 (restore security, reinforce peace efforts and prevent conflict),
given strong leadership by the UN in this area and the more proscribed role for the banks given
their institutional mandates (see Section E).
53. Maximize Opportunities for Regional Intepration. CAR’s small and landlocked
economy i s unable to expand i t s production base without access to a larger regional market and
enhanced connectivity. As a result, the CPS will prioritize regional projects to accelerate the
development o f CAR’s economic potential. In so doing, the CPS will leverage relatively small
country allocations under IDA and ADF respectively in order to access more significant financing
available from regional funds.
54. Provide Framework for Continuity o f Support under IDA 16 and ADF 12. Since mid2008, the WBG and AfDB have frontloaded resources from their country allocations under IDA
15 and ADF 11 respectively to support Government efforts to address CAR’s food, fuel and
financial crises. As a result, resources for C A R will be constrained in the outer years o f IDA 15
and ADF 11. The CPS mid-term review will be used to assess CAR’s emerging development
priorities and provide a basis for lending scenarios under IDA 16 and ADF 12.

55. CAR’s notional IDA 15 allocation (for FYs 2009 through 2011) i s SDR21.9 million
equivalent to approximately US$33 million. This includes a FY09 allocation o f US$15 million,
US$10 million for FYlO and a notional allocation o f US$8 million for fiscal year 2011. The
actual IDA allocation for C A R may vary annually on the basis o f (a) the country’s performance
as assessed via the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment indicators and the performance o f
the Bank’s portfolio in CAR; (b) the country’s performance relative to the performance o f other
IDA countries; (c) overall resources available to IDA during the IDA16 replenishment period; (d)
changes in the l i s t o f active IDA-eligible countries, and (e) lending terms for which C A R
qualifies under the IDA 15 grant eligibility and allocation framework. C A R has made use o f the
IDA Fast Track initiative which has enabled front loading o f 150% o f the FY09 allocation. As a
result, $22 million o f CAR’s IDA15 allocation was committed in FY09. A summary o f WBG
financing from IDA and other sources i s found in Table 2.

56. HIPC and post-HIPC assistance from Paris Club members, in addition to MDRI debt
relief (net o f HIPC assistance), are expected to save CAR some U S U O million per year over
a period o f twenty years. As a result, and given the limited IDA allocation to CAR, no
development policy operations are anticipated in the World Bank’s support to the CPS. However,
the macro-economic situation will be monitored closely to assess whether further World Bank
budget support becomes necessary to complement the development policy operation planned by
the EU in 2010 and AfDB in 201 1. Factors o f concern relate in particular to (i)
possible further
negative impact from the global crisis on Government revenues; (ii)Government’s limited
flexibility to respond to shocks as evidenced by the projected negative domestic primary balance
for 2010-1 1; and (iii)Government’s ability to ensure timely payment o f public sector wages,
which constitute close to 50 percent o f current expenditures.
57. CAR i s also expected to benefit from the regional IDA through several regional projects
described in section C. below (CPS Outcome 5). Regional projects receive 2/3 o f total project
cost from the regional allocation, and 1/3 from the country allocation, with the country allocation
capped at 20 percent o f the total annual country allocation for each project. Given the limits to
CAR’s annual allocation relative to the size o f regional projects, the share o f the project funded
by CAR’S country allocation i s generally limited to 20 percent o f the annual country allocation
thus leveraging additional regional IDA. The notional allocation for regional projects in C A R
under IDA 15 (FY09 through FY 11) i s approximately US$90.0 million. The amount o f regional

20

IDA allocated to each regional project may vary subject t o a review o f eligibility and regional
externalities during the funding stage.
58. CAR i s also eligible for various World Bank-administered trust and vertical funds,
including the State and Peace-building Fund and the Global Food Crisis Response Fund, among
others. CAR i s also expected to be eligible for the Multi-Country Reintegration and Transitional
Support Program, which i s currently being established. When taken together, the total amount o f
current and potential resources available from the WB rises t o some US$l9 1 million.

59. AfDB support will be channeled primarily through the ADF window. CPS activities
planned for 2009-20 10 will be financed under ADF-11 and those envisaged for 20 11-2012 will be
financed under ADF-12. CAR’S indicative performance-based allocation (PBA) under ADF-11 i s
UA 17.72 million (US$ 26.49 million) for 2008-2010. UA 6.5 million (US$ 9.72 million) was
used to finance Phase I1 o f the Economic Reform Support Program (PARE 11) in October 2008.
Thus, UA 11.22 million (US$ 16.77 million) are available for 2009-2010. From that amount, UA
2.5 million will finance the Multi-Sector Institutional Support Program in 2010 and UA 7 million
will finance the Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Project (AEPA) in 2009. C A R i s also
eligible for Additional Resources (UA 11-85 million (US$ 17.72 million) under the Additional
Support (of which UA 8 million will be used for the Community Development and Support to
Vulnerable Groups Project (PDCAGV) in 2009 and UA 3.85 million for the Rural Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Support Project (PARIR) in 2009), and for Targeted Support for about US$ 2
million that will contribute to finance the Secondment and Training Program envisaged for 2009.
In accordance with ADF-11 financing modalities, CAR’S total contribution to regional operations
for 2008-2010 has been capped at 10% o f i t s PBA, or UA 1.73 1 million (US$ 2.65 million).
Therefore, efforts will be made to mobilize resources from regional operations as well as
additional resources from bilateral and trust funds managed by the AfDB, including the African
Water Facility (AWF), the Congo Basin Forest Fund, and the NEPAD Project Preparation
Fund. AfDB resources available to support C A R are shown in Table 4.

C. CPS Strategic Framework
60. The CPS i s built around two strategic axes (see Figure 4), which are aligned with PRSP
Pillars 2,3 and 4.
0
Axis 1. Consolidation of Economic Governance and Institutional Capacity, in response
to PRSP Pillar 2: Governance, Rule o f Law and Gender Equity. The objectives o f Axis 1 are
to deepen and secure economic reforms and strengthen institutional capacity, ensure effective
management o f the country’s resources, and create an enabling environment for private sector
development.
Axis 2. Rehabilitation and Development o f Socio-economic Infrastructure, in response
to PRSP Pillar 3: Economic Diversification, and PRSP Pillar 4: Human Development. The
objectives o f Axis 2 are to ease the infrastructure bottlenecks hindering the rehabilitation and
development o f key sectors, and to improve basic service delivery and the living conditions
o f the population.
Four cross-cutting issues are also addressed in the CPS: State and Peace-building, Environment
and Climate Change, Capacity Development and Gender Equity.

economic governance reforms laid out in the PRSP. Lending instruments include a series o f
harmonized development policy operations (DPOs), including the World Bank Economic
Management and Governance Reform Grant I1 (EMGRG 11) for US$5 million, approved in
March 2009; and AfDB’s Economic Reform Support Program (ERSP) for UA 10 million
(US$14.9 million), planned for 201 1. These operations will: (a) strengthen the Government’s
capacity to carry out macro-fiscal analysis; (b) improve budget preparation, especially in the
health, education, infrastructure, and agriculture sectors; (c) strengthen budget monitoring and
reporting (in particular, the integrated reporting system for the Budget Directorate and Treasury),

23

and production of annual Government Accounts and the Budget Execution Law; (d) build
procurement management and audit capacities; (e) deepen ongoing reforms in the tax and
customs administrations, and improve management of exemptions; and (f) improve alignment o f
CAR’s Anti-Corruption Law with UN conventions.

63, Support provided under the CPS will also reinforce the Government’s macroeconomic
strategy to raise foreign exchange earnings and improve fiscal stability and public spending
efficiency, in line with PRSP objectives. The Government’s adoption o f appropriate policies will
help to improve the country’s credibility and attractiveness to investors, foster competition and
employment generation, and maintain price stability. A World Bank-supported Public
Expenditure Review (PER - FY 10) will help to improve the efficacy and transparency of public
expenditure management, building on the progress achieved since the re-engagement in 2006
with support through three World Bank development policy operations. The PER will also help
to sustain the constructive dialogue launched under operations on improvements in tax and
customs administration.
CPS Outcome 2. Improved Transparency and Accountability in Natural Resource
Management.

64.

World Bank support will build upon the findings o f the WB-led mining sector review
(AAA) carried out within the framework o f the WBG’s budget support operations by supporting
the Government’s implementation o f the new Mining Code approved on April 28, 2009. The
Code i s designed to create a transparent and attractive regulatory environment for mining
companies interested in investing in CAR. The World Bank will prepare a more in-depth review
o f the diamond sector to assess the extent to which the Government i s effectively capturing these
key resource rents for development (FYIO). The CPS will also support CAR’s efforts to
comply with AFLEG and combat illegal forest exploitation and to facilitate CAR’s access
to EU markets.

65. Since CAR became an EITI candidate country in November 2008, the country has two
years to execute i t s EITI accession work plan, and has committed to working closely with civil
society and mining operators. AfDB and World Bank support to EITI ++ implementation will
improve governance and accountability through: (a) Government capacity building in design,
implementation, and monitoring of investment projects; (b) stakeholder capacity building in
extractive industries budget transparency; and (c) debt and data management. The World Bank
will make available US$300,000 from a multi-donor trust fund to support Government’s efforts to
implement EITI. Opportunitiesto complement top-down accountability processes with bottom-up
accountability mechanisms; full transparency of resources transferred between the government
and the mining industry, and enforcement of CAR’s environmental protection laws will also be
pursued. Other potential donors include AfDB and UNDP.
CPS Outcome 3: Strengthened Administrative Planning and Management Capacity at Central
and Local Levels.

66. Developing the capacity of public service institutions i s a cross-cutting issue that i s
addressed in all AfDB and WBG operations in CAR. Additionally, both institutions are providing
technical assistance to strengthen PRSP implementation and monitoring.

24

67. The AfDB supports the development o f public service capacity through the Program for the
Rehabilitation o f Economic Planning Capacities (PARCPE), which was approved in 2006. The
AfDB plans to reinforce i t s activity in this area through targeted operations funded by i t s Fragile
States Facility (US$2 million) in 2009, and a Multi-Sector Institutional Support Project for core
economic ministries and public finance bodies for UA 2.5 million (US$3.7 million) in 2010.
Support will be targeted to staff secondments, economic and sector studies, and training
CPS Outcome 4: Improved Investment Climate and More Business Opportunities for Local
SMEs

68. IFC, the WBG’s private sector arm, will support improvement o f the business climate and
S M E development through its Conflict Affected States in Africa (CASA) program. IFC’s
operations will: (a) strengthen the institutional capacity of regulatory bodies; (b) reassure
investors through the development o f an active portfolio; (c) help local financial intermediaries to
develop products adapted to SME needs; and (d) develop capital markets in the sub-region. IFC
will also develop leasing products, facilitate publidprivate sector dialogue, and provide venture
capital-type funding and services to SMEs through i t s Ventures Program, which i s expected to
provide venture capital to about 50-100 enterprises, amounting to between U S $100,000 and U S
$500,000. Local demand for investment financing i s expected to grow in response to CAR’S
progress toward economic recovery. In the short term, demand by SMEs i s expected to stem
from: (a) construction and public works, with infrastructure projects funded by development
partners; (b) trucking and river transport; (c) logging and wood processing; (d) restaurants and
hotels. Investment demand in agribusiness, health and mining could also be envisaged once
restructuringmeasures in these sectors are addressed.
69. MIGA’s guarantee to S.A. Orange Participationsin 2008 i s helping the company to develop
a GSM network and provide internet services. Given CAR’S transition from fragile to stable
status, companies interested in setting up business in the country are expected to be interested in
political risk insurance, particularly against the risk o f war and civil disturbance. MIGA i s also
ready to provide complementary support to IFC activities in construction, infrastructure
(including energy and transport), agro-industry, manufacturing, and services. In addition,
MIGA’s Small Investment Program (SIP), designed to provide rapid response to investments of
less than U S $ l O million, i s suitable for SME investments in CAR.
70. The AfDB has recently introduced the Trade Financing Initiative and the Emergency
Liquidity Facility, both o f which provide financial support to non-sovereign operations in ADFeligible countries suffering from liquidity shortfalls due to the global economic crisis. These new
instruments will be used to fund trade and private investment opportunities in CAR.
7 1.

F o r Axis 2, outcomes in four areas are expected:

CPS Outcome 5. Improved Infrastructure for Regional Economic Integration

72. Energy. CPS support will help to reverse the serious deterioration of CAR’S energy
infrastructure and supply, and will improve the financial and management capacity of ENERCA,
the energy utility. Complementary French Development Agency (e 4 million) and World Bank

25

(US$ 8 million) projects are helping to partially restore reliable electricity supply from Boali 1
and two hydropower facilities to Bangui customers, including the water utility and hospitals. The
two projects are also improving the financial and operating performance o f the sector through the
introduction o f cost-efficient light bulbs, pre-payment meters, and a twinning arrangement with
an energy utility in another African country. The CPS will also include a US$2.5 million grant
from the World Bank-administered State and Peace-building Fund for emergency rehabilitation
o f hydropower facilities with emphasis on dam safety; rehabilitation o f the distribution network;
and technical assistance to improve corporate governance o f the power sector. Provision o f safer
and reliable power service, mainly to Bangui, will make a significant contribution to security and
public confidence during the important transition to stability. To support energy sector
restructuring, the World Bank plans to use PublicPrivate Infrastructure Advisory Facility
(PPIAF) resources to finance an energy sector reform study, while the AfDB will use t r u s t funds
to finance an Electricity Sector Master Plan study.

73. CAR’s hydropower supply does not exceed 18 M W , which i s far below the demand. To
increase supply, AfDB will support financing for Boali 3 equipment and for extension o f Boali 2
capacity, as part o f a regional project that also includes DRC. When priority investments are
identified under the Central Africa Power Pool, o f which C A R i s a member, opportunities for
providing support from the WBG’s IDA 16 allocation will be explored.
74. Telecommunications. WBG and AfDB plan to jointly finance Phase Io f the Regional
Fiber Optic Cable project (CAR, Cameroon and Chad), which aims to install broadband fiber
optic infrastructure linking Banguito Maddougou in Cameroon over the pipeline linking Kribi in
Cameroon to Doba in Chad, thus offering C A R the opportunity to connect i t s e l f at a lesser cost to
the terminal station o f the inter-continental submarine cable. The AfDB also plans to use bilateral
and trust funds to finance a feasibility study on CAR’s national fiber optic network.

75. Transport. C A R Government’s infrastructure development strategy comprises three
components: (i)reduction o f the country’s landlocked situation by strengthening linkages to the
main regional ports; (ii)diversification o f access routes; and (iii)development o f transport
infrastructure to development hubs. The World Bank plans to provide additional financing for the
Central Africa Component o f the CEMAC Transport & Transit Facilitation Project, which i s an
ongoing project financed by the AfDB, World Bank, French Development Agency, and EU; the
WBG will mostly fund financing gaps from the three other donors and improve the linkage
between the corridor and the national network. The AfDB will undertake feasibility studies for (a)
the Ouesso (Congo) - Bangui - Ndjamena road project; and (b) the Oubangui - Congo - Sangha
River Transport project, as a basis for possible future AfDB funding. The support provided by
AfDB and the World Bank assumes that the Government, through secure funding o f the Road
Maintenance Funds, and the other donors such as the EU are funding the bulk o f the national
network’s maintenance and development in some major cities. This implies that the sustainability
o f the national road maintenance policy and o f the national transport investment planning will be
an integral part o f the donor dialogue with the Government.
CPS Outcome 6. ImprovedAccess to Basic Urban and Community Infrastructure

76. Urban infrastructure. The World Bank-supported Bangui Emergency Urban
Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (US$l8.0 million) supports Government

26

efforts to: (a) increase access to infrastructure and urban services in the most deprived districts o f
Bangui; and (b) deliver tangible improvements in citizens’ lives, which are critical for social and
political stability. Additional financing for the WB Urban Infrastructure Project will be prepared
for delivery in FY10. To scale-up results in Bangui’s urban rehabilitation, the AfDB w i l l seek
trust funds to conduct a study for a Bangui Urban Development Master Plan that will be carried
out in conjunction with a Government-led C A R 2040 prospective study. The A D B has financed,
through the African Water Facility (AWF), a feasibility study on Drinking Water Supply and
Sanitation (AEPA) for 16 main cities, as a basis for an AfDB project in 2009 covering three
larger cities and potential interventions o f other partners. The AfDB’s AWF also plans to
maintain its support to CAR, through an Institutional Support Project for the water and sanitation
sector.

77. Community infrastructure. The AfDB and the World Bank are co-financing a
Community Project for the Development and Support o f Vulnerable Groups (PCDAGV) for UA
8.0 million (US$1 1.9 million) and US $8.0 million, respectively. Expected outcomes include
improved basic local government services, especially for the rehabilitation, capacity building and
equipping o f health and education centers in 9 o f the country’s 16 regions. The project i s
consistent with CAR’s development hubs strategy and addresses central and southern regions.
78. An ongoing World Bank LICUS Trust Fund Grant for Community-Driven Development
and Social Sector Project (US$2.7 million) i s helping to build social capital, provide critical
services, and regenerate economic activity in selected communities. Some 80 community microprojects are close to completion, having improved tangible service outcomes in health, education,
management o f agricultural produce, and market place rehabilitation.
CPS Outcome 7. Improved Agriculture and Livestock Productivity

79. The AfDB and World Bank responded to the 2008 food crisis with projects in C A R totaling
UA3.0 million and US$7.0 million, respectively. Going forward, the AfDB will finance a Rural
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project for UA 4.0 million (US$5.9 million). The project will

target improvement o f rural roads, village water schemes, commercialization
infrastructure, and research. The World Bank will prepare a follow-on rural development
operation for US$lO.O million in FY 12 designed to boost stabilization efforts; strengthen
agricultural supply and food security (through improved planting material and inputs); and
develop local technical capacity to improve productivity, post-harvest infrastructure, and
marketing. Support from this operation would help to strengthen management capacities o f the
Ministry o f Rural Development and the Agricultural Research Institute.

CPS Outcome 8. Improved Access to Quality Education and Health Services

80. Education. Finalization o f CAR’s National Education Strategy in 2007 provided the basis
for CAR’S successful application to the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund for
a grant o f US$ 38.0 million, facilitated by the World Bank. The grant will finance the first threeyear phase o f an ambitious program to meet the MDGs for education. Results are expected to
include improved basic institutional capacity in the sector, but more predictable funding flows
and systematic capacity building efforts will be needed during subsequent phases to sustain
administrative infrastructure, strategic planning, and managerial improvements.

27

8 1. Health. The ongoing World Bank-financed(restructured) Multi-Sector HIV/AIDS, Health
and Education Emergency Support Project (US$ 17.5 million) will continue to help CAR address
HIV/AIDS and provide basic health and primary education services. The project supports service
delivery to civil society, and strengthens the capacity of government to provide prevention, care
and treatment. It also supports improved emergency health responses at the community level, and
provides HIV/AIDs training for student-teachers. The World Bank plans carry out a Health Sector
Finance Assessment to address long-standing insufficient budget allocations to health and poor
access to health services, especially for vulnerable groups. The analysis will also focus on
building more effective partnerships between the public and private sectors for improved health
outcomes and achievement o f the MDG. This will serve as the basis for a new WB-financed
health project for delivery in FY 12.

E. Cross-cutting Issues
82. State and Peace-building. The UN system, led by i t s peacekeeping office in CAR (known
as BONUCA), in partnership with the European Commission and key bilaterals, i s taking the lead
in supporting the high-level political dialogue between the Government and opposition groups, as
well as in security sector work. CAR i s now formally also under the aegis of the UN Peacebuilding Commission, which has played a catalytic role in strengthening support for the peace
process. Strategic support to the political process i s underpinned by work on governance,
elections and security sector reform. Within their respective mandates, the World Bank and AfDB
are also supporting the fragile transition. While UNDP i s taking the lead in demobilization
efforts, the AfDB and World Bank plan to use resources from the new Multi-Country
Demobilization and Reintegration Transitional Support Program (MDRTSP) to create jobs and
support community initiatives in northern areas. 16 The MDRTSP will complement UNDP’s
support to CAR. Further, in support o f peace-building and security, a World Bank trust fund for
low income countries under stress (LICUS countries) i s strengthening capacity and systems for
security expenditure management. Outcomes will include improved understanding o f security
sector finance, civilian governance and oversight. If pending applications are approved, funding
from the World Bank-administered Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) and the State and
Peace-building Fund (SPF) will target community recovery in northern areas, particularly in those
with a high density of ex-combatants. Outcomes will include increased community participation
in local development planning and project implementation.

83. Environment and climate change. The Congo Basin Forest Fund (CBFF) launched in
June 2008; the AfDB-supported Lake Chad Basin Regional Development Project
(PRODEBALT) approved in December 2008; and the Regional Program for Congo Basin
Ecosystem Conservation (PACEBCO) approved in February 2009, will help the authorities to
address critical environmental and climate change challenges. The World Bank i s currently
preparing a Country Environmental Assessment to be delivered in 20 10. From the regional
environment perspective, CAR participates in the GEF-supported Regional REDD (Reducing
Emissions from Deforestationand Forest Degradation) Project for the Congo Basin. The REDD
Project will continue to support CAR’S efforts to develop: (a) appropriate methodology for
16

The program in the Great Lakes area i s the Transitional Demobilization and Reintegration Programfor
the Great Lakes (TDRP).

28

reliable measurement of carbon stored in forests and resulting from deforestation and
degradation; and (b) national capacity for carbon measurement.

84. Capacity development. CAR’Sprofound institutionaland human capacity deficit will take
many years to overcome. The CPS’s Axes 1 and 2 will provide the framework for both WBG and
AfDB to develop on-the-job capacity in economic governance and project management. Through
implementation support, the two institutions will continue to help develop capacity across
implementation agencies over the longer term, focusing especially on core economic ministries
and the line ministries overseeing implementation of joint projects. In addition, both banks will
work with the Parliament and other stakeholders to improve understanding o f PRSP linkages to
the national budget and to strengthen their capacity to monitor CPS implementation. They will
also seek opportunities to mobilize the CAR Diaspora through possible term placements in
Government and semi-state assignments, and through the creation of business promotion
networks. Finally, the AfDB and WBG will continue to assess and address capacity challenges
during the CPS period, drawing on good practice and lessons from recent World Bank country
strategies, including those for M a l i and Rwanda.
85. Gender equity. The AfDB and WBG will make a concerted effort to support CAR’S
national gender equity promotion and economic empowerment policy through their operational
portfolios and in consultations on CPS implementationand monitoring. AfDB’s Targeted Support
will promote women’s participation in socioeconomic development through technical assistance
and a secondment program for women’s associations and groups.

F. CPS Dialogue with CAR Authorities and Participatory Approach
86.

The CPS was prepared and will be monitored using a participatory approach based

on the partnership principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. An upstream

mission of the World Bank Group (IDA, IFC and MIGA) and the AfDB took place in CAR in
November 2008 to discuss the main areas and expected outcomes of joint support under the CPS.
A recently completed Client Survey (May 2009) will provide valuable complementary input for
CPS monitoring, and for sustaining client engagement in that process. Consistent with the
internal processing requirements of the respective banks, downstream consultations were held
between the WBG and the Government, civil society organizations and NGOs, the private sector,
the Parliament, and development partners in early May 2009. A CPS validation exercise was held
between the AfDB and the authorities in June 2009. Consultations provided an opportunity to
engage on the CPS with domestic stakeholders including Parliament, civil society and NGOs, and
the mass media. At the conclusion o f the consultations, the authorities confirmed that the CPS
addresses the CAR’Smain development challenges and provides a sound basis for the AfDB and
WBG to achieve desired results.

G. Joint CPS Monitoring
87. The CPS has been designed with a clear focus on achieving and demonstrating
tangible results, using the Results Matrix shown in Annex 1. CAR’SPRSP forms the basis for
tracking progress on each pillar, with joint emphasis on Pillars 2 and 3, and specific WBG focus
on Pillar 4. Results anticipated from the CPS will stem mainly from current operations and
rapidly disbursing interventions, and the results framework i s closely linked to expected results

29

from the current and planned operational portfolio and analytical work. Efforts to link CPS
outcomes directly to PRSP goals and monitoring indicators remain hampered by weak statistical
capacity in CAR to provide primary data, and slow implementation o f the PRSP’s monitoring and
evaluation mechanisms. CPS monitoring and evaluation will therefore be carried out mainly in
relation to the indicators and milestones contained in the Results Matrix.
88. CPS outcomes will be monitored collectively by the joint team and the Government.
Increased WBG field presence in CAR will help to strengthen the effectiveness of CPS
monitoring and evaluation. Annual Joint Country Program and Portfolio Reviews aligned with
the Results Matrix, combined with more frequent mini reviews, will be carried out in close
collaboration with other development partners. In 2010, a joint CPS Progress Report will be
prepared, and mid-course adjustments may be made in light o f i t s findings, or should new funding
sources become available. A CPS Completion Report will be prepared at the end o f the
implementation period to assess overall CPS results and to draw relevant lessons for future
support.
89. CPS consultations, along with a Client Survey (fieldwork finalized in May 2009), will
form a baseline assessment for helping Government to strengthen domestic accountability
for PRSP and CPS monitoring.Joint CPS Program and Portfolio Reviews will provide a further
opportunity to encourage stakeholder engagement in CPS monitoring, drawing upon emerging
global good practice. Finally, based on emerging good practice from the WBG’s Governance and
Anti-Corruption Initiative (GAC-in-Projects), innovative approaches for initiating stakeholder
participation at the project design stage will be used to strengthen the quality o f project
monitoring and evaluation, and to deepen national ownership o f development efforts. Such efforts
could include participatory budgeting, systematic public expenditure tracking by beneficiaries,
and independent monitoring by NGOs.

H. Risk Management and Mitigation
90. Security and political risk Despite recent progress under the Inclusive Political Dialogue,
CAR continues to face the risk o f sporadic violence in the north and center o f the country. Risks
stemming from CAR’S landlocked position in an unstable sub-region also make the country
susceptible to the destabilizing influence o f cross-border movement o f armed rebel groups. In
addition, groups o f ex-combatants awaiting reintegration and rehabilitation opportunities, as well
as political groups that have been marginalized in the existing political context, continue to pose
challenges to security. Cognizant o f these risks, the CPS aims to support Government’s
commitment to pursue a realistic but comprehensive development plan which looks beyond
national elections in 2010 and envisages providing services across most o f the territory. The
WBG and AfDB will also work within the framework o f support provided through the UN
system, which i s taking the lead in security matters. The joint Multi-country Donor Trust Fund to
Support Reintegration (MDRTSP), in addition to the state and peace-building trust funds o f both
institutions, will help efforts to consolidate peace and stability. However, sustained support from
all donors present in CAR will be needed to address this risk.

91. Macroeconomic risk. Given the export-based structure o f i t s economy, CAR i s seriously
exposed to shocks, and i s vulnerable to further negative impacts on i t s current account, reserves,
revenue, and growth, and thereby on i t s ability to address poverty. The 2008 economic crisis,

30

combined with other external shocks, has had a significant impact on these variables.
Appropriate policy adjustments and donor inflows will be needed over the medium term to help
CAR address its challenging fiscal obligations. I n this regard, the emerging donor
harmonization action plan led by the World Bank, the AjDB and the EU can help to reduce
recent uncertainties in donor support. Given continued uncertainty with the world economic
situation, should CAR’S macroeconomic situation change in the course of CPS
implementation, the WBG would also re-consider the balance between investment lending and
development policy lending in the CPS program

92. Expectations risk. The positive outcome o f the Inclusive Political Dialogue raised popular
expectations that peace and stabilization will soon return to CAR. However, the State institutions
- including the police and judiciary - responsible for protecting citizens’ human rights remain
fragile and underdeveloped. Widespread unemployment, and the perception that the early peace
has not yet yielded tangible benefits, poses important risks to stability during the CPS period
This risk can be partially mitigated by IFC’s and M I G A ’s support to private sector-led growth
and job creation, and through WBG/AjDB projects designed to develop regional, urban, and
community infrastructure - including energy, transport, water, and telecommunications- and
improve the population’s access to basic services.
93. Corruption risk. Corruption and the abuse o f power and privileges continue to thwart
effective policy implementation, poverty reduction, and the Government’s ability to regain the
population’s trust. Despite outstanding challenges, the Government has demonstrated
commitment to fight corruption, by finalizing an anti-corruption strategy, revising mining and
forestry codes and legislation, and passing anti-corruption legislation. Further, the
Government has shown its commitment to enhancing governance, transparency, and
accountability through the adherence to measures designed to fulfill CAR’S requirementsfor
membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
94. Institutional capacity risk. The Government’s shortage of capacity to implement reforms
poses another significant risk. This risk i s mitigated by the support provided by the WBG, AfDB
and other development partners, but long-term investments in capacity development are urgently
needed. This risk will be partially mitigated through CPS activities that build capacity at the
project implementation level, and help to strengthen the capacity of specific government
agencies in charge of implementing reforms. Implementation support provided by AjDB and
WBG will continue to build the capacity of ministries and agencies and project teams. I n
addition, increased WBG presence in CAR, including a recently opened IFC office and new
staff appointments in sustainable development and fiduciary management, will reinforce the
focus of work programs on implementation and achieving results.

I. Scaling-Up and Exit Strategy
95.

I f current trends persist, the World Bank will continue to provide allocations from
IDA; the AfDB will operate under ADF; and the I F C and M I G A will scale up engagement
and actively explore private sector financing opportunities in CAR. Both the WBG and
AfDB will also pursue alternative funding to overcome the severe constraints to their
concessional financing windows. Satisfactory implementation o f the investment portfolio would
provide an important basis for moving forward with the operations outlined in the joint strategy.

31

96. I n the event o f unsatisfactory progress on reform, the World Bank Group and AfDB
would enter into dialogue regarding the basis of future operations. Should poor portfolio
performance arise, the institutions would adjust their operations as needed, revising
implementation schedules and planned activities, or, in the case of severe obstacles, would
partially suspend their activities. Lack of progress on reform would also affect the private sector’s
appetite for investment and thus the ability o f the IFC, MIGA and the AfDB to finance and
guarantee private sector projects. Despite the significant challenges and risks, the institutions
remain committed to helping CAR ensure that the population benefits from development efforts
over the long term.

Annex 2. Central African Republic:
Debt Sustainability Analysis Using the Low-Income Country Framework
According to the analysis based on the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability fiamework for
low-income co~ntries,’~
Central Afiican Republic (CAR) has a’moderate risk of debt distress.20
Thanks to debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative and MDN, CAR ’s external and public
debt burden indicators improve sign$cantly through the projection period. The debt
sustainability analysis shows, however, that CAR continues to be vulnerable to certain shocks
and could breach the thresholdfor the NPV of external debt-to-exports ratio in the most extreme
scenario.

BACKGROUND
1.
This analysis i s based on the forward-looking debt sustainability framework for
low-income countries (LIC DSA). The L I C D S A uses the reconciled debt database prepared for
the completion point HIPC DSA, and incorporates the impact o f HIPC and MDFU relief in the
baseline scenario. The L I C D S A varies from the HIPC D S A because o f three key differences in
the methodologies applied: (i)the discount rate in the L I C D S A i s fixed at 5 percent, compared to
the currency-specific 6-month averages o f commercial interest reference rates (CIRR) used in the
HIPC DSA; (ii)WE0 exchange rate assumptions are used for calculating the present value o f
debt in the L I C DSA, while an actual exchange rate at end-2008 i s used in the HIPC DSA; and
(iii)
the exports denominator in the L I C D S A i s based on the current level o f exports o f goods and
services, rather than the three-year backward-looking average in the HIPC D S A .
2.
This L I C DSA incorporates four key updates relative to the previous one:21(i)debt
relief i s based o n the actual calculations for the HIPC completion point rather than earlier
preliminary estimates; (ii)
the baseline scenario assumes lower real GDP growth, larger current
account deficit, and worse fiscal balance outcomes in the near term, mainly due to the negative
impact o f the current global crisis; (iii)real GDP growth i s assumed to be lower by about 0.7
percentage point over the period; and (iv) the historical data for real GDP growth were recently
revised by the authorities following technical updates, which affect the level o f nominal G D P in
2009 and thereafter.

Total public debt including domestic arrears of CAR i s estimated at 79.4 percent o f
GDP at the end of 2008. External public and publicly guaranteed debt amounts to 56.8 percent
o f GDP, o f which multilateral creditors account for more than h a l f and official bilateral creditors
3.

for about one-third. Domestic public debt (including budgetary arrears and domestic debt o f
public enterprises) amounts t o 23 percent o f GDP. It consists o f outstanding credits to the
government from domestic commercial banks (10 percent), government debt with the Bank for
Central African States (BEAC, 30 percent), budgetary arrears (52 percent), public enterprise debt
(4 percent), and nonbanks (5 percent).

l9See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy
Implications” (http://www.imf.org/externa~np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm)
and “Debt Sustainability in
Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework and Policy Implications”
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2O04/091004.htm)
2o CAR’Spolicies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA), are classified as a “weak performer.”
21 The previous joint LIC DSA was published in December 2008 (IMF Country Report No.09/43).

41

UNDERLYING
DSA ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The near-term macroeconomic outlook i s influenced by the adverse impact of the
international financial crisis. Despite favorable developments for the import price o f oil, the
sudden drop o f timber and diamonds exports implies lower GDP growth and a worse external
current account balance. Along with lower revenue projected for 2009, the additional spending
necessary to consolidate the peace process and finance the 2010 elections moves the domestic
primary balance into negative territory in 2009; however, the primary balance including grants
remains in surplus.
5.
Over the medium and long term, CAR i s presumed to achieve a steady-state growth
path, supported by political and social stability. A sustained improvement in business
confidence and higher investment should underpin these growth projections (Box 4). Growing
exports of a diversified range o f primary goods, including gold and uranium, are expected to lift
real GDP growth to 5.5 percent in the medium term. Stronger exports will help improve the
external current account deficit over time to around 4 percent o f GDP, with financing primarily
provided by private investment, highly concessional project loans, and the regional market for
government securities expected to be launched in 20 10. In order to preserve debt sustainability,
fiscal policy would remain prudent. The authorities’ fiscal anchor i s the domestic primary
balance, which would be in surplus until 2020. The primary balance including grants would be
higher than the primary balance needed to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio for the projection
period; thus, the debt-to-GDP ratio could decline by some 10 percentage points to 20 percent o f
GDP by 2029.

6.
The risks to CAR’S macroeconomic outlook, however, remain significant.
Potentially, political uncertainty and a worsening social and security situation could hamper
donor support and investor confidence. Exogenous shocks, including a prolonged impact o f the
global economic crisis on exports, could lead to slower growth, lower revenue, and deterioration
in debt indicators. Moreover, insufficient investments in infrastructure, such as roads, could cause
delays in private sector investment projects that are needed to boost the CAR economy and
reduce poverty.

EXTERNAL
DEBTSUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

7.
Following HIPC and MDFU relief, all debt indicators are expected to remain
below the relevant thresholds throughout the projection period in the baseline
scenario. The net present value (NPV) o f the debt service-to-export ratio and the NPV o f
the debt service-to-revenue ratio increase temporarily over the medium t e r m due to debt
service payments on new debts following the standard grace periods, but the ratios would
stay well below the thresholds that define an excessive debt burden. All other debt
indicators remain well below the thresholds for the projection period and show stable
downward trends.

42

Box 4: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth: Average annual real GDP growth for 2009-29 i s projected at 4.4 percent,
which i s predicated on sustained security and political stability, an improvement in the country’s
institutional and administrative capacity, and appropriate macroeconomic policies. This
environment should encourage an increase in private investment, especially in forestry, mining,
and telecommunications. Public investment in infrastructure would help revive agriculture, which
dominates economic activity. With these assumptions, the projected growth rate i s significantly
higher than the historicalaverage, which was characterizedby conflicts and civil strife.
Inflation: After unexpectedly high inflation in 2008, the GDP deflator i s projected to increase by
2% percent on average for 2009-29; t h i s assumes that inflation will moderate promptly from the
current level. The projected inflation rate i s in line with the Central African Economic and
Monetary Community (CEMAC)’s convergence criterion of 3 percent (defined by the CPI).
Current account balance: The current account deficit (includinggrants) i s projected to average
7 percent for 2009-29. The trade balance i s projected to improve over time, driven by stronger
export performance as a result of structural reforms and infrastructure investments that will
enhance competitivenessand diversification of the export base; the deficits in the services balance
would remain large. The current account deficits would be financed primarily by official
development assistance (project loans), foreign direct investment, and regional capital inflows
from the future regional government securities market. A major gold mining project i s assumed to
start in 20 11. The new forestry and mining codes should prepare the ground for sustained FDI
inflows in these sectors.
Government balance: The domestic primary surplus would be in surplus until 2019 and then
decline to zero between2020-29. The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) i s projected to
average about 1.2 percent of GDP for 2009-29; with the primary balance consistently higher than
the one needed to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. Domestic revenue i s projected to rise from
10% percent o f GDP in 2009 to some 14 percent at end-2029, mainly as a result of steady tax and
customs administration improvements and tax policy reform to render the tax code more growth
compatible. Expenditures are projected to rise from about 17 percent of GDP in 2009 to about
20 percent in 2029 with most of the increases concentrated in infrastructure investments.
External assistance: Total grants and loans are assumed to contribute about 5.4 percent of
nominal GDP in the long run. Grants are assumed to account for about 80 percent of total external
assistance, with the grant element o f new external loans averaging 52 percent for the period.
Domestic borrowing: I t i s assumed that in 2010, the government will start accessing the securities
markets that are being developed in the CEMAC region. This will allow it to reduce financing
costs, improve liquidity managements, and repay domestic arrears. Given the continued prudent
fiscal policy stance, domestic debt i s expected to decline during the projection period.
Real interest rate on domestic currency debt: The average real interest rate on domestic
currency debt (including bonds from the regional markets) should converge to about 4.7 percent in
the long run.

43

8.
The historical scenario appears much more favorable than the baseline scenario
because o f severely compressed imports during CAR’s history o f conflict. Thus, the
historical scenario i s based on the average noninterest current account deficit o f only
2.2 percent o f GDP, compared to the projected deficit o f 7 percent o f GDP under the
baseline scenario; such scenario would be unlikely given recent trends and detrimental to
economic growth and integration o f CAR into the world economy.
The bound tests underscore potential risks, especially regarding lower export
9.
growth. The most extreme stress test, which assumes a combination o f shocks but mostly
affected by lower export value growth in the CAR’s case, would raise the N P V o f the
debt-to-exports ratio above the threshold for a prolonged period. 22 The debt service-toexports ratio would also exceed the threshold during 2015 -20 16 under the l o w export
growth scenario. The deterioration o f debt indicators under these scenarios underline that
continuous efforts are necessary to develop CAR’s exports, including improving the
business climate for foreign investments, reducing transport costs, and improving
productivity.
PUBLIC DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

10.
HIPC and MDRI debt relief will improve public debt indicators significantly
since public external debt accounts for almost half o f public debt stock. With an
assumption o f lower program grants than in the recent past (0.7 percent o f GDP over the
long term), and with well-managed financing, all debt indicators are expected to decline
gradually. I t i s assumed that the government would continue i t s prudent fiscal policy by
maintaining a domestic primary balance surplus in the medium term and balance over the
long term; mobilizing a higher domestic revenue-to-GDP ratio; and securing relatively
low-cost financing such as highly concessional loans. Accessing the regional government
securities markets starting in 20 10 would help eliminate expensive credits from
commercial banks over the next several years and clear domestic arrears. Under these
assumptions, the N P V o f the public debt-to-GDP ratio would decline from 28 percent o f
GDP in 2009 to 17 percent o f GDP in 2029, while the NPV o f public debt-to-revenue
ratio would fall from 174 percent to 90 percent.

11.
All debt indicators would deteriorate rapidly if real GDP growth were slower
o r debt-creating flows were to increase. Lower GDP growth represents the most
extreme scenario: in this case, both the N P V o f the debt-to-GDP ratio and the N P V o f the
debt-to-revenue ratio as well as the debt service-to-revenue ratio would rise overtime.

22 The combination o f shocks consists o f (i)
Real GDP growth at historical average minus one-half standard
deviation in 2010-201 1, (ii)
Export value growth at historical average minus one-half standard deviation in
2010-2011, (iii)
U S dollar GDP deflator at historical average minus one-half standard deviation in 2010201 1, and (iv) Net non-debt creating flows at historical average minus one standard deviation in 20102011.

44

DEBTDISTRESS
QUALIFICATION

AND CONCLUSIONS

CAR qualifies as having a “moderate risk o f debt distress”. All debt indicators
12.
improve dramatically following the HIPC completion point and debt relief under the
MDRI, but its overall debt position could s t i l l be vulnerable to a variety o f shocks. The
external debt indicators are particularly sensitive to export growth, indicating that
diversifying the export base i s essential for preserving external debt sustainability. The
public debt indicators are vulnerable to slower GDP growth and an increase in debtcreating flows, confirming that CAR needs to pursue prudent fiscal policies over the
medium-term and to consolidate the basis for growth by fostering domestic security,
maintaining political stability, and improving the country’s institutional and
administrative capacity.

Annex 10: Central African Republic: Country Financing Parameters

Date: November 13,2006

The country financing parameters for the Central African Republic (CAR) set out below
have been approved by the Regional Vice President, Africa Region, and are being posted
on the Bank’s internal website. These parameters will be updated during preparation o f
the next Country Assistance Strategy.
Item
Cost sharing.
Limit on the proportiono f

RemarkIExplanation
At this time, all projects are expected to be fmanced at
loo%, given government’s extremely small budget and
inability to provide counterpart funding. In the near
term, only when cofinancing i s available will the
Bank’s cost share be less. Ownership of Bank-financed
programs i s being ensured through a close relationship
betweenthe Bank and the Government’s top
leadership. At the project level, ownership i s being
ensured through means such as close supervision and
capacity-building of government institutions, and
placing project management responsibilities directly in
the concerned ministries.
No country-level limit i s being set on recurrent cost
financing. Recurrent costs may be financed as needed
in individualprojects, subject to project or programlevel assessment. In determining Bank financing o f
recurrent costs in individual projects, the Bank will
take into account sustainability issues at the sector and
project levels, including a considerationof implied
h t u r e budgetary outlays.
The requirements for local cost financing are met. The
Bank may finance local costs in any proportions
required by individual projects.

Any limits that would apply to the

NOcountrylevel limit

Local costfinancing.
A r e the requirements for IDA
financing o f local expenditures
met, namely that: (i)
financing
requirements for the country’s
development program would
exceed the public sector’s own
resources (e.g., from taxation and
other revenues) and expected
domestic borrowing; and (ii)
the
financing of foreign expenditures
alone would not enable IDA to
adequately assist in the financing
of individual projects?
Taxes and duties.
A r e there any taxes and duties that
the Bank would not finance?

Yes

Taxes and duties are considered reasonable. The
application of this general approach will be subject to
an ongoing monitoring o f tax policy and how taxes are
applied to Bank-financedprojects. At the project
level, the Bank will consider whether taxes and duties
constitute an excessively high share o f project costs.
