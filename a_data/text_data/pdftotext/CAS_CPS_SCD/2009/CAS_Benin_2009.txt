EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Benin has a high potential economy but has underperformed in recent years. With a
favorable geographical location, macroeconomic stability, l o w debt levels, and political stability,
Benin would seem to have the foundations for a dynamic, diversified economy. While growth
performance has been similar to that o f low-income countries and to Sub-Saharan A h c a over the
last decade and a half, the country’s economic structure has not evolved, structural reforms have
progressed slowly, and the economy remains highly dependent on cotton and transit trade with
Nigeria. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) completed in June 2008 has established that
the relative poor growth and diversification o f Benin’s economy result from four binding crosssectoral constraints relating to: a poor business environment; weak institutions and corruption;
costly and unreliable infrastructure services; and a political structure that hinders the adoption o f
pro-growth policies.
1.

ii.
Despite the beginning of an encouraging economic recovery process in 2006, issues’
persist on the economic and social fronts that make it difficult to achieve the growth levels that
Benin is capable o$ In addition to political economy issues which have affected the pace o f
structural reforms, the key constraints include persistence o f corruption, an unfavorable business
environment, a weak infrastructure base, and a lack o f competitiveness o f Benin’s agriculture and
industries. The l o w level o f diversification o f the economy and the weak institutional and
implementation capacity make the economy quite vulnerable to external shocks. The business
environment i s unfavorable in important respects for formal production and trade and outside o f
cotton and transit trade, export-oriented enterprises are scarce. Poverty remains widespread and
continues to predominate in rural areas and to be a challenge in urban areas. Social indicator
trends are improving, but the country needs to make more progress towards achieving the MDGs,
particularly in health. Population growth i s s t i l l high at 3.2 percent per year and puts a heavy
burden on the demand for basic social services.

...

The government intends to take advantage of Benin’s opportunities and aspires to
transform Benin into an emerging economy by 2025. Benin’s Second Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, the Stratdgie de Croissance pour la Rkduction de la Pauvretk (SCRP) lays out
strategic priorities for accelerating growth and reducing poverty over the period 2007-2009. The
SCRP operationalizes the government’s five year development plan for 2006-201 1 included in i t s
Strategic Orientations Document (SDO). Both the SDO and the SCRP are articulated around five
pillars. They are: (a) accelerating growth; (b) using infrastructure development as a tool for
growth; (c) developing human capital to improve basic services and lay the foundations for
medium- and long-term economic growth; (d) improving governance, including transparency and
the fight against corruption; and (e) promoting balanced and sustainable development.
111.

iv.
The CAS strategic objectives are in line with the second PRSP. The Bank’s strategic
priorities have been informed by the Government’s SCRP, the lessons learnt from the
implementation o f the previous CAS (FY04-FY06), and from the results o f a Client Survey
conducted in 2007. Selectivity, ownership and government leadership, better harmonization o f
donor efforts, and capacity enhancement drive the program. The CAS i s structured around three
main strategic objectives: (i)
strengthening competitiveness and accelerating private sector-led
growth; (ii)improving access to basic services; and (iii)promoting better governance and
strengthening institutional capacities. The CAS will use a m i x o f instruments, including DPLs,
programmatic approaches (SWAPS),and investment operations. While the CAS i s not a formal
joint IDA/IFC assistance strategy, it was prepared in strong collaboration with IFC and it will
exploit the synergies within the World Bank Group and with other donors to deliver this program
o f assistance.

The new CAS was prepared through aparticipatoryprocess to ensure that its objectives
are closely aligned with country needs and priorities and built on lessons learned. The strategy
draws on an effective implementation o f the Paris declaration that seeks to ensure greater
efficiency and effectiveness in aid allocation and implementation for Benin. As part o f the CAS
process, the Bank has started an exercise o f reviewing i t s comparative advantage through a
strategic positioning tool, in consultation with Government and other donors. The preliminary
results from this analysis, as well as consultations with partners and results from the Client
Survey, have helped the Bank identify strategic priorities and areas where i t s involvement can
leverage support from other donors to meet country needs for growth and poverty reduction.
V.

The total indicative I D A allocation for Benin during the CASperiod, FY09-12, is SDR
191.3 million. This consists o f the IDA-15 indicative allocation o f SDR 142.4 million, and
SDR48.9 million projected for FY12. In light o f the limited IDA resources, the Bank will use
selectively self-standing operations in energy, agriculture, telecom, health, urban and community
development and yearly development policy operations. IDA will also rely on the effective
implementation o f the ongoing IDA portfolio and trust funds to achieve the CAS strategic
objectives. The planned knowledge program i s designed to address some o f the key gaps and
development challenges that remain, some o f which have been pointed out by Q A G in a recent
evaluation o f the Bank’s Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) in Benin.
vi.

vii.
The CASprogram is designed to mitigate risks that could affect the effectiveness of
Bank support. The risks include (i)
weakening commitment to and consensus for structural
weak capacity to implement programs and to promote
reforms to sustain economic growth; (ii)
vulnerability to commodity and exchange rate volatility, as well as the recent
reforms; and (iii)
international financial crisis. The Bank will mitigate these risks in several ways. The Bank will
support Government in the objective analysis o f what needs to be done to move the reform
arrive at significant improvements in
agenda forward, and will encourage Government to: (i)
budget execution; and (ii)
accelerate the reform process in the cotton, telecommunications, energy
and agricultural sectors to improve the medium term prospects for diversification. We will
improve our ability to support reforms through informed outreach to important stakeholders as
well as leverage the dissemination o f AAA, such as the CEM and the telecom study. We will
offer high quality, timely analytical work and technical advice, as well as a selective combination
o f budget support (PRSCs) and investment operations. In addition, partnerships and participation
by civil society organizations, private sector representatives, donors, and other key stakeholders
in development programs will be used to enhance the sustainability o f Bank’s interventions.
Under the IMF PRGF, there will be regular and close monitoring o f the macroeconomic
environment.

I.COUNTRY CONTEXT, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS
A.

COUNTRY
CONTEXT

1.
Benin is a small country located along the Gulf of Guinea next to Nigeria with a
population of 9 million and a per capita income of U S 5 7 0 in 2007 (Atlas method). The country
has been an important transit point for trade with Nigeria’ and access to the landlocked countries o f
Niger, Burkma Faso and some o f the northern Nigerian states. The country has good agricultural
potential, though it has focused mainly on cotton and has exploited less than 4 percent o f the
irrigation potential.
Benin has enjoyed relative political stability and democracy for nearly 20 years, but
2.
suffers from weak governance and corruption. In 1990, the country changed from a MarxistLeninist system to a pluralist democracy, and elections and peaceful transfers o f power have
regularly taken place since then. In the most recent presidential elections in March 2006, Dr.
Thomas Boni Yayi, an independent candidate, was elected President o f the Republic. Legislative
and municipal elections were held in March 2007 and April 2008, respectively. Immediately after
coming into office, President Yayi announced that working for democratic and economic renewal
and fighting corruption would be top priorities. This early statement was significant given the
severe governance challenges that Benin faced and provided a vital entry point for new initiatives
and reforms. The first actions taken by the Government to improve governance included auditing
the main parastatals and government ministries; imposing sanctions in cases o f corruption and bad
governance and taking measures to improve budget and expenditure management. In June 2008,
Benin submitted itself for evaluation under the Africa Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) and has
been championing the process ever since. However, governance problems in Benin are deep-seated
and the campaign against corruption will need to persist over the long t e r m to resolve them.

3.
The political and economic reforms ajier 1990 helped Benin register good economic
performance until 2001. Benin had an average growth rate o f 5 percent during the latter part o f
the 1990s, resulting in modest increases in per capita incomes, as well as in human development
indicators. Cotton exports and transit trade with Nigeria drove much o f this growth. Since 2001,
however, the cotton sector and trade with Nigeria have shown themselves to be increasingly
vulnerable to shocks and, combined with poor policy decisions, this has led to a general slowdown
o f economic activity. Economic growth slowed from 4.9 percent in 1997-2001 to 3.3 percent in
2002-2006. With a population growth rate o f 3.2 percent, growth impacts on poverty were limited.
4.
Benin’s seemingly well-functioning democracy has not provided the political
foundations for pro-growth policies. A recent Bank study’ on challenges and opportunities for
growth in Benin showed that the country’s political structure i s one factor that hinders the adoption
Political parties lack policyo f growth policies. The study identified four main reasons for this: (i)
based platforms and are unable to make credible commitments to voters about their growth agenda;
(ii)institutional arrangements are such that they significantly reduce incentives for legislators to
voters are poorly informed about economic decisions and how
pay attention to policy issues; (iii)
policies affect their welfare; and (iv) citizens have a high level o f mistrust o f government. The
study suggests: (i)Government needs an aggressive public communications program to
disseminate information on policy decisions, how they are implemented and what i s their impact;
(ii)
Government needs to work together with the media; and (iii)
better education, including civic

’ Transit trade with Nigeria i s estimated to represent between 6.5 and 7.5 percent o f GDP.

Memorandum, June 2008, World Bank.

education i s crucial to create a citizenry prepared to make sound judgments about government
performance.

5.
The weak political consensus for major structural reforms has slowed the reform
momentum and hindered economic growth. While Government has consistently indicated its
commitment to far-reaching structural reforms, the momentum and pace o f reforms has repeatedly
been slowed by individual interests and sometimes political opposition. While the current
Government has proceeded with reforms that do not require parliamentary approval, such as in
cotton, energy and state disengagement, recent political tensions between the Government and the
opposition have slowed down parliament approval o f some laws and bills in support o f the reform
program. The President has initiated consultations with the main political parties, civil society and
the private sector to create consensus o n reforms. The Bank i s launching an initiative to raise
Parliamentarians’ awareness and understanding o f key reforms and their significance for Benin’s
growth and development process.
6.
Beyond the political economy issues, there are some key economic and social challenges
for restoring economic growth in Benin. These include persistent corruption, an unfavorable
business environment, a weak infrastructure base, a lack o f competitiveness o f Benin’s agriculture
and industries, an undiversified economy, weak institutional and implementation capacity, and a
need for improved basic services. These issues are discussed under K e y Development Challenges.
Benin’s Government has prepared a Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (SCRP), the country’s
second PRSP which was adopted in April 2007, to address these issues.

7.
Benin’s location provides special opportunities and challenges for regional integration
with W A E M U and non- W A E M U countries. Located next to Nigeria and bordering a number o f
land-locked countries, Niger, Burkina Faso, northern Nigerian States, Benin i s a natural
transportation hub. Since the bulk o f i t s intra-regional trade i s with Nigeria, Benin i s also wellplaced to benefit from renewed growth in Nigeria. However, Benin must compete with neighboring
CBte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Togo to be a key port o f entry for trade. While the Port o f Cotonou could
play a crucial role in making Benin more competitive as a regional transport hub, it suffers from
considerable congestion and delays due to corruption and weak administration.
8.
The Government is set on making Benin an emerging economy by 2025 as presented in
its long-term vision strategy, “Alafza Benin 2025. ” In order t o achieve this target, Government
intends to embark o n a series o f second generation reforms to modernize public services and
provide a competitive environment for the private sector. Government’s objective i s to strengthen
ongoing reforms and make new institutions function more effectively in order to reach and
maintain an ambitious target o f double digit growth rate over the next several years. The key areas
improve the business climate; (ii)
improve investments in human resources;
o f focus will be to: (i)
(iii)
modernize infrastructure, including having a well-functioning, well-managed port and customs
systems; (iv) provide reliable energy services; and (v) raise the quality o f public sector governance
to improve economic management.
9.
The Government’s program of reforms and investments to help Benin become an
emerging economy is included in the Strategic Orientation Document (SDO), a 5-year
development strategy adopted in 2006. In April 2007, the specifics o f this strategy, along with an
action plan, budget, and monitoring system were adopted as Benin’s Second Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, f o p a l l y called the Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (Strate‘gie de
Croissancepour la Re‘duction de la Pauvreti, SCRP). The Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) o f the
SCRP concluded that it provides a good framework for implementing the Government’s growth
and poverty reduction agenda over the next three years. This C A S constitutes the Bank’s strategic
response to Benin’s SCRP.

B.

RECENT
ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS

10.
Despite a dijJTcCult international environment, Benin’s economic performance has
remained broadly satisfactory and macroeconomic stability has been maintained.
Macroeconomic performance picked up in 2006 and real GDP growth rate recovered to 3.8 percent
in 2006 from 2.9 percent in 2005 and further strengthened to 4.6 percent in 2007 reflecting a
rebound in cotton and services sectors. Real GDP growth i s expected to reach 5.1 percent in 2008.
Inflation was under the WAEMU convergence criterion o f 3.0 percent for 2003-06 due to strong
fiscal discipline and a prudent monetary policy at the regional level. While Benin, like other
WAEMU countries, was hit hard by the rising world market prices for food and o i l during the
latter part o f 2007 and early 2008, the falling prices over the past few months have brought some
relief.
11.
Agriculture, trade, transport and other services were the main sources of growth in
Benin over the past decade, while industry output stagnated (Table 1). Agricultural output growth
added almost 2 percentage points to annual real growth, while growth in services added a little
more than 2 percentage points. By contrast, industrial production including manufacturing and
construction stagnated, and returns in these sectors were low. Over the years, the economy also
grew primarily through accumulation o f factors rather than efficiency improvements. In the 1990s,
total factor productivity growth (TFP) was positive reflecting the dividends from structural
reforms, but since the end o f the 1990s productivity growth has tumed negative as reforms slowed.
Government’s macro objectives, therefore, seek to build on the growth sectors through accelerated
reforms while seeking to reverse the declining TFP through structural reforms and infrastructure
investments (para 26).

Despite a decrease in export volumes and higher oilprices, the external current account
deficit (excluding current official grants) remained broadly in line with the IMF-supported
program targets at 6.9 percent o f GDP in 2007 as compared with 7.9 percent o f GDP in 2004. As a
result, the overall balance o f payments improved from -3.2 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 3.1 percent
o f GDP in 2007. Debt cancellation under HIPC and MDRI initiatives and improved debt
management helped to steadily reduce the country’s total public external debt from 58.3 percent in
2000 to around 11.9 percent o f GDP at end-2007.

13.
The fiscal situation has continued to improve thanks to a strong revenue performance.
Fiscal revenue has gradually increased from 16.4 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 16.8 percent o f GDP
-5-

in 2006 and 20.6 percent o f GDP in 2007. This revenue performance combined with lower than
projected investment expenditures in 2007 led to a slight improvement in the fiscal deficit which
narrowed from 4.6 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 1.4 percent o f GDP in 2007.

I n summary, macroeconomic management has remained sound despite delays and
14.
reversals in some structural reforms. The macro performance under the three-year Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement approved by the IMF Board in August 2005
has been satisfactory with strong fiscal performance, containment o f inflation, and satisfactory,
albeit lower than expected, growth. However, delays in some key structural reforms continue to
pose development challenges that need to be addressed to achieve higher growth rates and
sustained poverty reduction.

SOCIAL CONTEXT,
POVERTY
AND COUNTRY
STATUS VIS-A-VIS THE MDGs

15.
Benin remains a verypoor country. Per capita incomes are l o w averaging US$570 in
2007 and the country ranks 163 out o f 177 countries according to the 2007 UN Human
Development Report. During the first PRSP, per capita GDP growth was small but positive and
non monetary poverty dropped from 43 to 40 percent between 2002 and 2006. Survey results also
indicate that perceptions o f poverty have improved slightly in households’ self-assessment o f wellbeing. The two recent PRSP progress reports estimate the monetary poverty rate at 37.4 percent in
2006.

As in most countries, poverty is higher in the rural areas. The incidence o f non-monetary
16.
poverty in rural areas stood at 58.3 percent in 2006 compared with 18.4 percent in urban areas.
Overall inequality, as measured by the Gini index, declined from 2002 to 2006, although the
national picture hides contrasting trends for urban and rural areas. With Benin experiencing more
rapid urbanization, and thus movement from higher to lower poverty areas, income disparity within
urban areas i s increasing. The Bank will undertake analytical work o n poverty early in the CAS
period to update information on the poverty trends.
17.
The country has steadily improved access to basic social services, in particular in the
education, health, and water sectors. Benin has achieved universal access to the first year o f
primary education. Between 2001 and 2006, primary school enrollment increased by more than 18
percent and the education system has proved able to accommodate an increasing number o f
primary students. W h i l e the primary completion rate rose from 44 percent in 2001 to 66 percent in
2006, reducing the dropout rate remains a key priority for Government if the education-related
MDG i s to be reached by 2015. Gender disparity has been significantly reduced, particularly at the
primary level, but the trend needs to be extended to secondary and tertiary levels.
I n the health sector, the indicators have improved slightly during the last five years.
18.
Geographical access to health services increased to 86 percent in 2006 while child and maternal ,
mortality was significantly reduced over the same period. At less than two percent, the HIV/AIDS
prevalence i s in the lower range o f countries in the region. However, malnutrition o f children
under five remains very high and hampers human capital formation and economic development.
While Benin’s commitment to nutrition started earlier than in most other countries in the subregion, nutrition action has suffered from inter-sectoral paralysis. Renewed attention for
consolidated and effective action i s warranted from the Government. Maternal and infant mortality
are s t i l l lagging behind MDG standards despite recent progress3. T h e rapid rate o f population
growth, at 3.2 percent per year, constitutes a significant obstacle to reducing poverty and
maintaining maternal health. T o reduce the rate, the government will need to accelerate
implementation o f the National Population Policy and reinforce the synergies between reproductive
The maternal mortality rate was estimated at 397 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2006 while the child
mortality rate was 125 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2006.

health services and education (in particular girls’ education), the economic empowerment o f
women, and access to adequate family planning programs.
19.
The Government has made signiflcantprogress in increasing access to potable water for
the rural population, from 35 percent in 2002 to 46.5 percent in 2007, and water facilities
functionality rate has improved from 75 percent in 2002 to 87 percent in 2007. This has been
particularly important for addressing gender issues and reducing the burden on females. However,
maintaining these trends will require substantial resources for new construction and maintenance,
along with community participation to improve the quality o f basic services that will continue to be
supported during the CAS period.
20.
Achieving the MDGs remains a signijkant challenge and will require sustained growth
and improvements in the efficiency o f public service delivery as well as in funding (Table 2).
Benin i s one o f 10 pilot countries included in the initiative o f the UN Secretary General to support
the implementation o f commitments to achieve the MDGs. The main objective o f the initiative i s
to mobilize the additional resources needed to this end. A costing exercise carried out by the
Government with UNDP assistance estimates Benin’s total financial needs to meet the MDGs as o f
2006 to represent CFAF 11,894 billion, the equivalent o f US$300 per year, per person until 2015.4

11. THE GOVERNMENT’S GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION
PROGRAM
A.

GOVERNMENT’S
GROWTH
STRATEGY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

21.
Implementation of the country’s first PRSP, from 2003-2005, was mixed. W h i l e Benin
maintained a stable macroeconomic framework and improved some key social indicators,
economic performance was much weaker than envisaged and n o real progress was made in
reducing poverty (see paragraphs 3 and 15). Progress in strengthening institutional capacities and
improving governance was also mixed with strong results in improving public finance management
but little progress in advancing public administrative and judicial system reforms.
22.
I n October 2006, the Government published the Strategic Development Orientations
(SDO) which defines the developmentpolicy framework for 2006-2011 to put Benin on a path to
becoming an emerging economy. The SDO has two fundamental objectives: (i)creating and
reducing poverty
stimulating growth and development poles by improving competitiveness; and (ii)
and improving the quality o f life o f the population. The SDO includes a growth scenario that would
lead to a quadrupling o f the GDP per capita by 2025. T o be able to achieve this ambitious GDP per
capita growth rate, Government i s seeking to change profoundly the structure o f the economy,
diversify, and identify new growth poles it will have to support.
23.
The Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (SCRP), is based on the main elements of
the S D O and lessons from thefirst PRSP. The Government believes that there can be no effective
poverty reduction without emphasizing and accelerating growth, which it has made the focus o f i t s
strategy. The SCRP was adopted in April 2007 as Benin’s second generation PRSP and as i t s three
year strategy (2007-2009) to implement the SDO. The SCRP, together with i t s Priority Action
Plan, has been built around five strategic pillars linked to the SDO priority areas o f intervention:
Pillar 1 - Accelerating growth. Under this pillar, Government has identified five priority
areas for direct intervention to intensify growth: (i)stabilization o f the macroeconomic
framework; (ii)promotion o f the private sector through enterprise and entrepreneurship
development; (iii)identification o f new growth poles and promotion o f potential export
activities; (iv) adjusting fiscal policy to support economic development; and (v) promotion o f
regional integration.
Pillar 2 - Infrastructure development. This pillar emphasizes the importance o f
infrastructure for linkmg farmers and producers to markets, reducing factor costs, and
improving competitiveness and growth potential o f the economy. This pillar stresses reliable
and cost-effective supply o f electricity, improved transport and port infrastructure, and
accessible telecoms services. T h e top three priority infrastructure sectors to be supported
during the SCRP period are transport infrastructure, energy, and water and sanitation.
Pillar 3 - Developing human capital and improving basic services. The Government intends
to act in four priority areas o f intervention, namely: (i)
enhancing the quality o f education
strengthening professional education to develop the s k i l l s needed in the labor
services; (ii)
market; (iii)
increasing access to quality health and nutrition services; and (iv) strengthening
social solidarity and protection.
Pillar 4 - Improving governance and transparency and fighting corruption. The objective
i s to promote the private sector and improve the effectiveness o f government actions and
expenditures. The top three priority programs under this pillar are: (i)speeding up
administrative reforms; (ii)
strengthening the r u l e o f law; and (iii)reforming rules and
procedures that negatively affect the business environment.
-6-

0

Pillar 5 - Promoting balanced and sustainable development. The objective i s to promote
greater territorial equity, as a means o f protecting the environment, and sustainable
management o f natural resources. The two broad areas o f intervention are: (i)increasing
financial transfers to localities and training for local officials in managing budgets and
sustainable development plans; and (ii)
investing in regional development centers that would
provide infrastructure, serving the development needs o f several communities in a given
region.

24.
While the SCRP provides an adequate framework for accelerating growth and fighting
poverty, it needs further refinement in some key areas, according to the Joint Staff Advisory
Note (JSAN). The SCRP puts renewed focus on economic diversification as key to accelerate
growth. However, it does not describe the actions to operationalize the diversification strategy. In
particular, i t does not clarify how the Government would address the main bottlenecks to the
development and diversification o f the agriculture sector, such as high cost and poor quality o f
infrastructure services, lack o f technologies and knowledge, and poor quality o f agricultural
products. Also, given the port’s critical economic role, the strategy needs to clarify how
institutional reforms and MCA-supported investments will improve competitiveness. Regarding the
mixed results in the social sectors, the JSAN concludes that the strategy should improve the
institutional framework, budget management, and personnel management for basic services.
Government’s challenge in this area will be to simplify and prioritize the SCRP’s Priority Action
Plan and to incorporate key actions in the proposed sector program budgets and related MediumTerm Expenditure Framework. This will help make the strategy operational.

B.

ECONOMIC
PROSPECTS AND K E Y DEVELOPMENT
CHALLENGES

Macroeconomic outlook
25.
Despite the world-wide economic slowdown, the Bank and IMF expect that Government
plans to accelerate reforms and robust levels of trade with Nigeria will help real GDP growth
rate progressively recover from 3.8 percent in 2005-2007 to reach 5.7 percent in 2008-2012
(Table 3). In the short term, Benin’s recovery i s expected to be resilient due to the renewed impetus
o f reforms in the Port o f Cotonou, energy, telecommunications and cotton, as well as increased
public investments in economic infrastructure. Furthermore, current projections indicate that
Nigeria’s transit trade with Benin will remain fairly robust and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) i s
expected to hold up given ongoing projects and Benin’s long-term growth prospects. However, if
the international environment remains sluggish, with demand for exports and financial flows
continuing to be weak, and commodity prices and exchange rates being volatile, this could dampen
Benin’s economic prospects. Other possible shocks could include poor agricultural production due
to weather conditions, and capital outflows due to loss o f confidence. Furthermore, a protracted
global economic downturn could lead to slower growth in Benin over the medium term. Despite
these risks, a joint Bank and lMF review o f the macroeconomic situation in September 2008 has
concluded that the macroeconomic framework i s broadly adequate.

26.
According to the SCRP, economic growth in Benin will be driven by: (i) a more dynamic
services sector; (ii) a pick-up in agricultural production; and (iii) an increase in public
investments in infrastructure. In this context, the authorities intend to pursue and improve
commercial relations with Nigeria to facilitate transit trade and re-exports. Reforms such as
improvements in the efficiency o f operations o f the Cotonou port, measures to improve the
business climate, would spur growth in trade and services and private sector investments.
Government will encourage agricultural production for domestic consumption (food crops) and for
exports (cotton, pineapples, o i l palm, etc.). W h i l e cotton sector reform had stalled until recently
Government has restarted the reform process and intends to pursue a more
(see box l),
comprehensive reform program that should see the sector turning around from the 2009/10 season.
Finally, improvements and expansion in public infrastructure investments (energy,
telecommunications and transport) should help restore industrial and service sectors. These
additional measures are expected to counteract some o f the downturn expected with the current
world-wide recession and financial crises.
27.
The investment ratio i s projected to increase from 21.4 percent in 2007 to 24.3 percent in
2010 fuelled by an ambitious public investment program and to a lesser extent by private
investment. The external current account deficit i s expected to slightly improve to 7.5 percent o f
GDP in 2010 after a sharp deterioration in 2008-09 (9.7 percent on average) as a result o f severe
exogenous shocks. The overall fiscal deficit (on a payment order basis and excluding grants) would
widen from 1.4 percent o f GDP in 2007 to about 4.2 percent o f GDP in 2008-10 reflecting
increased social and development expenditures required for the implementation o f the strategy’s
Priority Action Plan. Total expenditures would increase from 22 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 24.2
percent o f GDP by 2010, o f which 48 percent would be allocated to priority sectors. External
conditions are likely to remain challenging and pose significant risks to the above macroeconomic
outlook.
28.
The preliminary results of the 2008 debt sustainability analysis conducted by the Bank
and IMF confirm that Benin’s debt is sustainable. Debt cancellation under the Heavily Indebted

-8-

Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)’ coupled with
a prudent borrowing policy have helped reduce the country’s total public external debt from 58.3
percent o f GDP in 2000 to around 12.5 percent o f GDP at end-2007. However, although the risks to
medium-term debt sustainability are estimated to remain moderate, the DSA stresses the
importance o f government maintaining a prudent borrowing policy and borrowing only on
concessional terms.

Box 1 Cotton Sector Reform
Background. Cotton remains Benin’s top export commodity and accounts for about 40-50 percent o f
merchandise exports and 10-15 percent o f GDP. Though cotton has dominated Benin’s economy for years,
production and exports have plummeted in recent years due to adverse global and domestic developments.
L o w world market prices partly attributable to subsidies in developed exporting countries and partly to the
appreciation o f the CFAF vis-a-vis the U S dollar have contributed to the crisis in the sector. However, the
more significant cause has been the failure o f domestic reforms, due mainly to malfknctioning o f
mechanisms established by the inter-profession, and the ambiguous role played by the State in the intended
gradual transition to greater liberalization o f the sector.

Reform process. Benin started i t s liberalization process in the early 1990s and by 2000, i t had partially
privatized and liberalized the sector. I t then put in place new institutions to ensure that the sector remains
integrated. The main responsibility for cotton sector oversight was placed with the Association
Znterprofessionelle du Coton (AIC), which brings together all sector participants, including farmers,
ginners, and input suppliers, with cotton seed marketing and reimbursement o f input credit assured by the
Centrale de Stcurisation des Paiements et du Recouvrement (CSPR).

Although the initial results o f the reforms were promising, the organization o f the sector quickly unraveled
as different actors by-passed rules established by the A I C and CSPR; and delays in payments, loan
servicing and delivery o f services, eroded confidence in the sector. As a result, cotton production which
reached 425,000 tons in 2004/05 declined to 190,000 tons in 2005/2006 before recovering to less than
300,000 tons in the two most recent campaigns. The domestic input price and cotton price-setting
mechanisms and the privatization o f SONAPRA (the cotton ginning agency) became sources o f contention.
The government has repeatedly stepped in to establish input and output prices, ignoring the mechanism in
place for agreeing on prices. The privatization o f SONAPRA has been repeatedly postponed.
Bank involvement. An IDA-financed’ Cotton Sector Reform Project (May 2002- Dec 2008) has helped
build the capacity to establish a more competitive sector and recent PRSCs have supported the reform
process. While significant results were achieved under the investment project, notably in consolidating and
strengthening producer organizations, and in defining the key rules o f the game and the roles o f key actors
in the sector, the reform program stalled due to frequent interventions by the government, including in 2007
with the abrogation o f the regulatory framework and cancellation o f the process to convert SONAPRA to a
majority private-owned company.
Current issues and next steps. Government has recently launched a new privatization process. A new
ginning company, SODECO, has been created to take over the ginning activities o f SONAPRA starting
with the 2008-2009 season. T o consolidate sector reforms, Government and members o f the interprofession have just signed a new framework agreement (January 2009) that establishes the rules o f the
game and the role o f the different actors, private and public. I t would be essential that this framework be
upheld. The sector also needs to agree o n a strategy o n input imports and distribution jointly by
Government and private sector actors.

Benin i s one o f the first 19 countries that have graduated from the HIPC Initiative and have received 100
percent cancellation o f their eligible debt under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), effective as o f
July 2006. Total debt r e l i e f from IDA, the IMF and the African Development Bank (ADB) amounted to
approximately U S $ I .Ibillion or 23.2 percent o f 2006 GDP (60 percent o f which was provided by IDA).

Benin’s Key Development Challenges
29.
A narrow economic base, unreliable and expensive infrastructure services, poor basic
services, corruption and weak institutions remain major challenges for Benin’s economy. T o
accelerate growth to levels that will transform Benin into an emerging economy by 2025, and to
improve the quality o f life o f the population, these issues need to be successfully addressed.
Government will need to pursue reforms and investments that promote competitiveness,
30.
diversification and innovation. T o strengthen competitiveness, the Government i s investing in
infrastructure and t a h n g measures to reduce factor costs, by improving road transport, port
services, energy services, and telecommunications. IFC will work with Government to put in place
a program focused o n reforms to improve the business climate and improve Benin’s Doing
Business indicators. The on-going BanWIFC financed Competitiveness and Integrated Growth
Opportunity Project (CIGOP), i s also helping to improve the business environment and promoting
diversification especially for export. With support f r o m the MCA and IFC, Government i s
implementing new strategic investments, reforms, and the restructuring o f the Port o f Cotonou to
significantly enhance i t s productivity and improve Benin’s regional competitiveness. T o diversify
the economy and reduce dependence on cotton and trade with Nigeria, Government has identified
five high growth potential clusters for which it will provide more strategic and innovative support:
i)Transport and services; ii)Cotton and textile; iii)Agribusiness; iv) Tourism and handicrafts; and
v) Public works and new information and communication technologies (NTIC)6.

31.
Improving basic health outcomes. Despite support for the health sector through the
budget support program and a number o f vertical programs (such as malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS),
there i s little support for the health system and to ensure performance o f institutions (i.e. health care
centers) or individuals (i.e. health workers). Weak governance and administration in the health
sector i s the major bottleneck for achieving the health MDGs. With donor support, Government
plans to: (a) raise the technical and organizational quality o f care by improving health education,
governance and payment mechanisms; (b) tackle inefficiency in the public health system and the
poor quality o f services provided in public health facilities; (c) reinforce the capacity o f the
Ministry o f Health (both at central and at local levels) to perform its functions; (d) improve
hygiene, drinkable water and sanitation systems; and (e) ensure adequate financing for the health
system and introduce incentives for performance.
Providing quality and relevant education. K e y challenges in the sector include: (i)stark
32.
disparities in the provision o f education services based o n social status and geographic location;
(ii)
the lack o f decentralization at the municipal level and weak participatory school management;
(iii)
insufficiencies in initial and in-service training and monitoring performance o f teaching stafe
(iv) lack o f resources to meet the growing demand for higher education; and (v) the mismatch
between what i s taught in the education and professional training system and the skills needed in
the economy. In addressing these issues, the Government will also improve female education and
gender equality in education. The on-going EFA Fast-Track Initiative Partnership i s addressing
some o f these issues t o help Benin achieve the MDG o f Education for All, by improving quality o f
primary education, retention rates, especially for girls, and strengthening the institutional
environment o f the education sector.
Improving access to safe drinking water. Access to potable water in rural areas has
33.
increased from 35 percent in 2002 to 42 percent in 2006 and i s expected to reach 67 percent o f the
The C E M identified a large set o f nontraditional export possibilities across agro- and natural resourcebased products that can serve as a starting point for diversification for Benin. A number o f these products are

population in rural areas by 2015. T o sustain this trend, Government will need to continue: (i)to
improve the performance o f budget execution; (ii)to strengthen the Sector Wide Approach
(SWAP) while developing the administrative and financial deconcentration o f the Water
to empower rural municipalities in investment planning, financing, contracting
Directorate; (iii)
and managing water supply services; and (iv) to put in place an adequate national framework for
Integrated Water Resource Management.
34.

Improving governance and strengthening institutional capacities. Despite progress made

in promoting governance, important challenges remain in tackling corruption and strengthening the
quality o f governance to promote economic development. A diagnostic survey on governance and
corruption in Benin carried out over 2005-2007 confirms governance issues are perceived as a
major challenge. The households surveyed deplored the quality o f essential public services (water,

health, and electricity) and the problem o f bribes needed to obtain public services. Corruption was
reported to be most frequent in the taxation, customs and police services. In addition, there i s a lack
o f trust in key accountability institutions including the parliament and judiciary. Similar
observations were made by the private sector which identified problems with performance o f
public services, fiscal requirements and bribes for registration. Many aspects o f budget and
personnel management in public institutions remain problematic and making the budget an
effective tool for poverty reduction i s a major challenge. The relatively recent move toward
program budgeting and a result-based approach have the potential to improve transparency and the
impact o f public spending. W h i l e the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment conducted in April 2007 confirmed that the Government has made some progress in
Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms since the last C F A A undertaken in 2005, further
improvements are needed.

111. DONOR SUPPORT TO BENIN
PARTNER COORDINATION AND HARMONIZATION

35.
A large number o f development partners are present in Benin (Appendix 3) and this poses
a challenge for coordinating donor support and aligning aid with country priorities. The challenge
will be even greater as China, the MCC’ and the Islamic Banks become development partners in
Benin. Although the PRSP process and budget support programs have fostered collaboration and
coordination between the Government and development partners, this needs to be greatly improved
in cross-cutting areas, such as promoting gender equality, c i v i l service reform, decentralization and
governance.
The Government and development partners are committed to harmonization and
36.
alignment (Appendix 4). Joint Government-donor reviews are regularly carried out in the core
sectors o f rural water, health, and education. T h i s promising experience i s being expanded to other
sectors, such as agriculture, decentralization and transport. Moreover, donor coordination has
improved with joint budget support, leading to a better aid alignment with the SCRP. Since 2004,
joint missions o f the main donors that are providing budget support for PRSP implementation take
place each year in September and the development partners meet regularly every month at the
agency head level and also in 12 sectoral or thematic working groups, several o f which are chaired

-11-

by a government ministry. Finally, joint analytical work i s becoming more common, in particular
in the area o f public finance', and a joint performance assessment framework i s being developed.
37.
Cooperation with the IMF. Bank and Fund teams have closely coordinated the contents o f
their respective programs as well as the determination o f their respective triggers, with the PRSC
covering the structural and social benchmarks, while the PRGF covers macroeconomic issues. In
that context, the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement approved
in August 2005 has addressed issues o f fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to maintain
macroeconomic stability and foster growth. The first three annual PRGF reviews were completed
in November 2006, June 2007 and January 2008, respectively. IMF and IDA staffs will continue to
conduct joint PRSP missions and prepare joint assessments on the PRSP Progress Reports.
38.
This CAS has been prepared in close coordination with the Government and other major
partners. The CAS preparation was launched in September 2007 during a Government-Bank
retreatg, with the participation o f 7 ministers, notably the Minister o f State in charge o f
Development. Discussions have also been organized with other development partners, civil society
and the private sector to review the strategic choices for the Bank. A client survey, supported by a
strategic positioning exercise, has been used to help the country team better understand what
sectors and instruments to focus on and where the Bank has added value.

the 2005 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was conducted jointly by Denmark, the
Netherlands, the European Commission and the Bank. There i s joint work currently on Country Status
Reports (CSR) for Health and Education. There are discussions on joint AAA work in Agriculture in FY09.
9 During the retreat, the priority areas that the Government stated it would l i k e the Bank to concentrate on in
preparing i t s assistance strategy were the following: diversification o f the economy; capacity strengthening in
the public sector; development o f human capital with emphasis on education and health; infrastructure and
private sector development; and promotion o f good governance.
10 Delays in effectiveness average 6-8 months after Board approval and occur mostly at the level o f credit
ratification at the National Assembly but also sometimes from delays in recruiting key project staff.

averaged 30.3 percent for the period 2004-2006, above the average o f 25 percent for the Africa
Region. This reflects in large part the quick disbursing PRSC operations starting in FY04. Overall,
the mediocre portfolio performance reflects the weakness in implementation capacity in the Benin
administration and the need for stronger monitoring and evaluation systems, issues which are being
addressed through a close portfolio monitoring program within the Country Office. These efforts
will continue under the new CAS.

Conclusions drawn from the FYO4-FY06 CAS
41.
The C A S Completion Report (CASCR) concluded that C A S implementation and Bank
performance were broadly satisfactory (Appendix 5). In particular, the CASCR highlighted that
while about 75 percent o f outcomes were achieved, growth performance was weak and there was
little progress in poverty reduction. Outcomes include the maintenance o f macroeconomic stability;
the strengthening o f public expenditure management; improvements in access to safe water and
electricity for the rural population and in access to education; and containment o f HIV/AIDS
prevalence. These results correspond to the areas where the Government showed more ownership
and commitment. However, C A S achievements fell short o f what was envisaged with respect to
expanding the private sector, structural reforms, strengthening institutional capacities and
effectiveness o f the M&E framework for the PRSP.
The CASCR also pointed out the following lessons:
The progressive transition to programmatic lending benefitted from preparatory work on
budget and expenditure management. For example, implementation o f the PRSC-supported
program greatly benefited from the results-based budgeting and public expenditure
management reforms established under the IDA-financed Public Expenditure Reform and
Adjustment Credit.
Much remain to be done to improve the availability and quality of data needed to monitor the
results. As discussed in the JSAN o f the SCRP, reliable data for a number o f results indicators
i s not available. Under the current CAS, the Bank should support efforts to strengthen M&E
capacities, including data management, and establish a results-based M&E framework for the

s o .

The CAS period was characterized by improved policy dialogue between the Bank and the
Government and strengthened coordination with other development partners. However,
implementation o f the program was hampered by capacity constraints, particularly in line
ministries and partners need to continue to support the Government efforts to strengthen i t s
capacity to deliver public services. Bank support was most effective when Government showed
ownership and commitment, such as in public financial management and macroeconomic
stability, and was least successful when dealing with more politically-sensitive issues, such as
with civil service and structural reforms.
Private sector development and economic diversification will help sustain growth
performance in Benin. The economy’s dependence o n a single cash crop and trade with
Nigeria calls for a redoubling of efforts to promote more broad-based growth through
agricultural diversification and improved competitiveness and diversification o f the secondary
and tertiary sectors. Accelerating economic growth will also require improving the overall
quality of the investment climate by strengthening the institutional policy and regulatory
frameworks, the adequacy and quality o f infrastructure as well as an effective judicial system
and a well-functioning financial system.

Lessons Learned and Messages from 2007 Client Survey

42.

The survey was useful in conveying Beninese perceptions of the Bank and of its
contribution to Benin’s development outcomes as well as what they consider as the country’s top
development priorities (Graph 1). The views expressed on Benin’s top development priorities
suggest that the Bank has an important role to play in supporting health services, the fight against
corruption in projects, agriculture, poverty reduction, education, employment, private sector
development, growth and good governance.

The results from the Client Survey were discussed with the Government during a CAS retreat on
September 15,2007 and have been used to inform this Country Assistance Strategy.

43.
Based on feedback received, the following lessons can be drawn from the Client Survey:
(i)
the Bank needs to better demonstrate its effectiveness on the ground, explaining why i t may not
be as flexible as stakeholders would like, and why i t s strategies are in fact realistic, sustainable and
in line with the priorities o f the country; (ii)
finding the right balance between the need to stay
focused on key priorities and greater demand for Bank involvement i s a challenge; (iii)
there i s a
need to demonstrate more effectively the value o f the Bank’s policy and economic advice through
systematic dissemination o f analytical work and improved policy dialogue; (iv) dialogue with other
key stakeholders in Benin, in particular with civil society and private sector needs to be
strengthened; and (v) the Bank needs to improve i t s communication about i t s role, including with
respect to poverty reduction.

CAS STRATEGIC CHOICES AND GUIDINGPRINCIPLES

Strategic Choices

44.
The objective of the Bank’s assistance to Benin is to selectively support implementation
of the SCRP (PRSP-Io. The Bank will focus o n activities that (i)
induce broad-based growth;
(ii)
improve access to basic services and ensure greater efficiency o f public expenditures; and
(iii)
promote better governance. The Bank will leverage other donor financing (health, energy,
agriculture) and additional private sector investments (energy, telecommunications) to complement
i t s support, particularly in sectors where it i s not directly present. The Bank will also pursue
stronger partnerships with IFC and MIGA; and use i t s analytical services to broaden and inform the
reform program and development dialogue.
Preliminary results from the Client Survey and consultations on IDA’S comparative
45.
advantage highlight priority areas for Bank support. These include: (i)growth acceleration
programs including private sector support and diversification programs and basic infrastructure
development; (ii)spatial development, including rural, urban and community management
social sector support; and (iv) governance. T o promote regional integration and
programs; (iii)
collaboration, the Bank will also promote programs that are regional in nature and develop regional
infrastructure and trade. In all these areas, the Bank will continue to play an important catalytic role
to gamer support for SCRP programs.
Guiding Principles

46.
Promote donor harmonization and coordination: Since the 2003 CAS, and particularly in
the context o f the PRSP, there has been increased collaboration and better partnerships between the
Bank and other development partners. The Bank will continue taking the lead in coordinating
donors’ programmatic lending activities through the PRSC while encouraging the use o f sector
wide approaches. Under the leadership o f the Government, the Bank will work with key donors to
deepen harmonization and alignment for increased aid effectiveness and better development results
(Box 2).
Be selective and focus on results. Bank assistance will be aligned with a subset o f the
47.
SCRP pillars and provide support t o a selected group o f activities aimed at achieving the C A S
objectives o f accelerating private sector-led growth and improving access to basic services, as
described under Appendix 2: Selectivity o f the Bank’s program. The Results Matrix (Appendix 1)
provides a comprehensive overview o f h o w the C A S results and indicators are aligned with the
SCRP objectives.
Ensure adequate dissemination of analytical work: Although the 2007 QAG assessment
48.
o f the AAA program under the previous C A S rated the quality o f the program satisfactory, it
concluded that the impact o f the Bank’s AAA program on policy dialogue and capacity building
was limited by the lack o f sufficient dissemination o f the results o f the analytical work. Based o n
these conclusions, this CAS will ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to the dissemination o f
the results o f E S W and that the AAA program i s more effectively utilized to influence policy
reform design and enhance capacity. The Bank will encourage joint analytic work with other
donors as called for in the Paris Declaration.
Promote partnerships within the Bank Group to enhance synergies with IFC and M I C A .
49.
These will be developed with IFC notably in the area o f infrastructure (power, the port, and
telecommunications). Joint projects with IFC will be prepared to help improve the business
environment, and a close collaboration i s also envisaged between the Bank and IFC to support the
development o f the financial sector and the SMEs. MIGA’s portfolio in Benin consists o f t w o

- 15 -

projects: an ongoing investment in telecommunications aimed at improving the country’s
teledensity, and an equity investment which the Agency underwrote in FY09 toward the acquisition
and reconstruction o f a hotel in Cotonou.

BANKGROUP
PROGRAM AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

C A S Strategic Objective 1: Strengthening Competitiveness and Accelerating Private Sectorled Growth

50.
Support stable macroeconomic framework and improve public financial management
(CAS Outcome 1.1). T o achieve this outcome, the Bank will help strengthen the implementation
capacity o f the administration to increase budget execution rates and ensure that the budget process
i s well aligned with the SCRP objectives and that Government continues prudent macro-economic
management. IDA will support this agenda through the PRSC series, updates o f P E F N C F A A and
through i t s dialogue with the authorities. Together with the budget support donor group and other
development partners, the Bank will regularly review SCRP implementation and with the IMF
undertake periodic reviews o f progress under the PRGF.

5 1.
Improve the investment climate and revitalize the private sector (CAS Outcome 1.2).
Private sector development continues to be hampered by Benin’s investment climate,
administrative and regulatory constraints and poor infrastructure. IDA, in strong partnership with
IFC, will work to help Government improve the investment climate and attract private sector
investments in key sectors. During the CAS period, the focus will remain on improving
transparency in administrative processes and providing the needed infrastructure for private sector
development. The ongoing I D N I F C Competitiveness and Integrated Growth Opportunity project
(CIGOP) and an IFC TA (FY09) will help to (i)improve business registration and licensing
provide comprehensive tax reform; and (iii)
consolidate the institutions created to
processes; (ii)
support the private sector. The CIGOP project and the PRSC series will complement activities
under the US-financed MCA”.
Enhance the contribution of agriculture to growth (CAS Outcome 1.3). This includes
52.
emergency measures to enhance domestic food crop production in the short-term to respond to the
food price increases and design o f a medium to longer-term strategy to improve competitiveness
and diversification in the sector.
Response to Food Price increases. From 2006 to 2007, the production o f Benin’s main
cereal staples, rice and maize, decreased by about 9 percent and 14 percent respectively.
Since November 2007, the Government has taken measures to limit the impact o f
increasing prices o f food crops on the consumer. In early 2008, the Government launched
an Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP) aimed at enhancing domestic food
production in the short- and medium- terms. In response, the Bank approved in October
2008 an Emergency Food Security Support Project for $9 million which i s being
undertaken under the Global Food Crisis Response Program and financed under the Food
Price Crisis Response Trust Fund. The grant, which became effective November 5, 2008,
will support over a two year period Government’s efforts by subsidizing and strengthening
emergency operations for the provision o f fertilizers to about 50,000 producers o f rice and
maize, to boost food production in the short run. The grant will help lay the groundwork

11

The reforms supported by MCA include: land market reform, involving land registration, titling and
transfers; judiciary reform to improve the transparency and accountability o f court decisions; overhaul o f
customs systems including making the one stop shop at the port operational and completing the
computerization o f transactions as well as investments to improve port capacity.

- 16-

for future Bank agriculture operations envisioned in 2009, which should include activities
aimed at promoting food crops commodity chains.
Strategy to Promote Competitiveness and DiversiJication. Benin’s agriculture exports
have been sluggish because o f l o w productivity, constraints in input procurement, and lack
o f competitiveness in the sector. Measures to alleviate these constraints to improve
productivity, input distribution, and establish effective supply chains, quality control and
sanitary norms, will be essential to successfully diversify the sector. An agriculture
diversification study (FY09) will analyze these issues to see how best to promote private
sector development and publidprivate partnerships in agriculture. The study will provide
input for a subsequent agricultural diversification operation that could support reforms in
the cotton sector, the value chain (from production to transformatiodexportation) o f other
promising agro-products, improve productivity o f food crops and help address gender
issues in the sector. The on-going CIGOP operation will also install a minimum integrated
trade expansion platform (MITEP) that will help entrepreneurs identify and transform
products to fit market development opportunities.
Promote growth inducing infrastructure -Telecommunications (CAS Outcome 1.4).
53.
This sector represents a key growth area for Benin and the Bank will provide support to establish
the regulatory and institutional framework for fair access to Benin’s telecom network, prevent
unlicensed operators from entering the sector and ensure a level playing field between all operators
(including mobile operators). Other recommendations from the ICT study completed in FY08 will
be followed up through an I C T project (FY10) and the PRSC series. The Bank’s support w i l l also
include the implementation o f a modernized framework law governing electronic communication,
including PPPs in the sector. The ongoing CIGOP i s currently helping with the privatization o f
Benin Telecom (opening it up to the private sector).
Promote growth inducing infrastructure - Energy services (CAS Outcome 1,5), Benin
54.
has faced severe energy crises over the last two to three years as a result o f the lack o f effective
energy sector planning and financial crises facing the energy sector companies, namely the local
electricity distribution company, the Sociktk Bdninoise d ’Energie Electrique (SBEE), and also the
bi-national Compagnie Electrique du Bdnin, CEB. The high cost o f establishing adequate national
generation capacity has also been a major cause o f the energy deficit and problems. Through the
PRSC series and an ongoing Energy Sector project (PFSE), the Bank i s helping Government put in
place a program to reduce the operating costs o f SBEE and improve i t s efficiency, and define an
appropriate sector strategy, including defining the role o f private operators. A new energy sector
operation (FY09) and a regional energy operation (FY12) will help increase access to electricity
and improve the operational efficiency o f the generation, transmission and distribution system.

55.
Increase competitiveness through greater regional integration and reduced trade costs
(CAS Outcome 1.6). Through the regional Abidjan-Lagos transport and transit facilitation project
(FYlO), the Bank will help to address transport and facilitation bottlenecks identified along the
corridor. Benin’s participation in the project i s crucial to reduce the bottlenecks to trade and
transport and increase the country’s competitiveness. The West and Central Africa Air Transport
Safety and Security Program (FY09) will strengthen the C i v i l Aviation Authority’s oversight
capacity in both safety and security and make improvements to Cotonou airport’s security. W h i l e
the M C A has taken the lead in helping the government improve port efficiency, the Bank Group
will j o i n M C A to design an implementation strategy for an action plan designed in June 2007. I F C
i s providing advisory services to promote sound PPPs for the port. The Abidjan-Lagos Corridor
Project may include a component for establishing a one-stop window at the port.

- 17-

C A S Strategic Objective 2: Improving Access to Basic Services
56.
Improve environmental and urban sanitation improvements (CAS Outcome 2.1). Very
poor sanitary conditions in some neighborhoods o f Benin’s main cities (Cotonou, Porto-Novo and
Parakou) have for years endangered the health o f residents and restricted their access to social
services and economic activity. Since the Bank’s initial investments in the 1990s to improve these
conditions by upgrading infrastructure, other donors, such as France, the EU, BOAD have provided
additional investments which have helped strengthen the technical and financial capacity o f
municipalities to increase resources needed to maintain equipment and infrastructure. The most
recent Bank support was an additional financing o f $40 million (FY08) to support and strengthen
the Second Decentralized Urban Management Project (PGUD-2). Support during the CAS period
will be re-oriented toward improving urban environmental management, including solid waste
management, increasing access t o urban sanitation and drainage services, and strengthening
capacities t o manage the environment. A proposed IDA UrbadEnvironment project (FY 11) would
leverage other investments in the urban environment domain in addition t o the drainage
infrastructure that i s currently funded by the donors. T w o ongoing GEF Projects (FY06 and FY08)
are helping Benin to promote conservation and sustainable use o f coastal wetlands and marine
resources, as well as integrated management o f forests and adjacent lands.
Improve access to safe and sustainable drinking water and sanitation service (CAS
57.
Outcome 2.2). The Bank, through the PRSC, and in close collaboration with donor partners, will
continue t o strengthen the successful sector-wide approach implemented in the Rural Water Supply
and Sanitation (RWSS) program. M o r e specifically, the Bank will support the implementation o f
critical reforms aiming at : (i)accelerating the whole cycle o f services delivery to increase
enhancing efficiency and transparency in the
sustainable and equitable access to water supply; (ii)
achieving the transfer o f responsibility from the central administration t o
sector expenditures; (iii)
the local governments, including investment planning, financing, contracting and managing water
supply services; and (iv) improving the sustainability o f water services through a greater
participation o f local government, private operators and water consumer associations.
Improve quality education services to better respond to development needs (CAS
58.
Outcome 2.3). The Bank will continue to support the Government in i t s efforts to reach the
education MDGs, in particular gender equality through the PRSC series and the Education For All
Fast-Track Initiative Catalytic Fund (effective December 2008). As part o f the AAA effort to
support education, the Bank has prepared an Education Country Status Report, whose analysis will
help the Government to refine i t s priorities for sector development and this will be followed up
through the PRSC. The Bank would also play a catalytic role in tertiary education reform through
a TA assessment o f the sub-sector, which would be undertaken in complement to the CSR.
Meanwhile, the Bank would undertake additional sector work (FY10) o n s h l l needs for the key
sectors o f the economy and h o w vocational, technical and tertiary education should respond t o
these.

59.
Increase access to health and nutrition services and treatment for HIV/MDS and
Malaria (CAS Outcome 2.4). Health outcomes have been stagnating due t o weak sector
governance, while poor nutrition, H I V / A I D S and malaria remain serious concerns. The Bank i s
currently preparing a Country Status Report for the Health sector (FY09) which has already
demonstrated the need to find a new financing approach in the sector at least until the governance
and institutional set-up are improved. The CSR will provide the government o f Benin, the W o r l d
Bank and other donors and partners in health with the knowledge base to better define the nature
and scope o f future support. This would be based o n two different mechanisms: one on the supply
side (performance contracts) and the other on the demand side (mandatory health insurance
schemes). Major improvements (in terms o f building capacity in the Health Services with regards
to the analysis o f health policies, enhancing the Ministry’s ability to assess, design and monitor

- 18-

policies) can be achieved in the sector through the development o f a health SWAP (FY10). The
SWAP will emphasize the implementation o f result-based financing (RBF) mechanisms, which
offer a promising solution for achieving several MDGs in a fast and sustainable way. Bank
financing for the health sector, though modest, i s supplemented by Trust Funds (Global Alliance
for Vaccination and Immunization and Health Results Based Financing) and will leverage
additional donor resources to support implementation o f the National Strategic Health Plan.
Ongoing projects to support control and fight against H I V / A I D S and malaria will continue and a
new TA project will support nutrition programs.

CAS Strategic Objective 3: Promoting better governance and strengthening
institutional capacities
60.
Improve public administration, transparency and anti-corruption (CAS Outcome 3.1).
Corruption and institutional dysfunction waste scarce public resources and constitute a challenge to
good governance. The PRSC series will continue to support implementation o f the Government’s
policy framework for Results-OrientedBudget Management (GBAR) adopted in December 200512
and will be used to strengthen internal capacity, with support from the budget support donor
partners. The CAS would also support implementation o f the Government’s PFM action plan
prepared by the authorities to address the weaknesses and key challenges identified by the 2007
PEFA diagnostic (see paragraph 34). During the CAS period, the Bank and partners will work to
ensure that short and medium term measures are well sequenced and prioritized. Key donors
including the EU, the Netherlands and DANIDA are planning to set-up a fund to support
implementation o f the action plan. The Governance and Anti-Corruption Diagnostic Survey,
finished in June 2007 with technical support from the World Bank Institute and financial support
from the AfDB and the World Bank, will provide the analytical underpinnings for the policy and
institutional reforms on governance and for updating the Strategic Anti-Corruption Plan. Through
TA and the PRSC, the Bank Group would provide support to the Government’s anti-corruption and
institutional reform agenda which i s focused on actions that will reduce corruption in key public
sector institutions and will place a strong accent on strengthening the demand side o f governance.
With regard to Benin’s judicial and legal systems, the Government i s implementing a ten year
reform program which was prepared in 2001 with Bank’s support. This i s being supported by
programs financed by the EU and the MCA13 to improve capacity o f the justice system and permit
acceleration o f judicial reforms.
Strengthen budget accounting, implementation and control (CAS Outcome 3.2). W h i l e
61.
the ambitious public finance reform started in 2006 has increased accountability in sector ministries
and transparency in accounting and financial information, there are still weaknesses in the
production o f financial reports, the monitoring o f resources, and in accounting. The PRSC series
will support Government’s plan to further strengthen budget accounting and accelerate production
o f financial reports and internal control mechanisms currently under implementation. A ROSC
AAA work (FY09) i s ongoing and will help develop and implement a country action plan to
improve institutional capacity and the country’s corporate financial reporting regime in the
accounting and auditing profession. An IDF Grant for strengthening capacity o f the accountancy
The GBAR strategy was based on the 2005 C F A A update and the PEFA assessments.
M C A Access to Justice Project (US$34.27 million) has as its objective improving ability o f the justice
system to enforce contracts and reconcile claims. The project includes: strengthening o f the Arbitration,
Mediation and Conciliation Centre (CAMeC) and the Business Registration Centre (CFE); strengthening and
improvement o f the judicial system (training and support to the Inspector General), construction o f the court
o f appeals in Abomey, o f eight (8) courts o f f i r s t instance and o f a Legal and Judicial Information Centre, and
the establishment o f a support fund for the access o f the poor and the unprivileged to judicial services. The
EU program o f 12 million Euros, finances some construction for the Appeals Court, helps with internal
reorganization o f the various jurisdictions and training o f magistrates and judges, and computerization o f
some o f the courts.
l3The

- 19-

profession (FY08) will help increase in the medium-term the number o f qualified accountants in
Benin. The Bank will work with AfDB and the Netherlands to accompany Government efforts to
increase the effectiveness o f internal and external audit institutions. The CAS will also support the
implementation o f the new procurement code and restructuring o f the institutional set-up for
procurement in conformity with the new WAEMU Regional Directives on legal and institutional
frameworks, as well as the preparation and implementation o f a national strategy on capacity
building in public procurement.
Support decentralization through community development (CAS Outcome 3.3). Better
62.
implementation o f the decentralization program i s needed to strengthen accountability,
transparency in local decision malung and responsiveness to local concerns. The IDA-financed
C D D project has supported decentralization by providing communes and communities with
technical and financial support; and encouraging Government to increase i t s financial support to
communes and communities. The Bank will seek to leverage support from other donors for the
C D D approach. A follow-up operation in FY11 will seek to use a SWAP approach to support
decentralization and could provide an opportunity to harmonize donor support in this arena. The
SWAP could be designed to help local governments prepare local development plans and link them
to the SCRP. The Bank would undertake sector work on decentralization and local development in
FY12. Support for decentralization i s also being provided to municipalities through the IDAfinanced urban sanitation program.

63.
I n conjunction with the different instruments, the Bank is also launching a program of
outreach and technical assistance for parliamentarians, civil society, and the media on key
development issues. This technical assistance will be used to disseminate information on Bank and
donor activities, address issues o f governance, political economy, and implementation capacity that
are best addressed through dialogue and exchange with the different stakeholders, rather than by
studies or formal training programs.

V. DELIVERING THE BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
A.

LEVERAGING
THE EXISTING

PORTFOLIO

64.
Successful implementation of the existing portfolio will be key to achieve the CAS
outcomes and support the growth strategy. As o f November 30, 2008, the IDA portfolio consists
o f 7 operations totaling US$287.3 million in commitments (Table 5). This excludes budget support
through the PRSCs which has averaged about US$30 million per year14. There are also two GEFFinanced operations totaling $10.3 million. Portfolio performance faced particular challenges over
the first nine months o f FY08 and this led Q A G to activate a Country Record Flag for Benin. W i t h
the closing o f the two main problem projects at the end o f FY08, however, portfolio performance
o f the portfolio has improved (table 4). The IDA portfolio i s supplemented increasingly by trust
funds (Bank and recipient-executed). While TF disbursements in FY07/08 were small relatively to
IDA (less than $1 million, i.e. about 4%), they are expected to increase substantially in FY09 and
beyond. In FY09, TF disbursements are projected to more than double the FY08 level, not
including projected disbursements for Education for All.

14

Exceptionally, the budget support for FY07 (PRSC 3 and PRSC4) totaled $70 million. There was no
budget support operation in FY08 but PRSC 4 was disbursed in April 2008.

The main challenges over the last 18 months have involved management performance,
dijjficult political choices, in addition to the normal areas of delays in effectiveness and
procurement, and quite high disbursement lags. The deterioration o f the portfolio during the f i r s t
nine months o f 2008 involved about three main operations that were rated “at risk”: the Cotton
Sector Reform, the GEF Forests and Private Sector Support projects. Both the Private Sector and
Cotton projects have closed with their Development Objectives (DO) rated unsatisfactory. In the
case o f the Cotton Sector Reform project, this was due to the very slow pace o f action on reform o f
the cotton sector and its transition to a more liberal and competitive system. T h e Private Sector
Support project, on the other hand, had an overly ambitious design that made it impossible to
achieve most o f the objectives. W h i l e the implementation progress o f the GEF financed Forestry
project had been plagued by management problems and delays in procurement and disbursement, it
has began to turn around over the last several months, and implementation progress i s now
satisfactory.
66.
The country team has started over the last 18 months a systematic monitoringprocess of
the portfolio. The reviews help to provide a better understanding o f projects’ performance, to
identify problems as they arise and to address some o f the generic issues. Inparticular, the team has
instituted quarterly mini-CPPR meetings with P I U coordinators and relevant staff from the
Ministries o f Finance and Development to discuss ways to address implementation problems. The
first meetings have focused on procurement and disbursement issues but there still remain
additional efforts to improve procurement management at all levels.
67.
I n addition to DPLs and SWAPS which are already being implemented through the
country PFM system, the Bank is conducting a review of the use of Benin PFM system for
investment operationsfinanced by the B a n k The objectives o f the review are to: (i)
support better
project design and portfolio management on the part o f the Bank; (ii)
provide a solid basis for
increased use o f FM country systems for investment projects in Benin; (iii)
provide inputs for a
comprehensive action plan to assist the Government in strengthening the aspects o f the system
which need improvement before they can be used, and to discuss relevant implementation
including transition measures, if any. The use o f the country P F M system will help scale up
development impact, foster country ownership, facilitate harmonization and simplify and reduce
transaction costs as called for in the Paris Declaration. Therefore, the country P F M system will be
used by default for the delivery o f Bank’s assistance wherever i t i s deemed appropriate. The Bank
will accompany this transition with appropriate level o f technical assistance, especially in the areas
of budgeting, information system, accounting, treasury/fund flows, asset management, internal
audit and external audit.

LENDING
PROGRAM

68.
I t is hoped that Benin can, under the CAS, reestablish its performance to receive at least
the same I D A allocation under IDA15 as it did under I D A 14. The current IDA15 allocation for
Benin shows a reduction o f 7 percent compared to IDA14. The total indicative IDA allocation for
Benin during the CAS period (FY09-FY 12), i s SDR191.3 million, approximately US$3 12 million
(see table 6). This total amount consists o f the IDA15 (FY09-FY11) indicative amount o f
SDR 142.2 million and a projected SDR48.9 million for FY12, the first year o f IDA16. The actual
IDA allocation will be determined annually based on: (i)
country performance as reflected in the
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and portfolio performance; (ii)Benin’s
performance relative to that o f other IDA countries; (iii)
lending terms (mix o f grants and credit);
(iv) the overall IDA resources available; and (v) changes in the l i s t o f IDA-eligible counties.
Better portfolio performance and a more favorable CPIA score over the course o f the CAS period
absolutely and relative to other counties, would help increase the IDA allocation. Thus, the size o f
IDA financing would be influenced significantly by Government policy and institutional reforms as
well as by absorptive capacity as reflected in progress in implementing the country project
portfolio. In addition to the ongoing trust finds (para. 64), the country team will pursue future trust
fund financing to complement the limited IDA resources.
69.
If slippages occur in the structural reform and governance areas that constitute the core
performance indicators under budget support, the lending program, both the PRSC series as well
as some investment projects, would need to be reconsidered. The Bank Group will help
Government improve portfolio quality through its engagement, project supervision and direct
follow-up as issues arise and through portfolio management.

I n light of the limited I D A resources and the need to support growth, the Bank will rely
on a selective combination of budget support (PRSCs) and investment operations. Past Bank
experience has shown that a combination o f budget support coupled by key investments and project
assistance are needed to have a coherent approach to supporting structural reforms. Profiting from

- 22 -

the lessons learned under the first four PRSC series in Benin, the policy dialo gue under the
PRSCs series during this C A S period will focus o n macroeconomic and public finance
management, education and other social issues to bolster efforts o f sector investment operations.
The PRSC has proven an effective instrument for supporting the Bank’s dialogue with Government
and development partners o n growth and poverty reduction issues.

7 1.
The self-standing investment operations together with regional programs will help
reinforce the impact of the structural reforms in the key sectors. The main investment and
regional operations t o be financed by IDA would be in the key areas o f growth-inducing
infrastructure (energy, telecommunications, and regional roads), social and community
infrastructure (urban sanitation and environmental improvement, and community development),
agriculture reform (cotton, diversification) and support for food-crop production, and human
development (heath sector reform and development).’’ IDA will emphasize SWAPS to better
harness donor support around shared reform and investment objectives. The main regional
programs in which Benin i s expected to participate are the West and Central A f i i c a Air Transport
Safety and Security (FY09); the Abidjan-Lagos Transport and Transit Facilitation Project (FY lo),
and the Adjarala-Hydro-electric program (FY12).

ANALYTICALAND ADVISORY PROGRAM

72.
Building on the recent QAG assessment of the AAA program under the previous CAS,
the planned knowledge program will be guided by the following principles ; (i)
AAA studies
should clearly indicate the strategic priorities and define the accountabilities o f the institutions;
(ii)
use local consultants whenever possible; (iii)
use better monitoring arrangements and results
indicators; and (iv) improve the dissemination and outreach strategy and the
engagement/consultation process with the clients. The Bank will ensure that sufficient resources
are devoted to the dissemination o f programmed E S W and that key stakeholders are engaged
during all phases.

RESULT-BASED
MONITORING
AND EVALUATION

73.
I n the spirit of the Paris Declaration and taking into account that the CAS is fully
aligned with the SCRPpillars and goals, monitoring and evaluation of the CAS will be done in
coordination with the SCRP. Most o f the core outcomes and indicators (Results Matrix, Appendix
1) selected to assess progress in implementing the assistance program are derived from the SCRP
and indicators from the Bank-financed portfolio and these reflect the selective areas o f Bank
involvement. Also, overall reviews o f progress o n meeting the CAS outcomes will take place
annually and will be closely aligned with the annual joint review o f the SCRP implementation.
These will be complemented by the portfolio reviews especially where there i s lack o f necessary
information or when the SCRP does not specify clear and specific benchmarks and targets. The
IDA-financed investment operations all have as objectives, strengthening existing monitoring and
evaluation mechanisms and monitoring o f the CAS through the M&E system for the SCRP will be
complemented by quarterly reviews o f the performance o f Bank’s portfolio (Para 66) as well as by
annual CPPRs. The Bank will prepare a CAS Progress Report in 20 11 to evaluate progress toward
CAS outcomes and adjust strategy and program if needed. The Progress Report will be completed
after Benin’s presidential elections scheduled for 201 1 to allow consideration o f new government
policy. A CAS Completion Report will be prepared at the end o f the CAS period.
The revised participatory M&E system developed for the SCRP, which builds on the
74.
assessment of the M&E mechanismfor thefirst PRSP, establishes a simplified system that would
guarantee better coordination of actions and synergy between the stakeholders involved in the
monitoring and evaluation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy. The new institutional framework
also gives greater responsibility to the sector ministries and the central statistical production units
and strengthens the synchronization between the technical and administrative monitoring.
Moreover, during the revision o f the PRSP, the Government broadened the set o f monitoring
indicators (of which many are derived from the sectoral performance indicators and targets set out
in sector program budgets) and prepared a detailed Priority Action Plan (PAP) which establishes a
sound monitoring and evaluation framework for assessing progress under the strategy and offers a
more appropriate institutional framework for monitoring the implementation o f this CAS.

As discussed in the JSAN of the SCRP, some weaknesses need to be addressed to achieve
75.
a more efficient system and ensure an effective monitoring of PRSP results. These include the
availability and quality o f data and weak sectoral monitoring and evaluation capacities. Therefore,
the Bank will continue to closely work with other main development partners to support
Government’s efforts to strengthen national statistical capacity and make more effective and
operational the national M&E system that will ensure a regular and adequate assessment o f the
implementation o f the SCRP. In particular, the Bank and key donors will support the preparation
and implementation o f the National Statistics Development Strategy which aims to strengthen the
national statistical system, improve the availability and quality o f data and strengthen the
coordination o f statistical agencies.

VI. MANAGING R I S K S
76.
There are a number o f factors that pose risks for implementing and achieving the objectives
o f this strategy and that need to be mitigated.

77.
Weak commitment or lack of consensus for reforms. W h i l e measures undertaken in the
early months o f the current administration demonstrated Government commitment to structural
reforms, the slowdown in the reform momentum indicates a weaker consensus or capacity to
implement reforms, which may be due to a number o f factors, including personal interests and
political opposition from parliament. In order to move forward with the agenda and to achieve i t s

- 24 -

ambitious growth targets for Benin, Government has restated i t s commitment to the reforms and i s
initiating open debates with key actors to arrive at a consensus for moving forward. This i s crucial
to avoid resistance to the reform agenda and reversals o f policies. The Bank Group i s providing
support to Government in the objective analysis o f reforms to support their growth and poverty
reducing objectives and has initiated a new dialogue with stakeholders, such as parliamentarians to
help restore the momentum for the reform agenda.

78.
Weak absorptive capacity. Over the past few years, as Government has tried to improve
public financial management procedures, it has become apparent that weak absorptive capacity has
contributed to slow budget execution. Sector ministries seem to face a number o f constraints in
budget execution, namely long delays in spending execution, cuts in domestically-financed
investments and high volume o f payment arrears, thus limiting the implementation o f sector
programs, and consequently the progress towards achieving objectives. Measures to improve
procurement capacity and planning in sector ministries through the PRSCs and direct TA provided
by the Country Office are helping. Institutional reforms and capacity building through on-going
projects and proposed SWAps should also help improve absorptive capacity. Finally, the PRSCs
are designed to help improve budget execution, strengthen the dialogue between sector ministries
and the Ministry o f Economy and Finance, and along with the P E F N C F A A help strengthen
capacity for public expenditure management.
79.
External shocks and risks to the macroeconomic framework Given the importance o f the
cotton sector and transit trade with Nigeria to the economy, Benin’s economy remains very
vulnerable to external shocks mainly in the form o f volatile international prices and demand for
cotton and trade restrictions imposed by Nigeria. A global economic slowdown leading to lower
cotton export revenues or reduced trade with Nigeria would pose a serious risk to the
macroeconomic framework. In addition, current external conditions are likely to remain
challenging and pose significant risks to the country’s macroeconomic outlook. A deeper-thanexpected global downturn caused by the financial crisis could dampen export demand and financial
flows (notably FDI and aid). Other possible shocks include terms o f trade volatility, disaster risks
such as droughts and floods that can affect agriculture, and loss o f confidence that could cause
capital outflows. The acceleration o f the reform process in the cotton sector and the medium t e r m
prospects for diversification, as well as ongoing efforts to improve trade relations with Nigeria,
should help mitigate this risk. Also, these risks are mitigated through the m i x o f instruments
included in the CAS and supported by Benin’s partners (PRSCs, investment operations and
SWAps) and the specific measures included in the planned operations to (i)
open the market to new
producers in agriculture to diversify production and improve investments, production and
strengthen the regulatory framework and policy environment to
marketing for cotton; and (ii)
support economic diversification and private sector-led growth.

Appendix 3: Benin’s External Partners
Multilateral
The European Commission i s a major source of funds for Benin’s investment budget with a
focus on infrastructure, governance and local development. The lo* European Development
Fund will cover 2009-2013 with an estimated amount o f 334 million Euros. Infrastructure will
remain a strong sector o f concentration where one third o f financing will go to sectoral budget
support. Governance and local development are the other priority sectors. EC’s Strategy will also
target competitiveness, social cohesion, environment and support to civil society.
The African Development Bank. The PRSSP I1 o f the African Development Bank (AfDB) i s
part o f the budget support program that, together with the Bank’s PRSC and budget support from
other donors, supports the implementation o f the PRSP with a strong focus o n public expenditure
management reform, public procurement reform, internal and external controls, and capacity
building. Since the signature o f the Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) between the Bank and
AfDB in 2002, coordination between the two institutions has greatly improved. In particular, the
PRSSP I1was coordinated with PRSCs prior actions’6. The Bank also collaborates very strongly
with AfDB on regional operations on road transport, trade facilitation, and energy. The AfDB
has also been supporting Benin in agriculture (livestock, forestry) and higher education (through a
regional WAEMU project).
The United Nations has recently completed its W A F for 2009-2013 with an estimated
US$126.64 million mobilized. I t would focus on poverty reduction and programs that would help
achieve the MDGs, through rural development, employment promotion, equitable access to basic
social services including health, education, gender, promotion o f good governance and
participative development.
Bilateral
France’s support i s provided by the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs (Cultural and Cooperation
Department o f the French embassy) and by the French Development Agency (AFD). AFD i s
financing part o f the budget support. Projects focus on energy, water and sanitation
infrastructures, vocational training, farmer organizations, and sustainable regional and local
development .
The Dutch cooperation will focus more and more on the water and sanitation sector. They
also take part in budget support. Other areas o f support are education, promotion o f good
governance and agriculture.
Denmark focuses assistance on education and institutionalreforms. Projects in these sectors
come in complement to the aid delivered through budget support. Projects also target the financial
sector, agriculture, water and sanitation supply, vocational training and gender inequalities.
German assistance focuses on decentralization and rural infrastructure. Technical
cooperation i s provided through GTZ, while KfW offers financial cooperation. KfW i s involved
in budget support and recently opened a local office. At present, Germany’s assistance includes

16

One good example o f the application o f the M o U i s the public procurement reform where the
AfDB and IDA teams have enhanced the coordination o f their technical advice, leading to the
selection o f joint sets o f conditionalities and prior actions.

- 39 -

projects in sustainable natural resource management, drinking water and decentralization. They
are also interested in supporting the energy sector.

U S AID i s provided through USAID and the MCA. U S A I D assistance focuses on education
and health. In particular, U S A I D i s implementing the US$45 million President’s Malaria
Initiative over three to four years. This complements the U S 3 1 m i l l i o n Bank-financed malaria
booster program. Benin i s also one o f the countries selected for the Millennium Challenge
Account (MCA). The M C A assistance o f US$307.3 million focuses on: (a) access to land;
(b) access to financial services; (c) access to justice; and (d) access to markets. The access to
land project (US$36.02 million) i s designed t o ensure secure access t o land through an efficient
land administration in order to facilitate investment and the creation o f a land market using land
property as collateral. The access to financial services project (US19.65 million) has as i t s
objective the expansion o f low-cost financial services to micro, small and medium enterprises
(MSME). The access to justice project (US$34.27 million) supports the capacity o f the justice
system to enforce contracts and reconcile claims. The access to markets project (US$) 169.45
million) focuses o n improvements to the Port o f Cotonou. Government has signed a contract with
I F C Advisory Services to work alongside M C A in the investments at the port. Most o f the M C A financed activities have n o w started.
Multiple other donors are involved. Additional donors include the Belgian and Swiss
cooperation, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), China, the Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the West African Development Bank (BOAD) and the
Islamic Banks (Islamic Development Bank,, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa,
etc).

Appendix 4: Implementing the Paris Declaration: the Bank’s efforts in Benin

Since the adoption o f the Paris Declaration in March 2005, the Bank has been working with other
key development partners to align support with Benin’s priorities and policies (as laid out in the
PRSP) and harmonize donor procedures to reduce transaction costs and achieve greater results.
Preliminary results from the 2008 Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration show that the Bank
has made substantial progress toward meeting the Paris Declaration targets but more efforts are
needed to deepen these achievements. The Bank i s on track to meeting the Paris targets for use o f
public financial management (PFM) systems and parallel project implementation unit (PIU) and
has made significant progress on increasing lending through Program-based approaches (PBAs)
as well as conducting joint analytic work. However, greater efforts will be needed in other
important areas such as coordination o f technical cooperation and joint missions.
Program-based approaches. Since 2004, PBAs are being increasingly used by the Bank in Benin
through PRSCs and sectorwide approaches. The share o f P B A disbursements in total IDA
disbursements in Benin increased from 21 percent in 2004 to 48 percent in 2007 (compared with
an average o f 30 percent for the Africa countries which participated in the 2008 Survey).
Use of national jinancial systems. Significant progress in strengthening public finance
management has allowed increased use o f national P F M systems by development partners. Bank
input into the 2008 Survey indicates that 48 percent o f Bank disbursements in 2007 used national
P F M systems against 34 percent for the African countries group that responded to the survey,
while 85 percent o f Bank operations used national procurement systems (the second highest
percentage among the African participant countries).
Reliance on parallel PIUs. The Bank has made real progress in integrating project management
into existing national structures. Available data suggest that more than 70 percent o f Bankfinanced projects were integrated into national structures in 2007 compared with 30 percent in
2005. Furthermore, the transition to budget support and SWAP-like approaches will progressively
lead to a significant reduction in PIUs.
Coordinated Technical Assistance. Coordinating technical assistance with other donors i s one o f
the major areas where the Bank will need to focus to ensure that the target o f providing 50
percent o f capacity-development support through coordinated programs i s met. Under the
definition used by the Survey, n o coordinated Bank TA was reported for 2007, due in part to the
absence o f a clear national capacity development strategy on which to align Bank capacitydevelopment support.
Joint analytic work. The Bank has taken some important initiatives to build analytical partnership
with other development assistance agencies and the Government over the last years. Joint
analytical work i s becoming more common, in particular in the area o f public finance. The Bank
and Denmark collaborated in a Public Expenditure Review (PER) in 2004, while the 2005
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was conducted jointly by Denmark, the
Netherlands, the European Commission and the Bank. The 2007 PEFA assessment was closely
coordinated between the Bank and the other key donors. There i s also joint work currently
underway on Country Status Reports (CSR) for Health and Education, and additional joint sector
work planned for Agriculture in FY09.

The country financing parameters for Benin set out below have been approved by the Regional
Vice-president, Afnca, and are being posted on the Bank’s internal website.

Item
Cost Sharing. Limit on the
proportion o f individual project

finance.

Parameter
up to 100%

Recurrent cost financing. Any
limits that would apply to the
overall amount o f recurrent
expenditures o f a given project
that the Bank may finance.

N o countrylimit level

Local cost financing. A r e the
requirements for Bank
financing o f local expenditures
met, namely that: (i)
financing
requirements for the country’s
development program would
exceed the public sector’s own
resources (e.g., from taxation
and other revenues) and
expected domestic borrowing;
and (ii)
the financing o f foreign
expenditures alone would not
enable the Bank to assist in the
financing o f individual projects.
Taxes and duties. A r e there
any taxes and duties that the
Bank would not finance.

Yes

None

Remarks / Explanation
The Bank’s financing share in individual projects would
be determined in a manner which supports government
ownership o f projects, and on that basis counterpart
funding by Government will generally be expected in all
projects. The Bank will continue to promote
harmonization o f i t s program with other donors’
assistance including through seeking cofinancing.
Enhanced flexibility i s expected to be particularly
appropriate in the case o f social sectors and decentralized
or C D D operations, although typically contributions from
Government and community contributions to local
development programs will be sought. Nonetheless, there
may be projects where Bank financing o f up to 100%
would be required, for example in operations supporting
regional HIV/AIDS or Malaria programs and reform
efforts.
The Bank would continue to monitor the overall fiscal and
debt positiodperformance and i t s implications for
recurrent cost financing. The appropriateness and the
level o f recurrent cost financing in each individual project
would be decided on a case-by-case basis, based on
assessment o f sustainability at the project and sector
levels. Recurrent cost financing i s expected to broadly
remain at current levels.
T h e criteria for local cost financing are met. Therefore,
the Bank may finance local expenditures in any
proportions as needed for individual projects.

The current tax and duties system i s considered to be
reasonable. At the project-level, the Bank would consider
whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively high
share o f project cost.

Date o f CAS: July 16,2003

Country: Benin
Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: FY04 - FY06

CAS Completion Report completed by: Nouridine Kane Dia, Economist
Evelyn Anna Kennedy, Operations Analyst
Date: October 2008

Executive Summary

Introduction

1.
This C A S Completion Report assesses the effectiveness o f the Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy for Benin covering the July 2003 - June 2006 period. The overarching
objective o f the C A S was to support the implementation o f the 2003 - 2005 Poverty Reduction
Strategy. I t s main findings will contribute to the preparation o f the new C A S 2009 - 2012.
CAS Objectives

2.
The 2003 C A S had three broad objectives: (i)
consolidate macroeconomic stability and
promote growth; (ii)strengthen human development and environmental management; and
(iii)
improve governance and institutional capacities.
Country Outcomes

3.
Benin has made substantial progress in consolidating macroeconomic stability and in
improving key social indicators. However, economic performance was lower than envisaged
while n o progress has been made in reducing poverty. Macroeconomic management has remained
sound despite unfavorable international environment as evidenced by broadly successful
implementation o f the IMF-supported program under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
arrangements. Inflation was broadly contained under the WAEMU convergence criterion o f 3
percent and the external current account deficit narrowed from 8.1 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 7.1
percent o f GDP in 2006. The overall budget deficit (on a payment order basis and excluding
grants) was limited at 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2006. However, real GDP growth rate decelerated
from 5.2 percent on average over 2000-02 to 3.3 percent over the 2003-2005 period, due to
declining international prices o f cotton and trade restrictions imposed by Nigeria. These
developments, which highlight the vulnerability o f the economy to external shocks, underline the
need to diversify the economy and strengthen i t s competitiveness.
4.
Progress in reducing poverty has been mixed. The incidence o f monetary poverty seems
to have increased from 28.5 percent in 2002 to 37.4 percent in 2006 with a more severe
deterioration in rural areas. Rural poverty rates have sharply increased f r o m 3 1.6 percent in 2002
to 38.8 percent in 2006 while increasing as well from 29 percent to 35 percent in urban areas. The
incidence o f non-monetary poverty in rural areas stood at 58.3 percent in 2006 compared with
18.4 percent in urban areas. Reducing poverty in rural areas will require strengthening agriculture
revenues and identifying new contributors to growth to diversify producers’ incomes.

5.
Progress has been made in improving human development but further efforts would be
needed to reach the MDG. In the health sector, the indicators have slightly improved, in particular
geographical access t o health services and utilization o f health services. Significant progress has
also been made in reducing maternal mortality. Yet, achieving most o f the MDG targets o f the
sector will be challenging and will require strengthening o f the capacity o f the ministry as well as
the financing o f the sector. Substantial progress has also been made in improving education
outcomes and prospects for meeting the MDG. Nevertheless, enhancement o f the ongoing core
reforms and maintenance o f the current trends are needed for the sector to achieve i t s
development goals. Benin i s also on track to reach the MDG for rural water supply.
6.
Progress in strengthening institutional capacities and improving governance has been
mixed. Strong results have been achieved in improving public finance management but little
progress has been realized in advancing administrative and judicial system reforms. After the
preparation o f the ten-year reform plan in 2001 t o modernize the judicial system, effective
implementation and improvement o f the performance o f the justice sector have been extremely
slow. The weak internal capacity and lack o f coordination seem to be the main bottlenecks. The
c i v i l service reform has also stalled for several years due t o strong opposition from trade unions
and the parliament. However, over the last months, the government has started discussions with
the trade unions o n a new c i v i l service reform strategy that would include a revised merit-based
promotion and remuneration system and the adoption o f a single statute for government
employees covering both civil servants and contractual employees. Governance indicators have
slightly improved but Benin continues to rate poorly by international standards (1 18th out o f 179
surveyed countries according to the 2007 Transparency International report).
Bank’s contribution to Benin’s outcomes

7.
While problems o f attribution and the lack of indicators to measure the impact o f some
Bank-related interventions make i t difficult t o evaluate the specific contribution o f the Bank i t i s
clear nonetheless that IDA helped the country to achieve most o f i t s development outcomes. In
particular, the Bank was successful in providing support to maintain a stable macroeconomic
framework and improve public finance management. However, the Bank has been less successful
in advancing the structural reforms and strengthening institutional capacities due to weaker than
expected Government commitment.
Evaluation o f CAS performance

8.
Overall, Bank’s performance has been broadly satisfactory. Benin has maintained a
stable macroeconomic framework and successfully implemented the first cycle o f PRSC and
PRGF-supported programs. The CAS strategic pillars were relevant to the country’s long-term
development goals and aligned with the PRSP priorities. However, key development challenges
remain t o be addressed to materialize the objective o f the new Government to lift Benin to an
emergent economy status.
Lessons learned

9.
Bank’s assistance was more effective in the areas where the Government showed great
ownership and commitment but was less successful in the areas where the Government was not
firmly committed to implementing the program.

10.
Preparatory work and pre-existing dynamics have been critical in ensuring a progressive
transition to programmatic support.
-44 -

11.
The move to programmatic approach progressively improved the policy dialogue with the
Government and donor coordination. Nevertheless, much remains to be done to move the
harmonization agenda ahead. In particular, donor coordination should be greatly improved in
cross-cutting reforms.
12.
The impact o f the Bank’s AAA program on policy dialogue and capacity building has
been limited by the lack o f sufficient dissemination o f the results o f the analytical work. The next
CAS should ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to dissemination o f the ESW
programmed over the CAS period.
13.
Implementation o f the program has been hampered by capacity constraints, particularly in
line ministries. The next PRSC-5 will continue to focus on capacity building to support judicial
reform, civil service reform, improved public service management, and decentralization o f public
services. I t i s expected that the education and water supply sectors will continue to be supported
through the PRSC instrument, while the health sector would be covered through SWAP type
operations.
14.
Growth performance in Benin needs to be sustained by diversification and enhanced
support to private sector development through improving the overall quality o f the investment
climate. More emphasis on regional dimensions i s also needed to help the country exploit the
special opportunities from i t s geographical position.
15.
The consultation process for the next CAS should continue to build on PRSP
consultations, and focus on how IDA can best support the program o f actions set out in the PRSP11. Greater emphasis should also be given to adequate participation o f key stakeholders during the
implementation phase o f the CAS.

Completion Report for Country Assistance Strategy for Benin 2004-2006

I.Introduction
1.
This document evaluates the implementation o f the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for Benin discussed by the Board o n July 16, 2003 and which covered the fiscal years 2004-2006.
M o r e specifically, it assesses program performance and Bank performance under the 2003 CAS.
N o progress report o n i t s implementation was presented to the Board. Annex 1 summarizes
progress made in achieving the C A S outcomes while Annexes 2 and 3 compare the planned and
actual deliveries o f lending and non-lending program. Annex 4 gives the country’s current status
vis-a-vis the MDG while Annexes 5 and 6 present a summary o f the portfolio indicators.
2.
Benin reached i t s completion point under the HIPC initiative in March 2003 and was
granted debt relief totaling US$265 million in net present value terms. Benin i s also one o f the
first 19 counties that have graduated from the HIPC Initiative and will receive 100 percent
cancellation o f i t s eligible debt under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Total debt
relief from the World Bank, the IMF and the African Development Bank amounts to
approximately US$1.1 billion (60 percent o f this debt relief will be provided by IDA). In addition
to helping the country make progress towards achieving the MDGs, through ensuring adequate
budgetary allocation for basic services, the MDRI will help the country keep i t s external debt
situation on a sustainable path. Benin’s eligibility t o the MDRI reflected i t s satisfactory recent
economic performance, progress in implementing i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy and
improvements in public expenditure management. However, given the country’s limited
absorptive capacity, further strengthening o f implementation capacity o f both central and line
ministries will be essential to ensure adequate use o f scaled-up resources from the MDRI.

3.
Benin adopted i t s first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper in September 2002 and prepared
Annual Progress Reports (APR) on the PRSP implementation which were discussed during joint
annual reviews in February 2005, September 2005 and September 2006. The Government revised
i t s PRSP in April 2007 with a renewed emphasis o n accelerating and sustaining economic
growth. The PRSP-I1 will provide the strategic framework for the next CAS.
11. Benin’s Longer-term national objectives

4.
The overarching objective o f the 2003 CAS was to support the implementation o f
Benin’s Poverty Reduction Strategy 2003-2005 (discussed by the Board in March 2003). The
PRSP strategic goals were articulated around the four following pillars:

9 Consolidating macroeconomic stability through accelerated private-sector led growth and
improved public finance management;

9 Strengthening human development by improving access to quality basic social services
specially for vulnerable groups;

9 Improving governance and reinforcing institutional capacities by advancing the
decentralization and public administration reform and by strengthening the legal and
judicial systems;

9 Promoting longer-term employment and income-generating opportunities for the poor,
and strengthening their capacity to participate in decision-making and production.

-46-

5.
The C A S spelled out the following core principles in the formulation o f the strategy:
(i)
selectivity in lending through forging stronger partnerships with other donors; (ii)
closely
linking support for community-driven development t o decentralization, as required for
providing more programmatic and predictable assistance to underpin a more
sustainability; (iii)
equal partnership in implementing long-term poverty reduction strategies; and (iv) for the Bank to
assume a leadership role in capacity enhancing AAA in response to the Government’s request.
6.
The C A S also pursued the vision laid out in the Interim C A S to channeling IDA
assistance through consolidated programmatic lending in the form o f annual PRSCs.

7.
The C A S explicitly supported the three first pillars o f the PRSP while n o specific targeted
assistance was envisaged for the fourth pillar o f the Government’s strategy. This selectivity in
Bank’s support was guided by the above mentioned principles but also by the lessons learned
from the 2001 Interim C A S and C A S consultations that pointed to the need to be more selective
and for more focused and sustained Bank support. However, it was expected that Bank support to
the promotion o f equitable economic growth (Pillar 1) would indirectly support the objective of
creating more jobs and income-generating opportunities for the poor through embedding capacity
building directly into planned lending operations. In retrospect, it appears that the Bank was too
optimistic about the linkages between pillar 1 and pillar 4 but also about the growth performance
o f the economy.
8.
In light o f the growth performance under the first PRSP and the persistent l o w level o f
investment, the Government has emphasized the acceleration o f economic growth as a major
pillar o f i t s newly revised poverty reduction strategy. The next C A S should take advantage of
this opportunity t o put more emphasis on private sector development and the development o f
infrastructure services. In particular, the C A S should put a broader focus o n the improvement of
the business environment and the strengthening o f infrastructure services to raise the
competitiveness o f the economy.
9.
Benin endorsed the Millennium Declaration in September 2000 and has committed to
implement policies and programs (laid out in the PRSP) towards achieving the MDGs by 2015.
The PRSP targets were broadly consistent with the MDG but there were some differences
between the targets in the PRSP and the MDG and definitions o f indicators to monitor progress.
For example, the poverty reduction objectives were more ambitious than the MDG-related target
while health targets were less ambitious than the corresponding MDGs. According t o available
data, Benin i s likely to meet one o f the targets for MDG1, namely that o f eliminating hunger as
well as the universal primary education goal and the MDG for rural water supply. But the MDG
targets for the health sector and gender would be difficult to achieve without reinforced efforts.
Annex 4 provides an analysis o f Benin’s current status vis-a-vis the Millennium Development
Goals.

111. CAS Outcomes
10.
The specific objectives o f the C A S during the period 2004-2006 were to help Benin
achieve significant progress in the following areas:

-47

-

Bolstering the medium-term macroeconomic, through:
Accelerated private-sector-led-growth by implementing effectively the privatization
program, setting a sound regulatory framework for liberalized sectors and improving
private sector investment climate.
0

Expanded investments in the banking sector as well as expanded financing and technical
assistance to small and medium enterprises by IFC.

0

Promoting rural development by supporting the Government's comprehensive rural
development strategy along the following dimensions: (i)
develop a strategy to increase
the contribution o f cotton cultivation to poverty reduction in rural areas; (ii)
improving
land tenure and access to land ownership; and (iii)
promotion o f productive investments
necessary to diversify agricultural and livestock production systems, with special
attention devoted t o managing natural resources and other risks that impact o n
smallholder livelihoods.
Improved public finance management by supporting the Government's public finance
management reform program and strengthening administrative and financial capacity at
national and decentralized levels.

Progress in this area would be measured by the increase in the real GDP growth rate, the
reduction o f the fiscal balance, the limitation o f inflation and the increase in the investment rate.

Strengthening human development and environmental management through:
0

Improving access to education by providing responses to new school demands from the
population; improving primary education teacher distribution and management;
increasing the quality o f public spending and empowering communities in school
management; supporting the Government in preparing its ten-year sector-wide education
development plan; and providing technical support for the formulation o f alternative
policy and operational options for primary and secondary teacher training and
recruitment.

0

Improving access t o health services by supporting the implementation o f Benin's health
strategy; strengthening Government capacity to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate i t s
overall sector strategy; improving financial access o f the poor to quality health services;
helping the adoption and implementation o f more equitable mechanisms for the financing
o f the sector; and preventing new H I V / A I D S infections.
Improving access t o safe water by supporting Benin's rural water and sanitation strategy;
assuring a sound and appropriate financing for the water sector; support private and
decentralized maintenance systems and water point rehabilitation in order to increase the
rate of water point functioning; helping the Government t o improve sector
implementation capacity through strengthening o f decentralized water services for
planning, contracting and implementing; and implementing a sector monitoring and
evaluation system and strengthening donor coordination.
Environmental management through improving capacity building in the sector and
specific sector investments.

-48

-

11.
Performance indicators identified to measure progress in strengthening human
development included: the primary school enrollment ratio, the completion rate, the utilization
rate o f health services, the infant mortality rate and the share o f population with access to safe
water. No performance indicators were identified in environmental management but the GEFfinanced National Parks Conservation and Management program would continue support for
sustainable management o f Benin’s national parks.
Improving governance and institutional reforms, through:

Providing support to capacity building in public sector management; helping the
Government efforts to improve good governance through the anti-corruption action plan;
providing distance-learning opportunities for both the public and private sectors;
strengthening Government accounting, reporting, and external oversight with a special
attention to the Chamber o f Accounts.

Building strong legal and judiciary systems by supporting the implementation o f the tenyear integrated program for the development and modernization o f Benin’s legal and
judiciary system; strengthening the capacity o f the Ministry o f Justice, including the
provision o f technical advisory services, the recruitment and training o f staff, as well as
office rehabilitation and equipment; strengthening the Courts to make them more
efficient, particularly through the adoption o f new laws and regulations applicable to the
judiciary and the reorganization o f the Courts’ “grefes”, as well as through better trained
staff and equipped structures.
the
12.
Two performance indicators were established to monitor progress in this area: (i)
number o f cities meeting specific criteria has increased to at least 6 in 2005 from 3 in 2003; and
(ii)
effective monitoring and evaluation for the PRSP i s operational and credible data on poverty
trends produced on regular basis. The first indicator was too general and too complex to be
monitored over the CAS period and was not clearly linked to any o f i t s specific outcomes.

IV. Benin’s track record

13.
As stated in the 2003-2005 PRSP progress reports and their Joint Staff Advisory Notes
(JSAN), progress has been mixed in implementing the initial PRSP”. Progress has been made in
maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework and in improving key social indicators.
However, economic performance was much lower than envisaged while n o progress has been
made in reducing poverty.

14.
Macroeconomic stability has been maintained despite economic slowdown. Thus, the
CAS outcome under this first pillar can be considered satisfactory. Macroeconomic policies
conducted during the years o f implementation o f the first Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) were
appropriate and broadly in line with Benin’s PRS objectives. T h e Government continued to focus
on maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening public finance management, and
” A study that evaluated the implementation o f the PRSP during 2003-2005 also observed mixed progress in achieving
most o f the PRSP goals, and noted weaknesses in the poverty diagnosis and in the analysis o f obstacles to private sector
development. It recommended the strengthening o f the participation of the civil society, the private sector and the
beneficiaries during the preparation o f the second-generation PRSP, the improvement in the M&E system, the
sharpening o f the PSD focus of the strategy; and the improvement o f the poverty profile.

-49 -

reflecting PRSP priorities in budgetary allocations to social sectors. Overall, macroeconomic
management has remained sound despite a difficult environment as evidenced by broadly
successful implementation o f the IMF-supported program under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangements.
15.
However, as stressed in the Annual Progress Reports (APR) o f the Poverty Reduction
Strategy and their JSAN, Government efforts have been confronted by external shocks, and
economic performance was weaker than envisaged under the PRSP. Indeed, since the discussion
o f the C A S by the Board in July 2003, economic activity has been adversely affected by major
external shocks in the form o f volatile and declining international prices o f cotton and trade
restrictions imposed by Nigeria in mid-2003. As a result, real GDP growth rate decelerated from
5.2 percent o n average over 2000-02 to 3.3 percent over the 2003-2005 period, as compared with
a target o f 7.2 percent in the PRSP baseline scenario. These developments highlighted the
vulnerability o f the economy to external shocks because o f i t s heavy dependence o n cotton and
trade with Nigeria'*. The impacts o f these shocks have furthermore been exacerbated by delays in
structural reforms. This underlines the need to diversify the economy and strengthen i t s
competitiveness and constitutes a strategic goal to which the Bank needs to make a stronger
contribution under the next CAS. However, economic growth slightly recovered to 3.8 percent in
2006 reflecting a rebound in cotton and services sectors.

16.
Despite increases in the international prices, inflation was broadly contained, averaging
2.9 percent over the 2003-2006 period in line with the C A S target. Despite a 10 percent decrease
in exports volume and higher o i l prices, the external current account deficit (excluding current
official grants) narrowed from 8.1 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 7.1 percent o f GDP in 2006 as a
result o f lower formal sector o i l imports and weaker capital goods imports. But the CAS outcome
to increase the share o f private investment to GDP by one-half percentage point annually has not
been achieved.
17.
Public finance management has improved. In 2001, Benin embarked o n a number o f
significant reforms t o improve public expenditure management in order to raise the efficiency and
transparency o f public spending and to improve the quality and poverty-focus o f public service
de1ive1-y'~. Since then, public finance reforms have been consolidated and progress in
implementing public expenditure management, fiduciary management, and auditing systems has
been encouraging as noticed by the last HIPC Assessment Action Plan2'. Delegation o f spending
authority granted to line ministries has been strengthened and budget formulation and preparation
have improved with the adoption and the submission to the parliament o f a detailed and rolling
M e d i u m Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and sectoral program budgets within many
ministries, reflecting PRSP priorities. The budget execution and reporting systems have also been
computerized and budget transparency and public access to data on government activities
improved while the new procurement l a w has been adopted in 2004 and the National Regulatory

'*

Cotton i s the major primary export commodity with about 65 percent o f total exports over 2003-06 while transit trade
with Nigeria i s estimated to represent between 6.5 and 7.5 percent o f GDP.
19

These reforms have been supported by the PERAC (Public Expenditure Reform Adjustment Credit)
which was the precursor to the first cycle o f PRSC which benefited from the reforms undertaken under this
prior operation.

*' Benin met 7 out o f the 14 expenditure management benchmarks in the June 2005 HIPC Assessment Action Plan. The
2005 CFAA update published in June also confirmed this assessment. The conclusions o f the 2007 CFAA update seem
to indicate the same trends.

- 50 -

Agency for Procurement (CNRMP) and the National Executing Agency for Public Procurement
(DNMP) established. These measures have contributed to improve the P F M performance
indicators. The overall budget deficit (on a payment order basis and excluding grants) was limited
at 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2006 as against a target o f 4.5 percent o f GDP in the 2003 CAS. The
average payment delay for public expenditures was reduced from 24.4 in 2003 to 22.9 days at the
end o f the C A S period.
18.
Despite these achievements, there are still weaknesses in monitoring resources allocated
in the budget (internal and external resources) and in accounting. In particular, there have been
some delays in completing budget audit reports due to lack o f resources and lack o f independence
in managing resources for the Chamber o f Accounts. Further, certain bottlenecks in spending
procedures hindered the execution o f some sector program budgets. Budget execution rates
(excluding externally-financed investment expenditures) for the priority sectors21 have slightly
deteriorated from 93.4 percent in 2002 to 73.0 percent in 2006. Moreover, the CAS objective o f
integrating all expenditures in the budget management computerized system (SIGFIP) has not
been achieved as some foreign grants are not s t i l l included in the system. In addition, there has
been a recent tendency to circumvent the standard expenditure process through the use o f
exceptional procedures during budget execution. But the new Government has taken appropriate
and effective measures to limit the use o f these procedures.
19.
The Government also adopted in December 2005, a policy framework for Resultsoriented Budget Management (GBAR for Gestion Budgdtaire Axde sur les Rdsultats). The GBAR
strategy was based o n the 2005 CFAA update and other public financial management reviews,
including recent PERs and PEFA assessments. The objectives o f the policy are to use resultsbased budget management as a means to ensure service delivery and to ensure that public
expenditures are used efficiently in the service o f development and o f citizen welfare. The
GBAR also intends to raise fiduciary standards by improving public procurement and financial
management. However, the GBAR strategy notes that for the budget system to achieve i t s
objectives, weaknesses in human and institutional capacity will need to be overcome. The next
C A S should explore ways to assist the Government in this endeavor.
20.
Progress in implementing structural reforms has been mixed. The pace o f
implementation o f the privatization program and establishment o f the appropriate regulatory
frameworks in privatized sectors has been slow. After the separation o f the water and electricity
companies o n one hand and that o f the postal services and the telecommunications o n the other in
2004, new regulatory texts have been drafted for electricity and telecoms, but i t took a longer
time than anticipated to put in place the regulatory bodies. In the energy sector, although some
progress has been made in defining the sector policy and the rehabilitation program for the
National Electricity Distribution Company, SBEE, the new regulatory code has yet to be
approved by Parliament, which delays reaching agreement on the regulator’s prerogatives.
Similarly, in the telecoms sector, although a new legal and regulatory framework was adopted in
January 2002, installation o f the regulatory agency has been delayed until very recently. Also, the
implementation o f Government’s strategy t o open port management to the private sector did not
progress significantly. In the cotton sector, the current framework defining the relationship among
the various stakeholders has been under stress, and the privatization o f the cotton parastatal,
SONAPRA (which was initially supposed to be completed within the C A S timeframe) has been
repeatedly blocked. However, the new Government has shown greater commitment to speed up
the implementation of the structural reforms program. In 2008, i t has set targets for cotton sector

21

Health, Basic Education, Water, Agriculture, Transport and Justice.

-51 -

reforms, including privatization o f factories, and withdrawal from involvement in the sector as
private sector involvement increases.
21.
Progress in improving the business climate for the private sector has also been slow.
Although business regulations in Benin are broadly at par with SSA averages according to
international assessments (including the 2005 ICA and D o i n g Business reports), the business
climate continued to be marked by poor regulations and governance which resulted in very high
administrative costs (Benin ranked 137 out o f the 175 countries in the 2007 D o i n g Business
Report). For example, it s t i l l takes 7 procedures and 31 days and costs twice the average annual
income to register a business in Benin while it takes 49 procedures and 720 days o n average to
enforce contracts. Other obstacles reported by businesses included: harassment by fiscal
authorities (according to the 2007 D o i n g Business report, total tax rate represents 68.5 percent o f
profits while the number o f tax payments averaged 72 in 2006); poor and expensive utility
services and difficult access t o land. High corruption and poor contract enforcement by the
judiciary system constitute other main concerns to investors. This explains why private
investment in Benin has remained almost constant at 12 percent o f GDP during the CAS period
and foreign direct investment at 2 percent o f GDP (whereas the C A S objective was to increase the
investment rate by one-half percentage point per year). However, key positive steps taken with
regard to the PSD agenda include the creation o f the Presidential Investment Council in February
2007. Progress in expanding investments in the banking sector as well as expanding financing
and technical assistance to S M E was also l o w due to weaker than envisaged involvement o f I F C
in Benin. Indeed, over the C A S period, IFC’s portfolio in Benin consisted o f only a US$0.34
m i l l i o n investment in Finadev, a microfinance institution. However, IFC’s recent strategy for
Africa calls for increased engagement with the private sector o f IDA countries, specifically the
francophone countries in the CFA zone. Reflecting this move, a close collaboration i s envisaged
between the Bank and IFC, under the next CAS, to support the development o f the financial
sector and the SMEs.
22.
Progress in reducing poverty has been mixed. While Government’s Second PRSP
(Stratbgie de Croissance pour la Reduction de la Pauvretk: S C W ) reported that monetary
poverty increased from 28.5 percent in 2002 to 37.4 percent in 2006, the changes in the design
and methodology o f the surveys, the EMICOV and the 2002 CWIQ (Core Welfare Indicators
Questionnaire) put in question the comparability o f the poverty estimates in 2002 and 2006.
Indeed, as was noted in the JSANs o f two recent PRSP documents, the increase in GDP per capita
combined with the decrease in inequality recorded over the 2003-2006 period bolster the
conclusion that poverty has decreased, although modestly. Moreover, results based on variables
representing conditions o f life22also indicate a modest decline in non-monetary poverty from 43
percent in 2002 to 40.3 percent in 2006. These positive trends are more consistent with the
evolution o f per-capita income, although modest. All these developments stress the necessity o f
developing more robust poverty statistics that are comparable over time and more importantly to
put in place a sound monitoring and evaluation system that will help to track progress under the
next CAS.
23.
Rural development has been very limited. Over the C A S period, the incidence o f nonmonetary poverty in rural areas remained almost constant at 59 percent compared with 18.4
percent in urban areas. This reflected weaker than projected economic performance and
particularly the declining contribution o f the agriculture sector to GDP growth. T h i s growth path
reflected the poor performance o f the cotton sector that has been affected by the volatility o f
22

The “living conditions” approach consists in defining the level o f poverty on the basis o f material
housing conditions.

-52

-

international prices but also by the disruptions which have characterized the functioning o f the
‘tfili8i-e” over the last years. As a result, the C A S objective with regards to poverty reduction has
not been achieved (the C A S objective was to reduce rural monetary poverty to 27.1 percent by
2006). This highlights the fact that strengthening agriculture revenues and identifying new
contributors to growth to diversify producers’ incomes will be key to reducing poverty in rural
areas. This, in turn, will require addressing the main bottlenecks to the development and
diversification o f the agriculture sector, such as high cost and l o w quality o f infrastructure
services, lack o f technologies and knowledge, and l o w quality o f agricultural products.
24.
Good progress has been made in improving rural electrification. Over the first PRSP
period, electrification rates in rural areas have increased from 0.2 percent to 5.6 percent. Also, the
Government has continued to improve i t s interventions in rural transport with the adoption o f the
Strategy Note in December 2004. However, the execution o f rural roads rehabilitation program
has been slow due to delay in procurement procedures and problems related t o timely availability
o f funds.
25.
Progress has been made in improving human development. Overall achievement
under this pillar can be considered satisfactory. The different APR published during the first
PRSP period showed that some progress has been achieved in improving access to basic social
services but recognized that further efforts would be needed to reach the MDG. In the health
sector, the indicators have improved slightly between 2001 and 2006. Geographical access to
health services has increased to 86 percent and the utilization rate o f health services has improved
from 34 percent in 2001 to 43.9 percent in 2006 (well above the C A S target o f 37 percent ) while
maternal mortality has decreased from 474.4 per 100,000 live births in 2002 to 397 per 100,000
live births in 2006. Yet, this progression would be insufficient to reach the MDG target.
However, Benin has significantly reduced child mortality from 160 per 1,000 live births in 2000
to 125 in 2006 suggesting that the country i s o n track to reach the MDG target. With regards to
HIV/AIDS, the prevalence rate decreased from 4.1 percent in 2001 to 1.2 percent in 2006 (2.9
percentage point below the C A S target) with the implementation o f the 2000-2005 national
strategic plan. As a result, the objective o f maintaining the prevalence rate below 4 percent
through 2015 i s achievable. However, many constraints need t o be addressed in order to improve
the performance o f the health system. In particular, the capacity o f the ministry needs to be
strengthened, both at central and decentralized levels and the financing o f the health sector
increased. Financial access o f the poor to quality health services needs also to be improved.
26.
Significant progress has been made in increasing access to education in general and
particularly to basic education. The primary gross enrollment ratio increased from 90 percent in
2002 to 96 percent in 2006 (compared with a C A S target o f 93.6 percent) while the gross
enrollment ratio for girls rose from 80 percent to 87 percent over the same period. So, Benin i s on
track to reach the MDG related target. Although the completion rate has increased from 46
percent in 2002 to 66 percent in 2006 (the C A S objective was 57 percent), reaching this MDG
will be challenging. Also, while gender differences in education have been reduced, particularly
at the primary level, the 2005 goal o f parity in primary and secondary education has not been met
and would not be reached by 20 15 without reinforced effort. K e y challenges facing the education
sector include persistent geographic and gender disparities, l o w quality o f education despite
recent improvements, and the need t o further define the measures to address issues in higher
education and vocational training. Overall, enhancement o f the ongoing core reforms and sharp
acceleration o f the current trends are needed for the sector to achieve i t s development goals.
27.
The Government has also made significant progress in increasing access to potable water
to the rural population from 35 percent in 2002 to 44 percent in 2006 and water facilities

- 53 -

functionality rate has improved f r o m 75 percent in 2002 to 85 percent in 2006. As a result, Benin
i s o n track to reach the MDG for rural water supply. That new prospect regarding the MDG i s the
result o f the successful programmatic approach implemented in partnership with the Bank and
other donors. The Government has also taken strong measures to improve the execution capacity
o f the sector that has more than doubled between 2001 and 2004. Although Benin i s on track to
reach the MDG for rural water supply, maintaining these trends will require substantial resources
for new construction and maintenance, along with community participation to improve the quality
o f service.
28.
Reflecting the implementation o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Government
constantly increased budgetary resources for basic services and pro-poor expenditures. Enhanced
fiscal space for poverty-reducing spending was largely helped by debt relief under the HIPC
initiative. Between 2003 and 2006, the share o f budgetary allocations to poverty reduction
programs in the total budget increased by 4 percentage points. However, weak implementation
capacity limited the translation o f higher budget allocations into increased executed spending, in
particular for investment expenditures. But over the last months, the Government has reinforced
i t s efforts to address the implementation capacity constraints. Measures taken by the authorities
include the recruitment o f additional staff in key technical positions, including specialists for
procurement cells within line ministries and the National Directorate for Public Procurement
(DNMP), the strengthening o f programming capacity o f sectoral ministries and closer monitoring
o f budget execution. The Bank should continue to support Government’s efforts in this area
through i t s PRSCs.
29.
Progress in strengthening institutional capacities and improving governance has been
mixed. The rating under this pillar is moderately unsatisfactory. Although strong results have
been achieved in improving public finance management (see paragraph 15), little progress has
been realized in advancing administrative and judicial system reforms. Benin prepared with the
Bank’s support an exhaustive ten-year reform plan in 2001 t o modernize the judicial system in
the interest o f improving service delivery, including services t o the private sector such as dispute
resolution, but effective implementation and improvement o f the performance o f the justice sector
have been extremely slow and delays continue to accumulate. The weak internal capacity, lack o f
leadership and coordination and chronic insufficiency o f funds seem t o be the main bottlenecks.
30.
With regard to public administration reform, after the preparation o f all background
documentations in 2004, the civil service reform has stalled for several years due to strong
opposition from trade unions and the parliament. However, over the last months, the government
has started discussions with the trade unions on a new civil service reform strategy that would
include a revised merit-based promotion and remuneration system and the adoption o f a single
statute for government employees covering both c i v i l servants and contractual employees. The
Ministry o f Civil Service and Administrative Reform (MFPTRA) has hired technical assistance to
prepare the draft statute. I t will be crucial for the text to be specific on the career and the
performance based management system, rather than leaving development o f these critical issues
to later decrees. K e y human resources management responsibilities have been delegated to the
education ministries and the positive evaluation o f this process constitutes the basis for planning
further deconcentration to more line ministries (with necessary capacity building in parallel, since
the evaluation highlighted this as a weakness o f the previous process). M o r e recently, the
institutional framework for the integration, coordination and monitoring o f the administrative
reforms (CNRA, CCRA) has been implemented, and all cells within line ministries have n o w
been put in place.

- 54 -

3 1.
On decentralization, the regulatory framework for the decentralization reform has been
established with 10 decrees adopted by the cabinet, and a further decree establishing communal
development funds has been discussed jointly with donors. Notwithstanding this legal arsenal,
implementation o f the decentralization process and policy has been slow due to many
postponements o f the local elections, the lack o f operational modalities for the mandated transfers
and an unclear implementation institutional framework.
32.
O n governance, CPIA ratings and Transparency International reports indicate that Benin
has made some progress in this area. CPIA rating slightly improved from 3.5 in 2003 to 3.6 in
2006 (compared with an average o f 3.2 for the Africa region). With an overall score o f 2.7 from
Transparency International in 2007, Benin rates also relatively well in SSA (21st out o f 50
countries). But Benin rates poorly by international standards (1 18th out o f 179 surveyed
countries). A comparison o f the six governance indicators identified by WBI as critical to
monitoring a country’s progress indicates that voice and accountability improved between 2002
and 2006 as did governance and the control o f corruption. However, political stability, respect for
the r u l e o f law and regulatory quality slightly deteriorated over the same period.
33.
This reflects the situation o f a country undergoing reforms but with major challenges in
tackling corruption. After defining i t s anti-corruption plan, the previous Government stalled all
concrete anti-corruption measures in the last couple o f years. The main difficulties encountered
in the past in the fight against corruption have been: a lack o f political will and poor collaboration
among institutions; very weak law enforcement; very limited sanctions imposed on known cases
o f corruption and fraud, creating a general sense o f impunity that has weakened the entire
institutional setup. However, since April 2006, the new Government has put strong emphasis on
fighting corruption and has adopted firm measures to promote good governance.
34.
Overall, Benin has made good progress in meeting i t s development goals. I t has achieved
most o f the CAS outcomes and the triggers for the base case. However, progress made has not
been sufficient to move to the high case lending scenario. For example, completion o f the
structural reforms and implementation o f comprehensive administrative reform program have not
been satisfactory due to lack o f Government commitment and the opposition o f trade unions.

V. How the Bank contributed to Benin’s progress
35.
Although the 2003 CAS was not a result-based strategy, it developed a Country
Partnership Strategy Matrix (CPSM) and core CAS benchmarks that would help assess progress
in implementing the assistance program. These benchmarks and targets were derived from the
PRSP M&E framework and reflected the selective areas o f Bank involvement during the CAS
period. Thus, they represented the country’s outcomes to which the CAS proposed to make a
contribution. The Country Partnership Strategy Matrix i s reproduced below with the initial
targets, the current status and the associated CAS instrument that was supposed to influence the
outcome.
36.
W h i l e problems o f attributionz3 and the lack o f indicators to measure the impact o f some
Bank-related interventions (in the areas o f judicial system and social protection and gender
promotion for e ~ a m p l e ) ’make
~
it difficult to evaluate the specific contribution o f the Bank to
23

The transition to budget support has compounded t h i s issue o f attribution.

24 Other weaknesses identified in the CPSM included the absence o f specific targets for some indicators,
the difficulty o f measuring some indicators and the lack o f clear baseline. Addressing these weaknesses and

-55-

Benin’s strategic outcomes under the CAS period, it i s clear nonetheless that IDA helped the
country to achieve most o f i t s development outcomes. In particular, the Bank was successful in
providing support to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework and improve public finance
management. However, the Bank has been less successful in advancing the structural reforms and
strengthening institutional capacities due to weaker than expected Government’s collaboration.
37.
A review o f the Country Partnership Strategy M a t r i x below shows that most o f the
key CAS outcomes have been achieved. About 75 percent o f the CAS outcomes were achieved,
including those most relevant to Benin’s longer-term development goals. Macroeconomic
stability has been maintained with inflation being limited to less than 4.0 percent on average over
the CAS period; public expenditure management has been strengthened with the reduction o f the
fiscal deficit from 4.2 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2006; the incidence o f
HIV/AIDS has been contained below the CAS target; rural population with access to safe water
has increased from 35 percent in 2002 to 44 percent in 2006 while higher number o f households
has access to electricity. However, the CAS achievements were less than those envisaged, in
particular with respects to expanded private sector and broad-based growth, poverty reduction,
the privatization program, the strengthening o f institutional capacities and the effectiveness o f the
M&E framework for the PRSP. Poverty incidence has sharply increased and progress towards the
MDG has been mixed. Also, the monitoring and evaluation framework for the PRSP has not been
fully operational and production o f reliable data on poverty trends has been limited. Annex 1
provides a detailed analysis o f progress on the CPSM and lessons learnt.

strengthening the monitoring and evaluation framework of Bank’s interventions should be one o f the
objectives o f the next CAS.

The 2003 CAS identified six major risks that could affect the attainment o f i t s outcomes.
These included: (i)
the economy’s vulnerability to a further drop in cotton prices and/or in cotton

- 59 -

production; (ii)
risk to the macroeconomic framework; (iii)
economic and political developments
in Nigeria; (iv) weak institutional capacity; (v) implementation delays linked to Benin’s
democratic political environment. At least three o f these r i s k s materialized during the
implementation o f the strategy. Indeed, the intensification o f trade restrictions in Nigeria2* and the
strengthening o f border controls resulted in a substantial decline in trade and transport activities
that affected the services sector and its contribution to GDP growth. One other important
exogenous factor that has negatively affected the C A S outcome i s the significant decline in world
prices for cotton. Given the importance o f the cotton sector for Benin’s
the slump in
international cotton prices during the C A S period has significantly affected economic growth and
poverty rates, particularly in rural areas. Due t o the poor performance o f the cotton sector and
weaker than projected transit activities, the assumptions underlying the economic growth
projections did not materialize. Actual GDP growth rate averaged 3.3 percent over 2003-2005 as
against 6.5 percent in the CAS.
39.
Also, further delays in implementing critical structural reforms, in particular the
privatization program and setting-up appropriate regulatory frameworks in privatized sectors have
affected the C A S outcome related to the increase in private sector investment. Between 2002 and
2006, the share o f private investment in GDP has remained almost constant at 12 percent (see
paragraph 19), i.e., 2.0 points below the C A S target.

40.
In the light o f these developments, the country team should pay more attention to the
understanding and analysis o f the risks that may affect negatively the implementation o f the next
C A S and identify ex-ante the best ways to manage and mitigate them.
41.
There were n o major sectoral reforms envisaged under the C A S with respect to
environment management. This main objective o f the C A S in this area was to ensure that the
urban environmental management as well as the forest management programs were properly
funded, implemented and monitored. The Bank supported the implementation o f the MEHU’s
program budgets and strategic investments. It has also provided support to the implementation o f
the Government’s Medium-Term Strategic Plan (2002-2006) adopted in 2002. This helped the
Ministry o f Environment to strengthen its environmental management tools and environmental
compliance and increase investments to address urban sanitation and urban air pollution in
Cotonou. In addition, although Bank operations were not expected to have any significant
negative environmental or social impacts, IDA helped the country to strengthen i t s capacities to
manage environmental and social risks. T o this end, the Bank supported the establishment o f
small environmental units within key line ministries and the training o f their staffs in identifying
and implementing measures for mitigating any adverse environmental or social impacts o f public
investment programs. Finally, according t o environmental assessments and social analysis
undertaken during the C A S period, implementation o f the Bank’s assistance program did not have
any significant unanticipated negative consequence.

VI. The Bank’s performance

In August 2003, Nigerian authorities extended the import prohibition list from 29 to 44 products
imported from Benin.

According to the National Institute o f Statistics, the cotton sector accounts for about two-thirds o f
Benin’s exports, 10 percent o f total value added, provides income to about 350, 000 poor farmers and
touches an estimated 40 percent o f the country’s total population.
29

- 60 -

42.
Overall, the Bank performance has been satisfactory. The move towards consolidated
programmatic lending (with PRSC being the major instrument o f Bank’s assistance) has helped to
strengthen the alignment o f Bank’s program to the Government’s priorities and strategies as laid
out in the PRSP. The 2003 CAS program assistance has contributed to the maintenance of
macroeconomic stability and to the improvement o f public finance management. But as already
noted, progress in structural reforms was less than expected while Bank’s contribution to the
strengthening o f institutional weaknesses has been mixed as confirmed by Benin’s Country Case
Study for the Madavo report (see paragraphs 46).
43.
Quality of the Portfolio. According to the I C R reviews conducted by IEG for the Benin
projects which closed over the period FY04-08 (see Annex 6), 57% o f the outcomes o f the
evaluated projects during this period were satisfactory. Bank overall performance was rated
satisfactory only for 50% o f projects, and institutional development impact and sustainability
were 75 percent and 60 percent, respectively. This reflects the weakness in implementation
capacity in the Benin administration and the need for stronger monitoring and evaluation systems,
issues which will be addressed in the next CAS. One project, the First Decentralized City
Management Project which closed in September 2004, was evaluated very positively by IEG with
a high institutional development rating. The follow-on project, approved in FY06, i s also
performing very well and has been supplemented by an additional financing project in FY08.
44.
Over the period o f the FY04-06 CAS, the percentage o f commitments at risk has gone
from 14 percent in FY04 to 46 percent in FY05 (almost half the portfolio) down to 22 percent in
FY06. Annex 5 provides a summary o f the portfolio indicators. The two potential problem
projects identified in FY05, GEF National Parks Conservation and MAP/HN A I D S , closed
respectively, in 2005 and 2006. A new HIV/AIDS MAP project was approved in FY07. The two
problem projects identified in FY05 (Cotton Sector Reform and Energy Service Delivery)
remained problem projects in FY07. In the case o f Cotton Sector Reform, which closed in June
2008, this was due to the Government’s continued lack o f action o n reform o f the cotton sector
and transition to a more liberal and competitive system3’. With regard to Energy Service
Delivery Project which has had significant delays as reflected in the l o w levels o f disbursement, a
mid-term review was concluded in mid-2008 with agreements reached on a project restructuring
plan and measures to speed up disbursements and enhance project implementation. The Project
was upgraded to “satisfactory” in FY08. An Additional Financing for this Project was approved
in June 2008. The Private Sector Project was downgraded to “moderately unsatisfactory” in the
last ISR in FY08 and was rated unsatisfactory in the ICR and by IEG. This was due to lack o f
capacity and commitment o f Government to implement the privatization program. The follow on
Private Sector Project (approved in FY08) will build on the outcomes achieved under the PSD
project, particularly in capacity building for small and medium enterprises, export promotion and
public private dialogue.

The overall disbursement ratio o f about 30.3 percent for the period 2004 to 2006
45.
compares favorably to the CAS target o f 20 percent and to an average o f about 25 percent for the
Africa Region (FY05/06). The improved disbursement ratio i s due in large part to the quick
disbursing PRSC operations starting in FY04. The last CPPRs have reported that the
implementation o f projects continues to be affected by long delays in effectiveness (on average 68 months after Board approval) and in mobilization o f counterpart funds. T h e application o f the
30

The Government’s decision in November 2007 t o cancel the process o f partial privatization o f
SONAPRA, the ginning company, put the development objectives o f the project at risk. Recently, in 2008,
the Government has started to move ahead o n cotton sector reforms, including privatization o f factories.

U s e of instruments and AAA work. With the progressive shift towards consolidated
programmatic support, the PRSC has become the key instrument o f channeling IDA assistance to
the country. I t has progressively become an important instrument o f the policy dialogue with the
Government and donor coordination. Several pieces o f economic and sector work were
undertaken by the Bank during the C A S period and served as input t o the design o f the first series
o f PRSCs. They also informed the preparation o f the second generation o f PRSP. In particular,
strong analytical work was carried out o n private sector development and supported the
development o f a PSD strategy adopted by the Government in September 2006. The major
studies include: (i)an Investment Climate Assessment (FY 06) which identified the major
impediments to private sector development and its results were used to develop a realistic growth
the findings o f the Annual D o i n g Business indicators which
strategy led by the private sector; (ii)
a F I A S L a n d Market Study
also provided an input to the preparation o f the PSD strategy; (iii)
which examined ways to improve the access o f the private sector t o industrial, commercial, and
residential property; (iv) the Financial Sector Review which provided a diagnosis o f the financial
system in Benin and identified issues that need to be addressed by Government and policy makers
for the financial system to become a better growth engine; and (v) a Public Expenditure Review
completed in December 2004 which focused on an analysis o f expenditures in health, education
and rural water supply and sanitation to help sharpen the sectoral content o f the PRSCs. A
Poverty Assessment was also produced in September 2003 and provided a better understanding o f
poverty issues in Benin, in particular the determinants o f poverty, inequality and vulnerability as
well as poverty in rural areas. T h i s Poverty Assessment was complemented by the Country
Health Status Report in 2004 which provided updated information for the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper o f factors contributing to poor health and identified public actions that could
mitigate the impoverishing impact o f disease. Finally, the portfolio benefited fkom substantial
analytical work in the area o f governance, civil service reform and decentralization which helped
to sharpen the reform content o f the PRSC program. A country assessment o f the AAA program
conducted by the QAG in M a y 2007 rated the quality o f the program satisfactory. M o r e
specifically, the strategic relevance, internal quality, coherence and integration and likely impact
were rated satisfactory while Bank inputs and processes and dialogue and dissemination were
rated moderately satisfactory.

47.
Lending: The 2004 CAS proposed a base-case lending and grant program o f about
US$200 million for the period FY04-06, with US$220 million planned for the high case (higher
amounts for the two PRSCs). In FY04-06, IDA provided financing o f US$217 million, including
a GEF project, o f which US$43.3 million in grants. Nearly all the projects planned at the time o f
the CAS were delivered in the period reviewed for this CASCR (see Annex 3 for a detailed
presentation o f the planned lending program and actual delivery). The main difference with the
CAS planned lending program was that the PRSC-3 was initially planned for FY06 but was
approved in FY07 reflecting delays in implementation o f the reform program. In addition, an
Electricity Services I1 Project, planned for FY06, was delayed to early FY09, following a
Government request to review the design o f the project; while a Malaria Control Booster Program
(US$3 1 million grant) was added in FY06 to support implementation o f the Government’s 20062010 Roll Back Malaria Strategic Plan. Finally, in FY06, the other deviations with the CAS plan
were that a GEF Forest and Adjacent Land Management Project (US$6 million) went to the
Board, as well a US$15 million credit under the West Africa Power Pool Facility to facilitate
cross-border exchanges o f electricity between BenidTogo, Ghana and Nigeria until 2020.
Reflecting these important modifications, the amount lent (US$ 2 17 million) during the CAS
period was close to that for the high case though the triggers for this scenario were not met (see
paragraph 29).
48.
Capacity enhancement. Although the preparation o f the AAA program mentioned
above in partnership with the Government and other domestic stakeholders has contributed to
enhance the country’s analytical capacity, the Bank’s contribution to Benin’s capacity building
program has been limited as evidenced by an Independent Review o f World Bank Support for
Capacity Building in Benin3’.W h i l e the priorities o f the 2003 CAS demonstrated an increased
focus in capacity building in the context o f the move to programmatic lending, the
implementation o f the Bank’s interventions was less satisfactory, due largely to shortcomings in
diagnosis o f needs and constraints and the limited impact o f training and technical assistance. The
Bank’s contribution was also limited by the ageing o f staff and shortages in certain critical s k i l l s
following the freeze on recruitment during the 1990’s. During the CAS period, the Government
has also taken on major new administrative procedures in MTEF as well as sector program
budgets, PRSP monitoring and evaluation and budget execution; procurement, financial controls,
and deconcentration and decentralization but lack o f information on these new procedures and to
a lesser extent difficulties in adapting to new systems led to resistance and delays hampering
Bank’s contribution to capacity development efforts. The WBI has conducted training programs
in Benin for many years. Over the CAS period, a forum on public finance was organized and
training programs were also held for ministry officials involved in IDA’Sprogrammatic lending
activities. In light o f these developments, the next CAS should identify and strengthen the
country’s needed capacities to implement and monitor the progress under the new strategy,
bearing in mind that transition to direct budget support requires new approaches to capacity
building, including demand-driven technical assistance.
49.
Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation were weak during the first years
of implementation o f the PRSP but the functioning and effectiveness o f the M&E framework has
increased since that time as reflected by the clarification o f the roles and responsibilities o f the
two main technical structures o f the system, i.e. the Monitoring Unit for Economic and Structural
3’ Benin was one o f the six countries which were chosen for an independent evaluation by OED o f the
relevance and effectiveness o f Bank’s support for public support capacity building in Africa over the 19952004 period. The review concentrated o n four focal areas: education, health, roads and public expenditure
management. OED rated the Bank’s overall support t o capacity building in B e n i n as moderately

unsatisfactory.

- 64 -

Reform Program (CSPRES) and the Observatory o f Social Conditions (OCS) and the
establishment o f monitoring and evaluation units in line ministries. Moreover, during the revision
o f the PRSP, the Government broadened the set o f monitoring indicators, and prepared a detailed
Priority Action Plan (PAP) which establishes a sound monitoring and evaluation framework for
assessing progress under the strategy and offers a more appropriate institutional framework for
monitoring the implementation o f the next CAS.
50.
However, some problems remain and need to be addressed to achieve a more efficient
system. In the joint staff advisory note o f the PRSP-11, Bank and IMF staffs have underlined the
continued lack o f reliable data for a number o f indicators, including poverty statistics. They
therefore stress the need to improve the availability and quality o f data and to strengthen the
national statistical system.

5 1.
Consultations. The 2003 C A S benefited f r o m extensive consultations with all
stakeholders including Government, c i v i l society, beneficiaries, private sector and the donor
community. I t also benefited from the nation-wide consultations held during the preparation o f
the first PRSP. These consultations helped to align the C A S strategic pillars with the priorities of
the PRSP as well as to refine the C A S strategic objectives and the lending and non-lending
program. However, it i s not clear to what extent these groups have been involved during the
implementation o f the CAS. The next CAS will continue to benefit from the extensive
consultations held by the Government with a broad range o f stakeholders during the revision of
the PRSP. But this time, the team should pay more attention to adequate participation o f key
stakeholders during the implementation phase o f the CAS.
52.
A client survey carried out in June 2007 provided u s e f i l feedback from key stakeholders
(Government, Bank-financed project implementation units, development partners, members o f
the civil society, representatives o f the private sector, academia, and the media) regarding their
perceptions o f the Bank and o f i t s contribution to Benin's development outcomes. The Bank was
most valued by the clients surveyed for its financial resources, i t s contribution to the promotion o f
country ownership and i t s collaboration with government and donors. However, the Bank
received very negative ratings on whether it i s flexible in the way it adjusts t o changing
circumstances and on' whether the strategies i t recommends are sustainable and realistic. Finally,
respondents found that the Bank works too much with Government. These findings pointed out to
the need for the Bank to better demonstrate its effectiveness o n the ground, strengthen the
dialogue with other key stakeholders in Benin, in particular with civil society and private sector
and improve its communication about i t s role, including with respect to poverty reduction.
53.
Aid coordination. The PRSP process has fostered collaboration between the Bank and
other development partners. Joint Government-donors reviews were regularly carried out in the
core sectors o f rural water, health, and education during the C A S period and l e d to concrete
recommendations and agreements aimed at strengthening the alignment o f programs and
technical assistance and institutional support to sector strategies. Discussions are underway to
expand this promising experience to other sectors, such as agriculture and transport. Moreover,
donor coordination has improved particularly with respect to budget support. Since 2004, joint
mission o f the main donors that are providing budget support for PRSP implementation took
place each year in September. Agreement has been reached by the participating donors and the
Government to use a unique policy matrix to monitor the implementation o f main structural and
sectoral reforms program. The government and development partners have also started
discussions o n the implementation o f the Paris Declaration in Benin. A stocktaking report on aid
effectiveness in Benin was finalized in October 2006 and an agreement has been reached on the
Monitoring and Evaluation framework o f the Paris Declaration and a joint Government-partners

- 65 -

technical group on aid effectiveness, chaired by the Minister o f Planning and Development
(MEPDEAP), was established for this purpose. However, all parties recognize the need to
improve reform monitoring and reporting and to accelerate the pace o f harmonization. In this
regard, a Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Government and the
development partners providing budget support in December 2007 to consolidate the
achievements.

54.
During the implementation o f the CAS, IDA continued to closely collaborate with IMF.
In particular, the staffs o f both institutions conducted joint PRSP missions and prepared joint
assessments on the PRSP Progress Reports. Bank and Fund teams have also closely coordinated
the contents o f their respective programs as well as the determination o f their respective triggers,
with the PRSC covering the structural and social benchmarks while the PRGF covered
macroeconomic issues.
VII. Lessons learned.

55.
Assistance i s more effective in the areas that are top priorities o f the Government.
Although CAS alignment with the PRSP was a critical factor in ensuring that Bank’s program
supported Benin’s development agenda, i t s contribution to the country’s outcomes varied across
sectors. Bank’s support was most effective in the areas where the Government showed great
ownership and commitment such as public finance management and macroeconomic stability but
was less successful in the areas where the Government was not firmly committed to
implementing the program such as the civil service reform.
56.
Preparatory work and pre-existing dynamics have been critical in ensuring a progressive
transition to programmatic support. For example, implementation o f the PRSC-supported
program greatly benefited from the achievements under the PERAC in developing Government
capacity in results-budgeting and from the public expenditure management reforms undertaken
under this operation. Nevertheless, the program was too ambitious and the implementation
capacity overestimated. The new series o f PRSC should seek to improve the understanding and
ownership o f the process and support more strongly capacity building efforts.

57.
The move to programmatic approach progressively improved the policy dialogue with the
Government and donor coordination. I t also helped strengthen the alignment o f external partners’
support with the PRSP. Nevertheless, much remains to be done to move the harmonization
agenda ahead. In particular, donor coordination should be greatly improved in cross-cutting
reforms, such as civil service reform and decentralization, and new programs, such as in
governance.
58.
Despite progress made in addressing the weaknesses identified in the JSA3* o f the first
PRSP, much remain to be done to improve the availability and quality o f data needed to monitor
the results. As discussed in the JSAN o f the PRSP-11, reliable data for a number o f PRSP-I1
indicators are still lacking. The next CAS should support efforts to strengthen the monitoring and
evaluation capacities and the establishment o f a results-based M&E framework. These efforts will
be much needed as the Bank and the other donors are progressively adopting results-based
~trategies~~.

32

See IDA/SecM2003-0076, February 2003.

33

For example, the Bank’s next CAS will be a results-based strategy.

- 66 -

59.
The impact o f the Bank’s AAA program on policy dialogue and capacity building has
been limited by the lack o f sufficient dissemination o f the results o f the analytical work as noted
by a recent QAG’s assessment o f eight AAA carried out during FY02-06. The next CAS should
ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to the dissemination o f the results o f the ESW
programmed over the CAS period. The Bank’s team should also make sure that the AAA
program i s more effectively utilized to broaden and inform the reform program and development
dialogue.
60.
Growth performance in Benin needs to be sustained by enhanced support to private sector
development and through diversification. The economy’s vulnerability to a single crop, cotton,
and to trade with Nigeria calls for a redoubling o f efforts to promote more broad-based growth
through agricultural diversification and improved competitiveness o f the secondary and tertiary
sectors. Accelerating economic growth will also require improving the overall quality o f the
investment climate through a strengthening o f the institutional policy and regulatory frameworks,
the adequacy and quality o f infrastructure as well as an effective judicial system and a wellfunctioning financial system.
61.
More emphasis on regional dimensions i s needed to help the country to exploit the
special opportunities from i t s geographical position.
62.
Implementation o f the program has been hampered by capacity constraints, particularly in
line ministries. The Bank needs to continue to support the Government efforts to strengthen its
capacity and improve delivery o f public services.
63.
Assuring a good mix o f instruments between programmatic support and investment
lending will be key to continuing to make efficient use o f Bank resources and sound
implementation o f the program during the CAS.
64.
The CAS consultations were broadly extensive and build on the PRSP participatory
process. This has helped to better align the CAS with the PRSP priorities. The Government also
held extensive consultations with a broad range o f stakeholders during the revision o f the PRSP.
Therefore, the consultation process for the next CAS should continue to build on PRSP
consultations, and focus on how IDA can best support the program o f actions set out in the newly
revised PRSP. Broader emphasis should also be put on adequate participation o f key stakeholders
during the implementation phase o f the CAS.
