EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Bolivia has undergone a period of profound change since the Government of President
Morales came to power in January 2006. The Morales administration has implemented an
array of economic and social policies to empower indigenous peoples and reduce poverty and
inequality. Macroeconomic results have been positive, with regular fiscal and current account
balances for the first time in decades, declining public debt and steady 4.5 percent annual growth
rates over the past seven years. A new Constitution was enacted in February 2009 and President
Morales was sworn in for a second term in January 2010.
The country faces numerous development challenges. Bolivia has one of the lowest GDP per
capita levels in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. Moderate poverty has declined
in recent years, but still afflicts nearly 60 percent of the population. Poverty is even higher in
rural areas, though the rate of improvement has been faster. Income inequality has also
decreased, but with a Gini index of 0.56 in 2007, Bolivia remains one of the most unequal
countries in LAC. Recent economic growth is vulnerable to shifts in international commodity
prices and total investment is low. Social indicators have improved since the 1990s but are still
well below levels in neighboring countries. And while much abated since the Government’s reelection, social and political tensions could return, especially if economic development slows.
The World Bank Group (WBG) and the Government have agreed on this four-year
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) as a viable medium-term program for addressing
upcoming development challenges. The conditions for the implementation of a CPS are in
place—a new constitutional framework, consolidated policy environment, sound macroeconomic
situation, good dialogue between the WBG and authorities and improved implementation
capacities—and the Government has requested Bank support through a medium-term strategy.
In May 2006 the Government launched its National Development Plan (NDP), which has
been updated for President Morales’ second administration. The NDP seeks to increase state
participation in strategic sectors, channel resources to labor-intensive sectors and develop
specific geographic areas; introduce new social programs while scaling up existing ones; ensure
greater country ownership of Bolivia’s development process and self-sufficiency in food and
energy production; and undertake a profound social and political reform through the new
Constitution. The updated Government Program for 2010-2015 has a strong focus on agricultural
transformation to reduce rural poverty and ensure food security, and improving infrastructure to
enhance development.
In light of Bolivia’s greater institutional and economic stability and in response to
Government requests, the WBG has developed this CPS around the NDP. After
implementing two consecutive Interim Strategy Notes (ISN), the situation in Bolivia now allows
for the preparation and implementation of a four-year strategy. This CPS takes into account
lessons learned from previous strategies and benefitted from a comprehensive consultation
process that informed the strategy’s selective approach. The CPS is designed around the
principles of: (i) alignment with Government priorities; (ii) selectivity and (iii) coordination with
development partners. A results matrix will track program implementation and its impact on
country development goals.
i

The CPS proposes a program of lending operations and knowledge activities in four
prioritized results areas: (i) sustainable productive development; (ii) climate change and
disaster risk management; (iii) human development and access to basic services; and (iv) public
sector effectiveness. These results areas respond to Government requests and the priorities
outlined in the NDP, and make the most of the WBG’s comparative advantage. The Bank will
also work to improve the execution of existing trust funds while searching for new ones to
achieve results in these areas.
Support to rural production and infrastructure will be an important focus of the CPS.
Several Bank operations will be geared towards helping rural producers sustainably improve
production and incomes. Infrastructure needs will also be addressed to benefit production and
national economic integration. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) will focus on exportoriented clients and fostering greater private sector activity, especially among job-creating small
and medium enterprises (SMEs). The CPS envisions further support to restore access to basic
infrastructure damaged by natural disasters, as well as assistance to help the country adapt to
climate change and integrate climate resilience into public policies.
Improving access to and the quality of social and basic services will play a major role in
meeting objectives, as will actions to strengthen the public sector. The Bank portfolio will
help improve the coverage and quality of health and education services, including maternal and
infant health, and employment programs for low-income youth. Expanding access to electricity,
water and sanitation services will also be a priority. The Bank will mainstream public sector
strengthening actions into all activities and seek to support the decentralization process. Further
assistance will help improve the availability and quality of data for decision-making.
The WBG’s portfolio will incorporate gender and governance and anti-corruption as crosscutting themes. All results areas have a gender focus, and most projects undertake participative
mechanisms to include the voices of women in project design and implementation. The WBG is
working closely with the authorities to advance the governance and anti-corruption agenda
through operations and technical assistance. All operations will incorporate transparency
mechanisms, capacity building measures and consultation processes to strengthen governance.
This four-year CPS period may involve a transition from the International Development
Association (IDA) to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).
The Government submitted a formal request to move to IBRD lending. This request will be
assessed at the CPS midpoint and IBRD lending would potentially be phased in after this point.
Up to the CPS midpoint review, Bolivia would only access IDA financing.
Political, economic and institutional issues pose risks to this CPS, but the WBG and
authorities are working to mitigate them. To mitigate political risks the WBG is targeting
activities with broad political support. Institutional risks are addressed by a deep program of
technical assistance in key areas as well as strengthening inclusive civil society oversight and
accountability mechanisms for WBG activities. Economic risks are foremost mitigated by the
Government’s ongoing sound macroeconomic management and by close monitoring and
technical assistance in areas such as debt management.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In the nearly six years since Mr. Evo Morales was elected as Bolivia’s first
indigenous president, the country has experienced significant socio-political and economic
change. Driven by high commodity prices and prudent fiscal and monetary policies, Bolivia’s
economy has had an annual average growth of 4.5 percent for the past seven years, increasing
per capita income by 18 percent. Current account surpluses have prevailed since 2003, and the
fiscal balance turned positive in 2006 for the first time in decades. Thanks to this positive
macroeconomic performance and debt relief, gross public debt dropped from 96 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2003 to 40 percent in 2010 while international reserves increased
from less than $1 billion to nearly $10 billion over the same time span. Deposits have tripled and
credits doubled in the last seven years while banks have strengthened their solvency and
liquidity. The national poverty rate in Bolivia declined slightly, from 63 percent in 2005 to 59
percent in 2008, but extreme rural poverty dropped 10 percentage points over the same time
period and income inequality has trended downward.
2.
Despite progress, Bolivia faces major development challenges. It has one of the lowest
GDP per capita levels in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region, moderate poverty
afflicts more than half of the population and income inequality is still very high. Recent
economic growth is vulnerable to shifts in international commodity prices and total investment is
low, limiting economic expansion. Productive enterprises in the rural sector—where one-third of
the population lives—remain hampered by inadequate infrastructure. Informality is high, which
translates into lower productivity and tax revenue. Public sector governance is weak, limiting
policy effectiveness and outcomes. Gender inequalities and social indicators, while much
improved since the 1990s, are still well below the levels of neighboring countries. And while
much abated since the Government’s re-election in December 2009, social and political tensions
could return to the fore, especially if economic development slows.
3.
This four-year World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS),
agreed upon with the Government, proposes a viable medium-term program for
addressing some of Bolivia’s challenges. During the consolidation of the reform process
initiated by the election of the Government of President Morales, the WBG has operated through
two consecutive Interim Strategy Notes (ISNs), following the recommendation from the 2005
Country Assistance Evaluation to use shorter-term strategies in the face of high uncertainty. Now
that the conditions for the implementation of a CPS are in place—a new constitutional
framework, consolidated policy environment, sound macroeconomic situation, good dialogue
between the WBG and authorities and improved implementation capacity—and the Government
has requested Bank support through a medium-term strategy.
II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA
A. Social and Political Context
4.
After years of political unrest, Evo Morales’ election in 2005 as the first president of
indigenous origin in Bolivia brought the country a period of institutional stability. In
December 2009 the Government called for early elections in which the ruling Movimiento al
Socialismo (MAS) obtained 64 percent of the vote, up from 54 percent attained in the 2005
1

elections. The Morales’ Government came into power for a second five-year term in January
2010. The proposed CPS is intended to cover the rest of the Morales second administration until
2015.
5.
A new Constitution was enacted in February 2009 and the legal framework for its
implementation is being developed. The Constitution establishes principles such as access to
public services as a fundamental right, an autonomous regime inclusive of indigenous
jurisdictions, increased state participation in the exploitation of natural resources and the
provision of basic public services. The National Assembly, in which the ruling Movimiento al
Socialismo (MAS) party has a two-thirds majority, has passed some of the laws required to
implement the new Constitution, including the reform of the electoral and judicial regimes and a
provisional autonomy framework. The pending legislative agenda includes other important
initiatives in areas such as labor, foreign investment, public enterprises, social oversight and
participation, land and forestry.
6.
Social demands and demonstrations have not ceased since the Government of
Morales came into power for a second term, but are now focused on specific claims for
improvement or changes in public policies, as is common in many LAC countries.
Previously, opposition to the administration came from more structured regional and political
sectors, mainly in the lowlands, but now protests come from organizations traditionally more
supportive of the Morales administration, such as indigenous people’s organizations, labor
unions and others. For example, following the Government’s December 2010 announcement to
eliminate fuel subsidies and increase fuel costs by an average of 83 percent, Bolivia experienced
nationwide street protests. Five days later the Morales administration reversed this decision,
arguing that “the Government had listened to the people”. This episode demonstrates that the
Government has realized that it needs to turn more to negotiation to create consensus among
affected groups to implement public policies.
7.
The Morales administration continues to argue that indigenous rights and
development opportunities for the rural poor are fundamental elements of the public
agenda. About two-thirds of the population identifies itself as indigenous. The indigenous
population in rural areas has traditionally suffered from high levels of poverty, limited economic,
social and political rights, marginalization and exclusion from public services. The new
Constitution recognizes all 36 indigenous languages as official, alongside with Spanish. Bolivia
is signatory to both the 1991 International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention, which
recognizes the territories, languages, communities and cultures of indigenous peoples, and the
2007 United Nations (UN) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
B. Poverty and Inequality Profile
8.
Bolivia has recorded declines in poverty and inequality during the past decade, but
levels remain among the highest in the LAC region. According to official figures, moderate
poverty declined from 66 percent in 2000 to 59 percent in 2008, while extreme poverty fell from
45 percent to 33 percent (Table 1). This decline is more noticeable in rural compared to urban
areas. A significant proportion of the poor are indigenous, though the gap has reduced
significantly in recent years. These figures, as well as more recent ones which report even further
declines in poverty rates, are subject to discussion due to lack of data comparability and other
2

methodological problems. Sustained economic growth and the introduction of some innovative
social programs give credence to the continuing decline of poverty in recent years, but statistics
need to be improved before valid inter-temporal comparisons are made. The Bank is working
with the Government to improve the reliability and comparability of poverty statistics.

Despite improvements, high levels of income inequality still persist in Bolivia.
Although the Gini index decreased from 0.62 in 2000 to 0.56 in 2007 (Table 2), this is still one
of the highest in the LAC region. Inequality is greater in rural areas, where the Gini stood at 0.64
compared to 0.51 in urban areas. A 2007 World Bank study on Poverty, Inequality and
Vulnerability showed that non-monetary indicators reinforce inequality. The dramatic disparities
in indicators between geographic regions, income groups and ethnic origin reflect the complex
social structure and history of the country.

10.
The Human Opportunity Index (HOI), a measure of equality of opportunities in
access to basic services for children and youth, shows improvements in most indicators for
1998-2008. A forthcoming World Bank HOI study for Bolivia shows that equitable access to
vaccination, nutrition, assisted birth delivery and primary and secondary enrollment have
improved significantly. However, equitable access to basic sanitation and adequate housing
infrastructure still show very low levels and modest advances. National-level HOI averages mask
important regional disparities. While departments like La Paz and Santa Cruz show leading
numbers in most indicators, others like Potosí, Chuquisaca, Beni and Pando tend to lag
significantly behind.
11.
Bolivia has made notable progress toward achieving some Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) but slow improvements in others, notably several health indicators. The
1

No data is available for the period after 2007. Data from more recent household surveys should help update these
figures.

Sixth MDG Progress Report produced by the Government’s Economic and Social Policy
Analysis Unit (Unidad de Análisis de Políticas Sociales y Económicas—UDAPE) concluded that
important advances occurred in some areas such as extreme poverty reduction, malnutrition and
gender equality, but that further efforts are needed if Bolivia is to reach the MDGs by 2015
(Table 3). Particular areas of concern include adolescent fertility, maternal and child mortality
ratios, prevalence of Chagas disease, AIDS and tuberculosis, primary school completion rates
and access to improved sanitation facilities.

C. Recent Economic Developments
12.
Bolivia’s economy has performed comparatively well during the past decade. A
favorable external environment and prudent macroeconomic policies have generated fiscal and
current account surpluses, a relatively robust financial system and increased international
4

reserves. This allowed Bolivia to confront the 2008-09 global crisis with good macroeconomic
fundamentals, which in combination with Bolivia’s relative isolation from international financial
markets helped the country get through the crisis in good shape. Bolivia had the strongest
performance in LAC in 2009, with GDP growing at 3.4 percent that year.
13.
Growth has been stimulated through large investments in the gas and mining
sectors in the late 1990s and early 2000s, combined with an improvement in the terms of
trade. GDP growth has averaged 4.5 percent annually over the last seven years, which has
translated into an 18.3 percent rise in per capita income. Mining output has almost doubled since
2006, due mostly to the foreign-financed San Cristóbal project, which began operations in 2007.
Households have benefited from higher export earnings, public investment and social transfers.
Furthermore, remittances have increased from US$170 million in 2003 to around US$1 billion in
the last three years, representing around 5 percent of GDP. Strong exports and dynamic domestic
demand have spurred other sectors including construction, manufacturing, finance, transport and
communications.
14.
The country has become more resilient, posting steady fiscal and current account
surpluses and declining public debt levels. Current account surpluses have prevailed since
2003, peaking at around 12 percent of GDP in 2006-2008 due to booming commodity prices and
growing mining export volumes (Table 4). The 2008 international crisis temporarily reduced
commodity prices and Brazilian gas demand, but the current account surplus nevertheless
remained at near 5 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010. International reserves increased from
US$976 million in 2003 to US$9.7 billion in 2010, equivalent to almost 20 months of imports.
The public sector maintained fiscal surpluses for five consecutive years due to higher gas
revenues and tax collections; public expenditure also increased but difficulties in further boosting
public investment helped maintain the surplus. These fiscal surpluses together with the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) diminished gross public debt from 96 percent of GDP
in 2003 to 40 percent in 2010. As a result, the 2011 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Article
IV Consultation for Bolivia concluded that the risk of debt distress is very low, with public and
external debt indicators below risky levels even in the worse stress test scenario. Over the past
few years, Fitch has upgraded Bolivia’s risk rating from B- with a negative outlook in 2005 to
B+ with a stable outlook in 2010, and S&P has upgraded Bolivia’s foreign currency long-term
debt rating from B- with a stable outlook in 2007 to B+ with a positive outlook in 2011.
15.
While inflation is under control, higher international food prices and natural
disasters have generated sporadic surges. Bolivia faced two inflation upsurges interrupted by
the global slowdowns—12-month inflation rose from 4.9 percent in December 2005 to 17.3
percent in June 2008 and from 0.3 percent in December 2009 to 11 percent in July 2011. Supply
issues were the main driver of the upsurges, but the Central Bank mopped up liquidity and
appreciated the exchange rate to control expectations and thus avoid second-round effects. The
Government has also implemented heterodox policies to control prices, including sales by public
agencies, export restrictions and price controls, with mixed results.
16.
The financial system is strong and expanding coverage. Banks are adequately
capitalized, return on equity and return on assets average 17 and 1.3 percent, liquidity is around
35 percent and provisions reach 177 percent of non-performing loans (NPLs). Due to
appreciation and measures to curb dollarization, dollar-denominated savings and credits dropped
5

to 40 and 33 percent respectively. NPLs decreased from 17 percent in 2005 to 1.9 percent in
August 2011, reflecting efforts to clean up their portfolios, sound credit evaluation standards and
the good economic context. Solid indicators are also reported for the large supervised non-bank
financial institutions, which currently account for 27 percent of the sector’s assets. Since 2007,
the financial system has expanded significantly, with deposits reaching 48 percent of GDP.
Credit surged 30 percent in the last year with a strong increase in smaller credits. Hitherto
unsupervised microfinance institutions are being brought under the supervision of the Financial
System Supervision Authority (Autoridad de Supervisión del Sistema Financiero—ASFI),
strengthening the overall financial system.
17.
Bolivia’s macroeconomic stance has improved, but significant challenges remain.
Industries such as mining, hydrocarbon and electricity production are operating at almost full
capacity, thus limiting new sources of growth unless significant investments take place. Despite
public investment levels around 10 percent of GDP, important infrastructure gaps and weak
institutional capacity hurts Bolivia’s development prospects. Challenges in health and education
limit the formation of human capital. Moreover, the country is highly dependent on commodity
exports, which represented about 82 percent of total exports and 32 percent of total revenues in
2010. A significant drop in commodity prices has current account and fiscal implications as well
as a deteriorating effect on growth.
18.
Bolivia’s private sector continues to face significant challenges that limit its
development. Challenges range from the country’s geographical isolation and heavy operating
costs, to burdensome red tape. Bolivia’s unequal income distribution and widespread poverty
restrict its domestic market. The Government has created and strengthened public enterprises in
several sectors including food, mining, manufacturing and banking. Nationalization of some
firms in the hydrocarbons, smelting, electricity, telecommunications, water and cement sectors
poses additional challenges, which might be compounded by ongoing reforms of the regulatory
framework. Both the World Bank Group’s Doing Business Report and the World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report recognize the difficulty of business entry, business
operations and the investment climate. Six out of every ten urban workers is employed in the
informal sector (about 75 percent of women and 60 percent of men)—one of the highest
informality levels in the world—constraining the development opportunities of micro and small
enterprises and overall economic growth. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and private sector
investment in Bolivia as percentages of GDP are both lower than the average for IDA countries
globally and for nearly all other IDA countries in LAC.

D. Economic Outlook
19.
External conditions improved during the first half of 2011 and gas export prices are
likely to drive continued strong macroeconomic results for the year. Higher commodity
prices and recovering gas export volumes to Brazil and Argentina favor Bolivian exports. The
current account surplus is expected to rise from 4.6 percent of GDP in 2010 to 6.8 percent in
2011, increasing international reserves to US$12.4 billion by the end of the year. The fiscal
surplus is expected to increase from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.7 percent in 2011 as
hydrocarbon revenues increase and the Government continues to encounter capacity difficulties
in increasing public investment. Growth should increase to 5 percent in 2011, boosted by internal
demand and gas export volumes and prices. Inflation is expected to fall to 7 percent this year as
food prices decrease and contractive monetary and exchange rate policies reduce demand
pressures.
20.
Growth faces additional challenges going forward. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales
Bolivianos (YPFB)—the state oil and gas company—has not been able to boost investment in the
sector. As a result, Bolivia’s gas production capacity has stagnated, delaying the expansion of
gas exports to Argentina and other markets. Neighbors are reducing their energy dependence on
Bolivia by developing their own reserves and building liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants. Due to
a methodological change in their calculation, Bolivia’s proven gas reserves fell to around 10
trillion cubic feet (TCF), down from the 27 TCF proven reserves measured in 2005. Mining
growth prospects are modest as San Cristóbal has already reached its maximum capacity and
further investments are delayed. Development of the Mutún iron ore reserve and the large
lithium reserves in Uyuni have been slower than planned due to the lack of energy supply,
insufficient transport infrastructure and lack of investment. Some labor-intensive sectors, in
particular manufacturing, could be constrained by the lack of private investment linked to the
overall business climate environment and uncertainties generated by ongoing legal reforms and
restrictions on energy supplies.
21.
As a result of these challenges and likely external conditions, growth is expected to
converge to 3.8 percent in the medium term. Private investment is expected to remain low at
around 7 percent of GDP, while commodity prices are expected to decrease, although modestly,
in the upcoming years. The current account surplus should decline to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2015
if mining and gas exports stagnate, remittances decline and imports are boosted by a robust
domestic demand and real appreciation. International reserves are expected to rise from US$13
billion in 2011 to US$18 billion in 2015. On the fiscal front, the surplus should gradually
decrease from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to near balance or a slight deficit in 2013-15,
assuming hydrocarbon revenues stagnate and expenditures continue growing. The central
government is also expected to run deficits and accumulate debt, but as a share of GDP gross
public debt is projected to decrease from 40 percent in 2010 to 37 percent in 2014 as nominal
GDP grows. This trend would be reversed by the end of the projection period due to emerging
fiscal deficit.
22.
Several downside risks exist to economic growth. A reversal in the international
recovery may negatively affect Bolivia’s prospects, eroding external and fiscal balances through
falling commodity prices, reduced gas volume exports to Brazil and Argentina and lower
remittances from Spain, the US and Argentina. Commodity exports represented about 82 percent
7

of total exports and 32 percent of total revenues in 2010, and a significant drop in commodity
prices has both current account and fiscal implications. If the Government succeeds in securing
partners to carry out announced investment projects, particularly in the mining and hydrocarbon
sectors, medium term growth prospects may improve significantly. On the other hand, high
international reserves may increase the pressure to spend or to consolidate a de facto fixed
exchange rate affecting the capacity to react to external shocks. The fiscal situation could also be
eroded by decentralization pressures and costs related to the nationalization process.
23.
Longer term growth obstacles need to be addressed in infrastructure, the financial
sector and the business environment. Important infrastructure gaps and weak institutional
capacity hurt Bolivia’s development prospects. With regard to the financial sector, the recent
surge in credit growth as well as the strong dependence on real estate as collateral will have to be
carefully monitored. Furthermore, the Government must balance measures to foster financial
inclusion, including the provision of loans through public entities and changes to the regulatory
framework, with the risk of over-indebtedness and a possible deterioration in the repayment
culture. The overall business environment is generally not conducive to large private sector
participation. As a result private investment and productivity are low, particularly in agriculture,
and informality rampant. Growth prospects are likely to thus remain limited until these important
challenges are addressed.

E. The National Development Plan and Government Priorities
24.
The ongoing National Development Plan (NDP) was designed during President
Morales’ first administration. In May 2006, the Government launched the NDP, built around
four pillars. Bolivia Productiva (Productive Bolivia) seeks to increase state participation in
strategic sectors—primarily natural resources and utilities—channel resources to labor-intensive
sectors and focus on developing specific geographic areas through financial and technical
support. Bolivia Digna (Dignified Bolivia) introduces new social programs and scales up
existing ones, such as redistributive transfers and safety nets, to fight poverty and exclusion.
Bolivia Soberana (Sovereign Bolivia) seeks greater country ownership of Bolivia’s development
process while eliminating external influences on policies, a strengthened status in international
forums through the maintenance of balanced relations with other countries and self-sufficiency in
food and energy production. Bolivia Democrática y Participativa (Democratic and Participatory
Bolivia) proposes a profound social and political reform through a new Constitution.
25.
During its second administration, the Government is placing renewed emphasis on
strategic areas of the NDP and has identified additional priorities. The proposed
Government Program for 2010-2015 was presented in December 2009 and is based on and
8

updates the NDP. Its goals are to boost economic growth through public investment, promote
productive development and improve infrastructure. In the social sectors, the Government
proposes to work towards reducing inequality, eradicating exclusion and ensuring the full
exercise of fundamental rights by increasing the coverage of public social services such as
health, education and housing. Finally, the program aims to ensure participation and social
oversight of public policies, and to gradually implement the new autonomy framework through
programmatic agreements between different levels of government.
26.
The NDP and sector strategies share the principles of the MDGs. The Bolivia
Productiva pillar is aligned with the goal of reducing poverty and extreme poverty by identifying
and implementing public policies that create opportunities for income generation. The Bolivia
Digna pillar defines social programs directed at improving human development and increasing
access to basic social services such as water and basic sanitation, education and health. Activities
under the Bolivia Digna pillar—several of which are supported by activities envisioned in this
CPS—will be especially important in addressing the health and education MDGs showing slow
progress toward the 2015 goals.
III. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP
A. Lessons Learned and Stakeholder Feedback
Past World Bank Experience
27.
Since 2004, the WBG has adopted three consecutive short-term strategies in a
context of high uncertainty. Given a volatile economic and social context, the WBG decided to
implement consecutive short timeframe strategies to provide flexibility to respond to the
country’s changing circumstances and needs. The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Bolivia covered the period FY04-05, and was followed by two ISNs covering FY07-09 and
FY10-11. A Completion Report that reviewed the Bank’s assistance to Bolivia for the fiscal
period 2004-2011 provides relevant lessons for the design and implementation of the new
strategy (Annex 2).
Lessons Learned
28.
Fragmentation of interventions into small operations is likely to increase transaction
costs for the Government and the Bank and limit their impact. Eight investment projects for
an average of US$18 million were approved under the first ISN in many different areas.
Although the lending program had been agreed upon with the Government, the simultaneous
preparation of these many programs have proved difficult to handle. Several months were needed
after project approval to reach readiness for implementation and to enter into effectiveness,
sometimes due to a lack of agreements in operational issues and approaches. The second ISN
was therefore more selective and only two key investment operations for a total of US$160
million were approved. The Bank worked closely with Government counterparts to foster
ownership for the projects and their implementation. Selectivity and larger projects have the
potential to yield greater development impacts as well as to contain transaction costs both for the
Bank and the Government.

9

29.
Anticipation and close attention to implementation challenges coupled with less
complex institutional arrangements can reduce delays in project execution. To avoid
cumbersome adjustments and amendment processes, institutional and implementation
arrangements have to be kept simple and flexible. Implementation needs to be accompanied by
close supervision and systematic capacity building activities. An unbiased, balanced and realistic
risk assessment is needed during the design and execution of the strategy as well as in the
implementation of individual operations to improve prospects for development effectiveness.
This is being addressed through tools such as the Operational Risk Assessment Framework
(ORAF).
Consultations
30.
The preparation of this CPS benefitted from consultations with a large and
representative sample of civil society, including women’s organizations. A total of about 300
people participated in nine consultation workshops, which provided spaces to discuss themes
linked to the strategic areas of the new CPS. Participants included representatives from women’s
indigenous and peasant organizations, the private sector, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), productive organizations, municipal councils, departmental assemblies, youth and
women’s groups and main donors active in Bolivia. Annex 3 describes the CPS consultation
process and results in more detail.
31.
The consultation process informed and validated the selective approach taken in the
preparation of the CPS. The process validated WBG efforts to strengthen interventions in rural
development and to continue work in urban areas with a strong gender focus. Feedback from
urban and rural women’s groups and among the rural poor strongly supported the overall
direction of planned CPS activities, and provided valuable perspectives that will inform project
interventions and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA). Based on the feedback received
from development partners, it was decided to intensify activities to assist the Government
improve implementation and fiduciary capacity at both the national and sub-national levels. This
is particularly important in view of the need to advance in the adoption of national systems.
B. Proposed World Bank Group Partnership Strategy
Principles of World Bank Group Engagement
32.
The proposed four-year CPS is designed around three principles: (i) alignment with
Government priorities; (ii) selectivity; and (iii) coordination with development partners.
These principles take into account lessons learned from previous strategies and feedback
received during consultations with the Government, civil society, private sector, and other
development partners, and is critical to achieving country ownership and effective development
results.
 Alignment with Government strategic priorities: The CPS is consistent with the goals
of the National Development Plan and is aligned with the pillars Bolivia Productiva, Bolivia
Democratica y Participativa and Bolivia Digna and the activities envisaged within the
Government Plan 2010-2015. Operations considered under the CPS target the areas in
which the Government has full ownership and sufficient implementation capacity, as
discussed with counterparts during CPS design.
10

 Selectivity: The Government and the WBG have identified areas in which the limited
IDA and IFC resources available and MIGA operations for Bolivia can achieve clear results.
The WBG has strengthened its engagement with Bolivia in recent years, and implementing a
CPS will permit the WBG to build on this partnership by moving to a more medium-term
outlook in areas of comparative advantage.
 Coordination with development partners: The WBG will continue to actively engage
in donor coordination mechanisms and undertake joint operation work when appropriate
notably with bilateral partners such as Brazil, Denmark, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland
and the UK and multilaterals such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and
the UN system. Consultation with other donors active in Bolivia informed proposed
portfolio design to avoid duplication of efforts and promote synergies with other ongoing
and future development projects.
33.
Building on these principles, the strategy will support a program of new lending
operations and knowledge activities in prioritized areas. The WBG’s program will
concentrate in four results areas: (i) sustainable productive development, (ii) climate change and
disaster risk management, (iii) human development and access to basic services, and (iv) public
sector effectiveness. Two cross cutting themes that will be mainstreamed in all Bank activities
under each of these results areas are: (i) gender and (ii) governance and anti-corruption. Results
areas and themes support Government initiatives under the NDP’s pillars of Bolivia Productiva,
Bolivia Digna and Bolivia Democrática y Participativa, and complement the priorities outlined
in the updated 2010-2015 Government Plan. The program will be initially financed through IDA
resources, with a possible transition to financing from IBRD to be considered at the midpoint of
the strategy.

This four-year CPS period may
involve a transition from IDA to IBRD.
Bolivia has been a blend country since FY01.
In 2006 its GNI per capita started to move
decisively above the IDA operational cut-off
(Figure 1). The Government submitted a
formal request to move to IBRD lending; this
request will be formally assessed at the CPS
midpoint. Until then, an indicative program
for FY12-14 of SDRs 159.9 million
(equivalent of US$ 257.2 million) under IDA
16 has been agreed upon with the
Government.

35.
Flexibility and simplified operation modalities are built into the CPS to reduce
implementation obstacles and accelerate execution. The strategy provides flexibility to adjust
the lending program if the situation merits, for instance to respond to shocks such as sudden
commodity price shifts or natural disasters. The Government and the Bank agreed to move the
pipeline towards fewer but larger operations in order to maximize the development impact while
containing transaction costs for both parties, in line with recommendations from portfolio
performance reviews and the 2005 Country Assistance Evaluation. In addition, greater attention
11

will be placed on implementation and institutional aspects, avoiding complex arrangements to
speed up execution.
36.
In tandem with the Bank’s approach, IFC will continue supporting Bolivia with a
strategy that focuses on viable, high-impact private sector-led projects complemented by
strategic advisory services On the investment side, IFC will maintain its focus on clients with
sustainable business models that have demonstrated strong past performance and operate
efficiently within regulatory frameworks mandated by Bolivia’s new Constitution. This includes
projects primarily in financial markets—small and medium enterprise (SME) banking,
microfinance and trade finance—agribusiness and forestry, but could also expand to other
sectors should a conducive environment be in place. As part of its advisory work, IFC will
continue its work to improve the investment climate by simplifying procedures at the municipal
and possibly national level, and provide training to SMEs through its business advisory pillar.
37.
The proposed strategy will also support the development of a flexible program of
AAA and convening services tailored to the Government’s needs. An indicative set of nonlending activities has been defined for FY12, but will be kept open and flexible for the other
years to ensure that the program can respond to the requirements that emerge during the
implementation of the CPS. A package of capacity building and knowledge activities would be
provided to prepare the country for the potential transition to IBRD financing in strategic areas
such as public debt management. To complement this work, IFC advisory services could provide
technical assistance and capacity building in investment climate, access to finance, and
strengthening local royalty management through strategic community investment programs
(Table 7).
Cross Cutting Theme 1: Gender
Main Challenges
38.
Bolivian women face multiple challenges, in particular unequal access to productive
and economic resources and high levels of poverty. Women continue to be mainly employed
in the informal sector, they face difficulties accessing credit and female wages are lower than
male ones for similar jobs, according to the 2008 World Bank study “Towards Gender Equity in
the Economy”. In the cities of El Alto and La Paz, as much as 70 percent of young mothers live
in poverty, and the majority of those who participate in the labor market are in the informal
sector. Informal labor often exposes young mothers and their children to accidents, violence,
abuse and abandonment. Despite gains following the 1996 Land Reform Act, cultural prejudices
still limit women’s access to land and property titling. Huge data gaps exist regarding poverty,
inequality and economic development among women that need to be filled in order to ensure that
gender equality policies can be effective. Preliminary findings from a Bank gender study
highlights the need to target information and training to rural women, considering their lower
education and the fact that domestic responsibilities restrict them from participating in
community capacity building.
39.
Gender indicators in Bolivia are mixed relative to LAC and other lower-middle
income countries. Bolivia has greater female labor force participation and political participation
than the average for the region and for lower-middle income countries (Figure 2). It does better
on average than lower-middle income countries in births attended by skilled health staff and in
12

the ratio of female to male secondary enrollment, but its performance is worse than the regional
average. The indicators reveal that more needs to be done to raise contraceptive prevalence and
lower adolescent fertility, where Bolivia lags.
40.
Violence
against
women
remains high and requires greater
attention. According to the 2008
National Demographic and Health
Survey (ENDSA), 38 percent of married
women reported having been victim of
psychological violence in the 12 months
prior to the survey and 24 percent
reported physical or sexual violence.

women equal status and protection. The new Constitution and sector legislation guarantee
equal rights and access to social services for men and women. Education enrollment and
completion rates are almost equal for girls and boys; recent policies aim to improve health and
nutrition services for pregnant women and small children. In 2008 the Government launched the
National Plan for the Equality of Opportunities, including policies to favor women in six broad
areas: (i) economic activity; (ii) education; (iii) health; (iv) violence; (v) institutional
strengthening and(vi) participation in decision-making. Women now represent almost half of the
ministerial cabinet, more than 40 percent of municipal councils and 36 percent of the Legislative
Assembly.
Areas of WBG Support
42.
Gender will be mainstreamed into the WBG’s portfolio guided by the Regional
Gender Action Plan FY12-FY14 (RGAP) and the findings of the World Development
Report (WDR) 2012. The LAC RGAP outlines a strategy for the Bank to work more effectively
to help client countries identify, understand and address gender issues that constrain
development. In line with the RGAP and WDR 2012, the Bank will determine strategic
engagements, attempt to assign resources within each new project to address gender issues, take
advantage of trust funds to promote a more gender sensitive program, document best practices on
gender mainstreaming and enhance gender monitoring and evaluation systems. The preparation
of this CPS benefitted from consultations with women’s organizations that validated the areas
identified and the gender approach taken. While a large portion of the current portfolio already
focuses on gender issues, further efforts will be made to ensure that engagement not only sees
women as beneficiaries, but also attempts to measure and address structural gender challenges.

13

43.
The ongoing and proposed portfolio on human development and access to basic
services incorporates a strong gender focus. The Expanding Access to Reduce Health
Inequalities APL III Project focuses on improving the health of mothers and children through
culturally-sensitive service provision, while the Investing in Children and Youth Project aims to
reduce chronic malnutrition in rural children through conditional cash transfer (CCT) to pregnant
women and mothers of children under two. The youth employment component provides an
additional financial incentive to promote the insertion of young mothers in the labor market.
Complementing this project, the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) trust fund will be
used to reduce childcare constraints for unemployed or precariously employed young mothers by
improving 149 existing childcare centers in El Alto and La Paz. The ongoing Urban
Infrastructure Project involves women throughout the preparation, implementation and decisionmaking stages, enabling the project to identify and address gender-based constraints and needs
(Box 1). Women’s economic and domestic activities are most affected by lack of basic services
such as electricity and water supply and sanitation. The proposed Water and Sanitation in Rural
Areas Project and Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural Transformation II Project are expected
to improve the living conditions of women.
44.
In collaboration with other donor agencies, the Bank will assist in addressing the
prevalence of violence against women. The Bank is a member of the Group of Partners for the
Development of Bolivia (GruS) gender subgroup, which is currently focusing on violence
against women. The Bank will continue participating in this group and will incorporate measures
to reduce violence against women into projects and other operations where it can. For example,
the Urban Infrastructure Project installed streetlights in marginal urban areas, which have
reduced the number of crimes against women.
Box 1: Urban Infrastructure, Component on Urban Upgrading in La Paz
In supporting Bolivia’s Barrios de Verdad project, Bank financing has helped to achieve
sustainable improvements in the urban infrastructure and living standards in some of the poorest
neighborhoods of La Paz. Living conditions have improved particularly for women and girls, as
their exposure to violence has reduced and their opportunities for equality increased:
 The installation of indoor sanitation facilities and street lighting improves pedestrian mobility
and women’s security.
 Childcare facilities, community and recreation centers enhance women’s economic
opportunities, allowing them to engage in productive activities outside the home.
 Ensuring that women have land titles and assets increases their social status and provides
them with access to formal banking systems.
45.
Emphasis will be placed on integrating gender into the sustainable productive
development and the climate change and disaster risk management areas to improve equal
access to productive and economic resources. The Community Investment in Rural Areas
Project has a strong gender focus, separating resources for investments identified by women.
The Land for Agricultural Development Project has also been gender targeted. The Bank is
making use of a Gender Action Plan (GAP) trust fund to gather gender information and generate
new knowledge on gender roles in rural Bolivia to guide the inclusion of gender in both the
climate change and disaster risk management and the sustainable productive development areas
14

of the CPS. Wherever feasible, IFC investment and advisory projects will also seek to actively
include and benefit women, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas.
46.
The Bank will assist the Government in addressing the lack of gender-specific data.
Through the census and household surveys in the Strengthening Statistical Capacity and the
Informational Base for Evidence-Based Planning Project (STATCAP), accurate up-to-date
information will become available, allowing for sex-disaggregated data. This will serve to better
target public policies to address gender inequalities and assess their impact on the well being of
women.

quality (Figure 3). In addition, the 2010-2011 Global Competitiveness Report ranks Bolivia’s
judicial independence 129th out of 139.
Government Strategy
48.
Various initiatives exist to promote better governance and to fight corruption. The
2009 Constitution establishes key principles with respect to transparency, access to information
and anti-corruption measures. As a result, the Ministry of Institutional Transparency and Fight
against Corruption was created, a national policy on transparency and anti-corruption was
approved and the Law to Fight Corruption, Illegal Enrichment and Fortune Investigation was
passed. This law includes heavy penalties for corrupt contractors and civil servants, reinforces
the already mandatory declaration of assets for all public officials and establishes retroactivity
for corruption cases.
Areas of WBG Support
49.
The WBG is working closely with authorities to help move forward the ambitious
governance, transparency and anti-corruption agenda. The Bank is continuing to assist
Bolivia’s efforts against corruption under the Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) initiative, a
cooperation begun in 2009 with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) (Box
2). The Government has expressed interest in reforming the national procurement system, and
15

the Bank has indicated its willingness to undertake joint technical assistance with the IADB to
develop and implement a national procurement strategy. Technical assistance is being considered
for the institutional framework for tackling corruption, including the Ministry of Institutional
Transparency and Fight against Corruption.
50.
Bolivian authorities have shown a commitment toward greater transparency and
social oversight to reduce corruption and improve governance, and the WBG is supporting
this agenda throughout its activities. All projects under the proposed CPS will include
transparency mechanisms and institutional strengthening measures, and will assess incorporating
a strategy for corruption risk mitigation. The Bank has begun using social oversight
mechanisms—including in the Urban Infrastructure Project and the Participatory Rural
Investment II Project—and will scale up these practices to encourage accountability and
transparency. Furthermore, the Government has expressed interest in participating in the Open
Data Initiative and the WBG Access to Information Policy. The WBG is also following the
Government’s lead regarding greater access to information for civil society. Not only is the
WBG making more project information available, but it is actively seeking new ways to
disseminate information via traditional and new media and participation in public events.
Box 2: Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR)
StAR is a partnership between UNODC and the World Bank providing technical assistance for
international asset recovery. Bolivia requested StAR assistance in 2009. With StAR support, an
inter-institutional working group (GIRA) was created to coordinate the identification,
investigation and prosecution of cases. Bolivia has also requested financing for projects related
to witness protection legislation and in the verification of asset disclosures.
The witness protection program is managed by UNODC. The asset disclosure program is
followed by the Bank and has two components: (i) prioritizing asset disclosures to be verified,
and (ii) launching a pilot program for verification. Both components are already in advanced
stages. On the Bank side, Financial Market Integrity (FPDFI) and Transparency and
Accountability (FPDTA) are the main providers of StAR assistance.
Results Area 1: Sustainable Productive Development
Main Challenges
51.
One of Bolivia’s key development challenges continues to be generating dynamic
economic activity to address the country’s high rates of poverty, especially in rural and
peri-urban areas. As stated in the WDR 2008, the agricultural sector is essential to growth,
poverty reduction and food security. However, agriculture yields in Bolivia are substantially
lower than in its neighboring countries, partially due to inferior technology, weak institutions
dealing with agricultural innovation and limited irrigation areas. Income generation for rural
producers, in particular women, is often constrained by limited access to land, insufficient
market integration and difficult access to consumption markets. Despite recent advances, the
incidence of moderate and extreme poverty in rural areas—especially among women—continues
well above the already high national average. Public investment in rural development is still
insufficient when compared to the needs of the sector.

16

52.
Addressing infrastructure needs and promoting economic integration is critical for
Bolivia’s development. Despite progress during the last decade, huge infrastructure gaps
remain, in particular in transport and productive infrastructure at the decentralized and
community levels. Precarious national and rural roads limit access to markets and constrain
productive development. In addition to being a landlocked country, Bolivia’s difficult
topographical and geological conditions make infrastructure development expensive and
challenging. Airports have limited facilities and lack basic safety and security equipment,
impeding regional development and touristic activity. Poor rural communities lack basic
infrastructure which, compounded by a lack of coordination among different government levels,
constrains the provision of productive services such as irrigation.
53.
The country’s labor-intensive SME sector requires development support, in
particular access to finance. SMEs represent over 90 percent of total enterprises in Bolivia,
employing around 70 percent of the labor force. However, their productivity is very low—in
particular for those firms managed by women—and they face severe obstacles to development,
including low access to productive credit, a heavy regulatory and tax burden and insufficient
vertical and horizontal integration. These limitations reduce the growth potential of the country
as a whole.
Government Strategy
54.
The Government has laid out a wide-ranging strategy for generating more
productive opportunities in the Bolivia Productiva pillar of the NDP, with a strong
emphasis on rural development and the SME sector. The plan proposes agriculture
transformation to reduce rural poverty and ensure food security, improving distribution of and
access to land, improving farmers’ access to markets and providing better productive equipment
and infrastructure. This transformation envisions improving innovation systems to spur
agricultural productivity and the sustainability of small farmers. The Government also highlights
that local productive equipment and infrastructure is key for improving agricultural productivity,
requiring coordination with and the participation of sub-national governorates as well as
communities and producer organizations.
55.
One of the key goals of Bolivia Productiva is developing transport infrastructure.
The Government believes that the country requires better transport links to enhance the
development of regions outside the main road axis and in specific productive sectors, including
agriculture, mining and tourism. The Government plans to improve or build several roads to
improve integration with neighboring countries and offer greater export opportunities to isolated
regions, such as the northern region of La Paz where it is promoting an agro-industrial complex.
The Government also intends to build or upgrade several airports to promote economic activities.
56.
The development of productive SMEs is critical in the NDP’s efforts to diversify the
economy and boost employment. The Government aims to provide comprehensive support to
labor-intensive sectors, in particular SMEs. The Government implemented the second-tier
Productive Development Bank to provide low interest credit to producers in prioritized sectors
that have limited access to other financial sources. It is also building an institutional development
framework to improve small producers’ access to local and foreign markets, provide them with

17

technical assistance and training, promote productive clusters and lift other constrains for
growth.
Areas of WBG Support
57.
Responding to pressing development needs and Government objectives, the WBG
will support upgrading sustainable agricultural productivity. The Bank will continue
assistance to the agricultural sector through the ongoing Rural Alliances Project and the
proposed Rural Alliances II Project, which promote access to markets. The recently approved
Agricultural Innovation and Services Project is expected to contribute to the availability of
improved technologies and other innovations and enhance productivity growth, food security and
the income-earning potential of Bolivian families dependent on agriculture and forestry. The
Land for Agricultural Development Project will continue promoting land access for small
farmers, with a special focus on women. The Participatory Rural Investment II Project enhances
productivity through the provision of technical assistance accompanied by local infrastructure
investments. The proposed Integrated Community-Driven Territorial Development for Remote
Communities in the Amazon trust fund will promote environmentally sustainable land use
planning and production, working specifically with women’s organizations.
58.
The IFC will finance private initiatives in sustainable agribusiness and forestry. In
the agribusiness sector, IFC expects to remain focused on export-oriented clients able to add
value to locally produced raw materials as well as generate or preserve jobs in rural areas in a
sustainable manner. It also hopes to extend its agribusiness activities into new areas such as
forestry and begin working with new partners such as cooperatives and indigenous groups on
projects that are both environmentally and economically sustainable, as is the case with the
Empresa Forestal SLV operation approved in FY11. In addition, IFC is backing a regional
Responsive Soy program to improve crop productivity and the sales of small and medium
soybean farmers, and promoting the adoption of environmental and social standards to increase
the acreage of sustainably managed land.
59.
The WBG will continue to promote the economic integration of the country through
the provision of transportation infrastructure. The Bank will support the development of
northern Bolivia through the ongoing National Roads and Airport Infrastructure Project, which
will improve the year-round transit on the San Buenaventura-Ixiamas national road and the
safety and reliability of the Rurrenabaque Airport. The airport renovation will allow economic
expansion by facilitating access for higher-income tourism and ecotourism. IFC will be attentive
to opportunities for private sector participation in infrastructure projects under a conducive
regulatory framework. This includes potential opportunities in public private partnership (PPP)
operations on both the investment and structuring side, should there be a demand from the public
and private sectors for such support.
60.
During the CPS timeframe, improving access to productive infrastructure in rural
areas will be a priority. The Bank is bolstering access to sustainable basic infrastructure and
services through the recently approved Community Investments in Rural Areas Project through
which empowered rural communities will identify, prepare, implement and maintain small
development sub-projects that respond to their priority needs; providing special attention and
priority to projects benefiting women. The Participatory Rural Investment II Project is scaling
18

up institutional arrangements between national, departmental and municipal governments and
civil society for the sustainable management of sub-national public investment in selected
productive sectors. In addition, the Lake Titicaca Local Sustainable Development Project
supports the provision of tourism infrastructure.
61.
The WBG will foster greater private sector activity, especially among job-creating
SMEs. The IFC stands ready to widen the range of advisory services it provides to clients in
Bolivia, such as continuing deployment of its Business Edge SME training program and business
licensing/permit simplification at the sub-national level. Should the opportunity arise, IFC could
provide technical assistance as well as investment support for mining and other extractive
industries activities. Critical areas of support could be environmental and social aspects as well
as revenue management related to royalties and taxes. To promote access to credit, IFC expects
to continue focusing on opportunities for SME lending and risk management with banks, and
fostering further innovation in Bolivia's microfinance sector. The Bank is providing advice on
access to finance for SMEs through the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) jointly
prepared with the IMF, and the Financial Sector Review. The Bank remains open to include
future activities geared toward SME promotion and development.
62.
MIGA has recently received preliminary inquiries by investors and will proceed
once a strong developmental case can be built and efforts are judged to be complementary
to broader WBG engagement. At present MIGA has no outstanding contract of guarantees in
Bolivia. The latest contract in Bolivia covered an equity investment by the Banco de Crédito del
Peru into its subsidiary in Bolivia; it expired in FY10 at the termination of the contract. MIGA
has received preliminary inquiries by investors with interests in the financial, infrastructure and
oil and gas sectors in Bolivia. These inquiries are still at a very early stage and the financing
arrangements are not yet in place. After years of little activity and many institutional changes in
the country, there is a need to reach out and explain how MIGA can support Bolivia.
Results Area 2: Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management
Main Challenges
63.
Improving the capacity for disaster risk management and promoting adaptation to
climate change are critical challenges for Bolivia. The country is highly vulnerable to natural
disasters and climate change phenomena such as floods, droughts and glacier retreat, which in
turn affect water supply, water management, irrigation systems, hydropower generation and
transportation infrastructure. The impacts on sustainable productive development as well as on
living conditions for both rural and urban poor can be considerable, as La Niña and El Niño
weather events have demonstrated. Improving sustainable land and water resource management
as well as reducing pollution should complement climate change adaptation efforts to ensure
long-term impact.
Government Strategy
64.
The Government has taken an active role in addressing the risks inherent in
Bolivia’s vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change. Sector plans on risk
management are in place in agriculture and water and health, among others, as well as
contingency plans for events such as droughts, flooding and fires. The Government is currently
19

working on a National Program for Risk Management that will identify strategies and actions to
mitigate impacts of and respond to natural disasters. Sector programs under the framework of the
National Mechanism for the Adaptation to Climate Change promote actions for climate change
adaptation and develop capacities to mitigate risks associated with climate change. Watershed
management has been identified as a way to introduce a multi-sector climate change approach at
the local and regional level.
Areas of WBG Support
65.
The Bank is supporting natural disaster and climate change management with a
mix of project lending, trust fund interventions and AAA. During the CPS period, the
ongoing Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project will continue restoring access
to basic infrastructure damaged by El Niño and La Niña phenomena, and strengthening the
Government’s ability to respond to natural disasters. The Bank will continue assisting Bolivia’s
efforts to adapt to climate change in prioritized sectors through mechanisms such as the two
phases of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR), which are expected to play a
strategic role in integrating climate resilience at different levels of governance mainly in the
water sector and disaster risk management (Box 3). The program will be gender-informed and
emphasize the collection of gender-disaggregated data. The ongoing trust fund on Rapid Glacier
Retreat in the Tropical Andes (PRAA), funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and
other donors, is expected to provide important inputs to the PPCR. In coordination with the
Government, the Bank will continue looking for trust fund opportunities to strengthen the CPS in
these areas. Financed by the GAP trust fund, a forthcoming gender study investigating the
changing gender role in natural resource management and gender-differentiated vulnerabilities to
climate change is being finalized. Currently the Bank is implementing the Strengthening
Environmental Management and Institutions NLTA to generate knowledge in the areas of
mining pollution in watersheds, solid waste management and environmental health. The
Reducing Risk for Biodiversity Conservation Using Adaptive Fire Management, financed by the
Development Marketplace (2009), aims to reduce forest fires in a climate change context.
Box 3: The Pilot Program on Climate Resilience (PPCR) in Bolivia
The PPCR pilots ways to integrate climate risk and resilience into development planning. Funded
and managed by the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), it is operated jointly by the Bank and
IADB and has two phases. Phase I aims to strengthen climate information systems, to
mainstream climate change resilience in public sector management and to prepare a climate
resilient investment program for Phase II.
Phase II will address climate change through a participative and integrated approach to river
basin management and will include two investment projects: (i) climate resilience of urban water
supply in La Paz and El Alto; and (ii) climate resilience in the Rio Grande Watershed. Technical
assistance will also further strengthen Government capacities to pursue climate-resilient
development and to extend the lessons from the PPCR to other investments, mainly through the
improvement of the national planning and investment systems.

Results Area 3: Human Development and Access to Basic Services
Main Challenges
66.
As one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, Bolivia faces tremendous human
development deficits, due in part to the limited access to social services and safety nets.
Child and maternal mortality rates as well as adolescent fertility rates are high in comparison to
other countries in the LAC region and to other lower-middle income countries and disparities in
health outcomes between rural and urban areas and between different income groups remain
significant. Chronic malnutrition affects one out of five children under three nationally and one
out of three children in rural areas (2008). Bolivia has high net primary enrollment rates, but
completion rates are low. Secondary education is characterized by low enrollment and high
repetition and dropout rates, due largely to the opportunity cost of schooling and supply
shortages. Generations of young have migrated to urban and peri-urban areas in the pursuit of
better opportunities for income generation. However, the open unemployment rate for youth 1524 years old was almost 12 percent in 2007, three times that of the general population. More than
90 percent of the young are employed in the informal sector. The process of urbanization has
also been accompanied by the disintegration of informal safety nets and the emergence of
problems such as the abandonment of children.

leaving communities in considerable
isolation. Although coverage of rural basic services and infrastructure has increased significantly
in recent years, it remains low due in part to high costs. Only half of the population in rural areas
has access to water and 37 percent to improved sanitation services (Figure 4). The rapid
urbanization process of the last two decades has generated additional challenges. As cities grow,
the cost of meeting basic needs increases and cities struggle to meet service demands, especially
in marginal peri-urban areas where the majority of poor urban dwellers live.
Government Strategy
68.
The Government has demonstrated a strong commitment to improve access to social
services such as health, education and youth employment programs. The Government
proposes a universal health care insurance system and a comprehensive plan of medical
21

infrastructure and equipment. Special attention will be placed on promoting the use of health
services by mothers and children in rural and indigenous areas. The ongoing CCT Bono Juana
Azurduy promotes the use of health services by pregnant women and children under two to
reduce chronic malnutrition and infant and maternal mortality. In terms of education, the
Government is working towards expanding coverage and improving the quality of service.
Additional reforms call for universal and free education and day care, giving prominence to early
childhood development. In youth employment, the Government seeks to facilitate the insertion of
young workers into the labor market.
69.
The expansion of basic services, such as electricity, water and sanitation, is seen as a
basic human right. In terms of energy, the Government proposes to increase the coverage of
electricity in rural areas and peri-urban areas through the use of renewable energy sources. For
water and sanitation, the Government’s priority is to expand rural and peri-urban coverage for
consumption and irrigation. The National Plan for Basic Sanitation 2009-2015 seeks to extend
the provision of sustainable services and strengthen public, cooperative and community service
providers. The Government’s goal is to increase the coverage of drinking water services to 90
percent and sanitation services to 80 percent by 2015.
Areas of WBG Support
70.
The Bank will continue supporting improved access to and quality of health
services. The ongoing Expanding Access to Reduce Health Inequalities Project aims at
enhancing maternal and infant health in targeted areas so that the current gaps between regions
and chronic malnutrition among children under two years of age are reduced and health
insurance coverage is increased. The Investing in Children and Youth Project is reinforcing the
objectives of reducing chronic malnutrition and improving women’s health during pregnancy in
rural areas by supporting the implementation of the Bono Juana Azurduy CCT.
71.
The Bank will also provide assistance to the education sector as well as to the youth
employment generation policies and childcare initiatives. The ongoing Secondary Education
Transformation Project is designed to help increase access to quality primary and secondary
education in La Paz. The Investing in Children and Youth Project has a component supporting
Mi Primer Empleo Digno, which is improving the employability of low-income youth via
vocational in-class training session and internships in private sector firms. This program
encourages the participation of young mothers by providing a greater stipend. A proposed
operation under the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) will pilot culturally appropriate
early childcare in vulnerable urban municipalities. At the Government’s request, the Bank will
continue providing technical assistance related to its social protection initiatives through the
ongoing programmatic Social Safety Net NLTA and the proposed Social Protection Beneficiaries
Registry NLTA. Possible technical assistance in education is also being discussed.
72.
A human development project has been programmed to respond to emerging needs
in this area. The Government has requested that the Bank maintain flexibility to respond to
emerging needs in the human development sector. As such, the CPS is proposing a human
development project that will be defined in the future.

22

73.
Expanding access to basic services will continue to be a priority. In electricity, the
GPOBA on Decentralized Electricity for Universal Access is financing the installation of solar
power in rural areas and the proposed Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural Transformation II
will expand sustainable rural electricity coverage with diversified options, primarily through
renewable energy. The ongoing Lake Titicaca Local Sustainable Development Project and the
Community Investments in Rural Areas Project will help expand water and basic sanitation
services. The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) will continue providing technical assistance
and building capacity in key institutions to enhance the sustainability of investments in both
urban and rural areas. In addition, the Government has requested the Bank’s assistance in
developing a new water and sanitation project to improve coverage in rural or peri-urban areas.
Building on the successful experience of the Urban Infrastructure Project, the CPS proposes the
Urban Infrastructure II Project to continue urban upgrading, enhanced mobility and expanded
sewerage coverage in urban areas. All of these operations are expected to have an important
effect on the well-being of women, since they bear most of the burden caused by the lack of
basic services.
Results Area 4: Public Sector Effectiveness
Main Challenges
74.
A key obstacle to development and poverty reduction in Bolivia is the limited
effectiveness of the public sector. The lack of a clear legal framework based on the new
Constitution makes coordination among different government levels difficult, creating
disagreements over responsibilities and hampering the design and implementation of public
policies, especially at the sub-national level. Capacity gaps constrain the central government’s
ability to manage public policies. Another key obstacle is the limited amount of timely, reliable
data with which to design policies and measure results. The last Population and Housing Census
was carried out in 2001 and the last Agriculture Census in 1984 and household surveys are not
representative at the departmental level or in the main cities. These challenges create particular
difficulties when trying to implement programs to address the complex problems of
multidimensional welfare, for example gender, rural development or adaptation to climate
change.
Government Strategy
75.
The Government’s objective for this results area is to improve public sector
efficiency. In July 2010 the Legislative Assembly passed the Law of Autonomies to enhance
governability by increasing participation and decision-making at the local level. The involvement
of the affected communities in the design, implementation and oversight of programs and
projects is a key aspect of the NDP’s Bolivia Democrática y Participativa pillar, and is being
mainstreamed throughout public sector interventions. The Government intends to pass legislation
to address contentious issues such as the distribution of fiscal resources and other problems
created when sub-national legal regulations do not concur with the Constitution, and how
indigenous statutes will be approved and implemented. Aware of the importance of reliable data
for public policy, the Government has decided to undertake two censuses and strengthen
collection techniques and analysis methodologies.

Areas of WBG Support
76.
The WBG will continue supporting Bolivia’s decentralization process. The ongoing
Participatory Rural Investment II Project calls for developing strategies and tools for the
adequate implementation of the law as well as public policies to improve institutional and fiscal
decentralization in the short, medium and long term. The Bank will also assist the
implementation of autonomies through the ongoing programmatic Public Sector Governance
NLTA that addresses a specific Government request on decentralized public investment.
Additionally, some sub-national authorities have requested a Sub-National Public Expenditure
and Financial Assessment (PEFA) to assess the financial management at the regional and
municipal level. The Bank is also supporting the Government’s efforts to bring a more
participatory approach to development through community involvement in several current
projects such as the Urban Infrastructure Project and the Community Investments in Rural
Areas.
77.
The Bank will continue providing technical assistance for key issues requested by
the Government to strengthen management. Non-lending technical assistance will play a
major role in the Bank’s relations with Bolivia, addressing capacity constraints that limit policy
and program effectiveness. The Bank and Government are discussing possible technical
assistance to address the lack of an independent procurement agency, with a view to maximizing
the efficient use of limited fiscal resources. The proposed Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) in Auditing and Accounting will provide the Government and
other interested parties with a comprehensive analysis of accounting and auditing standards in
the public and private sectors. Through the StAR initiative, the international community has
provided training to the Ministry of Transparency to increase its capacity in verifying assets
declarations and recovering stolen assets hidden abroad.
78.
The informational base for a monitoring and evaluation system will be improved.
The STATCAP Project is helping prepare the forthcoming Population and Housing Census and
Agriculture Census as well as improving household surveys. These tools will provide critical
data to guide decision-making on a wide array of public policies, including the allocation of
resources to sub-national governments to more effectively implement new autonomy legislation.
Complementing this activity, the proposed Ensuring Quality in the National Statistical System of
Bolivia trust fund will help build capacity in the National Statistics Institute. Furthermore, the
ongoing programmatic Multidimensional Poverty and the proposed Poverty Map Update and
Poverty Assessment will provide a set of tools to better understand poverty and design public
policies.
C. Implementing the Partnership Strategy
Financial Envelope
79.
The IDA16 indicative allocation for Bolivia is Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 159.9
million for FY12-14. In accordance with IDA’s Performance-Based Allocation system,
Bolivia’s indicative allocation for the FY12-14 period is SDR153.1 million in credits (equivalent
to approximately US$246.3 million) and SDR6.8 million in hard term credits (equivalent to
25

approximately US$10.9 million). Two operations for US$79 million originally envisaged under
the previous ISN have been approved under IDA 16. The allocation for FY12 is SDR56.5
million (SDR2.6 million in hard terms), while the amounts for FY13 and FY14, SDR55.7 million
(SDR2.4 million in hard terms) and SDR47.7 million (SDR6.8 million in hard terms)
respectively, are indicative.2 The CPS proposes a frontloading of IDA resources in FY12 and
FY13 in order to ensure continuity of ongoing projects that close during the first and second year
of the CPS. This would be done in accordance with the implementation guidelines of the IDA16
Resource Allocation Framework.
80.
IBRD lending to Bolivia may be envisaged after the midpoint of the CPS timeframe.
Up to the CPS midpoint review, Bolivia would only access IDA financing. IBRD lending would
be considered after the midpoint of the CPS timeframe and its phasing in would depend on: (i)
the continuation of a sound macroeconomic environment, building on recent progress in this
area, and (ii) progress in improving the investment climate as evidenced by an increase in private
investment including increasing FDI inflows in connection to the large planned extractive
industry projects that underpin growth under the Government’s medium term macroeconomic
framework. Potential lending volumes may be determined at the midpoint of the CPS and will
depend on IBRD’s lending capacity and demand from other borrowers.
Managing Program Implementation
81.
The current portfolio comprises 13 investment projects for a total of US$444
million, of which US$354 million remains undisbursed. Four projects, constituting a total of
US$238 million, have been approved in calendar year 2011 and will soon start implementation,
while three operations are expected to exit the portfolio in FY12. In addition, a recipientexecuted trust fund in renewable energy for US$5.2 million is expected to close in FY13. Eight
trust funds for US$3.57 million were approved in FY11, two of them recipient-executed and the
remaining Bank-executed. The approval and execution of grants will require particular attention,
given the country’s poor record in the implementation of recipient-executed trust funds.
82.
The execution and quality of the portfolio have shown important improvements in
recent years. The Bank will continue to work with the Government to consolidate these gains in
portfolio performance. The disbursement ratio reached 23 percent in FY11, a significant increase
compared to the 12 percent reached in FY08 and FY09. The percentage of projects at risk
decreased from 45 in FY09-10 to 27 in FY11 and the realism index reached 100 percent. The
Bank is working to improve the pro-activity index, currently at 50 percent and to support projects
with implementation delays or those at risk of not achieving their development objectives
(currently around one-third of the portfolio).

2

Actual allocations will depend on: (i) Bolivia’s performance; (ii) its performance relative to that of other IDA
recipients; (iii) the amount of overall IDA resources; (iv) changes in the list of active IDA-eligible countries; (v)
terms of financial assistance provided (grants or loans); and (vi) the amount of compensatory resources received for
MDRI. Since Bolivia’s per capita gross national income (GNI) has remained above the IDA operational cut off for
more than three consecutive years, new terms will now apply for credits effective FY12. These will have a maturity
of 25 years, with a five-year period of grace and a 1.25 percent per annum interest rate. For hard term credits the
lending terms are 25 years of maturity with a five-year period of grace and an interest rate based on the IBRD fixed
rate equivalent minus 200 basis points. In addition to the IDA16 indicative allocation, the MDRI will continue
providing a notional equivalent of US$40 million per year in budget support.

26

83.
The Bank and the Government have been carrying out bi-annual Country Portfolio
Performance Reviews (CPPRs) to address systemic issues affecting the pipeline and active
portfolio, as well as project-specific issues. This exercise has proved successful in reaching
clear agreements on milestones for projects under preparation. It has also helped to identify
actions aimed at removing obstacles impeding smooth project execution. Frequent meetings with
the Minister of Development Planning and officials from the Vice Ministry of Public Investment
and External Financing also take place to further support implementation. During the CPS
period, the Bank and the Government will continue these detailed revisions on a bi-annual basis
or even increase the frequency if the situation calls for greater attention.
84.
Greater attention to implementation and institutional capacity as well as to the
adequate assessment of risks is required to maintain project execution and improve
development effectiveness. Close supervision is critical in a context of generally weak technical
capacity and institutional changes in Government counterparts. Capacity building has not always
been sustainable given the high levels of staff turnover in executing entities. Thus, technical and
fiduciary teams need to continue providing day-to-day guidance to counterparts. Early and
complete assessments of risks and identification of mitigation measures are also required to
promote a smooth implementation. Tools such as the ORAF are helping to address these
challenges. Improvements are taking place, as evidenced by portfolio indicators such as the
increase in the disbursement ratio, the drop in the percentage of projects at risk and a recent
Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) review of the country portfolio, but there is still
much room to improve development effectiveness.
Fiduciary Aspects and Use of Country Systems
85.
Important steps have been taken towards strengthening public financial
management (PFM) systems in Bolivia, though some weaknesses persist. In 2009 the Bank
and IADB jointly carried out a PFM assessment following the PEFA framework. The assessment
showed that important steps have been taken towards enhancing PFM systems in Bolivia, mainly
in relation to expanding the integrated financial management system (SIGMA) both at the central
and sub-national level, implementing a well-functioning Treasury Single Account, and
improving treasury-related functions including debt management. However, budget formulation
and execution still have weaknesses related to internal control and audit functions as well as
limited legislative scrutiny over budget bills. Following the PEFA results, the Government
designed an action plan, which in its first stage is focusing on enhancing revenue-generating
functions (customs and taxation offices).
86.
The Bank will continue to increase its reliance on country systems. The steps taken
by the Government to upgrade PFM systems have allowed the Bank to increase reliance on
country systems, and the current portfolio relies widely on existing arrangements related to
budgeting, accounting, internal processes and procedures through the use of SIGMA and
Treasury Single Account for fund flow arrangements. Those arrangements are strengthened or
supplemented only when the nature of a project calls for it, mainly in relation to financial
reporting and auditing. During the current CPS program, the Bank will continue seeking
opportunities to deepen the use of country systems, agreeing on certain strengthening measures
at the institutional or sector level. Given the importance of good quality financial reporting, an
accounting and auditing ROSC will be carried out as part of the current strategy. In terms of
27

procurement, the Government intends to push a reform of the national procurement system. If
there is interest, the Bank will continue working with the IADB in supporting the application of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Development Assistance
Committee (OECD-DAC) methodology for assessing the quality and effectiveness of the
procurement system and in developing and implementing a national procurement strategy.
Results Orientation and Monitoring
87.
A results matrix will track the implementation of the Bank’s program and its
impact on country development goals. Most of the results will be delivered from projects
under implementation. Thus, the results matrix (Annex 1) is largely composed of ongoing
projects for which impact indicators should be available by the end of the proposed strategy.
New operations will span beyond the CPS period and their final outcomes will materialize in the
future. However, their expected outcomes have been included in the results matrix. The matrix is
organized around the results areas of the proposed program and is mainly based on the results
framework of each individual operation, including a strengthened focus on gender. The
Government’s NDP establishes the vision and strategic orientation for achieving the country’s
development objectives, but specifies few development outcomes and indicators. Therefore,
higher-level results were taken from the Government’s intention to achieve the MDGs and sector
strategies. The matrix also includes the expected outcomes of the most relevant trust funds. The
results framework will be updated in the CPS Progress Report to reflect progress in achieving
goals and to incorporate the results proposed by the operations that will be approved in the next
two years.
88.
Over the CPS timeframe the Bank will support the Government in strengthening its
capacity for results-based management. Through the implementation of the STATCAP Project
the Bank will be better positioned to support the Government build institutional capacity for
results-based management. The project will also help improve the Government’s informational
base of reliable, timely, accurate and representative information. Information generated through
the Population and Housing and Agricultural Censuses will permit tracking some development
outcomes and assessing core indicators.
Partnerships and Donor Coordination
89.
The streamlined coordination of official
development aid (ODA) and other financing is
critical to achieve the objectives set out in the
Government’s NDP. Although most public
investment is now financed with domestic
resources—72 percent in 2009 compared to 37
percent in 2005—ODA and other financing remain
important to implement the NDP. The largest
development partners measured by commitments
are the Andean Development Corporation (CAF),
IADB, the World Bank, Brazil, China and the
European Union (EU), comprising about threequarters of the total (Figure 4 and Annex 4). ODA
directed towards the health and education sectors

has been reduced considerably over the last decade, while ODA to the transport sector has
increased substantially.
90.
While some traditional donors are phasing out of Bolivia, a number of new ones are
increasing their commitments. Whereas traditional donors such as Denmark, the Netherlands
and the United Kingdom are either phasing out or have terminated their bilateral assistance to
Bolivia, the Morales administration is making use of new sources of funding and technical
assistance to implement its ambitious program, including Brazil, Colombia, China, Russia, South
Korea and Venezuela. The new donors form a highly diverse group and provide a new dynamic
to the different types of financial support and technical expertise when compared to traditional
donors. South-South cooperation has become increasingly important for the Government. The
Bank has provided valuable technical assistance through the South-South Experience Exchange
Trust Fund on multidimensional poverty, cash transfer programs and education.
91.
The Bank makes a special effort to coordinate with other development partners. The
GruS was established in late 2006 as a platform to better support the Government and its
development agenda. Most traditional bilateral and multilateral development agencies are
members of the GruS and many of them have aligned their assistance to the NDP and are
working towards the implementation of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Action Plan. More
recently, non-traditional partners such as Colombia, Korea and Brazil have expressed their
interest in working more closely with the GruS. The Ministry of Development Planning is
responsible for donor coordination and participates in GruS’s work. In addition, the Bank is an
active member of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT). Consultations were carried out
with the GruS and with local representatives of non-traditional donors such as China, Korea and
Brazil as part of the design of this proposed CPS.
Trust Fund Program and Strategy
92.
Trust funds are an important financing source for the Bank’s country program in
Bolivia. Trust fund resources are used to support Bank policy dialogue and operations through
co-financing and background analytical work, and also play an important role in knowledge
transfers through South-South capacity building activities. The recent work on CCT and rural
development in the context of the South-South trust fund are good examples of activities
supported by trust funds. Trust funds also help pilot innovative ideas such as the JSDF Trust
Fund on Early Childhood Care and Development and Gender. Trust funds can thus help to
leverage Bank resources further and are used as a unique platform for donors to strengthen
partnerships and cross-fertilization.
93.
Implementation of the WBG trust fund portfolio has been effective, but there is
room for improvement. These include more strategic alignment and realistic assessment of the
capacity and time needed for implementation and achievement of results. Selection criteria have
been developed and will be applied to trust funds more systematically by the Bank’s team.

29

IV. MANAGING RISKS
A. Political Risks
94.
Social demands to change specific public policies or projects could escalate, delaying
implementation of the NDP. Social organizations, including some indigenous groups, have
started to mobilize seeking public policy changes. Unable to channel their dissatisfaction with
specific policies through formal institutions, these groups are moving their agenda forward
through protests and demonstrations. Discontent may spread and intensify if the Morales
administration fails to build consensus with dissenting social groups and create common ground
to face policy implementation challenges. Furthermore, the process of aligning the legal
framework and institutions to the new Constitution could create short-term uncertainty and delay
the implementation of public policies.
95.
The Bank is working to mitigate these risks through the selective, targeted nature of
interventions proposed under the CPS. The focus of CPS activities—sustainable productive
development, adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management, access to basic and
social services for the rural and urban poor, and support for public sector effectiveness—are
supported by Bolivian society of all political inclinations, as validated during the extensive CPS
consultation process. Hence these projects are unlikely to suffer setbacks from potential political
turmoil, and positive project outcomes could work toward reducing some of the causes of social
tensions and protest. Furthermore, Bank-provided technical and financial assistance on
decentralization and autonomy legislation, statistical capacity and anti-corruption measures will
help strengthen governance in Bolivia.
B. Economic Risks
96.
Despite strong recent economic performance and macroeconomic policy, Bolivia is
vulnerable to a number of short- and medium-term risks. If the global economy recovers,
inflation may rise due to higher international food prices and foreign exchange inflows, while the
competitiveness of labor-intensive, non-traditional exports may be affected by exchange rate
appreciation. On the other hand, lower commodity prices and lower gas export volumes to Brazil
may erode the strong fiscal and external accounts. The nationalization process and the ongoing
reform of the legal framework are affecting the investment climate and potentially reducing
medium-term growth prospects. The hydrocarbons, mining and electricity sectors are close to
operating at maximum capacity and few large investment projects have taken place in the last
years. Additional private and public investment is needed to maintain Bolivia’s good
macroeconomic performance. Public investment is currently hampered by capacity constraints,
but if the public sector executes its ambitious pipeline investments, the Central Bank’s capacity
to control inflation may be undermined. Private activities may also be affected by interventions
in the economy, including price and export controls on food and restrictions on portfolio
decisions of financial institutions.
97.
Short-term economic risks are mitigated first and foremost by the prudent
macroeconomic management of Bolivian economic authorities. As noted by the IMF’s most
recent Article IV consultation and as demonstrated during the recent financial crisis, Bolivia is
well positioned to withstand short-term economic shocks due to restrained fiscal and monetary
30

policy and a declining debt profile. The Bank, in tandem with the IMF, will continue to closely
monitor macroeconomic developments and offer technical assistance when requested by the
authorities. Some potential areas for technical support include public debt management, in light
of the projected mild fiscal deficits by 2014 due to increased investment spending and
mechanisms to manage hydrocarbon income. Looking toward more long-term growth prospects,
the proposed Bank strategy is focused on productive development—in particular in the rural,
labor-intensive sector and in productive infrastructure—which will support more dynamic and
diversified economic activity.
C. Institutional Risks
98.
Bolivia faces numerous institutional challenges, including weak public sector
capacity, poorly defined responsibilities among different levels of government and stresses
caused by illegal activity and corruption. Wages are too low to attract and retain skilled
officials and, as a consequence staff turnover in public sector institutions is high and capacity
building is difficult. The recently approved Autonomies Law has only partially clarified the
responsibilities of different levels of government and has left contentious issues unresolved, in
particular the distribution of fiscal resources. Formal coordination mechanisms between different
government levels are not in place, hindering the implementation of some projects and programs.
In addition, the failure to improve the efficiency of sub-national governorates and other levels of
authority could pose risks to the Bank’s portfolio, especially in terms of financial management.
Bolivia’s illegal drug trade and contraband problems can—as noted in the WDR 2011—further
stress institutions through corruption and rent seeking practices.
99.
The Bank is working in several directions to reduce the risks posed by institutional
weakness. Joint semi-annual CPPRs will continue to be carried out with the Government to
monitor project design and implementation. Bank technical and fiduciary teams will continue
providing day-to-day guidance to counterparts during the preparation and execution phases of
projects to improve implementation and ensure the achievement of intended objectives.
Additionally, the design of operations will follow a more strategic approach, avoiding complex
institutional arrangements, promptly identifying risks to strengthen institutional capacity
components and building on existing arrangements and experienced entities whenever possible.
Transparency issues are being addressed through a number of actions. For example, two of the
Bank’s rural development projects that transfer funds directly to the community level, include
increased monitoring processes, disbursements that occur in tranches and public accountability
mechanisms for the local authorities that manage funds. Guidelines on fraud and corruption in
Bank-financed operations are intended to contain corruption risk, as is the country’s participation
in the StAR Initiative supported jointly by the Bank and the UN.

I.

Introduction

1.
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) provides an evaluation of the
Bank Group assistance to Bolivia for FY04-FY11 period. One Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and
two Interim Strategy Notes spanned this period. The Joint IBRD, IDA, IFC and MIGA FY04-FY05 CAS
for the Republic of Bolivia (Report No. 26838-BO) was submitted to the Board in January 2004. The
Joint IDA and IFC FY07-FY09 ISN for the Republic of Bolivia (Report No. 36095) (ISN I) and the Joint
IDA and IFC FY10-FY11 ISN for the Plurinational State of Bolivia (ISN II) were submitted to the Board
in October 2006 and April 2009, respectively.
2.
This CASCR was prepared using as background information the CAS, the two ISNs, the latest
Implementation Status Reports (ISR) for projects in the Bank’s Bolivia portfolio, Implementation
Completion and Results Reports (ICR) for credits that closed during the period, and by the Bolivia 19992004 Country Assistance Evaluation (Report No. 33493, 2005) prepared by the Bank’s then Operations
Evaluation Department.
II.
Findings of the Self-Evaluation
Program Performance Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Bank’s Performance Rating: Satisfactory
3.
Program Performance. It is difficult to rate Program Performance since the CAS and ISN I did
not provide Results Matrices, per sea. This CASCR retrofit a Matrix for the entire period, based on the
expected outcomes as described in each of the strategy documents (Annex I). The Program Performance
during the CAS period achieved its main objective: help maintain macroeconomic stability so as to
contain the social and economic impact of the crisis. This addressed one of the critical short-term issues
facing the Government at the time, and allowed the Bank in the next phase of the Program, covered by
ISN I to focus on and address more structural issues that had led to the country’s difficult social and
political issues. Performance under ISN I and ISN II, were more long-term in nature, seeking to address
the long-standing issues that were at the root cause of social, political and economic crisis Bolivia was
facing. The tremendous changes in Bolivia’s legal, institutional and political environment made progress
towards the Program’s objectives challenging. On balance, the Program achieved good progress toward
most major expected outcomes, with some shortcomings in the area of governance and support to the
public sector, which will undoubtedly be the focus of increased support in the future. Program
Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
4.
Bank’s Performance. The Bank’s Performance over the CASCR period is rated Satisfactory.
The Bank demonstrated ability to adjust and adapt to the difficult environment in which it was operating,
flexibility in designing its strategies by preparing short-term CAS and ISN that reflected critical issues,
ability to respond to changing priorities by the different Administrations and the emergencies they faced,
and, more importantly, the ability to engage effectively and productively with a Government that from
the outset had expressed extreme skepticism towards the Bank. Compared with the situation and
prospects in 2006, the Bank has in place a solid relationship and dialogue with the Government, and a
program of support to ongoing projects and non-lending services, together with a pipeline of new
a

Results Matrices were not prepared for several reasons: (1) at the time of the CAS, results matrices were not
required; (2) results matrices are not required for an ISN, although ISN II did include one that spanned the results of
ISN I; (2) each strategy covered a very short timeframe, which allowed at the most to complete the preparation and
approval of the interventions included in the strategy, and therefore it would be hard to identify and measure any
results and indicators during that period.

crisis in Bolivia.
III.

Review of the Progress Made Towards Achieving Country Level Goals

5.
Bolivia’s country level goals can be divided in two phases over the CASCR period. Although
some of the Government’s objectives and programs, especially those that addressed promoting rural
sector, environment, service delivery, were carried over across the CASCR period, the country’s goals in
2004 and 2005 were very short term in nature, and aimed at addressing the economic, political and social
issues that Bolivia was facing. The election of President Morales in December 2005 with a clear majority
and representing previously excluded groups provided a mandate to build a more inclusive society. As a
result, country level goals became more long term in nature.
Country Level Goals 2004-2005
6.
Goals. In 2004, Bolivia’s situation was difficult and uncertain, the result of the volatile
confluence of three trends—economic, political and social—that had been building up over several years.
These had led to escalating social unrest that culminated in the forced resignation of President Sanchez de
Lozada, and the assumption of Vice President Mesa in October 2003 in accordance with constitutional
processes. On the economic side, three features stood out--a lack of progress in poverty reduction and
high inequality, a vulnerability of the economy to external shocks, and a precarious fiscal situation. On
the political side, there had been growing disenchantment with the overt use of political patronage and
tolerance of corruption on the part of traditional political parties. Finally, on the social side, there was an
increasing impatience with the levels of inequality, particularly in land distribution, and indigenous
groups who felt that they had received little from the exploitation of natural resources in the past, were
increasingly suspicious of Government plans to export natural gas. The government of President Mesa
moved quickly to formulate a two phase plan to put the country back on a stable footing: (i) a first phase
through the planned completion of a Constitutional Assembly, and (ii) a second phase from the end of the
planned Constitutional Assembly to the end of the Presidential term in August 2007. The first phase
would pursue three political and three economic objectives. On the political front, the objectives were: (i)
revising the Hydrocarbons Law; (ii) submitting the decision to export natural gas from new sources to a
public referendum; and (iii) calling for a Constitutional Assembly to modify the then existing
Constitution. On the economic front, the objectives were: (i) restoring fiscal balances; (ii) reorienting
some public expenditure toward high-visibility programs that responded to underlying factors that led to
social conflict, especially in sensitive geographical areas; and (iii) re-launching anticorruption efforts to
improve the business environment.
7.
Progress. The first phase of President Mesa’s political agenda was never fully completed by the
time of his resignation in June 2005, when a transitional Government took over until new Presidential
and Congressional elections were held in December 2005. Of the three political objectives, only two were
implemented, and with mixed results. The Gas Referendum, which served as input into the new
Hydrocarbons Law, was approved by a strong majority in July 2004. It provided legitimacy to tackle the
sensitive gas export issue, abrogate the previous law, recover the property of hydrocarbons at the wellhead, reestablish the state-owned Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos, and use gas to negotiate
access to the Pacific Sea. However, its ambiguous wording produced different interpretations by political
parties and social movements alike on how to handle gas ownership and fueled an intense debate that
resulted in a Law that satisfied neither nationalists nor energy companies. Bolivia’s tax revenues from
natural gas became significantly higher than those of other countries in the region. In May 2005,
Congress approved a 18 percent royalty/32 percent non-deductible direct tax that was based on
production rather than revenue. The law explicitly stated that fiscal revenues could not drop below 50
percent of the hydrocarbon production value. With increasing tensions between the Government and gas

40

companies, and increasing uncertainty, foreign direct investment plummeted. There had also been little
progress towards the Constitutional Assembly scheduled to take place during the second half of 2006,
and no consensus regarding the criteria of representation in the Assembly. On the economic front,
President Mesa’s administration was largely successful. With fast disbursing assistance from both the
Bank and the IADB, the Government was able to close the 2004 financing gap, and with the Central
Bank handling of incipient runs on bank deposits and the exchange rate, macroeconomic stability was
maintained. Favorable external conditions and the new hydrocarbons tax regime, together with
constrained spending due to slow execution of public investment contributed to significantly reduce the
overall 2005 budget deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP down from 8 percent of GDP in 2003. In the fight
against corruption, results were mixed. The Government enforced a 80 percent reduction in “reserved
expenditures”, and appointed a Presidential Delegate for Anticorruption, but few actions were taken.
Country Level Goals 2006-2011
8.
Goals. When President Morales assumed office, Bolivia was facing a new political and economic
reality. The protests and previous instability had diminished the influence of traditional parties (the
Government had a majority in Congress) and brought new actors, mainly from the social movements.
Investment, particularly foreign, had been negatively impacted due to unrest and to uncertainty around
the government’s development agenda.
9.
The Government’s May 2006 National Development Plan (the Plan) has a strong focus on
poverty reduction and inclusion and proposed a profound social and political reform through a new
Constitution. The Plan is based on four pillars: (i) Bolivia Productiva (Productive Bolivia) that seeks to
increase the role of the state in strategic sectors—primarily natural resources and utilities—while
boosting labor-intensive sectors and integral territorial complexes through financial and technical
support; (ii) Bolivia Digna (Dignified Bolivia) that includes social programs—such as redistributive
transfers and safety nets—to fight poverty and exclusion; (iii) Bolivia Soberana (Sovereign Bolivia) that
seeks greater country ownership of Bolivia’s development process without external influences on
policies, strengthened status in international fora through balanced relations with other countries, and
self-sufficiency in food and energy production, and (iv) Bolivia Democrática y Participativa that
redefines power relations, transferring political power to social and indigenous movements. The
Constitutional Assembly was valued not only for its substantive outcome—dealing with complex issues
like decentralization, land and territory, and collective rights—but for the process itself, which was
expected to give voice to all Bolivians and strengthen national unity.
10.
Progress. Implementation of the Plan shows significant progress in some key areas while lagging
in others. Over the last four years, the Government increased its participation in strategic sectors by
nationalizing hydrocarbons, telecommunications, electricity, and mining companies, and creating several
small public enterprises. It has also expanded cash transfers to the elderly and launched cash transfer
programs to promote primary education attendance and the use of health services and neonatal care for
pregnant women and young children. The new Constitution was enacted in February 2009, and the legal
framework that will allow its implementation is being drafted, increasing social participation and
enhancing decentralization. The Government was less effective in boosting labor-intensive sectors, as
private investment remains sluggish. Public investment has been constrained by institutional problems
that delayed Government initiatives to increase the coverage of public services, build additional
infrastructure, industrialize natural resources, and create more public enterprises.
11.
There have been several promising developments, although many challenges remain. Due to the
relative isolation of its financial sector from the global markets, Bolivia’s GDP grew by 3.4 percent in
2009 (the highest in the region) despite the global crisis, while maintaining a current account surplus and
near balance in fiscal accounts. Growth in 2010 reached 4.1 percent as hydrocarbons output rebounded as

41

the result of recovering gas demand in Brazil, and other sectors continued robust growth. Overall
economic growth, together with the introduction or scaling up of cash transfer programs, is likely
responsible for reductions in moderate and extreme poverty: between 2000 and 2007, poverty and
extreme poverty dropped from 66 to 60 percent and from 45 to 38 percent respectively. Still, poverty is
significantly higher in rural areas, calling for differentiated strategies for urban and rural areas, as
proposed in the Plan, and progress in improving income distribution has been limited. Agricultural GDP
continues to rise—contributing 20 percent to GDP and employing about 65 percent of the country’s
workforce it is one of the main drivers of the economy—but has achieved only modest average growth
due to structural and institutional challenges. Substantial efforts are being made to modernize the sector
and to enhance productivity.
12.
Bolivia is broadly on target towards achieving MDG goals. In education important initiatives
have been implemented such as the literacy program Yo Si Puedo and the Bono Juancito Pinto cash
transfer for primary students. As measured by enrollment rates, schooling for children aged 12 and below
is nearly universal. Still, extending coverage and improving quality remains a challenge, mainly in the
pre-primary and secondary levels where in 2007, the net enrollment rates were just 38 percent and 57
percent, respectively. The Assembly has recently passed a new Education Law that will gradually enter
into force over the coming years. The Government introduced initiatives to expand access to and improve
quality of health services and to support improved nutrition. The new Constitution and legislation
guarantee equal rights for men and women, and equal access to social services. Infant mortality in urban
areas fell from 44 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2003 to 36 in 2008; progress in rural areas stagnated
during this period, however. There have been some advances for maternal health, but little impact on
outcomes. The Government has expanded the coverage of the Universal Maternal and Infant Insurance
Program (SUMI) and introduced a new approach to reduce cultural barriers to access health services. The
Zero Malnutrition Program (ZMP) and the CCT Bono Juana Azurduy were introduced to prevent and
tackle malnutrition in pregnant and breastfeeding women and children under two years, and to promote
increased use of health services.
13.
Governance, effective policy coordination and public sector efficiency require more attention but
there have been important initiatives in terms of anti-corruption and transparency. The Government took
measures to increase social control and accountability, strengthen transparency and access to information
and enhance anticorruption measures, including a national policy on transparency and anticorruption
approved in July 2009, the Law to Fight Corruption, Illegal Enrichment and Fortune Investigation
approved in March 2010, and the creation of a Ministry of Institutional Transparency and Fight against
Corruption. President Morales was re-elected with 64 percent of the votes in December 2009.
IV.
Highlights of the Detailed Evaluation of the Program Performance in influencing the CAS
outcomes as laid out in the results matrix
Objectives of Bank Assistance
14.
The Bank Group’s CAS supported the first phase of the Government’s agenda (para. 7) and
concentrated assistance as follows: (i) support to key economic and political processes; (ii)
macroeconomic stability and growth; (iii) promoting the rural sector and the environment; (iv) improving
service coverage and quality in the social sectors, and (v) public sector modernization, governance and
transparency. ISN I prioritized: (i) good governance emphasizing anticorruption; (ii) fostering job
creation through inclusive growth; and (iii) social inclusion through improved public service provision.
ISN II prioritized: (i) productive development and support to production; (ii) sustainable development;
(iii) human development; and (iv) governance and support to the public sector. This section evaluates the
Program’s performance according to the retrofitted CAS outcome classifications under the column
CASCR Evaluation in the Table 4 (Annex 2.4).

Progress in Influencing CAS and ISN Outcomes
15.
Support to Key Economic and Political Processes. While the Bank’s assistance towards this
CAS outcome was delivered through technical assistance on the hydrocarbons legislation and an IDF
grant to support the coordination of the Constitutional Assembly, it is not clear that it provided an impact
on softening the transition of key economic and political processes, which were by definition, short term,
and expected to be influenced through other means. Furthermore, through a Nationalization Decree in
mid-2006, the Government increased its control of the hydrocarbon industry, and the state oil company,
Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), will hold at least 50 percent plus one of the total
shares of companies “capitalized” and/or privatized back in the 1990s. To continue operating, oil
companies had to sign new service contracts with YPFB that will handle all hydrocarbon
commercialization. While the new Hydrocarbons Law served to increase government revenues, Bolivia
has faced challenges in realizing investments to increase its gas production capacity, as YPFB has not
been able to boost sector development. In retrospect, the Bank was and is not well positioned or qualified
to provide support to political processes of the magnitude that Bolivia faced at the time.
16.
Macroeconomic Stability and Growth. Support from the Bank and IADB was instrumental in
sustaining macroeconomic balance during 2004, thereby helping contain the social and economic impact
of the political crisis. Bolivia’s macroeconomic situation was fragile, with a fiscal deficit between 8 and 9
percent of GDP and a large financing gap. A package of policy-based fast-disbursing assistance including
an Emergency Economic Recovery Credit, a Social Safety Net Credit, and funding of wages and salaries
of civil servants under an ongoing Institutional Reform Project provided a rapid infusion of liquidity to
support the end-of-year US$94 million fiscal gap caused in part by the ongoing social and political
tensions and episodes of civil unrest and the drop in external financing (amounting to 0.1 percent of the
overall deficit in terms of GDP) that resulted largely by the difficulties in producing a Poverty Reduction
Strategy (which in turn led to postponing the Bank’s planned US$30 million Poverty Reduction Strategy
Credit and the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility). This assistance allowed the Government
to maintain critical social programs. With the changes in the hydrocarbons regime, Bolivia’s previous
customary fiscal deficits have turned into surpluses that together with relatively favorable external
conditions have resulted in improvements in economic growth, even though private investment has
remained low.
17.
The Bank-financed Bank and Corporate Sector Restructuring Program (BCRP) supported
important financial sector legal, regulatory and institutional reforms—including the confirmation of the
Superintendency of Banks and Financial Entities as the exclusive authority in matters of prudential norms
and regulations, strengthening the financial sector and reducing the risk of future systemic financial
crises. The reforms supported by the first phase are in place, but priorities have focused now on
broadening and deepening access to credit, particularly to small and medium enterprises and agriculture,
and not towards corporate restructuring that was to be the focus of a second phase. The Bank
complemented its financial assistance towards this strategic objective with a strong program of analytical
and advisory services including a Public Expenditure Review (carried out jointly with the IADB);
Poverty Assessment which fed into the design of Bank-financed operations; a Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) focused on employment-generating economic growth and policies aimed at
improving investment climate and boosting exports, a Credit Bureau Assessment carried out as part of the
Western Hemisphere Credit Bureau Initiative, a series of Financial Sector Notes to update knowledge on
the sector (described in para. 21 below) and a recently-concluded Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Non-lending Technical Assistance studies on the private sector (on topics such as urban alliances, partial
credit risk guarantees, moveable assets as collateral) were also delivered to support preparation of a
project on urban alliances, but the project was eventually dropped due to frequent changes in the
counterparts. Despite the difficult environment for private sector investments in Bolivia, IFC continued

43

its effort to implement its support strategy based on the selective provision of financing for viable, highimpact projects, monitoring its portfolio as well as providing technical assistance and capacity building.
However, IFC’s outstanding investments have declined from US$235.3 million in September 2005 to
US$39.4 million in January 2011.
18.
Productive Development and Support to Production, including Sustainable Development. The
CAS recognized the importance of promoting the rural sector in order to reduce poverty (estimated at
about 90 of the rural population) and inequality and contemplated actions aimed at improving conditions
for productive activities and creating income-generating opportunities. Infrastructure, mainly rural roads,
access to basic services and land, sustainable productive initiatives, and biodiversity conservation were
prioritized. There have been some important initiatives supported by lending, that have made promising
progress towards improving living and economic conditions in rural areas through improved
infrastructure, and, at the same time, developed innovative approaches, adapted to Bolivia’s reality, to
ensure that the rural population would benefit from the jobs generated by the projects. The Participatory
Rural Investment Project II (PDCR II) is helping to develop practical instruments to ensure coordination
in public investment and reduce duplication of efforts and has acquired increased relevance within the
constitutional reform, which intends to clarify inter-governmental relations. Rural municipalities have
conducted participatory transportation planning that has provided complete information on road
networks, categorizing each road according to the population served, condition, and maintenance or
upgrading need. On this basis, mayors and communities have defined their priorities, taking into account
their budgetary capacity. The PDCR II also helped communities implement spot improvements as the key
modality of intervention in the road network. This has allowed municipalities and communities to focus
on year-round accessibility, rather than speed of circulation. The cost of road improvements has fallen by
approximately half, allowing the project to finance 900 kilometers of roads with just US$4 million,
directly benefiting close to 220,000 people in the remotest areas of the country that now have access to an
all-season road. The success of the Rural Alliances Project, has led the Government to create the
Empoderar program, intended as the main line of action to improve access to markets, production and
competitiveness on the part of poor rural producers. Success in implementing grants that are managed by
the producer organizations themselves has served as an example for other rural development programs.
The project has had significant impact, as it is focused on an important conceptual shift from producer
support focused on the needs of producers and their organizations, without regard for market
competitiveness to support for market opportunities of producer organizations, as demonstrated in
alliances with buyers who express a specific demand. Over 13,000 families received direct benefits from
296 producer subprojects financed, of which 83 percent have positive financial results. The National
Land Administration Project (NLAP) obtained important achievements, including legislation and
regulations necessary for carrying out streamlined land regularization, and the establishment of the
National Agrarian Tribunal as a special part of the Judicial Branch. After five full years of operation, the
NLAP had opened 50 tribunals and resolved 1,684 cases of agrarian land rights disputes. In addition, land
registries in nine departmental capitals and three regional centers transferred to the Instituto Nacional de
Reforma Agraria (INRA). The Land for Agricultural Development Project (LADP) is establishing a
decentralized beneficiary-driven land distribution mechanism that is allowing organized landless or poor
farmers to acquire suitable agricultural loans and implement investment projects which would put them
on a sustainable, higher income livelihood paths by providing a revolving line of credit to finance land
purchases and matching grants for infrastructure and productive investments on the purchased lands.
Productive Associations, established and supported under the project, are responsible for the repayment
of the land acquisition loans and the acquired lands serve as collateral. The LADP is particularly relevant,
since land is a high-visibility issue that is the cause of potentially explosive conflicts between
indigenous/peasant groups and large landowners in the eastern part of the country. Despite
implementation issues, the Indigenous Peoples Development Project (Indigenous LIL) financed--together
with indigenous producer groups--40 pilot investments in the areas of community tourism, handicraft
production and marketing and basic processing of renewable natural resources and both demonstrated

44

that community groups can manage funds successfully and revealed the institutional and regulatory
practices that place barriers in transferring resources directly to social organizations.
19.
Support to infrastructure development also produced important outcomes, both to promote
growth and exports and increase access of rural areas to markets and services. The Abapo-Camiri
Highway within the transport corridor which links Bolivia with Argentina and Paraguay is estimated to
have reduced transport costs, vehicle operating costs, travel time from Santa Cruz to Yacuiba and traffic
volumes on this now all-weather road have increased by 138 percent. In addition, access for rural
communities was provided by the rehabilitation and maintenance of some adjacent access roads. The
Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project has rehabilitated priority sections of the national road
network resulting in increases in freight transport and passenger transport. Rehabilitation of the priority
Calamarca-San Pedro and Boyuibe- Yacuiba sections provides continuity to the Abapo-Camiri highway
and access to Mercosur markets and has contributed to a reduction in freight transport tariffs from
Bolivia’s lowlands to Argentina, and an increase use of those roads by trucks. Equally impressive, the
Project introduced a successful results-based routine maintenance program for the entire primary road
network) by fostering the use of micro-enterprises in the routine maintenance of roads—keeping the
roads clean and preventing their deterioration. The Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural Transformation
Project--the second largest Bank-financed renewable energy-based electrification project in LCR--is
expanding and improving electricity delivery as a catalyst for the development of rural areas. It is
financing competitively awarded subsidies to the private sector to expand electricity services and
supporting expansion through solar systems in isolated rural areas and grid densification in peri-urban
areas. With a new regulatory framework for rural electrification and the establishment of a financing
mechanism for the program, Programa Eectricidad para Vivir con Dignidad, the Project has installed
solar home systems in the poorest rural areas, benefiting an estimated 45,000 people. In addition, solar
home systems have been installed in schools and clinics, benefiting an additional 30,000 people; public
lighting has been provided for 20,000 in poor, urban areas. The Urban Infrastructure Project has exceeded
its original targets in providing access to sewage connections, and property values as measured by the
cost of rent in participating poor neighborhoods in La Paz have increased over four times what had been
expected due to improved access to basic urban services. The Government has expressed interest in a
possible additional financing and the Municipal Services Study, currently under preparation, will provide
inputs towards a larger potential intervention in the provision of basic infrastructure to the urban poor.

The Bolivian economy is strongly exposed to natural disaster risks, and these affect mostly the
poor. A joint Damage and Loss Assessment estimated the La Niña flood of December 2007 alone to have
caused damages and losses worth US$443 million overwhelming the Government’s ability to respond to
rehabilitation and recovery needs. The Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project and a
related Additional Financing have supported rehabilitation of the productive capacity in affected
communities. They respond to the objectives of the Government’s National Plan for Sustainable
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (PRESS), and the 2008-2010 Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
National Plan that aim to strengthen the ability to respond to future disasters by moving from a reactive to
a proactive approach by investing in risk mitigation measures and by improving risk evaluation in
planning and reconstruction. The Sustainability of the National System of Protected Areas GEF Project
has had important results in ten of the 22 protected areas, and has provided minimum infrastructure and
equipment to ensure effective management and operation of each area. A key achievement is that
communities within and around the areas are increasingly involved and committed to the conservation
following environmental education in communities neighboring the areas, and the piloting of sustainable,
biodiversity-related, income-generating activities within areas and their buffer zones.
21.
Bolivia faces important challenges to improve its traditionally weak investment climate to spur
private sector development, and the Bank’s non-lending assistance focused on providing analysis and
policy options. A study on Policies for Increasing Firms’ Formality and Productivity assessed the

45

productivity constraints faced by Bolivian firms, identifying policies to encourage their productivity and
formality. These policies vary according to the size of the firm and were prioritized to formulate a
comprehensive support program. Following from this, the Bank provided several analytical works to,
inter alia, provide advice on productivity and trade issues (including logistics), evaluate specific issues on
informality among women entrepreneurs and evaluate the Bolivian trade policy and its effects on nontraditional labor-intensive exports. A series of Financial Sector Notes followed a modular approach to
foster dialogue and accommodate topics of interest to the Government. Topics included the transitioning
of financial cooperatives into the regulatory sphere, and comparing the applicable regulatory framework
with regional standards. This study, in combination with a South-South Dialogue with Mexico on their
experience in bringing cooperatives under prudential oversight, has helped the Government refine its
reform agenda. Another report in this series focuses on outreach to rural areas and assessing the financial
sector’s potential role in fostering productive sector credit. The Bank and the government are currently
exploring possible follow-up to implement some of the findings.
22.
Human Development. Although it remained among the poorest countries in the Latin America
region, Bolivia had made considerable progress in social outcomes in the decade preceding the CAS.
Building on the Social Safety Net SAC, two Social Sector Programmatic Credits protected this
performance from the political volatility and macroeconomic situation in the 2004-2005 period. Together,
this policy-based lending resulted in improved sector policy frameworks, congruent with accelerating
progress towards the MDGs, and promoted results-based orientation and accountability. The only area in
which advances were limited was for water and sanitation, where political conflicts led to the suspension
of the Aguas de Illimani water concession in El Alto. This policy reversal led to the withdrawal of the
water and sanitation sector from the programmatic operation, and a reduction in the amount financed. At
the time of the ISN I design, Bolivia still faced substantial social inequality. Education coverage had
shown improvement, but universal coverage remained a considerable challenge—particularly for rural
and indigenous populations—and the quality of education was very low. Complemented by
comprehensive sector work, lending was highly successful in promoting decentralized management and
community participation and produced promising results. Under the Education Quality and Equity
Strengthening Project the average years of schooling for students in project areas increased from 6.1 to
7.4, the percentage of students with satisfactory academic achievement in Grade 3 increased from 89.9 to
91.2 percent, and gender disparities in average years of schooling were reduced. The Secondary
Education Transformation Project, has so far provided the intended new infrastructure, enrolled 4,500
students in an incentive program to reduce the risk of drop-out, and supported 178 schools in the
preparation of School Improvement Plans aimed at improving education quality. Following the
successful Health Sector Reform Project that closed in 2003, the Second Health Sector Reform Project
was successful in increasing the coverage of births attended by trained health personnel which increased
from 54 percent to 57 percent, complete prenatal care attendance from 33 percent to 40 percent; early
neonatal hospital mortality remained at eight per 1,000 live births; the number of pneumonia cases
attended in health services increased from 112,000 to 174,000; and the percentage of children with iron
supplement (third iron dose) increased from 8 percent to 20 percent. Eighty five percent of project
beneficiaries belong to the two lowest wealth quintiles population, indicating a high pro-poor targeting.
The Expanding Access to Reduce Health Inequalities APLIII was approved in 2008 but is facing
implementation challenges. With poverty reduction at the center of President Morales’ agenda, the Bank
has provided continuous non-lending assistance and evidence-based analysis aimed at informing the
Government’s social protection strategy under the Programmatic Social Protection AAA. As a result of
the success of this AAA in terms of its support for client engagement and dialogue to inform strategy, the
program is now in its fifth year of continuous implementation, providing just-in-time assistance on a
programmatic basis. Based on priorities identified in this AAA, the Investing in Children and Youth
Project is supporting two flagship programs of the Government’s Social Protection and Integrated
Community Development Strategy: (i) the Bono Juana Azurduy, which is under the umbrella of the Zero
Malnutrition Program and addresses chronic malnutrition through a conditional cash transfer aimed at

46

benefiting pregnant women and children under two-years-old in the most vulnerable municipalities; and
(ii) the Mi Primer Empleo Digno (My First Dignified Employment), a skill-development program for low
income youth living in poor urban areas to enhance their ability to find and maintain a good quality job.
The Project has developed the information system, including beneficiary registries through which
financing of cash transfers of the Bono Juana Azurduy will be made, and a pilot phase of Mi Primer
Empleo has been successfully completed in four cities, and incorporating adjustments based on the pilot,
has been expanded to six additional ones.
23.
Governance and Support to the Public Sector. While an important priority for Bolivia, this was
the most challenging area of Bank assistance, which required both flexibility on the Bank’s part in terms
of engaging with the various Governments through a mix of lending and non-lending services, and
adjustment to redefined priorities for both reforms and their corresponding implementation strategies.
Based on findings of the 2004 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the Government in
2005 presented the “Strategic Framework for Strengthening Public Finances” that was endorsed by the
Donor Community. Although progress was uneven, key actions were implemented, including: the
expansion of the system for budget control and monitoring (SIGMA) both at the central, and sub-national
levels and the implementation of a functional classification of expenditures and the implementation of the
Single Treasury Account. Under the Institutional Reform I Project (IRP I), limited progress was made
toward the achievement of its objectives, including the vertical reforms introduced in three pilot agencies
(tax, customs and road agencies). However, the development of a modern, result oriented management
system failed. Also, in view of the Government’s redefined institutional reform strategy coupled with
repeated staffing changes, a follow-up to this Project did not advance as planned. Some progress was
achieved in the preparation of planned operations to support the governance pillar, although these have
yet to show results. A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Report assessed the
pubic financial management system, and identified and prioritized reforms. In January 2011 a
Strengthening Statistical Capacity and Informational Base for Evidence-Based Planning Project was
approved. The planned Strengthening State Efficiency and Transparency Project has been converted into
non-lending technical assistance to improve the public investment process and the coordination among
different government levels. The Bank has also supported governance through institutional strengthening
components in its projects, paying particular attention to improvements in monitoring and evaluation
systems. Following Bolivia’s participation in the Bank’s 2007 global consultation on “Strengthening
World Bank Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption” the Government reiterated its strong
commitment to fighting corruption and increasing transparency in the use of public resources; a mandate
that has been assigned to the Ministry of Institutional Transparency, and Fight against Corruption.
V.
Brief Review of the Bank’s Performance in designing and managing the implementation of
the program
Design of the Strategy
Relevance and Alignment with Country Development Priorities
24.
The Bank’s program was relevant and, as it was short-term by design allowed the flexibility
needed to ensure alignment with the Bank’s comparative advantage, and country priorities in areas where
there was agreement throughout the period. The short term nature of the CAS, and the timing of the two
ISNs ensured that the Bank’s assistance responded in the first instance, to the country’s short-term
macroeconomic needs, and later, to the Morales Administration’s priorities. The timing of ISN I, for
example, allowed for dropping a Second Bank and Corporate Sector Restructuring Program and the
Institutional Reform II Project that were not in line with the Government’s priorities, and intensifying
lending and non-lending assistance in support of the new Government’s focus on poverty, productive
development and support to production, and human development. Some of the projects in the portfolio

47

(e.g., Institutional Reform) were completed, but lost their relevance due to new priorities; consequently
their outcome was not satisfactory.
Selection of Areas of Engagement and Instruments
25.
The selection of areas of engagement was appropriate. In 2004-2005, the Bank correctly focused
on helping maintain macroeconomic stability through policy-based loans, aimed mostly at protecting
social programs. Starting in 2006, and, with little knowledge of the plans of the new Administration, and
some concern for future policy directions, the shift on investment lending focusing on productive
development and support to production and human development was also appropriate. While the Bank’s
focus on governance and anticorruption was justified---Bolivia’s Corruption Perception Index released by
Transparency International gave Bolivia a score of 2.5 ranking the country at 114 out of 158 countries—
the Bank may have been ambitious in planning two operations under ISN I that would address difficult
issues before having established a solid relationship with the Government based on mutual trust. It also
may have underestimated the intense restructuring that the country would face in implementing a new
Constitution. In the end, the Bank worked intensively and jointly through non-lending services in order to
build this trust and a program of lending that responds to the Government’s priorities.
Realism of the Expected Outcomes and Quality of Results Framework
26.
ISN II had a Results Framework including Milestones and ISN Outcomes that together with the
text of the CAS and earlier ISN have been used to retrofit a Framework for the CASCR period (Annex
2.1). The Results Framework in ISN II mentioned explicitly that eight of the then active projects would
only start their implementation in FY2010, several projects identified under the ISN would only be
submitted to the Board for approval shortly before the completion of the ISN, and that as a result, the
outcomes were expected to materialize much later than the FY2010-2011 timeframe. In that context, the
outcomes identified referred to results expected upon or beyond the closing of projects, while the
milestones were expected to show some progress during implementation of the ISN.
Identification of Critical Risks
27.
There is no question that Bank assistance throughout this period was faced with considerable
risks. The short duration of the CAS and ISNs was in response to the risky and totally uncertain
environment. The CAS and the ISNs each highlighted these risks very explicitly and extensively. The
three main risks identified in the CAS all materialized: (i) Congress was still controlled by traditional
political parties, (ii) President Mesa did not serve his full constitutional term, (iii) strong demands were
being placed on the government from different sectors while the government had limited capacity to
respond, and (iv) there were several groups that wanted to see the government fail. As a result, the first
phase of President Mesa’s agenda was never fully completed. Perhaps the risk that had not been
contemplated was that the Bank would not be able to continue to deliver assistance in Bolivia through the
Country Office and visiting missions due to the increasing violence in the last months of President
Mesa’s administration. Of the risks identified in the ISNs the main one that materialized related to
institutional and fiduciary aspects, and the portfolio, that together resulted in delays in new lending, and
issues with portfolio management. The mitigation strategies identified and implemented to address those
risks were helpful in reducing their impact. Public sector wage reductions made it difficult to attract and
retain highly skilled public servants and frequent turnover of project staff, including those working with
financial management. The recently approved Constitution is having some impact on the institutional and
other arrangements for Bank-financed projects, including in the definition of responsibilities across three
levels of government, but so far these have been address through project restructurings.

48

Adjusting the Program to Changing Country Circumstances and Priorities
28.
The very short-term nature of the CAS and ISNs, and their timing, in part contained the need to
make major adjustments in planned assistance. Yet, when appropriate, the Bank adjusted the planned
program to changing circumstances and priorities, by proving finance for unexpected emergencies,
scaling up the impact and results of successful projects through additional financing, and demonstrating
flexibility in the choice of instruments while still focusing on expected outcomes by converting planned
lending assistance non-lending technical assistance to accomplish similar assistance objectives.
Implementation of the CAS/ISN Program.
Performance in Supporting the Implementation of Projects/Programs in the Portfolio.
29.
Portfolio Level. The portfolio shrunk from 14 projects at the inception of the CAS to five projects
in FY2007. A strong lending program in FY2008, together with subsequent approvals and closures
resulted in a portfolio of 11 projects by end-FY2011. The Table below summarizes the main portfolio
indicators.

Portfolio Management. The Bank provided strong portfolio support throughout the period to
ensure both continued relevance and timely attention to implementation issues. Proactivity was high, and
the number of problem projects has declined. Effectiveness delays still account for the high number of
projects at risk. Country Financing Parameters were introduced early to help alleviate the fiscal impact of
the Bank’s assistance by allowing the financing of recurrent costs, local currency costs, taxes and duties
and other eligible expenditures. Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) were held yearly, and
served as a forum for the Government and project implementing agencies to work with the Bank’s
Country Team to identify and agree upon steps to address bottlenecks and issues. Detailed AideMemoires recorded the CPPRs’ findings and agreed follow-up actions. Under this umbrella framework,
and with follow up under routine implementation support for individual operations, some projects were
restructured to adjust project objectives and/or descriptions and address implementation issues (e.g.,
increasing financing percentages, modifying institutional arrangements). Despite proactive supervision,
project implementation in a volatile and changing environment was not easy. Of the twenty projects that
exited the portfolio, nine were evaluated as either MU or U in the Implementation Completion Reports.
Several issues affected projects’ implementation, including, frequent changes in implementing agencies’
staff, weak procurement, financial management and operational capacity to support implementation,
hiring difficulties, lack of clarity of the new institutional structure, delays in issuing no-objections, and
counterpart funding constraints. The Bank intensified the number of seminars and workshops it delivered
to relevant staff of executing agencies on the subjects of procurement, disbursement, financial

49

management and safeguards. The identification of implementation issues, such as effectiveness delays,
has led to advancing several tasks during preparation to avoid implementation delays.
31.

Individual Project Level. Individual project progress is presented in Annex 2.1.

32.
Financial Management. Starting with a joint Bank and IADB Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) in 2004, the Bank has continuously supported initiatives to strengthen government
systems to increasingly rely on these for Bank-financed projects. A Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) carried out in 2009 has provided useful information on the strengths
and weakness of public financial management systems, and the Government is using this to develop an
action plan that addresses identified issues with the support of the donor community.
Supporting the Design of New Projects/Programs
33.
There were considerable delays in delivering planned lending, in part due to the need to redefine
projects to the new Administration’s priorities, and in part due to constraints of working in a changing
institutional environment with weak staffing capacity (Table 2, Annex 2.2). Following the strong
program of fast-disbursing assistance in FY2004, progress towards preparation of investment lending fell
short of expectations. Of the US$597.0 planned lending during the period (of which US$125.0 million
was to be IBRD and US$472.0 million IDA), only US$448.9 million was approved, of which only
US$15.0 million was IBRD. Additional financing was delivered for the well-performing projects. There
was no lending in 2006, lending in 2007 was mostly delayed, and there was a near doubling of lending in
2008 against what had been planned in ISN I, mostly due to delays in preparation caused by the change in
administration in 2005 and the subsequent bunching of new lending. Most of the new investment lending
supported the CAS outcomes of Productive Development and Support to Production (69 percent), and
Human Development (31 percent). Several operations were dropped in view of the new Administration’s
priorities.
Relevance of Knowledge-Based Activities
34.
The Bank’s program of analytical and advisory services (AAA) (Table 3, Annex 2.3) was
extensive, well designed to provide support in areas where lending services were neither desired, nor
justified (e.g., technical assistance for the Hydrocarbons Law), and effective in identifying key issues and
topics for a policy dialogue. Recommendations of the Bank’s AAA have been used as input to the
Government’s National Development Plan. Just-in-time Policy Option Notes prepared at the beginning of
President Morales’ administration served to initiate a dialogue with a somewhat skeptical government,
and then provided a road map for Bank assistance in areas that responded to the Government’s priorities.
AAA was designed and used effectively to feed into the development of new programs and projects and
used a variety of instruments tailored to the particular need, including formal sector work, non-lending
technical assistance, policy notes, etc. AAA also proved to be an important instrument in sustaining a
dialogue in areas where the project support lagged. Especially important were the programmatic AAAs
that provided an overall instrument to adjust to priorities and requests while providing just in time
support. Finally, Bolivia’s participation in Bank-sponsored global consultations (e.g., Governance and
Anticorruption) with representatives from Congress, the Administration, the Judiciary, Civil Society, and
others, resulted in the Government reiterating its strong commitment to fighting corruption and increasing
transparency, for which the Bank will provide non-lending technical assistance.
35.
The WBI also provided important support; throughout most of the period Bolivia was one of the
WBI’s focus countries in LAC. The WBI’s priority was to address learning and capacity development
needs in the sectors where the Bank was engaged in lending activities and/or analytical work by
providing access to international knowledge and experience, both through structured training programs

50

and by facilitating “just-in-time” exchange with practitioners from other countries. Sectors/themes of
focus included: governance/anticorruption, decentralization, education, and rural development.
Consultations, outreach and dissemination through the Country Office were an integral part of the Bank’s
assistance. Broader dissemination of the analytical work and greater openness in Bolivia have helped to
position the Bank as an important independent source of information and to improve the Bank’s image in
the country, and has served to promote wide and transparent debate among civil society groups on issues
of importance to development. Notes on project and studies were translated and disseminated widely,
including on the Bank’s Bolivia web page. The Bank’s Country Office also worked to involve civil
society in the design and implementation of projects financed by the Bank, and promoted conferences to
exchange experiences and views, often with participation of other countries.
Bank’s efforts for Enhancing the Effectiveness of Overall Assistance Provided by all Donors
36.
Although decreasing as a percentage of GDP, official development aid remains important for
Bolivia. The Bank participated actively in donor coordination fora to maintain the alignment of its
assistance with the NDP and the donors’ assistance. The Bank participated directly in the five Mesas de
Coordinación organized by the Government in late 2006 to discuss sector plans and the NDP
implementation, co-leading the Mesa Bolivia Digna together with the Netherlands. In addition to the
Mesas, a Partners Group for the Development of Bolivia (GruS) was created in late 2006 to serve as a
platform to better support the Government and its NDP. The chair of the GruS is elected on a semiannual basis; the Bank chaired in during the second half of 2009. On a more operational level, the Bank
participates in many of the 16 sector sub-groups that report to the GruS on a regular basis, and is co-chair
of the Disaster Management and Emergency sub-group and the Water and Sanitation sub-group. The
Bank is also an active member of the United Nations Country Team--and strengthened its participation in
2008--in order to promote harmonization and seek synergies to improve the work of the entire system in
the field. The Bank has also provided valuable technical assistance under the South-South Experience
Exchange Trust Fund.
The Effectiveness of the Dialogue and Business Relations with the Authorities
37.
The Bank’s dialogue with the Mesa Administration was by design short-term in nature. Dialogue
with the Rodriguez administration was limited by the short term of his administration and by the
increasing tensions and violence that resulted in the withdrawal of the Bank’s Country Office Staff and
the restriction in travel. The Bank was the first major donor to engage with the President Morales’
Administration. This rapid engagement helped clear up negative perceptions of the Bank and other
multilaterals, and contributed to the development of a trusting environment that helped build a positive
relationship. Starting with technical briefings between the Bank’s Country Team and President Morales’
policy team during the campaign period and then after elections, the Bank immediately prepared a series
of Policy Notes that were discussed at a high-level event in March 2006. The Government and the Bank
identified assistance priorities in areas where there was agreement, and these discussions provided a
sound basis for the development of an assistance strategy to the new Government.
How the Bank mitigated risks and managed the Program when some of the Risks Materialized.
38.
Successive strategies had identified extensive risks, many of which materialized. The short-term
nature of each of the strategies was designed to mitigate these risks. Towards the last months of the CAS,
the Bank’s involvement was curtailed due to the violence in the country. When President Rodriguez
assumed power, assistance resumed on a limited scale. During this period, however, the Bank began
engaging with presidential candidates, including President Morales through targeted workshops, aimed at
explaining the Bank’s mandate, assistance program and possibilities for future engagement. A strong
program of AAA in FY2004-FY2006 enabled the Bank to engage productively in discussions with the

51

new administration. While the situation was uncertain, the alternative of not engaging could have been
worse, with the Bank losing a historic opportunity for working pragmatically to help assess alternatives
with the benefit of international best practices and lessons learned and, thereby, enhancing the prospects
for positive outcomes. Implementation and program risks were mitigated by demonstrating
responsiveness to new priorities and emergencies, flexibility in the choice of instrument, willingness to
provide strong technical and advisory services, including in increased portfolio and program monitoring
and the project restructuring to address new institutional realities.
VI.

Key Lessons and Suggestions for the New CAS

39.
There are important lessons of experience for the Bank from its assistance during the CASCR
period that are relevant to the Bank in general, and to the design of its future strategy for Bolivia. First,
the Bank’s Performance in Bolivia offers a positive experience of Bank engagement with a Government
that may not share the same views in all areas. Progress in private sector development and attracting
private investment may be limited, but by showing flexibility, openness, listening to country priorities
and strategies and selectively supporting those areas where there is a convergence of views and
approaches, the Bank has developed a positive engagement with the Government in support of a program
that is yielding promising results in terms of improving the prospects for its population. Second, although
the political risk has diminished, at least until when the next pre-electoral period begins, there still exists
a high degree of social and institutional risk in view of the process to implement the various legal aspects
of the new Constitution. This risk could come to affect not only new lending, but especially projects in
the portfolio as their implementing arrangements may need to adjust to a new institutional framework.
While the provision of both intensive analytical and advisory services and implementation support may
mitigate this risk, its impact on the program should not be underestimated. Third, the new Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) should coincide with the end of the Presidential term. The implementation of
several projects and a productive program of analytical and advisory services have shown that it is
possible to make a marked impact on economic and social issues that have affected Bolivia’s
development, especially of its large rural population. Over the next CPS period, several ongoing projects
will likely produce important results. The Bank should prepare succinct, informative project “notes”
highlighting projects’ successful experiences, accomplishments and future challenges to provide
continuity. Irrespective of a future election’s outcome, Bolivia’s continued progress and social stability
depends fundamentally on improving the livelihood of its population, especially the rural poor. Many of
these projects will provide important lessons for future programs and assistance efforts. Finally, results
monitoring, and showing results, should be an important focus, for both the Government and the Bank.
Promising ongoing initiatives and programs could offer important knowledge that could be applied in
countries facing similar challenges. The next CPS should include a carefully articulated Results Matrix
that will allow the Bank and the Government to review progress at the end of the CPS period. Perhaps,
given that this will be the first full assistance strategy in several years, the Bank might want to adopt a
programmatic approach to its CPS. Following the model of programmatic lending and non-lending
services, the CPS could formulate a broad, framework strategy for FY2012-2015, with a very defined
assistance program for FY2012 and broader objectives and assistance plans and amounts for the
subsequent years, flexibility with respect to instruments with a provision for yearly discussions and
agreement in the context of yearly CPPRs, to adjust and reorient priorities to progress, results achieved
and emerging priorities, against the Results Matrix.

Government priority:
From ISN I:
 Decentralization to the municipal level
of government increased
 Greater participation of civil society
organizations employed to increase
public oversight and help enforce
tranparency
From ISN II:
 Improved performance information on
public programs to allow tracking
progress of key programs
 Sector plans are aligned to the
National Development Plan
 Increased coordination among sector

Status: Partially Achieved

 Vertical reforms introduced in three
pilot agencies (tax, customs and roads
agencies), as well in the nascent
process of civil service reform and
human resource management.
 The results-based monitoring system
(SISER) and its normative framework
were formally achieved.
 SISER was mainly used during the first
years of the project for higher-level
monitoring (for instance by ministers)

Lessons learned:
 The project strategy relied squarely on
the strong leadership role of
personalities, rather than placing the
project within an institutionally strong
agency.
 Neither the project nor its specific
reform elements were “marketed” (in
spite of some budget for this) to those
who might have been prepared to
support it.
 The ambitious project agenda made the
implementation of some reforms
dependant on other ones being carried
out elsewhere, causing important

 Strong analytical work could have
provided information about alternatives
for reform and reduced the expectations
generated by the project’s ambitious
design.
 It is extraordinarily difficult to compare
the achievements (and failures) of the
Institutional Reform Program to
national reform efforts elsewhere,
because public sector reforms are “soft”
reforms specific to different national
environments and difficult to categorize
and quantify.
 The strength of Bolivia’s approach has
been to anchor its vertical reforms in a
common set of rules to control political
interference in the appointments of top
managers and of civil servants.

Annex 3: Consultations with Civil Society, Women’s Organizations and the International
Development Cooperation
A consultative process was undertaken to inform the development of the CPS. Nine
consultation workshops took place across Bolivia, three with civil society, three with women’s
organizations and three with the Group of Partners for the Development of Bolivia (GruS). A
total of 300 people participated. The workshops provided spaces to discuss themes linked to the
results areas of the new CPS and facilitated an understanding of the challenges, priorities and
obstacles to be considered. The participants included representatives from women’s indigenous
and peasant organizations, the private sector, NGOs, productive organizations, municipal
councils, departmental assemblies, youth groups, and women’s platforms and movements.
I. Consultations with Civil Society: Debates and Recommendations
A.
Food crises, security and sovereignty in Boliviaa
Food security and sovereignty. The participants regarded natural disasters as the root cause of
lower food production and believed that they are compounded by other aspects ranging from a
lack of incentives for production to road infrastructure problems. It was agreed that in order to
secure viable and practical solutions, more reliable information is needed. Measures proposed
include: food quality control; access to producer markets; supervision mechanisms; strengthened
consumer protection; irrigation control to avoid contamination; quality services such as school
breakfasts and subsidized prenatal care; bonds and financial support to microenterprises. It was
also stressed that more support needs to be given to small producers, from land rights and input
provision to training and loans for production and industrialization.
The role of civil society. Participants detected problems with existing public policies, signaling
that many initiatives are isolated and do not meet their mandates. To overcome this and assure
that state food support measures reach the most vulnerable groups, they proposed effective social
oversight. The participants also suggested that more information about food policies, projects
and programs be made available to increase public awareness.
B.
Natural Resource Management and Social Inclusionb
Need for clear policy. Worries exist over the legal reforms directed at the use of, access to and
sustainable exploitation of forest resources. The participants argued that different laws contradict
each other and that clear policies need to be developed to overcome these contradictions.
Furthermore, while some participants believed that after the land rights and titling process
changes started to appear in the consolidation of access rights to forests, others felt the changes
merely exist on paper and have not been transferred into reality. They also identified the
necessity of training in organizational strengthening as well as in adequate management of their
resources to responsibly develop the region. They relayed that little information exists about the
financing received from the international cooperation and the ways in which they invest their
resources, and they called for more vigorous monitoring of investment projects.

Coordination between different levels of government and civil society to address climate
change and secure the sustainable management of natural resources. It was considered that
there is a lack of coordination between government levels and civil society on these issues.
Moreover, local governorates in the Amazon region have not implemented concrete policies to
minimize the effects of climate change and do not promote sustainable natural resource
management. In this regard, the principle proposals were: that all government levels allocate
resources to the prevention and relief of disasters resulting from climate change; encourage
different sectors to formulate agreements and clear regulations regarding the use and sustainable
exploitation of forest resources; a regional platform to raise public awareness about climate
change and; investigations to prevent and mitigate the effects of climate change.
Promoting the sustainable management of natural resources at all government levels.
According to the participants, the promotion of sustainable natural resource management does
not exist. They also considered that the land rights and titling processes in the Northern Amazon
have not managed to prevent conflicts over the use and exploitation of natural resources.
C.
Competitiveness and Productivityc
This event took place in coordination with the Santa Cruz Chamber of Industries, Business,
Services and Tourism (CAINCO) and discussed how to increase competitiveness in the country.
External markets. Many participants signaled that the government should decide upon what
activities they will promote, from small rural peasant enterprises, to medium or large size firms.
They considered that the search for markets should be a joint effort between private firms and the
public sector, but that the World Bank should also support.
Legal security. The country’s lacking legal security and the need for a new investment law were
discussed. Participants also signaled that they should be included in the discussion of new laws.
Food sovereignty and security: Private firms in the agricultural sector signaled that the
biotechnology and transgenic route must be taken to develop agriculture however there was a
lack of understanding over how the government will handle this issue. They also raised that
INRA does not adequately resolve land rights and title issues and identified contradictions with
the Forest and Land Authority’s (ABT) policies, where at the same time ABT looks to reforest
eroded zones and increase agricultural production, shrinking the area for reforestation programs.
II. The Voices of Women in the Strategy
A specific space was created to hear the voices of Bolivian women. The voice and active
participation of more than a hundred women from various sectors in both urban and rural areas
was crucial. These women’s workshops highlighted that the challenges of development cannot
be confronted without the participation of women.
Women and the new autonomy process. The participants discussed the absence of a gender
focus in the Autonomy Statutes and Charters and argued that they do not include the agenda of
c

76

women. Furthermore, they posed a series of challenges to increasing the participation of women
in these autonomy statutes and charters as well as in municipal development plans and budgets.
The participation of women in sustainable development. The women argued that the
country’s strategic resources should be used to ensure national food security, emphasizing that
food products should be produced and bought nationally. They believed that the government
should provide more support to productive sectors to bring production costs down and to enable
Bolivia to compete with its neighbors. The need for rural producers, particularly rural women
producers, to better organize themselves was also addressed, as was the need for producers to
receive training and gain qualifications to secure sustainable change. The Amazonian women
highlighted that women have to be active in decision making; they represent half of the
population and need to participate in decisions that affect them.
III. Consultations with the development cooperation
Three consultations were held with the international development community. These
consultations provided the opportunity for the Bank to see where others perceive its comparative
advantage and how to better coordinate efforts amongst development donors.
The international community highlighted that the Bank should continue support towards the full
implementation, as appropriate, of the Paris Declaration. They showed general support for the
strong focus on sustainable productive development and stressed the need to have a stronger
focus on urban productivity due to Bolivia’s rapid migration trend. The participants expressed a
desire to know more about Bank experiences in rural development and for better coordination.
The importance of the Bank in terms of its capacity to be able to introduce new environmental
instrument such as “Green Accounting” and payment for environmental and the important role it
could play in promoting private sector investments were highlighted. Finally, the participants
perceived the regional PEFAs as an important and strategic support to Bolivia. Several donors
expressed an interest in coordinating and supporting this process.

Bolivia is one of the biggest beneficiaries of
development aid in Latin America. Aid from
the international cooperation represents about
10 percent of Bolivia’s GDP and 28 per cent
of its public investment budget (Figure 1).
Despite dependence on external resources
having fallen since the 1990s, coordination
between donors and with the Bolivian
authorities is still necessary.

The Vice-Ministry of Public Investment and
International Resources
National Resources
External Financing (VIPFE), part of the
Source: INE, Anuario Estadístico 2009
Ministry of Development Planning (MDP),
handles the donor community in Bolivia. VIPFE is responsible for the identification and efficient
and rational routing of donor resources, technical cooperation among developing countries, and
promoting relations between the international cooperation and the Government. The Government
has developed an action plan to improve the effectiveness of development cooperation, based on
three axes: (i) effectiveness of aid, management and outcomes, (ii) capacity development on
technical assistance, and (iii) regulatory framework.
The CAF has the greatest presence in Bolivia, followed by the IADB and the World Bank
(Figure 2), and transactions with these three agencies represent approximately 75 percent of total
external public financing. Bilateral financing represents less than 25 percent of external
assistance and the percentage of assistance from traditional bilateral partners has diminished.
Venezuela and Brazil are now the major bilateral cooperation partners (Figure 3).

To strengthen harmonization between international donors, in December 2006 the Partners
Group for the Development of Bolivia (GruS) was created. The GruS includes all traditional
bilateral and multilateral agencies, and has a rotating chair and coordinating and facilitating
team. The GruS has agreed on a work plan with the MDP and the majority of members have
aligned their cooperation to the National Development Plan and are working towards the
implementation of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Action Plan.
In recent years development aid has been directed towards operations in the transport, water,
agricultural, communications, education, energy and multisectoral sectors. Aid to the transport
sector has increased considerably. The water and sanitation, agricultural and multisectorial
sectors are strongly supported by multilateral donors with some assistance from bilateral
partnersojects are carried out largely on concessional terms or donations. International
cooperation in the education sector is mainly composed of donations.
