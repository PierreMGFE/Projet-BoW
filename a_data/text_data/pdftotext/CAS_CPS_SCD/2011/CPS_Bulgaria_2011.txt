COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR 2011-2013
THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA
Executive Summary
i.
Bulgaria has come a long way from its turbulent political and economic transition in
the 1990s to become a member of the European Union in January 2007. Today, it is an upper
middle-income economy of 7.6 million people and a GDP per capita of $6,423 in 2009.
ii.
Until the onset of the crisis in 2009, Bulgaria enjoyed rapid GDP growth. Sound
macroeconomic policies and deep structural reforms helped fuel growth with average GDP
growth exceeding 6 percent per year during 2004-2007, reaching 6.2 percent in 2008. The global
financial crisis and the downturn in the US and the EU had a severe impact on Bulgaria. In 2009,
growth declined by 4.9 percent and remained almost flat for 2010.
iii. Buffers accumulated during good times helped mitigate the impact of the crisis. Fiscal
surpluses accumulated during 2004-2008 were saved into a fiscal reserve account. Total public
debt declined by half during this period to 15.5 percent of GDP. Thus, when fiscal revenues
worsened in 2009 and 2010, Bulgaria relied on domestic sources to finance emerging fiscal
deficits. Growth started to recover in 2010, aided by recovering external demand, and Bulgaria’s
medium-term outlook is positive, with growth expected to accelerate to 3.5 percent by 2013.
iv. Bulgaria’s current macroeconomic framework is adequate but risks remain. These
include slower economic recovery among trading and investment partners, additional financial
shocks resulting in higher interest rates and tighter global financial conditions, and energy price
increase. High indebtedness of firms is also a source of concern. However, these risks are
mitigated by Bulgaria’s solid track record of fiscal discipline and ongoing fiscal consolidation
reforms, as well as a well capitalized banking sector, and the large share of intracompany loans in
the private external debt.
v.
On the political front, there is broad support across the spectrum around key
institutional, economic and monetary building blocks. Upon taking office in 2009, the Prime
Minister formed a single-party minority government with promise of reforms and faster EU
convergence, with a focus on reducing corruption, unfreezing suspended EU funding, and
improving quality of public services. No government has been elected for two consecutive terms
since the political change in 1989, but all leading parties have expressed full support for the
currency board arrangement, EU convergence, and reforms to join the EU’s exchange rate
mechanism, a pre-requisite to Euro-entry.
vi. Accelerating EU integration and convergence of living standards are Bulgaria’s key
medium-term goals. Bulgaria’s 2011-2015 National Reform Program maintains an overarching
focus on boosting competitiveness to achieve the Europe 2020 Strategy. Its four key priorities
include better infrastructure, competitive youth, the best business environment in the EU, and
higher confidence in state institutions. In addition, the Government has identified the efficient
utilization of EU funds as a major opportunity to finance public investments and accelerate EU
integration.
vii. In recent years, Bulgaria has seen slower than anticipated absorption of EU grant
funds. More than three years after EU accession, Bulgaria has only absorbed about 11 percent of
the €6.7 billion of Structural and Cohesion Funds in the current programming cycle of 2007-

(i)

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
2013. It also stands lose some €200 million in unutilized pre-accession funds which expired in
end-2010.
viii. The objective of this Country Partnership Strategy is to support Bulgaria in
strengthening institutions and policies to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
The CPS is uniquely focused on Bulgaria’s European agenda and is anchored in the National
Reform Program to implement the Europe 2020 Strategy of smart, sustainable and inclusive
growth. The CPS also reflects the Government of Bulgaria’s expressed interest in World Bank
support to boost EU funds absorption, with a focus on transport and water sectors.
ix. To achieve this objective, this CPS proposes a three-pillar framework of support. The
first pillar will aim to provide knowledge and advisory support for policy reforms to implement
select areas of the National Reform Program. Under the second pillar, the Bank will seek to
deliver knowledge and advisory support to strengthen institutions and capacity to accelerate EU
funds absorption. The third pillar envisages complementary and selective provision of financing.
In addition, the Bank’s existing portfolio of lending operations is being re-aligned to expand
support for Bulgaria’s EU funds absorption priority.
x.
It is the aim that knowledge and advisory services will increasingly be provided
through fee-based service arrangements, currently under discussion with the Government
and the European Commission. These fee-based services would focus on sector strategies and
strengthening institutional capacity in the areas of transport, water, social inclusion and energy
efficiency, among others, to improve EU funds management and implementation in the current
financing cycle of 2007-2013. They would scale up World Bank-financed knowledge and
advisory services and also support preparation for the next financing period of 2014-2020. Given
limited World Bank resources, the Government and the World Bank have explored options for
support to be financed through the institution-building and technical assistance resources under
the EU Structural Funds. The provision of these fee-based services is subject to an agreement
between the Government, European Commission and international financial institutions on the
modalities for their financing through EU funds. In sum, this CPS proposes a new business
paradigm, tailored to Bulgaria’s unique challenges within the European context: it consists of a
large program of knowledge and advisory services, intended to be increasingly delivered through
fee-based services, complemented by a modest lending program.
xi. The World Bank’s modest financing support will concentrate on complex reforms and
on activities which are not eligible for financing through grant resources under the EU
Structural Funds or lending by European institutions and international financial
institutions. A railway sector reform package composed of a series of three development policy
loans, and an investment loan to support railway infrastructure maintenance are included within
the indicative lending plans. Given Bulgaria’s priority of utilizing limited fiscal resources
efficiently, the Bank is offering support for institutional reforms through an innovative financing
instrument in which disbursements are linked to achievement of agreed results. Non-traditional
instruments such as carbon financing or guarantees may also be considered.
xii. The International Finance Corporation will comprise an important element of the
World Bank Group strategy in Bulgaria. The IFC will focus its private sector investments on
renewable energy and climate change-related infrastructure and industries, social sector private
investments and selectively in agriculture. In the short-term, IFC will address the impact of the
crisis in Bulgaria by supporting the recovery of the private sector and reducing job losses.

(ii)

BULGARIA COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR 2011-2013

The objective of this Country Partnership Strategy is to support Bulgaria’s aspirations to
integrate fully with the European Union and achieve convergence with European living
standards. As such, this CPS maintains a strong focus on Bulgaria making the most of its EU
membership. It aims to partner with Bulgaria in strengthening national institutions and capacity
to meet EU targets and in accelerating the absorption of EU grants funds. The CPS proposes a
program dominated by knowledge and advisory services, envisioned to be increasingly delivered
through fee-based service, complemented by a modest lending program. The scaling up of feebased service is contingent on the finalization of a mechanism that will allow the Government to
partially use EU technical assistance grant funds to complement World Bank financed knowledge
and advisory services. In line with the European-focused framework, the CPS period is aligned
with current EU financing perspective of 2007-2013. At the time of the progress report, the
World Bank Group will determine, in consultation with the Government of Bulgaria, whether this
CPS remains relevant to the following EU financial perspective beginning 2014, warranting an
extension.
I.

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND ACHIEVEMENTS

A. Political Context and EU Membership
1. Bulgaria has come a long way from its early years of political and economic transition
to becoming a member of the European Union (EU) in January 2007. Bulgaria’s difficult
years of transition included a sharp decline in real GDP between 1990 and 1995, and a severe
economic crisis in 1996-1997 spurred a further decline of 15 percent in real GDP and triple-digit
inflation. These developments led to the establishment of the much valued existing currency
board arrangement.1 Buoyed by subsequent sound macro-economic policies and deep structural
reforms, the crisis years were followed by a decade of economic growth with annual GDP growth
rates of over 5 percent, culminating in Bulgaria’s EU accession.
2. A new administration took office in July 2009 after having won decisively the national
elections with the promise of reforms and accelerating EU integration. In contrast to
previous governments that were based on multi-party coalitions, the Prime Minister formed a
single-party minority government based on the relative success of his Citizens for European
Development of Bulgaria (CEDB) party at the elections. CEDB won 39.7 percent of the
proportional vote and a total of 116 out of 240 seats in Parliament. While the lack of a
parliamentary majority may present some risks in the long run, it also allowed the Prime Minister
to appoint a reformed-minded Cabinet with a mandate to implement priority measures to mitigate
the impact of the global crisis on Bulgaria and put the economy on a path of sustainable
convergence with the EU.
3. There is now momentum in Bulgaria to implement structural reforms with emphasis
on regaining public confidence in government with rapid results. The current government is
focused on improving governance and public services, making better use of EU funds, and

Development, Sept. 1999, Volume 36, #3; http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1999/09/gulde.htm

restoring economic growth and net job creation, among others. Joining the Exchange Rate
Mechanism-2 (ERM-2) as soon as possible and subsequently adopting the Euro also remains a
core objective, which underlies Bulgaria’s fiscally conservative approach. Implementing this
agenda is challenging, given fiscal and institutional capacity constraints. At the same time, the
global economic crisis created an opportunity to accelerate reforms with added impetus from
public sentiment and EU support for reforms.
4. Despite pronounced political divisions among the parties represented in Parliament,
there is broad support across the political spectrum around key institutional, economic and
monetary building blocks. No government in Bulgaria has been elected for two terms in a row
since the political changes of 1989. However, all of the leading parties represented in Parliament
since 1997 have expressed full support for the currency board arrangement, for adopting the
acquis communautaire and EU membership, and implementing reforms to join the ERM-2.
Box 1: Bulgaria and the EU: Efforts to Boost Judiciary and Combat Crime and Corruption
When Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007, there were lingering concerns in the European
institutions about the slow pace of progress in judicial reforms, fighting corruption and combating
organized crime. These shortcomings were seen as serious obstacles to the two countries’ ability to
effectively apply EU policies to guarantee the fundamental rights of their people as EU citizens. To help
the newest member states to continue to tackle these problems, the European Commission (EC) introduced
an unprecedented mechanism, the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM), to monitor progress
through bi-annual reports. Six benchmarks were set for judiciary reforms and for tackling organized crime
and corruption. In response to the reports’ findings that Bulgaria was beleaguered by a weak judiciary,
corruption and organized crime, in July 2008, the EC sent Bulgaria a strong signal by freezing some €500
million in financial support through the Structural Funds and withdrew the rights of two Bulgarian agencies
to manage EU funds. When the centre-right government took office in July 2009, it moved quickly to
mend relations with the EU and later that year, the EU unblocked some of the frozen funds. The latest
(February 2011) CVM interim report takes note of progress to date, acknowledges that Bulgaria has
strengthened its prosecution, initiated structural reforms in revenue and customs agencies and started work
on an anti-corruption strategy. But the report calls for “steps to further improve judicial practice and a
continued improvement of the way the judiciary, police and other investigative bodies are structured,
managed and cooperate.” Given the leadership of the EC among partners on governance issues, the World
Bank will only support this area in specific sectors, as requested, such as the work in railways (see
paragraph 89 for an example of the proposed approach to sector governance).

B. Recent Economic Performance and Outlook2
5. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 had a negative impact on Bulgaria. After a
decade of sustained growth, Bulgaria entered into deep recession with GDP declining by 4.9
percent in 2009. Exports fell sharply as recession deepened in Bulgaria’s main trading partners,
while unemployment rose rapidly to 8 percent in Q4-2009 from record low levels of 5.1 percent
in Q4-2008. The investment and consumption boom of the past, which had been the main drivers
of growth, was brought to an abrupt end with the sharp contraction of external financing, mainly
in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI). Investment declined by 33 percent in 2009. As
FDI inflows deteriorated and domestic demand contracted, imports sharply declined, and the
trade gap narrowed and the external current account deficit narrowed to 9.9 percent of GDP in
2009 compared to 23.1 percent in 2008. As the recession deepened, demand for credit faltered as
banks tightened credit conditions and uncertainty increased. Inflation eased to 2.5 percent in

2

World Bank assessments and estimates as of end-January 2011.

2

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
2009 from 12 percent in 2008 as international prices fell and pressures from wage growth
decelerated with declining labor demand in manufacturing, construction, and real estate. These
sectors were severely affected by sharp swings in the global demand and rapid deleveraging.
6. The buffers accumulated during good times helped mitigate the impact of the crisis.
Fiscal surpluses accumulated during 2004-2008 were saved into a fiscal reserve account which
reached 12.1 percent of GDP in 2008. Total public debt (external and domestic) declined by half
during this period to 15.5 percent of GDP. Thus, when fiscal revenues worsened in 2009 and
2010, Bulgaria relied on domestic sources to finance emerging fiscal deficits. Sizable fiscal
reserves and more stringent reserve requirements for banks in Bulgaria than in the rest of the EU
contributed to a buildup of international reserves to 35 percent of GDP at end-2008. Higher
capital requirements for banks and agreements with the parent banks to reinvest bank profits
helped solidify the banking system in times of high volatility in the financial markets.
7. Growth started to recover in 2010 aided by strong external demand. For the first time
since the start of the crisis, GDP grew in Q2-2010 by 0.5 percent year-on-year, with growth
accelerating to 1 percent in Q3-2010. Economic recovery was led by exports which rebounded to
pre-crisis levels by Q3-2010. Improvements in external demand, however, did not translate into
improvements in the domestic demand. Consumption, held back by high unemployment and
tight credit market, contracted in the first three quarters of 2010 while investment continued to
decline, albeit at a slower pace. Manufacturing, trade, and tourism sectors benefitted from the
pick-up in global demand, while construction and real estate, that led growth in the pre-crisis
period, continued to contract. Annual GDP growth remained almost flat in 2010 and is projected
to pick up in 2011 to about 2.5 percent. The Government considers that GDP growth may reach
3.6percent in 2011.
8. Rebound of exports and further weakening of private capital inflows supported
welcome adjustment of external imbalances. The external current deficit narrowed to 1 percent
of GDP in 2010 from close to 10 percent in 2009 as the trade balance fell to historic lows and the
absorption of EU funds rose significantly. Export growth accelerated to some 33 percent yearon-year in 2010, reflecting robust external demand, especially outside the EU, and increased
metal and oil prices. Recovery of imports was less impressive and driven mainly by price
increases. With overseas borrowing by banks and corporations declining, net capital inflows
turned negative in 2010. Corporations were hesitant to borrow from foreign lenders in an
environment of lingering economic activity and uncertainty on the pace of recovery. This kept
net FDI inflows to close to a third of their level a year ago.
9. With cross-border funding from parent banks declining and domestic demand
weakening, credit growth came to a near end while banks’ portfolios worsened, but the
banking system nevertheless remained sound. Credit to the private sector decelerated sharply
from over 30 percent growth in 2008 to only 1.3 percent in 2010. Deposits, mainly from
households, grew steadily, offsetting fully the falling deposits from non-residents. At the same
time, demand for credit faltered and the share of non-performing loans increased from 2.5 percent
in end-2008 to 11.9 percent in end-2010. However, the existing stringent prudential rules have
kept banks well capitalized and liquid. Capital adequacy in Bulgaria in the end of 2010 was 17.5
percent, significantly higher than the required 12 percent in Bulgaria and 8 percent in most EU
countries. The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) further strengthened banking supervision as well
as liquidity monitoring and stress testing of banks—exchange of information with parent bank
supervisors improved and a Financial Stability Unit was established at the BNB.

3

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
10. Fiscal tightening has kept the budget deficit at 3.9 percent of GDP in 2010 on cash
basis. The budget included a freeze on pension and wages and continued optimization of public
administration, a 20 percent cut in central government spending and a 15 percent cut in municipal
spending. Repayment of arrears accumulated in 2009 was advanced, although slowly, and by
end-2010 arrears stood at 0.6 percent of GDP, or half of their level a year ago. Deterioration of
revenues slowed down, aided by modest recovery of imports and intensified tax compliance
measures. As a result, fiscal deficit was contained to 3.9 percent of GDP compared to 4.8 percent
planned initially.
11. Bulgaria is expected to see an acceleration of growth in the medium term. Output is
projected to expand by 2.5 percent in 2011, with growth speeding up to 3.5 percent by 20133.
The positive growth differential that Bulgaria had with the Eurozone dropped markedly in 2009
and 2010, but is expected to rebound in the medium-term. Output growth is expected to come
from improved export prospects and a gradual recovery of domestic demand. Ongoing and
planned reforms4 aimed at upgrading infrastructure, improving the business environment, and
strengthening education and innovation are likely to contribute to enhanced competitiveness of
Bulgarian firms. Sustained improvements in export performance would support easing of labor
and credit markets, and hence help the recovery of depressed private consumption. Investment is
likely to grow in 2011, albeit at a modest rate, as it would be constrained by still low capital
inflows from abroad and tighter lending conditions on the domestic market. Large investments,
already in the pipeline and planned upgrades in infrastructure, financed almost exclusively with
EU Structural Funds, are likely to support recovery of private investment.
12. Inflation is projected to remain at close to three percent in the medium-term.
Maintaining relatively low inflation rates and improving product and labor markets would support
the Government’s goal of entering ERM-2 in the medium-term and subsequent entry in the
Eurozone (thus exiting the currency board arrangement). Inflation is expected to pick up to
around 4 percent in 2011, reflecting global food and energy price shocks, and subside to around 3
percent thereafter.
13. Rapid correction of external imbalances that started in 2009 is likely to slow as the
economy catches up with the rest of Europe. The current account deficit is expected to pick up
to around 3 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012, and reach around 3.9 percent by 2013, in line with
expected gradual recovery of capital flows from abroad. FDI inflows are expected to remain the
primary source of balance of payments financing, while funding from parent banks are likely to
remain constrained by concerns over sovereign debt and financial sector stability in a number of
Eurozone countries. This would lead to gradual reduction of gross external debt. Current and
capital transfers from the EU are expected to increase as absorption of EU Structural Funds
intensifies. Moreover, available large domestic savings support the emerging recovery without
significant recourse to external financing over the medium term.
14. Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue in the medium-term with restructuring of
public spending. The Government’s medium-term fiscal framework envisages reducing the
fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in 2011 and achieving a broadly balanced budget by
2013. The 2011 budget law targets a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP. Achieving the 2011 fiscal

target relies on improved revenue performance—both tax revenues and increased absorption of
EU funds—but also on continued spending restraint. On the expenditure side, fiscal
consolidation measures include containing the rise in wage and pension expenditure, and
strengthening the governance and management of EU-funded projects and health care funding.
15. Total gross external debt to GDP ratio is expected to continue its downward
adjustment from 101 percent in 2010 to 88.8 percent by 2013. Public and publicly guaranteed
external debt is low at 11.5 percent of GDP in 2010 and is expected to remain almost unchanged
by 2013 in line with the planned medium-term fiscal adjustment. General government debt level
(both external and domestic, ESA95 definition) remains with adequate currency, interest and
maturity structure and in 2011 is projected to be one of the lowest in the EU. Private external
debt, which stood at 89.4 percent of GDP in 2010, is expected to decline substantially as the
uncertainty that exists in the Eurozone and global financial markets is also serving to limit the
debt-financing channels that were experienced in the pre-crisis period. Nearly two-thirds of
private sector debt is either inter-company debt or debt to parent banks of Bulgarian subsidiaries.
Inter-company debt accounts for 43 percent of external private debt while banks’ borrowing,
mainly from parent banks and in the form of short-term deposits, represents another 20 percent.
The non-inter-company debt then accounts for about 30 percent of GDP.
16. The continued global deleveraging and sovereign debt problems in some of the
Eurozone countries are likely to constrain and may even reverse parent funding. Continued
financial difficulties of parent banks could exacerbate this risk. There is also the risk that firms
may find it increasingly difficult to service their debts should the economic recovery become
slower than anticipated or subjected to a shock.
17. However, these risks are mitigated by the existing buffers in the banking system and
the composition of the private sector external debt. For example, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has noted in its latest analysis of Bulgaria’s debt sustainability (June 2010) that
existing capital buffers and stricter macro-prudential regulations and supervision are likely to
continue to support the stability of the banking sector. It is the Bank’s assessment that these
conditions remain valid. In addition, parent banks are likely to keep their exposure to Bulgaria as
rates of return, although falling, remain larger than in the Eurozone. The IMF has also noted that
the large gross external reserves, accounting for 36 percent of GDP in 2010 provide comfort in
case the external environment deteriorates. The high levels of cross-border borrowing by banks
observed during the boom years were associated with rapid credit expansion on the domestic
market. This is not likely to be repeated in the medium-term as the global financial system
continues to deleverage. Banks’ external debt has been declining and now stands at 70 percent of
its pre-crisis level and is expected to continue to decline. As foreign capital inflows remain
modest, banks rely on attracting deposits on the domestic market which have fully offset the
decline in foreign financing. Specifically, while interest rates continue to decline, household
deposits have increased every month since end-2008 from €11.3 billion to €13.3 billion at endNovember 2010, reflecting robust confidence in the banking sector. On the non-banking
corporate sector, the rollover risks for intercompany debt, including to parent banks, are mitigated
by the long lasting interest of the foreign investor and the possibility to offer more flexible
repayment terms to its subsidiary or even transform debt into equity.

18. In sum, the current macroeconomic framework is largely appropriate, but risks
remain. The large domestic and external imbalances of the last several years have rapidly
declined, mainly owing to the sharp decline in capital inflows and the recession in 2009. In
addition, the Government is taking further measures to strengthen its public finances and reduce
the fiscal deficit to below the reference value of 3 percent of GDP by 2011, as recommended
through the EU convergence process.5 In February 2011, the Economic and Financial Affairs
Council of the European Union (Ecofin) assessed positively Bulgaria’s progress in correcting the
deficit in 2010 and the measures put in place in the 2011 budget to end the excessive deficit.
Nevertheless, some macroeconomic risks remain, including slower pace of economic recovery
among Bulgaria’s main trading and investment partners and related uncertainty for capital
inflows, additional unexpected financial shocks which could result in higher interest rates and
tighter global financial conditions, and further energy price increase. Domestic risks relate to
imbalances accumulated in the private sector, notably the high indebtedness of firms. As noted
above, however, these risks are mitigated by (i) Bulgaria’s solid track record of fiscal discipline
and ongoing fiscal consolidation reforms; and (ii) well-capitalized and solid level of provisions in
the banking sector.
C. Living Conditions and Demographic Trends
19. Economic and social policies in Bulgaria during the last decade have led to significant
improvements in welfare, but progress in reducing poverty was halted in 2009 due to the
global economic crisis. Despite considerable improvement in welfare nationwide as well as
largely pro-poor growth, some groups have benefitted more than others. As a result, large and
significant disparities still persist. Households felt the crisis primarily through job and wage cuts.
The recession resulted in increased unemployment and underemployment, reversing a decadelong trend and in a reduction of the informal sector earnings. As the crisis bottomed in the first
quarter of 2010, household living standards showed signs of improvements in the second half of
2010. Annex 4 provides a detailed analysis of living conditions before and after the crisis.
20. Like other countries in Eastern and Central Europe, Bulgaria faces a demographic
transition. Bulgaria’s population is expected to shrink by 18 percent, or about 1.5 million
people, between 2000 and 2025.6 This is the second largest population decrease in percentage
points among the former socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union over this period. In addition, Bulgaria’s population is aging rapidly: the share of
population over age 65 is projected to increase from 16 percent in 2000 to 21 percent in 2025, the
fourth-highest in the region. The two potential risks posed by the demographic transition are
reduced economic growth due to fewer labor force participants, and increased pressure on fiscal
balances due to almost inevitable mounting expenses in pensions, health care and long-term care.
D. The Challenge of EU Funds Absorption in Bulgaria
21. Bulgaria is an important beneficiary of the EU’s Cohesion Policy, which aims to
achieve greater economic and social cohesion by transferring resources from more prosperous
to the least developed regions. The main financial instruments to support this policy are the

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
Structural and Cohesion Funds. These grant funds are complemented by national co-financing,
and are intended to finance activities under each member state’s Operational Programs (OP) that
reflect national priorities. See Annex 5 on EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.
22. Under the current EU financial perspective, covering the years 2007–2013,
approximately €6.7 billion in Structural and Cohesion Funds has been allocated to
Bulgaria. These resources represent approximately one-fifth of Bulgaria’s GDP, and in an
environment of fiscal constraints, they present enormous potential for stimulating growth through
public investments.
23. However, more than three years after EU accession, Bulgaria’s absorption of
structural funds remains very low: only 10.9 percent of EU grants have been disbursed under
Bulgaria’s seven OP resources. Absorption rates range from 2 to 25 percent across the seven
OPs. The implementation rate, which takes into account only project-related disbursements and
excludes advance payments made at the beginning of the programming cycle, is even lower.
24. Pre-accession funds totaling €2.7 billion for the 2000-2006 programming period also
remain underutilized after ten years of implementation. Despite significant efforts by the
Government to accelerate activities in 2010, the final year for absorbing pre-accession funds,
implementation rate fell below expectations. Even with the extension of several projects to 2011
and 2012, Bulgaria stands to lose some €200 million of pre-accession funds. Furthermore, some
projects have been marred by irregularities in financial management.
25. Executing EU-financed projects is proving to be a particular challenge. Bulgaria
continues to face problems at the level of project implementation. The low rate of contracted and
disbursed funds can be attributed to project application processes, project preparation, project
evaluation and selection, project implementation at the beneficiary level, as well as legal and
institutional issues. The Government has taken steps to improve capacity, the management, and
absorption of EU funds, including through the appointment of a minister in charge of EU funds
management.

26.

In June 2010, Bulgaria’s Prime Minister requested urgent Bank support in
accelerating the utilization of EU funds, with a focus on transport and water sectors. Of
particular concern was the preparation and implementation of ongoing EU-funded programs and
preparations for the next financing period 2014-20. This request culminated into the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding in August 2010 between the Prime Minster and the World Bank
Group President to step up cooperation in the development of Bulgaria’s infrastructure and
support accelerated utilization of EU funds through technical advice and financial support.
II.

COUNTRY PRIORITIES AND CHALLENGES

A. Government Program and Europe 2020
27. Accelerating convergence to EU living standards is Bulgaria’s key medium-term
goal.7 The CEDB’s program for 2009-2013 emphasizes “the firm commitment of the Bulgarian

Based on the following key strategic Government documents: the Program of the Government of
European Development of Bulgaria 2009-2013; The National Strategic Reference Framework (2007-2013);

8

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
Government to modernize Bulgaria and take the country to a new stage of development, much
closer to the EU standards.” The cornerstones on which the Government builds its strategy to
achieve these objectives are: (i) continued macroeconomic stability based on prudent fiscal
policy; (ii) maintaining the currency board arrangement at the current exchange rate until entry
into the Eurozone; (iii) accelerated structural reforms to improve the productivity and
competitiveness of the economy and efficiency and quality of public services; and (iv) good
governance, transparency, and dialogue with social partners. In addition, the Government sees
the efficient utilizations of EU funds as an opportunity that Bulgaria cannot miss on its path to
accelerated EU integration. The Government thus hopes not only to expedite recovery from the
economic crisis, but also to lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth rates.
Box 2: Europe 2020 Strategy and Bulgaria’s National Reform Program 2011-2015
In March 2010, the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, unveiled the Europe 2020 Strategy
with the goal of emerging from the crisis and stimulating growth by the end of the decade. The new
strategy replaces the Lisbon Strategy adopted in 2000 which failed to transform the EU into globally the
most dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010. Released in the wake of the global crisis, the Europe
2020 Strategy calls on the 27 Member States to concentrate their efforts in three priority areas:
 Smart growth: developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation.
 Sustainable growth: promoting a more resource-efficient, greener and more competitive economy.
 Inclusive growth: fostering a high-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion.
Under the EU's new economic governance arrangements, Bulgaria must present its own National Reform
Program (NRP) and commit to national targets that will contribute to the achievements of the Europe
2020 Strategy headline targets. As part of the European Semester framework, the NRP also allows the EC
and the Council, to conduct surveillance of Member States’ economic policies. Bulgaria’s NRP 201120158 identifies medium term priorities which include:
 Better infrastructure – better connectivity to Europe, sustainable and competitive cities providing for
accessible services and better connectivity to the less developed regions, preservation and
development of the Bulgarian natural, cultural and historical wealth;
 Competitive youth – reducing the share of early school leavers, increasing the number of young
people with higher education, promoting young scientists, and full realization of the potential of
young people in Bulgaria;
 The best business environment in the EU – lowest tax burden for business and households in the EU,
higher employment, more investments (including in R&D and innovations), fiscal stability, and Euro
area membership;
 Higher confidence in the state institutions – efficient judicial system and ensuring the supremacy of
law, protection of the interests of citizens and the business, social justice and security.

28. To accelerate recovery from the crisis, Bulgaria’s National Reform Program (NRP)
maintains an overarching focus on increasing competitiveness to take advantage of economic
recovery both in Europe and globally. It identifies six factors to promote growth and reform
measures. As shown in Table 2, the NRP will rely on financing from EU Structural and
Cohesions Fund through operational programs designed to promote EU convergence,
supplemented by the national budget in addressing these challenges.

8

The National Reform Program 2011-2015 and the Convergence Program 2011-2014, both adopted by the
Government in April 2011, together with the Commission’s assessment and recommendations, will be
submitted for endorsement to the June European Council.

29. The NRP 2011-2015 has translated the broad headline targets under the Europe 2020
Strategy into national targets, reflecting Bulgaria’s own development challenges and
trajectory. Bulgaria’s country-specific targets mirror the EU’s headline targets as show in Table
3 and include similarly ambitious goals such as achieving 76 percent employment rate in the next
decade. Given the uncertainties in the external environment however, the national targets will be
revisited at mid-term and revised as necessary.

B. Smart Growth – Challenges and Government Priorities
Innovation
30. Bulgaria joined the EU at a time when science, technology and innovation activities
had become one of Europe’s main policy priorities. The Europe 2020 Strategy placed
innovation at the forefront of growth strategies and called for stepping up research and
development (R&D) investments. Achieving the 1.5 percent R&D to GDP goal set in the NRP
will nonetheless prove a significant challenge, as Bulgaria currently has R&D spending of 0.49
percent of GDP. But the concept of innovation is much broader than only R&D spending.
Bulgaria has the opportunity to take advantage of the Structural and Cohesion Funds to create a
more innovation friendly environment in its urban centers and beyond. Moreover, strengthening
the knowledge triangle, namely business-universities-research institutes, is much needed in
Bulgaria. More quality research at universities and research institutes could help create innovative
forms of business organization, like knowledge and technology transfer centers and strategic
entry of high-value added sectors/sub-sectors in global value chains.
Education
31. Bulgaria’s education reforms improved efficiency of spending, and focus has now
shifted towards improving access and inclusion, accountability for results and quality of
education Bulgaria’s extensive education reforms of 2007 and 2008 focused on boosting school
autonomy and efficient use of resources. Recent survey results for the Program for International
Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 indicate that the deteriorating trend in quality since 2000 was
reversed. Although the country registered significant performance gains, it lags behind other EU
member states. Within the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy, Bulgaria has set a national target
to reduce the share of early school leavers9 to 11 percent by 2020 (vs. 14.7 percent in 2009) and
increase the share of people aged 30-34 with higher education to 36 percent by 2020 (vs. 27.9
percent in 2009). The Government has set seven priority actions for achieving this target through
adoption of a new legal framework for school and higher education that reforms the educational
structure; introduces stronger quality assurance mechanisms at all educational stages; fosters

11

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
inclusion; improves equity; and gears the accountability system towards performance, heightened
quality of service delivery, and provision of knowledge and skills required for the knowledge
economy. The Government is trying to address these challenges with a new school education
sector law, currently under preparation, and a set of initiatives aimed at improving the legal
framework for higher education.
C. Sustainable Growth – Challenges and Government priorities
Public Administration and Public Finance
32. Bulgaria’s rapid and large increases in public expenditures during the boom years now
require significant adjustment. The Convergence Program 2011-14 and the NRP 2011-15 are
anchored in the Medium-term Fiscal Framework which aims to achieve a general government
deficit of below 3 percent of GDP and increased efficiency and effectiveness of public
expenditures. Fiscal adjustment will rely heavily on rationalization of public expenditures and
public administration reform is focusing on consolidation and on modern public sector that
provides an enabling environment and basic public goods through professionalization of staff and
increased transparency and accountability.
Competitiveness – Business Regulatory Environment
33. Improving business regulation to boost growth is indispensable to Bulgaria’s
commitment to create favorable conditions for business and competitiveness. The NRP set a
priority to improve the business environment, including the functioning of state administration
and increasing the administrative efficiency, and better regulation. The existing regime of state
fees continues to pose a burden on businesses. Predictability and consistency of regulation
remains much lower in Bulgaria compared to the other new EU member states. Bulgaria plans to
address the burdensome regulatory environment and to manage, monitor and control the
implementation of the Better Regulation Program 2010-2013.
Transport – Roads and Rail
34. The Government has made transport infrastructure improvement a top priority to
boost economic competitiveness and achieve sustainable growth. The infrastructure backlog
represents one of the main impediments to accelerating convergence with the rest of Europe. As
a result, some €1.5 billion of financial resources have been allocated under the EU Structural
Funds to support economic recovery, facilitate regional economic integration, and improve
effectiveness of transport. The availability of these EU grant resources presents an unprecedented
opportunity that the Government is keen to make full use of. Hence, effective and efficient
absorption of these EU funds is both a top priority and a challenge for the Government. To
overcome this challenge requires strengthening the road sector’s governance, including policy
and strategy formulation, efficient resource allocation, and building capacity in government
institutions.
35. In the rail sector, despite important reforms in the years leading to EU accession,
Bulgarian railways continue to underperform. They suffer from very low asset and staff
productivity—around one third of the EU’s average productivity. This problem is compounded
by the legacy of an extensive railway network that has yet to be adjusted to current market
conditions. This not only generates high fixed costs to the railway industry making it less
competitive than road transport, but also leads to higher costs to taxpayers. The key challenge for

12

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
Bulgaria is sustaining a railway system of almost the same network density as the EU average,
with one half of the traffic density, one-third of the labor productivity, and four-tenths of the GDP
per person. Like the road sector, the absorption of about €600 million of EU funds available to
railways remains a serious challenge. The combined passenger and freight traffic in 2009 and
2010 contracted by more than 40 percent from 2007 levels. As a consequence, state-owned
companies, the National Railway Infrastructure Company (NRIC) and the Bulgarian Railways
Company (BDZ EAD), have had severe short-term cash problems in 2009 and 2010, including
problems to fund their operations. The Government took action and embarked on a significant
railway reform program. Continuing structural reforms focused on sector governance and on
service delivery performance has become urgent, following the recent crisis, and is necessary to
make railways in Bulgaria a viable and flexible industry.
Green Growth and Climate Action
36. Bulgaria’s economy is the most energy intense in the EU,10 and its energy sector
accounts for nearly 70 percent of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but there is
significant energy efficiency potential in the economy, especially in buildings. Under the
“climate-energy” package of the NRP, Bulgaria has embraced the most important and politically
visible European climate action target of at least 20 percent reduction in GHG emissions from
1990 levels by 2020. In addition, it set its own national target of increasing energy efficiency by
25 percent by 2020, complemented by a 16 percent renewable energy target. Energy efficiency
improvements, especially in the buildings sector, are a key area for the use of EU Structural
Funds. Bulgaria’s primary energy mix is balanced between domestic coal, crude oil, natural gas
and nuclear energy. Energy import dependency is at about 52 percent, which is especially high
for natural gas. Several options are being pursued to address security of supply, focused mainly
on long-term solutions which would bring diversified gas supplies to the country, but a strategic
framework and clear policy is yet to be further developed.
37. While implementation of a GHG mitigation strategy and energy efficiency action plan
is underway, a number of areas need strengthening. These include: (i) methodologies for
estimating energy savings and audits; (ii) monitoring and reporting requirements; (iii) incentive
schemes; and (iv) strengthening the capacity of central agencies and local government staff. In
addition, Bulgaria’s capacity to participate in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and
take advantage of other carbon markets needs significant strengthening. Bulgaria is also highly
vulnerable to climate change, and does not have a strategy or an adequate institutional capacity to
respond. A National Plan for Climate Change Actions is to be elaborated by 2012. Like many
other countries, Bulgaria faces in the medium term the risk of significant increase in mean annual
temperature, drop in mean annual precipitation and an overall occurrence of more extreme
weather patterns. Climate sensitive sectors (water, agriculture, forestry) would be particularly
impacted, further taxing the country’s economy.
Environment, Water, and Agriculture
38. Bulgaria’s water resources are at risk from climate change and the sector’s
management is in need of both significant reforms and investment. This sector is also
constrained by the comparatively low absorption rate of EU Structural Funds allocated to
Operational Program Environment. Similar to other sectors such as transport, important

European Communities, 2010,: page 50

13

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
implementation bottlenecks exist, in particular the need to enhance: (i) administrative capacity
both at central and local levels; (ii) project management structures and skills; (iii) preparation of
project pipelines; and (iv) quality assurance in the project preparation and management. The
Government is currently preparing a water resources strategy, including a strategy for water
supply and waste water, and is committed to significantly increase investments in water and
waste water infrastructure.
39. The contribution of agriculture to sustainable growth and income generation is below
potential, despite significant public expenditure and access to EU funds. Land ownership is
fragmented and highly polarized, with 75.4 percent of holdings cultivating only 6.6 percent of the
agricultural area, and 0.8 percent of holdings cultivating 78.5 percent in large farms. EU
payments for farmers benefit only a little more than one-quarter of the agricultural population,
and the emergence of competitive intermediate farms faces multiple obstacles. In addition, while
agriculture in Bulgaria uses two-thirds of the country’s water resources, the irrigation (hydroamelioration) infrastructure is large and in need of better maintenance, due mainly to the lack of a
regulatory framework clarifying both ownership and use rights. Moreover, there is an urgent need
for the elaboration of a new “code for agricultural land use” to support land consolidation and
help prepare Bulgaria for the next round of discussions on the EU Common Agricultural Policy.
D. Inclusive Growth – Challenges and Government Priorities
Social Inclusion - Roma
40. Poverty and other challenges faced by vulnerable groups including the Roma
population are a priority issue for the EU. The multidimensional roots of Roma poverty, the
diversity of Roma communities, and the European context suggest important policy implications.
Bulgaria, as an active participant in the Roma Decade 2005-2015, has been implementing over
the last decade, various strategies and programs with a focus on Roma. However, Bulgaria is now
placing emphasis on the implementation of a truly integrated approach that can simultaneously
address multiple causes of poverty and the significant economic benefits to improved inclusion.
World Bank analysis indicates that productivity gains could reach an average of €2,412 per year
for each working age Roma in the country. Bulgaria will redraft its strategy for Roma inclusion
by the end of 2011, to tackle policy areas where Roma vulnerability is particularly acute:

Employment: The difficulty Roma face in accessing and reentering the labor market is a
main contributor to poverty. Long-term unemployment, in addition to leaving people in
poverty, leads to a psychology of dependence on social benefits, which makes reentry into
the labor market even more difficult.

Education: There are barriers that prevent Roma children from completing school and are
oftentimes responsible for the intergenerational circle of poverty.

Health care: Relative to the other policy areas, much less is known about health issues
facing Roma communities, highlighting the need for better monitoring. Improving access,
and better prevention and promotion are important elements of support programs.

Housing: Housing is a complex sector that requires close coordination between
governments and communities. Effective legislation and enforcement mechanisms are
needed to prevent housing discrimination and clarify property ownership.

Social assistance: Safety net programs that provide cash assistance to the poor are an
important source of income for many Roma families. Continued effort is needed to make
them more effective in reaching the poor, without discouraging those who are working.

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
Social Protection - Pensions and Labor Markets
41. Without continued reforms, the pension system could pose fiscal risks and barriers to
Bulgaria’s growth. Bulgaria’s Convergence Program 2011-2014 presents the long-term
parameters of pension reform, which will support the current consolidation plans and ensure the
long-term sustainability of public finances. These reforms will address on the one hand
consolidation and stabilization of social security revenues and on the other hand, seek to improve
adequacy of pensions and tackle demographic challenges. Bulgaria’s recently enacted phased
changes to the pension system (the first wave of these changes became effective in January, 2011)
was designed to improve the sustainability of the system, which consumes about 40 percent of
public expenditure. These changes include increases in contribution rate and the required years
of contributions, raising the retirement age starting in 2021, and a rise in contribution rate for
individual accounts (second pension pillar) from 5 to 7 percent in 2017. Pension ceilings will
gradually rise for pensioners and will be eliminated for new pensions starting 2014.
42. Labor market participation is still low, and significant skills mismatch still exists
between unemployed labor and the needs of the market. In labor markets, the education
reform program is expected to contribute to a long-term rise in quality of the labor force. In the
shorter term and as envisioned in the NRP, the Government anticipates making substantial
investments in: enterprise-based training that will increase opportunities and reduce
unemployment especially for the young; required training for the registered unemployed;
assistance for those outside the labor force to reenter; modernization of public employment
services into “one-stop shops”; more opportunities using publicly financed vouchers for life-long
skills development for both the employed and unemployed; and the social inclusion efforts cited
above to improve participation of disadvantaged and ethnic groups.
Health
43. The health sector will consume 11.9 percent of public spending in 2011, but is still
performing poorly in terms of service efficiency and quality of care. Bulgaria has serious
resource allocation and incentive problems in its health care financing system, most clearly
evidenced by continuous expansion of the inefficient hospital system. The number of hospitals
grew from 298 in 2003 to 351 in 2009, with a concomitant increase in the number of beds, while
Bulgaria’s population dropped by 300,000. The need for additional budget consolidation in the
future has led the Government to define measures for raising the financial independence of the
health sector, as indicated in the upcoming Convergence Program 2011-2014 and NRP 20112015, in particular through introducing rules and methods for estimating costs of medical
activities, and the development of e-health and rules for financial management and reporting of
hospitals. Additional measures are also planned, including implementation of a new national
health map and the introduction of diagnostically-related groups as a payment method to
hospitals. However, further efforts are needed to resolve the systemic issues.
44. In Bulgaria, there is gender parity in health and education, yet women’s economic
participation and opportunity remain considerably lower than men’s.11 For example,
women earn only 55 percent of what is earned by men doing similar work, and their average
salary is 16 percent lower than men’s. Thus eliminating the gender gap is important in terms of

11

In the 2010 Global Gender Gap report, Bulgaria ranks lowest among upper middle-income countries in
terms of gender parity.

15

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
achieving equity and social inclusion, but it is equally important in terms of boosting Bulgaria’s
competitiveness—the overarching focus of the NRP.
III.

BULGARIA-WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP

A. Experience and Lessons Learned
45. The FY07-FY10 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS),12 launched prior to EU accession,
focused on facilitating Bulgaria’s economic and
social integration with the EU. During this period,
Bulgaria’s development agenda shifted from meeting
EU accession criteria to accelerating convergence
with EU living standards.
These priorities
underpinned the design of the CPS which centered on
supporting Government efforts to boost productivity,
generate jobs, improve fiscal efficiency and
absorption of EU grants, as well as foster social
inclusion.
Four investment operations and one
supplemental financing operation entered the portfolio
in the last CPS. In addition, a series of three
Development Policy Loans (DPLs) supported
structural reforms in health care, education, social
inclusion and labor markets, aligned with the
Government’s prudent fiscal stance.
Net
commitments between FY07-FY10 totaled US$ 1.1
billion equivalent.13

Results at a Glance
World Bank Group support during the FY0710 CPS contributed to important results.
More than 700,000 people benefited from
small social infrastructure improvements and
services on the municipal and community
levels (Social Investment and Employment
Promotion Project).
Improvements in revenue administration and
strong economic growth contributed to an
increase in tax and social contribution
revenues by 4.6 percentage points of GDP
between 2002 and 2008, the highest revenue
gain among new EU member states (Revenue
Administration Reform Project).
Turnaround times for registering a real estate
transaction and mortgage, and for cadastre
map services were reduced from seven days to
a single day (Registration and Cadastre
Project).

46. The proposed lending program was largely on track in terms of lending volume, albeit
with delays and minor adjustments. In agreement with the Government, the CPS was based on an
indicative annual lending of approximately $300 million. Lending in FY07 slightly exceeded this
figure but planned lending for FY08 was pushed to FY09 and FY10, which resulted in $409
million being delivered in FY09 and $119 million in FY10. The reasons for the delays were
twofold. First, Bulgaria was constrained by limited institutional capacities in the early years of
EU accession due to increased demands on policy formulation and coordination with the EC and
EU partners. Second, the Government had to focus on creating institutions and procedures to
absorb EU funds which diverted their attention from non-EU related priorities and delayed
project preparation. The global financial crisis also led to unforeseen fiscal constraints,
prompting the Government and the Bank to revisit priorities in the portfolio.
47. Portfolio performance was consistently satisfactory during the CPS period until FY10
when cuts in public investment resulted in a slower pace of implementation. The portfolio
consisted of 14 operations, including two Global Environment Facility (GEF) grants.
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) review of five operations that closed during the last CPS
confirmed the satisfactory ratings. In 2010, two projects saw their ratings downgraded due to
slow implementation progress, and the Government has since stepped up efforts to bring portfolio
performance on track.

13

The previous CPS originally covered the period FY07-FY09, but was extended FY10.
Includes 7 projects which were active from the FY03-FY05 CAS

16

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
48. A solid, front-loaded Analytical and Advisory Activity (AAA) program was a central
feature of the previous CPS, which supported a strong policy dialogue and informed the design
of lending programs. During FY07-FY10, some 20 products were delivered, providing advice in
core policy areas such as accelerating convergence with the EU, increasing the competitiveness of
Bulgaria’s economy, restructuring of public expenditures to boost economic growth, and fiscal
sustainability. As a result, when a new government took office in July 2009, the Bank was well
positioned to deliver a series of policy notes to the incoming cabinet, highlighting challenges and
policy options across 16 sectors—including railways, forestry, pensions, and public finances.
49. During the last CPS period, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) supported 6
projects with total commitments of US$ 371.9 million. The single biggest investment lies in
the field of renewable energy in the form of a loan for the construction of Bulgaria’s largest wind
park. In line with IFC’s strategic goals for Bulgaria, IFC has supported a company investing in
agricultural land and promoting land consolidation. In the financial sector, IFC supported one
specialized bank for small and medium enterprises (SME) and invested in a venture fund
targeting the SME sector. In other industries, during the last CPS period, IFC also contributed to
key manufacturing projects in the country─it supported the modernization and capacity increase
of a large steel mill and one glass processing plant. Through these investments, it has been
supporting environment-friendly technologies.
50. Overall performance of the FY07-FY10 CPS program is rated moderately
satisfactory. The program achieved substantive progress toward two important CPS outcomes—
education and labor reforms—which were priorities on the national agenda and enjoyed strong
ownership by the Government. Education and labor reforms were also at the heart of the SIR
DPL series, the centerpiece of the CPS. In education, the CPS supported Bulgaria’s efforts to
introduce extensive reforms in financing and school assessments, which contributed to positive
results in enrollment and student performance. Labor market dynamics were also significantly
enhanced with the introduction of a more flexible labor code and stronger employment incentives
in social assistance, which helped reduce the number of Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI)
beneficiaries in a period of economic growth.
51. The CPS program, however, made limited progress toward stabilizing public
spending on health and increased absorption of EU funds. The difficulty of health reforms
such as hospital rationalization was underestimated and looming elections in 2009 delayed action.
Nevertheless, the CPS program did lay the foundation for future reforms and the Government
recognizes the importance of advancing health reforms. In terms of EU funds absorption, public
sector and institutional capacity constraints emerged as the primary obstacles to the preparation
and implementation of projects for EU financing, and these were not adequately addressed during
the CPS period.
Lessons Learned
52. The CPS could have better taken into account Bulgaria’s capacity constraints and
scaled back on design and delivery. While the quality of projects implemented during the CPS
period were satisfactory, the delivery of some projects experienced delays. These delays can be
attributed, among other factors, to limited institutional capacities exposed in the first year of EU
accession which brought for Bulgaria substantially increased demands on policy formulation and
coordination with the EC and EU partners. Bulgaria also gave priority to setting up EU related
institutional structures—possibly delaying World Bank project preparation designed to support
Bulgaria in the absorption of EU funds.

17

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
53. The CPS could have benefited from a more targeted program to address Bulgaria’s
capacity and institutional constraints to meet the EU funds absorption goal. The previous
CPS included modest interventions in two projects to provide technical assistance in preparing
projects eligible for EU grant financing. The CPS underestimated the extent of institutionbuilding required to achieve this objective, and focused more attention on creating fiscal space.
By the end of the previous CPS period, Bulgaria continued to underspend its EU grant allocation.
Addressing institutional and capacity constraints have since emerged as a top priority for both the
Government and EC, and the Government’s fiscal plan is now aligned with the EU funds
absorption objective. Drawing on the lessons from the previous CPS, the 2011-2013 CPS places
institutional and capacity building at the heart of the program, with ongoing and proposed
activities designed to reflect the EU funds absorption priority.
54. In EU member states with access to significant EU grant funds, the Bank is better
placed to support policy reforms aligned with EU priorities and strengthening country
capacity and institutions. The Bank’s value-added was clearly perceived to be in the area policy
reforms and institutional strengthening rather than financing. Future World Bank lending in
Bulgaria should serve as complementary financing in areas where no EU funds are available or
where Bank financing is leveraging other resources or fostering innovation.
55. Reforms in Bulgaria need clear demonstration of commitment and ownership before
underpinning such reforms with financing. The Bank contributed in significant ways to the
debate on reforms in Bulgaria, but has not always waited for clear signs of commitment before
proceeding to support such reforms. In education, for example, there was a strong response to the
proposals for reform, which were implemented with success. In the health sector, in contrast,
there was little evidence of commitment to the reforms supported in the DPL program, and there
was little progress in this sector.
CPS Consultations
56. CPS features were the subject of focused discussions with the Government on the
future World Bank Group program and consultations with key national and international
stakeholders. In meetings with representatives of think tanks, political parties, civil society
including Roma organizations and private sector umbrella organizations, the evolving role of the
World Bank Group in Bulgaria was discussed. National stakeholders voiced a commonly shared
view that the Bank Group’s value-added is its global and regional knowledge and expertise. This
knowledge and expertise should contribute to structural reforms in key sectors and lead to
increased absorption of EU funding. While knowledge is perceived as the centerpiece of the
evolving partnership, several stakeholders emphasized the need for complementary World Bank
financing to support design and implementation of sector reforms. These views were echoed by
international partners. The CPS was prepared in close collaboration with the EC, in particular the
Directorate General for Regional Policy, which manages a large share of EU funds. The
European Investment Bank (EIB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
as well as EU ambassadors were also engaged in the CPS dialogue.
B. CPS Principles of Engagement
57. Complementarity. Bulgaria is seeking to maximize the quantitative and qualitative
benefits of EU membership, including effective utilization of EU grant funds. The CPS will
ensure complementarity with activities supported by European institutions and instruments.
Government programs are closely aligned with the EU programming period. Therefore, the
World Bank Group will align the CPS cycle with the current EU planning and financing cycle

18

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
(2007-2013). This will allow the CPS to capture the second part of the current EU programming
cycle as well as the important strategic planning and preparatory phase for the next (2014-2020)
financing period.
58. Flexibility. The Bulgarian authorities also emphasized the need for flexibility because
of (i) the continued uncertainty as the global economy recovers; (ii) the rapid evolution of the
economy as Bulgaria catches up with the rest of the EU, and related required structural changes;
and (iii) the fact that the timing and sequencing of critical reforms and their ultimate success is
not only subject to technical considerations, but must also take into account the political
economy, and thus requires flexible change management by Government. Therefore, the CPS
does not attempt to define a program through 2013. Rather, future activities will be determined
by the criteria of the three pillars articulated in Section III-C of this document, as well as
Government priorities, the Bank’s capacity to respond, and the value-added of proposed Bank
support.
59. Knowledge and Innovation Partnership. The Government of Bulgaria has expressed
interest in forging a knowledge partnership based on innovation. This enables Bulgaria to
tap into the Bank’s global and regional experience, and as well as knowledge and advisory
services based on detailed Bulgaria country and sector knowledge. While the World Bank Group
will provide global and regional knowledge and good practice in a tailored manner, it will also
innovate and learn with and from Bulgaria for the benefit of other countries.
C. CPS Pillars of Engagement and Outcomes
60. World Bank Group support will be anchored in Bulgaria’s National Reform
Program to implement the Europe 2020 Strategy. The objective of the CPS is to support
Bulgaria in strengthening institutions and policies to achieve smart, sustainable, and
inclusive growth. These objectives are closely aligned with the World Bank’s three strategic
priorities for the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region, which focuses on competitiveness,
inclusion and climate change. CPS activities are organized under three pillars: (i) knowledge and
advisory support for policy reforms to implement the NRP; (ii) knowledge and advisory support
to strengthen institutions and capacity to accelerate EU funds absorption; and (iii) complementary
and selective provision of financing. Table 4 organizes ongoing activities and those under
discussion for FY11-12 according to the Europe 2020 goals of smart, sustainable and inclusive
growth.
61. Knowledge and advisory services are envisioned to be increasingly provided through
fee-based service arrangements. The Government and the World Bank have explored the
possibilities of procuring the Bank’s knowledge and advisory services by utilizing EU Structural
Funds. In close coordination with the European institutions (EC, EIB) and IFIs (EBRD and the
World Bank), the Government is currently developing a mechanism for significantly scaled-up
technical support for increased EU Funds absorption. Such support would selectively aim to
engage with Bulgaria in the preparation and implementation of its investment programs funded
from EU Structural Funds in areas where the World Bank can provide value-added and can
respond in a timely manner. For the Government, the principal rationale for a fee-based service
program with the World Bank is to achieve more efficient and effective absorption of large
volumes of EU funds, while leveraging the Bank’s global knowledge and experience.

62. World Bank knowledge and advisory services would focus on policy reforms, sector
strategies and strengthening institutional capacity for increased EU funds absorption. This
support would be fully complementary to technical assistance provided by other partners,
including EIB and Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions (JASPERS), under
the coordinating leadership of the Government. In addition to EU Structural Funds, European
Economic Area and Norwegian grant funds constitute potential options for the Government to cofinance and scale up World Bank knowledge and advisory work in NRP areas not directly related
to EU funds absorption.
63. Activities within the ongoing lending portfolio from the previous CPS are being
realigned to support Bulgaria’s EU funds absorption priority. The ongoing portfolio
covering the roads and water sectors is being aligned to the Government objective of increasing
EU funds absorption, including strengthening institutional capacities. For example, the
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (MIDP) includes a component that will assist the
preparation of regional water and wastewater master plans to identify priority investments and

20

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
plan for EU grant financing through the Operational Program Environment. Similarly, the Road
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project is being restructured to include a component that will support
preparation of projects for EU Structural Funds financing under the current EU financing cycle,
and develop a pipeline for funding under the next financing cycle (2014-2020).
64. The CPS results matrix will remain a dynamic tool to define and monitor outcomes
and milestones. The results matrix in Annex 1 currently captures ongoing activities, new
activities agreed upon with the Government as well as potential activities under discussion for
FY11-FY12. The proposed results are contingent on the World Bank’s ability to launch the feebased services through the mechanism being finalized by EC, the Government and IFIs. Given
the demand-driven and flexible architecture of the CPS, the results matrix will be adapted to
reflect the implementation status of fee-based services, as well as additional World Bank Group
activities in the coming years. Annual program review and planning meetings will be held in the
Spring, to coincide with the Government’s annual review of the NRP.

(i) Pillar I: Policy Reforms for National Reform Program to Implement Europe 2020
Strategy
65. Through the first pillar of engagement, the World Bank will provide knowledge and
advisory support on policy reform in select sectors and themes of the NRP. The World Bank
has already produced a series of analytical work related to Bulgaria’s NRP priorities during the
previous CPS period, and it will continue this support, driven by Government demand and
priorities. A key outcome supported by this pillar will be annual improvements in Bulgaria’s
NRP as measured by the EC’s assessment of Bulgaria’s submission every year. To achieve this
outcome, activities under this pillar will focus on the specific sectors discussed below.
Innovation


Outcome: Strengthened policies, aligned instruments and effective institutions for high
quality R&D.

66. The NRP targets an increase of public spending for R&D of 1.5 percent of GDP,
combined with increased support for science and innovation. World Bank knowledge and
advisory services will focus on design and performance of the national R&D and innovation
programs and the instruments funded by EU funds under the OP Competitiveness. It is
envisioned that the Government would co-finance World Bank advisory work through a feebased service arrangement. The expected output is to produce detailed diagnoses of the
bottlenecks for absorbing EU funds related to administrative capacity, red tape, project pipeline,
and overall design. Targeted activities that would also contribute to the CPS Pillar II objective of
boosting EU funds are also planned. Substantial redesign and scaling-up of these programs will
be required in the EU’s next programming cycle 2014-2020 to achieve Bulgaria’s target of R&D
investments totaling 1.5 percent of GDP.
Education


Outcome: (i) Improved quality of basic and secondary education by strengthening the
accountability framework; (ii) Improved quality and relevance of higher education
through strengthened governance, accreditation and performance-based funding.

67. The NRP calls for increased participation in primary and secondary education with a
2020 target of school-aged population out of school reduced to 11 percent. As important

21

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
input to the new law on basic and secondary education, ongoing World Bank knowledge and
advisory services are supporting the Government’s efforts to enhance the accountability
framework. This entails working with the Government to refine the school education external
assessment system by improving the technical design, data analysis, use, and dissemination of
results, as well as making the assessment system financially and institutionally sustainable. The
Bank will also support Bulgaria in strengthening the accountability of schools through
establishment of school-based mechanisms that engage communities and parents in school
decisions. In addition, the Bank would work with Bulgaria in identifying effective performance
incentives for high-performing teachers and schools while creating support and improvement
mechanisms for municipalities with high numbers of poorly performing schools.
68. In addition to knowledge and advisory support, the Government is considering World
Bank financing to support implementation of the education sector reform. A new education
sector law is currently under preparation. In order to best support implementation of the sector
reform, potential World Bank financing would be provided through an innovative results-based
operation, linking disbursements with achieved reform implementation results.
69. In higher education, the NRP seeks to increase participation in tertiary education to
36 percent of people aged 30–34 by 2020. Increased participation in tertiary education will
depend on improved quality and relevance of higher education through strengthened governance,
accreditation and performance-based funding─an area where the World Bank will support the
Government through knowledge and advisory services in FY11-12.
Public Finance and Public Administration


Outcome: Improved efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures.

70. Higher confidence in state institutions, improved functioning of state administration
and increased administrative efficiency is one of the key NRP priorities. World Bank
knowledge and advisory services will support the Ministry of Finance (MoF) with
recommendations for further improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures
and in conducting joint analysis of the competitiveness of the economy. World Bank engagement
will also involve public finance policy analysis of select sectors or topics to be agreed with the
MoF through the annual CPS program review and planning.
Competitiveness – Business Regulatory Environment


Outcome: Reduced administrative burden at central and local levels through effective
implementation of the Better Regulation Program and the Administrative Burden
Reduction Action Plan.

71. The NRP aims at creating “the best business environment in the EU.” Bulgaria is
aiming for a 2012 target to reduce the administrative burden by 20 percent through improved
functioning of state administration and increasing administrative efficiency, as well as better
regulation. This will require the implementation of the Better Regulation Program 2010-2013
and Action Plan for Administrative Burden Reduction. Developing a competitive business
environment would improve Bulgaria’s prospects for increased firm productivity, growth and
international competitiveness.
72. The World Bank is providing knowledge and advisory services focusing on improving
the legislative, policy, and institutional set-up at national and local levels to promote better
regulation. It is envisioned that advisory services will be scaled up through fee-based service.

22

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
Building a more competitive business environment will be based on: (i) issuance of a regulatory
impact assessment of important legislation and policies; (ii) applying sectoral applications on
business self-regulation; (iii) identification of regulatory regimes to be eliminated or to limit their
scope; and (iv) conducting surveys among businesses to assess the results of administrative and
regulatory burden reduction initiatives. Additional activities under the planned knowledge and
advisory services will focus on optimization of the administrative systems at the national and
local levels. Outputs will include: (i) implementing the institutional set-up of the authority that
will monitor the implementation of the LARACEA Law; (ii) approving a new regime of state fees
framework (policy, legislation, institutional set-up); (iii) improving other administrative
procedures such as for construction permits, contract enforcement and closing businesses, (iv)
conducting surveys of administrative services of municipalities to assess the results of
administrative burden reductions; (v) completing trainings in regulatory impact assessments to
national and local administrative personnel; and (vi) setting-up and implementing the
Administrative Register.
Green Growth and Climate Action


Outcome: Reduced energy consumption in buildings through scaled-up program to
improve energy efficiency in public and residential buildings.

73. World Bank knowledge and advisory services will support the Government to roll out
a large-scale national program to increase energy efficiency of buildings, in partnership
with EBRD and EIB, by expanding upon and coordinating existing activities and
mechanisms. This will involve setting up an institutional coordination mechanism with key
stakeholders, developing/refining the tools and incentives mechanisms, and identifying financing
sources.
These activities, envisaged to be scaled up through fee-based service, will also
contribute to the second pillar of boosting EU funds absorption by devising mechanisms and
institutional models that allow expansion of the use of Operational Program funds to include
energy efficiency in residential buildings. In addition to evolving energy efficiency support, the
World Bank is currently undertaking a Gas Security of Supply Study to facilitate the preparation
of strategies and action plans to ensure reliable and diversified energy supplies, including an
assessment of investment opportunities and their implications.


Outcome: Improved resilience to climate change and strengthened carbon trading
management.

74. In addition to contributing to an adaptation strategy and action plan, the World Bank
stands ready to support Bulgaria in mainstreaming adaptation to climate risk in two
vulnerable sectors─forestry and agriculture─and institutional strengthening of carbon
trading. In forestry, the World Bank would support forest management reforms to improve fiscal
efficiency and the sustainable management of forest and biodiversity resources. In agriculture,
the World Bank would provide knowledge and advisory services to support its ability to adapt to
climate variability. In carbon trading, the World Bank’s knowledge and advisory services would
contribute to the (i) development of approaches for identifying potential eligible Joint
Implementation projects, consistent with the requirements of the EU Emissions Trading System
(EU ETS); (ii) identification of potential eligible Green Investment Scheme (GIS) projects, and
improvement in evaluation methodologies; (iii) identification of opportunities for emission
reduction from sectors outside the EU ETS (e.g. transport, land use); and (iv) training of staff to
strengthen Bulgaria’s participation in the EU ETS.

23

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
75. The IFC will place strong emphasis on looking for opportunities to support climate
change projects in Bulgaria. Knowledge and advisory services, envisioned to be delivered on a
fee-based service basis, will include working with the Government to create an enabling
environment to increase the role of private sector in growth and sustainable development, while
reducing GHG emissions.
Social Inclusion


Outcome: Increased social inclusion by developing better integrated mechanisms for
inclusion of vulnerable groups, through early childhood development, as well as
increased use of EU funds.

76. The Social Inclusion Project from the Bank’s active lending portfolio will foster social
inclusion by better preparing young children from vulnerable groups─including Roma and
children with disabilities─for successful school education. Because of their social situation,
many vulnerable children reach school age and go to school without the necessary preparation.
They are not on equal footing with their peers and they drop out early from school. The project
will contribute to the sustainability of the school readiness program by supporting the absorption
of European Social Fund (ESF) financing. The Social Inclusion Project also supports the CPS’
third pillar objective of providing complementary financing to EU grant financing.

(ii) Pillar II: Strategies and Institutions to Accelerate EU Funds Absorption
77. Bulgaria has a remarkable opportunity to enhance investment levels and significantly
alter its development prospects through effective utilization of EU funds. EU grant resources
are crucial for co-financing the upgrading of infrastructure and supporting economic recovery,
promoting innovation, and increasing employment and developing the skills needed for a new
knowledge-based economy. The latter is of particular importance since Bulgaria, as a small open
economy with a currency board, is not in a position to conduct its own economic stimulus
program without undermining fiscal discipline and endangering macro-economic stability.
78. Under the second pillar of engagement, the World Bank will provide knowledge and
advisory services aimed at building Bulgaria’s capacity to better absorb, manage and
implement EU Structural Funds. EU funds absorption is not an end in itself, but an important
vehicle for achieving the goal of improved service delivery, especially in infrastructure and
human development, to lay the foundation for sustainable medium-term growth. The
Government inherited the challenge of extremely low absorption of EU funds and, in particular,
mismanagement of the EU pre-accession programs that led to partial suspension of EU funds.
The Government has since regained access to EU funds and made EU funds absorption a top
priority, appointing a Minister for EU Funds to streamline procedures. But weak administrative
capacity presents a significant obstacle as discussed in Section I-D The Challenge of EU Funds
Absorption. A key outcome to be supported by this pillar is to significantly strengthen Bulgaria’s
administrative capacity to utilize EU funds such that absorption is quintupled in the sectors in
which fee-based services specifically designed to boost EU funds absorption (e.g. roads, water
and Roma inclusion discussed below) are launched under a given OP, modulated by the
implementation period.
79. The Government has initiated a coordination process with European and
international partners in key sectors, including road and water infrastructure, to scale up
technical assistance aimed at increasing EU funds absorption. National experts as well as

24

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
experts from the EC, EIB, JASPERS, EBRD and the World Bank reviewed key bottlenecks for
increased EU funds absorption, outlined necessary reforms and institutional strengthening in the
respective sectors and agreed to a division of labor. In parallel, the Government is in discussion
with the EC on a mechanism that will enable Bulgaria to procure knowledge and advisory
services from IFIs using EU funds. As soon as the modalities for such an arrangement are
finalized, the World Bank will launch knowledge and advisory services in the form of fee-based
service. Three key areas of World Bank partnership for increased EU funds absorption are
discussed below.
Transport - Roads


Outcome: (i) Strengthened roads sector governance, management and EU funds
absorption capacity; (ii) Improved roads and border infrastructure.

80. The World Bank will significantly scale up ongoing cooperation with Bulgaria in the
roads sector through knowledge and advisory services aimed at being provided through feebased service. The proposed program would be implemented over three years and address longer
term sector needs and issues. The overall objectives of the program would be: (i) to improve
efficiency and sustainability of the roads sector; (ii) to strengthen institutional and human
capacity; and (iii) to increase absorption of EU funds in view of the planned large investment in
road infrastructure. To achieve these objectives, World Bank support will focus on three main
activities: (i) review and update of the 2020 roads strategy and sector operational programs; (ii)
hands-on operational support to Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works (MRDPW)
/ Road Infrastructure Agency (RIA) to improve implementation of projects; and (iii) improving
roads sector performance, using the process of EU funds absorption to modernize and enhance
roads sector governance through a review of road management functions and support the
implementation of respective recommendations.
81.
Through two ongoing lending operations, the World Bank will continue its support
in upgrading Bulgaria’s roads and border infrastructure. Under the Roads Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project, the World Bank is building the capacity of the National Roads Agency and
financing investment in the rehabilitation of regional and local roads network with the objective
of expanding access to markets. Under the Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project, the
World Bank is supporting the improvement of border-crossing facilities, and harmonizing and
improving telecommunication and cargo data exchange between railway and customs, hence
facilitating trade by lowering freight and transport cost. These two lending operation also
contribute to the CPS’ third pillar objective of providing complementary financing to the EU.
82.
The IFC will also seek to continue to support the Government in its goal to enhance
access to infrastructure. This will entail knowledge and advisory services on enhancing the
social, environmental and economic benefits of large infrastructure projects with sizeable national
impact and potential for private sector participation. This includes possible support to strategic
restructuring and PPP advice, know-how and expertise. Such advisory services would be
delivered on a fee-based service.
Water


Outcome: Increased EU-financed investments in the water sector through strategic
priority setting, water master plans, and strengthened institutional capacity.

25

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
83.
Consistent with the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive and OP
Environment, the World Bank will provide water sector knowledge and advisory support.
This support, planned to be scaled up through fee-based service, will focus on the development
and implementation of: (i) an overall water resources management strategy, led by the Ministry of
Environment and Water (MOEW); (ii) a water supply and sewerage sector strategy and
legislative changes; (iii) rural water management; and (iv) capacity-building of the water
institutions including strategic management and budgeting, cost recovery mechanisms, tariff
setting, and institutional strengthening of individual utilities.
84.
In terms of financing, the World Bank is supporting the water sector through the
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (MIDP), which supports the Government in
prioritizing and planning for investments in the water sector to be financed from EU funds. The
MIDP also supports the improvement of the reliability and quality of water provision to the
communities in selected settlements through investment in three dams and water treatment
systems (Luda Yana, Plovdivtsi, and Neikovtsi) and in the rehabilitation of the Studena dam.
Social Inclusion - Roma


Outcome: Increased participation of Roma population in society through stepped-up,
integrated, transparent and results-focused national strategy and actions.

85.
Specific policy areas where Roma vulnerability is particularly important include
employment, education, health care, housing, and social assistance. Ongoing World Bank
support for Roma integration in Bulgaria is envisioned to be scaled up through fee-based service
(FBS). It will seek to strengthen policies through coherent multi-sector strategies for Roma
integration; and by developing capacity to design, implement and evaluate effective programs and
projects, especially with EU financing. Knowledge and advisory services will be provided to
develop a Roma inclusion strategy and support its implementation. As a first step, the Bank will
support the Government in bringing Roma stakeholders together for a workshop to map out
country challenges and activities that could be scaled up. This workshop will take place in May
2011 and will precede the EC’s high-level Roma forum in Sofia in June 2011.
86.
The ongoing Social Inclusion Project, which aims to increase school readiness of
children from low-income and marginalized families, also supports increased EU funds
absorption under the Human Resources Development Operational Program. The project
supports the development of and provides initial financing for social programs eligible for
European Social Funds (ESF, a financing category under the EU Structural Funds.

(iii) Pillar III: Complementing EU Financing
87.
Through the third area of engagement, the World Bank Group will provide limited
complementary and innovative financing support to Bulgaria. Given the financing available
through the EU’s Structural and Cohesion Funds (€6.7 billion for the current programming period
2007-2013), EIB (€1.8 billion since 2007) and EBRD (€500 million in 2010), World Bank Group
financing will selectively focus on areas that are not eligible for financing from the Commission
or European institutions. In other words, where EU grants or EIB financing is available, the
World Bank will not provide financing.
88.
Future World Bank Group financial support will be concentrated on financing policy
reforms and results-based operations. Such financing will seek to be innovative in terms of
supporting difficult reforms, focusing on results related to reform implementation, or financing

26

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
innovative private sector activities. Preparation is underway for development policy lending to
support the Government’s ambitious railway reforms and to restructure the Bulgarian railways
sector to place them on a sustainable path on which they can resume new investments and more
effectively absorb EU funding. Given Bulgaria’s priority of utilizing limited fiscal resources
efficiently, the World Bank stands ready to support further institutional reforms to ensure that
constrained public expenditures are achieving maximum results. Such reforms could be
supported by results-based operations, an innovative financing instrument in which disbursements
are linked to the achievement of agreed results.
Transport - Rail


Outcome: Financially sustainable and modernized railways system.

89.
New lending has been agreed with the Government to modernize the railway sector
through a programmatic series of development policy loans (DPL) and one investment loan.
The DPLs will consist of three €80 million operations to support the design and implementation
of railway reforms and to ensure that public financial support to railway infrastructure and
passenger services are consistent with transport market demand, EU transport policies, and
Bulgaria’s prudent fiscal policy. The first DPL, under preparation in FY11, will focus on: (i)
enhancing railway sector governance; and (ii) improve corporate governance, management and
performance of railway service delivery by the two state-owned companies, NRIC and BDZ
EAD, in order to provide value-for-money to the state. Investments that are critical to sustain the
railway sector reform’s impacts, and which are not eligible for funding under EU programs, will
be undertaken under a parallel investment loan. The €70 million Railway Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project will finance the acquisition of infrastructure maintenance equipment for
NRIC to improve the quality and efficiency of railway infrastructure services in Bulgaria.
90.
In addition, complementary World Bank knowledge and advisory services for
increased EU funds absorption in the railways sector will be launched. The Government and
the World Bank are discussing a possible fee-based program for the period 2011 – 2013 in close
coordination with the EC and the other European financial institutions. Such a program would
aim to support the Government in preparing and implementing operational programs
(investments) to be funded under the EU Cohesion Fund and European Regional Development
Fund (ERDF) available for the transport sector in Bulgaria.
D. CPS Program
91.
The CPS program will be reviewed annually and adapted to ensure that World Bank
Group support is in pace with Bulgaria’s implementation of the NRP 2011-2015 in the
context of Europe 2020 Strategy. Activities presented in Table 4 reflect the ongoing program as
well as those activities already agreed upon or under discussion with the Government. At the first
annual program review in 2012, implementation progress and results of ongoing activities will be
assessed and additional activities will be discussed and agreed upon.
92.
A CPS Progress Report will be presented to the Board of Executive Directors. The
Progress Report will assess the strategic direction of the CPS based on results agreed with the
Government and reflected in the results matrix.

27

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

(i) IBRD Program
93.
The World Bank program will consist of substantial knowledge & advisory services,
in response to the Government of Bulgaria’s keen interest in forging a knowledge
partnership focused on innovation. This will consist of a tailored program of World Bankfinanced analytical and advisory services that address Bulgaria’s unique challenges. The CPS
envisions to selectively scale up this knowledge and advisory services program through fee-based
service arrangements, in line with lessons learned from the last CPS and in sectors where the
Bank can apply its global knowledge and country-specific experience to Bulgaria’s benefit.
94.
The knowledge and advisory program will be accompanied by selective World Bank
financing focused on complex reforms and which complement EU financing. In recent years,
Bulgaria has maintained a lending portfolio of $300-500 million. As of January 2011, World
Bank lending commitments stand at $353 million underpinned by infrastructure and social
services operations. A railway reform support financing package composed of a series of three
DPLs and an investment loan complementary to EU funding are included in the indicative
lending program. World Bank potential financial support will be discussed upon the
Government’s request, with priority given to results based lending. Non-traditional instruments
such as carbon financing or guarantees may also be considered.14 Table 5 summarizes the
ongoing and planned World Bank lending program.

Programmatic Railway Sector Development Policy - €80M (under preparation)
Railway Infrastructure Rehabilitation - €70M (under preparation)

IFC: Heavy Industry, Banking & Power Sectors (under discussion)

(ii) IFC Program
95.
In line with the Europe 2020 goals, future IFC financing will support smart,
sustainable and inclusive growth, focusing its private sector investments on renewable energy
and climate change-related infrastructure and industries, social sector private investments and
selectively in agriculture. In the short-term, IFC will address the impact of the crisis in Bulgaria
by supporting the recovery of the private sector and reducing job losses.
96.
In the financial markets, IFC’s strategy is to work with local banks and strengthen
their capacity to provide loans to underserved sectors and products such as trade finance,
agribusiness, and energy efficiency. IFC will consider supporting key banks through funding
and balance sheet strengthening, thus helping maintain liquidity and confidence. IFC will also
support the introduction of new financial products such as structured finance and risk-sharing
facilities.

14

Overall lending support will depend on, inter alia, IBRD lending capacity, demand from other borrowers
and global economic developments.

28

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
97.
In infrastructure, IFC will support public-private partnerships projects and catalyze
FDI. IFC will support new investors in the power sector (generation and distribution) and other
network utilities (water, gas, district heating), thus contributing to Bulgaria’s efforts to further
diversify its energy production sources and supply.
98.
In the real sector, IFC will support local companies to become more competitive in
domestic market and expand in other countries in the region, as well as promote SouthSouth investments to/from Bulgaria. This includes, supporting the rehabilitation and
modernization of post-privatized companies and promote foreign investments to foster
technology transfer for productivity gains.
99.
IFC will selectively support direct investments in agribusiness as well as financial
institutions which provides financing to the agriculture sector, which has been largely
underserved by the financial sector. IFC’s support to this key sector can encourage additional
investment from other financial institutions.
Box 3: IFC Investments Support Land Consolidation in Bulgaria
One of IFC’s strategic investments in Bulgaria is a €15 million equity in Advance Terrafund (Atera), the
second largest land owner after the state listed on the Sofia Stock Exchange.
Bulgaria has about 6.2 million hectares of agricultural land, but the agriculture sector is characterized by
low productivity and limited investment. Land fragmentation, remnant of the post-Soviet era land
distribution, has resulted in low productivity, underdeveloped infrastructure, difficulties to access credit and
for land users to contract with landlords. This is further exacerbated by an aging farmers’ population, with
66 percent of farmers over the age of 55.
Like other transition economies, Bulgaria’s Government has been promoting land consolidation and
modernization of agriculture. This also fits within the EU’s agricultural policy, which generally favors
larger scale, efficient farms, and transitioning away from fragmented crop farming. EU agricultural support
in the form of direct payments will be phased out over a number of years, and farm producers will need
bigger plots (minimum 10 hectares) to comply with the EU financing requirements.
Atera’s business is to acquire small plots of arable land, consolidate them into larger properties and rent
them out to commercial farming companies. Atera has acquired the know-how for land identification,
negotiation and acquisition, and administrative and legal consolidation into one property that can be rented
to a farming company. The agricultural output of the larger property is expected to be significantly higher
than that of the fragmented land, generating revenues for Atera through the rental income. Today, Atera
manages a portfolio of over 33 000 hectares of arable land and outperforms the local stock index.

100. Finally, Bulgaria faces the challenge of increasing investments in low carbon projects
and to put its economy on a low-carbon growth path. To achieve this goal, IFC will also work
with local financial institutions to provide energy efficiency lending and invest in renewable
energy projects (wind and/or biomass). This is particularly relevant in the context of the financial
crisis, which translated into a lack of long-term financing availability particularly for climate
change projects. This will also enable Bulgaria to meet its national target of 16 percent of gross
energy consumption generated by renewable energy sources by 2020.
IV.

RISKS

101. Political Economy Risks. The Government faces the complex challenge of introducing
significant structural reforms within the context of post-crisis environment characterized by
relatively modest growth and constrained fiscal space. The Government will depend on the

29

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013
continued support of the public and social partners to maintain the momentum of reforms, as
municipal and presidential elections are scheduled for end-2011. Mitigating factors are the
Government’s relatively strong public approval ratings and the broad support in Bulgaria for
prudent fiscal policies.
102. Macroeconomic Risks - External Vulnerabilities. The external risks include a possible
slower-than-projected pace of economic recovery of Bulgaria’s main trading and investment
partners, additional unexpected financial shocks which result in higher interest rates and tighter
global financial conditions, and further energy price increases. There is also uncertainty about the
sustainability of recovery and about the measures put in place in the EU and globally to support
financial sectors in these countries. These measures can be expected to have implications for
capital flows to Bulgaria, coming both from parent banks and from private investors. Domestic
risks relate to imbalances accumulated in the private sector, notably the high indebtedness of
firms. As noted above, elements mitigating these risks include: (i) Bulgaria’s solid track record
of fiscal discipline and ongoing reforms implementing fiscal consolidation; and (ii) wellcapitalized and solid level of provisions in the banking sector.
103. General Implementation and Governance Risks. A risk that has been underestimated
in the past is the institutional capacity constraint and weak governance. These have undermined
the Government’s ability to translate commitment to actual implementation of reforms. These
risks are mitigated by the large amounts of technical assistance available to Bulgaria through the
Operational Programs and IFIs, as well as the willingness by the Government to overcome the
obstacles presented by limited institutional capacity. As noted in Box 1, governance reforms are
under careful examination by the EU as a follow-up to the EU accession process, which
determined that continued efforts were needed in this area. Significant progress has been
recorded in the recent report under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, given the
determined actions of the current Government. Nevertheless, risks of slippage will inevitably
remain. Therefore, at the time of the CPS Progress Report, the Bank will assess the effectiveness
of the proposed targeted support to institutional capacity building and sector governance and
adapt this approach as appropriate, in agreement with the Government of Bulgaria. In the
meantime, as the basis for such a review, the Bank will update its fiduciary assessment for
Bulgaria, with particular focus on public financial management.
104. Risks to Implementation of Fee-Based Service. The envisioned scaling up of fee-based
services is dependent on the finalization of a mechanism that will allow the Government to
partially use EU technical assistance grant funds to complement World Bank financed knowledge
and advisory services. Agreement on the mechanism must be reached between the EC, the
Government, the World Bank and participating IFIs. Delays in finalizing this mechanism would
also delay a significant part of planned World Bank knowledge and advisory support, which
would not only impact the expected CPS results, but also Bulgaria’s capacity to fully take
advantage of EU funds to modernize its infrastructure and services. If agreement on this
mechanism is delayed or does not materialize, the CPS program and outcomes will be calibrated
to the proposed lending activities and World Bank-financed knowledge and advisory services in
the areas where fee-based service had been envisioned. A related risk is that the Bank may be
unable to respond effectively to requests for fee-based services. Such a risk can be mitigated by a
screening process within the Bank that will focus on areas where the Bank has a clear
comparative advantage. Other IFIs, in particular the EIB and the EBRD, have already and are
scaling up their knowledge and advisory support and can intervene in their areas of competence,
such as project financing and public-private partnerships.

Bulgaria CPS Completion Report (FY07-FY10)

I. Introduction/Overview
1.
Bulgaria achieved a historical milestone when it joined the EU in January 2007, during the
first year of the FY07-FY10 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).18 Bulgaria’s entry into the EU
brought with it high expectations. It was not only the newest member state, along with Romania, but also
one with the lowest per capita income. Much hope was pinned on EU membership steering the country
towards rapid progress in the political and socio-economic spheres and improving quality of life. To meet
this daunting challenge, the Government of Bulgaria embraced an ambitious reform agenda aimed at
accelerating economic and social integration with the EU. The CPS was, therefore, designed to first
support Bulgaria’s accession efforts and to facilitate EU integration thereafter. It focused on three pillars
that supported the Government’s reform program: (i) sustained increases in productivity and
employment; (ii) fiscal sustainability and absorption of EU funds; and (iii) social inclusion.
2.
The CPS consisted of an annual lending program of $300 million centered on a series of
development policy loans (DPLs) in the social sectors, complemented by investment loans to enhance
roads, municipal infrastructure, social inclusion and regional development. The investment loans
included technical assistance to strengthen government agencies’ ability to absorb and effectively utilize
the large volumes of EU funds expected to flow into Bulgaria.
3.
This CPS Completion Report evaluates the progress achieved towards Bulgaria’s
development goals and assesses how the Bank’s lending operations and AAA products under the
last CPS contributed to these goals. It draws on portfolio reviews conducted during the CPS period,
assessments by task team leaders and the country team, and discussions with key stakeholders. The
lessons learned from implementation have been taken into account in the preparation of the next CPS for
Bulgaria.
II. Bulgaria’s Long Term Strategic Goals
4.
At the time the CPS was presented to the Board, Bulgaria was in the final stretch of its
journey towards EU accession. Concluding the accession process remained at the heart of newlyformed Government’s agenda.19 Much effort was placed on alignment with the EU agenda, and Bulgaria
made continuous progress in addressing lingering EU concerns. For example, the October 2005 EU
Monitoring report identified 16 areas of concern, which were reduced to six in the May 2006 EU
Monitoring report. The Government was also tasked with establishing a credible and effective
institutional structure—as required by the EU—to manage the large volumes of EU grant money that
Bulgaria was about to receive for economic convergence with the EU.
5.
When Bulgaria entered the EU, it faced the challenge of meeting the high expectations of its
citizens. By then, Bulgaria had achieved a good track record of progress. The bitter experience of the
1996-97 economic collapse, the related establishment of a currency board, and the prospect of EU
membership, had propelled Bulgaria along the path toward economic reforms. By 2003, Bulgaria had
achieved a balanced budget and has maintained a fiscal surplus until the onset of the global crisis in 2009.
Between 2000-2008, it enjoyed an average growth rate of 5.6 percent per year. Unemployment rates fell

This CPS was originally intended to cover FY07-FY09 but was extended to FY10.
Following the June 2005 general elections, a coalition government led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party took office
in August 2005.

from close to 20 percent in 2001 to 5.6 percent in 2008 before climbing to 6.8 percent in 2009 as result of
the crisis. Structural reforms helped stimulate private sector growth, and FDI flows steadily increased.
6.
Yet, by the time of EU membership in 2007, Bulgaria’s per capita income stood at only 37
percent of the EU average,20 the lowest among the new member states. Large capital flows from
abroad supported booming domestic demand in Bulgaria, but also contributed to widening external
imbalances. Strong output growth was associated with steady increase in the employment rate, which
reached 96 percent of the EU average in 2007. However, the labor force, constrained by weak skills that
did not match the needs of a rapidly transforming economy, was performing below potential. The
challenge to accelerate productivity growth and raise incomes to levels of EU member countries was,
therefore, pressing. In addition, at the time of accession, the EU underscored the need for continued
progress in reforming the judiciary, combating corruption and organized crime and improving
institutional structures for administering EU funds. As a result, Bulgaria was required to submit progress
reports to the EU, especially on fighting corruption and organized crime.
7.
The National Strategic Reference Framework for 2007-2013 which is used to program EU
funds, identified a series of priorities vital to Bulgaria’s efforts to successfully integrate into the EU.
They included boosting economic competitiveness; strengthening human resources through education,
jobs and social inclusion; upgrading basic infrastructure; promoting balanced regional development;
agricultural and rural development; protecting the environment; and building administrative capacity for
effective public sector delivery and utilization of EU funds. The Convergence Program for 2007-2010
also emphasized sustaining growth by accelerating structural reforms, improving the business
environment, and strengthening institutions. At the time of the CPS, Bulgaria set out to meet the
following country development goals to achieve its overarching objective of EU integration and
convergence:

CPS Objectives

8.
The CPS was anchored in Bulgaria’s long-term vision of evolving into a prosperous European
nation. It was guided by the priorities laid out in the Government’s strategic framework, and focused on
three strategic priorities that are aligned with the country development outcomes sought by the CPS:
(i)

20

Sustained increases in productivity and employment through the continuation of structural
reforms and investments to spur private sector growth. This included:
 Improving the business environment and labor dynamics
 Upgrading human capital and skills for a knowledge economy
 Increasing the employment rate
 Reducing high transport costs resulting from poor road infrastructure

Measured in purchasing power standards, Eurostat data.

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

(ii)

Fiscal sustainability and absorption of EU funds by building capacity for efficient and
effective public expenditure management and investment planning. This included:
 Reforming financing of the education system
 Making the health system financially sustainable
 Improving the efficiency of social protection
 Upgrading the capacity for absorption of EU funds in infrastructure and at the subnational level

(iii)

Social inclusion by promoting polices and investments to close the development gap between
regions and to reduce poverty. This included:
 Improving access to quality health services
 Increasing the participation of marginalized groups such as youth, older unemployed and
the disabled
 Reducing the gap between urban and rural poverty.

Bulgaria’s Progress towards Country Development Goals

9.
Throughout most of the CPS period, Bulgaria achieved significant progress towards its
country development goals (see Table 1). Nearly all targets were achieved with the notable exceptions
of (i) reduction in inflation, which rose dramatically in 2008 due to soaring food and oil prices and (ii)
absorption of EU funds, which remained at very low levels throughout the CPS period. With regards to
reducing poverty and inequality, Bulgaria achieved remarkable progress through 2007. A comparable
follow-up survey is not available for subsequent years, although simulations suggest that poverty may
have increased in 2009 as a result of the crisis.

Country Outcome 1: Sustained Increases in Productivity and Employment
10. Bulgaria enjoyed rapid GDP growth until the onset of the crisis in 2009. Its sound
macroeconomic policies and deep structural reforms helped fuel economic growth, with average GDP
growth exceeding 6 percent per year during the 2004-2007 period, and reaching 6.2 percent for 2008.
However, the global financial crisis and economic downturn in the US and EU have dampened Bulgaria’s

39

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

medium term prospects. In 2009, growth declined by 4.9 percent. The economy began its recovery in
second quarter of 2010, and growth is estimated to remain flat for 2010.21
11. Competitiveness was boosted with regulatory reforms, but there remains need for
improvement. Favorable tax regime and improvements in the business environment helped fuel an
increase in FDI inflows, which averaged close to 20 percent of GDP since 2005. While the Government
has taken steps to cut red tape and reform the regulatory environment, Bulgarian firms continue to signal
that burden of regulation remains high. Strong economic growth was associated with substantial
improvements in labor market performance.
12. The declining trend in unemployment was maintained until 2008, but was reversed as a result
of the global financial crisis. The number of people in employment increased by more than 400,000
between 2004 and 2008, with most of the new jobs generated in the private sector mainly in construction
and service sectors, while employment in public sector further declined. In addition, shortages of labor
pushed wages up through 2008. The recession in 2009, however, partially erased the employment gains
of the boom years. Unemployment, which declined to record low levels in 2008 (from 12.2 percent in
2004 to 5.7 percent in 2008) rose to 6.9 percent in 2009. Exporting firms responded to the worsening
external environment and weakened demand by cutting labor. In 2009, Bulgaria’s labor force
participation rate stood at 67.3 percent, only marginally lower than the EU10 average of 67.8 percent.
Country Outcome II: Fiscal Sustainability and Absorption of EU Funds
13. Prudent fiscal and income policies during good times provided a cushion against the impact of
the global crisis. Continued fiscal consolidation and enhanced revenue performance resulted in fiscal
surpluses during 2003-2008, which were saved into a fiscal reserve account that reached 12.1 percent of
GDP in 2008. Thus, when the economic downturn led to a marked worsening of fiscal revenues in 2009,
Bulgaria was able to tap into domestic resources to finance emerging fiscal deficits. Inflation averaged
6.5 percent between 2004 and 2006, and increased to 7.6 percent on average in 2007 due to stronger
domestic demand and soaring food and oil prices combined with an increase in administrative prices and
harmonization of excises with EU levels. Inflation continued to rise in 2008 as global commodity prices
surged and demand pressures remained high. In 2009, it plummeted to 2.5 percent as international prices
fell and pressures from wage growth decelerated with declining demand for labor.
14. Public expenditure target was met during the CPS period. Between 2005-2009, public
expenditure remained below 38 percent as a share of GDP—well below the 40 percent ceiling envisaged
in the Government’s medium-term fiscal framework
15. Absorption of EU Funds remained well below potential, with clear need for capacity
improvement. Absorption of pre-accession funds remained relatively low because of administrative
capacity constraints, and as in other new member states, picked up by the end of the financing period.
Annual inflows of EU pre-accession funds almost doubled between 2004-2007—reaching close to €830
million in 2007. But implementation of some EU funded projects was marred by corruption allegations,
leading the EU to suspend more than €500 million in pre-accession financing in 2008. Upon acceding to
the EU in 2007, Bulgaria became eligible to receive €6.7 billion in Structural and Cohesion Funds for the
2007-2013 programming cycle. By end-2009 however, Bulgaria received €635 million from the EC—
only 9.5 percent of the total allocation. Implementation rate of these funds, at 3 percent, is even lower,
pointing to clear need to strengthen management of EU funds. Prime Minister Borissov’s Government
declared this a priority when it took office in 2009.

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

Country Outcome II: Social Inclusion
16. Bulgaria achieved remarkable progress in fighting poverty, but the crisis appears to have
caused some setback in this area. The poverty rate22 declined dramatically—from 20 percent in 2003 to
only 10.2 percent in 2007. During the same period, extreme poverty23 also declined rapidly from 11
percent to 4.5 percent. Much of this progress has been attributed to structural reforms, macroeconomic
stability and growth which lifted household consumption levels. However, the financial crisis appears to
have some setbacks in this area, and simulations point to a 2 percent increase in the total poverty
headcount for 2009 to a level close to 6 percent. Overall, persistent pockets of poverty remain among
unskilled adults, ethnic minorities, children in large families, and the elderly with weak family support
structure. In 2007, the Roma comprised more than 40 percent of the poor and two-thirds of the extreme
poor, which is disproportionally high compared to their share in the total population.
17. Improvement in inequality was concentrated in urban centers. Inequality levels, as measured
by the Gini coefficient, declined by 10 percent between 2003 and 2007—dropping to levels lower than
recent EU entrants such as Estonia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. Much of the improvement in
inequality occurred in urban areas where inequality declined by close to 11 percent vs. nearly 4 percent in
rural areas, pointing to a continued need to address the urban-rural gap in living standards.

CPS Outcomes Assessment

18. This section reviews the progress achieved towards meeting the development challenges,
outcomes and intermediate indicators outlined in the CPS. The results matrix in Annex 1 summarizes
the progress towards outcomes, supported by relevant data, and the Bank Group instruments that
contributed to these outcomes. This section provides a general discussion on results achieved organized
according to the three country outcomes and the 10 development challenges around which the CPS was
designed.
19. The CPS outcomes achieved to date are largely driven by the ongoing portfolio and the DPL
program, the centerpiece of the lending program. Processing delays resulted in the lending program
planned for FY08 to slip to FY09 and FY10, which has shortened the timeframe to review anticipated
outcomes for the final year of the CPS. Hence, the results achieved to date are driven by the policy
reform agenda supported by the DPL program, the active portfolio and a robust program of AAA.

20. The Government of Bulgaria adopted a series of measures to improve the business climate as
part of the overall goal to boost productivity and employment. In April 2008, the Council of
Ministers (CoM) adopted the Better Regulation Program 2008-2010 which simplified or removed several
regulatory regimes. Business start-up was made easier with the creation of a central database for
commercial registration and streamlining registration procedures. To reduce tax burden on business and
increase compliance, the Government also implemented tax reforms and overhaul of revenue
administration. In 2006-2007, corporate tax was reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent and employers’
labor tax by 7 percentage points. In 2006, the collection of tax and social contributions were integrated
with a number of new measures to improve compliance and taxpayer services. In addition, the Law on
Encouragement of Investments was amended to promote the high-tech sector, encourage industries that
use renewable energy and create jobs in lagging regions. In the 2008 Doing Business report, Bulgaria
ranked among the top ten reformers worldwide for streamlining procedures related to licensing, paying
taxes and enforcing contracts.
21. Substantive progress was made on tax administration reforms in particular. The Bank
supported Bulgaria’s efforts to achieve fiscal sustainability from the revenue side. The Revenue
Administration Reform Project (FY04), launched under the previous CAS (FY03-05) and implemented
throughout this CPS period, contributed to an efficient revenue collection system which contributed to
improving the business environment. Tax and social contribution revenues increased by 5.4 percentage
points of GDP between 2002 and 2007, despite substantial cuts in rates and changes to value-added tax
(VAT) payment procedures following Bulgaria’s EU accession. Compliance rates improved for all tax
types, improving the level playing field for private sector development and creating room to cut tax rates.
Today, Bulgarian companies and individuals enjoy one of the lowest tax rates in Europe. In the Doing

42

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

Business and Paying Taxes reports, Bulgaria was cited as one of the few countries that consistently
improved tax policy and tax administration between 2004-2007.
22. The Bank contributed to the policy dialogue on investment climate reforms through a series
of timely AAA work. Accelerating Bulgaria’s Convergence: the Challenge of Raising Productivity
reveals that for Bulgaria to converge with EU income levels in 30 years, productivity growth needs to
increase to 5 percent per annum—more than double the current rate—by promoting competitive product
markets; enhancing flexibility of labor markets; narrowing the skills gap, and strengthening R&D to
support innovation. The Regulatory Impact Assessment technical assistance, conducted jointly with
the Ministry of Economy and Energy, highlighted the need for a national policy for regulatory reform that
calls for institutionalization of national regulatory system, and the role of the private sector in boosting
productivity. Many of the recommendations of the RIA TA were included in the Government’s Better
Regulation Program 2008-2010. The Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) offered recommendations
which the Government is also adopting, including performing a full assessment of Limiting
Administrative Regulation and Administrative Control on Economic Activities. For an assessment
of measures taken to improve labor market dynamics, please refer to paragraphs 46-47.

23. The education reforms Bulgaria pursued during the CPS period focused on addressing the
declining quality of education and the weak capacity to assess quality. The SIR DPL Series was
central to this effort. As part of the prior actions for DPL I (FY07), pilot national assessments were
introduced at the 4th and 7th grades, and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Science (MEYS) started to
implement what turned out to be a successful National Strategy for the Introduction of Information
Technologies in Bulgarian schools. Prior to DPL II (FY09), Bulgaria participated in international
assessment tests such as PISA 2006 and 2009, PIRLS 2006 and TIMSS 2007. National reports were
issued for all three assessments. In PISA, the 2009 text scores revealed an improvement in student
performance in math and reading by 14 and 27 points respectively, compared with the 2006 scores.
24. A major breakthrough supported by the SIR DPL was the introduction of Matura, the
secondary school leaving examinations as a secondary education credential. This created an
opportunity to recognize the results of these examinations as an entrance criterion for higher education
enrollment campaigns. The Matura examinations took place in June and September 2008, and in May
2009. The results to date on continued enrollment beyond secondary education are promising: the
percentage of 18-24 years-old with only lower secondary education and not in school is down from 24 in
2004 to 16.3 in 2009. Moreover, dropout rates declined across all age groups between the 2004/05 and
2009/10 school years.

43

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

25. By the end of the DPL series, Bulgaria strengthened its capacity to systematically supervise or
monitor education quality. Thanks to the wealth of student assessment data now available, Bulgaria has
been able to use the evidence to improve school and classroom quality and build institutional capacity for
system-wide assessment of education quality. In 2008, increased EU financing for the Center for Control
and Assessment of the Quality of Education (CKOKO) represented an important breakthrough,
supporting the recruitment of new technical staff. These developments reflect that Bulgaria is well into
the process of consolidating the capacity for monitoring student achievement and evaluating impact of
reforms on education quality. Education reform needs to now expand to vocational and tertiary
education—still with very low participation rates compared with EU counterparts—as well as lifelong
learning to create the basis for future sustained productivity increases.

26. Strong labor demand in Bulgaria triggered big gains in employment for most of the CPS
period. The employment rate increased from 58.6 percent in 2006 to 64 percent in 2008, before dropping
to 62.6 in 2009 as a result of the crisis. Compared to the EU27 average, activity and employment rates
remained low, and Bulgaria has significant untapped domestic labor reserves—particularly among the
young and older workers. At the same time, labor productivity per hours worked, while increasing from
30.5 percent of the EU27 average in 2004 to 35.1 percent in 2009, remains the lowest in the EU.
Moreover, the share of Bulgaria’s long-term unemployed as a share of the total unemployed—while
declining steadily from 55.8 percent in 2006 to 43.5 percent in 2009—remains higher than that of the
EU27.
27. Through the SIR DPL series, the CPS supported Government efforts to remove disincentives
to employment creation. As part of the DPL reforms, the Government amended the Labor Code to
increase flexibility of working time and fixed term and part-time contracts—a prior action in DPL I. The
Government also amended the Social Insurance Code to lower employers’ contribution rate for pension
insurance from 29 to 23 percent in January 2006. An additional reduction took place in 2007 and 2008.
In 2009, the contribution rate was 18 percent of the payroll. To remove employment disincentives in the
social assistance system, the Government also tightened social assistance eligibility: as of July 2006,
eligibility for Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) for able-bodied working age beneficiaries was limited
to a maximum of 18 months. The duration of GMI receipt was further reduced to 12 months as of July
2008, but recent changes aimed at harmonizing with EU practices will remove the limitation for receiving
the GMI starting 2011.
28. The CPS contributed to labor market reform by introducing a new model of results-based
active labor market programs, which will benefit from EU financing through the Human Resources
Development Operational Program. The Social Investment and Employment Promotion (SIEP) project
(FY03) helped create more than 930,000 days of temporary and permanent work—33 percent above
target. About 1,600 of the people employed under the infrastructure micro-projects were previously long-

term unemployed. More than 700,000 people benefited from the small social infrastructure
improvements and services on municipal and community level through the demand-driven subprojects.

29. Bulgaria’s overall transport policy is now aligned with the rest of the EU, but investments are
still taking longer than envisaged by the Government. Implementation capacity needs to be
strengthened and more work is needed to remove cumbersome and bureaucratic hurdles in investment
implementation.
30. Road conditions in Bulgaria have started to improve, albeit with delays, with direct impact on
road transport costs. Under the Road Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (FY07) which remains
under implementation, the Bank is supporting the Government define a prioritized roads investment
program within its medium-term expenditure framework, develop capacity in the Road Infrastructure
Agency in investment programming and implementation, and finance rehabilitation of selected primary
and secondary roads to facilitate regional development and access to markets. Overall, the share of roads
in good condition increased from 35 percent in 2004/05 to about 45 percent in 2009. This increase mostly
benefited Class I roads (from 51 percent to 70 percent), and to a lesser extent Class II roads (from 37
percent to 38 percent), and Class III roads (from 28 percent to 40 percent). While this is lower than the
CPS’ ambitious targets for Class II and III roads, this does reflect a logical prioritization of Class I roads,
since they carry more traffic and suffered from underinvestment in the past.
31. Road asset management practices also improved, with the development of a road asset
management system under the Bank’s road project. The system helps prioritize public spending on
roads, evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of road programs, and monitor road conditions at a time when
significant amounts of money are expected to be spent on roads. It also includes a new revenue
generating mechanism through the introduction of a vignette system. Revenue from this vignette system
is generating close to €100 million per year from road users, which represents a 50 percent increase over
the vignette level in 2005.

32. The 2007 and 2008 Budget Acts which introduced per capita financing for all municipal
schools, triggered the largest consolidation of the Bulgarian school system in recent history. The
SIR DPL series was central to Bulgaria’s efforts to improve the education system’s fiscal sustainability
through the introduction of per capita financing, delegated budgets to schools and school-based
management. Bulgaria’s rapidly shrinking school age population had been causing declining class sizes
and very inefficient schools which could offer only limited schooling, and a school rationalization was
need both to improve education quality and to improve efficiency. In the years before the 2007 Budget
Acts, the average number of school closures hovered around 50 per year. This number rose to 90 school
closures during the summer of 2007, and 311 closures during the summer of 2008. The school
consolidation helped reverse the trend of declining student numbers in schools, with the number of
students per school steadily increasing from 287 in 2007/08 to 307 in 2008/09 and 305 in 2009/10. The
successful implementation of school optimization programs also resulted in a large adjustment in the
number of pedagogical and non-pedagogical personnel. An estimated 30 percent of school personnel
were laid off since the start of the DPL program. As a result, the student-teacher ratio in 2008/09
improved significantly for the first time in more than a decade, and is now estimated to exceed 15 across
vocational and general education schools in grades 1-12. These new student-teacher ratios are comparable
to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) average at 16.3 in primary
schools and 13.5 in secondary schools.
33. Provisions of per capita financing for municipal schools, delegated budget and school-based
management continued to be reflected in the 2009 Budget Act. Today, all schools receive funds using
per student formula and have delegated budgets. There is widespread unanimity across the political
spectrum that a new law on school and pre-school education and preparation would tie together all
elements of the financing and governance reforms, and ultimately boost the quality and accountability of
the education system.

34. Progress towards increasing the fiscal sustainability of health spending was mixed, given the
politically difficult nature of health reforms. The DPL aimed to support the financial sustainability of
the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) by trying to control growth of its main cost drivers. The
NHIF was burdened by ineffective allocation of resources to hospitals and physicians with no ceilings for
volume of services; a large hospital infrastructure that continues to grow; and rapid expenditure growth
on pharmaceuticals. Supported by the Bank’s DPL series, the Government introduced important
measures to contain growth of hospital spending, in particular through the introduction of annual ceilings.

24

Actuarial calculations are not done, but balanced budget maintained between 2000-2007under HRSP.

46

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

In the 2008 NHIF Budget Act, the fee-for-service open-ended payment was replaced with a new formula
that allocates resources on a per capita basis with limits. Measures to improve the hospital budget
allocation mechanism helped reduce arrears in the health system by more than 50 percent: arrears
uncovered by assets declined from BGL 60.8 million in 2005 to BGL 19.6 million in 2008. But in 2009,
the arrears increased to BGL 29.7 million.
35. The NHIF maintained its financial health and benefited from strong synergies between the
DPL program and the health project. Administrative costs declined from 5.3 percent of its total budget
in 2000 to 2.2 percent in 2009, and a balanced budget was maintained under the Health Sector Reform
project (FY00). While the DPL program provided a policy framework to improve the health financing
system, like pharmaceutical policy and restructuring of hospitals, the health project launched under the
previous CAS and implemented throughout this CPS period, supported the implementation of these
policies. A major achievement of the HRSP was the launch of a fully integrated information system for
the NHIF in 2009 which directly links the payer with providers and users of services, thus improving
efficiency and reducing administrative burden.
36. The hospital masterplan finalized under the DPL was not adopted—and contrary to the
plan’s recommendations, Bulgaria saw a rise in the number of hospitals. It was clear that the
political will to implement these difficult reforms had been overestimated. The masterplan remains ready
to be adopted and implemented. Other DPL-supported reforms included channeling major part of
payments for hospital service through the NHIF, making it the single payer and removing the earlier
system’s inconsistencies where hospitals received payments for the same service through several
publicly-funded mechanisms. But this has not led to selective contracting. The DPL series also
supported the accreditation of hospitals, but the quality assurance system including accreditation is weak
and no significant improvements have been identified.

37. Coverage of social protection in Bulgaria is high, albeit declining, and key social assistance
programs (child allowances, heating allowances and the GMI program) are responding to the recent
economic crisis. In 2010, 60 percent of the poorest households whose income dropped during the crisis
were receiving at least one benefit from the Government’s social package, and more than 70 percent of
households received one or more social protection transfers.
38. During the CPS period, the Government introduced several amendments to its social
assistance program aimed at boosting targeting for two key anti-poverty programs—GMI and the
heating allowance. They are by far the most pro-poor programs, with 64 percent of GMI and 73 percent
of heating allowance benefits accruing to households in the first quintile and 54 and 53 percent,

47

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

respectively, going to the poor. While the amendment of social assistance legislation was not a part of the
DPL per se, the DPL II did support ex ante analysis of survey and administrative data pertaining to
beneficiaries losing their benefits eligibility, which contributed to Government efforts to design targeted
action plans to assist this group.
39. Between 2004 and 2009, the number of GMI beneficiaries declined steadily from
approximately 128,000 to 36,000. As a result of the crisis, this number increased in 2010 to
approximately 45,000. This increase was supported by the Bank, which took the position that the number
of recipients served by the unemployment benefit program and income-tested social assistance programs
should be allowed to grow to protect the new poor or unemployed and to allow these programs to fulfill
their role as economic stabilizers. During the CPS period, the Bank was not involved in dialogue on
disability and thus did not achieve results towards disability-related outcomes.

40. Transparent and efficient administration of EU funds was an important priority for both the
EC and Bulgaria, but absorption of EU funds remained a challenge. In July 2008, the EC froze some
€500 million in pre-accession funds because of concerns over corruption and organized crime. Later that
year, the EC terminated the accreditation of two agencies responsible for PHARE25 funds management (at
Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works) as it was not satisfied with
measures taken by the Government to address governance issues. This meant that Bulgaria would lose
funds totaling approximately €220 million, not yet contracted under the PHARE program. It would also
have to finance already contracted projects of about €340 million from its own sources. A portion of the
suspended funds for roads projects were later unblocked in 2009, after Bulgaria took steps to improve
procedures and auditing in the state road infrastructure agency. When the GERB-led Government took
office in 2009, it pledged to accelerate Bulgaria’s absorption of EU funds to spur growth and investments.
During the 2007-2013 programming period, Bulgaria is eligible to receive €6.7 billion in grants, of which
it absorbed only €635 million by end 2009.
41. To support Bulgaria in overcoming the challenge of EU funds absorption, the CPS proposed a
two-pronged strategy to (i) improve the efficiency of public spending, especially in the social sectors
through the DPL program, in order to create fiscal space; and (ii) support the Government in developing a
project pipeline for high-priority investments and strengthen related institutional capacities at the central
and local levels. Bank support in improving the efficiency of public spending was timely through the

25

PHARE, a pre-accession instrument, was the main channel for the EC’s financial and technical cooperation with
countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

48

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

DPL program. With regards to developing a project pipeline and capacity-building, progress was limited
due to slippages in delivery of projects that included technical assistance for EU funds absorption, and the
very limited scope of these projects with respect to the way EU Funds had been targeted. These projects
included the Social Inclusion Project (FY09), and the Municipal Infrastructure Development Project
(FY09). The municipal project will prepare regional water and wastewater master plans for water
companies across Bulgaria (with the exception of Sofia), and thus help identify priority investments and
plan for their financing through the EU’s Operational Program for Environment. An earlier project, the
Social Investment and Employment Promotion (SIEP) Project (FY03, FY07) supported capacitybuilding for national, regional and local stakeholders as well as the service provider sector for
implementing projects under the EU’s Operational Program for Human Resources Development. SIEP
created a menu of active labor market programs according to the rules and format for European Social
Fund (ESF) financing. However, the bulk of EU funds were programmed to support transport, and very
little progress was made in this area in absorption, and the Bank did not seek at the time to explicitly
target this as an area of intervention.
42. On the AAA front, the Bank provided analytical support to Bulgaria’s efforts to strengthen
the judiciary combat corruption—a key EU concern that led to the suspension of EU funds. The
Judiciary Public Expenditure and Institutional Review assessed the efficiency and effectiveness of
public spending on Bulgaria’s judiciary and proposed measures to introduce a strategic approach for
budgeting of the judiciary and improve accountability and transparency. As a result, the judiciary’s 2008
budget request began introducing performance data, and this continued for the 2009 budget. In addition,
in response to a request from the Prosecutor General, the Bank mobilized an IDF Grant to enhance the
capacity of the Office of the Prosecutor General to combat corruption. The most recent EU report under
the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism provided overall a very positive assessment of Bulgaria’s
progress in this area, especially its fight against corruption and organized crime.
43. In addition, the Regional Development TA provided a forum to address strategic
implementation issues that affect municipal absorption and efficient use of ERDF funds, with a
particular focus on the OP Regional Development. Three how-to notes were produced on strengthening:
(i) regional implementation structures and project selection criteria and processes; (ii) financing of
municipal investments; and, (iii) strategic regional, district, and local development planning. A decision
was taken in December 2008 to channel related financial support for regional development through DPL
3 rather than a free standing investment project to the Government’s designated organization for
supporting municipalities—the Fund for Local Authorities and Governments (FLAG). However, it must
be noted that this area as well has seen little progress in readiness for EU Funds absorption and the
modest intervention by the Bank can be seen to have been too small to have had any major impact.

44. During the CPS period, Bulgaria made modest progress in advancing the agenda to bring
healthcare within the reach of citizens. National programs were launched that aimed at including
disadvantaged groups in monitoring and prophylactic activities. These programs comprised special

49

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

mobile screening programs in poor communities, HIV/AIDS testing and provision of free medicines. In
addition, the Government set up a fund at the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MLPS) to pay for
hospital services to uninsured and socially vulnerable persons. Measures were also taken to reduce the
number of people without insurance coverage. Pharmaceutical legislation was improved to ensure
medicines are offered at competitive prices and that all insured citizens have access to the medicines that
are fully or partially reimbursed. However, there was no progress in or perceived commitment to the
need for hospital rationalization, and the hospital sector continued to consume a disproportionate share of
health expenditures, notably on buildings.
45. The Bank supported Bulgaria’s health reforms through the SIR DPL series and Health Sector
Reform Project (FY00), but implementation of pharmaceutical policies was weak. The DPL series
proposed to support increased access to basic care by revising reimbursement policies for basic drugs,
which were preventing vulnerable groups from obtaining them at affordable prices. By enabling the
Government to procure drugs at cheaper rates, the new policies was expected to pass the cost savings to
consumers, but ultimately it did not reduce overall pharmaceutical expenditures neither by the NHIF, nor
the population as the new drug list included new and expensive drugs. The percentage of people who had
foregone medical care for financial reasons increased from 20 to 29 percent between 2003-2007. The
explanation for this trend is not clear, but may reflect aging and/or higher demands due to supply-side
improvements.
46. Notable improvements were made in the outpatient care sector, where the system of GPs has
played a gate-keeping role, but informal payments remain a problem. The HSRP substantially
refurbished the outpatient care sector (with equipment and IT for the majority of Bulgaria’s primary care
practices), and helped upgrade the hospital sector (through civil works and restructuring at two national
and five municipal hospitals, and equipment leasing arrangements for nearly 100 hospitals). The HSRP
also provided financing for 260 ambulances to expedite medical assistance in emergencies.
Nevertheless, the percentage of people who reported giving a bribe to receive medical services remained
largely unchanged between 2000 (7.2 percent) and 2008 (6.1 percent).

47. Employment rates for young and older workers in Bulgaria have risen in recent years, but
remain below EU average for youth—24.8 percent in Bulgaria compared to 35.1 percent for the EU27
in 2009. Even though social inclusion were not explicit themes of the SIR DPL, the policies supported
by the program were well placed to positively impact the poor by focusing on the skills gap vulnerable
groups and enhancing employment prospects for individuals in low-quality subsidized jobs. Through the
policy dialogue with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Science, the DPL program supported a set of
incentives and mitigating measures in the ministry’s budget so that municipalities consolidating schools
could provide additional services to at-risk groups. The same applied to the ex ante and ex post
assessments of changes in social welfare policies, which informed the development of employment
activation programs for people losing social assistance eligibility.
48. The DPL supported measures to strengthen employment incentives in social assistance,
helping reduce the number of GMI beneficiaries in a period of economic growth. Between 2007 and

50

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

2009, the number of GMI beneficiaries fell from 93,000 to 38,000. Under DPL2, the Government
adopted the 2008 National Action Plan for Employment which continued restructuring active labor
market policies (ALMP) to make them more demand-driven and focused on vulnerable groups. The
restructured ALMP targeted the unemployed, inactive and discouraged persons, and gave employers
incentives to employ ALMP beneficiaries. ALMPs also became more open to life-long learning, creation
of sustainable jobs and wider participation of the private sector (instead of municipalities) as providers
and financiers, and less prone to confining qualified workers in low-quality subsidized jobs. The Social
Investment and Employment Promotion Project (FY03, FY07) contributed to the creation and testing
of the operational framework for results-based ALMPs, some of which were then introduced in the
mainstream system.

49. In spite of significant decline in poverty across the country, Bulgaria’s rural population
continues to face higher poverty rates than the urban population. In 2007, the incidence of poverty
in rural areas was 6 percentage points higher than in urban areas—down from 13 percentage points
differential in 2003. Although the magnitude of the decline in rural poverty was large, the rural
population continues to face significantly higher poverty rates than the urban population. Challenges
remain to overcome multiple barriers to employment, education and other public services and break the
cycle of exclusion.
50. Supported by the DPL series, policies to tackle social exclusion have been introduced, in
particular focusing on employment activation measures for disadvantaged job seekers. The Social
Investment and Employment Project (FY03, FY07) was also designed to improve living standards in
municipalities across the country where pockets of poverty were prevalent. The project targeted the poor
and disadvantaged by supporting community-led infrastructure projects and provision of labor market
services. More than 700,000 people benefited from the community infrastructure component, and more
than 25,000 from the active labor market programs. Bank lending operations designed to reduce poverty
and increase social inclusion were underpinned by the Programmatic Living Standards Monitoring
Update. Data collected through the Multi-topic Household Survey (MTHS) is providing an update on
Bulgaria’s living standards and poverty and baseline indicators for evaluating the Government’s social
sector reforms, supported by the SIR DPL series and Social Inclusion Project (FY09).
CPS Program Performance Rating
51. Overall the performance of the FY07-FY10 CPS program is rated moderately satisfactory.
The program achieved substantive progress toward two key CPS outcomes—education and labor
reforms—which were priorities on the national agenda and enjoyed strong ownership by the Government.
Education and labor reforms were also at the heart of the SIR DPL series, the centerpiece of the CPS. In
education, which was the most successful component of the DPL series, the introduction of financing
reforms and school assessments contributed to positive results in enrollment and student performance.
Labor market dynamics were also significantly enhanced with the introduction of a more flexible labor
code and improved social protection to increase incentives for employment generation. Employment

51

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

during the CPS period was on an increasing trend until 2009, when it fell slightly with the onset of the
global economic crisis. Similarly, Bulgaria made strides in reducing poverty and inequality, although the
crisis may have reduced these gains.
52. The CPS program, however, made limited progress toward stabilizing public spending on
health and increased absorption of EU funds. The health component proved to be the most
challenging in the DPL program. Government ownership for politically difficult reforms such as hospital
rationalization was overestimated, and looming elections in 2009 delayed action. Nevertheless, the CPS
program did lay the foundation for future reforms. The DPL supported the development of a hospital
masterplan that is ready for implementation. The introduction of a new IT system for NHIF under the
HRSP also set the stage for improved governance and transparency in health spending. In terms of EU
funds absorption, public sector capacity constraints and institutional weaknesses emerged as major
obstacles to the preparation and implementation of projects for EU financing. These obstacles, combined
with (i) slow decision-making and weak planning on the part of the Bulgarian Government and (ii)
slippages and implementation delays in Bank projects with components on EU funds absorption, as well
as a clear under-diagnosis of what would be needed to achieve this objective, hindered progress on this
CPS outcome. By the end of the CPS period, resolving these constraints became a top priority for the
Bulgarian Government, and the Bank was asked to shift its focus to providing technical assistance and
advisory services to accelerate EU funds absorption in the infrastructure sector.

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

53. Overall Bank performance during the CPS period was moderately satisfactory. The CPS was
designed and implemented during the period when Bulgaria’s development agenda shifted from EU
accession to accelerating convergence to EU living standards. These priorities underpinned the design of
the CPS which appropriately centered on supporting Government efforts to boost productivity, generate
jobs, improve fiscal efficiency and absorption of EU grants as well as foster social inclusion. The CPS
maintained this focus throughout the implementation period, and the dialogue with the Bulgarian
authorities was further strengthened as the Bank positioned itself as a relevant development partner. The
Bank pro-actively continued this dialogue through the transition between governments in 2009. Demand
for Bank policy advice during the CPS period increased significantly, turning around a Bank-client
relationship that had been previously difficult, to an exemplary one in the region.
54. The results framework was designed at a time when Bulgaria was experiencing sustained
growth and in that context, the outcome indicators were reasonably realistic. But the anticipated
outcomes in the health sector, traditionally a difficult sector, were probably ambitious. More
consideration could have been given to the electoral cycle and its impact on reform and project
implementation. The CPS design also could have given more consideration to two factors that
constrained project implementation, particularly in connection with EU funds absorption: (i) capacity and
institutional weaknesses; and (ii) time needed for Bulgaria to adapt to EU membership and the
responsibilities that come with it.
55. In terms of lending, the portfolio during the CPS period consisted of a total of 14 operations
(including three DPL operations for total commitment amount of US$500 million, and two GEF grants
for the total amount of US$17.5 million) with net commitments totaling US$1,095.7 million equivalent.
Six out of seven projects from the previous CAS closed during the CPS period, while the remaining in
end March 2010. In FY07-FY10, three DPLs totaling US$500 million, four investment operations, and
one supplemental financing operation entered the portfolio.

56. The quality of the Bulgaria portfolio remained satisfactory until FY10, when the
Government’s fiscal austerity resulted in reduced public investments, leading to implementation
delays in World Bank-financed projects. The Road Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project and TTFSE2
experienced a relatively slow start and faced unexpected bottlenecks involving the subsidiary agreement
between the Ministry of Finance and the then National Road Infrastructure Fund and amendments in the
Duty Free Trade Law. In 2010, two projects —Social Inclusion and the Road Infrastructure
Rehabilitation—saw their ratings downgraded due to implementation delays. Projects from the previous

57. The quality of Bank projects at exit was satisfactory for all projects that closed during the

59. The FY07 lending program was delivered fully, but planned lending for FY08 slipped to
FY09. EU membership posed additional challenges to Bulgarian institutions and their capacity to
efficiently absorb the newly-available EU structural funds. As a result, the Government focused its efforts
on setting up relevant institutions and procedures to effectively manage and absorb EU funds, which
placed additional strain on limited institutional capacity and diverted attention from non-EU related
priorities. This is likely to have affected the planned FY08 program which included SIR DPL2, Social
Inclusion Project (SIP) and Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (MIDP) and led to delays in
project preparation. The presentation of the SIP to the Board may have also been affected by timeconsuming discussions between the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and Ministry of Labor and Social Policy

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

(MoLSP) on issues of fiscal space and sectoral budgetary allocations. The delays in MIDP preparation
were related to capacity constraints at the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works
(MRDPW, the need to adjust project design26 and delayed decisions on complementary EU financing.
This led to cancellation of the PHRD Grant for the preparation of the MIDP, with only 10 percent of the
grant amount spent.
60. The DPL program played a central role in delivering results in the CPS. The DPL stayed on
track in supporting a structured dialogue on difficult social sector reforms in a complex environment.
Different interests required arbitration within a multi-faceted coalition Government in the face of high
expectations of rapid increases in living standards and improvements in social service delivery.
Furthermore, in the light of the global financial crisis and the economic situation in the country, the
Government and the Bank reviewed the FY09 lending program and agreed to re-allocate the resources
originally intended for the Regional Development Project to DPL3. The preparation of DPL3 was
accelerated and approved by the Board in May 2009.
World Bank Analytical and Advisory Program
61. A front-loaded AAA program provided timely support in core policy areas and underpinning
the design of lending operations. The AAA program strongly supported Government efforts to improve
living standards and accelerate EU convergence. For example, the Accelerating Bulgaria’s Convergence:
The Challenge of Raising Productivity report (FY07), and Judicial Public Expenditure and Institutional
Review (FY08) facilitated discussion and consensus among stakeholders on the Government’s reform
agenda. Some of the reforms and recommendations proposed in Accelerating Bulgaria’s Convergence
report in education and R&D were included in the 2009 budget. The Bank responded quickly to
Government priorities by preparing a results-based performance framework for modernizing the judicial
system, which was followed up by the Judicial Public Expenditure and Institutional Review aimed at
enhancing the judiciary’s capacity to justify better budget requests. A series of AAA work on regulatory
reforms such as Product Market Regulation in Bulgaria: A Comparison with OECD Countries (FY07),
Regulatory Impact Assessment (FY07) and Investment Climate Assessment (FY08) served as a basis of the
Government’s Better Regulation Program.
62. The Bank’s analytical work was perceived as relevant, of high quality and impartial by the
Bulgarian authorities and sought after by key stakeholders. Several reports were discussed at the
highest Government level, including Accelerating Bulgaria’s Convergence report at the Council for
Economic Policy and the Investment Climate Assessment report at the Council for Promotion of SMEs.
The Government’s interest also extended to the regional studies and analytical work, including ACT-3,
Red-to-Grey, and the yearly Doing Business Reports. All these reports generated broad media
coverage—in print, radio, television and internet based—in the form of independent reporting, interviews
and dedicated presentations. Demand for the Bank’s analytical services continued to outstrip the Bank’s
ability to deliver.
63. The AAA program was also instrumental in launching a dialogue with the new Government
in 2009 and helped position the Bank as an informed partner for reforms during the transition. As part of
the engagement process, the Bank produced a set of 16 policy notes and presented them to the Council of
Ministers within two months of the Government taking office. The policy note series built on the work
throughout the CPS period and served as a basis for continued policy dialogue in the areas of: (i)
economic management; (ii) business environment; (iii) infrastructure development; and (iv) human

26

The project design was substantially changed at the request of the GoB. This warranted re-appraisal of the
operation, which led to slippage of the Board date to the first quarter of FY10.

development and social cohesion. The policy notes aimed to both support the new Government in
developing its own program and sector strategies, and to serve as a basis for setting priorities for the
Bank’s future work program in Bulgaria – to be agreed on in a subsequent CPS.

IFC Lending
64. IFC continued its operations in Bulgaria during the CPS period, as the ease of doing business
improved, foreign direct investment inflows increased, and private sector financiers stepped in to provide
the necessary financing. Nevertheless, due to the country’s accession to the EU, IFC’s engagement has
been selective and only if there was a clear strategic rationale. Further to that the focus has centered on
areas such as infrastructure, agriculture and renewable energy. During the CPS FY07-10, IFC financed
about US$102 million or about 50percent of FY04-06 IFC’s commitments27. IFC invested in 6 projects
in financial markets, general manufacturing, energy, oil and gas and agriculture.
65. Overall, IFC’s investments reached USD 371.9 million as the biggest commitment amounted to
USD 126 million for the construction of a renewable energy farm in the Municipality of Kavarna (AES
Kavarna). This is a project which will considerably improve the renewable energy capabilities of the
county and contribute to its sustainable development goals. The wind farm has increased Bulgaria’s
electricity output from renewable energy by approx 330 GWh per annum, thereby contributing to
Bulgaria progress towards the 16 percent target by 2020. It will decrease the country’s dependence on
highly-polluting coal-lignite fired generation and nuclear generation and in doing so save up to
approximately 300,000 tons of carbon emissions per year. An indirect intrinsic impact of the project,
stemming from the size of the transaction, would be the positive influence on Bulgaria’s ability to attract
foreign investment in the renewable energy sector and position Bulgaria as an alternative emerging

56

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

market destination for wind power investments. The other noteworthy project is an investment
supporting the expansion of Advance Terrafund (ATERA), a company investing in agricultural land in
Bulgaria promoting land consolidation. IFC’s investment will enable the company to achieve its
expansion plans, thus further supporting the development of the real estate and farming markets in the
country and addressing the urgent need for consolidation of agricultural land. Farmland consolidation is
expected to create opportunities for investment and growth of efficient, modern farming companies,
which, in turn are key to a competitive Bulgarian agriculture. A key investment, although not that big is a
CPL Cleaner Production loan to Drujba Ad, Bulgaria. It is a CP investment involving which will
translate to energy cost savings (electricity and gas) of €286,000 p.a. Furthermore, the project is estimated
to reduce GHG emissions by 8,100 tons carbon dioxide equivalent p.a.

IFC Analytical and Advisory Program
66. IFC’s Advisory Services consisted of one project under the Advisory Services in Public
Private Partnerships Department. The mandate was signed in 2006 when Bulgaria was not yet a
member of the EU with the aim of restructuring the country’s water sector by introducing Private Sector
Partnership (PSP) and implementing one pilot PPP project. The expected mobilized investment for the
country is about US$ 220 million. Following the main principles of IFC’s recommendations while
working on the transaction, the Government of Bulgaria decided to modify the existing Water Law and
other related legislation rather than to adopt entirely new Water Companies’ Law, thus opening the gates
of private sector participation in the water sector. This process has taken longer than expected and the
project witnessed changes in the Government, which additionally delayed it. IFC extended its Financial
Advisory Services Agreement and is now working on the project at full speed, currently in the process of
engaging external legal and accounting consultants. The transaction’s foreseen closing date is December
2011.
VIII. Lessons Learned and Looking Ahead
67. The CPS could have taken into account Bulgaria’s capacity constraints and scaled back on
design and delivery. While the quality of projects implemented during the CPS period were consistently
satisfactory, the delivery of some projects experienced delays. These delays can be attributed, among
other factors, to limited institutional capacities exposed in the first year of EU accession which brought
for Bulgaria substantially increased demands on policy formulation and coordination with the EC and EU
partners. Bulgaria also gave priority on setting up EU related institutional structures—possibly at the cost
of delaying World Bank project preparation designed to support Bulgaria in the absorption of EU funds.

57

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 2: CPS Completion Report

However, the close relationship with the Bulgarian Government has enabled the Bank to maintain its
dialogue on the CPS program and carry through on delivery.
68. Boosting EU funds absorption remains a key priority and the Bank must continue to align its
strategy to support EU integration. By the end of the CPS period, it became evident that Bulgaria was
under-spending its EU grant allocation, hindered by weak institutions and administrative capacities. It is
clear now that the CPS seriously underestimated the extent of institution-building that would be needed to
achieve this objective and focused its attention on creating fiscal space rather than capacity building.
Addressing these constraints emerged as a top priority for both the Government and Commission,
particularly with the onset of the crisis, when Bulgaria began to face fiscal constraints. The Government
turned to the Bank to restructure existing projects to focus future support on improving capacity to plan
for and implement EU-funded projects. This renewed focus on accelerating EU funds absorption is likely
to continue through the next programming cycle for 2013-2020. This will require the Bank to coordinate
closely with the Commission and other IFIs supporting Bulgaria to leverage synergies and avoid
duplication.
69. Knowledge and advisory services must be the primary vehicle for World Bank support in an
EU member state with access to significant amounts of grant resources. Throughout CPS period,
lending remained modest while demand for policy advice outstripped the Bank’s ability to deliver. The
Bank’s value added was clearly perceived to be in the area policy reforms and institutional strengthening
rather than financing. Given the resource constraints in the Bank, future lending in Bulgaria should serve
as complementary financing in areas where no EU funds are available or where Bank financing is
leveraging other resources or fostering innovation.
70. Reforms in Bulgaria need clear demonstration of commitment and ownership before any
international attempt to underpin such reforms financially. The Bank has contributed in very
significant ways to the debate on reforms in Bulgaria, but has not always waited for clear signs of
commitment before proceeding to provide support to such reforms. In education, for example, there was
a strong response to the proposals for reform, and these then proceeded to be implemented with great
success. In the health sector, in contrast, there was no clear commitment to the reforms supported in the
DPL program, and there was mixed results in this sector. This CPS shows clear lessons for the Bank as it
considers future support to reforms in Bulgaria, where the agenda remains significant.

 Grades5-8 (ages11-14): net enrollment rates
declined between the 2004/05 and 2008/09
school years by 2.2 percent, but this declining
trend was reversed with net enrollment rates
increasing by 4 percentage points to 82. 4
percent in 2009/10. Moreover, dropout rates for
grades 5-8 fell marginally from 3.5 to 3.3
percent during the same period (after spiking at
4.2 percent in 2006/07).
 Grades 9-12 (age 15-18): net enrollment rates
rose from 77.3 percent in 2004/05 to 78.6
percent in 2009/10, while dropout rates declined
from 2.8 percent in 2004/05 to 1.9 percent in

 For 18+ year old: net enrollment rates (in
vocational/professional schools) increased from
0.3 percent in 2004/05 to 0.8 percent in
the2009/10 school years, while dropout rates fell
from 2.8 to 2.3 percent in the same period.
 Early school leaving is down. Percentage of 2024 year olds with only lower secondary education not
in school fell from 24 in 2004 to 16.3 in 2009
(Source: Eurostat data). Between 2004/05 and
2008/09 school years, the number of “school leavers”

National Assessments: Ministry of Education,
Youth & Science conducted census-based 4th
grade national assessment for the second time in
May 2008, and also census-based 5th grade test
for the first time. The tests produced baselines
to track progress. National Reports on these
national tests were available in 2008 and 2009,
and technical seminars with teachers and
principals throughout the country were
organized by MES to disseminate and discuss
results.
International Assessments: Bulgaria
participated in PISA 2006 and 2009, PIRLS
2006 and TIMSS 2007. National Reports have
been issued for each round of the three. In
PISA, Bulgarian students’ performance
improved between the 2006 and 2009 testing

Country Development Goals:
- Macroeconomic stability with inflation at 5.0 percent (period average) in 2005 to 3.3 percent in 2007-09
- Maintain public expenditures as share of GDP at less than 40 percent

The economic crisis led to many new redundancies, resulting in an increase in the number of short-term unemployed, while the number of long-term unemployed remained
stable, but slowly growing.

master plans for regional water companies across
Bulgaria (except for Sofia which has a concession
with a private operator). This will help identify
priority investments and plan for their financing,
including grants from the EU.

As a result of the economic crisis, the Bank took the position that the number of recipients served by the unemployment benefit program and income-tested
social assistance programs should be allowed to grow to protect the new poor or unemployed and to allow these programs to fulfill their role as economic
stabilizers.

Annex 3: CPS Consultations

CPS Consultations

1. The CPS was developed in close partnership with the Government, consultations with
national stakeholders and collaboration with the European Commission (EC) and
international partners. CPS objectives, principles and pillars were jointly developed with the
Government and widely endorsed by a broad range of stakeholders and partners. The CPS
preparation process included (i) senior and technical level meetings with all respective sector
ministries, under the coordination of Ministry of Finance; (ii) outreach, dialogue and consultation
with national stakeholders including Parliament, political parties, private sector and civil society
representatives through individual meetings, web consultations and a public discussion event; and
(iii) continued dialogue with the EC and international partners.
2. The CPS reflects Government priorities related to World Bank Group engagement
with Bulgaria. CPS discussions were launched following the August 2010 country visit of the
World Bank Group President. At the occasion of this visit, a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) to step up cooperation in the development of Bulgaria’s infrastructure was signed by the
World Bank Group President and Bulgaria’s Prime Minister. The MoU envisions a stronger
World Bank role in supporting Bulgaria to better tap into European Union funds for infrastructure
investments. Based on this MoU, the CPS features were jointly developed with the Government –
emphasizing a knowledge and innovation partnership anchored in the National Reform Program
in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy.
3. Consultations with national stakeholders took place through individual meetings, webbased consultation and a public discussion event. In meetings with representatives of think
tanks, political parties, civil society including Roma organizations and private sector umbrella
organizations, the evolving role of the World Bank Group in Bulgaria was discussed. National
stakeholders voiced a commonly shared view that the Bank Group’s value-added is its global and
regional knowledge and expertise. This knowledge and expertise should help Bulgaria to advance
structural reforms in key sectors and help absorb and leverage EU funding. While knowledge is
perceived as the centerpiece of the evolving partnership, several stakeholders emphasized the
need for complementary World Bank financing to support design and implementation of sector
reforms.
4. The public consultation event brought together more than 40 representatives from
Bulgaria’s most important non-governmental institutions for a discussion with the
Government and the World Bank Group. In a highly interactive and participatory setting, the
dialogue focused on how the World Bank Group could add most value to Bulgaria’s
development. While participants from think tanks, private sector associations, and civil society
including Roma organizations raised a broad set of development challenges, a recurring theme
emerged about the importance of (i) better and less bureaucratic EU funds absorption; (ii)
Bulgaria catching up on road, rail and water infrastructure; (iii) more progress on education and
health care sector reforms; (iv) better integration of all ethnic minorities, including Roma; (v)
increasing efficiency and effectiveness of public administration; and (vi) a “revolution” on the
“green” agenda including scaling up of energy efficiency in public and residential buildings. The
prime role of the World Bank was seen as a source of knowledge, support and expertise.
5. In order to leverage World Bank Group support, close collaboration with the EC and
key partners like EIB and EBRD is crucial. The CPS preparation process served as a vehicle to
further deepen relationships with these partners. In several meetings with the EC, including
Directorate General for Regional Policy which manages a large share of EU funds, as well as
with EIB and EBRD, the evolving role of the World Bank Group in Bulgaria was discussed.

71

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy for 2011-2013

Annex 3: CPS Consultations

World Bank relations with the IMF have been traditionally strong, and the Bank is working
closely with the IMF to further support Bulgaria’s strong macroeconomic performance. At the
sectoral level, the Government in September 2010 initiated and chaired a series of working group
meetings on roads and water, bringing together Government, EC, EIB, JASPERS, EBRD and the
World Bank to discuss how international partners could best support the Government on
respective sector reforms, strengthening institutional capacity and increasing EU funds absorption
in a complementary manner.
6. Throughout the CPS consultation and coordination process, the role of the World
Bank as an important knowledge partner was emphasized, given Bulgaria’s access to a
substantial amount of EU grant funds. This echoes the feedback the World Bank Group
received in Bulgaria through the 2008 Global Poll. The poll revealed that the Bank is very
positively perceived by opinion leaders, emphasizing that Bank Group support has been most
effective in infrastructure, private sector development and strengthening civil society. Poll
respondents evaluated very highly the results achieved through World Bank Group operations in
the country. The Global Poll also reconfirmed the shifting role of the Bank Group towards
increased knowledge provision, with Bank-generated knowledge ranked highly by 75 percent of
respondents who stated that the Bank’s data, reports, analysis, and research largely influenced
Bulgaria’s development agenda.

Annex 4: Living Conditions
and Demographic Trends

Living Conditions and Demographic Trends

Living conditions pre-crisis
1. Economic and social policies in Bulgaria during the last decade have led to significant
improvements in welfare.1 Nationally representative, comparable multi-topic household survey
data collected in 2003 and 2007 confirm that household consumption has increased from BGN
339 in 2003 to BGN 410 in 2007 (in 2007 prices), a 21 percent increase in 4 years. The rural
areas and the poorest wealth groups experienced relatively higher improvement in their
wellbeing. Households in the poorest quintile saw their consumption improve by over 32 percent
compared to only 13 percent for the richest quintile. Thus, economic growth has been largely
pro-poor. Inequality continues to remain low in Bulgaria. The Gini coefficient of consumption
expenditures has declined from 0.313 in 2003 to 0.283 in 2007, a nearly 10 percent reduction in 4
years.2
2. As a result of increased consumption and income, absolute poverty in Bulgaria has
declined substantially3. In 2007, 1 out of 10 Bulgarians were poor compared to 1 in 5 just four
years earlier, essentially halving the incidence of absolute poverty. More importantly, the data
suggest extreme poverty headcount has declined even faster, to 4.5 percent in 2007 compared to
11 percent in 2003.
3. Despite considerable improvement in welfare nationwide as well as largely pro-poor
growth, some groups have benefitted more than others from the robust growth experience
and, as a result, large and significant disparities still persist. The rural population still faces
significantly higher poverty rates than the population in urban areas. Although only a third of the
population lives in rural communities, they account for almost 40 percent of the poor – a share
that has by and large remained the same between 2003 and 2007. The fact that the
unemployment rates tend to be lower, and participation and employment rates considerably

Bulgaria: Living Conditions before and after EU Accession. Report No. 44289-BG. July 2008
The Gini index is a measure of statistical dispersion most prominently used as a measure of inequality of
consumption or income distribution. It is defined as a ratio with values between 0 and 100: A low Gini
coefficient indicates more equal consumption or income distribution, while a high Gini coefficient indicates
more unequal distribution. For instance, Gini index of 0 corresponds to perfect equality (everyone having
exactly the same consumption or income) and Gini index of 100 corresponds to perfect inequality (where
one person has all the wealth, while everyone else has zero wealth).
3
The poverty headcount was measured using an absolute definition of poverty and comparable surveys
from 2003 and 2007. To welfare aggregate used is household consumption per adult equivalent. The total
poverty headcount was estimated against an (absolute) poverty line of BGN 185 per adult equivalent per
month, in 2007 purchasing power. The absolute poverty was estimated against a lower poverty line of
BGN 145. Source of data: World Bank report “BULGARIA: Living Conditions before and after EU
Accession, September 2009”.
As all EU member states, Bulgaria also monitors poverty using a commonly-agreed methodology,
based on relative poverty and a specialized household survey (EU-SILC). One of the most widely used
indicators is the share of population living below 60% of the national annual income per adult equivalent.
Against this indicator, poverty headcount was higher but stable (indicating the small changes in inequality
over this period): 22% in 2006. 21.4% in 2007 and 21.8 in 2008 (source: NSI website and EuroStat). Due
to data collection and processing constraints, the relative poverty indicators are only available with a
substantial lag; the latest available figure for Bulgaria is 2008.

higher in urban compared with rural areas is suggestive of the concentration of the recent growth
in and around urban areas and the role it might have played on poverty trends. Also, the unskilled
face enormous difficulties in improving their living conditions. Individuals with less than
secondary education represent only 37 percent of the population 18 and above, but make up
nearly 80 percent of the poor.
4. Deep-seated structural disadvantages prevent a minority of Bulgarians to benefit more
from economic growth and social progress. People in the youngest and oldest age groups are
at higher risk of being poor. Households with a large number of children, a key feature of Roma
families, face much higher risk of poverty. Notwithstanding a substantial decline in their poverty,
almost half of the Roma4 continue to live below the poverty line in 2007 -- down from threequarters in 2003. While the concentration of poverty among these groups suggests that targeting
interventions to address poverty would be easier, the large pockets of chronic poverty have
remained resilient and hard to overcome. They thus signal a need for policies that address
underlying structural disadvantages (rather than transient interventions) and invest in human
capital to help break intergenerational transfer of poverty and exclusion.
Crisis impact on living conditions
5. The progress in reducing poverty was halted in 2009 due to the global economic crisis.
In the absence of a counter-cyclical social protection policy, poverty could have gone up by 2
percentage points (from 9.7percent in 2008 to 11.3percent in 2009).5 An increase in the
generosity of pensions and some social assistance programs during 2009 helped mitigate in part
this effect.6
6. While we lack comparable information on absolute consumption poverty, an increase is
expected, as the crisis dented average household consumption while leaving inequality constant.
Relative poverty estimates based on the 2010 Crisis Monitoring Survey (CMS) are very close to
the 2008 numbers, indicating that relative poverty and inequality was stable7. Households felt the
crisis primarily through job and wage cuts. The recession resulted in increased unemployment
and underemployment, reversing a decade-long trend; and in a reduction of the informal sector
earnings.

The social protection policy was the main policy tool used by the Government to arrest the decline in
living standards and poor labor market conditions. While the crisis unfolded during 2009, successive
Governments took significant steps to moderate the impact of the crisis to protect earnings through a
counter-cyclical social protection policy. From the beginning of 2009, the Bulgarian Governments have
been using the social protection system to protect the poorest and most vulnerable against the impact of the
economic recession. In January 2009, the Government expanded the access to and the generosity of its
social assistance system, by increasing the eligibility threshold and the benefit level for a number of social
assistance programs, and the minimum level for certain social insurance benefits. Many social minima
were increased by 10% to 40% (see Table 1), substantially above the rate of inflation of about 8%.
7
Income-based relative poverty from CMS 2010: the share of population living on less than 60% of per
adult equivalent income was 21.1% in March and 21.2% in October 2010 (no significant difference
between the two estimates). With the caveat that the CMS questionnaire differs from the EU-SILC, the
relative poverty indicators from CMS are similar with the 2008 estimates based on EU-SILC of 21.8%.

7. Who has been affected and how? According to the March 2010 Crisis Monitoring Survey,
about a third of the households have been affected by unemployment (5percent) or cuts in wages
or duration of employment (another 30percent).8 Workers from the most vulnerable groups —
those with a primary education or less, and Roma — have been the most likely to suffer from the
most severe labor market shocks, particularly unemployment. Other possible transmission
channels of the crisis – like cuts in remittances, arrears to social protection transfers, reduced
access to credit or to public services like education or health – were not as important in Bulgaria,
compared to other ECA countries.
8. How have they coped? Most households tried to cope with a reduction in income by
sending non-working family members to look for work or by seeking additional part-time work—
but only the better educated and richer individual succeeds in finding additional work. Of
households that are crisis-affected and poor, 60 percent looked for additional work, and failed to
find any. Key social assistance programs (child allowances, heating allowances and the
guaranteed minimum income program) are responding to the crisis—60 percent of the households
from the poorest quintile who suffered an income shock are receiving at least one benefit from the
three programs mentioned above.
9. How did the crisis impact on the welfare of the households? Households responded to the
economic contraction by reducing expenditures on basic necessities: 41percent reported reducing
use of basic utilities, 29percent reduced consumption of staple foods, and 8percent reported
skipping meals. As in other Central and Eastern European countries, crisis-affected households
significantly reduced expenditures on health, including stopping the use of regular prescribed

8

Approximately 30% of households reported a decline in income between March 2009 and February 2010.
These income shocks primarily through lost or reduced employment or wages —approximately 34% of
workers reporting an income shock through their primary job. Job loss that results in unemployment is the
most severe type of labor market shock and has affected 5% of workers. Reductions in wages and work
hours, a more moderate shock, are more widespread, affecting close to 30% of workers.

75

Annex 4: Living Conditions
and Demographic Trends

medications, and skipping doctors’ visits. Crisis-affected households were more likely to stop
paying social contributions and health insurance—increasing their vulnerability if exposed to
additional shock (falling ill or becoming unemployed). Thus, households that suffer from labor
market and income shocks during an economic crisis will suffer from persistently lower income
and human development outcomes.
10. As the crisis bottomed in the first quarter of 2010, household living standards show
signs of improvements in the second part of 2010. The income of the panel of households
followed by the CMS in March and October 20109 improved slightly (from BGN 516 to 521, or
by 1percent). For the households in the poorest quintile, the increase was almost 5 percent,
indicating that the recovery is pro-poor. Absolute poverty, anchored around 10percent in March,
fell to 9.1percent by October 2010. The largest reduction in poverty occurred for the
unemployed; large families; and the Roma. Households have also reported an improvement in
labor market conditions in October versus March 2010: median earning increased by 5percent;
and unemployment rate decreased from 13.9 to 11.8 percent. The distribution of social protection
transfers has not significantly changed during the period; given the good targeting accuracy of
social assistance programs in Bulgaria before the crisis, this stability indicates that the response of
the authorities to the crisis via social assistance transfer continued to be effective.

The improvement in poverty could be due to seasonal effects.

Annex 5: EU Structural & Cohesion Funds

EU Structural and Cohesion Funds

1. The European Union’s Cohesion Policy aims to achieve greater economic and social cohesion
within the EU. While it is a development policy covering the entire territory of the Union, the largest
amount of financing is targeted at the less developed parts of the EU. While in the richer parts of the
Union, most of the programming takes place at regional level (hence also the name Regional Policy), the
poorer (mostly new) Member States have mostly national operational programs, with central ministries
managing these.
2. The Cohesion Policy has powerful financing tools at its disposal─the Structural Funds and the
Cohesion Fund (CF). The Structural Funds include the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)
and the European Social Fund (ESF). The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund represent over
40percent of the EU budget. The ERDF and the Cohesion Fund are implemented through Directorate
General for Regional Policy, while the ESF is overseen by Directorate General for Employment and
Social Affairs.
3. The financial instruments provide funding to support three objectives—convergence, regional
competitiveness and employment, and European territorial cooperation. The ERDF is the largest of
the three and finances infrastructure and productive job-creating investments. ESF supports active labor
market measures and training initiatives for vulnerable groups, including the unemployed. The CF
intended for countries whose per capita GDP is below 90 percent of the EU average, finances transport
and environment infrastructure projects, subject to specific criteria.
4. The criteria for allocation of funds across member states include eligible population, national
wealth, regional wealth and employment rate. Each Member State decides on how the resources
should be divided among the regions by taking into account the geographic eligibility. The overall budget
for the current 2007-2013 programming cycle is €347 billion: €201 billion for the ERDF, €76 billion for
the ESF, and €70 billion for the CF.
5. Bulgaria’s total allocation for the 2007-2013 programming cycle is €6.7 billion—a significant
amount which represents about one-fifth of its GDP40. This excludes still available funds under preaccession assistance. .Such EU grants funds are complemented by national co-financing and co-financing
from other sources, such as the EIB, and are intended to finance activities under Bulgaria’s seven
Operational Programs (OP), reflecting national priorities. These seven OPs cover transport, environment,
regional development, human resources development, economic competitiveness, administrative capacity,
and technical assistance. Table 1 below summarizes the EU grants allocated for each OP, the funding
instrument and the amounts absorbed—i.e. payments made to Bulgaria from the allocated amount—as of
February 28, 2011.

6. The actual use of EU funds depends on each country’s absorptive capacity, and in Bulgaria’s
case, this has been particularly weak. Absorptive capacity has been hindered by Bulgaria’s
administrative capacity constraints to control and assess projects, ensure efficient implementation,
provide co-financing, and claim refund for expenditure from the European Commission. To date, only
about 11 percent of total allocated Structural Funds have been paid to Bulgaria since 2007, and this figure
includes advance payments made at the start of operational programs. The real implementation rate,
which excludes advance payments and takes into account only project related disbursements, is lower.

40

This figure excludes € 0.2 billion Territorial Cooperation Objective resources
