EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Political Context. The United Republic of Tanzania was formed in 1964 by the
unification of mainland Tanganyika and the isles of Zanzibar. It has a long coastline and borders
with eight countries, of which five are landlocked—it could become a regional commercial hub.
Its land is rich in biodiversity and natural resources, including sizable deposits of natural gas. It
has a history of political stability and a multiparty political system, although one party, the
Chama Cha Mapinduzi, has dominated politics since independence in 1961.
ii.
Economic Developments. Tanzania has experienced high growth, averaging between 5
to 7 percent, over the past decade, owing to sound macroeconomic policy, economic
liberalization, and an expanding public sector. Due to the global economic crisis, growth slowed
to 6.0 percent in 2009 from 7.4 percent in 2008.
iii.
Poverty, Human Development, and Demography. Despite the country’s high growth
rate, surveys suggest that income poverty has not declined as much as expected, especially in
rural areas. Tanzania is on track to meet targets for three of the seven Millennium Development
Goals: reducing infant and under-five mortality, combating HIV/AIDs and malaria, and
addressing gender inequality. Fertility rates remain high, making it difficult to achieve sufficient
per child investments in health and education, and lowering the country’s savings rate.
iv.
Economic Prospects. In the medium term, annual GDP growth is expected to rise to 7.5
percent or higher due to an expanding mining sector, particularly gold, and growth in exports.
Sustained high growth depends, however, on a favorable global economic environment,
infrastructure investments, and structural reforms, especially to improve the business climate.
v.
Development Challenges. To sustain high growth and to make growth more inclusive to
reduce poverty, Tanzania needs to address infrastructure bottlenecks, improve the business
environment, increase agricultural productivity and value addition, improve service delivery to
build a healthy and skilled workforce, and manage urbanization. Slower population growth is
needed to reap a demographic dividend. The country needs to continue to fight corruption and
strengthen transparency and accountability across sectors and all levels, especially in the context
of future exploitation of natural gas reserves.
vi.
Government Strategy. In November 2010, the Government of Tanzania finalized a new
five-year (2010/11-2014/15) national strategy for growth and poverty reduction, known as
MKUKUTA II (MKUZA II in Zanzibar). MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II focus on three clusters:
(i) growth and reduction of income poverty; (ii) improvement of quality of life and social wellbeing; and (iii) good governance and accountability.
vii.
Implementation of the World Bank’s Tanzania Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
Executive Directors discussed the Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JSAT), one of the first
joint multidonor strategies of its kind, in April 2007. The JAST comprised four parts: a national
medium-term framework for development cooperation, a joint country analysis, a joint program
document, and the World Bank Group CAS. The CAS Completion Report rates Bank
achievements as moderately satisfactory. Lessons identified by the CAS Completion Report and
incorporated into the 2012-2015 CAS include: (i) ensure that CAS outcomes are realistic,
measurable, and linked to Bank interventions; (ii) increase attention to monitoring and
i

evaluation, which remains a challenge at all levels; (iii) in a slow policy reform environment,
narrow the size and scope of Poverty Reduction Support Credits and target IDA to high impact
areas where there is clear government commitment; (iv) increase governance support at the
service delivery level; and (v) focus on on-the-ground mechanisms for aid effectiveness rather
than on development of joint assistance strategies.
viii. CAS Objectives and Results. The World Bank Group’s CAS, aligned with Tanzania’s
MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II and with the recently completed Africa Strategy, will help
Tanzania address binding constraints to growth and make growth more inclusive. It provides a
framework for World Bank Group support for five years (FY12-15). The CAS focuses on four
strategic objectives and eleven outcomes:
Promote Inclusive and Sustainable Private Sector-Led Growth. There are three
outcomes: (i) improved business environment and financial intermediation, (ii) improved
productivity and commercialization of agriculture, and (iii) enhanced sustainability and
improvement management of natural resources.
Build Infrastructure and Deliver Services. There are four outcomes: (i) increased
access, quality, and sustainability of electricity; (ii) increased access to and quality of
transport services; (iii) increased access to and quality of water and sanitation services;
and (iv) improved management and delivery of urban services.
Strengthen Human Capital and Safety Nets. There are three outcomes: (i) improved
access to and quality of education, (ii) improved access to and quality of health care
delivery, and (iii) improved access to safety nets.
Cross-cutting: Promote Accountability and Governance. There is one outcome:
improved accountability and efficiency of public management.
ix.
Proposed CAS Program. IDA resources under the FY12-15 CAS are estimated at about
SDR1.61 billion (US$2.47 billion equivalent). This estimate is indicative; actual annual IDA will
depend on Tanzania’s performance-based allocation. Tanzania could also potentially access
IBRD funding for enclave projects. The Bank will prepare a CAS Progress Report in mid-2013,
or earlier if required, to update and adjust the CAS program as needed.
x.
Partnership. The CAS follows the Africa Region’s Strategy by using partnerships as a
means for implementation, building on the core partnership with the government. The Bank, as a
key development partner in Tanzania, will continue to increase aid effectiveness through
partnerships with the domestic and international private sector, civil society, and development
agencies, including non-traditional donors.
xi.
Risks. Risks for CAS implementation include weakening public financial management,
which reduces the impact of public spending; prospects for hydrocarbon development, which
could negatively impact governance and fiscal discipline; weak implementation capacity at the
local government level, which impedes service delivery; increasing inequality, which could
affect growth and stability; and exogenous risks, such as weather, international prices, and
natural disasters. To help mitigate risks, the CAS addresses governance, the framework for
natural gas, local government capacity, rural development, and social safety nets.

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
FOR THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
I. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A. Economic and Political Context
1.
The United Republic of Tanzania is among the most politically stable nations of
Sub-Saharan Africa. It was formed in 1964 by the unification of mainland Tanganyika, the first
East African state to gain independence in 1961, and the isles of Zanzibar.1 Julius Nyerere,
President of Tanganyika and then Tanzania from 1961 to 1985, formed the Chama Cha
Mapinduzi (CCM, Revolutionary Party) as the sole legal political party for Tanzania. Nyerere
adopted socialist economic policies that resulted in slow economic growth, but his social policies
forged a strong Tanzanian national identity that takes priority over ethnic, regional, or linguistic
identities.
2.
In the mid-1990s, Tanzania transitioned to a multiparty system and accelerated
market-based economic reforms. The first multiparty elections were held in 1995. The newly
elected government began pursuing macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, building on
economic liberalization policies of the 1980s. Pro-market reforms triggered inflows of
investment and foreign aid that helped to spur growth, making Tanzania one of the fastest
growing economies in Africa.
3.
The country’s fourth multiparty elections took place October 31, 2010. The
incumbent president, Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, was reelected with 61 percent of the vote to a
second and final term. Tanzania’s constitution limits presidents to two terms in office. The CCM,
which has dominated politics since independence, won 70 percent of the seats in parliament.
4.
Tanzania’s geographical location is conducive to trade. It borders with eight countries
of which five are landlocked, has a long coastline, and two major inland lakes. If Tanzania can
remove infrastructure bottlenecks and improve its investment climate, it could become a regional
hub for the increasing trade between Africa and Asia and the Middle East.
5.
Tanzania is rich in natural resources and biodiversity. Forestry, fisheries, and
wildlife, though declining, continue to be dynamic and important sectors. Wildlife, national
parks, and coral reefs make Tanzania an up-market tourist destination. Mineral resources, which
include gold, diamonds, base metals, and gemstones are already being exploited, but new
deposits are expected to be discovered. Agriculture provides a livelihood for about 80 percent of
Tanzanians. The use of these abundant natural resources is characterized by low productivity,
unsustainable resource management, and the wealth has not translated into economic well-being
for more than a small minority.
6.
Corruption and accountability emerged as important themes during the 2010
election campaign. The president made strong commitments on both issues in his inaugural
1

Zanzibar has retained a semi-autonomous status, with its own president, legislature, and bureaucracy that preside
over non-union matters.

1

address. Seven high-level corruption cases involving an estimated US$1 billion took place
between 2000 and 2008, tainting Tanzania’s reputation. The government took decisive actions
that helped restore confidence, but definite solution of some of the cases remains a matter of
concern. Renewed government commitment on these issues would help address the perception of
increasing corruption.
B. Economic Developments and Prospects
Economic Developments
7.
During the past decade, Tanzania has experienced high rates of economic growth,
due to economic liberalization, sound macroeconomic policy, and an expanding public
sector. Growth accelerated from 3.5 percent on average in the 1990s to 7 percent on average in
the 2000s (see table 1 for macroeconomic indicators for 2006-2010). Growth in tax revenues,
foreign aid, and debt relief created space for an expansion in public spending, which increased
from less than 16 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000 to almost 28 percent in 2009.
Inflation was low from 2000 to 2005 but picked up pace in the late 2000s. The fiscal deficit has
been on the rise, but overall fiscal policy has remained largely prudent and the public debt
burden remains sustainable.
8.
The recent global economic crisis slowed Tanzania’s growth in 2009 to 6.0 percent,
down from 7.4 percent the previous year, although government policies tempered its
impact. The crisis affected Tanzania mainly through the export channel—tourism, cash crops,
and manufactures—and through lower capital flows—foreign assistance and private investment.
Financial contagion effects were not large because Tanzania’s financial markets are not strongly
tied to global markets. The government preserved expenditures as budgeted, de facto providing a
moderate fiscal stimulus.2 The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) continued with an accommodative
monetary policy to sustain economic activity and ease the pressure of budget financing. GDP
growth rebounded to 7 percent in 2010, up by 1 percentage point from 2009. Annual inflation
fell to 7.2 percent in 2010 from 12.1 percent in 2009.
9.
Fiscal and current account deficits have increased. The fiscal deficit after grants
increased from 4.5 percent of GDP in FY08/09 to 6.4 percent in FY09/10, mainly due to the
government’s counter-cyclical measures to mitigate the impact of the financial crisis. The
continued expansion of the fiscal deficit – it is projected to be 6.5 percent in FY10/11 – is of
concern, because the sources of funding are shifting from non-debt-creating (domestic revenues
and grants) to debt-creating (domestic debt and non-concessional financing). The current account
deficit, which has grown since 2006, is no longer fully covered by foreign aid and is increasingly
so by foreign direct investment flows. Tanzania’s flexible exchange rate management and the
high level of foreign reserves put the country in a good position to manage its external balance.3

2

World Bank support to help mitigate the global financial crisis included a US$220 million Accelerated Food
Security Program approved in June 2009 and a Supplemental Financing of US$170 million to the PRSC-7 approved
in December 2009.
3
By end-June 2011, gross international reserves are projected to be US$3.9 billion, more than 4.7 months of current
year imports of goods and services, partly reflecting solid export growth, IMF balance of payment support under the
Exogenous Shock Facility, and the SDR allocation.

* Estimates

10.
The drivers of growth over the past decade have been mining, construction,
communications, and the financial sector. Manufacturing, transport, and tourism have also
posted solid growth rates. The service sector constitutes 47 percent of total value-added in the
economy, compared to 36 percent in 1990. This stands in contrast to the agricultural sector,
which has seen its share in the economy decline from 48 percent in 1990 to 28 percent in 2010.
11.
Exports of goods and services have expanded in real terms, grown as a share of
GDP, and diversified out of traditional agriculture. The share of goods and services exports
of GDP has grown from 13.4 percent in 2000 to 23.2 in 2009, and is projected to reach 26.2
percent in 2010. In 1998, minerals and non-factor services, mainly tourism, accounted for 47
percent of exports, while they rose to 66 percent by 2010. At the same time, the share of
traditional agricultural exports declined from 60 percent of total exports in 1998 to 12 percent in
2009, replaced mostly by tourism and minerals such as gold. Manufacturing exports have grown
by about 17 percent annually since 2005, but account for less than 5 percent of GDP and 25
percent of total merchandise trade.
12.
About 80 percent of Tanzanian households depend on agriculture as their primary
economic activity. Agricultural GDP grew at around 4 percent per year since 2000, or only
around 1 percent in per capita terms, with acute droughts in 2004 and 2006. Yields of staple
crops, which are the livelihood of small farmers, appear to have been flat or declining, with
agricultural growth primarily driven by extension of cultivated areas, along with modest shifts in
the composition of crop production.
13.
Despite the recent growth, the volume of private sector investment remains small.
Private investment stalled at 10-12 percent of GDP in the early 2000s, and between 14-18
percent over the last five years. The expansion of banking services, stimulated by privatization of
public banks from 1994 to 1998, stimulated growth of credit to the private sector, which has
increased from 11.3 percent of GDP in June 2006 to 17.9 percent in June 2010. The size of
3

private investment remains small by international standard. For example, Malaysia and Thailand
had levels of private investment averaging between 25 and 30 percent of GDP before the Asian
economic crisis.
14.
Tanzania has a large informal sector. Household enterprises provide a significant
source of urban income earning opportunities, and employ a larger share of the urban labor force
(40 percent in 2006) than wage employment. They are increasingly seen as an alternative to
agriculture as a source of cash income. Policies, however, tend to focus on the creation of larger,
formal enterprises. Both types of enterprises are critical for poverty reduction, but the micro and
household enterprises can absorb a larger share of the workforce, and face different constraints
and opportunities than the large firms.
Poverty, Human Development, and Demography
15.
Surveys suggest that poverty has not declined to the extent expected, although data
are ambiguous.4 According to the 2007 Household Budget Survey (HBS), the incidence of
monetary poverty has declined only marginally on the mainland from 35.7 percent in 2001 to
33.6 percent in 2007. In Zanzibar, it declined from 49 percent in 2004/05 to 40 percent in 2009.
However, using the international poverty line (purchasing power parity US$1.25/day), an
estimated 68 percent of the population was in poverty in 2007, down from 89 percent in 2001.
Labor force surveys found that urban areas realized important gains in access to non-farm
employment over the same period, and earnings increased substantially. Survey data also show
real gains in wealth among all quintiles between 2000 and 2007 (as measured by increased
consumer durables and better housing). As a result, Tanzania ranks higher on the multidimensional poverty index (non-monetary poverty) than it ranks on the international poverty
index.
16.
Rural poverty remains pervasive and deep. All data sources suggest that Tanzania has
not made adequate progress in raising incomes in rural areas, where the majority of the poor live.
Lack of access to technology, credit, water, and power resulted in stagnant productivity and high
vulnerability to shocks, leaving many rural households in the same or weaker position as at the
beginning of the decade.
17.
Tanzania’s rank in the UNDP Human Development Index has improved since 1995.
It is now 148 of 169 countries in the 2010 HD Index. Tanzania is expected to reach three of
seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 (box 1). Tanzania is on track for
meeting the MDGs related to combating HIV/AIDS and reducing infant and under-five
mortality. It is lagging in primary school completion, maternal health, poverty eradication,
malnutrition, and environmental sustainability.

4

While Tanzania has made gains in the frequency of household surveys, quality of data obtained and consistency
between surveys and methods remain a problem. Therefore, all measures of household income and poverty from the
last decade need to be understood as estimates with wide margins of error. The government is committed to
improving the quality of data used to track economic and social outcomes, and has developed a new National
Strategy for Statistical Development. The Bank will provide support through the Development of a National
Statistical System for Tanzania Project (under the Statistical Capacity Building APL), approved in March 2011.

Box 1: Tanzania and the Millennium Development Goals in 2015
Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
Unlikely. Despite high GDP growth over the past few years, the incidence of income poverty has declined only
marginally from 35.7 percent in 2001 to 33.6 percent in 2007. Considering a target of 19.5 percent in 2015, the
poverty MDG is unlikely to be met. The proportion of under-weight children under five has declined from 28.8
percent in 1990 to 20.7 percent in 2010 but is off track to meet the target of 14.4 percent in 2015. Malnutrition is
responsible for more than 130 child deaths daily, making it the greatest contributor to under-five deaths.
Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education
Unlikely. The second phase of the Primary Education Development Program (2007-2011) provides free preprimary
and primary education. The net enrollment rate for primary school is 95.4 percent, and the gross enrollment rate is
106.4 percent. However, primary completion rates are low with 49.4 percent passing the Primary School Leavers
Examination.
Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women
Likely. Gender parity in primary (1.01) and secondary (1.05) enrollment has been achieved, and the ratio of girls to
boys in tertiary (0.68) indicates progress. In the October 2010 elections 20 women were directly elected as members
of parliament (out of 232 directly elected members), up from 17 in 2005.
Goal 4: Reduce child mortality
Likely. Under-five and infant mortality rates have declined substantially over the past five years, and the targets are
likely to be met. Under-five mortality rate declined from 191 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 81 deaths in
2010 (compared to MDG target of 64), and the infant mortality rate declined from 115 to 51 deaths per 1,000 live
births during the same period (compared to MDG target of 38).
Goal 5: Improve maternal health
Unlikely. The maternal mortality rate increased between 1996 (529 deaths per 100,000 live births) and 2005 (578
deaths). The rate has declined to 454 deaths in 2010 but remains much higher than the target of 133 by 2015. On
average, only 51 percent of births take place at health facilities.
Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
Likely. Tanzania has reduced the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate from 9.4 percent in 2000 to 5.7 percent in 2009, and is
on track to meet the MDG. In 2007, there were only 27 reported cases of malaria per 1,000 people. Tanzania could
achieve the malaria MDG target (18 cases per 1,000 people), particularly if anti-malarial interventions continue.
Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Unlikely. Tanzania has made progress in increasing access to safe drinking water. While access to clean water in
urban areas has already met the MDG target (84 percent), access in rural areas is 57.1 percent against a target of 74
percent. Access to improved sanitation is 88.9 percent in rural areas and 98.5 percent in urban areas. However, on
natural resource management, progress has been challenging. Forest cover, for example, has declined from 46
percent in 2005 to 36 percent in 2010.

18.
The uneven progress toward the MDGs is evidence of the country’s mixed record in
service delivery, despite some improvements brought about by decentralization (box 2). The
country has done well in reducing infant and under-five mortality, but less so in child
malnutrition. Maternal mortality has been persistently high at unacceptable levels, despite the
modest increase in the number of births taking place in health facilities (41 to 52 percent over
2005-09). The prevalence of HIV/AIDS declined from 7 percent in 2003 to 5.7 percent in 2007.
Challenges remain in further improving service delivery and health systems management, and
expanding protection for catastrophic care for the poor, unemployed, and informal sector
5

workers. Human resources for health, in number, skills and geographical distribution, are the
most important supply-side constraint. Other remaining challenges include the supply chain for
drugs and medical supplies, and the flow of funds, especially to the lower levels of care.
Box 2: Decentralization through Devolution
Local Government Authorities (LGAs) have had a role in the delivery of primary services since 1999. Most of
the services hitherto delivered by central ministries, including education (primary and secondary) and primary health
care, have been shifted to LGAs. The increased responsibilities have required increased resource allocations. The
share of total government budget allocated to LGAs rose from 17 percent in FY 2005/06 to 24 percent in FY
2009/10.
The government successfully established and mainstreamed the Local Government Development Grant
(LGDG) system, supported by the World Bank and other development partners (DPs). The LGDG system provides
Council Development Grants and Capacity Building Grants on a formula basis to LGAs that meet good governancerelated minimum conditions and performance measures. From 2006/07, the Agricultural Sector Development
Program, the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program, and the Health Sector Development Grant have been
integrated into the LGDG system as windows. From 2008/09 the Education Sector Development Grant was
integrated into the Council Development Grant system.
Decentralization has had a positive impact on governance and service delivery outcomes. Results from two
citizens’ surveys conducted in 2003 and 2006 show evidence of increased electoral and civic participation, access to
information, and trust in government. Corruption is still perceived as a problem. As for service delivery, in 2006, 78
percent of respondents agreed that local government reforms are helping to improve service delivery (up from 58
percent in 2003); 75 percent of respondents thought that service delivery had improved in the last two years
(compared to 54 percent in 2003); and urban dwellers were more likely to note improvements than rural dwellers.
Wage bill expenditure patterns continue to disadvantage local governments. Vacancy rates are higher in rural
areas and discretionary elements of wage bill expenditure (allowances and indemnities) accrue almost exclusively to
central government, exacerbating the gap in coverage and quality of service delivery staff.
Increased transfers to LGAs have highlighted systemic weaknesses in public financial management systems
such as multiple planning processes, multiple reporting requirements, lack of harmonization of stand-alone IT
solutions, inadequate co-ordination with central government ministries, lack of comprehensive monitoring of fund
flows, dormant bank accounts, and insufficient management of carry forward balances. All these increase the
fiduciary risk that public funds are subjected to at the local government level. Central to public financial
management (PFM) improvement is the need to put in place a well functioning incentive structure.
Fiscal transfers do not cover demand for infrastructure, especially in urban areas. Although most of the
domestic revenues are collected in urban areas, more than 80 percent of transfers go to rural areas. In per capita
terms, transfers to rural LGAs are 21 percent higher than transfers to urban LGAs. An effective funding mechanism
is being developed to enable cities and towns in Tanzania to deliver services to a rapidly increasing number of
citizens and to fulfill their role of driving economic growth.
World Bank support to decentralization. Ongoing and proposed urban and local government interventions aim to
strengthen the capacity of rural and urban local governments to provide services, establish sustainable mechanisms
for urban local government to finance infrastructure, establish mechanisms for delivering services at the
metropolitan level, and improve local government public financial management.

19.
Tanzania’s population dynamics pose a challenge to socioeconomic development.
First, population has doubled since 1985 and grows today at an annual rate of 2.8 percent. While
infant and mortality rates have fallen significantly, the total fertility rate remains high and has
been declining very slowly (from 5.8 births per woman in 1996 to 5.4 in 2010). Second, the
population is very young – the median age is about 17 – so that the working age population
exceeds that of young dependents by only 15 percent. The high dependency ratio makes it costly
to achieve sufficient per child investments in health and education and also lowers the country's
savings rate. Third, rapid urbanization stresses municipal institutions in such services as water
6

and sanitation,5 security, mass transport and solid waste management. Simulations of the impact
of population growth on per capita income show that if fertility remains constant, income per
capita growth will significantly slow down during the next 40 years, while low and medium
fertility scenarios result in higher incomes per capita and a larger overall economy.6
The Outlook for Shared Growth
20.
The quick economic rebound from the global crisis will be softened in 2011 due to
adverse weather conditions and will be exposed to external shocks from oil and food prices.
A shortfall in rainfall beginning in late 2010 caused power shortages that are affecting growth,
which is projected at 6 percent in 2011, down from 7 percent in 2010. (Economic projections for
2011-2015 are shown in table 2.) Inflation is likely to reach 7.5 percent in the second half of
2011 due to the rise of oil and food prices. While it is projected to slow to 5 percent, inflation
will remain dependent on external shocks to oil prices and agriculture production. Monetary and
fiscal policy will have an important role in anchoring inflation expectations.
21.
The medium-term outlook is positive but with significant uncertainties. Growth is
expected to rise to 7.5 percent or even higher in the medium term owing, in particular, to
investments in mining (especially gold). The positive medium-term outlook depends on timely
investments to tackle infrastructure bottlenecks and structural reforms, especially to improve the
business climate. In addition, as Tanzania becomes increasingly integrated into the global
economy through trade and investment, it becomes more sensitive to exogenous shocks from
global downturns or variable food and fuel prices, which will compound the challenge of
sustaining high economic growth rates.

22.
Tanzania must expand public investment in infrastructure with prudent public
finance policies. Tanzania faces fiscal challenges over the medium term as the government
intends to scale up public investment. One of the thrusts of the new poverty reduction strategy
(MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II), which covers FY 2011-2015, is to support growth through
increased infrastructure spending, especially in transportation, power generation, and irrigation.
Financing is expected to come from domestic and external borrowing. While concessional
borrowing and grants will remain the main source of financing for development spending, the
authorities are exploring sources for semi-concessional and non-concessional external
borrowing, as well as domestic borrowing. With rapid population growth, demand for public
services is expanding quickly in both the social and infrastructure areas. Tax collection in recent
years has not kept pace with spending needs, and recurrent spending is consuming an increasing
portion of non-earmarked budgetary resources (domestic revenues and external budget support).
General budget support is unlikely to grow at the same rapid rate as in recent years, making it
important to increase domestic revenue mobilization, improve spending efficiency, and attract
foreign direct investment.
23.
Tanzania must improve its business climate for sustained growth and job creation.
The current small market share of new, labor-absorbing export-oriented industries, together with
inadequate human capital development, creates a medium-term risk of high youth
unemployment. Growth in GDP and employment has so far largely come from domestic oriented
industries in Tanzania. Tanzania is set to produce 2.8 million secondary school graduates
between 2010 and 2015. A large supply of secondary graduates where the quality of their
educational attainments is increasingly a concern, coupled with urban employment growth that is
limited to domestic-oriented industries, creates the risk of up to 1.5 million youth unemployed in
Tanzania by 2015.
24.
Regional integration will produce opportunities for building an export base that
creates jobs. Within the East African Community (EAC), Tanzania is now a net exporter of
intermediate goods and is potentially a net exporter of consumer goods. While Tanzania’s
exports with other countries in the EAC is but 10 percent of its total exports, its EAC export
share is much higher (36 percent) for exports of consumer goods. Tanzania’s overall export
profile still shows its dependence on raw materials, which constitute 40 percent of total exports
to the rest of the world. Tanzania also aims to establish itself as a regional trade and logistics
hub, harnessing the comparative advantage of its geographical position. The government,
however, has not sufficiently invested in necessary infrastructure, as shown by the condition of
energy, railways, and port services.
Debt Sustainability
25.
Tanzania’s current risk of debt distress remains low, reflecting debt relief and
sound macroeconomic policies. In the coming years, the government anticipates borrowing
from domestic and external sources, including on non-concessional terms, to finance higher
infrastructure spending. The additional borrowing will increase the present value of debt-to-GDP
ratio but should not jeopardize long-term debt sustainability. Alternative downside scenarios
illustrate, however, that debt indicators would be sensitive to significantly lower long-term
growth, higher budget deficits, or low productivity of public investment. This highlights the
8

importance of a sound debt management strategy and rigorous evaluation of the quality and
feasibility of infrastructure projects to ensure healthy rates of return on investment.
C. Key Development Challenges and Opportunities
26.
Maintaining Tanzania’s recent growth and transforming it into longer and better lives for
its people requires harnessing the opportunities for growth, solving the key distribution
problems, and reducing vulnerability and building resilience.
27.
Infrastructure is a binding constraint to growth and private sector development.
The private sector ranks poor infrastructure, especially insufficient power supply, as the main
constraint to growth. Insufficient and unreliable infrastructure services increase input costs,
raising transaction costs, and lowering productivity. Expensive transport, especially rural roads,
blocks market access and the value-addition of agricultural products that are needed to increase
income of smallholders. Unlocking Tanzania’s growth potential depends on well designed and
implemented public investment programs for energy, transport, and water; and better
management of public-private partnerships (PPP).
28.
Reforms in the business environment have been too slow to improve competitive.
Progress in the business environment and other core reforms (i.e., public sector reform, public
financial management reform, legal sector reforms, and anti-corruption) has been limited and
uneven. Both small entrepreneurs and large investors face many hurdles, including policy
inconsistencies and long and cumbersome bureaucratic processes. Land management, in
particular the uncertainty in land tenure, continues to constrain formal ownership and access to
credit. The development of the Roadmap for Improvement of Tanzania’s Investment Climate is a
step in the right direction. However, making it operational and immediately implementing some
quick wins is critical to avoid further falling behind competing countries.
29.
Agricultural productivity needs to be increased to raise the poor above the poverty
line and improve the competitiveness of commercial agro-processing. Despite its critical role
for the majority of Tanzanians, the agriculture sector has not been performing to its potential.
Problems include low adoption of improved technologies, high transport costs, and the lack of
adequate market competition. A number of policy interventions, although some have been
designed for other genuine reasons, still continue to constrain the growth of the sector. High rates
of taxation and non-tariff trade barriers also undermine commercial growth in some subsectors.
Recent commitments under Kilimo Kwanza (Agriculture First) offer the promise of greater
coordination of public and private commitment to make Tanzanian agriculture more competitive.
The government is investing a growing share of its budget in agriculture and is encouraging
broader commitments to agribusiness development. These commitments have been confirmed in
the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) for Tanzania, which is
linked both to the Agriculture and Food Security Investment Plan and to the Southern
Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT).
30.
Improving service delivery is necessary to build up a healthy and skilled workforce.
Improving Tanzania’s competiveness depends on improving access to and quality of health and
education services:
9

(i)

The main problem in the education sector is poor outcomes at primary and
secondary levels. Increases in enrollment combined with supply-side constraints—
failing infrastructure, inequitable staff allocation systems, and a shortage of skilled
teachers and educational materials—have caused declines in quality. Also, resource
allocation within the education sector is not linked to the sector’s strategic objectives to
improve quality and equity. In particular, higher education student loans that subsidize
the upper two income quintiles are consuming an increasing share of spending.

(ii)

The main problem of health policy is low longevity caused by poor and inequitable
services. Tanzania has about 10 health workers per 10,000 people, but their distribution
by region ranges from 4.27 and 4.57 in Singida and Tanga respectively to 16.19 and
16.35 in Mwanza and Dar es Salaam - an almost four-fold difference between the
lowest and the highest region. According to a recent study on service delivery, 53
percent of medical personnel surveyed in rural areas diagnosed five common diseases
correctly, compared to 68 percent in urban areas. Moreover, just 31 percent of the rural
clinicians followed recognized protocols in reaching their diagnosis, compared to 44
percent in urban areas. Domestic resources to health have been variable or even
declining, and the sector depends greatly on foreign aid. Tanzania needs a long-term
health financing strategy that integrates all sources of funds into a sustainable financing
system, recognizing that poor people cannot pay for health care. IDA has recently
completed a Health Financing Policy Note.7

31.
Urbanization, if properly managed, can stimulate economic growth. The urban
population has grown from 5.7 percent in 1967 to an estimated 26.4 percent in 2010.8
Concentration of economic activity is desirable for economic growth, but the government needs
to decentralize budget preparation, execution, and accountability to local governments if urban
development is to achieve its full potential for growth. Policy can also do more to enhance the
productivity of household enterprises that are already important sources of urban employment.9
At the same time, other targeted interventions - notably investments in agriculture, transport, and
productive safety nets - will be required to reduce the spatial disparities in income and ensure
inclusive growth.
32.
Slower population growth is needed to reap a demographic dividend. To reduce
population growth, the country must improve its policies to further reduce child and infant
mortality and fertility (through an expansion of health interventions and family planning
coverage, respectively), and increase access to and quality of education, especially for girls.
33.
The government needs to continue to fight corruption and strengthen transparency
and accountability across sectors and at all levels. The government has made good progress in
implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which will be increasingly
important in the context of natural gas development (see box 6). Strengthening public financial
management (PFM) and public procurement is essential for high quality infrastructure
7

The urbanization rate is even higher (33.5 percent) using the population density criterion, which defines urban as
areas having a population density greater than 150 persons/square kilometer.

investments, more effective service delivery, and attracting private investment. Another
challenge is to address so-called “quiet corruption,” such as teacher and health worker
absenteeism, which is less visible than big-time corruption but occurs across a much wider set of
transactions directly affecting a large number of beneficiaries.
D. Tanzania’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
34.
Tanzania’s first National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty was
implemented between 2005/06 and 2009/10. It is better known by its Kiswahili acronym
MKUKUTA (Mkakati wa Kukuza Uchumi na Kupunguza Umasikini Tanzania).
35.
In November 2010, the Government of Tanzania finalized a new five year (2010/112014/15) National Strategy, MKUKUTA II.10 Concurrently, the Revolutionary Government of
Zanzibar finalized the Zanzibar Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (Kiswahili
acronym MKUZA II), covering the same period. MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II are based on
Tanzania’s Development Vision 2025, which aims to transform Tanzania into a middle-income
country. Though MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II build on their predecessor strategies, they are
more strongly oriented toward growth and the enhancement of productivity. The strategies scale
up the role and participation of the private sector in economic growth and employment
generation, and emphasize investment in people and infrastructure development.
36.
MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II are organized into three clusters. Cluster I of both
strategies is Growth and Reduction of Income Poverty; broad outcomes include: (i) sustained
inclusive and accelerated growth; (ii) enhanced employment opportunities for all, including
women and youth; and (iii) good economic governance and enhanced quality of social services.
Cluster II of MKUKUTA II is Improvement of Quality of Life and Social Wellbeing or Social
Well-Being and Equitable Access to Social Services in MKUZA II; broad outcomes include: (i)
improved quality of life and social wellbeing for enhancing capabilities, with particular focus on
the poorest, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups; and (ii) reduced inequities in
accessing social and economic opportunities. Cluster III of MKUKUTA II is Good Governance
and Accountability, while MKUZA II focuses on Good Governance and National Unity; broad
outcomes include: (i) democracy, good governance, human rights, and the rule of law; (ii)
consolidated and sustained peace, political stability, social cohesion, and national unity; (iii)
accountable, responsive, effective, and efficient leadership in public services; and (iv) equity in
accessing public resources and services.
37.
The IDA-IMF Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) considers the macroeconomic
framework and the sector-specific plans to be generally compatible with the government’s
vision of structural transformation of the economy. The JSAN notes that exogenous shocks
and governance challenges could affect implementation adversely. The JSAN recommends
measures to strengthen MKUKUTA II and enhance its implementation: better prioritization;
stronger emphasis on enhancing agricultural productivity and empowering the private sector;
actions to make growth more inclusive; intermediate targets reflecting different scenarios in the
10

The Planning Commission under the President’s Office is developing the first 5-year plan. It is based on
MKUKUTA II and has four pillars: (i) sustaining macro-economic stability; (ii) harnessing Tanzania’s natural
resources; (iii) establishing Tanzania as a trade and logistic hub in the region; and (iv) utilizing ICT as a tool to
increase productivity, which will require investments in science education and capacity development.

11

monitoring and evaluation framework; and clearer linkages between operation targets, priority
areas, cluster strategies, and intervention packages.
MKUKUTA II/MKUZA II Cluster I: Growth and Reduction of Income Poverty
38.
MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II cluster strategies emphasize economic growth with a
target of 8-10 percent annually as envisaged in the Tanzania Development Vision 2025. In order
to create appropriate incentives for investment and job creation, Cluster I of the strategies calls
for macroeconomic stability. The strategies identify agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, mining,
and infrastructure as growth sectors.
39.
Agriculture is identified as a priority contributor to economic growth, poverty
alleviation, and food security. This growth is to be achieved through a diverse approach
founded on the government’s Agricultural Sector Development Program and the Kilimo Kwanza
(Agriculture First) initiative. This focuses on modernization and commercialization of private
sector-based agricultural activities. Emphasis is placed on speeding productivity growth and
resolving bottlenecks along the value chains of strategic agricultural products. Priority drivers for
agricultural growth include improved irrigation and rainwater harvesting, strengthened agroprocessing, promoting science and technology, strengthening financial and extension services,
and better markets.
40.
Both strategies note that the private sector is constrained mainly by poor
infrastructure and an inadequate business environment. They call for improving the business
climate by: implementing a road map for easing doing business; establishing industrial parks;
improving physical infrastructure, such as energy, water, road and railway transport, ports and
harbors, and marketing infrastructure; promoting technological innovations; linking farmers with
manufacturers; and formalizing the informal sector.
41.
Infrastructure is identified as a cross-sectoral driver of growth. The strategies place
priority on primary infrastructure in rural areas, trunk and regional roads, constructing and
upgrading existing railway lines, transit traffic facilitation (port and maritime), and urban
transport. Reliable supply of electricity is identified as a central element of a productive business
climate, as well as an important factor for enhancing efficiency in agriculture.
42.
Other goals within Cluster I include employment-creation, ensuring food and
nutrition security, environmental sustainability, climate change adaptation and mitigation,
as well as leveraging returns on natural resources. Priority areas of intervention include an
improvement of the labor market information system, promoting affirmative action, investment
in human capital, promoting nutrition, providing adaptation and mitigation options, enhancing
community-based natural resource management arrangements, strengthening weather
projections, and early warning systems.
MKUKUTA II/MKUZA II Cluster II: Improvement of Quality of Life (Equitable Access to
Social Services) and Social Well-Being
43.
MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II Cluster II focuses on improving the quality of social
services to reach the poor and other vulnerable groups. While some progress has been made
12

in recent years, some of Tanzania’s health outcomes remain poor, particularly in maternal and
child health. The health service delivery system remains inadequate, and the human resources for
health are insufficient, in number, skill, and geographical distribution. Priority areas are human
resources for health, maternal health, and improvement in health facilities and service delivery.
In addition, the strategies recognize the additional strain placed on the sector by high population
growth and prioritizes access to reproductive education and family planning.
44.
Gross enrollment rates have grown during MKUKUTA I and MKUZA I.
Completion rates, however, have not increased and the quality of education is too low. To
address quality, the strategies focus on improvements in physical infrastructure, teaching and
learning materials, human resources, and school governance. The strategies also identify
increased access to secondary education, especially for girls, to be one of the most effective
measures to address issues of population dynamics, including reduction in the fertility rate.
45.
Skills development is identified as a priority; gaps in the low-to-medium level
technical cadre in all sectors are identified as the primary focus for improvement. Tailor-made
programs aim to generate the required number of workers with appropriate skills for the growth
drivers in agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, mining, services, and trade logistics, through
technical and vocational education and training, higher education, and adult and non-formal
education.
46.
Cluster II also identifies targets in access to water and sanitation, particularly the
construction of additional low-cost appropriate water sources. Settlement development is
addressed in the context of environmental conservation. Plans, surveys and issuance of land titles
are a priority area, as well as the regularization of unplanned settlements and enforcement of
urban land use plans. The strategic plan for the implementation of land laws aims to ensure
gender-balanced access to land. To provide adequate social protection to vulnerable groups,
MKUKUTA II proposes to mainstream social protection measures in the plans of state and nonstate actors, as well as the introduction of exemption and waiver schemes for vulnerable people
to access social protection packages.
MKUKUTA II/MKUZA II Cluster III: Governance and Accountability (National Unity)
47.
MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II recognize good governance as fundamental for
economic growth and poverty reduction. In past years, institutional ineffectiveness has led to
low absorption of public funds and poor delivery of services.
48.
MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II identify core reforms to strengthen institutional
performance and address governance challenges. Those include fighting petty and grand
corruption, strengthening public finance management and value for money in use of resources,
ensuring a credible legal sector, responsive and performance-based public service administration,
capable local government, and enhancing the institutional and human resource capacity of each
pillar of the state for the proper execution of its functions.
49.
Efforts will be made to create policy and legal frameworks in a more cohesive,
cross-cutting, coordinated, and effective manner. A mechanism for implementation,
coordination, and monitoring for results will be put in place under the National Framework on
Governance and Accountability. Other goals under Cluster III include the improvement of public
13

service delivery, with a special emphasis on the poor and vulnerable; the promotion and
protection of human rights, ensuring national and personal security, safety of properties, and
others.
E. Development Partner Support
50.
Tanzania is highly aid dependent. Nominal official development assistance (ODA) to
Tanzania increased from US$1.6 billion in 2000 to US$3 billion in 2009, accounting for about
9.2 percent of GDP and 34 percent of actual government expenditures.
51.
More than 40 development partners support Tanzania, with five accounting for
about 53 percent of ODA disbursements from 2005-2009. IDA is the largest accounting for
about 20 percent of the US$12.3 billion disbursed ODA from 2005 to 2009, followed by the
United Kingdom with 10 percent, Japan at 9 percent, and the European Union (EU) institutions
and the United States (US) at 8 percent. Tanzania is a leader in efforts to improve the aid
effectiveness based on ownership, alignment, and harmonization. The large number of donors
active in Tanzania results in high transaction costs, thereby reducing aid effectiveness.

14

II. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TANZANIA COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
AND LESSONS LEARNED
52.
World Bank Executive Directors discussed the Tanzania Country Assistance Strategy,
called the Joint Assistance Strategy of Tanzania (JAST) in April 2007 (Report number 38625TZ). The JAST, prepared with 22 DPs, comprised four parts: a national medium-term framework
of development cooperation, a joint country analysis, a joint program document, and the World
Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
53.
The 2007 CAS adopted the three clusters of Tanzania’s National Strategy for
Growth and Reduction of Poverty. These were: Cluster I – Economic growth and reduction of
income poverty; Cluster II – Improvement in the quality of life and social well-being; and
Cluster III – Governance and accountability. Within these three clusters, the CAS identified 32
outcomes and 52 outcome indicators. The Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report
(CASPR, Report number 52922-TZ) extended the original CAS period by one year to include
FY11 and updated and streamlined the results matrix, reducing the number of outcomes to 12
and the number of outcome indicators to 22.
54.
The CAS Completion Report rates program and Bank performance under the CAS
as moderately satisfactory. Of the 12 CAS outcomes, three were achieved, eight were partially
achieved, and one was not achieved (see table 3). Achievements include better roads, improved
access to and quality of electricity, better health indicators for infant and under-five mortality,
and progress towards reducing HIV prevalence. There was some progress toward improved tax
collection efficiency, increased agricultural productivity, improved natural resource
management, and improved access to water and sanitation, but challenges remain in these areas.
Access to post-primary education improved, but quality suffered. See annex 13 for the full CAS
Completion Report.
55.
The CAS was designed to provide support within a highly favorable reform
environment; but reforms were slower than anticipated. The 2007 CAS envisioned that Bank
support would be mainly through large, multisectoral Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits
(PRSCs); it anticipated that budget support would average 50 percent of total IDA lending,
increasing from 30 percent of annual IDA lending in FY07 to 72 percent in FY10. However,
reform momentum appeared to stall, and some key reforms even reversed. As a result, many
CAS outcomes were only partially achieved, and the government fell short in some key areas,
such as reducing poverty and improving the business environment.
56.
A client survey, carried out in late 2010, reported generally positive views of the
Bank’s work in Tanzania. Most survey participants believed that the Bank plays an important
role and that its work is aligned with country priorities. Most participants held positive views of
budget support but especially valued investment lending. About half of participants cited
“imposing conditions” and “taking a boilerplate approach to country challenges” as the Bank’s
main weaknesses. See annex 9 for a detailed discussion of survey results.
IDA, Trust Funds, and Analytical and Advisory Activities
57.
World Bank Executive Directors approved over US$3 billion in IDA for 34
operations during the CAS period (FY07-FY11), which included US$110 million from the
15

Crisis Response Window, committed in FY10 and FY11. In terms of net commitments, the
Tanzania portfolio is the third largest among IDA-recipients in the Africa Region. As of April
2011, there are 25 IDA-financed operations with a net commitment of US$2.7 billion. There are
seven active regional projects with Tanzanian commitments of US$204 million.
58.
IDA-financed project sizes have increased with higher commitments. The number of
operations has remained relatively constant over the past decade, ranging from 22 to 26
(excluding regional projects), with the exception of FY01 when only 18 operations were in the
active portfolio. The average project size doubled from US$51 million in FY01 to US$113
million in FY11.
59.
The sector distribution of IDA has moved toward infrastructure. About 56 percent of
commitments are allocated to energy, mining, transport, water, environment, and urban
development. About 24 percent are allocated to education and social development; 6 percent to
finance and private sector development; and 3 percent to economic and public sector
management.11 (Annex 5 provides a summary of the operations portfolio.)
60.
Governance concerns and inadequate performance against agreed actions led to a
reduction in planned budget support under the 2007 CAS. PRSCs during the period
amounted to US$810 million, 28 percent of total lending, less than the amount planned in the
CAS of US$1.14 billion, which was 50 percent of projected IDA lending under the CAS.12

Tanzania is currently between PRSC operations. When there is a PRSC in the active portfolio, the allocation to
economic and public sector management increases.
12
The four PRSCs were: PRSC-5 in FY07, PRSC-6 and PRSC-7 in FY10, and PRSC-8 in FY11. PRSC-7 received
supplemental financing in FY09 to respond to the financial crisis.

16

61.
The Bank’s program favors sectorwide approaches (SWAPs). Nine IDA-financed
operations channel money through ten basket funds, which pool resources from various DPs to
support a common government investment program.
62.
Project portfolio performance remains satisfactory. The FY10 disbursement rate was
34.8 percent and as of April 2011 it was 21.3 percent, versus the Africa region average of 14.1
percent. There are four problem projects resulting in commitments at risk of 17 percent, lower
than the Africa Region average of 26 percent.13 IEG project ratings of projects exiting the
portfolio have been lower than implementation completion report ratings (see annex 13).
63.
During the CAS, Tanzania benefitted from 48 trust funds (annex 7) providing over
US$ 99 million in grants. Most were linked to lending operations. They focused on environment
(GEF), energy (GEF), rural transformation (SIDA), community-based conditional cash transfers
(JSDF), and monitoring and evaluation (IDF). Much of trust fund support was also linked to
general budget support through the PRSC series.
64.
Analytical and advisory activities (AAA) underpinned sector strategies, investment
operations, and the reform dialogue. Analytical work included a series focusing on the
constraints to economic growth and how growth can contribute to poverty reduction. A number
of short policy notes were produced to provide clear and concise policy recommendations, for
instance in the education, cashew, charcoal, and coffee sectors. Cross-sectoral issues were
addressed through the national poverty assessments and the annual public expenditure reviews.
Analytical work also contributed to addressing recent corruption scandals by strengthening the
Controller Auditor General’s office and facilitating policy dialogue in connection with triggers
for the PRSC series.
65.
A 2009 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) identified actions to
improve portfolio performance and reduce transaction costs. Undertaken jointly with the
African Development Bank, it recommended actions to reduce procurement and disbursement
delays; strengthen project implementation capacity; improve fiduciary staffing and training;
reduce delays in fulfillment of loan/grant conditions, release of counterpart funds, and
submission of audit reports; strengthen M&E; and improve project ownership through better
integration of projects with broader government programs and increased use of country systems.
The International Finance Corporation
66.
IFC investment commitments over the CAS period (FY07-11) amounted to
US$184.6 million for 13 projects. Investments were mainly in the financial sector, particularly
access to finance for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the infrastructure
sector, agribusiness, and tourism. IFC’s portfolio has increased from US$35 million in February
2007 to US$133 million in April 2011, as it has taken advantage of investment opportunities
across sectors. In addition, by the end of FY11, IFC expects to commit another US$46 million to
support a local bank to finance SMEs, private health, and education. IFC forged partnerships
13

Actual problem projects have project development objective or implementation progress ratings of moderately
unsatisfactory or lower. Potential problem projects are those with both ratings of moderately satisfactory or higher,
but with three or more risk flags.

17

with local banks to foster joint ventures aimed at supporting its operations with local currency
financing. Those include a number of innovative projects in SME financing, Trade Finance
Facility, support to women entrepreneurs, and loan and equity investment in a microfinance
institution. IFC has also been exploring private sector participation in utilities and parastatals.
Unfortunately, its largest loan (US$44 million) to Tanzania Railways Limited has been
unsuccessful and the operator has been renationalized. IFC initiated five advisory projects during
the period with total funds managed by IFC of US$2.9 million. (See annex 8 for additional
details.)
Lessons Learned
67.
The CAS Completion Report identified the following key lessons that have been
incorporated into the new CAS:
(i)

Ensure that CAS outcomes are realistic, measurable, and linked to Bank
interventions. The JAST included an overambitious number of outcomes and
indicators, typical of first-generation CAS. The CAS Progress Report appropriately
reduced CAS outcomes to twelve. However, some of the outcomes of the CAS Progress
Report remained inconsistent with the government’s pace of reform and
implementation capacity or could not be supported by data, as shown by the mixed
results in achieving them.

(ii)

Increase attention to monitoring and evaluation, which remains a challenge at all
levels. The government’s weak statistical capacity made it difficult to track
MKUKUTA progress and accurately measure poverty reduction. The Bank should do
more to build government’s statistical capacity, given its importance for evidencedbased policy decisions. The Bank should also do better to ensure that IDA-financed
operations have effective monitoring and evaluation systems.

(iii) In a slow policy reform environment, narrow the size and scope of PRSCs and
target IDA to high impact areas where there is clear government commitment. The
CAS was designed to provide broad multisectoral support, including increasing budget
support, in a favorable reform environment. However, the pace of government was not
as fast as expected over the 2007 CAS period, providing an insufficient framework for
large, broad-based PRSCs.
(iv) Increase governance support at the service delivery level. The CAS focused on
broad-based governance reform programs, which did not progress as rapidly as desired.
Greater attention should be given to strengthening service delivery through local
government and sector-specific support. In addition, the Bank’s program could more
systematically support the demand for good governance, including through use of ICT.
(v)

Focus on on-the-ground mechanisms for aid effectiveness rather than on
development of joint assistance strategies. Tanzania has a well developed structure
on the ground to strengthen aid effectiveness, and SWAPs are widely used. However,
the development of a joint assistance strategy (the 2007 CAS), while well intended, did
not reduce transaction costs for the government or DPs.

18

III. COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY IN TANZANIA
68.
The FY12-15 CAS is aligned with MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II (FY11-15) and the
World Bank’s Africa Strategy.14 The Africa Strategy notes that African countries continue to
face long-term development challenges such as an undiversified production structure,
infrastructure deficit, low human capital, weak governance, women’s empowerment, youth
employment, and climate change. The Africa Strategy has two pillars: (i) competiveness and
employment, addressing poor business environment (policies and access to finance), poor
infrastructure, and the need for a healthy and skilled workforce; and (ii) vulnerability and
resilience, addressing the high risk of idiosyncratic covariate shocks, such as natural disasters,
through, for example, safety nets. Governance and public sector capacity is a foundation of the
Africa Strategy.
A. CAS Objectives and Outcomes
69.
Challenges and strategic pillars identified in the Africa Strategy resonate in
Tanzania, given its identified development challenges and opportunities: (i) infrastructure
deficit as a binding constraint to private sector-led growth, (ii) slow reforms in the business
environment, (iii) need to increase agricultural productivity, (iv) improving service delivery to
build a healthy and skilled workforce, (v) using urbanization for economic growth, and (vi)
reducing population growth. Adapting the Africa Strategy to the Tanzanian context, the CAS
will focus on four objectives:
(i)

Promote Inclusive and Sustainable, Private Sector-led Growth

(ii)

Build Infrastructure and Deliver Services

(iii)

Strengthen Human Capital and Social Safety Net

(iv)

Promote Accountability and Governance

CAS objectives (i) through (iii) fall under the Africa Strategy pillar “Competiveness and
Employment” and objective (iii) also falls under the second pillar “Vulnerability and
Resilience.” In line with the Africa Strategy, the CAS proposes objective (iv) as a foundational
objective.
70.
The CAS focuses on eleven outcomes. The relationship between CAS objectives and
outcomes is shown in figure 1.
B. Proposed CAS Approach
71.
The CAS incorporates the lessons learned from the previous CAS. For example, in a
slow policy reform environment, it is prudent to narrow the size and scope of PRSCs and target
IDA to high impact areas where there is clear government commitment (see section II). To
mitigate the risk of a weakening reform environment, the proposed CAS narrows the scope of
PRSCs, focuses on areas with strong government commitment, and where results can be

19

carefully monitored. This reflects a shift from the 2007 CAS, which was designed to provide
broad multisectoral support through increasing amounts of development policy lending. CAS
support will include:
(i)

Large infrastructure in sectors necessary for growth, and which can absorb large sums
of IDA and/or leverage WBG resources to mobilize private and public money through
guarantees and cofinancing;

(ii)

Operations that target poor and vulnerable households and communities with
immediate impact on their livelihoods, e.g., for employment generation or safety nets,
and/or on their income and asset vulnerabilities; and

(iii)

Operations that link financing to results to deliver tangible outcomes and achieve
accountability, such as the new municipal portfolio proposed in this CAS.

•CAS Outcome 4.1:
Improved accountability and efficiency of public
management

As opportunities arise, the WBG CAS in Tanzania can support:
(i)

Innovations to develop new resources (for example, gas development); to start reforms
(for example, decentralized finance to rapidly growing towns), or to try novel solutions
for old problems (for example, results-based financing in secondary education targeting
vulnerable groups, such as young women, or regions with poor outcomes);
20

(ii)

Focused policy-based lending where there is strong reform drive, with amounts linked
to the fiscal costs of the reforms (for example, pension system); and

(iii)

AAA on long-term problems such as the proposed 2013 CEM on The Transition from
Aid; the 2012 ESW on How can Education Outcomes be Improved?; and the 2014
ESW on The Economic and Fiscal Implications of Hydrocarbon Income - will lead to
lending operations or recommend policy changes as functions of the problems and
solutions identified.

73.
Sectoral assistance strategies as well as use and size of budget support will be assessed
on their own merit, based on the soundness of policy environment, government’s leadership and
commitment, governance and fiduciary issues, and expected impact. Progress against outcome
targets will be assessed after about two years. The strategy, lending mix, and the results
framework (annex 1) will be adjusted as necessary in the CAS Progress Report (CASPR),
tentatively scheduled for mid-2013.
74.
CAS activities will include Zanzibar as appropriate and in consistency with the
MKUTUA II and MKUZA II. Box 3 summarizes ongoing and planned support for Zanzibar.
Box 3: World Bank Support to Zanzibar
The Zanzibar Archipelago consists of the main islands of Unguja and Pemba and numerous smaller islands.
Zanzibar is an autonomous part of the United Republic of Tanzania and has an estimated population of about 1.4
million people, about 2.5 percent of Tanzania's total population.
Zanzibar elects its own president, who heads the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (RGoZ). The RGoZ has
responsibility for matters internal to Zanzibar and for overseeing development in key sectors in Zanzibar. In light of
this responsibility, RGoZ has developed its own poverty reduction strategy, called the Zanzibar Strategy for Growth
and Reduction of Poverty II or MKUZA II.
The Bank supports MKUZA II through eight projects. Under the Central Transport Corridor Project II, component
C finances the rehabilitation and extension of the Zanzibar airport runway and support to Zanzibar's Ministry of
Communications and Transport. The Marine and Coastal Environment Management Project supports the Coast
Community Action Fund, targeting Zanzibar and all coastal districts on the mainland. The Statistical Capacity
Building Project supports construction of new headquarters for Zanzibar's Office of Statistics. The Tanzania Social
Action Fund II works across mainland and Zanzibar to empower communities to access opportunities so that they
implement subprojects that improve livelihoods. The Tax Modernization Project supports Zanzibar through
assistance to the Zanzibar Revenue Board for improving collection of taxes, promotion of voluntary compliance,
provision of quality service to taxpayers, and improvement of working environment, staff skills, competence, and
motivation. The Zanzibar Basic Education Project aims to improve completion of lower secondary education with
successful performance among students in Zanzibar. The Science and Technology Higher Education Project
supports the State University of Zanzibar through strengthening capacity for teacher training, particularly in
mathematics, sciences, and languages. The Zanzibar Urban Services Project will improve access to urban services
in Zanzibar and conserve the physical cultural heritage at one public location within Stone Town. In addition to
investment lending operations, Zanzibar has received a fixed percentage from each of the Bank's credits under the
second PRSC series.

21

C. Cross-cutting Issues
75.
Governance is a foundation of the CAS. Given its cross-cutting nature, it is addressed
under various CAS outcomes. Under the JAST, the Bank’s governance support focused mainly
on broad-based public sector and PFM reform programs, which progressed slowly, hindering
sector reforms and service delivery. Under the CAS, the Bank will diversify its approach to
governance by increasing support to the subnational level and for demand-side measures. A core
Bank governance team in the Tanzania Country Office will be established to review governance
dimensions during project preparation, including use of ICT as a tool to increase transparency
and accountability. Initiatives to be undertaken during the CAS include:
(i)

Increasing support to the local government level. The Bank will increase support to
local governments, which are responsible for service delivery, to help them roll out
reforms that improve public sector management and public financial management.
Investment and capacity building will also be provided to Zanzibar, where system
design support is still essential and will have a higher impact due to the smaller scale of
the reform program.

(ii)

Integrating governance in investment projects, using them as entry points.
Attention will be given to including governance dimensions in sector programs, where
governance and development effectiveness meet. For example there will be a stronger
emphasis on PFM and public sector management in social sectors and on procurement
and anti-corruption measures in infrastructure programs.

(iii) Building demand-side measures into project design; and using ICT to increase
social accountability. The Bank will step up its involvement in strengthening the
demand for good governance (DFGG), drawing upon the findings of the recent
Partnership for Transparency Report “Stimulating Demand for Good Governance.” The
Bank will support DFGG at the country level (such as through EITI), the sector level
(such as through the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative), and the project level;
and will, in particular, explore ways to utilize ICT to increase transparency and
accountability. Civil society organizations in Tanzania have already started to use ICT
to strengthen the voices of citizens and to monitor the effectiveness of government
programs. Recently, for example, citizen monitoring revealed only partial disbursement
of the secondary school capitation grant, which is supported by the IDA-financed
Secondary Education Development Project, allowing quick rectification.
76.
The CAS will address gender concerns identified in the 2010 Gender Review of
MKUKUTA I implementation. Areas which have potentially the highest return for society in
terms of overall poverty reduction will be prioritized. Bank-financed operations will be designed
to reflect differences in men’s and women’s needs and constraints to ensure equal access to
resources and equitable distribution of benefits. The CAS will include specific interventions to
address gender inequalities in the following sectors: agriculture and rural development,
education, health, social protection, finance, energy, and mining. The CAS results framework
includes gender-disaggregated indicators whenever applicable and available (see box 4).

22

Box 4: Reducing Gender Inequalities in Tanzania
Tanzania’s legal, institutional, and policy framework promotes gender equality and empowerment of
women, with a few notable exceptions, i.e., marriage, inheritance, and citizenship issues.
However, socio-cultural barriers persist, hindering women to fully participate in politics, economy, and social
development. Despite legal provisions guaranteeing women’s rights to inherit and own property, discriminative
provisions in the law, customary practices, and informational barriers to justice, deny women the full enjoyment of
their rights.
There are critical issues with regards to women’s socio-economic development and participation:


Gender parity is almost achieved in enrollment in primary education. Other key indicators like
examination performances, and primary to secondary transition rates, are significantly worse for girls than for
boys, highlighting the persistent challenge of achieving gender equality in access to secondary education (1).
Early pregnancies and marriages are among reasons behind girls drop-outs.



Only 51 percent of births are delivered by a health professional (2). Women would prefer to deliver at a
health facility, but are dissuaded from doing so due to transport difficulties, cost (including purchase of
medical materials and unofficial payments), and inadequate quality of services. Maternal mortality ratio
remains very high in Tanzania (estimated 454 deaths per 100,000 births) (2).



Violence against women occurs widely, and often women are not knowledgeable about their rights.
Rape, physical and sexual violence, as well as economic, psychological, and emotional abuse, occur in
families and communities, in such forms as threats, sexual harassment, intimidation and battery, forced (child)
marriage, and female genital mutilation.



Women play a key role in the labor force (rates are 80.7 percent for men and 79 percent for women) (4).
However, significant gender disparities exist in the quality of their participation. Only 6.1 percent of women
are engaged in formal employment against 15.3 percent of men (4). Inequalities also endure in land tenure and
property ownership, mainly due to inheritance practices. Women are prevented by socio-cultural barriers from
accessing their full economic potential. They lack access to wage employment, face challenges formalizing
their enterprises, and have limited access to finance and justice (3).

77.
Tanzania’s growth is inextricably linked with its environment. The three key growth
sectors – mining, tourism, and fisheries – are all natural resource based, driven largely by the
country’s rich biodiversity and natural resource endowment. The Bank is working on
mainstreaming environmental considerations into the portfolio, through efforts to promote
environmental capacity building in most sectors (including notably water, agriculture, and
transport). In parallel, the Bank is also trying to leverage national and regional IDA funds, using
GEF and other trust funds, to maximize the environmental benefits of national development
efforts.
78.
Tanzania is vulnerable to climate change given that a large proportion of GDP is
associated with climate sensitive activities, particularly agriculture. As described in box 5,
current climate variability already results in significant costs in Tanzania, with regularly
occurring annual events costing in excess of 1 percent of GDP, which could grow to 3 percent of
GDP by 2030. Recent studies have concluded that Tanzania is not adequately adapted to the
current climate, resulting in a large existing adaptation deficit, which future climate change can

23

only exacerbate.15 Such vulnerability could prevent Tanzania from achieving key economic
growth and poverty reduction targets. In order to support Tanzania in readying itself, the Bank
has secured trust fund resources for a national climate change strategy. Such a strategy would
identify the key vulnerabilities across all key economic sectors, identify priority actions to
address those vulnerabilities, and clarify institutional roles in responding to climate change. All
projects will be screened by technical staff based in the Dar country office to identify how
climate change considerations can be mainstreamed.
79.
ICT will be integrated into the country program by deploying a mix of the growing
set of ICT tools to achieve sectoral goals. Mainstreaming will be achieved by: (i) continuing
support to cross-cutting ICT infrastructure and enabling environment, in particular to develop
ICT policies and institutions, to support the adoption of ICTs by ministries, departments, and
agencies (MDAs), and to promote rural connectivity through public-private partnerships; (ii)
promoting pilots of promising ICT tools across sectors with priority on areas with high
scalability potential; and (iii) integrating ICT systematically in selected sectors, where
sectorwide transformation is both feasible and critical, e.g., agriculture, microfinance, small
enterprise development, education, health, social protection, and local government accountability
and services.
80.
Chronic malnutrition weakens food security, harms maternal and child health,
blocks educational achievements, and slows poverty reduction via economic growth. The
2009/2010 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) shows that 42 percent of children under-five
in Tanzania are chronically malnourished and that many more suffer from micronutrient
deficiencies. Micronutrient deficiencies alone costs the government more than US$518 million
annually (2.65 percent of GDP), due to decreased productivity.16 The government has
acknowledged malnutrition as a barrier to economic growth. The Ministry of Health and Social
Welfare (MoHSW) and the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre have already developed a
National Nutrition Strategy for 2010-2015 that is ready for endorsement and implementation.
The Prime Minister’s office has committed to leading a government coordination effort to
address nutrition in all sectors, possibly by including a specific budget line for nutrition in the
sector budgets. IDA has supported these efforts through technical assistance from the Dar es
Salaam office and will continue to do so under the CAS.
D. IDA Resources in the CAS
81.
IDA resources under the FY12-15 CAS are estimated at SDR 1,612 million
(US$2,473 million equivalent), or about SDR 403 million (US$618 million) per year. The CAS
covers the three years of IDA16 (FY12-14) and the first year of IDA 17 (FY15). It is assumed
that the IDA 16 and 17 allocations to Tanzania will at least be equivalent to IDA 15 levels.17
Under IDA 15 (FY09-11), Tanzania received an IDA allocation of SDR 1,209 million

17
The indicative lending plan (see table 4) amounts to US$2,800 million to plan for a potential increase in
Tanzania’s IDA allocation.

24

(US$1,842 million equivalent), not including IDA received from the Crisis Response Window or
IDA reallocated in FY11 from other countries. The estimates for FY12-15 are indicative only
and can change depending on: (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the country’s performance
rating, (iii) the number of IDA eligible countries, (iv) the performance and assistance terms of
other IDA-eligible countries, and (v) the terms of IDA’s assistance to Tanzania (grants or
credits), which are determined annually and based on the risk of debt distress. IDA allocations
are made in SDRs, and the US dollar equivalent is dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate.
Tanzania could also potentially access IBRD funding for enclave projects.
E. CAS Instruments and Financing Modality
82.
IDA-financed operations in Tanzania typically use one of three instruments: general
budget support (GBS), basket funding, and project finance. A tentative lending pipeline is shown
in table 4.
General budget support. PRSCs have been the primary instrument of IDA budget
support to Tanzania since 2003. Performance against annually agreed actions has been only
moderately satisfactory during the current CAS period, with some key reform areas showing
limited to little progress (e.g., business environment, public service reform, PFM reform). Good
governance is a critical underlining principle for GBS, which was negatively affected by major
corruption cases that have surfaced since 2006. Under a weak reform environment, PRSCs based
on a broad-based multisector program will be scaled back, which could be adjusted upward or
downward based on annual policy dialogue and assessments of performance. In addition to
PRSCs, development policy operations (DPOs) linked to specific sector or policy reforms may
be used when such opportunities emerge.
83.

84.
Sectorwide approaches using basket funding. The Bank contributes to ten basket funds
through nine operations.18 The Bank makes use of its investment lending instruments for basket
funding,19 disbursing either part or the entire portion of an investment operation into a basket.
85.
Project financing. Investment lending is being used especially for large-scale physical
investment projects (e.g., energy, transport, and urban infrastructure). However, implementation
is mainstreamed within the existing institutional structures rather than creating parallel project
implementation units.
86.
Partial risk guarantee. Guarantees catalyze private financial flows in support of private
infrastructure projects. Partial risk guarantees (PRG), which have not been used in Tanzania in
the past, will be considered for large infrastructure projects, for example, for power generation.

18

The ten basket funds are: agriculture, health, water, Public Service Reform Program (PSRP), Legal Sector Reform
Program (LSRP), Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP), Business Environment Strengthening
in Tanzania (BEST) program, Financial Sector Support Program, Tax Modernization Program, and the Statistical
Capacity Building Program (STATCAP).
19
This is almost equivalent to what some bilateral DPs call “Sector Budget Support.”

Linking financing to results. To emphasize results, projects and programs will be
designed to link financing to outputs and outcomes whenever possible and appropriate. In
addition to DPOs, there are several design options to do so, including: (i) performance-linked
incremental financing, e.g., implementing subentities such as local governments receive
additional resources if performance targets are met; (ii) output based aid, a form of contract with
supplier or contractor that pays a predetermined price upon delivery of agreed goods, works or
services regardless of actual costs; and (iii) output based disbursement, disbursement amount
determined by actual quantity of outputs and predetermined unit cost (e.g., the number of
boreholes built multiplied by an agreed unit cost regardless of actual costs; the Bank usually pays
less than 100 percent). The Bank is currently designing a new instrument called Program for
Results (P4R). If approved by our Board of Directors, use of this new instrument will be
considered in new operations where appropriate.

88.
IFC and MIGA. IFC will continue to seek investment opportunities across sectors and
provide its advisory services. Currently, MIGA has no active contracts in Tanzania. MIGA will
continue to offer its political risk product for investors concerned about Transfer Restriction,
Expropriation, Breach of Contract, and War and Civil Disturbance risks. Over the CAS period it
hopes to also make the best use of its new products, the Non-Honoring of Sovereign Guarantees
and its more flexible, Small Investment Product to best serve the needs of investors entering into
the Tanzanian market.

IV. PROPOSED CAS OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED RESULTS
A. Objective One: Promote Inclusive and Sustainable, Private Sector-led Growth
89.
MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II Cluster I main objectives are to reduce income poverty
and unemployment. The Bank will support the government to improve the conditions for the
private sector by strengthening the financial sector and by expanding the broadband network. To
improve income in the agriculture sector, Bank support will help farmers to adopt more
productive agricultural techniques and will include construction of agricultural infrastructure. To
make economic growth sustainable the Bank will support the government in protecting and
managing its natural resources by financing climate adaptation measures, improving land
management practices as well as governance.
CAS Outcome 1.1: Improved business environment and financial intermediation
90.
Analytical underpinnings. The 2009 Investment Climate Assessment highlighted the two
main constraints the private sector faces: power shortages and access to finance. Ongoing
analytical work on special economic zones will continue to inform measures to improve the
business environment. The Country Economic Memorandum “The Transition from Aid”(FY13)
will analyze how Tanzania can harness its growth potential and improve efficiency of public
spending, while reducing the poverty rate.
91.
IDA-financed operations. The WBG will support selected interventions that are critical
and have long-lasting impact on the economic development and infrastructure for an enabling
environment for the private sector. The GBS framework and the PRSC operations,
complemented by a series of analytical work, will provide the platform for policy dialogue and
support to critical structural reforms for private sector development. Support to the Business
Environment Strengthening in Tanzania (BEST) program (under the Private Sector
Competitiveness Project (US$95 million, FY06) will be phased out. The Bank will continue its
support for financial sector deepening through the Financial Sector Support Project (FSSP,
US$12 million, FY06) that aims to increase household and firm access to financial services,
facilitate efficient financial intermediation, and support financial stability and integrity. The
Housing Finance Project (US$40 million, FY10) will facilitate expansion of mortgage financing.
The PPP framework development and related institutional support is being financed under FSSP.
The Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor (SAGCOT) Investment Project (US$60 million,
FY12) will strengthen the dialogue between the public and private sector that addresses key
policy, regulatory, administrative, and infrastructure constraints along agribusiness value chains
in the southern corridor. The WBG may also provide support to micro, small, and medium-sized
enterprises (MSMEs) through the MSME finance component of the SAGCOT investment
project. The Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources Project (SMMRP, US$50, FY10)
assists artisanal and small-scale miners.
92.
Regional operations. The regional EAC Financial Sector Development and
Regionalization Project (EAC FSDRP I, US$16 million regional IDA, FY11) provides technical
assistance to the EAC Secretariat to establish the foundation for a single market in financial
services in the Community. This will include: (i) regional access to finance, (ii) harmonization of
laws and regulations, (iii) strengthening of supervisory agencies toward international standards,
28

(iv) integration of market infrastructures, (v) development of a regional bond market, and (vi)
capacity building for regional financial policy formulation. The implementation of the EAC
FSDRP I (2011-2013) and of the follow-on EAC FSDRP II (2014-2019) will transform
Tanzania’s financial sector and integrate it fully within the single financial market of the
Community. The East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (EATTFP, US$37 million
national IDA, US$214 million total IDA, FY06) includes measures to promote trade in the EAC,
such as the creation of one stop border posts, the expansion of weighing stations, and the
reduction of non-tariff barriers. Support through the Regional Communications Infrastructure
Program (RCIP, US$58 million national IDA, US$42 million regional IDA, US$151 million total
IDA, FY09) will lower the costs of doing business by expanding the broadband network in
Tanzania.
93.
IFC will strengthen financial markets, particularly in terms of access to finance for
MSMEs. IFC looks to forge partnerships with local banks aimed at supporting these projects
with local currency financing, as well as developing micro and SME finance products to support
the microfinance and SME sectors in Tanzania. The Africa Micro, Small, and Medium Scale
Enterprises Finance (AMSME) Program will provide on-site advisory services to local banks in
Tanzania. The objective is to assist banks to increase lending to SMEs through the redesign of
products and procedures. IFC will provide advisory services to promote PPPs and to improve the
investment climate. This will entail advice in structuring the sustainable projects for private
sector participation. IFC will provide assistance in investment climate reform program that
covers licensing, regulatory reform and other areas tracked in the Doing Business indicators.
Through the Credit Reference Bureau Program, IFC will continue to support the BoT and
Tanzania Bankers Association to implement a credit bureau program for supervision, licensing,
and monitoring of private credit bureaus and for implementation of a credit reporting system.
The SME Management Solutions Unit will partner private sector to launch an SME toolkit for
Tanzania to provide SMEs access to on-line business management information, interactive tools,
and training resources.
94.
Trust funds. The Tanzania window of the MDTF for Trade and Development will
continue to provide AAA support to improve trade and competitiveness. The Russia Financial
Literacy and Education Trust Fund will finance the assessment of financial capability in
Tanzania to guide policy and strategy development as well as financial education interventions.
95.
Partnerships and leverage. The government and DPs coordinate dialogue and activities
for private sector development through the Trade and Industry Sector Working Group. The DP
Lead is currently the Danish Development Agency (DANIDA) and there are 13 active members.
Activities supported include the BEST program, the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation
program for Business Development Services (matching grant and cluster competitiveness
programs), and the Financial Sector Development Trust (part of the Private Sector
Competitiveness Project). The Financial Sector Basket Fund is supported by DFID and IDA.
IDA funding for private sector development, including modernization of the tax system and the
Financial Sector Support Program, has been about US$122 million which has leveraged another
US$69 million from partners.
96.
ICT for social accountability and results. Under RCIP e-government applications will
be introduced, which will streamline government to business transactions. This includes the
provision of information on regulations and procedures online, streamlining business registration
29

and licensing processes, paying taxes and fees online, and making business registry available
online.
CAS Outcome 1.2: Increased productivity and commercialization of agriculture
97.
Analytical underpinnings. The annual agriculture public expenditure review informs
support in the agriculture sector. In addition, it is proposed to analyze the infrastructure and
policy constraints to value chain development.
98.
IDA-financed operations. The Agriculture Sector Development Project (ASDP, US$155
million, FY06) established a comprehensive and coordinated framework to implement the
national Agricultural Sector Development Strategy. This focuses on improving productivity and
profitability of agriculture by providing better production and market infrastructure and support
services. This is complemented by the Accelerated Food Security Project (AFSP, US$160,
FY09), a contribution to the National Agricultural Input Voucher Scheme (NAIVS), which
targets productivity growth for staples needed to alleviate impact of rising food and input prices.
The proposed continued support for ASDP and NAIVS (US$280 million, FY13) will take into
account the lessons learned from the ongoing operations. Multiple agricultural marketing
constraints persist, including high transport costs, commodity taxation, and non-tariff trade
barriers. These are being challenged under the new Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of
Tanzania (SAGCOT) Partnership. WBG support under the proposed Southern Agricultural
Growth Corridor Investment Project (US$60 million, FY12) for this initiative will target the
growth of agribusiness investment linked with smallholder outgrower operations offering larger
productivity, and the creation of new jobs along the agribusiness value chains. The SAGCOT
Investment Project will support the operations of the SAGCOT Secretariat, grants through the
Kilimo Kwanza Catalytic Fund to facilitate start-up investments by agribusinesses in the
Southern corridor and develop their linkages with smallholders, and access to finance by
MSMEs along agribusiness value chains through a line of credit and partial credit guarantees
intermediated through the Tanzania Investment Bank and commercial banks.
99.
Regional operations. The East Africa Agricultural Productivity Project (US$30 million
national, US$120 million total IDA, FY09) intends to make Tanzania a “center of excellence” in
rice research. Progress has been made in raising productivity through increased input use and
irrigation investments.
100. IFC will work with IDA to identify actions to promote more rapid commercialization of
agriculture. Potential activities include PPPs for provision of key inputs, services, storage
facilities, long term finance to investors in processing, support to export infrastructure, trade
finance, warehouse finance, and logistics.
101. Trust funds. A proposed PHRD Trust Fund for Increasing Rice Productivity in Africa
(US$15 million, FY11) will support activities under ASDP.
102. Partnerships and leverage. The World Bank is a key member of the Agriculture Sector
Working Group which coordinates sector dialogue and encourages investment harmonization.
There are 12 members of which Ireland is now the lead. The World Bank is a founding member
of the ASDP Basket Fund that is now supported by several DPs. Bank staff sit on the Executive
Committee of SAGCOT, coordinate with the Prime Minister’s Office on agribusiness
30

development, and have strengthened ties with the Agricultural Council of Tanzania and the
Confederation of Tanzanian Industries. IDA finance for ASDP has amounted to US$155 million
since 2006, which has leveraged about US$200 million from partners.
103. Governance. The proposed ASDP II will introduce citizen report cards for monitoring
program results. The Accelerated Food Security Project uses non-state actors and community
participation at the national, regional, district, and village levels for determining the allocation of
vouchers, the identification of eligible households, settlement of grievances, and the monitoring
of input use. If this program is extended these arrangements will be refined and strengthened.
Box 5: Leveraging Climate Change for Development
Potential climate change impacts range from coral loss in Zanzibar, to coastal erosion, to declining lake productivity,
to higher malaria challenge, to loss of plant and animal biodiversity. Current climate variability in the form of
extreme events such as droughts and floods, already leads to major economic costs in Tanzania, with the economic
cost of regularly occurring individual annual events in excess of 1 percent of GDP, reducing long-term growth and
affecting millions of people and livelihoods. Such trends are likely to continue, and Tanzania is particularly
vulnerable due to its high level of dependence on natural resources. Biomass, for example, provides 90 percent of
the primary energy supply, and Tanzania’s forested ecosystems are subject to climate-related stresses; over 90
percent of agriculture is rainfed, and climate change is likely to affect precipitation and runoff. Malaria is spreading
to higher altitudes as temperatures warm. Models indicate that climate change could have net economic costs
equivalent to a further 1 to 2 percent of GDP/year by 2030, and Tanzania’s capacity to adapt is limited. Persistent
poverty, governance challenges, low access to capital, and ecosystem degradation all stand in the way of an effective
climate change response. The country’s limited water storage capacity, for example, could hamper efforts to adapt to
changes in precipitation and water supplies.
Recent estimates place Tanzania’s current needs for building adaptive capacity and enhancing resilience against
future climate change at US$100-150 million per year. Additional funding is needed to address current climate risks,
with a conservative estimate of an additional US$500 million per year. Addressing these risks and the adaptation
deficit is essential in reducing future impacts and building resilience to climate change. The cost of adaptation
increases rapidly in future years. By 2030, financing needs of up to US$1billion per year are reasonable. While less
than US$1 billion per year are now available, many development partners are creating new sources of climaterelated funding. Tanzania might attract such funding if it can tie its development objectives to climate-related
targets. A climate change strategy would incorporate climate change adaptation into national growth and
development plans, clarifying institutional responsibilities for addressing climate change across government sectors.
A corresponding financing mechanism would let Tanzania leverage multiple funding sources to address both
national development priorities and climate-related objectives. Such an approach could serve as a model for other
countries in the East African Community.
Under the CAS, the Bank will support Tanzania’s work to prepare a climate change strategy, secure funding, and
adapt to and mitigate climate change (see outcome 1.3 for further details).

CAS Outcome 1.3: Enhanced sustainability and improved management of natural
resources
104. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank has secured trust fund resources to prepare a
National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (FY13). The strategy will identify
vulnerabilities, define actions to address vulnerabilities, and clarify institutional roles in
responding to climate change. The World Bank Group, led by WBI, is also supporting a Cities
and Climate Change pilot focusing on vulnerability of Dar Es Salaam City to climate risks. The
Bank will leverage IDA funds to secure GEF climate change resources to promote new rural
energy solutions.
31

105. IDA-financed operations and trust funds. The program includes several projects to
promote environmentally sustainable growth. In the mining sector, the Sustainable Management
of Mineral Resource Project (US$50 million, FY09) supports environmental and social aspects of
artisanal and small-scale mining, as well as a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment to
identify policy changes and capacity building needs to improve the environmental performance
of the mining sector. In the fisheries and coastal zone management area, the Marine and Coastal
Environmental Management Project (MACEMP, US$65 million, including a US$10 million GEF
grant, FY06) is supporting regulatory and policy improvements to better manage near-shore and
deep-sea fisheries, the creation and management of a network of Marine Protected Areas, and
conservation-compatible community investments in coastal districts. The Bank is preparing a
GEF financed follow-on operation to the Lower Kihansi Environmental Management Project
(US$9.8 million, FY02). The GEF financed Conservation and Management of Kihansi Ecosystem
Project (US$6 million, FY12) would enable the continued support for the conservation and
reintroduction of the endangered Kihansi Spray Toad.
106. Regional operations. The Bank will continue and scale up support to environmental
management through a watershed approach through the Lake Victoria Environmental
Management Project II (US$90, FY09). The Regional Lake Conservation and Development
(US$15 million, US$30 million regional IDA, GEF US$5 million) aims to improve the
management of the Lake Nyasa basin. The Africa Stockpiles Project (US$21.7 million, FY07)
includes a US$6.9 million GEF grant to dispose of obsolete pesticides stocks, thereby reducing a
source of important contamination to soils and waterbodies.
107. Partnerships and leverage. The Donor Partner Group on Environment is led by the
World Bank, and includes nine other multilateral and bilateral partners. This group actively
coordinates efforts in the environment and natural resource management sectors. Specific
partnerships include joint financing with DFID of the National Climate Change Strategy and
Action Plan (FY13).
108. Governance. Successful natural resource management depends on the capacity of sector
institutions to work within political constraints. The Bank has started to routinely include
assessments in project design in particular in this sector. A review of institutional and political
economic constraints in natural resource management will be conducted under the CAS period.
Through the Executive Industries Transparency Initiatives (EITI) TF the World Bank will
continue to work with the government to improve transparency and accountability in the mining
sector (see box 6).

32

Box 6: Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
Prompted by concerns over transparency and accountability in the mining sector, Tanzania joined the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) as a Candidate Country on February 16, 2009, and enacted a new Mining
Act on May 28, 2010.
Tanzania has made significant progress toward the implementation of EITI standards, including publication of the
first EITI report, reconciling payments made by the extractive companies and the corresponding revenues received
by the government for the period of July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009. Launched in February 2011, the report shows a
discrepancy of US$36 million, which is being referred to the Controller and Auditor General for further
investigation.
The process of implementing the EITI includes Tanzania completing validation by May 15, 2011. The validation,
which is currently underway, is assessing Tanzania's overall compliance with EITI principles and standards.
Successful validation would make Tanzania an EITI Compliant Country.

B. Objective Two: Build Infrastructure and Deliver Services
109. Better infrastructure is vital to reduce production costs, to promote investment and to
profit from Tanzania’s location. MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II recognize the importance of
power, transport, and water in both rural and urban areas. The CAS therefore extends the existing
partnership with government in building infrastructure and in delivering services from
infrastructure to release constraints to growth. Expected results include more people with access
to more reliable electricity, the share of roads in good condition, and more people with access to
clean water. Municipal services such as waste collection, street lighting, and urban transport will
be improved.
CAS Outcome 2.1: Improved access, quality, and sustainability of electricity
110. Analytical underpinnings. Analytical support and technical assistance to the Ministry of
Energy and Minerals and sector agencies will continue to be financed through the Tanzania
Energy Development and Access Project. The assistance aims to improve sector planning,
increase efficiency, and expand electricity access. The World Bank-administered SIDA trust
fund provides support to the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) in the development of an
electrification master plan and to the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority to
improve regulatory oversight of the sector.
111. IDA-financed operations. Support to the energy sector will be stepped up to help
Tanzania expand its generation and transmission capacity, ensure scale up, and diversify the
generation sources, including renewable energy, to avoid overdependence on drought-vulnerable
hydro power. The Tanzania Energy Development and Access Project (TEDAP, US$130 million,
FY08) aims at improving the quality and efficiency of the electricity services in three main
growth centers (Dar es Salaam, Arusha, and Kilimanjaro) and establishing a sustainable basis for
energy access expansion and renewable energy development in Tanzania. The Backbone
Transmission Investment Project (US$150 million, FY11) will connect the major power
generation areas in the south with the north where large demand exists. While financing power
generation projects, including Ruhudji Hydro (US$125 million, FY14), the WBG will support
government to pursue further diversification of energy sources, including support under the Gas
TA Project (US$15 million, FY12) and the Singida Wind – PRG (US$25 million, FY13). These
33

operations will include measures to improve the electricity service quality and reliability, to
ensure access scale-up, low cost rural electrification as well as to enhance the sector’s financial
sustainability through capacity and institutional strengthening activities. This is perhaps the
sector that is most promising for PPP and use of WBG’s partial risk guarantee instruments
(including IFC and MIGA) on the generation side. In addition, Tanzania is a beneficiary of the
Program on Scaling-up Renewable Energy in Low Income Countries that demonstrates the utility
of low carbon paths by creating new business opportunities through renewable energy. An
energy access project may be considered within the CAS period. The objective of the project
would be to scale-up both, grid and off-grid energy access, building on the current piloting of
new electrification models under TEDAP. The project would be prepared once the TEDAP offgrid component has been successfully implemented.
112. Regional operations. The Bank will be a partner in the financing of a regional hydro
power generation project, Rusumo Falls (US$27 million national, US$54 million regional IDA,
FY12), that will serve Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. The WBG is also working on regional
power pools in eastern and southern Africa. Based on the regional master plans, the Bank is
ready to consider financing priority investment for regional power purchasing arrangements. IFC
will consider financing, with debt or equity, the regional Ruhudji Hydro power generation
project.
113. Trust funds. TEDAP GEF (US$6.5 million, FY08) supports the development of small
power generation and distribution, sustainable solar market packages, and photovoltaic clusters.
TEDAP GEF, ESMAP Trust Fund for SME development, SIDA Trust Fund for renewable
energy/access scale-up, and Russian Trust Fund for energy SME development support (i)
institutional strengthening of the Rural Energy Agency; (ii) the creation of a Small Power
Producer Cell at TANESCO; and (iii) the regulatory framework for small rural, renewable power
projects. Financing and capacity building instruments offered by these trust funds aim at creating
a market driven renewable energy development involving local developers and local commercial
banks. On the grid side, the SIDA trust fund and the South-South Cooperation support the design
and implementation of a low cost rural electrification pilot that could be further scaled up. The
grid and off-grid programs are complemented by Lighting Africa initiative (including Lighting
Rural Tanzania sponsored by the Africa Renewable Energy Access Program( AFREA)) that aims
at facilitating affordability and access of the poor to modern, clean and low-cost lighting
products. AFREA is also supporting capacity development for gender mainstreaming in the
Rural Energy Agency. The Nile Basin trust fund provides support for regional power trade
project including basin-wide study of power development options and trade opportunities.
114. Partnerships and leverage. The Bank leads the Energy Sector Working Group, which
includes six active multilateral and bilateral members. As a result of the close collaboration
among partners, an IDA credit of US$150 million (FY11) has leveraged US$300 million for the
Backbone Transmission Investment Project (FY11). Additional partners in energy include the
Millennium Challenge Corporation, the EU, Finland, UNDP, and France; work with those
partners is prominent in non-lending services, notably working with the Tanzanian regulator,
EWURA, on sustainable tariffs.
115. Governance. The energy sector is vulnerable to bad governance also because of the scale
and complexity of the contracts involved. The Bank will work to improve energy sector
governance in two ways. First, at the project level, it will conduct ex-ante and ex-post
34

procurement reviews of contracts in all new and on-going operations that receive World Bank
financial or technical support. Second, at the sectoral partnership level, the Bank will lead
through the Energy Sector Development Partners Group to improve the transparency of public
energy transactions, especially those involving PPPs, and will work to strengthen public
oversight of energy sector policy, especially with respect to pricing and sectoral budgets.
CAS Outcome 2.2: Increased access and quality of transport
116. Analytical underpinnings. The World Bank will continue to support the national
Transport Sector Investment Program. The technical assistance provided under ongoing IDA
operations and Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) are building sector plans
in rural roads, railways, and ports by identifying investment needs and operational efficiency
measures.
117. IDA-financed operations. The Central Transport Corridor Project II (CTCP II, US$190
million, FY08) and Transport Sector Support Project (TSSP, US$270 million, FY10) are
rehabilitating trunk roads and airports (Bukoba, Kigoma, Tabora, and Zanzibar). New operations
during the CAS period will support high priority investments identified WBG considers
additional financing to CTCP II (US$30 million, FY12) and TSSP (US$60 million, FY12) to
finance Dar es Salaam urban transport, and to modernize the Zanzibar airport, respectively. The
WBG would continue financing the second phase of the TSSP (US$180 million, FY15). A highpriority operation is the Emergency Railroads Rehabilitation Project (US$150 million, proposed
for FY12) which will improve rail performance and increase Tanzania Railways Limited’s
market share within the transport sector by rehabilitating railway infrastructure and renewing
rolling stock.
118. The World Bank Group is also ready to assist Tanzania in studying the net economic,
environmental, and social benefits of alternatives to the Northern Serengeti Road, if the
government should request such assistance. The World Bank Group is, moreover, willing to
support Tanzania in selecting and, where appropriate, financing the most beneficial alternative to
the Northern Serengeti Road to meet the development needs of northern Tanzania, while
preserving the unique character of the Serengeti.
119. Regional operations. The multisectoral East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation
Project (EATTFP, US$37 million national IDA, US$214 million total IDA, FY06) aims at (i)
improving the trade environment through the effective implementation of the EAC Customs
Union Protocol and (ii) enhancing transport and logistics services efficiency along key corridors
by reducing non tariff barriers and uncertainty of transit time. The South Africa Trade and
Transport Facilitation Project (SATTFP, US$35 million national, US$50 million regional IDA,
FY13) seeks to improve the transport infrastructure and reduce non-tariff barriers within the
north-south corridor.
120. Partnerships and leverage. Coordination of the transport sector is done through the
Infrastructure Working Group, currently led by the EU on the DP side, comprising AfDB,
Denmark, DFID, Japan, Korea, and the World Bank.
121. Governance. The transport sector has been affected by weaknesses in the commitment
control and procurement systems. The design of new Bank-financed operations will include a
35

review of sector management systems. Action plans to address commitment control,
procurement, and accountability and oversight mechanisms will be prepared accordingly. The
Bank will also work with the government to include all Bank-financed transport projects in the
Construction Sector Transparency (CoST) initiative (see box 7).
Box 7: Construction Sector Transparency Initiative
Infrastructure projects make a major contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction. However,
mismanagement and corruption during the planning, implementation, and monitoring of construction projects can
undermine the expected social and economic benefits.
The Construction Sector Transparency (CoST)* initiative aims to increase accountability of procuring bodies and
construction companies for the cost and quality of public-sector construction projects. Control is facilitated through
access to facts about construction projects – purpose, specifications, construction process, completion, budget, etc. –
and non-compliance can be revealed.
Tanzania is one of seven pilot countries under the initiative since 2008. The first public disclosure of project
information was made in February 2011 for six government projects. The Bank will work with the government to
include all Bank-financed projects under the disclosure norms of the CoST initiative.
*CoST is supported by DFID and the World Bank.

CAS Outcome 2.3: Increased access and quality of water and sanitation services
122. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank will conduct a water sector review reflecting
lessons learned from the Water Sector Development Program (WSDP) and assess suitable scope
and modalities of the future IDA support. The review will assess the options for improving urban
water utilities performance and facilitating legal/institutional reforms of the Dar es Salaam Water
and Sewerage Authority and the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Corporation.
123. IDA-financed operations. Comprehensive and coordinated support to the water sector
has been provided to the sectorwide WSDP through the Water Sector Support Project (US$250
million, FY13). The program is the largest and most complex SWAP operation in Tanzania,
involving over 300 implementing entities with US$1,200 million over five years. Recent
implementation reviews and a Special Audit by the Controller and Auditor General have
identified serious accountability issues and a number of weaknesses in planning, implementation,
reporting, and oversight. While good progress has been made to date to address those
weaknesses, future support in the sector would be contingent on resolution of those issues
identified. Due to the size and complexity of the sector, an option to use multiple operations or
focus on strategic investments (e.g., Kidunda dam and Kimbiji Aquifer for Dar es Salaam) under
the umbrella SWAP framework may be explored to keep each operation more focused and
manageable.
124. Trust funds. The Bank-executed Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) (about US$1
million annually) has been supporting the government in testing promising approaches and
delivery models to improve household sanitation facilities and handwashing behaviors in 10 rural
districts. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, a National Sanitation Campaign,
targeting 1.3 million households over four years, will build on these experiences with WSP and
partners providing technical assistance and capacity building support. Nile Basin Initiative trust
fund provides support through the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program for
conducting studies for future multipurpose water resources investment schemes.
36

125. Partnerships and leverage. The Bank is the lead development partner for water. In
particular, the Bank is working closely with DPs for the WSDP basket. The Bank is also working
with other partners, such as EU, GIZ, JICA, Switzerland, Norway, USAID, MCC, UNICEF, and
non-governmental organizations, for example, Tanzania Water and Sanitation Network
(TAWASANET). IDA support to water (US$200 million, FY07) leverages another US$200
million of DP support to that basket.
126. Governance. Given the governance challenge in the sector the Bank will further
strengthen transparence and accountability in the sector. The annual technical audit by an
independent entity of the outputs from the WSDP focuses on the equitable budget allocation,
community voice in decision making, equitable distribution of infrastructure, and access to
water. The MoW is undertaking a Water Point Mapping Survey to enhance monitoring and
evaluation, facilitate data sharing and make the planning of water schemes more participatory
and transparent. A citizen report card will be completed in Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Arusha, and
Mwanza to establish citizens’ views on access, quality, reliability, costs, and satisfaction of
regulated services.
CAS Outcome 2.4: Improved management and delivery of urban services
127. Analytical underpinnings. The World Bank has been engaged in the urban and local
government sector for more than a decade. Proposed operations will build on this experience and
will take lessons from past operations into account. Future analytical work by the Bank or
government will review local government financing mechanisms and an impact analysis of urban
infrastructure projects on the local and hinterland economy.
128. IDA-financed operations. Investment to upgrade urban infrastructure will be scaled up
from selected cities (Strategic Cities (US$163 million, FY10) and Zanzibar Urban Services
(ZUSP, US$38 million, FY11) projects) to nationwide (Local Government Support Project II
(LGSP II, US$190 million, FY13) and DSM Metropolitan Development Project (DMDP, US$75
million, FY13). The proposed LGSP II will introduce a results-based approach to investments in
eleven municipal councils through an urban infrastructure grant system (i.e., all municipal
councils in Tanzania excluding the three in Dar es Salaam and the seven supported by TSCP).
The proposed DMDP will strengthen the metropolitan governance arrangements for Dar es
Salaam, improve urban management systems for service delivery, and ensure increased
investments in both cross-cutting and local urban infrastructure.
129. Partnerships and leverage. The international partnership with the government is
coordinated through the Local Government Development Partners Group, including Belgium,
Germany, Ireland, Japan, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, United Nations, and the World Bank. In
the urban sector, Denmark provides parallel financing (US$12.5 million) for the TSCP and KfW
coordinates with the Bank on the ZUSP. Several development partners have confirmed interest in
assisting LGSP II.
130. Governance. In terms of supply side governance, the CAS emphasizes the importance of
shifting support to cross-cutting public management systems (in particular public financial
management and public sector management) from the central to the local level, in order to ensure
that instruments and policy tools designed to strengthen these systems are applied where they
37

matter most in public service delivery. Future local government operations will include capacity
building through performance management instruments and financial planning and management.
131. In terms of demand side governance, our urban work will support transparency, access to
information, and community participation in the design and implementation of its programs.
Grant allocations are published in newspapers and are also available on the Prime Minister’s
Office – Regional and Local Government Administration’s website along with annual
expenditure statements. The Community Infrastructure Upgrading Program in the three
municipal councils of Dar es Salaam uses an extensive process of community participation in the
planning for use of funds, in supervision of works, compensation, and dispute resolution.
132. ICT for social accountability. The Zanzibar Urban Services Project will use ICT tools
to gather citizen votes on urban services such as waste collection and street lightening. It is
planned to establish a public domain urban infrastructure map highlighting locations as well as
characteristics of urban roads. To enhance the accountability of municipalities and LGAs, LGSP
II will finance computerized public financial management systems which will improve the
timeliness and accuracy of financial information, make public servants accountable, and enhance
the development effectiveness of investments.
C. Objective Three: Strengthened Human Capital and Social Safety Net
133. The Bank’s support aims at building a healthy and skilled population base that is better
prepared for the changing economy, while reducing vulnerability. This is in line with the
MKUKUTA II and MKUZA II emphasis on investment in human capital. In education expected
results are increased secondary enrollment and completion rates, with particular attention to
girls’ schooling. To decrease maternal mortality, expected health care results include a higher
percentage of deliveries taking place in health facilities. To protect the most vulnerable, the CAS
aims to increase the income of targeted beneficiaries.
CAS Outcome 3.1: Improved access to and quality of education
134. Analytical underpinnings. Bank Group studies in education have focused on policy
notes covering equity at the primary level, fiscal aspects of rapid secondary expansion,
sustainability of higher education loans, service delivery, and public expenditure management.
Results of a 2010 education public expenditure tracking survey are being used to design
capitation grant systems. New analytical work includes an education sector review “How can
Education Outcomes be Improved” (FY12). In addition, the HD-governance team will study
Performance Improvement in Management of Education during FY12 as an input to the design
of the potential SEDP II – Additional Financing.
135. IDA-financed operations. The Secondary Education Development Project II (SEDP II,
US$150 million, FY10) aims to raise the quality of secondary education in the mainland by
supplementing government resources for capitation grants to all schools and school rehabilitation
so that all schools meet minimum standards. The Zanzibar Basic Education Project (US$42
million, FY07) is helping to improve access and quality of basic education. IDA supports higher
education through a Science and Technology Higher Education Project (STHEP, US$100
million, FY08), which provides grants to universities and assists higher education reforms.
38

Effectiveness of SEDP II and government’s will to implement agreed reforms - student and
teacher performance standards, use of capitation grants - will be assessed in FY12 to determine if
they can be expanded during a second phase of SEDP II. The second phases of SEDP II
(US$150 million, FY14) and STHEP (US$120 million, FY14) will also aim at enhancing skills
beyond the traditional tracks. This will be achieved through: vocational skills development for
lower secondary graduates who do not proceed to upper secondary (a trigger for APL2 under
SEDP II is the development of the first national plan for vocational skills development expected
in 2012); improved linkages between labor market skill requirements and the curriculum/
programs offered at tertiary education institutions.
136. The quality of secondary education is a constraint to economic and social development in
Tanzania. As secondary enrollment has risen rapidly from 10 percent in 2005 to nearly 30
percent in 2010, quality indicators have not improved.20 IDA therefore proposes Additional
Financing for SEDP II in an amount of US$50 million to support interventions for quality
education. These interventions, which might include scholarships for girls and other
marginalized groups or scholarships to private secondary schools, would be targeted to the
districts with the lowest indicators of secondary education quality.
137. Regional operations. IDA will support the Tanzanian goal of developing Arusha into a
world center of excellence in higher education in the region under the next phase of the Science
and Technology Higher Education Project (US$120 million, FY14). The project will finance the
development of the Arusha campus of the African Institute of Science and Technology. The
proposed second phase will also support the Arusha campus of the Aga Khan University, subject
to agreement on modalities of support between the Government of Tanzania and the Aga Khan
Development Network.
138. IFC will promote private education with finance and advisory services. IFC will leverage
the AMSME program with local banks to provide access to finance for schools. The program
targets to support private educational institutions (primary, secondary, and tertiary) to access
long term finance and technical assistance. The advisory services program will provide support
at three levels: (i) self diagnostics and business plan development in order to access loans from
banks; (ii) sector wide workshops that will cover areas such as strategic planning, finance and
accounting management, human resource management, school marketing, corporate governance
and administrative systems, education management information systems; and (iii) improve the
capacity of local private schools associations to address any operating environment issues.
139. Trust funds. Regional trust funds are providing technical assistance in strategy
development for early childhood development as well as for ICT skills development for the new
economy.
140. Partnerships and leverage. The Education Sector Development Partners Group is
currently led by Canada, with six active members, including the World Bank. Education partners
collaborate with civil society organizations such as Twaweza and HakiElimu. Funding from the

20

A recent Uwezo assessment in 38 of the 133 districts covering a total of 42,033 children in 22,800
households found that, based on examination results among form IV leavers, division III and above pass rates
have been falling since 2006, and currently stand at only about 10 percent.

39

Development Grant Facility to UWEZO promotes an independent institution to assess learning
outcomes in Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. The approach helps civil society organizations
(CSOs) to raise the issue of education quality and builds an agenda for reforms.
141. Governance. Considering the complexity of governance issues in the sector, an
assessment will be undertaken to identify the issues in school management and teacher
incentives system and recommend institutional development and governance interventions,
consistent with political economy constraints and opportunities, to improve learning outcomes in
education.
142. ICT for social accountability and results. Under the Science and Technology Higher
Education Project, the use of ICT in the following areas will be explored: (i) improving financial
sustainability of student loans scheme by using mobile money repayments, disbursements, and
integrated accounting for loan beneficiaries; (ii) strengthening accountability by using an
automated grievance redress services for students to provide feedback on loan board efficiency
or university performance; and (iii) enhancing efficiency by introducing MIS to harmonize
university accreditation, registration, and student loans databases. The introduction of a feedback
mechanism will be explored. It would allow students to provide information data pertaining to
national accreditation requirements. The Secondary Education Development Project (SEDP II)
will consider opportunities to geocode school locations and employ mobile phone based
feedback from either supervision teams or citizens reporting on milestone compliance.
CAS Outcomes 3.2: Improved access to and quality of health services
143. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank’s current engagement in the health sector is
anchored in a rich and varied knowledge base. This includes an independent evaluation of the
health sector wide approach in 2007, plus annual health Public Expenditure Reviews and Health
Sector Performance Profile Reports, and the recent joint Bank-Africa Economic Research
Consortium Study on Service Delivery Indicators. The support for nutrition is based on the
December 2007 Bank study: Advancing Nutrition for Long-term Equitable Growth, as well as
the Bank-financed Fortification Action Plan, which was jointly developed with the National
Food Fortification Alliance. The Health Financing Policy Note (FY11) will support the
development of the government’s Health Financing Strategy. It highlights the fragmentation of
Tanzania’s health financing system, with many different financiers and modes of financing.
Future technical assistance will explore ways of integrating existing basket funds into the overall
LGDG framework, with the aim of streamlining financial support and increasing its
predictability at the local government level.
144. IDA-financed operations. Having assisted the sectorwide approach through a basket
fund over the past eleven years, the proposed Basic Health Services Project (US$100 million,
FY12) will review the effectiveness of the current approach, introduce mechanisms to link
financing to performance and results, with a particular focus on maternal health. The project will
build a foundation to integrate the health basket to government’s broader agenda for
decentralization and the PFM Reform Program. Later in the CAS period, consolidation of LGAlevel support to social services (basic education and health, rural water and sanitation) could be
considered through a creation of a basic service grant window (for recurrent expenses vis-à-vis
the capital expenditures under the Local Government Development Grant). This project will
40

continue to support priority interventions at the local level, including those which promote
maternal and child health, as well as improved family planning coverage.
145. Regional operations. The objective of the East Africa Public Health Laboratory
Strengthening Project (US$63.7 million, FY10) is to establish a regional network of efficient,
high quality, accessible public health laboratories for the diagnosis and surveillance of
tuberculosis and other communicable diseases.
146. Trust funds. A JSDF trust fund is in place to explore sustainable mechanisms for making
food fortification available in rural areas of Tanzania, which will not be covered by the national
food fortification program. DFID is considering support to the program through a parallel trust
fund.
147. Partnerships and leverage. The health sector partnership coordinates sector dialogue
and investments through a sectoral working group. Eleven members of that working group
contribute to the Health Basket: Canada, Denmark (lead from July 2011), Germany, Ireland,
Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, One UN, UNFPA, UNICEF, and World Bank (lead until
June 2011). The US and the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria contribute
substantially to targeted programs. In 2010/11 the Global Fund gave US$225 million or 49
percent of the total MoHSW budget. US funding for PEPFAR is not included in the government
budget, and was expected to reach US$358 million for the US fiscal year which ended
September 30, 2010. Other US commitments are expected to total US$80 million, for an overall
US total of US$438 million. FY11 funding is expected to remain at similar levels. IDA
contributions to the health basket since 2001 have been US$109.7 million which we estimate has
leveraged another US$450 million from partners.
148. Governance. Bank support in the health sector emphasizes budget and human resource
management. Analytical work in 2010 on equity in service delivery highlighted the strong
disparities between central, rural and remote areas when availability and quality of health
services is concerned.21 The performance incentives built into the Health Sector Development
Grant for LGAs will be improved to focus on results in service delivery, improvements in supply
chain management, and staffing.
149. ICT for social accountability and results. The proposed Basic Health Services Project
will support improving accuracy and timeliness of reporting, including through the use of mobile
technology. This would also facilitate improved diagnostics to assist field level health workers.
The use of mobile phone technology for verification of the authenticity of high value drugs will
also be considered. RCIP provides support to the implementation of a telemedicine system for
the Muhimbili National Hospital and for an e-procurement pilot at the medical stores department.
CAS Outcome 3.3: Improved access to safety nets
150. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank’s support is informed by the social safety net
review Poverty, Growth, and Public Transfers: Options for a National Productive Safety Net
Program. The report highlights that productive safety nets can accelerate poverty reduction,

21

World Bank: Equity in Public Services in Tanzania and Uganda. 2010.

41

especially since a large share of the population are clustered around the poverty line. Existing
programs, however, cover only a small portion of the poor, suffer from overlap, duplication, and
leakage, and in many cases are not designed in ways which can achieve household poverty
reduction objectives.
151. IDA-financed operations. The Bank has supported the government’s social protection
efforts in the past ten years through financing the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF). The
Third Tanzania Social Action Fund Project (TASAF III, US$220 million, FY12) will build on this
experience. It will support the establishment of the main building blocks for a new
comprehensive, nationwide safety net program. It aims at improving incomes of poor rural and
urban households, while smoothing consumption. The project will support three interventions: (i)
public works program, (ii) cash transfers, and (iii) community savings and investments
promotion. The Pension DPO (US$150 million, FY12, US$120 million, FY15) aims to secure the
sustainability of the system on the mainland. The CAS supports the first two of the three phases
of the programmatic DPO.
152. Trust funds. The Rapid Social Response MDTF (US$2 million, FY12) will improve the
government’s capacity to provide support to the most vulnerable.
153. ICT for social accountability and results. TASAF III will explore the use of ICT to
scale up, improve efficiency, and gain economies of scale. It will explore the feasibility of using
(i) using mobile money for works and conditional cash transfers, (ii) mobile applications to
register conditionality criteria for conditional cash transfers (e.g., mobile applications allowing
teachers to report student attendance), (iii) geo-tagging of project components and assets, (iv)
SMS based citizen feedback and verification for whistle blowing and anti-corruption, and (v)
MIS for greater efficiency.
154. Partnerships and leverage. The AfDB, DFID, and the World Food Program have
indicated their interest to co- or parallel finance TASAF III.
D. Objective Four: Promote Accountability and Governance
155. The Bank will support selective interventions where it has a comparative advantage that
is public financial management, public service reform, and decentralization. Expected results
will include increased share of timely transfers to participating LGAs, improved performance of
MDAs and service delivery, as well as increased budget transparency at local and central levels.
CAS Outcome 4.1: Improved accountability and efficiency of public management
156. Analytical underpinnings. Analytical work in critical sectors will be carried out to
enhance sectoral governance dialogue. It will include work on political economy in sectors,
institutional capacity and arrangements, demand side governance, and third party monitoring.
This will complement ongoing work on public service recruitment, deployment, and wage bill
management, and their linkage to effective service delivery in the social sectors.
157. IDA-financed operations. In order to better focus support to cross-cutting governance
systems, support to the development of central management instruments and tools will be
clustered in the Performance, Results, and Accountability Project (PRAP, US$40 million, FY08).
42

After the proposed restructuring the project will include a central support mechanism for PFM
and public sector management (PSM). The focus will be on public sector pay reform,
performance management, leadership and records management, the management of budget
preparation and executions, internal and external audit and financial control and procurement
reform. Support under the restructured PRAP will also include a new component to support
central and local level public management reforms in Zanzibar.
158. Budget support operations will continue to support the implementation of critical PFM
and PSM instruments. The proposed Local Government Support Project II (US$190 million,
FY13) will support PFM and performance management at the LGA level, which is expected to
have a positive effect on the quality of service delivery. The Statistical Capacity Building
Project (STATCAP, US$30 million, FY11) will assist government to improve availability and
quality of statistical data and strengthen its capacity. Further support will only be considered if
credible reform agenda with tangible outputs gets sufficient traction under strong leadership.
RCIP supports the improvement of government’s efficiency and transparency through egovernment applications. The project finances extension of coverage and access to ICT services
in rural areas using PPP arrangements, provision of ICT connectivity and equipment for MDAs,
and implementation of several e-government applications.
159. Trust Funds. Through the EITI TF, the World Bank will continue to support the
government to maintain EITI compliant status. The PSIA TF (US$50,000) will finance third
party monitoring of CAS results.
160. ICT for social accountability and results. Strengthening of local government
management is a key to enhanced governance and accountability. ICT can be deployed to
modernize planning, budgeting, financial management, procurement, reporting and other systems
of local government. Systematic integration of ICT would help make local governments more
transparent and accountable. ICTs could be also used to promote accountability and good
governance by incentivizing local constituencies and adequately responding to local resident
concerns.
161. Partnership and leverage. The public service and public financial management reform
agenda are supported and coordinated through the government’s Public Service Reform Program
and the Public Financial Management Reform Program. The Public Financial Management
Development Partner Group is chaired by the EU. Other active partners are DFID, Norway,
Finland, Sweden, Ireland, IMF East Africa Technical Assistance Center, Japan, AfDB, USAID,
Germany, Canada, and the World Bank. The World Bank is the lead donor of the Public Sector
Reform Program Working Group. DFID and Canada contribute to the PSRP. IDA has committed
US$50 million to the two basket funds and leveraged US$100 million from partners.
E. Implementing and Monitoring the Country Assistance Strategy
162. Bank-financed investment operations use Tanzania's national financial management
systems, in line with the Accra Agenda for Action and consistent with World Bank financial
management policy. The Bank supports ten basket fund operations, in partnership with other
donors. These projects use government systems for budgeting, disbursement, accounting, internal
audit, reporting, and oversight. Sectoral operations such as SEDP II also use government systems
43

for disbursement, internal audit, reporting, and auditing. All Bank-financed investment projects
are incorporated in the annual budget and audited by the Office of the Auditor General. There are
operational challenges in these projects and capacity building is an ongoing task that is supported
through the projects themselves as well as through the joint donor Public Financial Management
Reform Program. As for procurement, all Bank-financed contracts procured through national
competitive bidding procedures use country systems. Inadequate procurement capacity is a
problem especially in local governments; this capacity issue is being addressed through the work
of Bank procurement expertise in the Dar es Salaam office.
163. The Bank will maintain a decentralized and high-capacity Tanzania country office.
Of 25 active operations, 21 are supervised by task team leaders based in the country office. The
Bank office in Dar es Salaam includes a Country Director, a Sector Leader for Sustainable
Development and a Sector Leader for Human Development. Senior fiduciary staff (financial
management, procurement, and safeguards) are based in the Tanzania country office. In total, the
office currently comprises more than 80 staff and consultants, including one staff member from
IFC.
164. Multisectoral approaches will continue to be used in designing and implementing
the Bank’s work. In addition to the PRSC series and the annual public expenditure review,
which are multisectoral by definition, there are a number of ongoing projects and programs that
are traditionally sectoral but have already incorporated multisectoral elements in the Bank’s
work program. These include the areas of climate change strategy, education, energy, financial
sector development, and nutrition. For example, the Tanzania Energy Development and Access
Project applies the Sustainable Solar Market Package to improve energy access in some rural
areas in Tanzania, providing solar electricity services provided to their health centers and schools
including staff quarters, street lights, homes, and private businesses. The conditional cash
transfer component under TASAF III will have a substantial portion linked to changing the
behavior of parents in enrolling their children at the age of seven, and also help retain girls in
forms V-VI, where there have been many dropouts.
165. The CAS Results Framework presents the results chain for the Bank’s program
(annex 1). The framework begins from the MKUKUTA and the MKUZA and selects outcomes
to those that the Bank can demonstrably influence over the CAS period, including the lagged
effects of operations started under the 2007 CAS. CAS outcomes are monitored jointly by the
Bank and the government. Also, the Bank will use the Country Program Results Monitoring Tool
to monitor portfolio impact and progress toward CAS outcomes. Since most of the new
operations foreseen in this CAS will likely not finish implementation until after 2015, results
during this CAS period will come mainly from existing operations.
166. The Tanzanian statistical system will be strengthened to improve availability of
relevant and reliable data. For many indicators, the CAS will rely on the Tanzanian statistical
system for baseline and target values. The national statistical system of Tanzania has been
suffering from several constraints in the past. To address this, the World Bank and other
development partners assist the government in the development of the Tanzania Statistical
Master Plan (TSMP). The estimated cost of the TSMP is US$64.6 million, of which, the Bank
will finance US$30 million through the STATCAP credit (FY11) with an expected
implementation period of 2011-16.
44

167. The country team monitors the portfolio in real time, eliminating the need for
frequent CPPRs, which the government discourages due to the transaction costs they impose.
The Country Management Unit will continue to issue focused quarterly portfolio reports, which
highlight portfolio issues and actions to be taken.
168. Trust funds are fully integrated in the CAS and will be managed accordingly. The
Bank has already taken measures to integrate trust fund programs and budgets with Bank-funded
programs and to ensure that trust funds are aligned with the CAS. Analytical work and policy
notes funded by trust funds undergo the same rigorous review as Bank budget-funded analytical
work; and trust fund financed activities are implemented in accordance with the same fiduciary
requirements as IDA financed operations.
169. Continued improvement of donor harmonization for aid effectiveness has been part
of development partners’ strategy in Tanzania over the past two decades. The government
and DPs signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2006, which established the current
dialogue structure. The Bank is an active player in the Development Partner Group and many of
the 26 sector or thematic working groups. The Bank is also a permanent member of the GBS
coordination group (Troika+), which provides a forum for government and development partner
to assess progress and coordinate interventions. Most major sectors and reform programs
undertake joint annual reviews preceding the GBS annual review, and formally adopt or are
striving toward sectorwide approaches. The Development Partner Group undertakes periodic
division of labor exercises to encourage selectivity and increase effectiveness (see annex 11).
170. During the CAS period, the Bank will continue to coordinate with development
partners and participate in development dialogue throughout Tanzania. The Bank will
continue to encourage SWAPs and joint supervision missions where relevant. Currently nine
IDA financed projects channel funds through ten basket funding mechanisms to support common
programs jointly with other DPs. Bank supported projects use country systems to the greatest
extent possible and avoid project implementation units. Harmonization is further increased
through greater transparency of information shared on the Bank’s website for Tanzania. This
includes translation and sharing of Bank project information documents to Kiswahili.
171. The CAS follows the Africa Region’s Strategy by using partnerships as a means to
achieve development outcomes, building on the core partnership with the government. The
Bank, as a key development partner in Tanzania, will continue to increase aid effectiveness
through partnerships with the domestic and international private sector, civil society, the
Tanzanian diaspora, and development agencies, including non-traditional donors. The ongoing
cooperation with the China Development Bank, the International Poverty Reduction Center of
China, the increased collaboration with CSOs to strengthen demand side governance, and
deepened dialogue with the private sector (especially in the area of PPPs), and innovative
operations in energy, finance, and water – are examples of the renewed focus on partnerships.
172. The Bank will prepare a CAS Progress Report in 2013, or earlier if needed, to
evaluate progress toward CAS outcomes and adjust strategy and program.

45

V. RISKS AND MITIGATION
173. Weakening PFM performance. The declining Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) score reflects the gradual deterioration of the PFM systems since 2005.22
A major indicator of deteriorating performance is the adverse opinion given by the CAG on the
Consolidated Financial Statement of GoT for 2009/10 in his latest report of April 2011.
Weaknesses in budget planning and execution have led to lapses in commitment control, hence
reducing contract credibility and driving up prices charged by contractors. This in turn reduces
the impact of public investment spending. Weaknesses in managing procurement have further
exacerbated this problem. The Bank will continue to collaborate with the national authorities and
other partners to strengthen PFM through PEFAR, PRSC, and its lending and advisory support to
LGAs.
174. Prospects for hydrocarbon development. The strong possibility of offshore natural gas
reserves and the prospects of discovering additional petroleum resources may have a negative
impact on governance, fiscal discipline, and public investments. Expected decreased reliance on
development assistance may lead to a further deterioration of the reform environment. The
concerns will be addressed by continued policy dialogue, AAA, and through the proposed
Natural Gas Technical Assistance Project (FY12). To mitigate the risk of a further weakening
reform environment, the proposed CAS narrows the scope of PRSCs and will focus on areas with
strong government commitment.
175.
Weak implementation capacity at the local government level. Risks arise in Bank
financed operations implemented primarily at the local government level. The weak institutional
and governance framework is exacerbated by inadequate incentive and sanction regime. The
inadequate incentive structure remains a key impediment to service delivery at all levels. To
mitigate the risk the World Bank will scale up support to LGAs through LGSP II and TSCP and
sectoral projects.
176. Risk of increasing inequality. The poverty rate has not changed significantly since 2000
and growth has not been shared evenly. There is growing concern about increasing income
inequality and its negative implications for both economic growth and social peace. Less than
expected increase in employment opportunities and income, especially in the agriculture sector
and for youth, may lead to a further increase in absolute inequality.
177. Exogenous risks, such as weather and international food and fuel prices. Weather
conditions, such as droughts, have a strong influence on the output of the agricultural sector and
the availability of hydroelectricity.

22

The PEFA score declined between 2005 and 2009 mainly due to reduced ratings for the following indicators: PI 1
- variance in expenditure composition, PI 3 – revenue out turn compared to original approved budget, PI 4 – arrears,
PI 11 - orderliness and participation in the annual budget process, and PI 28 - Legislative scrutiny of external audit
reports.

ANNEX 9: WORLD BANK CLIENT SURVEY
1. Objective: The purpose of the client survey was to (i) assist the World Bank in gaining a
better understanding of how stakeholders in Tanzania perceive the Bank and (ii) obtain data to
help inform the Tanzania country team’s strategy. Stakeholders were asked to provide (i) their
views regarding the general environment in Tanzania; (ii) overall impressions of the World Bank
as related to programs, poverty reduction, personal relationships, effectiveness, knowledge base,
collaboration, and its day-to-day operation; and (iii) perceptions of the World Bank’s
communication and outreach in Tanzania.
2. Methodology: From October through December 2010, 813 stakeholders of the World Bank
in Tanzania were invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by
participating in a country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of
the president, prime minister, ministers, or parliamentarians, permanent secretaries or deputy
permanent secretaries, employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or implementation
agency; regional administration offices, local government officials or staff, bilateral or
multilateral aid agencies, private sector or business organizations, NGOs (including CBOs), the
media, independent government institutions, trade unions, religious organizations, academia or
research institutes, and the judiciary. A total of 348 stakeholders participated in the country
survey (43 percent). The largest number of respondents were from NGOs (19 percent), followed
by ministry/regional administration (15 percent), and private sector (13 percent).
3. Results: The survey suggests that the World Bank is believed to play a critical and relevant
role in Tanzania, and that its work is aligned with the priorities of stakeholders in the country.
The slightly less positive views of the Bank revolve around its results. While respondents
suggest that the Bank does relatively well in some key areas such as education and agriculture,
the ratings are somewhat low for many key priority areas such as poverty reduction, governance
and corruption, and growth (all with ratings at or below 6.3 on a 10 point scale).
4. Areas of focus: In contrast to most countries, stakeholders in Tanzania do not identify just
one or two top development priorities when considering growth and poverty reduction. Rather
they view a range of areas as critical. Within this context respondents report that the Bank would
be most productive if it focused on areas (considered important) related to basic infrastructure,
improving government effectiveness, education and to a less degree, agriculture development
(followed by employment and corruption). There is strong alignment between which
development areas stakeholders believe the Bank should emphasize, and what they believe the
Bank, in fact, considers its top priorities (government effectiveness and basic infrastructure).
5. Value to the clients: Stakeholders report positive views about the Bank’s general budget
support but see a bit more value in its investment lending. Stakeholders identify ‘imposing
conditions’ (53 percent) and taking a boilerplate approach to country challenges (47 percent) as
the Bank’s greatest weaknesses in Tanzania. Another weakness emerged which is rarely seen in
other country surveys. Nearly four out of ten stakeholders reported that the Bank is too
influenced by ‘rich donor countries’ in Tanzania.

ANNEX 10: CAS CONSULTATIONS
1. The World Bank carried out consultations with stakeholders in Zanzibar, Mwanza, and
Mbeya in December, 2010, and in Dar-es-Salaam in late 2010 and January-February, 2011. The
stakeholders emphasized a role for the Bank in addressing the following challenges: governance
and anti-corruption, access to basic services, capacity building, income-generating opportunities,
business environment, infrastructure limitations, particularly in rural roads, rail and electricity,
and value-addition in agriculture.
2. Ministers identified key priority areas for development including agricultural productivity,
population growth, value addition, land administration, climate change and natural resource
management. The Planning Commission is preparing the first five-year development plan whose
objectives are in line with the proposed CAS. The Prime Minister noted that the World Bank is
too thinly spread and interventions should focus on agriculture and infrastructure (energy, ports,
roads, airports). The Prime Minister concurred with development partners’ assessment of GBS
performance as disappointing, and requested World Bank’s assistance in addressing the
challenge of stagnant poverty rates in the context of high growth.
3. Regional government representatives requested expanded assistance over the next CAS
period, particularly in social sectors. Key issues raised include job creation, particularly in light
of youth unemployment, investment climate reforms, social protection and safety net programs,
and human resources for health and education, including absenteeism. Participants noted that
delivery of basic social services suffers from weak coordination between the national
government and LGAs, as well as from low downward accountability. Government officials
urged the World Bank to improve bureaucratic procedures, increase efficiency in disbursements,
and deepen the involvement of councils and municipalities in project preparation activities and
project management, which would increase ownership, equitability, and local capacity. Zanzibar
government representatives emphasized the need to improve dialog between the Revolutionary
Government of Zanzibar (RGoZ) and Development Partners, as well as the need for better
integration of MKUZA II in the CAS.
4. Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) highlighted the following key areas where the World
Bank could focus its support: health systems strengthening, infrastructure bottlenecks,
employment and vocational training, participation of youth and vulnerable or marginalized
groups, people with disabilities, early childhood development, and a more radical approach to
governance. CSOs requested World Bank assistance in improving their capacity to monitor
public sector performance, as well as to plan and implement projects. Representatives welcomed
the proposal to create a civil society mechanism for third-party monitoring of CAS
implementation.
5. Private sector representatives pointed to the inadequate levels of education and skills as
major challenges to the private sector growth, and a necessary precondition for competitiveness.
Improvements in power supply, telecom, and transport infrastructure, particularly the railways
and ports, are central to future growth in the sector. Representatives urged the World Bank to
facilitate a simplification of the tax system and the regulatory framework, as well as
improvements in the setup and performance of regulatory authorities. The World Bank was
68

asked to increase emphasis on governance to prevent conflict of interest and political
interference. To improve the investment climate, the stalled reforms must be restarted
6. The Governor of the Bank of Tanzania noted the following three areas as crucial for
poverty-reducing growth: agriculture, SME, and the private sector. In agriculture, SAGCOT
should be seen as a pilot on partnerships between smallholders, agro-business and processors.
Agriculture should be supported by a “cluster of services” including infrastructure, export
processing zones, irrigation, and skills. SME development could be improved by extension
services and access to finance and could address increasing youth unemployment in urban areas.
In the private sector, the World Bank has a role in leveraging investments, and PPPs could be an
instrument for growth. Infrastructure investment could facilitate trade and strengthen the
manufacturing sector. The governor noted that the Bank’s AAA could support the planning
commission in deepening the understanding of key issues.
7. Regional integration ministry officials emphasized the importance of private sector led
growth and noted the importance of the 2010 PPP Act in improving the enabling environment.
Critical measures to promote private sector growth include: lowering the cost of doing business
and trade; improving transport links, especially with landlocked EAC countries; reducing NTBs
and improving law enforcement and regulations addressing NTBs. The ministry faces significant
communication challenges both within the EAC, and between Tanzania and the EAC, with
regard to the alignment of sectoral plans and priorities.
8. Judiciary officials noted the limited capacity to prosecute grand corruption; an increase in
funds for materials and staff is essential for dealing with the current case load. The officials
noted that World Bank support for the judicial system should be given straight to the Judiciary
and not the Executive (Ministry of Justice), which undermines the judiciary as a separate branch
and is ineffective in bringing about improvement, as it mixes judicial with legal reform.
Participants requested more Bank support for the judiciary’s land division in order to accelerate
land reform during the next CAS.

ANNEX 12: REGIONAL INTEGRATION
A. Current Status of Regional Integration
1. Over the last decade, the pace of regional integration in Africa has increased, as
evidenced by the fastened institutional development and on-going initiatives to harmonize trade
policies within regional economic communities (RECs). The EAC, established in 2000, is the
most recent and arguably most advanced. The custom union (CU) came into effect in 2005 and
the common market protocol was signed in 2009. A monetary union is planned for 2012, and
later political federation (2016). The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) launched its custom union (CU) in June 2009. The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) FTA was launched in August 2008, and their Regional Indicative Strategic
Development Plan (RISDP) envisioned a CU by 2010, a common market by 2015, and a
monetary union by 2016 with single currency to be introduced by 2018.
2. One of the key challenges in RECs is overlapping memberships. Three EAC members are
in COMESA, and only Tanzania is in SADC. Further five SADC members are also in the
Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) which is open for three others. However, establishment
of a tripartite free trade area (TFTA), that was decided at the 2008 tripartite summit, will be a
historic step (combining three RECs: COMESA, SADC, and EAC). The TFTA plan does not
envisage replacing the existing RECs, but its main objective is to help avoid problems of
overlapping memberships and harmonize trade policies. It is also supposed to facilitate
cooperation in infrastructure projects.
3. Member states now focus on harmonization of their macro and sector policies, and the
enabling legal and regulatory regimes. Activities focus on harmonizing trade policies in
COMESA and EAC with respect to CETs, RoO regimes, approaches to elimination of NTBs (at
the TFTA).
4. The accelerated progress in East African integration offers new opportunities and
challenges for Tanzania. The EAC development policy blue print is contained in the EAC Five
Year Development Strategy. The current strategy ended in 2010, and the EAC secretariat is in
the process of formulating a new strategy (2011 – 2015).23
5. Despite significant progress, much remains to be done as there are major delays at
borders, revenue sharing agreements have yet to be formulated, and customs and red tape remain
burdensome. However, the challenges of implementing Common Market Protocol (CMP)
notwithstanding, EAC stands a greater chance of demonstrating the beneficial role of regional
integration by addressing both soft and hard issues underlying development in Tanzania.
23

The key priorities in the present strategy are grouped under five pillars: (i) cooperation in political matters, defense, and
security; (ii) completion of the implementation of the Customs Union Protocol; (iii) establishment of the East African Common
Market; (iv) laying the foundation for the East African Monetary Union; and (v) laying the foundation for an East African
political federation.

71

B. Policy and Institutional Context
6. As in most other EAC member states, the institution responsible for regional
integration is the Ministry of EAC (MEAC). The vision, mission, and strategic objectives of
the ministry is stated in the MEAC’s Medium Term Strategic Plan 2010/11 – 2012/2013
(MEAC, October 2010). The overall objective of the strategic plan is to enable Tanzania to
achieve increased economic and social benefits from the EAC. The strategic goals of MEAC, as
outlined in the MEAC strategic plan, include to:








Coordinate and facilitate participation of public, private, and civil societies
Public awareness on EAC regional integration
Harmonization of EAC policies and programs
Promote EAC-SADC-COMESA policies for free trade area
Monitor and promote EAC project and programs implemented in the country
Strengthen monitoring and evaluation of EAC Treaty and its protocols
Facilitate capacity building.

7. The renewed emphasis on regional integration for Tanzania emanates from the
increasing recognition of Tanzania improved trade performance in the regional markets.

8. Transit trade is increasingly been viewed as a great opportunities for Tanzania given its
geographic location. However, these priorities are only broadly reflected in the policy
frameworks. In MKUKUTA II, regional integration is covered under cluster 1 (growth and
reduction of income poverty), in relation to its aim of increasing competitiveness to achieve
higher export growth for poverty reduction.
9. Reflecting increased emphasis on regional integration, the Planning Commission has
commissioned a study on “harnessing the benefits of regional integration” in order to inform
medium to longer term policy interventions. With support from Trade Mark EA, the Ministry of
EAC is also preparing its Common Market Implementation Strategy (2011-2015). The strategy
discusses potential costs and benefits from the EAC integration. It also describes the institutional
framework, instruments, and strategic interventions for implementing the CMP.
72

10. In its current endeavors, the MEAC has placed emphasis on the need to lower cost of
doing business at regional level and enhancing capacity of the Tanzanian private sector to
take full advantage of the integration. Some of the initiatives being prioritized include (i) an EAC
wide PPP; (ii) SPS protocol to promote standards in agricultural products; (iii) trade related
infrastructure, for instance, to support one border post initiatives, railway, and road connections
to promote transit trade; and (iv) awareness raising.
C. World Bank and Other Donors’ support on Regional Integration
11. The regional integration agenda is central for Sub-Sahara Africa as stressed in the
World Bank strategy for Africa, given the scope for cooperation to help overcome market
inefficiencies and also improve competitiveness. Regional integration is one of the four major
themes in the new WBG trade strategy. One of the strategic interventions proposed by the
strategy is improving trade corridors and regional trade facilitation frameworks. This is a
critically important issue for transit trade. While in many cases formal regional and bilateral
agreements are already in place, implementation is often jeopardized by poor cross-country
cooperation. The trade strategy will be implemented through region-specific work programs and
activities by central units.
12. The World Bank will continue to support the regional integration agenda. Ongoing and
future interventions on regional integration in Tanzania include ESW, TA, and lending.
Examples of on-going or past work include work on services trade, growth potential of
agglomeration, the Trade and Transport Facilitation Project, financial integration, and incountry transport corridors. There is also increased recognition of the role of the private sector as
both financier and operator of regional projects.
13. In going forward, the Africa regional strategy identified strategic actions for the Bank to:








Be more selective and invest in a smaller number of projects in terms of potential
outcomes and impacts within each sub-region;
Scale up partner collaboration to mobilize resources and reduce transaction costs for
regional investments;
Work more closely with the private sector in helping to deliver PPP solutions;
Mainstream regional integration in CASs and work programs, with a focus on
addressing policy and institutional barriers that impede economic integration, and
ensuring stronger alignment between national policies and regional trade and economic
agreements;
Expand support for capacity building of regional institutions, and strengthening civic
engagement and social accountability in the regional integration process;
Strengthen knowledge platforms on regional economic issues and collaboration with
regional institutions in delivering such work.

73

Regional approaches as game changers
African countries are increasingly recognizing that collaborative actions and regional approaches are critical to
stimulating trade by connecting markets; and developing cost effective economic infrastructure that would not only
spur faster growth but also the competitiveness required to participate in the global economy. They are particularly
important to overcome the physical disadvantages for 15 land-locked countries whose trade performance relies on
collaboration with coastal countries; managing shared natural resources (water, fisheries); and resolving such
challenges infection diseases which recognize no boundaries and in tertiary education and research where economies
of scale can be achieved in developing regional centers of excellence.
Since 2007, the World Bank has scaled-up its support to regional integration, doubling its commitments from
US$1.8 billion to the current US$3.6 billion. Key sectors include transport, power, trans-boundary water
infrastructure, and ICT accounting for 78 percent of these commitments. This distribution clearly reflects the Bank‘s
focus on supporting the continent in bridging the infrastructure deficit – crucial for growth, competitiveness and
employment and vital for poverty reduction.
The results of this support are already showing. In Kenya and Malawi, the price of broadband capacity has dropped
by over 80 percent in part, due to their connected to international, undersea broadband cables. These are two of 7
Eastern and Southern African countries benefiting from Bank support. Also the construction and rehabilitation of
840 km of roads along critical commercial transport corridors in West, Central Africa and East Africa is expected to
reduce the transit time by 20 percent at Mombasa-Kigali, Tema-Ougadougou-Bamako, Douala-Nd‘jamena, and
Douala-Bangui corridors; significantly cutting down on ―beyond the factory cost of doing business.
In agriculture, common regulations for the registration of genetic materials and pesticides have been adopted by the
Economic Community of West African States. This is incentivizing the development of agricultural technologies
tailored to the specific climatic and geographic needs of West Africa by enlarging the target market and easing
dissemination across borders. Furthermore, five productivity enhancing agricultural technologies have been
developed at new regional centers of excellence and disseminated across West Africa, the result of which is a new
technology that allows for the addition of 15 percent local cereal flour in bread production has resulted in a 30
percent reduction in the price of bread.

Summary
i.

This CAS Completion Report for Tanzania (CASCR) reviews and rates performance under the
FY2007-2011 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was prepared as part of the multidonor
Joint Assistance Strategy for the United Republic of Tanzania (JAST). The JAST and CAS were
aligned to support Tanzania’s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategies, known by the Kiswahili
acronyms MKUKUTA (mainland) and MKUZA (Zanzibar). In April 2010, the Bank produced a
CAS Progress Report with an updated and streamlined Results Matrix focusing on 12 outcomes
and 22 outcome indicators.

ii.

The CASCR rates overall program and Bank performance under the JAST as moderately
satisfactory. Of the 12 CAS outcomes, three were achieved, eight were partially achieved, and
one was not achieved, as shown in the summary table below.

iii.

During the CAS period, investment lending and development policy lending within a general
budget support (GBS) framework have contributed to a number of important outcomes, and
lending instruments have complemented and reinforced each other. Achievements include: an
improved road network, improved livelihoods for the urban poor, and better health indicators for
infant and under-five mortality. A substantive dialogue between Government and GBS partners,
led by the World Bank, was an important contributor to these outcomes.

iv.

However, despite the rich dialogue, the overall reform environment appears to have slowed
during the CAS period and many reforms needed for sustainable, long-term development are
stalled. In some areas, progress has even reversed course. Areas where progress is disappointing
include: rural poverty reduction, the business environment; management of strategic
infrastructure, such as utilities, ports, and railroads; quality of basic education; and public
financial management.

v.

Achievement of the outcomes in the CAS Results Matrix reflects these two trends. Many CAS
outcomes have been achieved. However, Tanzania’s progress has been mixed in implementing
reforms needed to achieve country-level goals.

The weakening reform environment possibly reflects less commitment to undertake difficult
reforms or possibly reflects the difficulty of implementing second and third generation reforms.
The Bank responded to the slowdown by shifting some IDA resources from development policy
lending to investment lending, especially infrastructure.

Introduction

1. The CAS Completion Report (CASCR)24 assesses program and Bank performance under the FY20072011 CAS for the United Republic of Tanzania (Report No. 38625-TZ; March 1, 2007), henceforth referred
to as the CAS, and the CAS Progress Report (Report No. 52922-TZ; March 2, 2010), henceforth referred to
as CASPR.
2. The JAST aligned 22 development partners25 (DPs) with Tanzania's Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategies, (MKUKUTA for Mainland and MKUZA for Zanzibar). The JAST was a national medium-term
framework for managing development cooperation between the Government of the United Republic of
Tanzania (Government) and DPs to achieve national development and poverty reduction goals.
3. The CAS was formulated under the JAST framework and consisted of four parts: (i) the national
medium-term framework established by Government for managing development cooperation and DPs
commitment to the aid effectiveness agenda; (ii) joint country analysis describing Tanzania’s development
achievements and challenges; (iii) a joint program document, reflecting the Development Partner Group’s
planned support; and (iv) the World Bank’s strategic approach and proposed program for FY07 to FY10,
including a Bank-specific Results Matrix with milestones to facilitate monitoring.
4. As was typical for first-generation results-based CASes, the original CAS Results Matrix was long and
unrealistic, with 32 CAS outcomes and 52 indicators and incomplete baseline and target data. Under the
CASPR, the Results Matrix was updated and streamlined, reducing the number of outcomes to 12 and the
number of outcome indicators to 22. The CASPR also extended the CAS by one year, to end June 2011, to
accommodate delays in the development of Tanzania’s Second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy
(MKUKUTA II). The extension also allowed the CAS to be finalized with Tanzania’s new government after
the October 2010 elections.
5. The remainder of this report is organized as follows. Section II outlines Tanzania’s strategic goals to
which the CAS is aligned. Included in this discussion is an assessment of Tanzania’s higher development
achievements contributed to by the PRSC series through GBS. Section III reports on progress towards CAS
outcomes listed in the Results Matrix. Section IV assesses performance of the Bank portfolio over the CAS
period. Section V outlines lessons learned and suggestions for the next CAS.

II.

Tanzania’s Strategic Goals

6. MKUKUTA was formulated in a broad-based consultative manner with civil society and other nongovernment stakeholders, including international partners. Government and DPs have measured progress
against MKUKUTA targets since 2007 through a MKUKUTA Annual Implementation Report (MAIR), as
24

The Tanzania CASCR mainly follows the previous CACSR guidelines, because the CASCR was initiated before
OPCS issued new CASCR guidelines dated January 2011. Sources for the Completion Report are ISRs, ICRs, mid-term
reviews, aide memoires, GBS annual reviews, MKUKUTA Annual Implementation Reports, sector reviews, and IEG
ICR and sector evaluations.

well as through the Annual Reviews of General Budget Support. MKUKUTA, based on the National Vision
2025, envisages a reduction of poverty by 50 percent by 2010 and eradication of absolute poverty by 2025.
The goals would be achieved through advancement in three clusters: (I) economic growth and reduction of
income poverty; (II) improvement of quality of life and social well being; and (III) governance and
accountability. Those sectors with prominence in the ruling party’s program received most Government
involvement and support, suggesting that understanding priority areas within the larger parties better could
ensure a higher degree of positive development results in the next CAS.
7. Progress across the three clusters of the MKUKUTA has been uneven because the pace of policy reform
has been inconsistent. Poverty has not fallen as much as expected. Analyses based on the 2007 Household
Budget Survey (HBS) suggest that poverty fell marginally by about 2.3 percentage points, from 35.6 percent
of the population in 2001 to 33.3 percent in 2007. Between 2007 and 2009, the estimated poverty headcount,
using the latest National Panel Survey (2009) data, suggests a very small increase in the proportion of
Tanzanians living below the basic needs and food poverty lines with increases from 33.6 percent to 34.0
percent, and 16.6 percent to 17.4 percent respectively. Based on the latest data, Tanzania is not on track for
meeting these two MDG targets.
8. The small relative reduction in the poverty rate from 2001 may at least partly be linked to Tanzania’s
very rapid population growth rate of about 2.9 percentage points per year. Due to rapid population growth,
even if the relative proportion of poor has fallen slightly, the absolute number of poor has risen by
approximately one million between 2001 and 2009.
Box 1: Poverty Reduction in Tanzania 2000-2010
Between 2007 and 2009, the estimated poverty headcount using the latest National Panel Survey (2009) data
suggests a slight increase, albeit not significant, in the proportion of Tanzanians living below the basic needs and
food poverty lines with increases from 33.6 percent to 34.0 percent , and 16.6 percent to 17.4 percent , respectively.
Tanzania is therefore not on track for meeting the basic needs and food security MDG. Though Tanzania is
undeniably off track to achieving the poverty MDG, the distribution of consumption suggests that achieving the
MDG remains feasible, because a relatively large concentration around the poverty line.
Contrary to the situation for the poverty MDG described above, Tanzania is on track to reach the MDG for
nutrition. The 2010 DHS measured that 15.8 percent of children are underweight down from 28.9 percent in 2000
and 21.6 percent in 2004/05.

9. The Bank underscored the importance of sustainable economic growth in the second Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) series and in the 2007 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) for Tanzania. The
CEM emphasized the need to replace certain drivers of growth, such as Government spending and expansion
of cultivated land, with others such as increased productivity, savings, and investment by the private sector,
in order to ensure continued economic growth. While poverty did not decrease as expected, Tanzania’s
economy grew by an estimated rate of between 5 and 7 percent per annum from 2000 to 2008. Under normal
circumstances, the economic growth would have had a much greater impact on poverty reduction. However,
economic growth over the CAS period was spurred by significant increases in public spending and foreign
aid in addition to population growth. The 2007 CEM identified three quarters of economic growth coming
from Government spending and foreign aid. Therefore, the annual growth of the economy, adjusted for
Government stimulus, comes to just above four percentage points – about the same rate of economic growth
as the period 1990-99. With an estimated population growth of nearly three percentage points, nonGovernment induced real growth per capita is just above one percentage point.

10. Under Cluster I – Growth and Reduction of Income Poverty – achievements, many linked to Bank
interventions, include macroeconomic stability, a broadened tax base, improved roads, and a six percentage
point increase in the population with access to electricity. But these improvements are eclipsed by lack of
progress elsewhere: the business environment; infrastructure management, including railway, seaports, and
power generation and distribution; and water supply and sanitation (WSS).
11. Substantial progress has been made under Cluster II – Improvement of Quality of Life and Social
Wellbeing – in relation to basic education enrollment and lower rates of infant and under-five mortality.
However, increased enrollment has not been matched by improvements in the quality of education. In WSS,
gains have been made in areas covered by Bank financed projects, providing more people with access to
improved WSS. However, overall WSS in Tanzania faces serious challenges: the Dar es Salaam WSS utility
continues a multiple decade struggle for financial sustainability and reaching satisfactory levels in quality of
services. The Water Sector Development Program for mainland Tanzania shows signs of fiduciary problems
such as inconsistent disbursement data, missing documentation for fund management, and unsatisfactory
financial management arrangements.
12. Under Cluster III – Governance and Accountability – gains have been made in providing basic
services through safety nets to the vulnerable in areas covered by IDA-financed community-driven
development programs, notably the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF). However, progress has been
marginal or even reversed for four of five core Government reforms: Public Financial Management Reform
Program (PFMRP), Public Service Reform Program (PSRP), National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACSAP),
and Legal Sector Reform Program (LSRP). For example, the draft Procurement Bill (September 2010),
among other issues, allows for procurement of heavy plant equipment under emergency procedures. The
amended Public Service Act limits competitive recruitment to entry level positions in the public service up to
senior professionals, effectively making all managerial positions in the public service noncompetitive
appointments. On the positive side, Government has shown commitment to fulfilling the agreed funding
level for the Local Government Development Grants (LGDG): in the FY10/11 budget, Government
contributions for the first time exceed DP contributions.

Achievements in Policy Reforms Supported by the Second PRSC Series26
13. The second PRSC series (PRSC 4-8) yielded a number of major policy reforms, such as the abolishment
of levies by Crop Boards, the limitation of Crop Board functions to regulatory functions, the timely issue of
budget audit reports, the submission of an electricity tariff application, an improved Road Bill, enhanced
autonomy of the Road Agency, substantially increased budget for road maintenance, enactment of a new
Anticorruption Bill, new Audit Bill aligned with AfroSAI27-3 requirements, new internal audit department
for the entire Government, approval of a new Private Public Partnership (PPP) Bill, key measures to reduce
congestion at the port, and enhanced powers and autonomy of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority
(PPRA).
14. Policy has failed to advance, or has reversed, in some areas. Bank-supported Public Expenditure
Reviews (PERs) have shown that alignment of the budget with the MKUKUTA has weakened. Other areas
of stalled or reversed policy include: agricultural marketing, notably phasing out the local crop levies; civil
service pay reform; and the enactment of the Business Activities Registration Act (BARA), which goes
against the one-stop-shop principle.
15. The increasing number of unmet triggers from PRSC 4 to PRSC 8 reflects Tanzania’s slowing reform
environment (see Figure 2). Under PRSC 4 all triggers were met. For PRSC-7 and PRSC-8, only seven
triggers of the initial eleven were met. The share of triggers not met or partially met increased progressively
to nearly 40 percent of triggers for PRSC 8. The Bank responded to the slowdown by adjusting and
sequencing triggers in some areas from one operation to the next, thus helping to bring about crop board
reforms and the new PPP law.
16. The unmet triggers resulted in lower amounts of GBS. PRSC operations were adjusted downward when
triggers were not met. In addition, and most importantly, the Bank responded to Tanzania’s slowdown in
reforms by reducing budget support as a percentage of IDA lending. Under the 2007 CAS, annual budget
support was expected to increase from US$190 million in FY08 to US$400 million in FY10. Actual budget
support disbursements from the World Bank in FY10 were less than 30 percent of the planned amount
(US$115 million).
17. Several factors may have contributed to the slowdown in policy reforms, such as reform fatigue, failure
to agree on the consequences of lack of progress between Government and the Bank, and a perception of
entitlement to GBS on the part of Government. The question of whether to continue to provide budget
support has been intensely debated by the Country Team. If the current reform environment continues,
budget support disbursements under IDA 16 are likely to drop further, allowing a further shift of IDA funds
into investment operations.

Progress against CAS Outcomes

This section assesses progress against the outcomes and indicators outlined in the CAS Results Matrix of the
CASPR (see Annex 1).
18. Progress against CAS outcomes has been mixed. Some areas have seen remarkable progress (e.g. net
education enrollment, improved basic health indicators, and improvement of the road network) while other
areas (e.g. railway transport and infrastructure, electricity generation and supply, WSS, agricultural
production and efficiency) have stagnated or shown little progress.
19. The Bank began adjusting its portfolio's project designs to the slower speed of reform once results from
HBS 2007 were available (late 2008). For instance, the amount of GBS was reduced substantially in PRSC 7
and PRSC 8, and funding moved to projects in energy, agriculture and food security, and urban development
where fungibility is less and targeting of the poorest easier.
20. In the context of Government's willingness to reform, the Bank's impact could be further strengthened
by better sequencing and a stronger focus of the development dialogue on core areas, notably in Cluster I.
Once core areas show satisfactory progress, this could provide the basis for further assistance targeting
secondary areas.
21. In order to focus aid on areas that enjoy stronger Government support and can provide the basis for
growth, it is vital to understand the reform agenda. The Bank has carried out a series of routine analysis (e.g.
PEFAR, rapid budget analyses, and rapid poverty analyses) and has prepared comprehensive analytical notes
on Tanzania's political economy. These notes have provided Government, DPs, and Bank staff with practical
suggestions of ways to address issues across sectors, as well as within agriculture, transport, PFM, and
infrastructure. From a learning perspective, it is important that these activities are carried forward under the
next CAS, particularly since insights into Tanzania's political economy have yet to be fully translated into the
design of new projects.
22. The CAS supports MKUKUTA through cluster specific and cross-cluster approaches. For cross-cluster
support, the Bank -financed programs include, among others, the PRSC series, Local Government Support
Program (LGSP), and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA). Cluster specific support includes the
Central Transport Corridor Project (CTCP), Songo Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project
(SSGDPGP), Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP), the Private Sector Competitiveness Project
(PSCP).

84

23. All clusters included successful operations, particularly health, social protection, energy, transport, local
government, WSS and urban development. A common theme for successful projects is strong Government
support at central and local levels.
24. There were less successful operations including privatization, the Tanzania Railways Limited (TRL)
concession, natural resource management, governance, WSS and the business environment. For three
projects (MACEMP, TMAP, and PPSDP) an overly ambitious design and lack of Government support had a
major role in their unsatisfactory completion ratings. For the two WSS projects, the rail component under
CTCP, and the core reform projects, lack of ownership and conflicting political economy interests were
blocked progress towards project outcomes.
25. The mix of lending AAA was generally adequate as Economic Sector Work (ESW), Technical
Assistance (TA), and policy notes provided timely and relevant information to the Bank’s lending program in
Tanzania. The AAA program covered among other nutrition, private sector development, trade, economic
growth, poverty dynamics, agriculture, and public expenditure analysis. However, it is unclear whether
findings under the AAA program always reached policy makers sufficiently as few policy recommendations
have been taken onboard in the government’s broader program, implying either that more work should go
into aligning the AAA program closer with government’s interest, or that interest in AAA from
government’s side has leveled off similar to government’s interest in pursuing broader reform.
26. The partnership agenda under the CAS resulted in an elaborate and intricate dialogue structure with a
complex system of working groups (WG), such as cluster WGs, technical WGs, fora for Heads of Missions
(HoM), Heads of Cooperation (HoC), and a dedicated forum for the GBS dialogue headed by a troika plus
the World Bank as a permanent member. In accordance with the Paris Declaration, DPs have pledged a
reduction in the number and frequency of missions, and to respect Government’s “quiet time” from April to
August where there should be few missions at all.
27. The new dialogue structure has reduced partner meetings with Government, which should increase the
latter’s efficiency by reducing external demands on its. However, coordination of DPs’ support to Tanzania
is imperfect. The OECD DAC recorded Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) to Tanzania from 43
entities between 2003 and 2007. Four of the 43 entities provided more than half of ODA and 13 entities
provided more than 90 percent of ODA. This leaves Tanzania’s Government with 30 entities providing less
10 percent of foreign assistance to Tanzania, creating high overheads for the donors and increased
transactions costs for the Government. The Bank has started a discussion about the number of DPs, but this
initiative has not reduced the dispersion of partners supporting Tanzania.

28. The revised Results Matrix reflects the changes in the lending program and the progress in
implementation, with special attention to attribution to the Bank's interventions. CAS outcomes in the same
or related sectors have been consolidated, while some outcomes that were too high or low were either
removed or included as milestones. Overambitious targets have been modified to more realistic levels. All
indicators have been selected from existing government sources or projects. Annex 1 presents a streamlined
matrix with 12 CAS outcomes and 22 associated indicators. The revised outcomes are described in Annex 2.
Four outcomes were dropped. The first pertains to improved railway network capacity where it was
envisaged transport on the Central Railway Line would increase from 1.45m tons to 2.0 million tons by
2010. However disputes around the concession to Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) led Government to
revoke the contract with RITES in February 2010 (see box below). Annex 2 compares the original and
revised outcomes, and explains key revisions.

Box 2: The Concession of the Tanzania Railways Limited
In May 2001, Government of Tanzania decided to involve private sector participation in the operation of the
Central Railway Line through the creation of Tanzania Railway Cooperation (TRC), a vertically integrated
concession, without open access and with exclusive rights to a 25 year concession to operate railway transport
services on the Central Line railway network. By the end of 2005 TRC was caught in a vicious circle of low
performance, lack of funding for necessary investments, and no interested private partner. Operational
efficiency was constrained by poor infrastructure and rolling stock. From 2001 to 2006 freight figures for TRC
dropped from 1.35 million tons to 0.775 million tons. It was clear that the negative trend could only be reversed
through heavy investment in rail infrastructure and operating equipment.
To address the challenges TRC was restructured through a transfer of infrastructure assets and rolling stock to
the newly created RAHCO. In January 2006 the cabinet approved negotiations with the only bidder for the
Central Line, Rail India Technical and Economic Services Limited (RITES). Negotiations were concluded in
March 2006. TRC was handed over to Tanzania Rail Limited (TRL), jointly owned by Rites Railways of India
(51 percent) and GoT (49 percent), on October 10, 2007.
A World Bank mission found in 2009 that the performance of TRL was unsatisfactory. Only 450,000 tons of
freight was transported against a target of 650,000 tons. At the same time TRL faced an operating deficit
estimated at US$80 million for the following three years. A combination of heavy rains leading to serious
damages to the Central Line, workers’ strikes, and disputes with the asset holder (RAHCO) regarding lease of
rolling stock led Government to revoke the contract with RITES in February 2010.

86

29. Two outcomes (Integrated Management of Lake Victoria Basin and Increased Export of Value Added
Mineral Production) were dropped due to a delay in Board approval and because of weak expected impact of
technical assistance on mineral exports. The fourth dropped outcome was on improved management of court
cases; it was dropped due to weak attribution.
30. Important exogenous factors affecting CAS outcomes include to a limited degree the effects of the
global financial crisis, climatic changes (drought, El Niño), corruption, and lack of Government ownership of
certain parts of the development process. In relation to the global crisis, Tanzania appears to have suffered
less direct impact than what was initially expected. Tanzania’s economic slowdown is now estimated to
result in a reduction of GDP growth from 7.4 percent (4.5 percent per capita) in 2008 to 6 percent (4.5
percent per capita) in 2009 - a significant reduction from 2008’s 7.4 percent, but close to the trend growth in
non-drought years of 6.8 percent. Direct external shocks are most clearly visible in tourism (about 0.6
percent of GDP down) and possibly manufacturing exports – but not enough to depress growth by 2.4
percentage points of GDP. Markets for Tanzania’s export crops and minerals were hit temporarily or not at
all by the global crisis, and there were terms of trade benefits, so Tanzania’s import bill came down as a
result of the crisis.

Cluster I: Growth and Reduction of Income Poverty
31. Progress under Cluster I has been made in certain areas of transport and energy while progress has been
slow and uneven in agricultural development, natural resource management, business environment,
budgeting, financial management systems, and governance of public enterprises. Cluster 1’s goal to reduce
the poverty headcount to 19 percent by 2010 has been missed. Achievement of the goal by 2015 will not be
possible unless continued growth has a stronger impact on poverty.
32. The Bank wrote several pieces of AAA for Cluster I. Activities include PEFAR 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010,
and April 2011 (forthcoming), poverty assessments (2009 and 2011), and a number of analytical policy
papers spanning all sectors, notably power, port, education, business environment, and poverty.
33. Exogenous factors affecting the Bank’s contribution to outcomes under Cluster I include the political
environment, corruption, predictability of power supply, and the failed infrastructure privatization attempts.
Government’s commitment to a legal framework addressing corruption is not clear, particularly given the
new draft Procurement Bill, which contains provisions that may increase the potential for corruption.
Corruption has affected the power sector over the past decade, caused delays in procurement of equipment,
raised the cost of electricity generation, and disrupted senior management of the sector. Governments’
commitment to privatize is also not clear given the high number of infrastructure entities (including TRL and
DAWASCO), which have reverted to Government stewardship.
34. Besides the unclear future of TANESCO management, steady power supply has been affected by slow
adjustments of tariffs to full cost recovery for power generation, leaving TANESCO with insufficient funds
for maintenance and operation, resulting in frequent brown- and black outs.
35. All in all, the unsuccessful PPP attempts (notably the attempt to bring in a private partner for Dar es
Salaam WSS and the failed concession of TRL) have damaged Tanzania’s image as a suitable investment
destination in East Africa.

CAS Outcome 1.1: Increased Revenue Collection Efficiency [Partially Achieved]
36. The World Bank has supported progress towards Outcome 1.1 through the Tax Modernization Project
(TMP) approved in June 2006 and the second PRSC series. The Tanzania Revenue Authorities (TRA) has
made substantial efforts to improve the efficiency of revenue collection, but even with an optimistic
projection, the achievable collection results will be 7 percent below the target for 2010. The tax/GDP ratio
dropped from 15.0 percent in FY 2008/2009 to 14.5 percent in FY 2009/2010. For FY 2010/2011, collection
targets were increased by around 28 percent despite policy changes that are expected to reduce the revenue
potential. The effects of the global economic crisis also affected Outcome 1.1.
37. For the following years’ revenue, projections have been reduced to 16.2 percent of GDP in FY 2011/12
and 17.4 percent of GDP for FY 2012/13. This still represents a 12 percent increase in the tax/GDP ratio in a
two-year period. The Bank has reiterated its concerns with regard to overly optimistic collection targets.
38. The nominal net increase in tax collection compared to the same period in the previous FY was not
sufficient to sustain the tax/GDP ratio, which is expected to decrease to 14.2 percent in FY 2009/2010
compared to 15.0 percent in FY2008/2009, and a target of 15.5 percent. Policy changes having an impact on
collection results need to be appropriately considered when preparing collection estimates, causing collection
to fall short of target. In particular, collection levels in the Large Taxpayers Department (LTD) remained
below expectation due to an underestimation of the effects of the economic downturn and a decreased
revenue collection from the Value Added Tax (VAT). This was due to the fact that the reduction of the VAT
rate was not compensated to the extent expected by increased taxpayer compliance and boosted consumption.
Following particularly disappointing collection results in the second quarter of the fiscal year, performance
of both LTD and Customs is stabilizing, although actual collection of VAT remains below projections.
39. For FY2009/10, income tax is the highest component of tax revenues (31 percent) followed by VAT (29
percent) and excise tax (21 percent). Personal income is taxed according to a progressive schedule with five
income brackets. Tax rates applied range from 15 to 30 percent of taxable income. The exemption threshold
level of income has been adjusted annually. Since VAT is paid mainly by urban classes, it is likely to be
progressive, similarly for personal income tax. Non-tax revenue is very low, and massive evasion is reported
in the natural resource sector. In recent budgets, the use of tax exemptions has increased in a way that
subsidizes private goods and investments – this is probably regressive. A policy brief by Uwazi (December
2010) shows a substantial increase in tax exemptions relative to GDP from 2005, although exemptions have
started to decline since to pre-2005 levels. Tanzania’s tax exemptions are between two and six times higher
than those of Kenya and Uganda.
40. While milestones for Outcome 1.1 were all achieved, the indicator for the outcome itself was not

achieved. At the same time, the Bank recognizes that targets may have been too optimistic for Outcome 1.1.
Nevertheless, challenges from tax evasion in the natural resource sector and through exemptions indicate that

88

more can be done to achieve better revenue collection efficiency; hence progress towards Outcome 1.1 is
partly achieved. Supervision of TMP has been satisfactory and triggers related to revenue collection under
PRSC were achieved. AAA for Outcome 1.1 has taken place through the annual PEFAR exercise and input
through PRSC and TMP.

CAS Outcome 1.2: Improved Doing Business Environment [Not Achieved]
41. Support to an improved doing business environment took place through the following operations:
Privatization and Private Sector Development Project (PPSDP) from December 1999 to June 2010; Private
Sector Competitiveness Project (PSCP) from December 2005 to June 2012; Financial Sector Support Project
(FSSP) from June 2006 to July 2011 (likely to be extended); and TMP (described above under CAS
Outcome 1.1).
42. The impact of Bank support to Outcome 1.2 has been mixed. The ICR for PPSDP rates supervision and
achievement of PDO for this project as unsatisfactory. The ongoing PSCP has had satisfactory supervision
and marginally satisfactory achievement of PDO. The project’s component related directly to the business
environment (BEST) was rated unsatisfactory in April 2010. The ongoing FSSP was rated moderately
satisfactory in December 2010, but implementation has been slow. Government is addressing delays by
making changes to project implementation arrangements, and the project will likely be extended.
43. Following the disappointing rankings in the 2009 Doing Business Indicators and Africa
Competitiveness Report, Government restructured and mainstreamed the BEST program to focus on
reviewing the status of the business regulatory framework as measured by Doing Business indicators. A
Regulatory Reform Task Force constituted by a select committee of Permanent Secretaries undertook a
detailed technical analysis of all processes and procedures involved in each of the Ease of Doing Business
Indicators and identified immediate, medium-term, and long-term interventions in terms of policy, legal, or
administrative changes required to improve the situation, resulting in a Roadmap. The Roadmap consists of
four pillars: (i) opening/closing a business; (ii) construction permits; (iii) trade across borders, and (iv) tax
administration. Under BRELA, some progress is being made. About 40 percent of the business names are
now available in the BRELA database for searching. With respect to taxes, TIN numbers are now available
online and double inspections (by TRA Ministry of Finance and Planning) have been removed for property
assessments. While these measures contribute to reducing cost and time incurred by businesses, much still
needs to be done, particularly by setting specific targets and dates for the Roadmap. The Roadmap is at the
nascent stages of implementation; meanwhile, Tanzania has slipped three more places from 125 to 128 in the
2011 Doing Business Indicators.
44. Though many issues were well known and could have been resolved with minimal or no additional
funds, the Roadmap took more than eight months to prepare, and once completed the proposed changes are
superficial and do not address core issues facing Tanzanian entrepreneurs. The Roadmap is at the nascent
stages of implementation; meanwhile, Tanzania has slipped three more places from 125 to 128 in the 2011
Doing Business Indicators.

45. Under PSCP, a Comprehensive Action Plan for implementation of medium- and long-term interventions
in all pillars of the Roadmap is in preparation. The Roadmap consists of four pillars: (i) opening/closing a
business; (ii) construction permits; (iii) trade across borders, and; (iv) tax administration. Under BRELA,
some progress is being made. About 40% of the business names are now available in the BRELA database
for searching. With respect to taxes, TIN numbers are now available online and double inspections (by TRA
Ministry of Finance and Planning) have been removed for property assessments. While these measures
contribute to reducing cost and time incurred by businesses, much still needs to be done, particularly by
setting specific targets and dates for the Roadmap.
46. The goals for registration of formal enterprises and extension of credit to the private sector are on track
or have exceeded their targets. However, underlying indicators for these goals show less even progress and
the ICR for PPSDP was rated unsatisfactory in achieving its Development Objective. The project’s two core
components (privatization and business environment) were both rated unsatisfactory as was the overall
performance of the Bank. Threats to project implementation were systemically not addressed but ISR ratings
remained satisfactory in spite of a deterioration of the project’s performance.
47. According to the ICR, a significant shortcoming of PPSDP was the reversal in infrastructure reforms
during the project. Under PPSDP, most attempts to privatize large-scale infrastructure entities unraveled. A
Bank report from 2005 noted that by 2003, six key infrastructure enterprises28 (TANESCO, DAWASA,
TTCL, TICTS, TRL and ATCL) had some type of private participation in capital structure or in
management, and several showed operational and financial improvements compared to their status prior to
reforms. At the time of closure of PPSDP, only one enterprise (TICTS) was operating to a satisfactory
standard. The remaining five entities had all reverted to state ownership. ATCL underwent a reversal and renationalization in 2006 and during the search for a new strategic investor the airline made monthly losses
estimated at US$0.5 million and was banned from flying after an inspection by the International Air
Transport Association (IATA) in December 2008 found more than 500 operational issues. The joint venture
between Indian Rites and GoT (TRL) was terminated by Government in 2010 following disagreements. The
Dar es Salaam WSS, Tanzania Telecommunications Company (TTCL), and TANESCO all reverted to state

90

ownership and management after a period with various types of private management (management contracts,
concession, lease contracts).
48. One infrastructure company, TICTS, was privatized in an overall positive manner. During private
management of the Dar es Salaam Port container terminal throughput doubled, waiting times declined, and
container transshipments increased significantly. However, the circumstances of a 15 year extension of the
lease contract in 2005 are unclear, which contributes to a perception of lack of transparency around
infrastructure contracts, hurting Tanzania’s efforts to become a more attractive investment destination. In
relation to the port it is also unclear why Tanzania Port Authority (TPA) plays the dual role of landlord and
port operator (general cargo and some container handling operations). Last but not least, the Tanzania private
sector views the overall operational and financial situation of the port as poor and as an obstacle to
Tanzania’s economic growth.
49. Tanzania’s business environment has not improved during the CAS period. According to the latest
Enterprise Survey for Tanzania (2006), more than 70 percent of businesses name lack of access to reliable
electricity and the widespread outages as the main obstacle to growth, compared to an African average of
less than 40 percent. According to the Africa Infrastructure Diagnostic, Tanzanian electricity prices are
among the lowest in Eastern Africa, though this fact does not make Tanzania a more attractive investment
destination because the quality of electricity determines whether production is feasible. A blackout, such as
the one hitting Zanzibar for more than three months during December 2009 and March 2010, reduces
employment and damages business. The PRSC series and PPSDP have contributed to bringing tariffs to costrecovery levels by supporting the establishment of an independent regulator, Energy & Water Utilities
Regulatory Authority of Tanzania (EWURA). However, both TANESCO and DAWASCO continue a
decade-long struggle to reach financial sustainability due to low collection of payment and system losses
caused by leakage and theft.
50. In addition to directly and indirectly impeding businesses and Government’s poverty reduction goals,
low electricity tariffs are also a subsidy to the 14 percent of the population with access to electricity, mostly
the non-poor. The same principle applies to the Dar es Salaam WSS. In this regard, it is clear that the Bank’s
emphasis on higher tariffs to reach financial sustainability for utilities has been appropriate and the
approach should be continued under the next CAS.
51. For the majority of Tanzania’s entrepreneurs the ease of doing business has not improved significantly
during the CAS period as evidenced by the country’s absolute and relative decline in the annual Doing
Business Indicators rankings, notably in relation to neighboring countries, where Tanzania ranks lowest in
the 2011 Doing Business Indicator ranking. Rules, regulations, and license requirements put additional
burdens on businesses instead of adding support while basic requirements for a vibrant private sector such as
unrestricted competition, price information, and standard enforcements are not in place. Bank research, e.g.
Poverty Reduction in Tanzania since 2001: Good Intentions, Few Results (PREM technical note, May 2009)
on the disappointing progress in poverty reduction, finds that large Tanzanian firms are uncompetitive
compared to their East African peers and suggests that low incidence of exports is caused by administrative
costs and logistical issues at points of export (e.g., Dar seaport- and airport). According to the research, 90
percent of all firms in Dar es Salaam (which is estimated to generate 50-60 percent of Tanzania’s GDP)
employ fewer than five people. To ensure more competition, higher value addition per worker, higher
effectiveness, and higher salaries, firms must be given incentives to grow into the formal sector where they
can contribute to the tax base. From this perspective what should be considered is how Government can

91

contribute more to ensuring the removal of unnecessary, costly, and time consuming obstacles to private
entrepreneurship.

where land titles are traded openly and efficiently. However, several challenges persist, for instance in
relation to women entrepreneurs. Tanzania’s legal framework (e.g., inheritance laws) blocks women’s access
and rights to property in spite of women making up half of the employed population. An illustration is the
case of matrimonial assets at the time when customary laws are applied in inheritance/probate cases. In most
cases, women receive a minimum portion of the matrimonial assets irrespective of contribution before and
during marriage.
53. Legally, women in Tanzania have the right to own property as per the Constitution and laws that further
elaborate on these rights, like the Land Act No. 4 and 5, 1999, Unit Titles Act, 2008, and the Mortgage
Finance Special Provisions Act, 2008. These should support the development of women entrepreneurs
because they can secure business premises and finance against assets.
54. Despite legal provisions guaranteeing women’s rights to own property, the continued existence and
application of customary law - particularly with reference to property, inheritance and land rights - play a key
role in undermining women’s economic empowerment. Lack of land security acts as a disincentive to women
who are reluctant to invest and grow business/assets. Because women have much more limited access to
resources, their ability to embark, maintain or scale up productive activities is constrained.
55. The PRSC series supported completion of the land registry under the BEST component of PSCP, which
has resulted in Government‘s plan to issue about 12,000 titles of occupancy in urban areas in 2009/10 and
about 40,000 customary titles of occupancy in rural areas. The goal of completing the land registry has only
partially been met. Main reasons include lack of policy consensus on some provisions of the legal and
institutional framework and gaps in the legal and regulatory environment.
56. In all, progress towards an improved business environment, was not fully achieved. While
Government’s contribution to Outcome 2 has been wavering, Bank interventions for the outcome include
unsatisfactory supervision of PPSDP, satisfactory supervision and partial successful progress towards the DO
of PSCP, satisfactory supervision of FSP and moderately successful progress towards PDO albeit several
serious issues facing the project. The triggers related to doing business under the PRSC series were only
partially achieved.

CAS Outcome 1.3: Increased Agricultural Productivity [Partially Achieved]
57. The Bank has supported Government’s Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) through the
second PRSC series and the following SILs: the Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) from July
2006 to June 2013; the Participatory Agricultural Development and Empowerment Project (PADEP) from
March 2003 to June 2010, and; the Accelerated Food Security Program (AFSP) from May 2009 to June
2012. Objectives of the ASDS are to improve farm incomes and to reduce rural poverty in the medium and
long-term through a more profitable agriculture.
58. Despite Tanzania’s respectable recent growth in agriculture in this century, rural poverty and
malnutrition have not significantly decreased. The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. This could be
linked to Tanzania’s relatively high estimated population growth of 2.9 percentage points per year, or the
skewed distribution of economic growth between urban and rural areas, and economic sectors. Or this could
be an artifact of inaccuracies in the underlying data. It is believed that this conundrum will be at least
partially resolved once data from several ongoing surveys (the national panel survey, and on-going
agricultural census, and the impact assessment survey linked with the AFSP) become available.
59. The PRSC series supported Outcome 1.3 by linking a phased replacement of the crop cess tax and
improvements in the agricultural marketing regime to PRSC triggers. However, Government postponed the
first phase of the cess tax reduction while preparing an overhaul of local taxation aimed at guaranteeing
revenues for local governments, thereby hoping to improve market incentives in the agricultural sector. The
result, however, was that PRSC 8 Project Document shows myriad regulations and taxes and interventions by
LGAs, Crop Boards, and cooperatives creating an unfavorable investment climate and low profitability for
most cash and staple crop markets. Successful reform of Tanzania’s agricultural sector rests on increased
transparency in regulatory systems and more competition in the marketing system combined with reduction
of opportunities for monopolistic and rent-seeking activities.
60. The three investment operations supporting Outcome 1.3 have had mixed progress towards their
respective development objectives. Under AFSP, average maize yields have sharply increased from 1.12
tons/hectare in 2008/09 to 2.1 tons/hectare in 2010, but average rice yields have remained largely unchanged
at 1.79 tons/hectare, well below the target of 2.7 tons/hectare. . The underlying causes for the different trend
for the two crops are unclear at the time of writing of the CASCR. AFSP registered positive progress for
areas cultivated with improved seeds and fertilizers in the AFSP target area. Mechanization progressed at a
slower than expected pace as use of oxen remained unchanged since 2003 while use of tractors increased less
than expected, from 3 percent of households in 2003 to 8 percent of households in 2007. Use of tractors
would have to increase threefold to meet the target of 24 percent of households in 2013, which is highly
unlikely given past performance.
61. Data for ASDP similarly shows mixed progress towards the achievement of end-of-project targets for
most PDO indicators. Achievements under ASDP include farmers’ access to and use of agricultural
knowledge, technologies, marketing systems, and infrastructure. Agricultural private investment also
improved. The arable area under irrigation has increased in accordance with the project’s targets, and
construction of dip tanks is increasing reasonably well. On the other hand, construction of markets has been
slower than expected with only 439 markets completed in 2011, against the goal of 1,185 markets by 2012.
The attainment of this goal seems increasingly unlikely. The proportion of Tanzanian farmers using
improved seeds increased marginally from 18 percent to 19.5 percent, but this is far below ASDP’s target

93

value of 35 percent in 2013. But the proportion of farmers using improved livestock breeds has doubled and
appears likely to achieve the project’s target of 5 percent by 2013.
62. At first glance, PADEP has registered satisfactory progress on all PDO indicators; however, caution is
needed when evaluating PADEP’s impact, as the initial sample frame of data for assessment of PADEP’s
achievements was unexpectedly small. To address this issue, an extended impact assessment with a larger
sample has been undertaken and is expected to be completed by the end of March, 2011.
63. Besides GBS and individual project support, the Bank has provided substantial AAA under
Outcome 1.3. This includes: 2010 Annual Joint Agricultural Sector Implementation Review; a study on
agricultural taxation; East Africa Regional Maize Trade ESW; and two papers on international
competitiveness and policy options for Tanzania’s agricultural sector. These studies highlight many concerns
about agricultural policy, and inconsistencies in policy implementation. They cite the need to shift from an
inward orientation concentrating on food security, toward an external orientation encouraging private sector
investment and trade.
64. The mixed progress for Outcome 1.3 under the projects outlined above can be linked to the generally
slow and uncertain progress in implementing economic and policy reforms in Tanzania. Hence, progress
towards project targets depends largely on the Tanzanian Government and private sector. Measuring progress
is further complicated by lack of reliable data available at the time of this CASCR. The impact of the Bank’s
support through AAA has further been undermined by continuing questions about data quality and
uncertainty about official commitment to market reforms.

CAS Outcome 1.4: Improved Access to and Quality of Roads [Achieved]
65. Tanzania has progressed well in improving access to and quality of its trunk road network. The Bank
contributed substantially to these achievements through financial support to CTCP (August 2004 to
December 2009), CTCP II (April 2008 to June 2011), and the Transport Sector Support Project (September
2010 to May 2015) (TSSP). Under CTCP, higher than expected traffic volumes exceeded the target of 10
percentage points increase per annum. Similarly, roads in poor condition stood at five percent in 2009
compared to the target of 30 percent. All three transport projects have registered positive progress towards
DOs and Bank supervision has been rated satisfactory.

66. An important factor in the successful rehabilitation and extension of the trunk network has been the
good performance of the Road Fund, to which the second PRSC series contributed. The Road Fund increased
its revenue from around US$60 million per annum in 2005 to above US$200 million in 2009, one of the
largest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The PRSC series also contributed to enactment of the Road Bill, which
enhanced autonomy of the road agency. Bank support has further resulted in substantial progress for
improvement of Zanzibar Airport, which will allow for a substantial increase in passenger traffic to the island
of Unguja, stimulating the island’s tourism sector.

94

67. However, the road sector also faces challenges, notably in relation to budgetary constraints, budget
management, and sustainability of achievements realized over the CAS period. Increases for road
maintenance funds have not been sufficient to remove the maintenance backlog, exacerbating the risks in
shifting the burden of road rehabilitation to the future, especially as the gap in periodic maintenance
continues to widen. At the same time, the increase in allocations to upgrading of trunk and regional roads is
not enough to match the funding envisaged in this MTEF. Most upgrading of trunk and regional roads
initiated in 2009 continues with funding below forecasted needs, thus putting completion at risk and
reflecting shifts in GoT priorities. Currently, government finances 65 percent of road maintenance needs,
down from 80 percent after an increase in the fuel levy by 100 percent in the 2007/08 budget.
68. As a result of budgetary over commitments, Government faces the hard choice between increasing
funds for road maintenance, or focusing maintenance on a core road network by avoiding continuous
maintenance on some sections, which would therefore only be passable during the dry season. In addition,
there is a need to improve the oversight of procurement and contracting activities so that commitments are
transparently linked to approved budgets. The function of TANROADS as an executive agency should
further be strengthened to ensure sound financial planning and budget execution of the road sector.
69. While the road sector receives substantial funding, budget allocations for the railway and maritime
sectors have been minimal over the CAS period. CTCP financed upgrade and maintenance of roads as well
as improved operations of both rail networks. The CTCP ICR rated Bank supervision and progress toward
DPO moderately satisfactory based on good effectiveness of the road component and disappointing outcome
of the project’s railway component.
70. TRL suffered from lack of investment and maintenance for many years, both before and during the CAS
period, due to low profitability and contract disputes between share holders (RITES and Government). Total
freight carried by TRL on the Central Line in 2009 amounted to 0.54 million metric tons compared to the
target of 2.67 million metric tons. Despite annual GDP growth of 5-7 percentage points over the project
period traffic on the Central Line TRC railway at project closure was lower than at project appraisal. This
situation endangers future balanced development of transport corridors and limits the railway networks’
ability to absorb overload of traffic on the road network. The poor state of the railways is further exacerbated
by unlevel competition between railways and road haulers. The trucking industry enjoys a tax exemption
from excise duty (10-15 percent) while the railway sector pays fuel levies for the Road Fund.
71. In Dar es Salaam, trunk roads as well as feeder roads suffer from massive congestion caused by
historically low investments in urban roads, a rapidly growing vehicle fleet, poor public transport systems,
and complete lockdown of traffic when high-level members of government travel through the city. The Dar
es Salaam Transport Policy and System Development Master Plan address most of these issues and an
implementation strategy is underway. The challenge is how to allocate funds for implementation. It is
expected the Dar es Salaam Rapid Transit (DART – a bus transport system with dedicated lanes) will provide
some relief to the city’s transport problems, but procurement issues have delayed launching of the project by
more than a year (the original opening date was December 2009).
72. Outcome 1.4 has been largely achieved and progress in some areas has been well above targets. Bank
supervision and design of projects related to the outcome, including the PRSC series has largely been
satisfactory. However, Tanzania’s road sector faces budgetary challenges due to over-commitment and
underfunding.

95

CAS Outcome 1.5: Improved Management of Natural Resources [Partially Achieved]
73. The Bank supported Outcome 1.5 through the Forest Conservation and Management Project (FCMP)
and accompanying Global Environmental Fund (GEF) from June 2002 to December 2009, Marine and
Coastal Environment Project (MACEMP) from August 2005 to August 2011, Sustainable Management of
Mineral Resources Program (SMMRP) from September 2009 to June 2014, Lower Kihansi Environmental
Management Project (LKEMP) from December 2006 to December 2010, Lake Victoria Environmental
Management Project II (LVEMP II) from February 2009 to June 2013, and the Regional Stockpiles Program
(RSP) from December 2006 to December 2011.
74. In addition to IL, the PRSC series has contributed to improved management of natural resources through
the PRSC 8 trigger - approved and initiated implementation of an action plan to improve accountability and
transparency in allocating natural resource licenses and concessions. The PRSC 7 prior action was
transparency and accountability of licenses/concession allocations systems collected in the forestry, fisheries,
wildlife, minerals and oil & gas sectors.
75. FCMP aimed at assisting Government in policy implementation by developing a framework for longterm management and conservation of Tanzania’s forest resources. During implementation, the project was
plagued by implementation and disbursement delays due to changes in leadership, weak supervision in initial
years, and capacity constraints. The project was restructured twice in the span of one year, and at closing was
rated moderately unsatisfactory. Notably, the assessment of Bank performance was negative and the rating
was moderately unsatisfactory on quality at entry, supervision, and overall performance. The Client and
progress towards DO received similar ratings. The ICR found that project design had relied too heavily on
political commitment to institutional reform. The failure to establish the Tanzanian Forest Service (TFS) as
planned weakened the original commitment to involving the private sector in forest plantation management.
The lack of inventory data and a regulatory and procedural framework unfit for the allocation of concessions
undermined the commitment to privatization. By the end of the project three concession agreements were in
the process of being developed, and although MOUs were drafted, no contracts have been signed.
76. MACEMP aims to improve the sustainable management and use of Tanzania’s territorial seas and
coastal resources. An assessment of the project in June 2010 found achievement of the project’s DO
moderately unlikely citing questionable capacity of the lead agency, weak coordination arrangements, lack of
implementation readiness, and overly ambitious performance indicators. In particular, the mid-term quality
assessment of MACEMP (June, 2010) delivered a negative assessment of the Bank’s ratings of the project,
noting that ISR ratings have been far too optimistic, and the project an actual Problem Project for all of the
period under review resulting in an unsatisfactory rating for candor and realism in the project. Indicators for
MACEMP are not readily verifiable further questioning the basis for concluding that progress is on track and
achievable. Low mid-term ratings for MACEMP and the low final rating for the Forestry Project suggest a
need for more realism and in turn lower expectations in relation to natural resource management in Tanzania.
At present the sector is constrained by shortfalls in governance and law enforcement as well as weak
regulatory capacity.
77. SMMRP is a young project and one component (aerial resource surveys) uses the majority of the
budget. Progress towards PDO is rated satisfactory, but the project faces several issues, such as
disbursements not in accordance with plan, the percentage of household income levels in selected artisanal
and small scale mining has not moved from the baseline (zero), the time to process mineral rights
(exploration licenses) has deteriorated from the baseline. Tanzania's ranking as a mining investment

96

destination as evidenced by independent investor surveys has deteriorated from 22 out of 71 countries in
2008 to 35 out of 72 countries in 2009.
78. LKEMP has had satisfactory overall implementation of activities and PDO remains achievable. Major
achievements under the project include the development of research and monitoring protocols for Kihansi
Gorge ecosystem and establishment of a captive Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) population in Tanzania, an
important milestone in the process of reintroducing KST back to the wild in the Kihansi Gorge.
79. Project implementation for LVEMP II started slowly with first year activities focusing on hiring and
training members of the project implementation unit. Activities also focused on coordinating national
activities with regional activities implemented under the project by the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.
The project team expects that implementation will pick up by mid 2011 and a supervision mission will be
fielded during first half of 2011 to identify potential implementation bottlenecks.
80. RSP Tanzania (as well as other RSP countries in Africa) underwent restructuring as the PDO
(eliminating inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks and associated waste and implementing
measures to reduce and prevent future related risks) could not be satisfactorily achieved. In Tanzania heavily
contaminated soils have become an increasingly urgent issue and original project design was flawed needing
project design to be addressed as well as development of results frameworks for all RSP countries. During
the CAS period RSP Tanzania has addressed previous delays, which has translated into positive results for
the project. As a result of progress made since beginning of 2010, the IP rating has been upgraded from MS
to S while the PDO rating is kept at MS until the Level I restructuring is completed.
81. The Bank provided AAA in support of Outcome 1.5, most notably a Policy Note on the stakeholders in
Tanzania’s charcoal sector. The note emphasizes the importance of charcoal as a major source of energy in
Tanzania for the next 30 to 40 years, especially for the poor in both rural and urban areas. At the same time
the note identifies substantial disincentives for sustainable management of the charcoal sector due to
uncertainty about forest asset ownership, capacity of government agencies, and disempowerment of village
and district governments.
82. Progress against improved management of natural resources has been low overall. For FCMP, the final
DO is rated moderately unsatisfactory, and MACEMP’s DO and indicators appear, after the latest mission,
out of reach. Bank support through the PRSC series and AAA has been more successful, but does not change
the overall picture suggesting that progress against Outcome 1.5 has not been satisfactory.

CAS Outcome 1.6: Improved Quality of and Access to Electricity Services [Achieved]
83. Quality and access to electricity services has improved during the CAS period in line with the goals set
out in the CAS Results Matrix. The progress is a result of many small improvements in the power sector,
which the Bank financed through three projects, Songo Songo Gas Development and Power (SSGDP)
Generation Project (November 2001 to December, 2010), Tanzania Energy Development and Access
Expansion Project (December 2007 to March 2012), and the Backbone Transmission Investment Project
(December 2010 to March 2015). All three projects have shown satisfactory progress towards DOs and Bank
supervision is rated satisfactory.
84. Highlights for the three projects are the encouraging steps towards improvement of Tanzania’s
electricity transmission infrastructure (end user voltage is expected to switch from 190 volt to 218 volt

97

during first half of 2011). Access to electricity for rural households has improved noticeable, albeit from very
low levels with the percentage of population with access to electricity went from 8.2 percent in 2005 to 14.5
percent in 2010. Under SSGDP, completion of the gas pipeline from the Songo Songo gas field to Dar es
Salaam resulted in an increase of gas production for power generation from zero million cubic feet (mmcf) in
2001 to 65 mmcf in 2010, more than twice the target of 30 mmcf in 2010. Under TEDAP, the New
Electricity Act has been passed and the Rural Electricity Agency is fully staffed and operational. However,
the updated Power Sector Strategy has yet to be approved by the new Government.
85. Improvements in the power sector have taken place in spite of damages caused by corruption (e.g.
Richmond and IPTL) and general mismanagement. The challenge is now to sustain positive progress in
recent years and manage the necessary heavy investments caused by decades of inadequate maintenance and
extension of the power infrastructure.
86. At the same time, TANESCO’s future – whether private, public, or PPP – needs to be addressed.
Whichever model the government chooses, the current Tanzanian power system, which is characterized by
small capacity and dependence on hydropower, needs to be considered. It is widely agreed that demand for
power generation in Tanzania will grow rapidly over the coming five to ten years. Similarly, there is
consensus that increased short term power generation capacity can only come from thermal power
generation. While thermal power generation could be managed by both private and public entities, Tanzania's
Power System Master Plan recognizes that most new power in the short term will be generated by private
operators.
87. In relation to AAA, the Bank has financed studies on improved quality of electricity services, through a
note on tariffs, integrating SMEs in rural energy and two studies of the attempted privatization of
TANESCO. A number of lessons have emerged from these studies, among other: the role of the regulator in
relation to tariff adjustments is critical to the utility’s ability to maintain and extend its infrastructure. Low
tariffs are not pro-poor when the poor are not connected and increased tariffs would allow the utility to
maintain its infrastructure better. In the future, greater contract transparency could contribute to minimizing
rumors and politicization surrounding procurement and management of Tanzania’s power infrastructure.

Box 3: The Energy Sector and the Richmond Development Company
The power supply crisis of 2006 sheds light on the Richmond corruption case. Richmond Development Company
(RDC) was an unknown player in the energy sector until it won the contract for construction of an oil pipeline from
Dar es Salaam to Mwanza. However, soon after the award of the contract it became clear that the company could not
deliver on its promises. In spite of the lack of progress on the pipeline construction, TANESCO proceeded to
purchase generators from RDC to generate 100 MW of emergency power. The equipment arrived late and when
finally in Tanzania never worked as agreed. In spite of problems with both pipeline and power generation
Government honored the contract and continued payments to RDC.

88. Targets under Outcome 1.6 have largely been met and AAA has contributed to a better understanding of
the challenges to improved electricity services in Tanzania. While the energy sector suffered setbacks from
two corruption cases, these setbacks did not affect the development impact of the Bank’s operations. On this
background, Bank performance for Outcome 1.6 is rated satisfactory.

Cluster II: Improvement of Quality of Life and Social Wellbeing
98

89. Since 2004 Tanzania has forged ahead of other Sub Saharan countries in the 2009 UNDP Human
Development Index – which covers MKUKUTA Cluster II - Improvement of quality of life and social well
being – and now ranks 157 out of 182 countries.
90. Access to social services increased significantly during the CAS period due to substantial increases in
Government spending. Bank financed projects have strongly supported this development through increased
financing of activities in social services provision via the PRSC series and successive projects in education,
health, HIV/AIDS, and WSS. In addition, the World Bank has supported the building and strengthening of
local government systems. Considerable funds for education, health infrastructure and water have been
utilized through the LGCDG.
91. However, progress has been uneven across Cluster II. For instance, access to education has improved,
but the quality of education has suffered, especially at the secondary level. In health, progress has been more
uniform, albeit starting from a very low level, and has followed a general trend for improved health in Sub
Saharan Africa.
92. Malnutrition is one of the most serious health problems in Tanzania and the single biggest contributor to
child mortality. It is a main inhibitor of educational performance and a key impediment to economic growth
through its consequences on health, the ability to learn and labor productivity. According to the preliminary
2009/10 DHS report, little progress has been made with respect to nutrition. Exclusive breastfeeding is still
not widely practiced with only 23 percent of all children breastfed as recommended for the first six months.
Stunting rates are extremely high and there has been no significant improvement in stunting rates or undernutrition since 2004/5. Estimates for 2010 suggest that 43,000 children will die prematurely due to
malnutrition. The only successful nutrition program in Tanzania is the vitamin A supplementation program
which is heavily donor dependent leaving the program in jeopardy when/if DPs would withdraw.
93. In retrospect, the Bank did not address the issue of nutrition in spite of malnutrition’s impact on
children’s ability to grow, learn and earn an income as adults, and thus contribute to economic growth.
Malnutrition retards cognitive development and lowers school performance. About 130 children die every
day in Tanzania from diseases they would have survived if they had been well-nourished. It weakens the
immune system making illnesses more dangerous. Nutrition interventions are known, but how to implement
them within the Tanzanian context is less clear.

94. In WSS, more people have gained access to a safe source of water across Tanzania. However, more than
forty percent of the population in rural areas still has more than 30 minutes to walk to a safe and clean water
point while 16 percent of the urban population has no access to piped or protected water as their main
drinking water source. In the largest city, Dar es Salaam, residents suffer from the continued poor
performance of the WSS utility. The poor disproportionately lack access to adequate WSS services while at
the same time they pay the highest price for basic goods such as potable water.

99

95. For HIV/AIDS, Tanzania has managed to stem the epidemic, but it is not clear whether the efforts are
sustainable and whether the decline in HIV prevalence is due to societal changes in sexual behavior or to the
increased mortality of AIDS infected patients.
96. The challenges of effectively managing urbanization in Tanzania are becoming increasingly severe
since the country’s urban population is growing by more than 3.5 percent a year, twice the country’s average
population growth rate. The urban population share—or urbanization rate— is estimated to increase from 24
percent in 2002 to 39 percent in 2030. By then, 20 million people will be living in Tanzanian towns and
cities. The city of Dar es Salaam with an estimated population of about 4 million in 2010 (about ten percent
of the country’s total population) has a population growth rate of 4.3 percent per year, making it the third
fastest growing city in Africa and among the ten fastest growing cities of the world.

CAS Outcome 2.1: Increased Access to Quality Post-Primary Education [Partially Achieved]
97. The Bank has supported education in Tanzania with the following education specific project: Secondary
Education Development Project I (SEDP I) between 2004 and 2008, followed by Secondary Education
Development Project II (SEDP II) from July 2010 to December 2015, Zanzibar Basic Education
Improvement Project (ZUSP) from June 2007 to July 2013, and Science and Technology Higher Education
Program (STHEP) from May 2008 to June 2013. In addition, the Bank has supported education in Tanzania
through Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) and the Local Government Support Project (LGSP). The
Bank has also provided support to the education sector through the second PRSC series.
98. The ICR for SEDP I rated PDO Satisfactory and Bank contribution to PDO as satisfactory. However,
the IEG Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for SEDP I rated the PDO moderately
unsatisfactory based on significant shortcomings in the project’s achievement of objectives, particularly
learning outcomes, capacity building, and relevance of project design. Bank performance was rated
moderately satisfactory based among other on a quick and flexible response to the Borrower’s request for
more support to the education sector, rapid preparation, which attempted to harmonize the project.
99. The ongoing education projects (SEDP II, ZUSP, and STHEP) are all rated Satisfactory for PDO and
Bank contribution. The three programs have supported government’s ambitious education agenda formulated
in 2001. The ruling party promised a primary school facility in every ward and enrollment in primary and
secondary education subsequently soared. However, at the secondary level, the surge of pupils was not
matched by a similar rise in qualified teachers (the ratio of qualified teachers to pupils has remained at 1:51).
Textbooks and other necessary inputs to quality education have also not followed the increased enrollment.
These service delivery failures have resulted in reduced student learning. Form IV pass rate has decreased
significantly from 2009’s 72.51% to 50.40% in year 2010. The PRSC 8 document notes that these
developments have led to an overall decline in quality of education outcomes.
100. While the entire education sector has experienced substantial enrollment increases and a nominal
increase in basic education spending, resource allocation for secondary education has been erratic and
uneven until 2008/09. The 2010 Rapid Budget Analysis records that secondary education received a very
large nominal increase (71 percent) in 2009/10. During the same period, primary education’s allocation has
been practically frozen in per capita terms. Overall, education funds have been disproportionately channeled
to tertiary education where funding for an inefficient student loan scheme, has been increased. However, the
number of science and technology students enrolled has declined from 2,631 in 2007 to 2,184 in 2010 instead
of increase towards the target of 7,844 in 2013.

100

101. Quality of education is noticeably lower in remote areas where teachers are less willing to relocate. The
2010 Field Review of Decentralized Investments (FREDI) mission and the SEDP II preparation missions
found that FY06/07 and FY07/08 funds from the Capital Development Grants (CDG) were mostly directed
to construct secondary schools. However, many of these schools suffered from critical shortages in teachers
and necessary facilities such as laboratories, libraries, and toilets. These challenges are a result of high
pressure to implement the Government’s initiative of one secondary school in every ward.
102. Secondary education quality has also been affected by quality issues at the primary level. Even though,
according to official data, net enrollment in basic education has reached 95 percent in 2009 up from 59
percent in 2005, the quality and equity of primary education has remained a concern.29
103. The rise in primary enrollment benefited poor households in particular, but did not translate into similar
high transition rates to secondary education. A serious side effect of the increase in basic education
enrolment is that pupils enroll too late and stay in school for too long. The trend is particularly noticeable for
pupils from poorer families. For the education system in general, the late start and long transition to
secondary education impacts negatively on chances to transition and complete secondary education.
104. Learning in Tanzania was recently assessed by UWEZO - an NGO specializing in education quality in
East Africa. UWEZO's findings were announced in September 2010 and are sobering; according to its survey
(carried out in 38 of 133 districts covering a total of 42,033 children in 22,800 households), one in five
primary school (primary school goes from Standard 1 to Standard 7) leavers cannot read a Standard 2 level
story in Kiswahili. Half the children who complete primary school cannot read a Standard 2 level story in
English. In Mathematics, 31.5 percent of Standard 7 pupils cannot do Standard 2 level multiplication. One in
10 children complete primary school with no mathematical skills at all. UWEZO warns that this situation
provides a poor foundation for further learning and analysis, affecting science and business particularly
negatively.
105. The challenge for Tanzania is to transform the success in enrollment into better educated children, who
will enter a labor market increasingly open to competition from neighboring countries. In hindsight, neither
the DPLs nor Sector Adjustment Loans have been appropriate for the education sector as technical and
implementation capacity is weak and, therefore, resources have been spent inefficiently and at too high a
cost. An example of inefficient use of resources for the education sector is the disproportionate spending on
an ambitious and unsustainable school construction program. The initiative did not have enough financing to
complete the construction of the schools and limited focus on inputs and processes that would improve
quality. Moving forward, use of Adjustable Program Lending (APL) should ensure provision of technical
assistance and availability of funds for the medium term, which would facilitate the sustainability of results
over time.
106. Progress towards outcome 2.1 has been positive in terms of access, but the foundations for good
teaching have not improved during the CAS period, and the education sector suffers from funding
imbalances across primary, secondary, and tertiary education levels. The Bank has produced relevant AAA
on key issues facing the primary and secondary education levels. This work is a result of the collaboration
29

Technical observations (PREM-HD policy note, September 2008) based on cross reference between DHS, EMIS, and
household-based sources indicate that the routine data system over-estimates net enrollment. According to the PREMHD note, real net primary enrollment is thus more likely to be around 80 percent.

101

between PREM and the education team, and has provided vital information to the debate. The ICR for SEDP
I, the only education project which closed during the CAS period, rated project outcome as moderately
unsatisfactory, while the ongoing operations are all regarded as Satisfactory. Overall, while significant
progress is evident in terms of access, there is deterioration in qualified teacher/pupil ratio, availability of
capitation grants, and poor infrastructure leading to falling Form IV results.

CAS Outcome 2.2: Improved Provision and Quality of Health Services [Partially Achieved]
107. The World Bank supports the health sector in Tanzania through a SWAp, which uses a combination of
budget support, pooled funding, and targeted project financing. Eleven development partners participate in
the pooled basket fund in order to reduce transaction costs and strengthen government systems. The Health
Sector Development Project (HSDP) II, which contributes to the basket fund, and provides non-pooled funds,
has received two rounds of additional financing. The Health Basket fund has provided direct financing to
local governments to help finance the operations of front-line facilities. The use of these funds is monitored
by the MOHSW and development partners to ensure that they are used in accordance with the objectives of
the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP). In addition to the funding to districts, health basket funds are also
used to provide central support, primarily in the areas of medical supplies and drugs, human resources
development, and overall support to health sector reforms. The World Bank contribution to the HBF has
been about 15-20 percent, on average.
108. In addition to the HBF, HSDP II has financed malaria prevention, including retreatment and bed nets,
which have had a direct impact morbidity and mortality attributable to malaria. International evidence
suggests that mortality is reduced by 6 lives per year for each 1,000 bed nets provided, suggesting that the
2.4 million nets purchased with World Bank financing are saving about 14,400 children per year from dying
from malaria, or some 72,000 children over the estimated 5-year life of these nets. Other non-basket
activities included support to purchasing emergency obstetrical equipment and support for the establishment
of a national food fortification program, which is estimated to have a benefit-cost ratio of 8.22:1. In addition,
a health sector review, assessing progress on agreed outcome targets, adequacy of resource allocation,
achievement of sector milestones, and adequacy of stakeholder consultations, was successfully carried out as
a PRSC-8 trigger, and it is also included as a preliminary PRSC-9 trigger. Tanzania is also a beneficiary of
the East Africa Public Health Laboratory Networking Project, approved in May, 2010, to establish a network
of accessible public health laboratories in the region.
109. Tanzania is on track to meet some health related Millennium Development Goals, though challenges
remain. The recent preliminary report of the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2010 finds notable
progress in a wide range of health and well-being indicators. Wider use of bed nets has contributed to a drop
in under-five mortality of 44 percent from 144 per 1000 births in 1999 to 81 in 2010, and a drop in infant
mortality from 99 in 1999 to 51 in 2010, reductions which were among the greatest in Sub-Saharan Africa
over the past several years. The use of insecticide treated bed nets by pregnant women has increased
dramatically from 26 percent in 2007 to 57 percent in 2010. This, combined with a 25 percent increase in the
share of births taking place at a health facility (41 to 52 percent over 2005-9), has contributed to the fall in
maternal mortality rate from 578 deaths per 100,000 births in 2004/5 to 454 in 2010, though the rate, while
reduced, is still unacceptably high.
110. About 75 percent of children between 12 and 23 months old are fully vaccinated and only 2 percent of
children have not received any vaccines. Coverage declines for subsequent doses, with 96 percent receiving
the first DPT dose and only 88 percent receiving all three. Regional differentials are modest, with urban

102

children more likely than rural children to have received the recommended vaccinations. In addition,
coverage increases with increased education level of the mother. To recognize the need for further
improvements in this area, the Health Basket Fund is financing improvements to immunization coverage.
111. Over the CAS period the government’s health budget per capita has almost doubled and is expected to
reach US$14 in 2010/11. However, the proportion of government budget devoted to health has declined over
recent years. Between the actual 2005/6 budget and the estimates for 2010/11, the share of the health sector
in the budget has fallen from almost 12 percent to slightly over 8 percent, raising concerns about the overall
priority of the health sector. The percentage increased in 2010/11, but this was largely due to a significant
increase in grants from the Global Fund, which is now close to half of the MOHSW budget. However, as
these grants are used and the emerging constraints on Global Fund financing take hold, the proportions of the
government budget devoted to health could once again decline. The flow of funds is still problematic,
especially to the lower levels of care. Human resources for health, in number, skill and geographical
distribution, are one of the most important supply-side constraints. In addition, there has been relative lack of
progress in the implementation of effective public-private partnership.
112. During the negotiations for HSDP II, the government and the World Bank had agreed to fold financial
support for the health sector into the Poverty Reduction Support Credits by 2008, instead of implementing a
third phase of HSDP. The conditions for the shift in IDA financing include increased allocation to the health
sector, improved procurement performance, and annual reviews of the Health Care Waste Management Plan.
The proposed shift is currently on hold as there are outstanding issues with each of the conditions, coupled
with concern that a move to budget support would exclude the World Bank from the policy dialog in the
sector. Further, a joint external evaluation of the sector in 2007 (funded by Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland) highlighted the effectiveness of the SWAp approach, and the
Basket Fund in particular, in getting funds to the frontlines and improving outcomes. In the absence of a
public finance mechanism, the pooled funds are instrumental in financing service delivery at the district
level.
113. As the World Bank operation supports the sector through a SWAp, the HSDP II outcomes mirror the
indicators of the HSSP, as well as those in the MKUKUTA. A number of project targets have been exceeded
(infant mortality, under-five mortality, health spending per capita, TB completion rate) and have been
accordingly revised upward for the additional financing. The ratio of infant mortality rate between the richest
and poorest quintiles is on track for being achieved, while the total fertility rate is not likely to be met, so it
has been adjusted upward. HSDP II closed on December 31, 2010, with satisfactory ratings for both
implementation support and progress towards achievement of project development objective.

CAS Outcome 2.3: Reduced HIV Prevalence between 15-24 Years [Partially Achieved]
114. Bank support to reduced HIV prevalence among the 15-24 year old took place under Tanzania MultiSectoral HIV/AIDS Program (TMAP) from July 2003 to March 2010. World Bank support was provided
within the framework of the umbrella multi-country AIDS Program (MAP) for the Africa region. The project
focused on social mobilization through the development of a Community AIDS Response Fund (CARF),
administered largely through LGAs, as well as public sector activities on prevention, care and support, and
institutional support for the Tanzanian Commission for AIDS (TACAIDS).
115. During the life of the project the prevalence of HIV/AIDS dropped from 2.1 percent in 2003/4 to 1.2
percent for the 15-19 year old. However, the prevalence for the 19-24 year old increased from 5.2 percent in

103

2003/4 to 5.3 percent in 2007/8. The number of pregnant women testing positive for HIV dropped from 6.8
percent in 2003/4 to 5.0 percent in 2007/8. The number of people with advanced HIV infection receiving
Anti-Retro Viral combination therapy has increased tenfold from 20,588 in 2005 to around 226,000 in 2010,
though unmet ARV needs still exist.
116. A number of behavioral characteristics in relation to HIV/AIDS appear to have changed. Three in four
men and women know that condoms can reduce the risk of contracting HIV during sexual intercourse.
Almost 90 percent of men and women indicate that limiting sex to one unaffected partner who has no other
partners reduces the chances of infection. There has been a marked decrease in the share of people,
particularly men, who have had more than one sexual partner in the last 12 months. About 29 percent of all
women currently use some method of contraception with a higher share (34 percent) for currently married
women and even higher share (48 percent) for single sexually active women. However, the stigma against
HIV/AIDS persists, and some traditional social or religious values hinder behavioral changes that curtail HIV
transmission.
117. The ICR for TMAP found that the project was developed as an emergency response, with little known
about the complexity of the epidemic at the beginning of the project. Efficacy and efficiency of the project
were deemed modest and Bank support to the project was rated moderately unsatisfactory as no attempt was
made to address the general design problems, which included eligibility criteria and absorptive capacity of
MDAs and CSOs. The Bank did not use its comparative advantage in building institutions, assessing
alternatives, and improving the selection of alternatives regarding AIDS efforts. In addition, project
objectives were complex and unfocused, and implementation began without baseline data or targets in place.
On the basis of the substantial relevance, modest efficacy, and modest efficiency, the overall project outcome
rating is moderately unsatisfactory, while quality of supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory by the
ICR team. The World Bank has decided not to finance a follow-on HIV/AIDS project because there are
substantial global and bilateral resources available to Tanzania, such as the Global Fund, the President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and others.

CAS Outcome 2.4: Improved access to Water and Sanitation in Rural/Urban Areas [Partially
Achieved]
118. The World Bank has contributed to the water and sanitation sector through the Rural Water Supply
Project from March, 2002, to June, 2010, the Water Sector Support Project (WSSP) from February, 2007, to
February, 2012, and the Dar Water Supply and Sanitation Project from May, 2003, to November, 2010. The
WSSP supports the government through a SWAP financing the Water Sector Development Program, drafted
in 2006. Under WSDP a total of US$627 million (corresponding to 52 percent of the revised project budget
of US$1,204 million) has been disbursed over the three years of implementation. This has among other
resulted in the promotion of institutional and legal reforms at the trans-boundary, national and basin levels.
119. However, WSS in Tanzania faces major challenges, among other in relation to systematic planning,
monitoring and reporting. In addition, implementation of WSSP has been seriously constrained by delays in
Ministry of Water in submission of required documentation for basket financing advance, weak capacity in
the ministry, and insufficient MoU compliance. WSSP lacks a senior program manager as well as
professional experts, which has contributed to lack of effective planning and budgeting.
120. The two programs (DSWSSP and WSDP) have not been able to clearly demonstrate achievement of
program outcomes due to limited capacity for monitoring and evaluation. Reported progress on output and

104

outcomes is lower than original targets due to increased unit costs, changed technology mix, and overambitious targets. Vital government institutions, including the sector ministry, suffer from continued undercapacity to manage the programs and do not comply with financial, procurement and safeguard procedures.
Moreover, a recent WSDP Special Audit Report issued by the Controller and Auditor General (CAG)
confirmed serious accountability issues.
121. The increased funding for the sector has had some impact on access to improved water sources.
However, many targets will not be met and more than forty percent of the population in rural areas still has to
walk more than 30 minutes to a safe and clean water point, while 16 percent of the urban population has no
access to piped or protected water as their main drinking water source. The share of Tanzanians with access
to improved sanitation facilities has decreased from 22 percent in 2006 to 21 in 2008.
122. The issues with the WSS utility in Dar es Salaam are even more serious. DSWSSP has not managed to
address the fundamental price and service challenges facing the poor. Studies carried out by NGOs and
universities conclude that the poor in Dar es Salaam pay a much higher price for water because they are not
connected to the city water. Instead, the poor buy water from neighbors, kiosks, or street vendors at much
higher rates than those of the water utility. A recent study conducted by an NGO at 25 water kiosks in Dar es
Salaam found that all kiosks charged prices above the tariff set by EWURA, some charging up to ten times
the price set by the regulator.
123. The Dar Water Supply and Sanitation project closed in November, 2010, with a marginally
unsatisfactory rating for achievement of development objective. The current ratings for the Water Sector
Support project are moderately unsatisfactory for both implementation progress and achievement of
development objective.

Cluster III: Governance and Accountability
124. Tanzania's National Framework on Good Governance provides the overall mechanism for governance
and anti-corruption reforms. The Framework places high priority in addressing poor governance in the public
sector that is associated with financial management, corruption, low level of service provision, tax evasion,
and unnecessary bureaucracy. The five main instruments for reform, the “core reforms”, in the sector are the
Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP), the Public Service Reform Program (PSRP), the
Local Government Reform Program (LGRP), the National Anticorruption Strategy (NACSAP), and the
Legal Sector Reform Program (LSRP). Since 2000 the Bank has supported the GoT in implementing the five
core reforms through IDA credits for PSRP, ATIP, and LGSP. Implementation of these core reforms has
been slow with LGRP rated moderately satisfactory while LSRP, PSRP, and PFMRP are rated unsatisfactory
by the Bank.
125. Tanzania is ahead of many
countries in sub-Saharan Africa in
terms of public sector reform and
improved management, transparency
and accountability of public resource
management. At the start of the CAS
period in 2007, Tanzania had
completed the first and second stages
of public sector reforms, which

Figure 5: Tanzania’s CPIA Ranking and Score, 2005- 2009

105

include ensuring budget discipline through control of the wage bill, downsizing the civil service, improving
taxation and introducing performance management in the public sector. The third stage of public sector
reforms, which includes deepening of the reforms, as well as ensuring their sustainability and linkages to
service delivery, has been difficult and more demanding. This challenge is reflected in the current state of
public sector reforms as well as in the status of relevant projects supported by the Bank and the overall
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score for Tanzania. Tanzania’s CPIA score has been
relatively high compared to other IDA countries, but dropped in 2008, largely driven by a decline in scores
for public sector management and institutions, in particular in the area of quality of budget and financial
management, as well as transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector (Figure 1).

Partially achieved

CAS Outcome 3.1: Improved socio-economic basic services and safety net through community
participation [Partially Achieved]
126. The World Bank has supported the improvement of basic services through community participation the
Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) II from November, 2004, through June, 2013, as well as through a
number of other sector operations, including health, TMAP, and LGSP. In addition, one of the two PRSC-8
strategic objectives concerns Outcome 3.1 as it focuses on expansion of effective service delivery through
the government budget. Outcome 3.1 supports both CAS outcomes under Cluster III and has been pursued
through the implementation of sector strategies, and the strengthening of monitoring and evaluation systems
in selected service delivery sectors. The relevant PRSC-8 trigger is a satisfactory water, health and education
sector review and it was successfully carried out and is included as a preliminary trigger for PRSC-9.
127. To strengthen demand-side accountability, various measures have been introduced such as the
publication of quarterly grant amount transfers to LGAs in national and local newspapers, postings of local
government budgets in public places, and a web-based system (http://www.logintanzania.net) for disclosure
of information on local government finances. Progress has been noted in the participation of citizens in local
government issues and at the community level. Examples include participation of community members, Civil
Society Organizations (CSO), faith-based service providers, and the private sector in health planning and
implementation at the local level, and introduction of community score cards. Under LGRP, communities
prepare their local plans under the Opportunities and Obstacles for Development (O&OD) process, which are
consolidated at the District level and prioritized for funding using the Council Development Grants. The
plans of the Tanzania Social Action Fund are interwoven into those of the local governments.
128. TASAF II provides a multi-sectoral response to the needs of communities. Communities can request,
implement and monitor subprojects in health, education, water and sanitation, income generation, savings,
access to markets, etc. The demand-driven approach empowers communities to take advantage of marketcreated opportunities as well as utilize resources made available from or through Government.
Implementation of the Fund has been rated satisfactory and there has been a marked increase in the number
of people with access to improved socio-economic services, overall, through the many interventions, the
project has reached 20,017,227 direct beneficiaries.

106

129. With regard to health services, 10,722,052 people have access to enhanced health facilities compared to
6,146,533 in 2004; through other economic infrastructure such as roads, markets, irrigation schemes
3,199,000 people have been served compared to 693,000 in 2004; for communities with access to safe water,
the number of beneficiaries increased to 1,510,250 from 350,000 in 2004, this has the potential of reducing
water borne diseases. In addition, availability of water nearby also releases time that would have been spent
on fetching water to use in productive activities at the household level. There have been improvements in the
student to classroom ratio, through support to construction of education infrastructure, such that 560,516
children have access to education services compared to 244,162 in 2004 in the targeted areas, the pupil
classroom ratio has also improved from 70:1 in 2004 to 45:1 in 2010); increase in income, inform the actual
percentage increase in incomes of beneficiaries, information is also available from the independent
assessment commissioned by TASAF in 2010). Public works program and the support to vulnerable groups,
among the targeted beneficiaries the percentage of people who took three meals a day had increased from 30
percent to 67 percent, this could also mean that there is improved nutritional status. Also the beneficiaries
spending power is reported to have increased for, clothes and education)), savings (21,712 savers compare to
4,054 in 2004), and the number of person- days provided (15,864,030 compared to 5,431,992 in 2004).
About 85 percent of community members from sampled areas are satisfied with the quality and delivery of
basic social services (using community score card). savings, and the number of person- days provided.
130. TASAF II has received two additional financings, the second coming from the Crisis Response
Window. The government has initiated steps to turn the Social Action Fund into a legal entity. The entity
will be responsible for building community-based institutions with a strong focus on improving the
livelihoods of poor people. TASAF II is one of the vehicles for implementation of MKUKUTA,
championing the government's social protection agenda and CDD approach. The focus of TASAF II will be
on livelihood enhancing initiatives such as Community Savings and Investment Promotion, incomegenerating activities, social safety nets, and Community Based Conditional Cash Transfers, moving away
from infrastructure construction. The Bank has initiated the preparation of a follow-up operation, which will
be strongly grounded in MKUKUTA II, and will shift focus from a social fund mode to a social safety net.
131. Despite its successes, TASAF II’s effect on poverty reduction is not clear with poverty rising instead of
falling over the CAS period. Concerns remain regarding its scope, whether it is broad enough to effect deep
and sustainable improvement of socio-economic well-being. In addition, TASAF is not the only instrument
for CDD and its relationship with LGAs is less than strictly delineated, which raises concerns about
allocation and prioritization of funding, crowding out and elite capture. Based on the satisfactory progress
towards meeting CAS outcomes while noting the remaining issues, including questions regarding attribution
and the general quality of data, Bank performance in the improvement of socio-economic basic services and
safety net through community participation is rated as moderately satisfactory.

CAS Outcome 3.2: Improved Management, Transparency and Accountability of Public
Resource Management [Partially Achieved]
132. The Bank has contributed to the improved management, transparency and accountability of public
resource management through the Performance, Results and Accountability Project (PRAP) from September,
2007, to December, 2012, the Accountability, Transparency and Integrity Project (ATIP) from May, 2006, to
December, 2011, and the Local Government Support Project (LGSP) from November, 2004, to June 2012.
Outcome 3.2 has been pursued through work on improvement of the quality of budget preparation and
execution, strengthening the integrity and soundness of the PFM systems, improving the effectiveness of
public administration, focusing on civil service reform and wage bill management, and improving the

107

institutional framework for anti-corruption and accountability of the state. In addition, as discussed under
CAS Outcome 3.1, the PRSC series supports its strategic objective of improving service delivery through the
budget by aiming to strengthen PFM systems, as well as anti-corruption and accountability institutions. A
successfully completed trigger for PRSC-8 is the approval of amendments to the Public Procurement Act of
2004 increasing the autonomy of Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA).
133. Tanzania has taken action in terms of law enforcement and recovery of funds. Investigations and
prosecutions of high ranking officials and businessmen involved in high profile cases (e.g. BOT External
Payment Account, Richmond energy, and Alex Stewart) have been undertaken, but only one conviction has
been made in relation to seven grand corruption cases over the CAS period. The share of court cases
outstanding for two or more years has declined only marginally from 27.9 percent in 2005 to 25.9 percent in
2009.Performance of the PCCB has often been hampered: of the 22 grand corruption cases prosecuted in
2009, only one (relating to a Central Bank construction contract) has been adjudicated in the high court. Over
the past three years there have been delays in prosecuting companies involved in the Bank of Tanzania EPA
case, and in recovering funds diverted in that case. There has not been adequate follow up on the Richmond
scandal despite recommendations of a Parliamentary inquiry. Lack of progress in prosecution of high-level
cases sends a signal of impunity about grand corruption.
134. The World Bank supports judicial reform in Tanzania through ATIP. The project contributes to
improved access to judicial and legal services through skill development and the strengthening of oversight
and watchdog institutions. A major achievement of the project is the establishment of a law school that
provides graduate training to lawyers in a set of skills required for public practice. A total of 800 lawyers
have been trained, most of which have been absorbed in the public legal institutions, thus enhancing the legal
and judicial services. Progress in other areas, including reducing the backlog of cases in the court system and
expanding access to justice, has been slow. Lack of progress towards development objectives has resulted in
Marginally Unsatisfactory status for the project for more than a year. In response, the project has been
restructured and focused on skills development related to the law school, improvement of judicial business
processes to reduce case backlog, construction of primary courts, and support for legal aid to the poor to
improve access to justice. Other bilateral partners have committed to funding the legal and judicial
component, further strengthening support for reforms in the sector.
135. Although Tanzania's public financial management (PFM) system is more solid than most in Africa,
progress has been slow in the past few years, and in some areas the PFM systems have deteriorated. The
Bank and other Development Partners are supporting the PFM Reform Program through Basket Funding, but
there are ongoing implementation challenges with this program. The legal framework for PFM has improved
with the enactment of a new Audit Act in 2008 and an ongoing revision of the Public Finance Act. A new
economic classification of the budget is being introduced, the annual accounts are now compliant with the
format of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), Internal Audit has been strengthened
and is being made independent, and there have been major improvements in the functioning of the National
Audit Office (NAO). On public procurement reform, the government established the Public Procurement
Regulatory Authority (PPRA) in 2005, as well as additional complaint mechanisms including Public
Procurement Appeals Authority, and a Procurement Policy Unit within MOFEA. A draft Public Procurement
Bill (which will replace the Public Procurement Act of 2004), awaiting Parliament approval, further
strengthens the powers of the PPRA, though it contains a number of weaknesses pertaining to approval
authority of contract awards, e-procurement, integration of procurement planning in the budgetary process,
etc.

108

136. These improvements have, however, been too slow to prevent a gradual deterioration of the overall
quality of PFM systems, as reflected by declining PEFA scores over the past five years. The PEFA scores for
2009 were worse than the PEFA scores for 2005.The 2008 report of the Controller and Auditor General
(CAG) has pointed to problems including weaknesses with the Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) both at the central and local government level, poor bank reconciliation, lack of reliable
information on government revenues, weak internal controls. Cash management remains a major challenge.
In 2009, there were over 36,000 government bank accounts in commercial banks. Steps have been taken to
close around 10,000 of them, but progress is slow. Due to poor control over government cash - spending
units face a large amount of unpredictability regarding fund flows, adversely impacting budget execution and
service delivery. In addition, a 2010 systems audit by KPMG found that the government has not received
optimal value for money for the IFMIS system and the introduction of the system without an accompanying
capacity building may have decreased accountability in some LGAs. The government has expressed an
intention to tackle some of the important issues concerning the IFMIS in the wake of an NAO diagnostic
report (PRSC-9 preliminary trigger).
137. The World Bank's Performance, Results and Accountability Project (PRAP), approved in FY08, has
been supporting the government in enhancing the capacity, performance and accountability of public
servants in service delivery through the use of modern performance management tools for MDAs and LGAs.
Specifically, the project focuses on the improvement of regulatory capacity, improved use of performance
management systems, as well as improved management of public servants. While the development of
performance management instruments, manuals and guidelines has been satisfactory and largely achieved
during the previous CAS, their implementation and integration in MDA functions under the current CAS has
been weak. Consequently, the project has been rated Marginally Unsatisfactory for progress towards
Development Objectives. The slow uptake of demand-side interventions, as well as reports of improper use
of funds, has necessitated an upcoming restructuring of the project. The restructuring is expected to lead to a
select set of MDAs and LGAs that will be fully supported to use performance management tools to enhance
public service delivery in collaboration with other reform programs. Accountability mechanisms such as the
Inspector-General, Ombudsman, and independent audit exist such as the Prevention and Combating
Corruption Bureau (PCCB), the Ethics Secretariat (ES) and the Controller and Auditor General (CAG).
While the CAG enjoys a wide level of freedom consistent follow-up on CAG recommendations remains
weak and the quality of the work undertaken by the NAO remains a matter of concern. In FY 11 the World
Bank advised the CAG that seven project related audit reports were rejected due to poor quality.
138. The first National Governance and Corruption Survey was done in 2009. It found widespread petty
corruption in the police, judiciary and health services. Government has yet to act fully to cut corruption in
these institutions. Integrity committees have been established in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies
(MDAs) and Local Government Authorities (LGAs) to handle corruption allegations, but they do not work as
well as they should.
139. The Ethics Secretariat (ES) is trusted with ensuring leaders are ethical and do not have a conflict of
interest in their official duties has not functioned effectively. Since its establishment in 1995, there has not
been a single tribunal sitting and ES annual reports are not published. A register of public assets held by the
ES and public complaints against leaders have been the main instruments for accountability of public
officials but the register is not effective since it cannot be verified as public access to the register is by
discretion of the ES Commissioner. As a result, prospects of sanctions from unethical or corrupt behavior are
low and the effect on public officials who further their own interests more than the public interest is low.

109

140. Implementation of the decentralization by devolution (D by D) policy has increasingly given Local
Government Authorities (LGAs) in Tanzania a leading role in the delivery of primary services. Before the
launch of D by D most services were delivered by central ministries; currently education (primary and
secondary), and primary health care have been shifted to LGAs. The increased responsibilities have required
larger resource allocations. The share of total GoT budget allocated to LGAs increased from 16 percent in
FY 2005/06 to 25 percent in FY 2009/10.
141. In addition, since 2004/05, Government has successfully implemented and mainstreamed the Local
Government Development Grant (LGDG) System under which discretionary Council Development Grants
(CDG) and Capacity Building Grants (CBG) are transferred to LGAs which meet good governance related
minimum conditions and performance measures. The World Bank supports the LGDG through the Local
Government Support Project (LGSP). Since 2004 the project has supported the strengthening of fiscal
decentralization, the improvement of accountability in the use of local government resources, and the
management of inter-governmental transfer systems. The share of participating LGAs that meet the
minimum conditions to access the grants has increased from 53.2 percent in FY04/05 to 97.2 percent in
FY09/10.
142. LGSP has made its final contribution to LGDG and a follow-up project is under preparation for FY12.
Despite the increased resource base of LGAs and the functional system of performance-based
intergovernmental transfers, several weaknesses remain. Those include weak capacity in LGAs and the
failure of government to insure timely and reliable transfers, with delays and shortfalls especially high during
the first two quarters of the fiscal year. Inadequate coordination with central ministries often leads to
deficient planning, fund flow analysis, cash management, and reporting, as well as inequitable allocation
among districts. Too many centrally-driven parallel structures with different processes overburden LGAs.
The government has recently set up a working group on LGA planning and reporting and will carry out an
assessment of LGA capacity. The second phase of LGSP will support the mainstreaming of LGDG into the
budget. The World Bank is considering consolidating some of the existing funding mechanisms to the
decentralized level under eight operations into a few multi-sectoral local government baskets, thereby
reducing transaction costs and further promoting alignment to country systems.
143. Concerns over transparency and accountability in the mining sector, including the level of revenues
generated by the sector and captured by the Government (through royalties, taxes, and other fees), prompted
Government to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) as a Candidate Country on
February 16, 2009, and to enact a new Mining Act on May 28, 2010. The process of implementing EITI
includes Tanzania completing validation by May 15, 2011. The validation process, which is currently
underway and will be completed by March 30, 2011, assesses Tanzania's compliance with EITI principles
and standards. To date, Tanzania has made significant progress towards the implementation of EITI
standards, including the launch of the first EITI report reconciling payments made by the extractive
companies and the revenues received by the government for the period of July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009.
Launched in February, the report shows that the government received a total of US$ 99,457,000, while the
extractive companies report they paid a total of US$ 135,504,000, thus resulting in a discrepancy of US$
36,047,000.
144. Tanzania recently improved its ranking in Transparency International’s Global Corruption Perception
Index from 126 in 2009 to 116 in 2010, though its CPI score has only marginally increased from 2.6 in 2009
to 2.7 in 2010.

110

145. Progress towards CAS Outcome 3.2 has been mixed. On the one hand, LGCDG has overall noted
positive progress with the percentage of LGAs meeting the minimum conditions for accessing Capital
Development Grants and Tanzania’s accession to EITI has registered reasonably good progress. On the other
hand, PRAP and ATIP have both registered major implementation issue leading to Marginally Unsatisfactory
ratings and restructuring of both projects. Coupled with the overall high levels of impunity and unethical or
corrupt behavior in the public sector leads to a rating of moderately unsatisfactory for Outcome 3.2.

IV.

Bank Portfolio Performance

IDA Lending
146. The CAS projected new IDA commitments to reach US$2.29 billion over the FY07-FY10 CAS
period. By the end of FY10, actual IDA commitments amounted to US$2.47 billion (see annex 3). The
increase in total commitments was largely due to the record amounts raised for IDA-15 and to Tanzania’s
consistently high CPIA ratings.30 In addition, the CAS period was extended by one year to cover FY11,
during which another US$434 million will be committed for a total of US$2.9 billion over the extended
FY07-FY11 CAS period. The IDA envelope was supplemented with an additional US$110 million from the
Crisis Response Window, committed over FY10 and FY11, bringing the total FY07-FY11 commitments to
over US$3 billion.
147. The PRSCs were reduced from planned disbursements of US$1.14 billion to US$810 million over
the CAS period. Combined with the increase in the overall program, PRSC’s share of overall new lending
declined from the planned 50 percent to 33 percent for the original period of FY07-FY10, or even further to
29 percent of the increased IDA including FY11.
148. 20 projects were planned for delivery during the original CAS period of which 17 were delivered,
and one slipped to FY11. However, 11
Figure 6: Trend of Portfolio Size (FY05-FY10)
new projects, including two regional
projects and six additional financing (of
which one was a PRSC supplemental),
were delivered over the original CAS
period of FY07-FY10, bringing the
total number of projects delivered to 28
projects. In addition, six more projects
(three new plus the PRSC that slipped
from FY10 and two additional
financings) will be delivered in FY11,
bringing the total number of projects
delivered over the extended CAS
period to 34 projects. A number of projects slipped one or two fiscal years.
149. All but two projects originally planned in the CAS program were delivered. Allocations to projects
in the energy, secondary education, transport, communication infrastructure, and mineral sectors were higher

30

Tanzania scored 3.9 in the IDA Resource Allocation Index in 2006 and 2007, and slightly declined to 3.8 in 2008 and
2009, still consistently higher than the IDA borrowers’ average of 3.3.

111

than planned commitments. New projects and additional financing for agriculture, social protection, and
urban services increased the share of those sectors relative to the original program.
150. The total number of projects under implementation during FY07-FY11 averaged 24 projects, with
an average total commitment of US$2.4 billion. World Bank Group disbursements to Tanzania during the
CAS period amounted to US$1.2 billion. In addition, IFC guarantees, loans and equities (disbursed
outstanding) amounted to US$59.6 million.
151. Currently, the project portfolio consists of 23 IDA lending operations, nine regional projects and 15
IFC loans and guarantees. Of the 23 active IDA operations, 13 were approved during FY07-FY11. The total
commitment of active operations is US$2.6 billion, of which US$1.4 billion is undisbursed. According to the
latest ISRs, 13 projects are rated satisfactory for progress towards achievement of development objective, six
projects are rated moderately satisfactory, and three are rated moderately unsatisfactory, while one project is
not yet effective.
152. A total of 16 projects closed from FY07-FY10 (see Annex 6),31 including four PRSCs. In addition,
five more projects have closed or will close in FY11. ICRs were available for ten projects that exited the
portfolio, but only seven of those were reviewed by IEG, see annex 732. IEG rated the outcome of one project
satisfactory (14 percent) , four projects were rated moderately satisfactory (57 percent) , while two projects
were rated moderately unsatisfactory (29 percent) . Borrower performance and quality of Bank supervision
were rated moderately satisfactory or satisfactory. Bank performance and Quality at Entry were similarly
rated, with the exception of the Roads 2 project, where a rating of unsatisfactory for quality at entry reduced
the Bank performance rating to moderately unsatisfactory. The main design flaws identified by IEG included
unrealistic targets, complex structure and failure to consider the low absorption and implementation capacity
of the road sector.
153. The disbursement ratio averaged 24.8 percent over the period FY07-FY10, including a ratio of 34.6
percent in FY10, one of the highest in the region. The disbursement ratio for Tanzania compares well with
the regional average of 23.2 percent over the same period. In a historical perspective, the Bank increased its
gross commitments in Tanzania to an all time high of US$2.85 billion in FY10 (see figure 7). The number of
national operations has remained relatively constant over the past decade, normally ranging from 22 to 26
operations, with the exception of FY01 when only 18 operations were in the active portfolio. This trend
combined with the gradual increase in the total commitments has led to a steady increase in the average
project size from US$51 million in FY01 to US$113 in FY11. Disbursements reached an all time high in
FY10 (US$408 million), though that amount as a share of total commitments was closer to the average over
the past decade.
154. The average age of projects closed during FY07-FY10 was 7 years (excluding PRSCs and GEFs),
compared to the regional average of 5 years. Further, only one of the projects that exited the portfolio
between FY07 and FY10 (excluding PRSCs) did not extend its closing date, reflecting a nearly chronic
underestimation of implementation times.

31

This excludes one GEF project: Eastern Arc Forests (approved FY06, US$ 7 million, closed FY10, fully disbursed)
At the time of CASCR finalization, ICRs were available for Privatization and Private Sector Development (rated
unsatisfactory), Forest Conservation Management (rated moderately unsatisfactory), and Central Transport Corridor
Project (rated moderately satisfactory). A joint ICR will be prepared for the PRSC 4-8 series in FY11.

32

112

155. Project portfolio performance has been satisfactory overall (Annex 5). From FY07 to FY11, four to
12 percent of projects were at risk and 11 projects were rated as problem projects at any time in their lives.
Among the reasons for problem status were slow disbursement, monitoring and evaluation, procurement and
financial management. Most problem projects improve their status quickly due to proactive interventions
from project teams. The restructuring of the Accountability, Transparency and Integrity project was
inadvertently delayed which has reduced Proactivity to 67 percent in FY10 down from 100 percent for the
rest of the CAS period. The (revised) realism index for Tanzania at the end of FY10 was 58.3 percent
compared to the 40.8 percent regional average.
Figure 7: Trend of Disbursement Ratio and Actual Disbursements by Modality

156. M&E issues at national, CAS, and project level. The government designed and implemented a
MKUKUTA/MKUZA Monitoring System as a key tool to increase government accountability and
transparency. The monitoring and evaluation mechanism revolves around three Technical Working Groups
(Surveys and Census, Research and Analysis, and Communications) and the publication of an Annual
Implementation Report to assess progress in the implementation of MKUKUTA/MKUZA. The World Bank
financed an Institutional Development Grant for strengthening the M&E system of MKUKUTA from FY06
through FY09. Due to a series of restructurings and low capacity in the various implementing agencies
responsible for the monitoring system, the grant was underutilized. While data production has significantly
improved over the CAS period, remaining challenges include increased access to data, as well as enhanced
data evaluation as an input to evidence-based decision making. Currently, a new Tanzania Statistical Master
Plan is under development, which is an opportunity to further strengthen statistical production and move
towards greater reliance on country systems and results-based policy making.
157. Tracking progress of MKUKUTA/CAS indicators encountered major challenges, as some
indicators were missing baselines or targets, while data for others was not readily available. With the
CASPR, the results framework was revised, updated and streamlined to improve quality and realism. All
indicators were selected from existing government sources or projects, improving the quality of monitoring,
as well as facilitating attribution to Bank interventions. At the project level, however, monitoring progress on
outputs and outcomes remains a challenge. A monitoring and evaluation assessment was undertaken as part
of the 2009 CPPR and issues highlighted include weak linkages between the activities and outputs of the
projects and their development objective, weak evaluation mechanisms and low utilization of data. The
CPPR action plan included specific M&E actions recommended for each project.

113

158. One Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) took place during the CAS period in April
2009. The country team monitors the portfolio in real time, eliminating the need for frequent CPPRs, and the
Government discourages CPPRs due to the transaction costs they impose. The April 2009 CPPR was
conducted jointly with AfDB and was designed with the aim of reducing transaction costs for both
institutions and the Government. The joint review identified weaknesses of the Bank’s portfolio in Tanzania,
remedies, agencies responsible for actions, and a timeline for implementation. The weaknesses identified
included: (i) delays in fulfillment of loan/grant conditions; (ii) delays in procurement and disbursements; (iii)
poor communication between the Banks and government; (iv) weak implementation capacity; (v) untimely
release of counterpart funds; (vi) irregular submission of project audit reports; (vii) inadequate staffing and
training of fiduciary specialists for the projects; (viii) delays in GoT contributions as well as release of funds
from designated accounts; and (ix) weaknesses in M&E, especially missing baseline and/or targets. The
CPPR emphasized the importance of increased ownership through integration of projects with broader
government programs, use of country systems and implementation arrangements through existing institutions
and procedures. The government was encouraged to adopt a “readiness filter” for future operations, while the
AfDB and World Bank committed to enhancing quality and strengthening results and identified a number of
measures for improving quality of entry, supervision, and exit.
159. Gender Audit. The Gender and Development Group (PRMGE) completes an annual review of the
lending portfolio approved each fiscal year to assess whether projects include (1) gender analysis and
identification of key gender issues, (2) gender actions or actions to ensure women's inclusion in project
benefits, (3) assessment of whether and how the project would contribute to women's empowerment, and (4)
whether the project design included mechanisms to monitor women's participation in project implementation,
its benefits and the project's gender impacts. Between FY08 and FY10, out of the 21 newly approved
projects in Tanzania, 43 percent were considered moderately satisfactory or satisfactory33, according to the
methodology described above. Those projects had some moderately satisfactory gender content, and some
combination of gender sensitive actions, analysis, monitoring & evaluation. The review reveals that the
lending portfolio has improved during the 3 years period, as projects approved in FY10 were more likely to
empower women that those approved in FY08 (56 percent in FY10 - 5 out of 9 projects in total were gender
informed, compared to 17 percent in FY08 - 1 out of 6 projects in total were gender informed).
160. In terms of sector distribution, while in FY08 only one project in the health sector was considered
gender informed, the sector’s performance had improved in FY09 and FY10. In FY10, Agriculture and Rural
Development, Education, Health, Social Protection, and Urban Development sectors had gender-informed
projects. However, projects in Energy, Mining and Telecommunications, Finance and Private Sector
Development, Public Sector, and Transport were still rated unsatisfactory. In FY09, under the WB Gender
Action Plan (GAP), the initiative “Promotion of Women's Entrepreneurship: Tanzania Virtual Business
Incubator” was approved. The pilot aims to contribute to women’s social and economic empowerment; an
Impact evaluation will measure its benefits in 2012.
161. Financial Management. The 2009 CPPR identified a number of cross-cutting issues in financial
management affecting implementation. Those include inadequate financial management staffing and low
familiarity with the fiduciary procedures of development partners, resulting in poor financial reporting.
33

Each project is rated for integration of gender issues on the above mentioned four criteria/dimensions:1) analysis,2)
actions,3) discussion of implications for women’s empowerment, and 4) M&E, on a scale of 1-6, from 1: highly
satisfactory to 6:highly unsatisfactory.

114

Following the CPPR a number of joint fiduciary trainings were organized (FM, Disbursement, and
Procurement) and were well attended by staff at the central level, though capacity at the decentralized level
(LGAs) still needs to be addressed. Disbursement is still slowed down by delays in submission of
disbursement requests or inadequate supporting documents.
162. Procurement. Capacity building and procurement streamlining has significantly progressed. The World
Bank has revised and raised the thresholds for prior review of packages to address the delays in issuance of
no objection. Procurement staff for IDA-financed projects have been encouraged to attend short-term
procurement courses (2-4 weeks), organized by Eastern and Southern Africa Management Institute (ESAMI)
to improve their skills and understanding of policies and procedures. In an effort to professionalize
procurement functions, in December, 2009, the Government established a Public Procurement Policy Unit
(PPPU) within MOFEA, which among other activities will develop and manage the public sector
procurement cadre. The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) conducts regular training sessions
to disseminate provisions of the Procurement Law, regulations and procurement procedures.
163. Safeguards. Over the CAS period, the awareness of environmental and social safeguard policies has
improved though the safeguard capacity in counterpart agencies is still relatively low. The capacity issue is
further exacerbated by lack of appropriate skills, particularly at Local Authority level where responsibilities
for environmental management are delegated to designated officials such as wildlife, forestry and fisheries
officers with limited awareness and scope of issues that need to be covered. Although Government of
Tanzania has enacted an environmental framework law and associated regulations that ensure due diligence
in managing environmental and social impacts, capacity to implement the law remains inadequate.
164. A Field Review of Decentralized Investments (FREDI) was conducted in July 2009 focusing on eight
projects with decentralized components. At the time of the report, the value of decentralized commitments
amounted to 25 percent of the Tanzania portfolio. The report identified a number of project management
issues at both district and community level leading to delays in completion and weak coordination between
different levels. The main issues include difficulty in mobilizing community contributions, weak project
management skills, lack of regular review and proper incentive mechanisms. The review made a number of
recommendations to address not only cross-cutting issues but also project-specific bottlenecks.

IDA Non-Lending
165. Substantial analytical and advisory (AAA) work has been carried out since 2007; many activities in

close collaboration with other DPs (see Annex 4). This work includes a series focusing on constraints to
economic growth and how growth can contribute to a society with less poverty. An extensive number of
short policy notes in specific areas have been produced with the intention to provide key issues, options, and
recommendations in a clear but concise and readable manner, for instance in the cashew, charcoal, and coffee
sectors. The majority of AAA has been carried out under Cluster I, where activities promise greatest benefits
to the economy in the short to medium term. At the same time AAA has addressed cross-sectoral issues such
as national poverty assessments and PEFAR. Finally, the Bank’s AAA has contributed substantially to
addressing recent corruption cases by strengthening of the Controller Auditor General’s office and policy
dialogue in connection with triggers for the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) series.

115

Trust Funds
166. Over the CAS period, the Tanzania program included disbursements from 44 trust funds, providing
more that USD 93 million in grants (see annex 8 for more detail). More than half of the trust funds were
Bank executed, but in terms of volume, over 80 percent of the trust fund commitments and disbursements
were recipient executed. The majority of trust funds were closely linked to lending operations and thus
aligned with the Government’s priorities.
167. Trust funds focused mainly on: i. environment and sustainable energy (GEF); ii. community-based cash
transfers; iii. support to Poverty Reduction Support Credits; iv. capacity building for M&E of MKUKUTA,
legal literacy, and distance learning centers. Trust funds also contributed to the completion of various AAA
during the CAS period, including the Poverty Assessment, the Shared Growth policy notes, and a TASAF
Impact Evaluation report.
168. Projects that integrated major trust funds in design and implementation include LVEMP, Eastern Arc
Forest Conservation and Management, Marine and Coastal Environmental Management, Private Sector
Competitiveness, Energy Development and Access Expansion, and Lower Kihansi Gorge Ecosystem.
Looking forward, the new CAS should ensure that trust funds are integrated in the strategic framework,
including the results framework, for Bank assistance to the country, both on the lending and the non-lending
side.

Regional Projects
169. Growing regional initiatives and commitment have increased the number and volume of regional
projects for Tanzania (see Annex 9). Government has shown increased interest in regional projects,
recognizing the potential benefits such as network effects from infrastructure programs and positive
externalities from environmental initiatives. In 2007, there were only six regional projects involving
Tanzania with a total commitment of US$68.9 million specifically for Tanzania. By end-FY10, the number
had grown to eleven projects with Tanzanian commitments of US$214 million (equivalent to about 9 percent
of the country portfolio).34 Since two-thirds of regional projects or components are financed through a
separate regional IDA envelope, regional financing potentially has a substantial impact on resource
availability for Tanzania.
170. The regional integration agenda is supported largely through projects for trade facilitation, transport,
energy, and communication networks. The efforts to create a stronger EAC are supported through the East
Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation Project and the Regional Trade Facilitation Project. In addition,
several studies have been undertaken in support of Tanzania’s efforts to further regional integration. These
include how to build Tanzania as a regional trade hub, a strategic plan for Export Processing Zones in
Tanzania, and a study on non-tariff measures on goods in EAC. A follow up to the latter is planned for FY11
in combination with a study on professional services. Lastly, IFC and Foreign Investment Advisory Services
(FIAS) have provided analysis of the regulatory framework for Special Economic Zones in an effort to assist
harmonization of regulatory frameworks across the member countries of EAC.

34

There are currently 9 regional operations with Tanzania commitments of US$204 million.

116

MIGA, IFC and WBI
171. Over the CAS period IFC’s strategy in Tanzania focused on strengthening financial markets,
particularly access to finance for MSMEs, improving infrastructure by providing long-term financing for
large infrastructure projects, and developing competitive high growth firms in agribusiness and tourism.
IFC’s portfolio has significantly increased from US$35 million in February 2007 to US$113.9 million in
June, 2010, as it has taken advantage of investment opportunities across sectors. IFC has forged partnerships
with local banks to foster joint ventures aimed at supporting its operations with local currency financing. The
Africa Micro, Small and Medium Term Enterprise program (AMSME) assists the Diamond Trust Bank of
Tanzania in increasing its lending to SMEs through redesigning its products and procedures. The Credit
Reference Bureau program provides advisory services to the BoT for the implementation, licensing, and
monitoring of bureaus and the implementation of a credit reporting system. Other innovative projects in SME
that IFC has developed include a Trade Finance Facility at Exim Bank, a credit line with Exim Bank to
support women entrepreneurs, a loan and equity investment in Access Bank, a microfinance institution. The
recently closed SECO/IFC Leasing program has contributed substantially to the development of the leasing
sector, especially by giving SME owners the opportunity to acquire equipment without much up front capital
outlay.
172. Energy and transport infrastructure are among the long-standing constraints impeding faster private
sector development. The infrastructure sector is dominated by large public enterprises such as TANESCO,
TRL, or DAWASCO. IFC has been exploring private sector participation in utilities and parastatals, and is
interested in providing finance to Independent Power Producer projects in the country. However, IFC’s
largest loan (US$44 million) to the Tanzanian Railway Limited has been unsuccessful. After multiple
implementation difficulties, and failed efforts to restructure the project, the GoT and the operator (RITES)
have decided to re-nationalize the TRL, and IFC has already received its first prepayment from TRL.

Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination
173. To assist Tanzania in reaching its development goals, the Bank coordinates with development partners
and participates in joint dialogue with the Government. Tanzania has an elaborate dialogue structure agreed
between the Government and DPs, and the Bank has been a very active player in the Development Partner
Group (DPG) and many of the 25 sector or thematic Working Groups. In 2009-2010, Government and DPs
undertook extensive consultations on the Division of Labor (DoL) to improve coordination and policy
dialogue. Most major sectors and reform programs undertake joint annual reviews preceding the GBS annual
review, and formally adopt or strive toward Sector-wide Approaches (SWAps). Currently, eight Bank
projects channel funds through nine Basket Funding mechanisms to support common programs jointly with
other DPs.35 From FY07 to FY10, 45 percent of total actual disbursement from the country portfolio was
made in the form of budget support (PRSCs or other DPL), with the rest through Basket Funding or project
financing. Implementation arrangements for the Bank-financed operations are increasingly mainstreamed and

35

Sectors/programs in which the Bank channels funds through Basket Fund mechanism with other DPs include:
agriculture; business environment; financial sector; heath; legal sector reform; public financial management; public
sector reform; tax modernization; and water and sanitation.

117

aligned to the country’s institutions and systems; the default mode is to use existing institutional structures
without creating Project Implementation Units.36
174. While the formal dialogue structure has developed substantially over the CAS period it is not clear
whether the quality of dialogue has made similar improvements. Task Team Leaders note a tendency to onesided dialogue in the cluster working groups where government representative often lack capacity or
mandate to make interventions and commit to agreements on behalf of government. This delays
implementation of decisions and contributes to a perception of defensiveness on government’s part, when the
annual reviews find lack of progress in the related sectors. While ability or mandate is low, government
representative show a lot of interest in ownership of the development dialogue. This is welcome but the
abovementioned limitations in government participation in the dialogue translate into inadequate awareness
of what to do and reluctance to admit shortcomings.

V.

Lessons Learned and Suggestions for the Next CAS

175. The Completion Report of the 2007-2011 Tanzania CAS contains lessons for the country’s next CAS
and for the Bank’s work in low income countries.
General Lessons and Issues to be Addressed
176. General budget support was projected to be the principal instrument during the 2007-2011 CAS
period. However, over the CAS period government’s commitment to policy reform slowed significantly,
which compromised the performance of a number of reform programs, and actual outcomes fell short of
expected results. In a slow policy reform environment, the size and scope of PRSCs should be revisited in
favor of interventions in areas with high impact and strong government commitment.
177. The original CAS Results Matrix was overambitious in trying to align CAS results with
MKUKUTA goals, making attribution of development outcomes a challenge. The CAS mid-term review
(CASPR) appropriately reduced the number of outcomes and milestones in an attempt to make them more
realistic and better aligned with Bank interventions. However, the overall development outcomes remain
mixed; a number of Bank projects during the CAS period did not deliver their expected results due to an
overestimation of Government’s implementation capacities. A careful assessment of the Bank’s comparative
advantage in program design and supervision should guide the formulation of the next CAS. More realism,
candor, and less complex design are instrumental for ensuring successful outcomes under the next CAS.
178. Efforts to improve Government’s implementation capacity were not always successful. The
traditional approach of building institutions and capacity did not always work, for example the expansion of
decentralized MDAs did not improve service efficiency and public financial management. Reform by doing
less might yield more, for example through selective focus on how Government can remove costly obstacles
to private investment.
179. The development of the 2007 Joint Assistance Strategy (JAST) did not reduce transaction costs as
intended. Rather than elaborating a joint strategy, Development Partners and the Government should focus
on on-the-ground operational mechanisms for aid effectiveness. The General Budget Support Framework is
36

A Client Survey was done in the fall of 2010 and its results are given in the FY12-15 Tanzania CAS, which will be
presented to the Board in FY11.

118

aligned with the MKUKUTA and is a strong mechanism for coordination and harmonization among
development partners.
180. The CASCR and CASPR have identified major shortcomings in M&E as MKUKUTA and CAS
indicators were missing baselines, targets, and progress data. With the CASPR, results indicators were
selected from existing government sources or Bank projects to improve the quality of monitoring. However,
the government’s weak statistical capacity made it difficult to track progress on MKUKUTA indicators. The
Bank should contribute to improving the government’s statistical capacity given its importance for evidencebased decision making. In addition, at the World Bank project level monitoring progress on outputs and
outcomes remains a challenge. Although the importance of M&E has been highlighted since 2007, this
CASCR has identified operations in sectors such as agriculture, social protection, and the environment,
where there is no adequate data to fully evaluate progress.
181. AAA has been particularly effective when it has been linked to investment operations. An example
of a successful combination of interventions (AAA, IL, and policy dialogue through DPL) is electricity
tariffs. The Bank has managed to convince government of the need for higher tariffs through a mix of
incentives (GBS and IL) and information (AAA). This approach should be continued under the next CAS
and could be extended to other sectors such as secondary education and higher education, water supply and
sanitation, land titling, and upgrade of port and railway infrastructure.
182. The JAST focused on broad-based governance reform programs, which did not progress as
rapidly as desired. Greater attention should be given to strengthening governance at the level of service
delivery through local government and sector-specific support. In addition, the Bank’s program could
support the demand for good governance more systematically, including through use of ICT.
Sector Specific Lessons and Issues to be Addressed
183. Bank financing in education should give performance incentives for better outcomes. The primary
and secondary education agendas should focus more on the quality of education and learning outcomes and
less on construction of new buildings. A greater focus on quality education can be achieved by introducing
incentives to students (such as payments for completing primary and secondary school), to teachers
(payments to work in remote areas) and by promoting competition from private secondary schools through a
voucher program.
184. Efforts to promote private investment in large infrastructure have been generally unsatisfactory,
such as the TANESCO management contract to the DAWASCO/DAWASA water supply concession,
the TRL railway concession, and the ATCL airline privatization. These failures have both technical
causes (poor contract preparation; wrong incentives for better private management; unclear agreements about
investment plans) and political ones, notably the reluctance of the state to surrender control. The Bank’s role
in promoting future private infrastructure investments should be to finance complementary public
investments, improve regulation, and advise on structured finance.
