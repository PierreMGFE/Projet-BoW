REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA - COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.

As Moldova approaches middle-income status, the country needs a
sustainable growth strategy, recognizing that it i s unlikely that remittance flowswhich have fueled consumption-led growth the last few years-will continue to grow
very rapidly. Although migration and remittances will likely be key drivers o f growth
and development over the CPS period and for some time to come, Moldova needs to
create the conditions for remittances to be used as productively as possible, such as
through strengthening financial intermediation and improvements in the business
environment, to allow Moldova to increase private savings and investment.

..

This results-based Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) aims to assist in
laying the foundations for inclusive economic growth in Moldova. This will require
addressing three interrelated challenges: (i)improving economic competitiveness to
support sustainable economic growth; (ii)minimizing social and environmental risks,
building human capital, and promoting social inclusion; and (iii)
improving public sector
governance. These three areas constitute the three pillars o f this CPS for FY09-FY12 and
are consistent with the Government o f Moldova’s National Development Strategy (NDS)
2008-201 1.
11.

iii.

Moldova’s macroeconomic performance under the past Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) has been robust. The authorities have established a good track record o f
macroeconomic stability, with cumulative growth over 2004-2007 o f about 25 percent.
The economy has been resilient to a number o f external shocks, including sharp increases
in natural gas prices, a Russian ban on importing wine from Moldova, and a drought in
2007 that reduced agricultural production by an estimated 30 percent.

iv.
The last CAS period has been characterized by political stability, with
increasing political pluralism and a competitive electoral process. The current
President, a member o f the Party o f Communists o f the Republic o f Moldova (PCRM),
will complete the maximum two terms in 2009. The Transnistria conflict has continued to
weigh on the country’s development, but reunification is a high priority o f Moldova’s
NDS, and continued efforts towards a resolution are expected given its importance for
both economic growth and European integration.
v.
Moldova aspires to join the European Union over the longer term, and the
country has been receiving increasing and more coordinated financing from
European institutions. In 2007, the EU arrived at Moldova’s border with the accession
o f Romania. In 2008, due to the successful implementation o f the EU-Moldova Action
Plan, autonomous trade preferences went into effect, and discussions are now underway
on a new legal agreement with the EU.
vi.
Despite the ongoing economic growth and political stability, the reduction in
overall poverty appears to have stalled, at least between 2004 and 2005. Recently
released numbers from the Government suggest that the absolute poverty rate and the
extreme poverty rate have fallen to 25.8 per cent and 2.8 percent, respectively in 2007. A
more systematic assessment led by the Poverty Assessment team i s now underway o f the
vii

drivers o f these recent developments. Moldova’s economic recovery moved 40 percent
o f the population out o f poverty between 1999 and 2004; however, the delay in
restructuring farms has reduced the income-generating opportunities for individual
farmers and contributed to rising rural poverty at least through 2005. The analysis o f the
trends after 2005 i s constrained by a statistical break in the series.
vii.
T h e Moldovan economy remains vulnerable. The large inflow o f remittances
has underpinnedrecent consumption-led growth but also exposes the economy to risks o f
a regional downturn. Already there are signs that migration might have slowed and some
workers might have returned. Ongoing increases iu natural gas prices necessitate
adjustments in an economy that i s s t i l l inefficient in i t s energy use. The sharp rise in food
prices and the global financial crisis are potential risks which could negatively impact the
economy. Future weather-related events pose a continuing risk to the agricultural sector.
Flexibility will b e central to the W o r l d Bank Group’s approach to allow for
viii.
adaptation to changing economic and political contexts. Since Moldova’s per capita
income recently exceeded the IDA threshold, the country i s entering a transition periodpossibly moving to lending from the IBRD. The Bank’s country program will therefore
adjust the use o f instruments as appropriate, likely investing less in projects and more in
analytic and advisory activities over time as would befit a middle income country.
Following Parliamentary elections, the designation o f a new government i s expected in
mid-2009, and collaboration with the new government could warrant some changes.

ix.
This C P S therefore reflects a strategic transition f r o m the previous C A S
through a two-step process. The first stage involves scaling up interventions and
programs that are working well within the existing portfolio during FY09 and FYlO.
During the second stage, interventions will be defined in more specific terms for the
remaining years o f the CPS period. This approach allows the Bank some flexibility to
adjust the portfolio as needed in response to issues emerging after the upcoming elections
or as a result o f a regional financial crisis. Second-stage interventions w i l l be clearly
described in the CPS Progress Report, and the timing o f this report w i l l be advanced if
appropriate to ensure that refinements to the country program are timely and effective.
x.
T h e C P S foresees a lending program o f two to three operations p e r year-at
least one o f which would b e budget support. Commitments will total approximately
US$45-$50 million per annum, with the specific country allocation being determined
annually through IDA’S performance-based allocation system. The Bank w i l l consider
additional financing to existing operations within the current portfolio and support for
projects with regional or global goods components. Investment operations w i l l build on
the Bank’s track record and comparative advantage vis-a-vis other partners and focus in
those areas where other funding can be highly leveraged.
M o l d o v a i s a strategic priority for IFC, and IFC w i l l increase i t s investment
xi.
activities and advisory services in the country. IFC’s main goal i s to support private
sector development, focusing in particular on the financial sector, agribusiness,
healthcare, and infrastructure modernization. IFC will collaborate closely with I D A
especially in the infrastructure and health sectors.

...

Vlll

\

xii.
The Bank’s work on governance and anti-corruption will be consistent with
the Bank’s recently approved corporate strategy. Country ownership and leadership i s
required for the Bank’s program to make a decisive difference during the CPS period and
improve Moldova’s standing on various comparative governance measures. The Bank

will also work with other stakeholders, civil society and the private sector to ensure
reform efforts by the authorities are supported and deepened by greater demand for good
governance.
xiii.
Effective implementation o f this CPS will require strong coordination with
other development efforts, and monitoring and evaluation activities will capitalize
on opportunities for increased harmonization. Indicators from the NDS have been
incorporated into the results framework where appropriate and the Bank will rely on
country data systems and unified reporting systems where feasible. The Bank will
monitor fiduciary risks, implementation capacity at the central and decentralized levels,
external shocks, and political economy risks.
xiv.

The Executive Directors may wish to consider the following:
Whether the lessons learned from the previous CAS period have been
sufficiently reflected in the CPS;
Whether the CPS has identified the relevant development challenges and
whether the pillars o f support under the new program provide the appropriate
response;
Whether the CPS sufficiently supports the Paris and Accra Declarations for
the streamlining o f development assistance;
Whether the risks identified by the program are realistic and whether the
proposed remedies are credible; and
Whether the program makes optimal use o f the resources available to the
World Bank Group in order to respond to Moldova’s needs.

ix

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A.

Political Context

1.
During the last CAS period (FY05 to FYOS), Moldova experienced political
stability, with increasing political pluralism and a competitive electoral process. The
Party o f Communists o f the Republic o f Moldova (PCRM) won a majority o f the
Parliament’s seats in the 2001 election, and Parliament, in turn, elected a communist
President. The PCRM majority and President remained in power after the next round o f
scheduled elections in 2005-seen as free and fair by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and others. The Prime Minister appointed in 2001 served
for seven years. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for 2009, at which time the
incumbent president i s expected to stand down having served the maximum two terms. In
2007, opposition parties took over a number o f regional assemblies from the PCRM,
demonstrating that the local elections offered genuine choice. In addition, the number o f
women elected as mayors has grown from 16 percent (2003) to 19 percent (2007), and in
2008, a woman was appointed as Prime Minister o f Moldova for the first time.
2.
Despite this stability and progress, the Transnistria conflict has continued to
weigh on the country’s overall development. Relations between the two sides have been
tense since Transnistria declared independence from Moldova in 1990. Because this eastern
territory contained a significant part o f Moldova’s industrial base, this conflict has forced
Moldova to be even more dependent on agricultural production and imported energy. It
also created a fractured customs space with implications for customs and tax revenue
mobilization. Following a brief conflict in 1992, a ceasefire has been in place; however,
efforts to forge a permanent settlement under the auspices o f a multi-country group have
made little headway in recent years. Direct dialogue between Chisinau and Tiraspol
occurred in April 2008, and continued efforts towards a resolution are expected using the
5+2 format-with the main participants including the central government in Chisinau,
Transnistria, OSCE, Ukraine, and Russia, and the two observers including the EU and U.S.
Reunification i s a high priority o f Moldova’s National Development Strategy (NDS) given
i t s importance for both economic growth and European integration.
3.
I n the international arena, Moldova aspires to join the European Union over
the longer term. Moldova has strengthened i t s relations with the EU, and both parties
agreed to objectives specified in a three-year EU-Moldova Action Plan (EMAP) signed in
2005 within the framework o f the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP). In 2006, the
European Commission (EC) established a delegation in Chisinau. As o f January 1, 2007,
the EU has arrived at Moldova’s border with the accession o f Romania. In 2008, due to the
successful implementation o f the EU-Moldova Action Plan, autonomous trade preferences
went into effect for Moldova, providing for the duty free access o f Moldovan products to
the markets o f EU countries.

4.
Moldova has been receiving increasing and more coordinated financing from
European institutions. EU support in Moldova has been directed in particular at building
capacity in public administration, reforming social assistance and primary health care,
developing a reform strategy in the energy sector, improving the business climate,
especially export capacity, and improving the r u l e o f law, the independence o f the

1

judiciary, and respect for human rights. Joint Moldova-EU efforts have also focused on
border management and confidence-building measures for Transnistria. Moldova has
recently become the first ENP country to sign on June 5, 2008 a Pilot Mobility Partnership
to strengthenthe country’s capacity for migration management.

5.
Discussions are underway on a new legal agreement with the EU. The Council
o f the EU has noted positive achievements in the process o f political and economic reforms
under the first EMAP and welcomed Moldova’s active alignment with the Common
Foreign and Security Policy Declarations. Important progress has been achieved in
facilitating visa procedures while controlling illegal migration and in increasing trade
access to the European market. The Council has highlighted those areas where ongoing
efforts must be prioritized to strengthen democracy and the r u l e o f law, ensure respect for
human rights, reinforce efforts against corruption, and improve the investment climate.
Moldova has demonstrated the stability and capacity to implement a broad
6.
range of economic development initiatives, but much remains to be done to sustain
economic growth and poverty reduction. With a population o f about 3.8 million and a
Gross National Income (GNI) per capita o f approximately $1,090 in 2007, Moldova
remains a relatively low-income country. Those who are actively engaged in the political
process remain relatively few-largely because the middle class i s still small, civil society
i s fragmented, and many youth are emigrating. Moving forward, Moldova must consolidate
the results from structural reforms needed to establish vital policies and institutions, and
accelerate the second generation o f reforms to provide long-term opportunities to young
Moldovans.

B.

Recent Economic Developments

7.
Moldova’s macroeconomic performance under the past CAS has been robust.
The authorities have established a good track record o f macroeconomic stability, with
cumulative growth over 2004-2007 o f about 25 percent. The Government has maintained a
prudent fiscal stance, recording small primary surpluses in most years. Inflation has been
the main macroeconomic challenge in recent years, and with the support from an
International Monetary Fund Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF), the Government
has pursued a tight monetary and fiscal policy stance. However, in the wake o f recent
global economic turbulence, a growth slowdown i s emerging as the new macroeconomic
challenge for Moldova. Overall, the macroeconomic framework currently in place i s
broadly satisfactory (Table 1).
8.
The economy has been resilient to a number of recent external shocks. In 2006,
Russia banned the import o f wine from Moldova, which accounted for about a quarter o f
all Moldovan exports and 10 percent o f GDP. Meanwhile, Moldova, a net importer o f
energy, also confronted sharp increases in natural gas prices, which tripled from January
2006 to July 2008. In the summer o f 2007, the agricultural sector, directly representing
about 14 percent o f GDP, was severely affected by a drought with losses in the sector
estimated at nearly 30 percent o f production. Moldova’s economic growth fell to about 4
percent in 2006 and more moderate growth persisted through 2007, reflecting the impact o f
the drought. Despite weaker than expected overall performance, growth in non-agriculture
GDP continues to be strong at 9 percent last year. Through the first half o f 2008, growth

2

has rebounded strongly, and the economy i s projected to expand by 6.5 percent in 2008.

9.
There have been encouraging signs that Moldova’s previous model o f
consumption-driven growth may be broadening, with other drivers o f growth
increasingly playing a more prominent role. Since the beginning o f the recovery in 2000,
economic growth has averaged 5.5 percent per year and has been driven in large part by
consumption and construction activities supported by massive inflows o f workers’
remittances (amounting to about a third o f GDP in 2008). There i s some evidence that
remittances are increasingly flowing to business investment activities rather than
consumption and housing construction alone. Private investment has risen from about 14
percent o f GDP in 2003 to 3 1 percent o f GDP in 2007, and foreign direct investment (FDI)
flows have grown sharply over this same period. FDI represented about 10 percent o f GDP
in 2007, much higher than that o f other countries in the region (though cumulatively and in
per capita terms, Moldova s t i l l lags well behind i t s neighbors). Public investment has also
generally increased in recent years.
10.
The global economic crisis has significantly clouded Moldova’s economic
outlook. Moldova could be severely affected by a slowdown in remittances inflows and
F D I in the wake o f a regional recession. The current account deficit has widened in recent
years (from 10 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 17 percent in 2007), as a result o f higher energy
prices, the ban on Moldovan wine exports, strong remittance-driven import demand and
increased FDI-related activities. As a result o f the expected regional slowdown, Moldova’s
current account deficit i s projected to widen further in 2008 to around 19 percent o f GDP.
Overall coverage o f the current account deficit by FDI and long-term capital remains high
at about 90 percent. Reserves have been rising, suggesting that total capital flows have
been more than sufficient to finance the current account deficit, leading to an accumulation
o f reserves (from 2.2 months o f imports in 2005 to nearly 3.3 months projected in 2008).
11.

Despite recent global financial turbulence, Moldova’s own financial sector

3

appears to be well positioned to weather the impact o f the ongoing crises in world
financial markets. The high degrees o f capitalization and liquidity as well as reasonably
good asset structures provide a sizeable cushion against potential systemic shocks. The
Government’s commitment to a flexible exchange rate regime will help soften the impact
o f external shocks. Nonetheless, the growth outlook for 2009 i s uncertain at best. (In
December, 2008, the IMF projected a 2009 growth rate o f 3.5 percent.) The expected real
appreciation o f the exchange rate also creates pressures on the economy that will need to be
addressed by policies to support further improvements in productivity and competitiveness.

C.

Macroeconomic Prospects and Debt Sustainability

12.
The Moldovan economy remains vulnerable. Four areas in particular present
continuing risks:
Global uncertainties. Although estimates to date suggest a strong rebound o f the
Moldovan economy following last year’s agricultural-driven slowdown, the recent
global financial shocks could negatively impact Moldova, including through a growth
slowdown among i t s main trading partners and among the host countries o f Moldova’s
migrant workers. The heavy reliance on remittances exposes the economy to risks o f an
external downturn. These risks are compounded by the lack o f product and market
diversification in trade flows. However, remittance and FDI-driven imports are likely
to slow down as well, thus mitigating the net impact on the balance o f payments.
Energy prices. As per the agreement reached with Gazprom, energy prices will
continue to increase until they reach market (i.e. EU) levels by 201 1. In July 2008, the
price reached US$253 per mcm, which compares to US$SO per m c m in December
2005. Declining o i l prices in the latter half o f 2008 as well as an appreciating exchange
rate could help moderate the expected increase in domestic natural gas prices.
Nonetheless, the price Moldova pays for natural gas i s expected to increase further
relative to i t s current level. This will force further adjustments in an economy that i s
s t i l l inefficient in its energy use, and the impact will fall disproportionately on the poor.
Foodprices. The impact o f rising global food prices i s likely to affect negatively the
urban poor, who do not produce their own food. Also, insofar as government policy
discriminates against net food producers, higher costs could undermine agricultural
development. The sharp rise in food prices has fueled inflation through the first part o f
2008. The rebound in the domestic agricultural sector has contributed to a slowdown in
food price inflation since then, along with falling global food prices.
Climate change. The 2007 drought will have persistent effects on the agriculture sector.
The impact o f 2008 flooding i s not yet clear. Future weather-related events pose a
continuing risk to the sector and, hence, overall economic growth and price stability.

The debt outlook i s favorable with a low risk o f debt distress. Moldova’s ratio o f
13.
total external debt to GDP declined from about 124 percent in 2000 to around 54.1 percent
in 2007. External public and publicly-guaranteed debt excluding debt o f state-owned
enterprises f e l l from 6 1.5 percent o f GDP in 200 1 to around 20 percent o f GDP at the end
o f 2007. According to a recent Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted jointly by
the IMF and the World Bank, the public debt and debt-service to revenue ratios are well
within the relevant thresholds in the baseline and “historical” scenarios (Table 2). Despite

4

severe external shocks, the Moldovan authorities have maintained a prudent fiscal policy
stance, which combined with strong economic growth has led to steady improvements in
the debt situation. In addition, there are encouraging medium-term prospects for official
donor assistance, mainly due to commitments (largely in the form o f grants) by donors at
the Consultative Group meeting in 2006, thus boosting Moldova’s debt sustainability
further.

14.
Moldova’s borrowing in the near term i s forecast to b e largely on concessional
terms, but external debt i s likely to become less concessional over the longer term.
With steady economic growth, Moldova’s GNI per capita income (US$1,090 in 2007)
recently exceeded the International Development Association (IDA) threshold o f
The possible transition to lending from the International Bank for
US$1,065.’
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) will carry important policy implications for
Moldova to manage external debt effectively while addressing public investment needs. O f
particular urgency i s the need to invest in critical infrastructure and state assets-such as
roads, hospitals, and schools-without threatening debt sustainability or increasing public
revenues.

n o w quite high relative to other countries given Moldova’s income level and institutional
development. The creation o f fiscal space by further increases in revenue mobilization i s
not a desirable option given that revenues are already 8 percentage points o f GDP higher
than the average o f countries o f similar income levels. T o accelerate growth, Moldova will
need to focus reform efforts on increasing the efficiency o f public resource use to yield
increased space for public investment spending while leaving room for the private sector.
In addition, specific reforms to reduce the civil service will need to be developed and
implemented in the near term. Public expenditures are currently projected to remain steady
in percent o f GDP through 2009.

D. Poverty Profile
16.
Moldova’s economic recovery moved 40 percent o f the population out of
poverty between 1999 and 2004 (Figure 1). This poverty reduction was broad-based and
represents the largest decline (in percentage terms) among countries in the Europe and
Central Asia (ECA) region over this period. However, the reduction in overall poverty
stalled between 2004 and 2005 owing to an increase in rural poverty (Table 3). Due to
distortions and imperfections in agricultural output and input markets, agricultural
producers are receiving less for their outputs and paying more for their inputs relative to
international parity prices than they should.

Methodological improvements in the Household Budget Survey (HBS) prevent
direct comparisons between data from 2006 and those of previous years. Some effort i s
n o w underway to create a comparable series between 2005 and 2006 using recently
developed statistical techniques (Box 1). The data for 2006 and 2007 are, in principle,
comparable. The preliminary poverty headcount for 2007 for Moldova as a whole was
recently made available (Figure 1 and Table 3) and these data suggest that poverty may

6

have fallen between 2006 and 2007 (Figure 1
and Box l).3
A more systematic assessment
o f this trend i s underway.

Box 1. The 2006 Revisions to the Household
Budget Survey
The sampling frame, sampling methodology and
the questionnaire of the HBS, the main source o f
data for measuring living standards, were all
substantially revised in 2006 to make the survey
more representative and improve the
measurement o f consumption. These
methodological improvements prevent the
analysis of poverty trends through 2006. The lack
of comparability could be addressed in part by
applying some new methods recently developed
by World Bank staff, the so-called Small Area
Estimates (SAE). The aim i s to predict household
per capita consumption in a later round based on
a model of consumption estimated using an
earlier round, to ensure that the definition o f
consumption i s the same across two, otherwise
incomparable, surveys. Preliminary work has
been initiated to apply the same methodology to
the 2005 and 2006 surveys. The initial results
suggest that poverty may have fallen somewhat
over this period, but this requires further and
more systematic verification.

18.
T h e welfare consequences o f recent
economic shocks are not yet well
understood. The recent drought, wine ban,
and the continued rise in food and energy
prices could have significant poverty
implications. For example, the relative food
scarcity in the country has led to a marked
spike in food inflation, which i s currently the
main contributing source to the Consumer
Price Index inflation. Year-on-year food price
inflation i s estimated to have risen to 24
percent in M a y 2008, with bread, fi-uit, and
milk prices rising by 20, 56, and 24 percent
respectively. For this same period last year,
food price inflation was about 5 percent. A
recent policy note on food price increases in
E C A simulated the likely poverty impact o f
rising grain prices in the region and suggested Source: Ferre, Celine, 2008 “Updating Poverty

Moreover, spendin? on food represents close to 60 percent o f the expenditures o f the
poorest households -underscoring that the welfare impact o f food price increases could be
significant.

Poverty in Moldova s t i l l remains very much a rural phenomenon.
Notwithstanding the technical issues o f comparability o f HBS data over time, the
government’s latest Poverty Measurement Note suggests a poverty profile that i s broadly
consistent with the World Bank’s previous Poverty Assessments. About a quarter o f the
population i s poor and about 70 percent o f the poor live in rural areas, according to the
2007 HBS. The urban poverty headcount i s 14 percent while the rural poverty headcount i s
31.3 percent.6 Consistent with previous findings, many o f the poor are among pensioners,
farmers and agricultural workers. Poverty among farmers reflects limited economic
opportunities in rural areas and in the agriculture sector. In addition, poverty levels rise
with the size o f the household (number o f household members), particularly those with
young children. In fact, child poverty i s higher than adult poverty: in 2006, child poverty
stood at 27.4 percent compared with 25.8’ percent for adults.

E.

Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals

20.
Moldova i s working to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
and has adapted targets and indicators based on the national context. In 2000, the
Republic o f Moldova along with other 191 countries o f the world committed to achieving
the MDGs by 2015. The first adjustment o f these goals to fit Moldova’s situation was done
in 2004 and resulted in a number o f specific targets and indicators which have been further
refined in the following years. Reaching these targets i s part o f the medium- and long-term
strategy o f government as articulated in the 2008-20 11 National Development Strategy.
Moldova has made some progress towards achieving the MDGs, and targets for 20 10 and
2015 were revised during the NDS consultation process with both central public authorities
and a number o f national and international organizations (Table 4). The full l i s t o f adjusted
national target MDGs are presented in Annex 1.
21.
Moldova has made significant progress in achieving Goal 1-eradicating
extreme poverty and hunger. Given the recent improvements to the methodology for the
Household Budget Survey, a new baseline has been established for poverty reduction in
2006, and further progress i s expected to reach the 2010 and 2015 targets. Good progress
has also been made toward implementation o f measures seeking to reduce child and
maternal mortality rates. The under-5 mortality rate (per 1000 live born) f e l l from 18.2 in
2002 to 14.0 in 2006, and the maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live born) dropped from
28.0 in 2002 to 16.0 in 2006. Changes in methodology have resulted in new baselines being
set for both indicators, and Moldova expects to achieve the new targets set for 2010 and
2015.7

6

The 2006 urban poverty rate i s much higher than that o f previous years. This could be due to
methodological changes, but could also be due to energy price increases. Increases in energy prices are likely
to have affected mostly urban households connected to energy sources. The rural poor, in contrast, were
likely to have greater access to cheaper, and dirtier, sources o f fuel.
7
The Ministry o f Health i s applying a new methodology recommendedby the World Health Organization
wherein a live birth i s defined as a birth after 22 complete weeks o f pregnancy and a child weight above 500
grams. Previously, a birth was considered live after the 30* complete week o f pregnancy and a child weight
above 1,000 grams.

Achieving the objective on HIV/AIDS remains a serious challenge despite
strong policy efforts. Policies related to curbing the spread o f H I V / A I D S have been
formulated in the National Programme on Prevention and Control o f HIV/AIDS and
Sexually Transmitted Infections for 2006-20 10, which was approved by the Government in
2005. The National Programme includes a broad set o f measures on preventing the spread
o f the infection with special attention to children and youth, effective surveillance o f the
epidemiological situation, development o f testing systems, and medical and social care o f
people living with HIV/AIDS. To date, Moldova’s response to H I V / A I D S has been
exemplary in comparison to that o f other countries in the E C A region. The World Bank has
recently developed a tool based on existing indicators and data sources to measure
countries’ responses to the epidemic. A benchmarking study using this tool-the
Composite HIV/AIDS Response Index-indicated that Moldova was the top performer
among 14 E C A countries. Moldova’s policies were particularly effective for treatment and

9

national programs and less so for prevention.’

F.

Governance and Anticorruption

23.
The quality of governance in Moldova remains a significant challenge to
economic growth and poverty reduction. An unfavorable external environment
characterized by frozen conflict, recurrent external shocks, and a delicate two-vector
geopolitical balance between the EU and Russia exacerbate this challenge. The picture that
emerges from the extensive analytical and diagnostic work conducted by the Bank and
other donors reveals significant governance obstacles and limited prospects for quick wins.
The main crosscutting issues related to governance in Moldova are described below; the
specific sectoral obstacles and their relevance for development are covered through this
CPS document. A detailed analysis o f Moldova’s governance and anti-corruption,
including fiduciary and country systems and Country Governance and Anti-Corruption
(CGAC) strategy appears in Annex 2.

24.
Moldova’s success in addressing corruption has been uneven. Compared to a
sample o f former Soviet Union (FSU) countries, Moldova performs better or i s on par on
several performance indicators. (Annex 2, Figure 1). However, Moldova remains an outlier
on “unofficial” payments for civil courts, public education, and public health. One-third o f
the population believes that corruption has increased under this government. The same
survey found that 70 percent o f the population view corruption as widespread; 78 percent
believed that corruption had recently worsened in Moldova, and 64 percent indicated that
corruption was “normal and inevitable.” Institutions perceived to be the most corrupt
included the police, customs, judiciary, prosecutors, and ministries while the least corrupt
were the National Statistics Office, mayoralties, military, and local councils.
The institutional structure lacks sufficient checks and balances. Moldova i s
25.
constitutionally a parliamentary democracy, in which the President i s elected by
parliament. However, political power has remained concentrated in the Presidency,
facilitated by a strong majority o f the PCRh4 in the parliament. Checks and balances are
insufficiently developed between the executive and the legislature, and the judiciary
remains weak. More generally, Moldova, like many other former Soviet Republics, is
struggling with the legacy o f a vast bureaucracy enjoying significant discretionary power.
This stifles entrepreneurship and slows the demand for economic reform that would come
from a vibrant private sector. Large outward migration by the young and well-educated has
further contributed to reducing demand for change.

26.
Barriers to competition impede the development of the private sector. The
review o f governance arrangements in selected sectors reveals institutional flaws and
invasive special interests that distort the policymaking environment and hamper Moldova’s
growth potential. The relatively l o w quality o f physical infrastructure, the high bribe tax
(3.5 percent o f contract value), cumbersome licensing procedures, excessive authorization
requirements, and proliferation o f fee-for-services to public authorities and commercial
organizations all contribute to a business environment that remains among the most

challenging in the region. For example, in the Doing Business Dealing with Construction
Permits indicator, Moldova ranks 158th out o f 176 economies and requires twice as many
procedures as the average for OECD countries.

,

27.
The Government has taken measures to modernize the anti-corruption policy
framework. Since the beginning o f the anti-corruption reform in year 2000, the
government has driven a broad range o f legislative initiatives and institutional reforms:
passage o f an Action Plan and a new anti-corruption law (2004-2005); adoption o f an EUMoldova Action Plan and an anti-corruption framework anchored in the Economic Growth
and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP); promulgation o f an Anti-Money
Laundering L a w and strategy (2007), Anti-Trafficking L a w and Action Plan (2007);
ratification o f the 2008 European Convention for Combating Human Trafficking, and
adoption o f a N e w Guard L a w (2007). Moldova also opted to establish a specialized
agency, the Center for Combating Economic Crimes and Corruption, which however i s
perceived as politicized and targeting primarily low-level corruption and crime.
28.
The Government recognizes governance and anti-corruption as a significant
challenge and has achieved encouraging progress in some areas. This includes
modernization o f public sector governance institutions responsible for public finance,
macroeconomic management, and the supreme audit institution (Court o f Accounts), which
should help deter and prevent opportunities for corruption. The new procurement law
passed in 2007 also aims to rectify some o f the corruption problems in public procurement.
In addition, the second stage o f the comprehensive regulatory reform (Guillotine 2) aims to
rationalize and mainstream the system and establish among others a single and transparent
licensing system.
29.
Despite these achievements, significant governance challenges remain as
government commitment has wavered. Between 2004 and 2007, the government
implementation effort slowed down. This i s reflected by the deteriorating country ranking
on the Transparency International (TI) corruption index, placing Moldova at 109th place in
2008 (down from 79 in 2006). Public administration reform initiated in 2006 has largely
stalled. The National Development Strategy (NDS) signals a renewed government
commitment to combat corruption and accurately identifies as priorities judicial
independence, judicial system consolidation, curtailing the extensive powers o f the General
Prosecutor’s office, and preventive anti-corruption.
30.
Moldova’s European aspirations require full attention to governance and
institutional development issues and a sustained commitment to improving them over
the long term. The CGAC Strategy accompanying this CPS, elaborated in more detail in
Annex 2, emphasizes continued engagement on public sector and public financial
management reforms on the supply side o f good governance, but recognizes that progress
may continue to be gradual. Therefore, to deepen the impact o f supply-side interventions,
the CGAC Strategy also foresees a program o f analytical and advocacy work to support the
demand for good governance. In doing so, it builds on an analysis o f the main drivers o f
Moldova’s political economy. It emphasizes in particular the importance o f using
remittances for productive investments, reducing the brain drain and enhancing
competitiveness through improved opportunities for agri- and rural business development,
and the role o f public accountability for improved public service delivery. The CGAC

11

Strategy also contains interventions to strengthen the capacity for public sector planning,
budgeting and performance-based management as the foundation for streaming increasing
donor assistance through the budget. This will strengthen country ownership and leadership
o f the good governance agenda and ultimately leverage donor resources for significantly
greater development effectiveness.

11. COUNTRY PRIORITIES AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
3 1.
As Moldova approaches middle-income status, the country needs a sustainable
growth strategy, recognizing that it i s unlikely that remittance flows-which have
fueled consumption-led growth the last few years-will continue to grow very rapidly.
Although migration and remittances will likely be key drivers o f growth and development
over the CPS period and for some time to come, Moldova needs to create the conditions for
remittances to be used as productively as possible, such as through strengthening financial
intermediation and improvements in the business environment, to allow Moldova to
increase private savings and investment. This will require addressing three inter-related
challenges: (i)enhancing the competitiveness o f the economy to support sustainable
economic growth, (ii)promoting human resource development and the improvement o f
public services, and (iii)strengthening public sector management for a more efficient and
transparent use o f public resources.
A.

Country Development Program

32.
The National Development Strategy i s the main medium-term strategic
planning paper which defines the developmental objectives and will guide the
budgetary process over the period 2008-2011. The NDS, the successor to the EGPRSP,
was adopted by the Moldovan Parliament in December 2007. I t was discussed along with
the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) by the Boards o f IDA and IMF in March 2008.
Under the NDS, the Government will seek to better prioritize its policies and establish a
clear funding mechanism from both domestic and external sources. As with the EGPRSP,
the NDS was developed in broad-based consultations with stakeholders and civil society,
and benefited from a participatory process that was organized under the supervision o f a
Participation Council comprised o f representatives o f all stakeholder groups.
33.
The NDS reflects the Government’s objective of reducing poverty from a
comprehensive development perspective. Consistent with the EGPRSP and the EUMoldova Action Plan, the NDS i s constructed around five medium-term cross-sectoral
priorities (with macroeconomic stability and improved public administration capacity
viewed as prerequisites for the achievement o f these priorities):
Strengthening democracy based on the rule of law and respect for human rights
principles. This pillar focuses on building trust in the decision making bodies o f
government. It aims to improve the participatory process in decision making;

modernize and increase the efficiency o f the judiciary and the police; take further
reforms to prevent and combat corruption; and improve state border management.
Settlement of Transnistrian conflict and reintegration of the country. The
reintegration o f the country has always been a high priority o f the Government.
This pillar seeks to address both the political and economic dimensions o f the

12

0

problem by promoting the development of stronger civil society linkages,
demilitarization, and creating the conditions for further economic cooperation
between the two banks o f the Nistru by eliminating barriers to commerce.
Enhancing competitiveness of the national economy. Covering a number o f crosscutting issues, this pillar focuses on policies to improve the business environment so
as to encourage more investment activity, technological innovation and
modernization; promote the expansion of the SME sector; increase labor
productivity; improve state asset management; promote inclusion into international
networks; address Moldova’s deteriorating physical infrastructure; and reduce i t s
energy vulnerability.
Human resource development, enhancing employment and promoting social
inclusion. Policies under this pillar seek to improve the quality o f and access to
education services as well as the efficiency o f public spending on education;
enhance the quality o f health services through further infrastructure optimization
and expanding the coverage o f health insurance; promote the efficiency o f the labor
market; improve youth employability and employment opportunities; enhance the
efficiency and targeting o f social assistance; and strengthen the financial stability o f
the pension system.
Regional development. With most o f Moldova’ poor residing in the rural sectors,
this NDS pillar seeks to promote the development o f small towns as “poles o f
growth”; enhance the performance o f the agricultural sector; increase investment in
rural infrastructure; and improve the policy framework in the area o f the
environment and natural resource use.

34.
The NDS builds upon the institutional framework for monitoring and
evaluation developed under the EGPRSP. I t develops a comprehensive results
framework by including a number o f key targets and indicators. In particular, the N D S lays
out country-specific Millennium Development Goals with targets to be achieved within the
N D S implementation period. As noted in the Joint Staff Advisory Note, the large number
o f indicators presented in the N D S will likely stretch the capacity o f the Government to
collect and analyze the data and highlights the need for further prioritization o f these
monitoring indicators.
35.

T o implement the NDS, the Government of Moldova will need to continue
strengthening the capacity of the line ministries to develop and implement action
plans and integrate these plans in the medium-term expenditure framework. The
JSAN included the recommendation that greater emphasis be placed on developing robust
civil service management capacity; continuing efforts to reduce administrative and
regulatory barriers since Moldova is falling behind on a number o f indicators o f
competitiveness; accelerating efforts to halt the deterioration o f physical infrastructure; and
continuing education and health reforms since a competitive labor force i s key to future
development and the attainment o f the MDGs.

B.

Structural and Sectoral Issues: Progress and Challenges

Competitive Market Environment and Sustainable Growth

36.

Moldova’s industrial output and exports continue to be dominated by
traditional, low value-added products, and its current account i s chronically in deficit.
In 2007, the current account deficit was estimated to be about 17 percent o f GDP.
Enhancing the economy’s global competitiveness-the
ability o f the economy to
participate in global trade and investment networks-is essential for achieving long-term
growth. The normalization o f trade relations with Russia and the introduction o f
autonomous trade preferences by the European Union present an opportunity for promoting
export-driven growth. This w i l l be achieved through: (i)
raising the quality and quantity o f
Moldovan exports and promoting deeper integration o f exporters in global supply chains;
(ii)attracting greater foreign investment inflows to Moldova; and (iii)developing the
linkages between local f i r m s and foreign companies already in Moldova.

37.

I n recent years, Moldova, assisted by donors, has pursued a reform program
aimed at achieving sustainable private sector-led economic growth. Efforts focused in
particular on the ,business enabling environment, including: (i)overhaul o f business
registration system, (ii)streamlining o f regulatory regime through the so-called Guillotine
exercise for existing legislation; (iii)
introduction o f Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA)
for new legislation affecting business operations; (iv) modernization o f the national system
o f metrology, standardization, testing, and quality (MSTQ), and (v) provision o f fiscal
incentives for the enterprise sector.

38.
Despite the progress achieved by this reform program, Moldova’s standing in
global Doing Business ratings remains low relative to its central European neighbors
(103 in the 2008 report). The most problematic issues relate to construction permits, trade
across borders, paying taxes, employing workers, and protecting investors. Recent
enterprise surveys and case study interviews indicate that Moldovan entrepreneurs are most
concerned about: (i)the burdensome and unpredictable regulatory environment, (ii)
insufficient access to long-term finance, (iii)shortage o f skilled labor, (iv) insufficient
access to knowledge, (v) inadequate MSTQ infrastructure, and (vi) the weak transport and
logistics infrastructure.

39.
While Moldova’s financial sector has deepened rapidly, it seems in a relatively
better position to weather the international financial storm compared to regional
peers. The banking sector has experienced rapid credit growth (52% just in 2007), major
changes in the ownership structure, and decreasing spreads. Foreign participation in the
banking sector has grown with a number o f foreign banks recently establishing themselves
in Moldova. The recent wine ban and rising gas prices demonstrated that the Moldovan
financial system can withstand major exogenous shocks to the enterprise sector. Moreover,
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update conducted in 2007 issued a
largely positive opinion on the National Bank o f Moldova’s regulatory and supervisory
capacity, on the basis o f substantial compliance with the majority o f Base1 Core Principles.
40.

However, given the recent global and regional financial turbulence, some
caution i s warranted in the otherwise positive outlook o f the financial sector. Although
the banking sector i s relatively stable in the short run due to existing high prudential

14

requirements and weak integration into the global markets, it i s quite vulnerable in the
medium term as a severe recession in Moldova’s main trading partners could affect
negatively the flow o f remittances, leading to reduction in banks’ deposit base. At the same
time, reduced demand for Moldovan exports and a possible currency weakening could lead
to a rise o f non-performing bank loans.

A m a j o r challenge for the authorities i s to raise the level o f financial
41.
intermediation while keeping potential systemic risks under control. Moldova’s
financial system remains small relative to those o f most other transition economies. Total
assets o f the banking sector amounted to 60 percent o f the GDP at the end o f 2007, whereas
lending represented only 39 percent (in 2004 these figures amounted to 42 percent and 23
percent, respectively). The cost o f credit remains relatively high, and access to long-term
credit by the corporate sector i s very limited. Development o f the non-bank financial sector
could increase the relatively low level o f savings in the economy and fuel the growth o f the
domestic capital market. To mitigate risks, Moldova needs to finalize the legal and
regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions supervised by the newly
established National Commission on Financial Markets (NCFM), build NCFM’s licensing
and supervision capacity, and improve consumer protection and financial literacy.

42.
Timely, transparent and reliable corporate financial reporting i s critical for
strengthening confidence in the banking sector, improving access to credit, and
channeling remittances to good effect. The Bank conducted a Report on the Observance
o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) assessment in Moldova in 2004. Since then, the
Government has undertaken significant steps by adopting in 2007 the Accounting Law and
Auditing Law based on provisions o f relevant EU Directives and Regulations and
international best practices. Currently, the Ministry o f Finance, with assistance o f the Bank
and the newly established Vienna Center for Corporate Financial Reporting, i s in the
process o f implementing the Country Strategy and Action plan to enhance financial
reporting and auditing in the Republic o f Moldova.
T h e country’s economy i s highly dependent on road transport, and developing
43.
this physical infrastructure i s critical for enhancing competitiveness. Moldova’s road
network, totaling about 16,800 km, has been severely neglected during the past 15 years,
with few resources spent for maintenance and rehabilitation, For example, in 2006, an
amount equal to 0.6 percent o f GDP was actually spent on road maintenance and
rehabilitation whereas roughly 3.6 percent was required. A similar dynamic exists for
Moldova’s state railway company (CFM-Calea FeratSi din Moldova). Revenues from
freight traffic have been used to finance the operation and maintenance o f the entire rail
network and to subsidize passenger transport operations. Continued efforts to restructure
CFM are needed, but the lack o f funding has been an impediment given that separating
infrastructure management and transport services w i l l require some investment upfront to
establish separate and self-sufficient companies.
Moldova’s economy remains vulnerable to external energy price shock. This
44.
vulnerability i s due to the country’s dependence on imported natural gas which covers
about two thirds o f the country’s energy needs. Despite a relatively low level o f energy
consumption per capita, Moldova has high energy intensity, using twice as much energy
per unit o f GDP (at PPP rate) than Romania and three times more than the EU average.

15

While significant institutional reforms in the late 1990s helped restructure the sector,
improve the regulatory environment and attract private investors (three out o f five power
distribution companies were privatized in 2000), the sector reforms are far from being
consolidated. The recent rise o f energy prices contributed to the accumulation o f new debts,
mainly in the district heating in Chisinau where current heating tariffs cover only about 70
percent of the cost. The price o f imported natural gas continues to rise and i s expected to
reach the EU parity level by 201 1.’ Despite this price increase, natural gas will remain the
most competitive fuel for heating and electricity generation given the existing energy
infrastructure.

45.
T h e task o f reducing energy vulnerability must include improving efficiency,
reducing energy waste, and developing alternative energy sources. The policy response
o f the Government should focus now on: (i)consolidating the energy sector reform,
including through adoption o f new Energy Law and fwrther harmonization o f the legal and
regulatory framework with the EU energy directives and best practices; (ii)maintaining
financial discipline while adjusting energy tariffs to the full cost recovery level; (iii)
approving and ensuring adequate implementation o f the Energy Efficiency Action Plan,
including measures to facilitate investments in energy efficiency and alternative
(renewable) energy resources; and (iv) strengthening institutional capacity in the
government for policy making and contingency planning in the energy sector, particularly
from the point o f view o f protecting the most vulnerable population groups.

46.

An integrated and strategic approach for the telecommunications sector could
promote a reduction in the cost o f services, improve Moldova’s international
competitiveness and enhance governance. Although the telecommunications sector i s
quickly developing, Moldova fares much worse than most o f i t s neighbors in terms o f
prices and availability o f services. Better regulation and increased competition will be
required to change this trend, with cooperation between the National Regulatory Agency
(ANRCETI, the regulator) and the National Agency for the Protection o f Competition.
Developments in the regulatory framework include a new law on electronic
communications in 2008 and introduction o f third-generation mobile telephony. A new
Director for ANRCETI has recently been appointed, and the government i s pondering
whether and when to privatize Moldtelecom. This should be addressed carefully as part o f a
comprehensive ICT development strategy to maximize the development impact for the
industry and the economy and to avoid the creation o f a private monopoly. The
Government i s developing i t s national I C T strategy, which should be anchored around
three pillars: (i)
promoting competition and strengthening the regulatory environment in the
telecommunications sector; (ii)
developing the local Information Technology (IT) industry
as a driver o f innovation, entrepreneurship, employment for youth and economic
diversification; and (iii)
mainstreaming I T applications into government to improve public
sector governance, client-responsiveness and efficiency.

47.

A strategy to raise Moldova’s competitiveness needs to include attention to the
competitiveness o f agriculture and the associated processing sector. The sector i s
characterized by underdeveloped and imperfect markets and policy uncertainty, meaning

The current price o f imported gas (US$253 per mcm) i s about two thirds o f the EU parity level.

16

,

that agriculture has continued to underperform the industrial and services sectors in both
absolute and relative terms. Moreover, over-employment in the sector leads to l o w labor
productivity and correspondingly l o w incomes. Within this context, the high levels o f
poverty and the limited opportunities for non-agricultural business fuel migration-the
ongoing exodus o f Moldova’s valuable human resources. Although it i s observed across
countries that agricultural production declines as a share o f GDP as economies grow, the
sector should continue to grow in absolute terms.

48.
Government interventions to protect urban consumers create problems by
depressing profits and requiring subsidies. Land reform started in mid-1990s has
remained incomplete, as large corporate farms s t i l l account for 60 percent o f arable land.
Subsidies not only disproportionately support corporate farms, but they are also directed
mainly at inputs or outputs rather than investment or growth enhancing services. Moreover,
a highly regulated environment and limited public investment in agricultural research and
education have contributed to l o w private investment in the sector. The artificial pressure
created by these interventions deter investment in higher value agricultural products (e.g.,
horticulture with multi-year gestation periods) which would raise incomes and help to
establish a viable and competitive agricultural economy. In addition, this system creates a
significant risk o f leakage and corruption.
49.
Current r e f o r m activities such as harmonizing Moldova’s food safety system
with those o f the EU, developing a market information system, and taking steps to
r e f o r m the agricultural subsidy system are a l l advancing but at a slow pace. Global
food price inflation, rising land values, and increasing incentives to consolidate small
holdings and use land in corporate farms more efficiently are all promoting more
understanding and willingness to invest in knowledge and improved technologies.
Human Development and Improved Public Services

50.
The immediate challenge in the social assistance sector i s to successfully
complete the ongoing reform program-improving the targeting o f and access to social
services and increasing the overall impact on poverty. The social benefits system in
Moldova i s regressive but improving. In 2001, the lowest quintile received only 5.7 percent
o f all benefits, and the second quintile received only 7.8 percent while the fourth and fifth
quintiles received 44.6 percent and 28.8 percent respective1 By 2004, the first and second
quintiles were receiving 8.1 percent and 15.1 percent.’(
In June, 2008, Parliament
approved a social support law to establish an improved, targeted, social assistance benefit
scheme, aiming at ensuring a minimum guaranteed monthly income to vulnerable families.
In October, 2008 the law became effectve for families with at least one member with a
disability. The new system, to be fully operational by July 2009, will be directed to the
poorest 10 percent o f Moldovans. A consolidated database o f beneficiaries o f social
assistance i s in the design phase and should increase the government’s capacity to assess
the impact and effectiveness o f social assistance over time.
51.

Pension benefits in Moldova are n o t yet based reliably on actual contributions

paid. The general pension law (1999) to reform the pay-as-you-go pension system has met
the short-term objectives o f making pension payments on time, in-cash (as opposed to inkind), and without the need for budget transfers. However, the government has not yet
successfully eliminated pension privileges. Key issues that need to be addressed
immediately therefore include weak linkages between actual contributions and pensions,
the declining number o f contributors supporting a growing number o f pensioners as the
population continues to age, and the weak administrative capacity within the system.
Recent migration trends serve to accentuate these challenges.
Reforms are also underway in the education sector but further and more
52.
significant improvements in expenditure efficiency will be required. Public spending
for education amounted to 6.0 percent o f the GDP in 2001 and increased to 8.2 percent in
2006, representing the largest set o f expenditures in the national public budget (20 percent
in 2006). Increased spending has yielded positive measures to increase quality and access,
particularly the provision o f textbooks and food to children o f poor families and the
development o f new curricula. However, despite growing resources both in absolute and in
per capita terms (as the population o f school age children i s shrinking), key reform
challenges remain to be addressed. One area o f reform that holds great promise for the
future o f Moldova in an increasingly knowledge-based global economy, i s the integration
o f ICT in education, both as a subject matter and as a tool for the delivery o f education in
all areas and at all levels. This i s o f particular relevance in higher education, where a strong
link with the private sector, especially the I T industry, will lead to better employment
opportunities for young talent and has the potential to reverse the brain drain.

53.

The education sector continues to suffer from persistent problems related to
the quality of services, equal access, and institutional arrangements that do not
facilitate the most efficient use of public resources. HBS data from 2006 show that
household expenditures for education vary significantly by residence area and by welfare
level: on average, urban families spend 2.7 times more than rural families, and wealthier
families s end 7 times more than poor households or 30 times more than extremely poor
families.''HBS data also show that a household headed by a person with a university
education faces a poverty risk that i s 5 times lower than that o f a household headed by a
person with a primary or incomplete secondary education-thus signaling the importance
o f decreasing dropouts and removing barriers to high quality education services. The
Ministry o f Education and Youth with World Bank support has completed a School
Network Optimization Strategy and has developed options for formula funding, both o f
which w i l l be piloted after elections as part o f ongoing efforts to increase quality, access,
and efficiency.

54.
Health indicators have improved but remain well below EU averages.
Moldovan average l i f e expectancy at birth i s 68.8 years in 2007, 12 years shorter than the
average for EU countries, and 6 years shorter than for new EU-10 nationals, respectively.
The l i f e expectancy o f Moldovan women at birth i s the lowest in the European region at
72.6 years in 2007. There has been notable progress: for example, child and maternal

mortality has declined (see Progress Towards the Millennium Development Goals).
Nevertheless, chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases cause double the share o f
avoidable mortality in the working age population as in the EU-IO. The reemergence o f
tuberculosis and the emergence o f HIV/AIDS in the 1990s pose serious risks to the
population. However, a recent E C A benchmarking exercise to rate country performance in
response to HIV shows that Moldova i s leading the region in many areas.
Moldova's health sector reforms, while substantial, are not yet complete.
55.
These have included the introduction o f mandatory health insurance (now covering 76
percent o f the population) to address the problem o f out-of-pocket payments, but the base
o f contributors has remained largely limited to public-sector workers. Nearly half o f the
population aged 25 to 44 are not covered by insurance. Public sector spending on
healthcare has grown from 4.2 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 4.8 percent in 2006, which i s
high relative to other countries at a similar level o f development. Moreover, resources
allocated from the budget and contracts o f the health insurance funds with health facilities
are tied to inputs rather than performance. As a result, incentives for efficiency
improvements have remained limited. Formal co-payments for health services have
decreased as a share o f private expenditure; however, informal co-payments remain
substantial.

56.
Moldova's water supply and wastewater services are generally deficient. Only
slightly more than half o f rural communities have piped water systems and only
approximately 40 percent o f rural communities have sewerage infrastructure, which, in
many cases, has ceased to function. Approximately 80 percent o f all urban residents are
connected for water supply and 63 percent for sewerage. Few existing wastewater
treatment facilities meet standards, and many are abandoned due to operating costs and
lack o f maintenance. About 10 percent o f samples from urban water supplies and 16
percent from rural ones are contaminated with coliforms. The bacteriological quality o f
water in rural communities i s likely s t i l l worse. Given that Moldova remains a
predominantly rural country, i t i s imperative to implement a large-scale rural water and
sanitation program where the emphasis should be on replicability,and sustainability.
57.
Environmental degradation and climate change pose significant challenges for
the future. Moldova has in the past two decades experienced an increased number o f
droughts, the most severe occurring in 2007. The impact o f recent extreme flooding (July,
2008) on agricultural production and social welfare i s not yet clear. Other environmental
concerns are soil degradation, surface water pollution from run-off and agro-chemicals,
lack o f sustainable waste management (both solid and water), as well as increased ground
water pollution due to poor manure management in rural communities. Based on the
climatic change predictions for the South-Eastern Europe, Moldova also might face serious
problems related to water resources availability, especially for irrigation. Continued focus
by Moldova and development partners on emission reductions and carbon sequestration
through supporting carbon-financed projects and bio-carbon investments will be
important-in
particular for benefiting from the global carbon market and for soil
conservation and expansion o f the country's forested area.
Moldova i s a "signatory" to the St. Petersburg Declaration on Forest L a w
58.
Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) and has committed itself to combating illegal

19

logging and corruption and improving governance in the forest sector. However, a
study prepared in 2005 on the governance and illegal logging in the forest sector, identified
the forest sector as one o f those where corruption i s rife in Moldova and concluded that as
much as 42 percent o f wood extracted could be from illegal/unstated/uncertain sources. As
a follow-up to the St. Petersburg declaration, the Bank i s now assisting Moldova to
improve i t s FLEG through the development and implementation o f a National Action Plan.
The 3-year program o f assistance i s being implemented in partnership with the WWF and
IUCN, funded by a grant from the EC.
Migration and the associated remittances flows have made a strong
59.
contribution to poverty reduction, but are causing social strains in rural families and
among the youth.12 The National Bureau o f Statistics (NBS) estimates that over 300,000
Moldovans or 21 percent o f the Moldovan workforce resided abroad in the second quarter
o f 2006. The average Moldovan migrant i s 35 years old. Most are men from rural areas
where there are few employment opportunities; however, patterns are shifting toward more
opportunity-based migration that draws men and women with higher educational
qualifications who live in urban areas. One important recent trend i s the growing share o f
migrants obtaining permanent residencies in destination countries. As a result, the more
permanent migration o f families has increased, as has the risk o f brain drain.

60.
Moldova’s youth are leaving in massive numbers due to the lack o f adequate
jobs and business development opportunities, particularly in rural areas. Young
people (15-34 years o f age) account for about one third o f Moldova’s population, but they
face major obstacles in finding work. According to the Employment Agency, youth are 3.5
times more likely than adults to be unemployed. Similarly, the youth joblessness rate
(number o f young people out o f work, not looking for work, and out o f school) i s one o f
the highest in ECA at 30 percent. While Moldova has been struggling to address youth
issues in a comprehensive and cross-sectoral manner, there are a number o f important
constraints to youth programming in the country, including weak institutional capacity at
national and local levels, limited financial resources, lack o f equipment, limited targeting o f
the most vulnerable youth, weak monitoring and evaluation systems, and lack o f human
resources, particularly specialists. The launch o f both Moldova’s Year o f Youth in 2008
and the NDS provide important opportunities for facilitating youth training and
employment in the country and encouraging returning migrants to stay in the country and
contribute to private sector-led growth in combination with a targeted approach for the
most disadvantaged young people especially in rural areas. Moldova could create new jobs
for the thousands o f young graduates who work in the grey economy as programmers, by
promoting the development o f the local IT industry, encouraging the creation o f IT
incubators and techno-parks, facilitating the creation o f businesses in this field and
promoting access to credit, including venture capital and lending products designed for
export-oriented IT f i r m s .
61.
Women are paid less than men on average in part because o f occupation
segregation. Although education indicators are better for girls than for boys both at the
secondary and tertiary levels, human capital acquisition does not always translate into

12

20

better outcomes in labor markets. Women in Moldova comprise 47 percent o f the labor
force, but estimates o f the International Labour Organization indicate that women’s salaries
constitute only 60 percent o f men’s salaries. Women also have lower labor force
participation rates (43 percent versus 50 percent among men, in 2006). Moreover, women
are more likely than men to suffer from human trafficking and exploitation abroad.
However, these trends are improving and the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap
Report 2008 ranks Moldova in the top 20 countries. The report indicates that women’s
labor force participation i s almost 85 percent that o f men’s, perceived wage equality for
similar work i s among the highest in the world, and women hold nearly double the number
o f professional and technical worker positions than men do.

Public Sector Management and Governance

62.
Moldova’s ongoing governance agenda needs new impetus. Reforming the
systems o f public administration with the aim o f improving government capacity to
develop and implement policies, strengthening civil service professionalism, improving
incentives in the civil service to attract and retain professional staff, eliminating redundant
government layers and structures, improving the effectiveness o f public financial
management, and promoting the deployment o f e-government applications for better
service delivery and increased governance are all critical elements o f this agenda.
Moldova’s public sector wage bill as a percent o f total government
63.
expenditures i s among the highest in the region, including several advanced OECD
economies. However, public sector wages remain l o w compared with those o f the private
sector, and the system for compensation i s complex and lacking transparency. The
Government has set out an ambitious reform agenda aimed at modernizing i t s civil service
to European standards. While only 30 percent o f new civil servants were appointed through
a competitive merit basis in 2007, the recent adoption o f the civil service law should
accelerate this trend. The development o f a new transparent and equitable civil service
wage system, though delayed, i s underway. In addition, the establishment o f policy
analysis and coordination units have helped strengthen the linkages between the
Government’s policy priorities and the budgetary process. Continuing this reform program
i s critical for Moldova given that public sector wages are projected to rise and outpace
economic growth in the short-term, creating significant fiscal and macroeconomic
pressures and crowding out essential public spending.
Moldova has been strengthening i t s resource allocation processes by expanding
64.
the coverage o f sectors included in the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF). While there has been improvement in the management o f public resources, there
i s s t i l l a need to better integrate externally financed projects, centralized investments, and
other sources o f public investment into a single common public investment program.
Efforts are starting, on a pilot basis, to develop a common procedure for the identification,
prioritization, preparation and appraisal o f public investment projects. These efforts can
contribute to better public expenditure planning, thereby facilitating the more effective
allocation o f resources to meet stated policy objectives.

65.

Moldova has also demonstrated solid progress in improving other elements o f
national public financial management (PFM) systems and processes. A Public

21

Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment Update conducted in 2008 confirms
that solid progress in the quality o f PFM systems and processes has been achieved between
2006 and 2008. The most significant development influencing the scores was the creation
o f the Single Treasury Account, which improved the overall scores in cash management
and accounting recording and reporting. Other areas where scoring improved were payroll,
procurement and internal controls. Substantial work has been done on revising the budget
classification for the public sector and preparing for the implementation o f the integrated
financial management information system (to be operational in 2011). A solid reform
program i s also in place to improve internal controls and develop an internal audit system,
and to strengthen financial accountability through developing the Court o f Accounts into a
modern supreme audit institution.
111. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A.

Implementation o f the last CAS

66.
The country context and IDA’s allocation system have changed since IDA’s
last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Moldova (2005-2008) was de~eloped.’~
This strategy was presented to the Executive Board against the backdrop o f a difficult
policy environment, with the IMF’s PRGF and the World Bank Structural Adjustment
Credit I11 programs both having been recently suspended with less than one third o f the
committed funds disbursed. Given concerns about Moldova’s commitment to economic
reform, the CAS directed IDA support to mainly local interventions in areas with the
highest concentration o f poverty. IDA’S country portfolio followed a Base Case lending
scenario that provided only investment operations and specified a series o f reform
benchmarks that would trigger eligibility for High Case policy-based lending.
67.
At the time o f the CAS Progress Report (2006)’ Moldova had accomplished or
substantially accomplished most o f the reform benchmarks established as High Case
triggers. However, Moldova’s CAS was one o f the last to contain explicit lending
scenarios, and this was superseded by the IDA 14 resource allocation process-specifying
that country allocations are determined annually through IDA’s performance-based
allocation (PBA) system. This new system awarded funding based on country performance
ratings, determined by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), portfolio
performance ratings, and the governance factor. Moldova did receive increased financial
support according to the PBA formula, but this was below the level o f assistance envisaged
by the High Case scenario.
68.
Despite these changes, the last CAS was implemented relatively smoothly and
without major changes in the original objectives. The CAS focused on three pillars: (i)
promoting a competitive market environment, stability, and pro-poor growth; (ii)
minimizing social and environmental risks, building human capital, and promoting social
inclusion; and (iii)combating corruption and improving public sector governance. The
CAS Progress Report called for some realignment to the overall program to confirm that
the investment lending was complementary to the new Poverty Reduction Support Credit

(PRSC) program, that much-needed financing was provided for infrastructure (roads), and
that planned operations would fit within the PBA-determined IDA allocations.
Portfolio Management and Performance

69.
The overall portfolio including trust funds has been dominated by projects in
the infrastructure and agriculture/environment sectors as well as in public sector
reform. As o f December 2008, IDA lending operations include a PRSC program and 10
investment operations (with an additional 3 GEF projects), with a total commitment o f
US$159.3 million, o f which US$100.4 million (63%) remains to be disbursed. The ongoing IDA portfolio i s broad ranging covering almost every sector, but with a higher
concentration o f operations in the infrastructure sectors and in human and rural
development. The World Bank also administers a substantial $76.5 million trust fund
portfolio o f 23 activities-the largest in the ECA region-which provides co-financing to 6
IDA operations (39%), finances 6 stand-alone GEFKarbon operations (33%), and provides
other forms o f direct support (28%) such as an EFA-FTI grant o f $8.8 million for preprimary education and a $6.15 million multi-donor trust fund for public administration
reform. Trust fund resources support sustainable development (46%), human development
(26%), public-sector reform (22%) and competitiveness (6%).

70.
Analytic and advisory activities have complemented lending operations. Recent
non-lending activities include a Financial Sector Assessment Update with the IMF, an ongoing Country Economic Memorandum, a Public Expenditure Review, a Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment Update, a Private Sector
Development Note, pension reform technical assistance, telecommunications analytic
work, a Debt Management Assessment, and a Country Governance Assessment.
71.
All IDA and GEF operations currently under implementation are proceeding
satisfactorily as are the trust-funded activities. Project performance i s satisfactory in
terms o f implementation progress, with the disbursement ratio o f both the IDA and trust
fund portfolios consistently exceeding 20 percent annually, aided by the new country
financing parameters approved on February 1, 2005. Given i t s significance to the overall
program, a special review o f the trust fund portfolio was conducted in September 2008,
providing the following insight into factors for good implementation and thus for
increasing the likelihood o f achieving results: (i)strong ownership and governance, also
generally linked to good management capacity, are key for smooth implementation; (ii)
capacity to adapt to challenges and adjust project design during implementation
substantially lowers risks to failure; (iii)proactive support provided by the Bank,
specifically by local staff on the ground, result in more effective implementation; (iv)
combined resources o f Bank administrative budget and trust fund resources can enable
more frequent and thus more thorough Bank implementation support when an activity i s
anchored in a broader “program”; (v) unclear commitment from the Bank or the client can
be very damaging; but (vi) clear benefits to beneficiaries combined with solid
implementation capacity can make up for weak Government ownership.
72.
During the last CAS period, IFC continued to develop private enterprises and
assisted with attracting foreign strategic investors. IFC has been selective in i t s
investments in Moldova, particularly in the banking sector where transparency and

23

corporate governance continue to pose challenges. IFC provided over $15 million o f i t s
own funds in three projects over the 2005-2008 period. This included support to the
banking sector in long-term financing and trade financing credit lines to the local bank,
Mobiasbank where IFC provided critically needed term funding which would otherwise not
be available from market sources. This i s helping the bank expand i t s lending to small and
medium enterprises and also stimulate imports and exports by increasing access to trade
finance for entrepreneurs.
73.
IFC has recently increased efforts to support the private sector. In the
agribusiness sector, the Government has requested IFC’s assistance in reviving the
country’s wine sector which provides employment for nearly 10% o f its population. IFC
provided long-term financing and advisory services to Bostovan Wineries Limited and i s
working with a private partner to help the company recover from the 20-month Russian ban
on Moldovan wines crisis and develop into a leading regional producer. IFC’s advisory
services include helping the company’s 700 grape farmers’ suppliers improve their
sustainability. IFC’s involvement in this project can stimulate other lenders and investors to
invest in the industry and in Moldova. Additionally, IFC has supported two regional private
equity funds which may invest in small and medium enterprises in Moldova.
Results Achieved

Over the 2005-2008 period, Moldova attained o r exceeded many o f the country
development outcomes set as targets under the last CAS. Economic growth surpassed
projections on average, and public debt levels declined to well below thresholds that would
signal debt distress. With the increased stability o f its macroeconomic framework, Moldova
worked incrementally toward a competitive market environment, by simplifying and
reducing the cost o f business licensing and registration, improving customs services,
increasing the efficiency o f the banking sector, and improving the efficiency and quality o f
energy supply in pilot areas. In the social arena, more Moldovans were covered b y
essential health interventions and maternal and child mortality rates decreased beyond their
targets. Moldovans in five communities gained access to piped systems for clean water and
sewage treatment. Finally, with IDA assistance, Moldova launched an ambitious public
sector reform program that included the development o f a medium term expenditure
framework for aligning public spending with development priorities.

75.

Although IDA’S performance under the past CAS was satisfactory, some
efforts have not yet achieved their desired outcomes. Ongoing activities in the portfolio
are expected to continue the pension reform process, improve the targeting o f social
assistance, complete the overhaul o f the business enabling environment and MSTQ system,
increase the access to and quality o f education-particularly for rural Moldovans-and
further build the capacity o f the public sector. The CAS Completion Report explored how
well individual country development outcomes were achieved during the last CAS period
and identified factors that contributed to or limited expected progress. This report, in
Annex 3, describes the results achieved in more detail and identifies lessons to inform the
CPS (Box 2).
The trust fund portfolio has contributed to achieving results. This has occurred
76.
through enhancing IDA resources in key program areas such as public finance reform or

24

initiating programs in areas not covered by IDA such as environmental conservation and
clean-up efforts in rural areas (Table 5). There is significant complementarity and synergy
across and between the IDA and trust fund portfolios, with 48% o f total grants linked to an
IDA or other trust fund activity. The trust fund review revealed the importance o f these
synergies to increasing the likelihood for achieving impact when activities are firmly
anchored in a multi-activity program. This also contributes to greater returns to client and
resources for implementation and to the Bank for implementation support.

What Worked Well and What Worked Less Well
77.

The priorities set in the last CAS were aligned to Moldova’s longer-term
development objectives identified in the EGPRSP. A critical focus o f the Bank’s
strategy was on supporting a stable macroeconomic framework-through helping Moldova
to manage and reschedule debt and through a series o f analytic and advisory activities
(AAA) to better understand and promote the factors needed for economic stability and
sustainable, pro-poor economic growth. The successful reduction o f public and publicly
guaranteed debt has improved the prospects for the success o f donor assistance, thus
making it more likely that donors will provide additional support for development. The
Government’s ability to maintain a prudent fiscal stance has buoyed fiscal revenues,
creating some fiscal space to increase public expenditures without increasing the relative
size o f government. In short, IDA assistance has effectively supported Moldova in
stabilizing i t s economy, continuing to reverse a decade o f economic decline and rising
poverty, and helping to shape an economic context in which development efforts could be
initiated with improved prospects for success.

Leveraging other donor resources o r supporting existing donor efforts have
served as effective strategies for enhancing the impact o f relatively limited IDA
assistance. IDA has increased i t s collaboration with other donors to address Moldova’s
needs, taking the lead sometimes in development efforts and sometimes providing support
to others’ initiatives. IDA’S constructive and evolving relationship with the Government
and leadership role in convening donors were both exemplified by the Consultative Group
meeting in Brussels (2006). At this meeting, co-hosted by the World Bank and the EC,
donors confirmed their commitment to the country’s reform program and identified
additional external financing in response to the recent economic shocks.

79.
Broad-based support and technical assistance for Government initiatives have
yielded desired outcomes where there was a combination o f strong ownership and
sufficient capacity in counterpart ministries. Bank staff have developed strong working
relationships with Government counterparts, and IDA assistance has provided effective
support for developing and implementing Government-led initiatives. Activities in the
health sector and, more recently, in transport, provide illustrative examples wherein
Moldova has worked with IDA and other development partners to develop sector strategies
that include ten-year investment and expenditure plans. In other cases, such as reforms o f
the policy framework in agriculture or in improved targeting o f social assistance,
government strategies were insufficiently developed or indeed contradicted Bank advice in
key dimensions. In such cases, a more targeted approach to demonstrate the viability and
positive results o f recommended reform strategies was warranted, together with focused
analytical and advisory services to strengthen counterpart capacity.
80.
Efforts to reduce poverty and improve the targeting o f social assistance have
had modest results to date, particularly for the r u r a l poor. Moldova’s economic
recovery was accompanied by a reduction in poverty, but this trend stalled in 2004 with a
slightly growing number o f rural poor. Activities under this past CAS did not effectively
address policy distortions and market imperfections that negatively impact the farm sector
or effectively target social assistance to minimize the benefits accruing to the middle and
upper income groups.
Box 2. CAS Completion Report Lessons Learned
Effective, efficient, and transparent public sector management i s increasingly important
for achieving development objectives. Targeted support plays a critical role in building
country institutions, enhancing ministry capacity, and enabling the development and
implementation o f longer term policies and, strategies.
Increasinggovernment ownership o f development efforts i s a priority: the mix o f budget
support, investment lending, and advisory services can be strategic in helping the
Government strengthen i t s leadership role.

IDA i s devoting only a small share o f the resources available from international donors
for Moldova’s development, and these can be directed strategically to leverage support
from other donors for optimal development impact.
Analytic and advisory services can develop a better understanding o f the linkages between
economic growth and poverty reduction, particularly for the rural sector.
Continual improvements to the results orientation o f the country program provide
guidance for identifying, pursuing, and achieving project- and program-level outcomes.

26

8 1.
Given that public domestic investment has remained very low, more support
for public infrastructure was warranted than that envisaged by the previous CAS.
In particular, the continued deterioration o f roads has had negative implications for growth.
The Transport Strategy within the EGPRSP focused on road rehabilitation as a key factor
in facilitating international trade and transport, and the Bank recognized the need to add the
Road Sector Program Support Project after the CAS Progress Report.
Continued efforts are needed to deepen collaboration within the World Bank
82.
Group. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has remained active in Moldova,
with a portfolio o f about $30 million supporting power, telecommunications, agribusiness,
small and medium enterprises, and local banks. Building on IDA’Sefforts in the health and
infrastructure sectors, I F C will collaborate and complement IDA’Swork with public private
partnership initiatives. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has also
been active in Moldova, covering part o f a large-scale power sector privatization effort that
has also been supported by IFC. MIGA has recently supported the start-up investment o f
an Austrian financial institution in i t s subsidiary in the leasing sector. MIGA’s outstanding
gross expenditure in Moldova amounted to nearly US$69 million in June 2008. MIGA
remains open to opportunities to support foreign direct investment in Moldova through the
provision o f political risk guarantees and will coordinate its involvement with IDA.

83.
The results focus of the country program has been strengthened under the past
CAS to better identify, pursue, and achieve outcomes at the project and program
level. The evaluations o f the EGPRSP and the EU-Moldova Action Plan completed in
2006 and the transition to the P B A system for IDA assistance have informed and promoted
an ongoing refinement o f results measures in collaboration with other donors. Within this
context, the country team has developed a results scorecard (Annex 4) that i s expected to
serve as a regular and updateable tool to better understand the l i n k s between the inputs,
outputs and outcomes o f IDA-supported and trust-funded activities. This scorecard has
provided a useful evaluation o f the progress towards individual country outcomes under
this past CAS, measured the quality o f the results orientation in each activity in the total
portfolio including those financed by trust funds, assessed the Bank’s contribution to
management for results at the country level, and guided strategic decisions to increase
impact. An updated version o f the scorecard will be used to monitor progress under this
CPS on a regular basis and will assess the results focus o f AAA products in the future.
Client Perspectives

84.
Stakeholders believe that improving governance and increasing economic
growth are the keys to reducing poverty in Moldova. The FY08 Client Survey explored
how various stakeholders in the country perceive the overall value o f the World Bank in
Moldova (Box 3). A plurality o f those surveyed believed that the Bank was prioritizing
appropriate areas o f work, and 58 percent indicated that the Bank should be more involved.
The main concerns among respondents were the Bank’s ability to safeguard against
corruption in i t s own programs and the success o f the Bank’s efforts to help the country to
reduce corruption and increase transparency in government.

Proposed World Bank Group Country Partnership Program

85.
This results-based CPS aims to assist in laying the foundations for sustainable
and inclusive economic growth in Moldova. The Bank’s strategy will balance the
objectives o f selectivity and flexibility, engaging in areas where the Bank can best
contribute to desired country outcomes while also adjusting for near-term political and
economic changes. The expected outcomes o f this CPS fall within three pillars: (i)
improving economic competitiveness to support sustainable economic growth; (ii)
minimizing social and environmental risks, building human capital, and promoting social
inclusion; and (iii)
improving public sector governance.
86.
This strategy i s directly aligned with Moldova’s National Development
Strategy. The Bank will work closely with Government and other development partners in
support o f two pillars o f the NDS: (i)enhancing economic competitiveness; and (ii)
developing human resources, enhancing employment, and promoting social inclusion. The
consultative process used in developing this CPS has identified those areas where the Bank
can best help achieve the strategic objectives set forth in the NDS (Figure 2).

87.
The choice of pillars for this CPS has been guided by the Government’s own
development strategy, client perspectives, the lessons learned from the previous CAS,
and the Bank’s understanding of Moldova’s development challenges. It builds o n the
strengths o f the previous CAS, which i t s e l f was closely aligned with the Government’s
development objectives as articulated in the EGPRSP. It promotes cross-sectoral
collaboration to maximize the impact o f interventions, and leverages other donor partners’
resources. As explained below, the first pillar brings together a diverse set o f analytical and
operational activities to enhance Moldova’s competitiveness, bolster and deepen the reform
efforts supported by the previous CAS, and assist the Government’s effort to accelerate
economic growth. The second pillar, o n the other hand, brings together a menu o f
interventions to help Moldova make full use o f i t s human resources. This includes the
efforts to build capacity, promote skills development, and provide adequate social and
environmental protection. The third pillar provides crosscutting support for all o f the
strategic goals o f the CPS by promoting better governance and modern, efficient, public
institutions.

Operational Principles

88.
This CPS reflects a strategic transition from the previous CAS through a twostep process. The first stage involves scaling up interventions and programs that are
working well within the existing portfolio during FY09 and FY10. During the second
stage, interventions w i l l be defined in more specific terms for the remaining years o f the
CPS period. This approach allows the Bank some flexibility to adjust the portfolio as
needed in response to issues emerging after the upcoming elections or as a result o f a
regional financial crisis. Second-stage interventions w i l l be clearly described in the CPS
Progress Report, and the timing o f this report w i l l be advanced if appropriate to ensure that
refinements to the country program are timely and effective.
The Bank Group’s program of support for Moldova will capitalize on those
areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage for optimal impact. Moldova’s
National Development Strategy embraces European integration as a central objective, and
the country i s collaborating increasingly with European institutions and receiving aid from
a wide range o f donors. In this context, the Bank should be strategic in i t s engagement, not
only in terms o f where to direct IDA resources and associated Trust Funds but also in terms
o f how to best leverage i t s own internal partnerships. For example, IFC can play a critical
role in ensuring that the Bank’s program appropriately addresses the needs o f the private
sector within the results framework set forth by the CPS.

89.

90.
The effectiveness of this engagement will rely on strong coordination and
harmonization with other development efforts. In some cases, the Bank’s expertise or

29

established presence in an area will warrant that it lead a multi-donor development effort.
The presence o f partners can substantially increase the returns on the Bank’s investments.
However, in other cases, IDA assistance or other Bank resources might not add sufficient
value for initiatives already heavily supported by other donor efforts. Above all, close
coordination among donors i s called for to minimize the administrative burden and
transaction costs for Moldova. Given limited IDA and administrative budget, the Bank’s
client ownership, (ii)consistency with Bank
choices for engagement will be guided by: (i)
priorities, (iii)willingness o f donors to provide administrative budget when the Bank i s
requested to take a lead role, and (iv) possibilities for adding to IDA financing to materially
increase the effectiveness o f IDA funds.

91.

Flexibility will be central to the Bank’s approach to allow for adaptation to
changing economic and political contexts. Since Moldova’s per capita income recently
exceeded the IDA threshold, the country i s entering a transition period-possibly moving
to lending from the IBRD. The Bank’s country program will therefore adjust the use o f
instruments as appropriate, s t i l l using all available IDA assistance but likely investing less
in projects and more in analytic and advisory activities (AAA) over time as would befit a
middle income country. Given the additional costs o f administering Trust Funds, the Bank
will also be more strategic in their use to ensure that they directly complement IDA and
AAA activities. The country is also facing some political uncertainty, with a new
government expected in 2009, and collaboration with the new government could warrant
some changes. The evolving situation with regard to Transnistria might also open up
possibilities for engagement there through Moldovan government-led programs. l4 Finally,
new areas o f engagement such as climate change could gain importance during this CPS
period and require that the country program be adapted to take advantage o f existing and
new instruments, including Carbon Finance Funds and the newly created Climate
Investment Funds.

92.
All activities and resources delivered as part o f the Bank’s program will
adhere to the results framework, with clear milestones to monitor implementation
and country outcomes through which to gauge impact. This results-based CPS calls for
IDA assistance and any other Bank resources, including Trust Funds, to be used only for
activities that are realistic in scope and that are expected to directly influence CPS
outcomes. Given the tension between flexibility and results, the Bank will have a rolling
results framework which can be adjusted over time.
Implementation Measures

93.
The CPS foresees a lending program o f two to three operations per year-at
least one o f which would be budget support. Commitments will total approximately
US$45-$50 million per annum, with the specific country allocation being determined
annually through IDA’Sperformance-based allocation system. In addition, the Bank will
consider additional financing to existing operations within the current portfolio and support
for projects with regional or global goods components. Overall, investment operations and

l 4 A Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant to provide additional financing to the Social Investment
Fund 2 for Transnistria has recently been approved. This i s the only activity involving Transnistria that i s
currently envisioned under this CPS.

30

associated trust funds will build on the Bank’s track record and comparative advantage visa-vis other partners and focus in those areas where other funding can be highly leveraged.
The components o f the lending program will be strategically selected and refined to
achieve targeted results for the three CPS priorities: competitiveness, human resource
development, and good governance.
94.
I t i s expected that Moldova will fully utilize the IDA-15 lending envelope.
However, there may be circumstances under which the entire IDA envelope may not be
able to be utilized due to: i)a political and/or economic governance environment which i s
non-conducive for lending; and/or ii)an extended political transition period resulting in
insufficient government capacity to make effective use o f IDA resources.

95.
Partnerships within the World Bank Group will be leveraged strategically to
better achieve the desired country development outcomes. Both IFC and MIGA will
continue their involvement in Moldova and will remain open to opportunities for
supporting the competitiveness and private sector development priorities. Possibly areas o f
collaboration for the World Bank Group are in the health sector and in the infrastructure
sector if more privatization happens as a result o f IDA’Sefforts.
96.
Moldova i s a strategic priority for IFC and during this CPS period IFC will
increase i t s investment activities and advisory services in the country. IFC’s main goal
i s to support private sector development, focusing in particular on financial sector,
agribusiness, healthcare and infrastructure modernization. IFC will collaborate closely with
IDA in these areas. Discussions with the Government are already in progress on the
benefits o f public private partnership (PPP) for infrastructure modernization, and-in the
health sector-IFC will collaborate with IDA on a joint project to assess how the role of
the private sector can be increased. This assessment will be followed by at least one PPP to
be structured by the Minister o f Health with IFC’s support. In the real sector, IFC will
remain opportunistic and support companies from the region looking to expand and invest
in Moldova. For example, in the telecom and I C T sector, if the government decides to
privatize Moldtelecom, IFC i s prepared to consider advisory services and investment to
support this process, as well as the nascent local IT industry, should an appropriate
opportunity arise. Finally, IFC will continue to support regional private equity funds which
can provide not only scarce equity financing but also managerial and strategic support to
improve the competitiveness o f Moldovan companies.

97.

IFC priority in Moldova i s to provide investments geared at strengthening the
financial sector, expanding lending capacity and improving governance. The
Moldovan financial system i s dramatically underdeveloped and suffers from a lack o f
transparency and poor corporate governance practices. IFC will provide credit lines and
advisory services to major banks for lending to SMEs which are significantly underserved
by the financial sector. This support i s crucial for the sustainable development o f the
private sector across Moldova and will contribute to the increased competition in the
financial sector as well as create a demonstration effect for other investors. In addition, IFC
will promote energy efficiency credit lines and the development o f non-bank financial
institutions.
98.

When feasible, I F C will look to invest directly in companies operating in

31

agribusiness. IFC will also work with financial institutions which lend in the sector to
provide long-term financing and capacity building advisory services. For example, in
continuing i t s support for Bostavan Wineries Limited, IFC i s already launching an advisory
services project financed by the Italian trust fund to find out how 700 grape suppliers can
improve their incomes either by more efficient production or by diversifying.

99.
MIGA will continue to promote foreign direct investment in Moldova through
the provision of political risk guarantees. MIGA will support the investments o f regional
financial institutions geared at strengthening the financial sector. In particular, MIGA will
continue to support investments that promote the development o f non-bank financial
institutions. MIGA will also consider opportunities in the infrastructure sector. MIGA will
coordinate i t s involvement in this area with IDA. In addition, MIGA i s prepared to support
projects in the agribusiness, manufacturing and services sectors. MIGA i s open to
supporting investments that promote the development o f SMEs in Moldova through i t s
Small Investment Program.

100. During the implementation period of the CPS, discussions will take place with
the authorities and within the Bank on a medium-term road map to IBRD status. An
initial credit assessment will be undertaken by the IBRD Credit Department in FY09. In
parallel, the Bank will work with the authorities to strengthen debt management. Eligibility
for IBRD loans will depend on Moldova’s sustained and credible track record o f economic
performance, and the credit assessment will be based on an analysis o f eight components o f
creditworthiness: political risk, external debt and liquidity, fiscal policy and public debt
burden, balance o f payments risks, economic structure and growth prospects, monetary and
exchange rate policy, financial sector risks, and corporate sector debt and vulnerabilities.
101. Analytic and advisory work will continue to be a core element of the program,
with the Bank shifting toward greater financing of AAA versus lending operations.
The Bank will continue as a leading external source o f economic and social analysis and
will use this analysis to discuss policy choices with the authorities. Analytical work will
focus on needed structural reforms and on those issues most critical to reducing the risks to
the population posed by transition and external shocks. For example, a C E M (FY09) will
enhance the existing body o f knowledge on Moldova’s competitiveness, constraints to
possible sources o f future economic growth, and policy options to ensure that future growth
i s sustainable, broad-based, and able to make full use o f Moldova’s human and financial
resources. As part o f the broader transition to a blended or IBRD lending program, the
Bank will make a shift toward greater financing o f AAA versus lending operations with an
emphasis in those areas where there are real knowledge gaps, e.g. climate change, food
security, local governance, rural poverty.

102. The PRSC (and subsequent DPL) program will remain the main policy-based
lending instrument o f the Bank for providing support to the implementation of the
NDS. The cross-sectoral PRSC agenda will be explicitly aligned with EU budget support
with the second 3-year series commencing in FY10. The complementarity o f efforts
between programmatic support under the PRSC/DPL and investment lending will be key to
making efficient use o f Bank resources, Synergies will be found between policy-based
lending, investment projects and trust funds to support institutional reforms and capacity
building required for increased competitiveness and improved governance-helping the

32

government realize i t s vision o f a private-sector led economy. These investment projects
support reforms in the areas o f business environment and the agricultural, environmental
and rural sectors. The Bank also supports a number o f projects aimed at improving the
efficiency o f public sector resource use including more effective and transparent
management o f public finances as well as broader public administration reform efforts.
Bank operations have also focused on improving resource use in specific sectors, including
energy, water and sanitation, and road infrastructure. In the social sectors, Bank support i s
provided in the context o f human development programs in health, education, and social
protection as well as in support o f the government in scaling up efforts to improve the
targeting efficiency o f social assistance programs.

103.

The Bank will also make further progress toward programmatic approaches
and budget support modalities in selected sectors, reducing the number o f active
operations by the end o f FY12. This move must go hand-in-hand with demonstrated and
measured progress by the Government in improving the country systems and more
transparent and accountable sectoral investment planning (e. g., infrastructure, health, and
education) as well as strengthened public information disclosure mechanisms, and
increased efficiency o f government services (e.g., e-solutions, including e-government and
e-procurement). The Bank will assess how best to support these efforts during the CPS
period. To support the move to country systems, a Country Systems Assessment - a
programmatic approach to assessing government systems - will incorporate CPAR, CFAA,
PEFA, and other diagnostic tools as appropriate.
104. Non-IDA World Bank-administered projects financed by trust funds and other
grants will be strategically integrated into the Bank Group’s country partnership
program. With nearly half (48%) o f trust funds directly complementing existing Bank
operations, grant support will remain critical for achieving results across all three pillars o f
this CPS. The Bank will be more strategic in i t s use o f non-IDA resources to ensure that
they: (i)contribute to the objectives and outcomes o f the CPS; and (ii)
do not put additional
stress on the administrative budget. A review o f the Tkst Fund portfolio was conducted in
FY09 with a view to putting a framework in place that strengthens the linkage between
trust funds, strategic priorities and CPS outcomes, and provides a basis for exercising
selectivity.
105. The Bank’s work on governance and anti-corruption will be consistent with
the Bank’s recently approved corporate strategy.I5 As with other key reform areas,
country ownership and leadership are critical in this area together with the coordinated
roles o f other donors. This i s the only way that the Bank’s program can make a decisive
difference in the period o f the proposed engagement strategy and improve Moldova’s
standing on various comparative governance measures. The proposed engagement will
include an advocacy role for reforms on governance and measures to address corruption,
seek to develop areas in which the government and the Bank have common goals, and
ensure that appropriate fiduciary oversight i s applied to proposed resource transfers from
the Bank, during preparation, implementation, as well as through regular portfolio reviews..

33

106. I n addition, the Bank will emphasize the need for good governance for
harnessing a competitive business environment. This focus will include: (i)
continuing
the implementation assistance for competition and regulatory reform and curbing
bureaucratic discretion; (ii)strengthening the financial intermediatiodinfrastructure in the
banking sector and increasing the transparency in corporate financial reporting, with the
assistance o f the Vienna Center for Corporate Financial Reporting; (iii)addressing
competitiveness gaps by further development o f the export potential for the agricultural
sector; and (iv) engaging the private sector on strengthening the demand side for good
governance. Annex 2 elaborates the proposed program o f support for CGAC activities.
The proposed activities are fully integrated with the objectives o f this CPS and would help
to achieve greater depth and sustainability o f the CPS objectives by strengthening the
demand side for good governance (DFGG).
Proposed Program of Support

107.

The proposed program o f lending and AAA work links systematically to the
Bank’s ongoing portfolio to support the country development agenda set forth in the
NDS. Table 6 presents the activities planned for FY09 and FY 10. As part o f the two-step
approach set forth in this strategy, the lending in italics are well-performing operations
where additional resources can be absorbed to assist in achieving the CPS objectives. The
AAA program supported by the CPS contains core diagnostic studies and ESW to
strengthen the capacity for improved governance mainly on the supply side, and also on the
demand side, e.g. promoting greater transparency and accountability o f public and private
institutions. The two year program adheres to the selectivity principles set out in paragraph
90 as it reflects explicit requests from the government o f Moldova (client ownership) and
builds on existing, successful IDA operations (comparative advantage). Programming
decisions beyond FYlO will be guided by CPS operational principles and priorities that
may emerge in the course o f the next two years (e.g. roads, agricultural competitiveness,
food safety, trade, deinstitutionalization, energy efficiency, public sector reform).

108. This proposed program i s designed to achieve progress under the three CPS
pillars by focusing on ten strategic goals. The results matrix (Annex 5) presents each o f
these goals to outline how the ongoing portfolio and the new program o f support below will
contribute to the overall objectives and outcomes o f the CPS related to improving
economic competitiveness, developing human resources, and improving public sector
management.

109. Under the first pillar, ongoing efforts to increase the competitiveness of
Moldova’s enterprise sector will be augmented with an enhanced focus by I D A and
I F C on the agro-processing sector. Additional financing will be added for the successful
Competitiveness Enhancement Project (CEP) and the Rural Investment Support Project 2
to expand the scope and range o f available market-based instruments. This additional
project financing i s expected to facilitate the growth o f the export-oriented real sector with
higher value added in Moldova through a combination o f (i)
the matching grant scheme
(based on the successful CEP pilot) to assist enterprises with upgrading their labor skills
and management practices and expanding production; (ii)the line o f credit through
qualified commercial banks to support long-term investment and working capital needs o f
exporters, and (iii)
the provision o f internationally recognized laboratory testing services to
local producers, particularly in the area o f food safety. The envisaged lending will be
strategic to increase Moldova’s export o f goods and attract foreign investments and will be
informed by complementary analytic work.
110. Developing the key physical infrastructure o f Moldova i s integral to improved
competitiveness and will be continued under this CPS. To decrease road user costs,
additional financing could be provided for the Roads Sector Support Program, and the
Bank’s collaboration with Moldova and other donors will continue on the implementation
o f the Transport Sector Strategy. Assistance for decreasing electric power losses and
reducing Moldova’s energy intensity will include scaled up financing for the successful
Energy 2 project, together with SIDA. In addition, a complementary set o f lending,
analytic, and advisory activities will be implemented to promote energy efficiency and
renewable energy production, including a potential energy efficiency line o f credit through
IFC. The Bank will continue to support energy efficiency measures across the entire
portfolio, e.g. the Social Investment Fund, the Health and Social Assistance project, etc.
111. Assistance under the second pillar comprises a coordinated and cross-sectoral
program to build human capital, promote social inclusion, and minimize social and
environmental risks. Additional financing will build on the successes o f the ongoing
Moldova Social Investment Fund 2 and Health and Social Assistance projects, including
PPPs with IFC involvement in the health sector, Lessons learned under the past CAS and
continual refinements to the portfolio’s results orientation will guide the implementation o f
new activities and the selection o f potential interventions to contribute to desired country
outcomes-particularly poverty reduction, increased access to quality education programs,
and improved health indicators. Given the importance o f providing opportunities for youth
to stay in Moldova and contribute to economic growth, the country team will continue to
identify ways to mainstream this agenda into the on-going and future work program. In
particular, the Bank will continue to work closely with the Youth Voice Group which has
already been extremely active in promoting the climate change and good governance
agendas throughout Moldova. The climate change agenda will be mainstreamed into the
CPS starting in FY09 with a stocktaking assessment and an identification o f future entry
points in the country program, e.g. through further carbon financing, climate investment
funds, etc. On-going support for improved water and sanitation and achievement o f the
MDG in this area will continue to be a priority under this CPS. Close donor coordination
in this area will be critical.
112.

The third pillar o f the proposed program will provide crosscutting support for

36

Moldova to strengthen its public sector governance. A combination o f interventionssupported by multiple donors-will help Moldova in improving the quality o f regulatory
services, developing and implementing sound public policies, and strengthening processes
for allocating resources. In addition, the CPS program will launch an intense effort at
awareness generation and greater participation o f citizens in the demand for good
governance.

113. I n support o f the CPS results, the AAA program will underpin the lending
program. The AAA will aim to provide timely knowledge and input to Government
policies and inform the on-going development debate in the country, e.g. pensions,
telecoms and ICT, energy, demand-side governance, trade, environmental issues (climate
change, forestry). In addition, this CPS reflects a programmatic approach to AAA planning
which will include an overall assessment o f government systems to identify opportunities
for the increased use o f country systems in selected sectors and projects. This component
will be critical for supporting Moldova’s continued efforts at statistical capacity building.
The AAA program will be closely coordinated with the government and other development
partners.

C.

Partnerships

114. 1DA’~spartnership with the IMF in Moldova’s development strategy has been
strong over the past few years. Bank and IMF staffs have executed joint work and have
continued to carry out joint missions at least twice a year for macroeconomic policy
dialogue with the Government. The IMF policy dialogue with the Government takes place
in the context o f the ongoing PRGF, covering the 2006-2008 period. The PRSC has been
prepared in conjunction with the PRGF to ensure the consistency o f the macroeconomic
and structural policy reforms supported by both programs. The IMF i s taking the lead on
macroeconomic issues while IDA takes the lead on structural and social issues. In a number
o f areas where the mandates o f the two institutions overlap, such as public finance, the
work i s being closely coordinated to ensure that consistent advice i s provided to the
authorities. The existence o f an IMF program, set to expire next year, has been an
important input for the determination o f the adequacy o f the macroeconomic policy
framework.
115. The Bank has been active in helping to improve donor coordination. Moldova
has worked with donors to harmonize development efforts and has achieved substantial
progress since 2006 (Box 4). Alignment between the Economic Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper and the European Union-Republic o f Moldova Action Plan and
the willingness o f external partners-including the US, the EU, the UN, Sweden, DFID,
the Swiss, and the -Dutch-to
align their assistance with the EGPRSP (now NDS), has
facilitated coordination on the ground. The Bank has worked closely with other donors
both in analytical work and in individual lending operations.
1 16. The harmonization process was carried forward through a Development
Partnership Framework designed to implement the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness. The framework, “Co-ordination and Harmonization o f Government and
Donor Practices for Aid Effectiveness in the Republic o f Moldova,” was signed by the
Government, IDA, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Sweden, UN, IMF and EU in Chisinau

37

on M a y 29, 2006. This Partnership Framework commits the parties to joint reviews,
harmonization o f indicators, and prior actions and synchronization with government budget
cycles with a view to reducing transaction costs o f assistance to the country. It also
contains performance indicators for both government and external partners to assess
progress towards measures for increased aid effectiveness.

117. Moldova receives development assistance f r o m a growing range o f multilateral
and bilateral donors. The emphasis o f these donor efforts varies somewhat depending on
their expertise and selectivity as follows:

The United Nations Development Programme’s new strategy for 2007-1 1 focuses on:
(i)governance and participation; (ii)access to social services; and (iii)regional and
local development.
The EU country assistance strategy for 2007-1 1 emphasizes: (i)democratic
development and good governance; (ii)regulatory reform and administrative capacity
building; and (iii)poverty reduction and economic growth. A three-year EU/Moldova
Action Plan was approved in February 2005. The last progress report on the Action
Plan was issued in February 2008.
The EBRD country assistance strategy (approved by i t s Board in September 2007)
focuses on private sector development, including support to financial institutions and
public infrastructure.
Key priorities for USAID include improving the environment for private sector
development, promoting strong communities and accountable democratic institutions,
and helping control most dangerous public health threats.
Good governance i s a major area o f focus for SIDA, DFID, and the Netherlands among
others. SIDA also supports energy efficiency and rural investment while DFID
emphasizes public financial management, public administration reform, and social
assistance. The Netherlands has recently approved a grant to enhance the regulatory
and supervisory framework for non-bank financial institutions.
In December 2006, Moldova received a US$24.7 million grant from the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC) o f the U S A to implement a two-year anticorruption plan
with five components, including:

strengthen the capacity o f the judiciary in preventing and combating corruption;
strengthen the monitoring capacity o f civil society and mass-media;
prevent and curb corruption in the health protection system;
curb corruption in the tax and customs administration and the police bodies; and
reform and improve the capacity o f the Center for Combating Economic Crimes
and Corruption.

The Government has submitted to M C C in early 2008 their compact proposal which
includes irrigation and roads.
Central European countries, including Romania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Latvia
and Lithuania also provide assistance, mostly in the areas o f capacity building and good
governance.

118. The Government and its development partners have recently expressed
interest in a joint approach to help Moldova over the upcoming period, utilizing the
newly designed National Development Strategy as the overarching framework in this
process. In support o f this joint approach, the development partners have launched a
division o f labor and mapping exercise (Annex 6). The rationale behind this exercise i s to:
(i)provide a useful, high-level overview o f Official Development Assistance support to
Moldova’s new NDS, and (ii)map and align projects/programs with the results o f the
National Development Strategy to better ensure coordination, avoid duplication, and
ultimately to make development assistance more efficient and effective. I t i s anticipated
that implementation reviews and monitoring o f progress toward NDS outcomes would
occur on a regular basis, providing opportunities to seek additional support or refine
implementation strategies as needed to achieve the intended results.
IV.

MANAGING AND MONITORING THE COUNTRY PROGRAM

A. Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation

119. The success of the Bank’s strategy in Moldova will be measured by the
achievement of CPS outcomes aligned to selected priorities set forth in Moldova’s
National Development Strategy 2008-201 1. The results framework identifies the
outcomes to which the CPS i s expected to contribute and provides measurable indicators to
assess the achievement o f each outcome. Mid-term progress indicators identify key policy
reforms and actions needed to achieve CPS outcomes. The core CPS indicators identified
in the results framework are summarized in Figure 3.
’

120. The results framework will guide the Bank in monitoring progress and
modifying the strategy as necessary to remain a relevant and effective development
partner. This matrix (Annex 5) l i n k s the Bank Group’s lending, investments, and nonlending activities to specific outcomes and specifies milestones and target values to assess
whether implementation and outcomes are occurring as planned. This results framework
reflects the evolving results-oriented focus o f the country portfolio described previously
and has benefited in particular from: (i)
the increasing rigor o f results frameworks for more
recent projects, (ii)
increased capacity o f country systems as supported by the Bank and the
World Bank Institute (WBI) for monitoring and evaluation, and (iii)
the development o f a
results scorecard to support management in monitoring the portfolio’s performance vis-a-

39

vis country outcomes, the quality o f the results orientation in each individual activityincluding those financed by trust funds-and the Bank’s contribution to management for
results at the country level. This evolution has warranted substantial departure from the
results matrix presented in the last CAS. The matrix o f results targeted by the CPS builds
strongly on the activities in the existing portfolio and the additional financing programmed
for FY09 and FY 10. Adjustments w i l l be made at mid-term to incorporate new activities
planned in the outer years o f the CPS, recognizing that in most instances implementation
w i l l not progress fast enough to contribute to long-term development outcomes during the
planning horizon o f this strategy.

Plans for monitoring and evaluation under this CPS will capitalize on
opportunities for increased harmonization. To this end, indicators from the NDS have
been incorporated into the results framework where appropriate and the Bank w i l l rely on
country data systems and unified reporting systems where feasible. The Bank will also
monitor the share o f IDA commitments in pooled funding arrangements and the share o f
on-going IDA operations using regular joint donor supervision missions.

122. The Bank will actively monitor implementation progress of the CPS with the
Government and key partners through annual NDSKPS implementation reviews.
The results scorecard will be one tool used in this process, and the Bank will increasingly
use NDS outcome indicators and country based systems for measuring results.

B. Managing Risks

fiduciary risks; (ii)
implementation capacity at the
123. The risks for this CPS include (i)
central and decentralized level; (iii)
external shocks; and (iv) political economy risks.
124. The fiduciary risk in Bank-financed projects in Moldova i s substantial, and
above the ECA averages. Lessons learned under past country assistance strategies have
underscored that due diligence and caution i s required in using the country systems to
implement new projects. However, the residual risk does not prohibit increased use o f
country systems for selected sectors and projects to the maximum extent possible.
Mitigating fiduciary risks by improving fiduciary controls at sectoral and project levels and
assisting Moldova with improving transparency and strengthening the capacity o f the
government public procurement and public financial management systems, as well as
finding optimal project implementation arrangements that use country systems where
reliable w i l l be the main fiduciary portfolio management priorities over the next CPS cycle.
The PRSC program, as well as the Bank’s and donor’s work in these areas, i s already
providing assistance to the Government in this endeavor.
125. The Government has limited institutional capacity which could delay the
implementation of its ambitious reform agenda. Most line ministries s t i l l have limited
capacity for the systematic selection and appraisal o f projects, implementation, and
evaluation and this may lead to the sub-optimal allocation o f budgetary resources. To
mitigate these risks, all the reform areas benefit from Bank and donor-supported TA and
capacity building programs or investment operations. In areas where donor engagement i s
limited, implementation risk w i l l likely remain high.
126. Greater integration into the global economy, both with respect to trade and
labor flows (i.e. remittances), makes Moldova more vulnerable to external market
developments. For example, the recent turbulence in global financial markets may have
adverse effects on Moldova through, among other things, a growth slowdown among its
main trading partners and among the major host countries o f Moldova’s migrant workers.
These may have significant poverty implications at the household level, depending on
households’ relative dependence on remittances and their sectors o f employment. In
addition, foreign inflow o f capital may fall due to a global tightening o f credit. This may, in
turn, dampen economic activity and job creation. Furthermore, the price o f natural gas
imports to Moldova w i l l rise to European levels over the next three years. Higher electricity
prices from Ukraine are also forthcoming. Higher energy prices may have significant
poverty implications with the burden o f the price increase falling disproportionately on the
poor and on households with limited alternative sources o f fuel. Rising food prices,
stemming from either domestic or international sources, if they outstrip income growth,
could have a disproportional impact on poor households.
127. The Bank, the IMF and other donors, have shown flexibility in the amount of
available financing to respond, if needed, to external shocks. A grant o f US$7 million
approved in August, 2008 under the Global Fast-Track Facility for the Food Crisis will
help to mitigate some o f the impact o f rising food prices in 2008/9. Under the PRSC
program, the Bank i s promoting reforms to improve the efficiency o f the energy and
agricultural sectors as well as the Government’s social assistance system. As demonstrated

41

at the Consultative Group meeting, Moldova will be the recipient o f considerable donor
financing in the coming years.

128. A number o f reforms - civil service, education and agricultural reform - could
be politically challenging as next year’s elections draw closer. Under the EGPRSP and
the NDS, Moldova has articulated an ambitious reform program. Over the last few years,
the Government has established a steady track record o f reform, albeit with some efforts
proceeding faster than others. The extensive consultations surrounding the development o f
the NDS indicate that a high degree o f political consensus has been established behind this
reform program. Along with the reaffirmation o f Moldova’s EU aspiration, this gives
comfort that the agenda laid out in the NDS will be pursued. These looming elections may
have an impact on the political consensus that has developed behind the Government’s
reform program; however, the close linkage between the Bank-supported reform agenda
and substantial donor assistance (DFID, SIDA, the Netherlands and EU) planned for
Moldova continues to be a mitigating factor.

ANNEX 2: MOLDOVA COUNTRY GOVERNANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTION
STRATEGY
Executive Summary
Given the current development path and institutional environment in Moldova, governance
remains a significant challenge to growth and poverty reduction. Weak governance,
uncompetitive private sector, and fragmented civil society together create a dynamic cycle where
a large part o f the active population migrates abroad instead o f being agents for wealth creation
at home. The Government recognizes governance and anti-corruption as a defining challenge;
however, the authorities’ commitment has not been consistent and the track record uneven.
Recently government anti-corruption efforts seem to have accelerated, but the results remain to
be seen.
Moldova CGAC Objectives. The longer-term objective o f the Bank’s CGAC strategy i s to assist
Moldova in developing sustainable rule-based governance, which w i l l support the pro-EU choice
by closing some o f the major gaps between the quality o f Moldova’s institutions and that of
institutions in the member states. Over the mid term, the CPS governance program will be geared
to assist the Government in achieving macroeconomic predictability, sustainability and a gradual
transition: away from the remittance economy and towards sustained competitiveness, a healthy
business environment, and investment in human development. The principles guiding the CPS
are to find new entry points for supplying good governance, complement these with selected and
promising demand-side interventions, and effectively leverage our limited resources through
selectivity and partnerships.
Approach, Trade-Ofls, and Selectivity. The lessons from the unfinished reform agenda and the
2004 CAS results, which primarily emphasized supply-side governance, prompted a renewed Bank
approach. The elements o f this approach are:

Align Moldova CGAC with the objectives of National Development Strategy (NDS) and
generally adopt an approach that emphasizes country leadership by working on strengthening
country systems, including public procurement;
Consequently, approach the governance challenge in Moldova as both one of the CPS
pillars as well as a cross-cutting platform underpinning the remaining two CPS pillars -Competitiveness and Human Development;
Continue to engage with the government on the supply side of good governance through
the PRSC series, the unfinished public governance reform agenda (PFM, PAR and CSR),
by stepping up implementation o f e-services for businesses and citizens and through
measures to create a competitive business environment, but recognize the progress along
these dimensions may continue to be gradual;
Put incremental efforts and resources into measures to strengthen the demand side for
good governance (DFGG) at the country, sector and project level;
Support donors’ lead in the anti-corruption effort where they have active programs and
comparative advantage; and continue to provide public goods for cross-country governance
monitoring and analysis.

45

Proposed Entry Points and Program. At the country level, the ongoing public sector reform
agenda, implemented through PRSC policy lending, P S M reform grants and technical assistance,
will remain a main entry point for pushing ahead with reforms o f the central governance systems
and reducing opportunities and incentives for corruption. Implementation o f e-governance
solutions for financial management, procurement, and service delivery will also improve
governance and reduce opportunities for corruption. Building o n the good progress made with
public finance management reforms, the Bank will extend i t s efforts on the country systems
agenda, with a focus o n public procurement, internal and external audit as well as building
capacity in central and line ministries for performance related budget management. This will
provide the foundation for a gradual transition towards greater budget support, as requested by
the authorities.

Specific entry points for the G A C strategy at the country and sectoral level may include:
Improving the sectoral investment planning in infrastructure, health, and education;
Reform the civil service pay system to increase performance incentives;
Strengthen the public information disclosure mechanisms to improve feedback loops;
Development o f the export potential for the agricultural sector and promoting food
security without distorting production incentives to increase rural incomes and reduce
incentives for outward migration;
Increasing the transparency in corporate financial reporting thereby attracting greater
outside investment flows;
Strengthening the banking sector and financial intermediation for flows o f remittances
to make them available for investment;
Increasing the efficiency o f government services by application o f e-governance solutions
(e.g. e-government; e-procurement);
Addressing the Demand for Good Governance (DFGG) by engaging vulnerable actors
with upward (middle class) potential and longer term stakes in good governance - e.g. civic
and private sector associations through building capacity for advocacy and collective
action.
Risks and Mitigation. The investment portfolio will continue to face fiduciary risks; yet the Bank
should continue to promote the use o f country systems for selected sectors and projects, where
residual risks are not prohibitive after mitigation. The main mitigation measures for
strengthening the fiduciary controls at the portfolio and project levels will include: (i)
invest in a
deeper understanding o f SOEs and state corporate entities’ management, strategic investment
further building
planning, and capital budgeting t o build the policy dialogue in these areas; (ii)
capacity for improving the public procurement system, (iii)
finding an optimal PMU transition
model; and (iv) strengthening the project design with controls along the project cycle and
broader public oversight. O n this basis, the Bank will explore the possibility to bring to readiness
during this CPS the first investment loan which would be implemented entirely using country
systems.
Results and Monitoring. The Moldova CGAC results monitoring will gauge success by tracking
actionable indicators and harmonizing outcomes with the downstream cross-sectional CPS
policy- and development results matrix. Implementation progress will be tracked through
existing and customized C G A C country- and ECCU2 G A C portfolio reports and advised o n
corrective actions by the ECCU2 G A C Committee.

***
The annex below presents the details o f the Moldova country governance and anti-comption
strategy. The strategy defines the objectives and the CGAC approach derived from the Bank’s
experience to date and the main identified challenges and drivers for change over the mid-term;
further, the strategy sums up the sectoral and thematic selectivitykrade-offs drawing on the
consultations conducted with the Bank’s country team, the Government and the donors; finally,
taking into account the magnitude o f the fiduciary risks and mitigation the strategy outlines the
CGAC priorities for 2009-2012, and makes recommendations on a ‘good fit’ program and a
framework to account for results.
Governance, Growth and Poverty Reduction

1. Moldova’s recent high growth has been driven by increased domestic consumption,
migration and remittances but there are strong doubts concerning the sustainability o f this
model over the medium-term. Moldova’s growth and poverty alleviation achievements have
been impressive- an average economic growth o f 7.0 percent annually since 2001 and noticeable
improvements in the transition indicators. Remittances inflows are likely to be reduced
significantly in the wake o f the global economic crisis at the same time as foreign direct
investment and other capital inflows suffer, forcing a retrenchment o f domestic demand and
likely slower growth in the near future.
2. Governance remains a significant challenge to growth and poverty reduction in
Moldova. The composite picture that emerges from the extensive analytical and diagnostic work
conducted by the Bank and other donors17 reveals governance obstacles and limited prospects for
quick wins. These limitations are complex, and are due to not only external structural factors but
also to the prevailing value-sets and institutional legacies. Progress is slowed by insufficient
checks and balances that would prevent high concentrations o f state power, conducive for
capture by special interests. The private sector i s weak and civil society i s fragmented’*. In
addition, Moldova’s prospects to j o i n the EU are r e r n ~ t e ’ ~and
, as a result a strong anchor for
institutional reform and improved governance i s lacking. Despite these constraints, Moldova has
remained committed to market reforms and a competitive electoral process; most Moldovans
prefer a democratic form o f government.
3. Pervasive corruption contributes to a widespread culture o f cynicism and a sense that
the public i s disenfranchised. Compared to a sample o f former Soviet Union (FSU) countries,
Moldova performs better or i s on par on several performance indicators. (Fig.1). However,
Moldova remains an outlier on “unofficial” payments for civil courts, public education, and
public health. One-third o f the population believes that corruption has increased under this
government2’. The same survey found that 70 percent o f the population view corruption as
widespread; 78 percent believed that corruption had recently worsened in Moldova, and 64
percent that corruption was “normal and inevitable.” Citizens surveyed think the most corrupt

the National Statistics Office, mayoralties, military, and local councils.21
4. T h e Government recognizes governance and anti-corruption as serious challenge;
however, while commitment has been good on paper, implementation has been inconsistent
and the record -- uneven. In 2000, Moldova initiated anti-corruption reform; with assistance
from major donors the government began to upgrade legal and institutional capacity to reduce
corruption and money laundering, and implement new legislative and policy instruments.
Institutionally, Moldova optea to

5. Recently the government has renewed i t s anti-corruption efforts; however, long awaited
results still remain to be seen. The National Development Strategy (NDS) signals a renewed
government commitment to combat corruption. The NDS identifies priorities such as judicial
independence, further judicial system consolidation, curtailing the General Prosecutor’s
extensive powers, and emphasizing preventive anti-corruption efforts.
Despite some

About 80 percent o f Moldovans believe that almost all civil servants are corrupt; many citizens typically solve problems with
the authorities by bribing civil servant with money (73 percent), gifts (65 percent), or favors (60 percent). Since 2005,
corruption among parliamentarians and ministers has grown;

weaknesses, at least on paper the rules for accountability o f the public officials provide a basis
for a strong reform implementation. For example, the system o f limited-duration immunities i s
better than that in some countries, although immunity coverage i s excessively broad and exempts
not only MPs and the President, but also a long l i s t o f prosecutors, judges, and public officials.
6. Progress has also been made in public procurement reform in moving towards
alignment with the EU aquis. In past years, the share o f the sole source contracting was
reduced from 16 percent (of total value) in 2004 to 7.2 percent in 2006 according to the statistics
o f the Procurement Agency. A new procurement law came in effect in October 2007. A Public
Procurement Agency, which reports to the Prime Minister, has been created out o f central
purchasing body o f the Ministry o f Economy.

7 . Moldova i s a party o f the international regimes combating illegal cross-border
activities, AML-CFT and anti-trafficking. In July 2007, the governme;lnt adopted a law on
Prevention and Fight o f Money Laundering and Financing o f Terrorism with CCECC being .
responsible for the coordination and implementation o f the law. During 2007-09, the National
Committee on Anti-Trafficking adopted a new action plans for fighting drug trafficking.
Furthermore Moldova has ratified the 2008 European Convention for Combating Human
Trafficking, and in 2007, adopted a New Guard Law. Finally, in 2008, the Parliament adopted a
law on international legal assistance in penal matters.
8. Given the limited resources and capacity o f Moldova’s civil society, i t s impact on
holding the government o r private interests to account i s quite weak. Although the civil
society in Moldova i s active and diverse in meeting identified social needs and represents a wide
array o f civic values (from good governance, social stability, consumer protection, gender and
minorities, poverty and social protection, environmental standards, and other public interests)
almost half o f the NGOs operate in the social sector. The majority o f Moldovan NGOs i s
financially struggling. Despite the recognized role o f NGOs in improving government
effectiveness and responsiveness in many countries, only 28%25 o f the Moldovan public perceive
NGOs favorably. Donor financed projects remain the main source for NGOs funding. NGOs’
capacity for monitoring o f specialized or complex reforms i s perceived as low also due to the
skills and expertise gaps in conducting advocacy campaigns and engaging the Government
effectively.
World Bank’s Governance and Institutional Reform Effort to Date

9. The 2004 CAS placed strong attention to governance and anti-corruption and addressed
public sector governance as one o f the three pillars aligned with the government program
objectives o f the EGPRSP. A considerable portfolio o f lending and analytical services26aimed to
implement the two governance and institutional reform objectives o f the CAS: strengthen the
capacity o f the public sector to develop and implement public policies; increase the transparency
and accountability o f PFM and improve public perceptions o f governance. The main lending
interventions and technical assistance targeted PFM reform, civil service reform, reforming
courts and the engaging civil society in growth and poverty-reduction decisions.

10. Implementation overall has been satisfactory. However most of the results concern
outputs, and there has been little impact on perceived corruption levels in general. In
addition, while progress with the reform o f P F M and public procurement has been steady,
improvements in public administration reform and civil service reform did not materialize to the
same extent during the 2005-2008 CAS. One o f the most important achievements has been the
launch o f the Medium-TermExpenditure Framework (MTEF) making possible a single Treasury
account for all budget transaction^.^^ Financial Management Information Systems (FMIS)
developed under the P F M Project TA have contributed to increasing the quality o f budget
preparation and expenditure management. An internal financial control and audit system
consistent with EU standards has been developed. A central policy unit has been established to
improve policy decisions and target them towards poverty reduction. The Court o f Accounts
(COA) i s transforming into a capable SAI, compliant with international standards2*.

11. A significant part of the governance efforts in the 2005 CAS were supported by donor
trust funds. While this allowed the Bank to leverage its limited resources, it has contributed to
some fragmentation o f efforts and a less than optimal use o f synergies with other parts o f the
portfolio. The present strategy present G A C activities as a cross-cutting pillar in recognition o f
the scope to exploit such synergies further.
Fiduciary Risks in the Bank’s Portfolio and Mitigation
12. The fiduciary risk in Bank-financed projects in
Moldova i s substantial, and above the ECA
averages. At the Bank’s 2008 fiscal year end, the
Moldova portfolio included 14 operations (including
GEF) with most o f the ongoing projects being rated
satisfactory for development objective and
implementation progress. The team that reviewed
implementation arrangements and assessing corruption
vulnerability in 2008 concluded that the vulnerability to
corruption in Bank-financed projects in Moldova i s
substantial. The Bank’s financial management (FM)
monitoring system recognizes Moldova as a “high-risk”
country with significant fiduciary risks (1 1 percent) in
the active investment projects (Fig.2) compared with
the E C A regional average (6 percent).

controls and external audit arrangements; high turnover among fiduciary consultants; and
inadequate information disclosure.

14. Steps to improve country systems and increase their use in Bank-financed operations
are to b e encouraged. Given Moldova’s track-record and high systemic risks, such an approach
should proceed on a case by case basis, and only if residual risks after mitigation are deemed
acceptable. The present strategy believes, however, that by moving in this direction, the
governance agenda can benefit from additional country leadership and ultimately contribute to
greater development effectiveness. Mitigating fiduciary risks by improving fiduciary controls
and assisting Moldova with strengthening the capacity o f the government procurement system,
as well as finding an optimal P M U implementation model will be one o f the main fiduciary
priorities over the next CPS cycle.

15. Finding the right implementation model faces considerable trade-offs between risks to
the project and capacity and knowledge transfer. Most investment projects are implemented
by traditional project implementation units (PMU) and recent efforts have been made to better
integrate project implementation with the agents responsible for the overall project execution.
There are three distinct models (Box 1) that apply to investment lending implementation in
Moldova. However, experience shows that none o f these models can fully protect the project
from manipulation o f bid outcomes or contract awards. Therefore, as part o f the transition
arrangements for mainstreaming PMUs, a readiness assessment needs to be conducted to identify
and address criteria, gaps and a timetable for transition towards greater use o f country systems.
16. I n the meantime, additional efforts to improve country-level fiduciary controls will be
needed. Country level due diligence needs to include the management o f state-owned
enterprises, strategic investment pianning,
and capital budgeting. Increasingly, the

17. I m p r o v i n g governance in Moldova
i s central to development. However a
big gap exists between the current level
o f governance quality and the country’s
EU aspirations. The unfinished PSM
reform agenda requires a ramped-up Bank
approach. Although the Government i s
willing and committed to deliver on the enhanced governance and the anticorruption agenda, i t s
efforts are limited by the country’s internal political dynamics. Furthermore, earlier Bank efforts
51

have focused primarily on the supply side o f governance institutions and focused on the
government as the main stakeholder and client. The last CAS results indicate that there has been
limited engagement with c i v i l society and private stakeholders to generate demand for better
accountability and transparency in the delivery o f public services by the government.

18. The longer-term strategic objective o f the Bank’s governance strategy will be to assist
Moldova in developing sustainable rule-based governance, which will support the pro-EU
choice and close some o f the distance between Moldova’s institutional quality and that in
the new member states. The Bank’s CGAC Strategy will continue to emphasize supply side
interventions, but complement these with greater attention to the demand for good governance.
Moreover, efforts to improve Moldovan institutions will be broadened to cover sectoral
investment planning, corporate financial reporting, financial sector deepening and others in
recognition o f the role that good governance plays not only for the delivery o f public services but
also for investment and improved economic competitiveness.

19. The proposed Bank’s strategic response will approach the governance challenge in
Moldova as a pillar and cross-cutting platform to support the objectives o f the two CPS
pillars aligned with the Government N D S -- Competitiveness and Human Development. The
Bank’s approach will rest on three main thrusts taking into account the limited Bank resources,
Bank areas o f effectiveness and likelihood to achieve results:
Continue to engage strategically the government on the supply side governance through the
implementation o f the PRSC series and the unfinished public governance reform agenda
(PFM, P A R and CSR) and competitive business environment at the country level;
Support the donors lead in the anti-corruption effort where the donors have active programs
and have been more effective with comparative advantage; provide public goods for country
level governance monitoring and analytics through the CODB, BEEPS and the WGI
instruments or through co-financing diagnostics (e.g. SIGMA) which can open new
opportunities for donors engagement o n advancing the anti-corruption agenda;
Increase the incremental effort and resources in areas where Bank efforts would render midterm results, i.e. sectoral governance diagnostic, demand side governance, strengthening
country systems and public procurement.

(i)Country Level: Sustaining Reform o f the Central Systems
20. The ongoing public sector reform activities targeted through PRSC policy lending and
PSM technical assistance will remain the main lending interventions for urging reforms o f
the central governance systems. PRSC program ensuring cross-sectoral dialogue and triggers
will provide the levers for promoting improvement in public investment management processes,
while the ongoing Bank projects for reforming the central public administration, establishing
meritocratic civil service, ensure effective public finance management and lessen the
bureaucratic burden will build capacity to reduce opportunities and incentives for corruption.

21. The Bank will work towards establishing the foundations for greater budget support by
strengthening the capacity for strategic planning, budgeting and performance monitoring,
as well as creating appropriate incentives from improved public sector management.
Achieving this will require further upgrading the public fiduciary controls and advances in
planning and execution o f public investments. This will be implemented by strengthening central
government capacity for managing the implementation o f CSR and PAR, further P F M reform
(which would ensure proper use o f procurement planning and monitoring), supporting the
ongoing development o f public procurement including e-Procurement and upgrading the

52

capacity o f the COA and reform o f the civil service pay system. By strengthening the capacity
for public sector management and putting in place key elements o f an enhanced country system
(e.g. completing the reform o f public financing and facility for midterm forecasting, aligning
spending with priorities, and strengthening the capacity o f public procurement) will create
conditions for making a transition to budget support and sector-wide approaches over the mid- to
longer term.

ii)Sector Level: R i s k s and Opportunities for Budget Support
22. T h e governance assessment diagnostics suggests the following development areas for
increasing governance effectiveness at the sectoral level in response to the identified sectoral
governance challenges:

.
.
.
.

Improving the sectoral investment planning in infrastructure, health, and education to ensure
greater effectiveness and strategic alignment o f public spending;
Reform the c i v i l service pay system to create incentives for improved public sector
management;
Strengthen the public information disclosure mechanisms to increase accountability;
Strengthen the financial intermediatiodinfrastructure for remittances flows and increase the
transparency in corporate financial reporting to promote investment;
Develop the export potential o f the agricultural sector and promote food security without
distorting production incentives to create income opportunities in rural areas and prevent
labor outflows;
Increase the efficiency o f government services by application o f e-government; eprocurement solutions;

23. Table 1 below summarizes the program o f governance-related AAA interventions
planned in the CPS. The program reflects a detailed governance diagnostic and several
consultations with stakeholders, donors and the authorities and i s targeted towards deepening
understanding o f linkages between different sectoral governance challenges and overall
development outcomes. It i s designed to enhance the effectiveness o f the Bank’s core IDA
funded assistance, including through a focus o n measures to enhance the demand for good
governance. The consolidated program i s presented in Table 1 below.

(iii)Project Level: Project Action Plans
24. At project level, the strategy will target further integration o f anti-corruption measures
into sectoral projects a n d programs, and strengthening the project design. Building on the
emerging Bank-wide body o f good practices, the strategy seek to implement this objective in
three ways:
Smart project design and smart fiduciary portfolio oversight over the project cycle;
Portfolio approach and review process;
Social supervision and accountability, enhanced public oversight;
Staff learning and training for operational staff and the task teams.

.

Donors, Partnerships, and Communication

25. E v e n with the recent growth o f the economy and increased flows o r remittances, the
share o f donor assistance in Moldova has remained substantial relative to government
expenditures; the global financial crisis and recession may further increase this
dependence. Donor assistance would be vital for the continuation o f the country's institutional
development and anti-corruption governance reforms (see Table 2). In May 2006, the
Government and key donors signed A Development Partnership Framework to implement the
2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and Harmonization. Thus, the Government
committed i t s e l f to develop capacity in leading the harmonization effort by improving country
systems and laying the foundations for the transition to budget support.
26. M a j o r donors in M f i d o v a include the EU2', the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) , and several bilateral donors. Among these, USAID3'/MCC32,

The 2007-1 1 E U country assistance strategy emphasizes (i) democratic development and good governance; (ii) regulatory
reform and administrative capacity building; and (iii) poverty reduction and economic growth. A three-year EUhloldova
Action Plan was approved in February 2005; the most recent progress report was Dec. 2006.
30 The 2007 EBRD country assistance strategy focuses on private sector development, including support to financial institutions
and public infrastructure.
3 1 Key USAID priorities include improving the environment for private sector development, promoting strong communities and
accountable democratic institutions, and helping control most dangerous public health threats.
32 In December 2006, Moldova received a US$24.7 million grant from the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to
implement a two-year anticorruption plan with five components: (i)strengthen the capacity o f the judiciary in preventing and
combating corruption; (ii)strengthen the monitoring capacity o f civil society and mass-media; (iii)prevent and curb corruption
in the health system; (iv) curb corruption in the tax, customs and the police bodies; and (v) reform the CCECC.

54

Sweden (SIDA), UNDP33, the UK (DFID) and the Netherlands are the most important
contributors. Eastern European countries, including Romania, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Latvia and Lithuania also provide assistance, mostly for capacity building and good governhce.

27. The Bank will regard partnerships and donor coordination for governance results as
continue to be a lead donor convening key
another delivery instrument. The Bank needs to: (i)
stakeholders and mobilizing donors’ resources to address national priorities; (ii)
lead in selected
governance areas where it has already established programs and dialogue. In areas where other
donors and partners have proven advantage or implement sizable programs, the Bank w i l l handover the lead donor role, offering i t s convening role as needed and remaining a provider o f
analytical support. Areas where the Bank can rely on the lead role o f other donors are: judicial
reforms (USAID/MCC; UNDP; EC); customs, security, police; law enforcement (EC;
USAID/MCC); border control, customs, combating corruption and anti-trafficking (CoE,
U SAID); regional development and empowering civic and local communities (DFID; UNDP;
EC, USAID).
28. Over the implementation period o f this CPS, the Bank will widen its outreach to a
broader audience o f public and private sector entities, sub-national government, judiciary,
and civil society to assist with anti-corruption campaigns or to support civic group initiatives for
increased public disclosure o f information and transparency for reducing the opportunities for
corrupt practices and fraud. Also, the Bank w i l l need to take a more strategic approach to
communication, integrating on demand political economy mapping and analysis o f key
stakeholders’ positions for coalition building over the entire project cycle. The Bank w i l l also
increase the transparency o f i t s transactions by making more information on i t s project activities
open to the public.
GAC Results Monitoring and Reporting
29. Results and Monitoring. The Moldova CGAC results monitoring w i l l gauge success by tracking
actionable indicators fully integrated in the outcomes o f the CPS results matrix. The implementation
progress w i l l be accounted through existing and customized CGAC country GAC portfolio reports
informing remedial actions reviewed and advised by the ECCU2 GAC Committee.

33

The 2007-1 1 UNDP strategy focuses on (i)
governance and participation; (ii)access to social services; and (iii)regional and
local development.

I.INTRODUCTION
1.
This report examines the implementation and effectiveness o f the Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Moldova as defined in the FY05 CAS document and adjusted in
the FY07 CAS Progress Report. To identify lessons that are relevant for the design and
implementation o f the new results-based Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), this assessment
considered the following:

Alignment o f the objectives o f the CAS with Moldova’s longer term strategic goals and
expected development results (Section 11)
Moldova’s progress towards i t s development goals (Section 11)
Achievement o f CAS outcomes and their contribution to Moldova’s longer term strategic
goals (Section 111)
The Bank’s performance during the CAS period (Section IV)

In addition to discussions with the country team and other stakeholders, this assessment i s based
on reference documents such as Project Appraisal Documents, Implementation Status and
Results Reports (ISRs), supervision reports (Aide-Memoires and Bank-to-office reports), reports
related to Economic and Sector Work (ESW), Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs), and
evaluation reports and ratings from the Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and Quality
Assurance Group (QAG).

11. MOLDOVA’S
LONGER
TERMSTRATEGIC GOALS
2.
The CAS under review for this report was developed to support the objectives o f
Moldova’s Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP), establishing the
Bank’s lending and non-lending support for Moldova from FY05 through FY08. The EGPRSP,
adopted in May 2004, was the first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper prepared by the
government o f Moldova (GoM) in consultation with broad-based stakeholders and civil society.
This document contained a diagnostic assessment of poverty in Moldova and a vision for
sustainable and comprehensive poverty reduction during the 2004-2006 period. In 2006, the
EGPRSP was extended through 2007.
Overview of the EGPRSP

3.

The EGPRSP identified three pillars to address the country’s main obstacles to

57

longer-term development: sustainable economic growth, human development, and social
protection. Using this framework, the government’s strategy outlined a long-term vision for the
development o f Moldova, established priorities for addressing the current obstacles to
sustainable growth and poverty reduction, and identified the medium-term objectives that should
be achieved within the 2004-2006 period. These objectives were the main focus o f the EGPRSP
and served as the drivers for the prescribed actions and indicators:

..
.

Sustainable and inclusive economic growth
Poverty and inequality reduction, and increased participation o f the poor in economic
development
Human resources development

4.
Both the medium- and long-term priorities identified by the EGPRSP were
explicitly linked with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs were adapted
“to the Moldovan reality,” with target indicators established to define successful progress by
2006, 2010, and 2015.34 The strategy therefore indicated broad priorities for development and
identified specific targets in some key areas through which to gauge success.
CAS Context and Alignment to Moldova’s Longer Term Strategic Goals
5.
The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy was presented to the Executive Board
against the backdrop of a difficult policy environment, and the alignment of the FY05 CAS
to the strategic goals set forth in the EGPRSP i s best understood by considering the
country context. Moldova’s transition to a market economy has been challenging, with high
vulnerability to external shocks, a volatile internal political environment, and mixed reform
implementation. Both the IMF (PRGF) and the World Bank Structural Adjustment Credit I11
programs had recently been suspended with less than one-third o f the committed funds under
these programs being disbursed. In addition, the policies and actions proposed in the EGPRSP
reflected a significant departure from Moldova’s 200 1 Economic Revival Program. These
circumstances raised concern about the GoM’s commitment to the reform program articulated in
the EGPRSP.
6.
The CAS prescribed a cautious approach and mainly supported interventions at the
local community level in areas with the highest concentration of poverty-including rural
areas and small cities. By design, these targeted interventions were intended to address the
needs in one or more o f the three interrelated pillars for development defined by the CAS:

Promoting competitive market environment, stability, and pro-poor growth
rn Minimizing social and environmental risks, building human capital, and promoting social
inclusion
Combating corruption and improving public sector governance
rn

.

34 For more discussion o f the linkages between Moldova’s development strategy and the MDGs, see the EGPRSP
(Section 5.3).

58

These pillars organized the priorities differently than the main themes for development identified
in the EGPRSP, but this approach was designed precisely to ensure better that Moldova’s
medium-termdevelopment objectives could be achieved.
7.
Each of the CAS pillars was designated strategically to further the goals set forth in
the EGPRSP. The first CAS pillar supported the GoM’s effort to eliminate the bottlenecks to
growth by attaching a high priority to improving the business environment and investment
climate. The second pillar promoted human development and called for selected interventions to
focus directly on helping Moldova achieve i t s MDGs, including efforts to improve the quality
and access o f social services for education, health, social protection, and community
infrastructure. The third CAS pillar honored the objective o f the EGPRSP to “establish a
modern, efficient public administration system, which will strengthen democratic processes and
the market economy.” This imperative for good governance was perhaps best summed up in the
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) which was completed the following year: “Good
governance i s fundamental for economic growth. An effective state must ensure an attractive
and stable investment climate and allocate scarce resources efficiently and equitably. Failure to
deliver services in an efficient and transparent manner increases the risk o f corruption and
reduces the credibility o f public policy in the eyes o f citizens and investors alike.”
Moldova’s Progress Towards Achieving Development Goals

8.
The country context has changed dramatically during the CAS period, and the new
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) will be developed under much different circumstances
than this CAS was. At the start in FY05, the Bank’s country portfolio followed a Base Case
lending scenario that provided only investment operations. However, the CAS also contained a
series o f key reform benchmarks that would provide the basis for evaluating reform in critical
areas. These benchmarks provided triggers for a High Case lending scenario to leave open the
possibility for resuming policy based lending. At the time o f the CAS Progress Report, the G o M
had accomplished or substantially accomplished most o f the reform benchmarks that were
established as High Case triggers-allowin
for a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)
program to be implemented starting in FY07.8 5
9.
The Annual Evaluation Report (AER) prepared by the GoM (2006), the CAS
Progress Report, the PRSC program documents, and project ICRs all provide evidence o f
notable progress towards Moldova’s longer term development goals. Moldova has increased
the stability o f i t s macroeconomic framework-with generally strong growth, reduced poverty,
and significant reductions in debt. The G o M has also improved the management o f public
finances, launched a significant reform program for public administration, and improved i t s
partnerships with the international donor community to increase the flow o f aid.

10.
However, progress has been mixed for a core set o f indicators linked to the MDGs.
While the AER identified more than 150 indicators through which to monitor EGPRSP progress,
the Joint Staff Advisory Note to the EGPRSP highlighted selected indicators tied to the MDGs

Moldova’s CAS was one o f the last to contain explicit lending scenarios. The IDA14 resource allocation process
specifies that country allocations are determined annually through IDA’Sperformance-based allocation system,
which superseded the CAS indicative lending scenarios. The implications o f the transition away from CAS lending
scenarios for Moldova i s explored in the section on Bank performance (Section IV).

that the strategy's medium-term objectives aimed to achieve. These indicators are shown in
Table 1. Moldova did experience strong economic growth, exceeding the target for GDP growth
until 2006 when external shocks slowed the economy (discussed more in the next section on
CAS outcomes). Also, while poverty was reduced overall, a troubling trend emerged after 2003,
with poverty in the rural areas increasing between 2004 and 2005. Progress within the health
sector has included decreases in the under-5 and maternal mortality rates which have exceeded
the targets. Although the incidence o f HIV-AIDS remains well above the target level for 2006,
the increase in new cases diagnosed reflects improvements in detection, with increased testing
identifying previously undiagnosed infections. Education reform has advanced more slowly than
planned (discussed more in the next section on CAS outcomes).

Overall, a review o f all EGPRSP indicators and other evidence o f progress identified
11.
some key issues that pose remaining challenges for the new CPS:

.

Vulnerability to external shocks: Moldovan exports remain concentrated in a few commodities
and are susceptible to weather hazards (2007 drought) and embargos (2006 ban on wine by
Russia). The country also imports nearly all o f i t s energy and i s vulnerable to international
price fluctuations. These factors have all dampened economic growth.

.

Poverty in the rural areas: Rural households are increasingly impoverished due to the lack o f
access to public services, the recent drought, and market distortions that have reduced farmgate prices and thus affected the incomes o f farmers.

60

.

The need for increased foreign and domestic investment: The GoM has a mixed track record
for economic and structural reforms. An improved business environment and enhanced
competitiveness are needed to sustain economic growth.

.Massive emigration: A large portion o f Moldova’s working population live abroad to avail
themselves o f better economic opportunities. These migrants are generally young, educated,
and skilled. A better investment climate i s needed to create opportunities that would bring this
population home and reduce emigration.

111. CAS OUTCOMES
12.
Performance under the FY05 CAS has been satisfactory. .The country team has
worked to strengthen the results focus o f the country program during the CAS period, and a key
product o f this effort has been the Moldova Results Scorecard.36Although this tool i s s t i l l being
refined, it provides a useful summary assessment o f the performance o f IDA assistance under
this CAS. The outcomes that the Bank expected to influence and the corresponding results
scores are shown in Table 2.

13.
The following paragraphs provide a narrative explanation o f CAS achievements under
each pillar, their contribution to longer-term development goals, and the steps that are planned to
address shortcomings. Various examples illustrate how the mix o f lending and advisory services
have allowed Bank staff to work effectively with client counterparts and other donors to build
country systems and achieve results. Other examples highlight areas where results have not yet
been achieved, often for multiple reasons. The GoM does not always speak with one voice, so
an initiative could be championed by one ministry or official and then impeded by another. The
capacity o f country systems or line ministries i s s t i l l limited for implementing projects in some
cases. Implications stemming from the turnover o f Bank team leaders and bureaucratic
processes must be reviewed to avoid any disruptions to the dialogue between the Bank and the
GoM. Finally, the establishment o f a new strategy or a new law-the main focus o f the PRSC
program-is a potentially critical step for sustainable change, but such accomplishments have
often not yet yielded results during the CAS period. Rather than exploring the results o f every
activity pursued under this CAS, this section focuses on each main country outcome and
explores the degree to which IDA assistance yielded results linked to this outcome. A l i s t o f
CAS results i s presented in the appendix along with the planned lending activities and advisory
services and the actual deliveries.
Pillar I: Competitive Market Environment, Stability, and Pro-poor Growth

14.
During the preparation o f this CAS, the consultations with the business community, the
Trade Diagnostic Study, and the Investment Climate Assessment all indicated that the high cost
o f doing business constrained private sector development and job creation. The first CAS pillar
called for a broad, crosscutting approach to improve the infrastructure for investment and
economic activity, simplify bureaucratic controls and licensing procedures, streamline
enforcement, improve corporate governance, and support the development o f the rural economy
where most o f the poor live. The resulting mix o f interventions supported by IDA to further the
country outcomes linked to this pillar i s shown in Table 3.
Outcome I.
1: Stable Macroeconomic Framework
15.
T h e macroeconomic framework currently in place i s satisfactory. The G o M has
maintained a prudent fiscal stance during the CAS period, with fiscal surpluses in 2003-2006 and
a limited budget deficit target o f 0.5 percent in 2008. IDA support has played an important role
by providing advisory services and assisting with the establishment o f a credible strategy for
dealing with arrears on external debt (the May 2006 agreement with Paris Club creditors). This
ability to reschedule debt has alleviated short-term liquidity difficulties and provided access to
resources for addressing development needs.
16.
Moldova experienced strong economic growth from 2001 through 2005, with real GDP
growth averaging 7.1 percent. However, since 2006, natural gas prices have more than doubled,
imports o f Moldovan wine were banned by Russia, and the Moldova agricultural sector was hit
by a severe drought. The growth o f real GDP slowed in 2006 to 4.8 percent and with the impact
o f the drought, growth slowed further in 2007 to 4.0 percent. Given the severity o f these shocks,
the economy has proved to be quite resilient and growth i s expected to rebound sharply in 20082009.
17.
Although the country’s economic performance has been positive under this CAS, this
report highlights factors that could slow growth and poverty reduction and impede or erode

62

international competitiveness. It must be noted therefore that any review o f the current
macroeconomic framework should include an assessment o f the other outcomes desired under
Pillar I.

Outcome 1.2: ReducedN P V o f Public and Publicly Guaranteed Debt

18.
Moldova’s debt outlook i s favorable, with a low risk o f debt distress. External public
and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt, excluding debt o f state-owned enterprises, has sharply
decreased under this CAS, from a baseline o f 53 percent o f GDP in 2003 to an estimated 20
percent at the end o f 2007. This level o f PPG debt places Moldova well below the debt distress
threshold o f 40 percent (net present value o f GDP) for countries with Moldova’s Country
Performance Indicator Assessment (CPIA) overall score.
19.
The rapid decline o f PPG debt has been supported by the prudent fiscal policy, strong
economic growth, and favorable debt rescheduling operations noted above under outcome I.
1. In

63

addition, the G o M has maintained policies that did not allow the debt situation to deteriorate
despite severe external shocks. Commitments by the Consultative Group and the Millennium
Challenge Corporation have demonstrated improved prospects for donor assistance which have,
in turn, bolstered debt sustainability. In short, progress reducing PPG debt has created the
opportunity for additional borrowing for infrastructure and other high priority development
projects.
20.
While the PPG debt reduction achieved under this CAS is notable, this success should be
considered within the context o f continuing risks. In particular, any interruption o f remittance
inflows could affect the sustainability o f debt given the ongoing reliance o f the economy on
workers living abroad. This dynamic underscores the importance o f improving the investment
climate to enhance domestic sources o f growth.
Outcome 1.3: Inflation in Single Digits
21.
High inflation remains a concern in Moldova, and a renewed effort i s needed to
reduce inflation below 10 percent. Although the target for inflation control was not achieved
during this CAS period, IDA assistance effectively supported the G o M in remaining current on
budgetary obligations. The significant increase in energy prices since mid-2005 and the impact
o f the drought on domestic food prices have impeded the efforts o f the National Bank o f
Moldova to reduce inflation. The CPI increased 12 percent in 2007, above the 10 percent target
established in this CAS. In the current context, disinflation will require ongoing tight monetary
policy and a more rapid increase in domestic productivity.
Outcome 1.4: Financially and Socially Viable Pension System
22.
Significant progress has been achieved towards reforming the pension system, but
more work remains to be done. Through the support provided by the Social Protection
Management Project and the Pension Policy Dialogue, the general pension law (1999) to reform
the pay-as-you-go pension system has met the short-term objectives o f making pension payments
on time, in-cash (as opposed to in-kind), and without the need for budget transfers. The system
has increased transparency-with
international accounting standards introduced and
implemented and regular financial audits conducted (1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006).
The National Social Insurance House has also made progress establishing and populating a
database with individual records to allow for the calculation o f pensions based on individual
contributions.
23.
Despite these advances, pension benefits in Moldova are not yet based reliably on actual
contributions paid. In some cases, G o M laws or policies have impeded Moldova’s success in
reforming the pension system. For example, employers have the responsibility to pay
contributions on behalf o f the employee, but the recent law on contribution amnesty created
incentives for employers not to comply. The G o M has also not yet successfully eliminated
pension privileges, but the Ministry o f Social Protection, Family and Child has drafted a
unification strategy for all categories o f contributors/pensioners.
24.
Bank staff have identified threats to the sustainability o f the pension system and rated the
risk to the development outcome as substantial for the Social Protection Management Project
(closed March 3 1, 2007). Key considerations in this assessment were the contribution amnesty
law, the long-term financial sustainability o f the pension system, and the limited capacity o f the
ministry for policy analysis and monitoring and evaluation on social protection issues. A major
64

,

factor affecting ministry capacity has been staff turnover due to l o w remuneration (see outcome
111.1).
25.
Establishing a financially and socially viable pension system i s critical for sustained
economic growth and poverty reduction, as noted in the section on social insurance in the
EGPRSP. The Bank’s Moldova country team envisions that the PRSC-3 will provide critical
support to build on achievements made to date. In particular, this budget support will focus on
establishing individual accounts for 100 percent o f all pension contributors; unifying the pension
system for all categories o f pensioners (non-agricultural, agricultural, and privileged) and
achieving further progress in linking benefits to contributions.
Outcome 1.5: Conditions Created for Increased Domestic and Foreign Investment through
Reduced Cost o f Doing Business and Improved Trade Facilitation

26.

The investment climate has improved during this CAS period, but notable risks and
barriers must still be addressed. The reform benchmarks established as triggers for the
original high case CAS had all been fully accomplished at the time o f the CAS Progress Report
(September 2006). Moldova has simplified business registration and licensing procedures and
reduced the number o f licenses and documents required for business registration.
Comprehensive review o f all normative acts (by-laws) was conducted (the so-called Guillotine I
exercise), resulting in the removal o f a large number o f obsolete and/or redundant regulations.
Continued collaboration between the country team and the G o M via the Competitiveness
Enhancement Project aims at further streamlining the business environment. The L a w on the
Basic Principles o f State Regulation o f Entrepreneurial Activity (Law 235) was passed in July
2006 and included a series o f transitional provisions to (i)conduct a comprehensive review o f
existing legislation (Guillotine 11) and (ii)build capacity for applying Regulatory Impact
Assessment (RIA) methodology to new legislation Guillotine I1 has resulted in proposed
amendments to more than 100 laws, with the draft legislative package currently under discussion
by Parliament. Starting in March 2008, RIA has become mandatory for all new legislation
affecting business operations.

27.
A sound basis for financial reporting and auditing in the corporate sector according to EU
law and international practices has also been established for Moldova. Following the Report on
the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) for accounting and auditing in FY04 and
follow-up activities provided or supported by the Bank, the G o M passed new accounting and
auditing laws in 2007 that went into effect in 2008. H o w to implement this legislation in practice
remains a challenge for Moldova, and currently, the G o M i s working with Bank assistance to
prepare the country’s strategy and action plan for strengthening corporate sector financial
reporting.
28.
The Trade Diagnostic Study implemented at the start o f this CAS period highlighted a
number o f problems with operation o f the Moldova Customs Service (MCS) related to inefficient
and costly border procedures. Under the Trade and Transport Facilitation in South East Europe
project, the M C S has improved i t s performance and implemented an automated system for
customs data to expedite processing. This system has served an important role in promoting
export competitiveness and allowing domestic firms to participate in global production networks
(see B o x 1).
29.

Notable progress has been achieved in Moldova’s financial sector during the CAS

65

period-including remarkable growth in credit (50 percent year over year in 2007 alone) and
deposits. The decreasing spreads in borrowing
and lending rates and the increasing competition

innovation by f i r m s and farmers. During the CAS
period, domestic fixed capital formation increased
from 18.6 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 28.4 percent in 2006-above the CAS target o f 22 percent
set for 2008.
Despite this progress achieved under the CAS, Moldova s t i l l has one o f the highest
32.
regulatory compliance costs in the region, and the country’s overall global standing on the ease
o f doing business has declined substantially in 2007 from 8Sth to 103‘d (Doing Business 2007).
This signals remaining inefficiencies in Moldova’s business environment.

33.
Agriculture i s still one o f the largest real sectors o f the economy, but Moldovan farmers
are generally receiving less for their outputs and paying more for their inputs relative to
international parity prices than they should. This constrains farmers’ incomes and decreases
returns to factors such as land and labor. In short, policy distortions and market imperfections
continue to result in economic transfers from the farm sector and obscure agriculture’s potential.
While it i s common for agricultural production to decline as a share o f GDP as economies
develop, it should continue to grow in absolute terms. This i s not happening in Moldova, and
the Bank has not focused any activities on directly supporting increased competitiveness or
natural hazard mitigation in the agricultural sector over the latest CAS period.
34.
In summary, these select details demonstrate how conditions have improved for domestic
and foreign investment but also highlight areas for continued improvement. The country team
expects key investment lending and budget support to play important complementary roles going
forward. The PRSC i s a cross-sectoral instrument that fosters high-level dialogue and brings
weight to regulatory reform. However, the G o M can not yet meet PRSC triggers without
support. The individual projects remain critical for building G o M capacity to enhance or achieve
specific results on the ground.

66

Outcome 1.6: Arrested Deterioration o f Transportation Infrastructure
Preliminary steps have been taken to implement a strategy for the road sector,
35.
including the rehabilitation o f roads. Under the CAS, the main Bank support for the
transportation infrastructure focused on increasing awareness o f the constraints that impede
competitiveness through extensive ESW. With public investment remaining very l o w (less than
2 percent o f GDP), the roads continued to deteriorate with negative implications for growth. The
country team has recognized this omission in the CAS and the Road Sector Program Support
Project has recently become effective. This project i s expected to reduce road user costs in the
longer term by improving the condition and quality o f the road network and by increasing the
capacity o f the State Road Administration to manage, maintain, and rehabilitate the road network
in an efficient and transparent manner.

36.
Bank staff have been actively engaged with G o M counterparts and other development
partners in designing a Land Transport Infrastructure Strategy including a 10-year Investment
and Expenditure Plan covering road, rail, and urban transport infrastructure. Following the
Government’s request, the Bank also helped the G o M to prepare a large-scale Road Sector
Program which i s to be financed jointly by the G o M and at least five different external partners.
The Bank’s share i s contributed through the Road Sector Program Support Project which became
effective in 2007. The process which has taken place in the Transport Sector has been
considered as a model that could also apply to other infrastructure operations. However, the
continued coordination o f International Finance Institutions i s critical and the absorptive capacity
o f the G o M and current operations should be monitored closely, in particular, with the European
Commission (EC) and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) expressing interest in
providing large additional financing to the Road Sector Program.
Outcome 1.7: Improved Energy Efficiency and Reduced Energy Vulnerability
37.
Targeted improvements in energy efficiency have been achieved, but the need to
reduce energy vulnerability became increasingly urgent during the CAS period. Project
activities achieved significant savings b y implementing energy efficient technologies to upgrade
metering, support more reliable operation o f the transmission system, and reduce the rate o f
outages o f the high-voltage transmission lines and substations. The availability o f heating in
selected buildings has increased from 30 to 120 days a year, and the number o f buildings
connected to heating has exceeded the output indicators. These improvements in the energy
infrastructure have yielded social welfare results on the ground which undoubtedly contribute to
other CAS outcomes (see Box 2).
38.
As noted in the CAS Progress Report, the issue o f energy vulnerability gained
prominence with higher international o i l prices and the sharp increase in the price o f natural gas
from $80 in 2005 to $253 per thousand cubic meters in July 2008, with additional price increases
phased in until they reach market (Le. EU) levels by 201 1, Energy sector reforms allowed for
domestic gas tariffs to increase by 70 percent between February 2006 and February 2007 as a
response to this price increase, thereby significantly reducing the demand for gas as the cost i s
passed on to consumers. However, tariffs in the district heating sector (dominated by the stateowned Termocom supplying heat in Chisinau) remain below cost recovery levels and are
resulting in growing arrears to energy producers. These across-the-board subsidies for both rich
and poor are not equitable and are underminingthe financial viability o f the sector.

67

has made it possible to suppl

Clinical Hospital and the Institute for Oncology, with hot water and steam.

39.
The PRSC program i s addressing energy vulnerability issues-particularly focusing on
reducing Moldova's energy intensity, maintaining or improving financial discipline in the sector,
pursuing further cost recovery o f energy tariffs for all categories o f consumers, and addressing
poverty and social implications. The GoM has met a key benchmark for the PRSC-2 by
adopting a new Energy Strategy (July 2007) to establish a reform path for legal, regulatory, and
technical harmonization o f the Moldova energy sector with the EU internal energy market, and
specifically the Energy Community Treaty (ETC).
Outcome 1.8: Strengthened Property Rights and Improved Access to Finance, Knowledge, and
Technology in Rural Areas

40.

A unified national real estate cadastre system for urban and rural land has been
established, and the credit and technical assistance provided to private farmers has
exceeded CAS targets. The security o f tenure and ownership rights in Moldova has increased,
with 75% o f rural property in private hands having been fully registered. The average income in
the businesses in the areas covered by the first Rural Investment and Services Project (RISP-1)
increased by 23 percent over the project period, and 194 new businesses were created in rural
areas under RISP-2 during 2006-2007.
41.
Although these project interventions have had promising results, the Bank has not yet
developed a strategy for more comprehensively dealing with the various bottlenecks in the
agricultural sector. Agriculture has underperformed overall economic growth, and this trend has
contributed to increasing poverty in the rural areas since 2003 (see outcome 11.1 below). Public
services and investment in the sector remain inadequate, including measures to reduce
vulnerability to natural hazards. Only limited IDA resources have focused on the agricultural
sector and on improving access to finance, knowledge, and technology in rural areas under this
CAS, but the opportunity exists going forward to leverage this funding in partnership with other
donors offering considerable funding (particularly SIDA and MCC) to achieve the desired
outcomes.

Pillar II: Minimize Social and Environmental Risks, Build Human Capital, and Promote
Social Inclusion

42.
The CAS supported actions to strengthen human, social, and physical capital, recognizing
that this was critical for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. IDA assistance focused on
improving the targeting o f social assistance, the access o f the poor to public services, and critical
infrastructure such as public utilities. The mix o f lending and non-lending activities provided to
promote outcomes within this pillar i s shown in Table 4. Given that the CAS pillars and the
associated outcomes are often interrelated, these lists overlap at times with those o f the other
pillars.

Outcome 11.1: Reduced Poverty Rates Among Rural Residents and Vulnerable and Excluded
Groups
43.
Social assistance remains poorly targeted, and the poverty rate among rural
households has increased since 2003. The Moldova Poverty Update (June 2006) reported l i t t l e
progress in reducing poverty since 2002 despite vigorous growth o f the GDP. This trend appears
to be largely due to the evolution o f relative prices: Moldovan farmers’ real wages fell as the
prices they received for the products remained flat and the prices o f inputs (e.g., wage labor and
diesel fuel) increased (see outcome 1.5). In addition, multiple social assistance programs have
suffered leakage to middle and upper income groups.
44.
Ongoing portfolio activities (Health Services and Social Assistance, the PRSC Program,
Poverty and Social Impact Analysis, etc.) are being pursued to effectively reduce poverty rates.
In 2007, the G o M approved a social support law to improve the targeting o f social assistance

69

benefits and this law was approved by Parliament in June 2008. The new system, which
commenced in October 2008, establishes a single benefit directed to the poorest 10 percent o f
Moldovans. A consolidated database o f beneficiaries o f social assistance i s in the design phase
and i s expected to be in place by the fall o f 2009. These measures should increase the
government’s capacity to assess the impact and effectiveness o f social assistance over time and
better ensure that the poor and vulnerable have access to these programs.

Outcome 11.2: Higher Oualitv o f Education and Improved Access to Education Services in Line
with MDGs

45.

Significant challenges remain related to the quality o f and access to education in
Moldova, but progress i s underway with education reform. The IDA package has provided a
m i x of relevant knowledge management and policy dialogue initiatives and financial assistance
and lending activities during the CAS period. The evidence i s inconclusive as to whether
education quality or access has increased as a result to date. This status appears to be due to a
combination o f inadequate indicators to assess Bank performance and limited capacity o f the
Ministry o f Education and Youth for project implementation and change management. Projects
have provided new textbooks and curricula (General Education project) and rehabilitated
facilities (Social Investment Fund 1 and 2) largely as planned, but indicators have focused on
these outputs (implementation milestones) rather than on whether this has resulted in improved
quality or access. The Quality Education in Rural Areas o f Moldova project i s expected to
improve access to education services and will measure quality through Baccalaureate results
achieved by urban and rural students.

46.
Moldova lags behind on reforms in education and the current system is inequitable and
inefficient in the allocation o f resources. The G o M has undertaken a school mapping exercise to
provide information for resource planning and drafted a Strategy for the Optimization o f the
School Network (both PRSC program triggers). These steps, coupled with new and ongoing
activities (including the new Education for All Fast Track Initiative) and improvements to
monitoring and evaluation indicators are expected to achieve this outcome.
Outcome 11.3: Better Allocation Efficiency in the Health Sector and Improved Health Indicators
in Line with MDGs
47.
IDA assistance has effectively contributed to health indicators in line with MDGs and
improved allocation efficiency in the health sector. A health insurance system was introduced in
2004 and i t s coverage increased to 75 percent since 2006. The G o M has emphasized more costefficient service delivery in primary care settings and has spent more on primary care through
IDA assistance and other donor funding. The infant, under-5, and maternal mortality rates have
been decreasing. HIV/AIDS incidence continues to increase, but at a steadily decreasing rate. To
some degree, the rate o f HIV/AIDS infection has been artificially inflated due to improved
testing procedures which are detecting previously undiagnosed cases. In fact, the AIDS Control
project i s a good example o f concrete human development results achieved through IDA
assistance (see Box 3).

13.3% in 2002

Treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has been made available for patients
from all over the country, including Transnistria, and to the prison population. The total number of
PLWHA who started HAART treatment is 549 (including 19 children, and 530 adults) from both the
civilian and prison sectors. These services are delivered in cooperation with the GFATM,
mortatity has decreased

48.
Health reform i s a long-term agenda. The original aims o f equitable coverage o f the
country with good quality primary care must s t i l l be met-with some inefficiency remaining in
the hospital sector and the number o f vacant positions for family practitioners in rural health
centers remaining continuously high. In addition, although the GoM contributes to health
insurance for the non-working population, there i s s t i l l considerable risk o f poverty due to the
cost o f illness among the rural population and the self-employed.
Despite these continuing needs, there has been notable progress in the health sector
49.
during this CAS period. The Ministry o f Health has led the process to develop an approved
reform strategy, demonstrating the initiative and capacity to set policy and collaborating with
donors to gain support for the overall health strategy through a consolidated donor program. The
Health Services and Social Assistance project i s part o f this consolidated support, and the Bank
expects to continue working effectively with the M o H and with donors to further increase equity
and efficiency in the health sector.

71

Outcome 11.4: Improved Access to and Quality o f Water and Sanitation Services and Reduced
Environmental Degradation and Health Hazards

50.
Bank support has been instrumental in improving the supply and quality o f water in
targeted areas and in removing persistent organic pollutants. The Pilot Water Supply and
Sanitation Project has delivered results to Moldovans in five towns-meeting or exceeding CAS
targets (see Box 4). The improved water supply has been accompanied by increasing collection
rates by the utilities (now averaging 92 percent in the pilot areas), boosting their financial
performance and better ensuring the sustainability o f project outcomes.

Five Moldovan towns with a al population of about 250,000 benefited from the improved safety and
sustainability of the water supply and sanitation services. The centralized water supply and sanitation

Other activities have also notably contributed to improved water supply and
environmental conditions-particularly through the collection, treatment, and use o f agricultural
waste (both as fertilizer and as renewable energy). The Soil Conservation Project has succeeded
in afforesting 21,000 hectares o f degraded land (see Box 5). IDA assistance i s focused on
protecting the environment and human health by safely managing and disposing stockpiles o f
persistent organic pollutants (POPS) and PCBs. While the performance o f this project has been
satisfactory thus far, significant delays on sub-components related to the establishment o f a
modern chemical management system could jeopardize the project development objective. This
warrants greater attention to project management and technical assistance issues to ensure that

Project activities supported the afforestation of about 21,000 hectares of degraded lands. The project

Pillar 111. Combating Corruption and Improving Public Sector Governance

52.
Moldova inherited weak institutions. Excessive regulations, bureaucratic discretion, and
associated corruption affect the competitiveness o f the economy, put downward pressure on
wage rates, and drive people either to emigrate or to j o i n the shadow economy. Activities under
this CAS, shown in Table 5, aimed to facilitate the transparent and efficient management o f
public funds, strengthen the civil service system, reform the judicial system, empower local
governments, and increase the engagement o f civil society in decisions for creating sustainable
growth and reducing poverty.
Outcome 111.1: Increased Capacity o f Public Sector to Develop and Implement Public Policies

53.

A foundation for building capacity in the public sector has been established through
a strategy for reforming public administration. Under the PRSC program, the GoM has
drafted a Civil Service L a w to classify and grade civil service positions and link pay with
professional development and performance. In April, 2008, a C i v i l Service Management Unit
was established to implement this reform, and the law was adopted by the Parliament in
November 2008. .

Outcome 111.2: Lower Public Perception o f Corruption in Government and Increased
Transparency and Accountability in the Management o f Public Monies.

54.
IDA assistance has facilitated and supported continuous improvements to the
annual Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and increased competition in
public procurement. The Bank has aided Moldova in strengthening i t s resource allocation
processes through the MTEF and expanding the sectors included to respond to the EGPRSP. An
internal financial control and audit system based on European Union standards has been
developed. The G o M has established a central policy unit to allow for political consensus on
policies and to help ensure that the budget i s an effective anti-poverty and development policy
instrument. These steps, combined with increased competition in public procurement, are
improving both transparency and accountability in the management o f public funds.
55.
Ongoing activities started under this CAS are expected to contribute further to this
outcome. For example, the PRSC program i s promoting improvement in public investment
management processes, so that externally financed projects, centralized investments, and other
sources o f public investment are integrated into a single common public investment program
with clear processes for prioritization and implementation (including economic feasibility
studies). A strategic plan for the institutional development o f the Court o f Accounts has been
approved and the implementation has started. Bank projects are also focused on technical
assistance to build capacity in public administration and on court reform to reduce corruption.
56.
International measures indicate that the public perception o f corruption in Moldova has
generally declined during the CAS period. TI’S Corruption Perception Index has improved from
2.4 to 3.2 from 2003 to 2006. Many indicators in the EBRD-World Bank Business Environment
and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) also show improvement. However, there i s s t i l l
progress needed. In particular, the BEEPS data-while
largely showing a positive trendindicated that the share o f f i r m s reporting that bribes were a problem had increased from 2002 to
2005 for obtaining government contracts, influencing the content o f new legislation, and dealing
with courts. In fact, the percent o f f i r m s surveyed saying that the judiciary was a problem for
doing business increased sharply from 2002 to 2005 and was well above the level for other
countries in the region. These findings underscore the need for continued efforts to improve
public sector governance.
74

IV. BANKPERFORMANCE
Quality of Products and Services

57.
IDA performance during the CAS period has been satisfactory. IEG and Q A G
evaluations and other internal measures o f quality indicate that the quality o f Bank products and
services in Moldova has been improving, and there have been no projects at risk since FY05. The
only project evaluated by the Qualit Assurance Group for Quality at Entry in 2004-2007
(Energy-2) had a satisfactory rating.
Out o f six projects that closed during the CAS period,
five have been reviewed by IEG and rated as satisfactory. In addition, the recent ISRs on active
projects suggest that all are on track to meet their development objectives.

’‘

58.
The Bank’s Moldova Country Team has demonstrated a results orientation for
maintaining and improving the quality o f products and services, continually working to
strengthen the indicators for monitoring and evaluation. As noted earlier, the team has
recently adopted the use o f the Moldova CAS Results Scorecard to assess better the contribution
o f CAS activities to desired country outcomes. The 2006 Country Program Review noted that
the quality o f the results frameworks for individual projects overall has been good, with clear,
concise, realistic, and measurable indicators that are consistent with projects’ development
objectives. Additionally, Moldova received the highest score for results among E C A countries
in the 2007 ISR review conducted by the E C A Quality Group.

59.
The Bank has used analytic and advisory work (AAA) effectively during the CAS
period to complement investment projects and the PRSC. The CEM, poverty update,
advisory work on agriculture, and the business environment surveys have directly informed the
development o f the PRSC Program. The Public Expenditure Review (PER) in 2007 was closely
linked to policy notes in health and education to allow for a broader review and to ensure
adequate sector specific input. As noted in the section on CAS outcomes, analytical work has
also been mainstreamed into other areas o f engagement, such as agriculture, social assistance,
and improved access to health and education. The country team and other stakeholders
continually provide input to identify analytic gaps and develop strategies for addressing them;
for example, a current focus i s on the need to better understand the drivers for economic growth
and how these relate to poverty reduction-particularly for rural populations.
60.
The PRSC was developed with strategic links to the investment program and in
close coordination with other donors. Investment operations provide significant technical
assistance to enable the implementation o f policy reforms supported by the PRSC program. A
number o f other donor programs are aligned behind the PRSC: for PRSC1, the limited IDA
resources ($10 million) leveraged nearly $7 million from other donors. PRSC2 will also have
substantial donor financing.
61.
Plans for implementing products and services have been adjusted to strengthen
results based on portfolio experiences, GoM initiatives, and opportunities for leveraging

37

Quality measured through QAG includes quality at entry, quality o f supervision and quality o f ESW
assessments (the latter two types o f assessments were not completed for Moldova projects during the CAS
period). Other internal measures include IEG reviews o f projects, ISRs, the internal review o f results
frameworks as part o f the 2006 Country Portfolio Review, and a review o f the ISRs conducted by ECA
Quality Group in 2007.

75

resources provided by other donors. A road sector project was added in FY07 to provide
much needed financing for infrastructure. Concerns that emerged from the AER promoted more
focus on the limited effectiveness o f public expenditure, the uneven poverty reduction, and
public sector governance. Harmonization between the EGPRSP and the EU-Moldova Action
Plan (EMAP) and the growing support o f donors for working within this framework have created
opportunities for coordination in such areas as AIDS treatment and prevention and social
assistance pilots among others.

62.

The IDA-IMF partnership in Moldova’s development strategy has been excellent
over the past few years. Bank and IMF staffs have executed joint work and have continued to
carry out joint missions at least twice a year for macroeconomic policy dialogue with the
Government. The IMF policy dialogue with the GoM takes place in the context o f the ongoing
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, covering the 2006-2008 period. The PRSC was
prepared in conjunction with the PRGF to ensure the consistency o f the macroeconomic and
structural policy reforms supported by both programs. The IMF i s taking the lead on
macroeconomic issues while IDA takes the lead on structural and social issues. In a number o f
areas where the mandates o f the two institutions overlap, such as public finance, the work i s
being closely coordinated to ensure that consistent advice i s provided to the authorities. The
existence o f an I M F program i s an important input for the determination o f the adequacy o f the
macroeconomic policy framework for the PRSC.

63.
Continued efforts are needed to deepen collaboration within the World Bank
Group. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has remained active in Moldova,
supporting power, telecommunications, agribusiness, small and medium enterprises, and local
banks. Building on IDA’Sefforts in the health and infrastructure sectors, IFC w i l l collaborate
and complement IDA’S work with public private partnership initiatives. In addition, the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) i s active in Moldova, covering part o f a
large-scale power sector privatization effort that has been supported by IFC. M I G A i s open to
opportunities to support foreign direct investment in Moldova through the provision o f political
risk guarantees and will coordinate i t s involvement with IDA.
Portfolio Assessment
64.
Portfolio quality has been steadily improving over the CAS period. As shown in
Table 6, the percentage o f commitments at risk has been reduced from 23.5 in 2004 to 0 since
2005. The disbursement ratio has been relatively high, averaging 22 percent despite the young
portfolio age (currently, the average project age i s 2.4 years).

The portfolio i s dominated by projects in the infrastructure and human
development sectors. As o f December 2008, IDA lending operations include a PRSC program
and 10 investment operations (with an additional 3 GEF projects), for a total commitment o f
US$159.3 million, o f which US$100.4 million (63%) remains to be disbursed. All IDA and GEF
operations currently under implementation are proceeding well, with none in problem status or at
risk.
66.
Investment loans foreseen in the CAS for FY05 (under IDA13), FY06, FY07, and
FYO8 were approved as planned. They included 6 investment operations in support o f public
financial management, competitiveness, education in rural areas, rural investment services,
health care and social assistance, road sector support, and supplemental financing for the
Cadastre project. Additional operations were also approved, including a project to help Moldova
combat the threat o f avian influenza in FY06 and a National Water Facility in FY08. Moldova
used all o f its IDA allocation during the CAS period.
67.
However, the volume o f loans delivered and the focus o f lending and non-lending
activities were different at times than what was originally envisaged in the CAS. The
difference between planned lending and actual deliveries i s explained by Moldova's successful
progress meeting High Case triggers and adjustments in the Bank's program in response to
changing country circumstances. These modifications were made to ensure coherence with the
PRSC program, provide flexible financing in response to the new government's priorities in
infrastructure (roads) and to adhere to the new performance-based allocations (PBA) IDA
envelope. The full l i s t o f planned versus actual lending and non-lending activities i s in the
appendix (Tables 2 and 3).
68.
The transition away from CAS lending scenarios to the PBA approach presented
difficulties both for reaching a shared understanding with the GoM and for planning
lending operations to stay on track. Moldova qualified for the High Case lending scenario but
no longer had access to this level o f support under the PBA system. Improvements in portfolio
performance and in Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings in FY06 led to
an increase in the allocation for FY07 and FY08, but this amount was s t i l l below the originally
foreseen High Case level. This transition appears to be a major reason why the program has been

77

implemented with delays-about
behind their original timelines.

half o f the activities have slipped at least one fiscal year

69.
The portfolio has included a high number o f projects relative to the size o f the I D A
allocation, and the associated cost o f supervision has limited the resources available for
ESW and TA. The results scorecard exercise included a review o f operational efficiency and
effectiveness and identified that the cost o f supervision for the Moldova portfolio was
substantially higher than for other ECA countries on average. For example, supervision for
activities in Moldova required 52 percent o f the total country services in FY07, compared to 35
percent for ECA countries on average. During the same time period, 10 percent o f country
services in Moldova supported ESW and only 6 percent supported TA, compared to 20 percent
and 12 percent for ECA overall.
Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination

70.
The Bank has strengthened its relationship with the GoM during the CAS period.
Government authorities have demonstrated their commitment to economic reform by
implementing the changes called for under the High Case lending scenario, adopting EUMoldova Action Plan (2005), and working to build country systems. Among others, such
systems have included a public debt management function, basic information systems for budget
execution, and a national Court o f Accounts to act as the supreme financial control institution in
the country. Although government authorities have not always shared a unified view regarding
the means to a specific development objective, Bank staff have succeeded in fostering effective
dialogue with client counterparts to achieve results.
71,
The development o f the upcoming CPS will rely on a consultative process. The
country team regularly reaches out to stakeholders to inform them o f lending and advisory
activities and to receive their input. For example, the World Bank Moldova Country Office has
recently hosted roundtable discussions with the media, think tanks, and other stakeholders on
migration and remittances, doing business, youth and energy. The GoM has recently
implemented a highly consultative process in establishing i t s National Development Strategy,
and the country team expects to follow a similar process in developing the CPS.
Although I D A lending and advisory services represent only a minor share o f official
72.
development assistance (ODA) each year, the Bank plays a pivotal role in coordinating aid.
The Bank’s leadership in convening donors was exemplified by the Consultative Group meeting
in Brussels in December 2006. This meeting, hosted jointly by the World Bank and the
European Commission (EC), brought together the GoM and international partners to confirm
commitment to the country’s reform program and development agenda and to identify additional
external financing in response to recent external shocks. Currently, the Bank’s Moldova
portfolio includes US$61 million in.active grants from trust funds. There has been particularly
close collaboration with the EC and several bilateral donors (UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands)
in the preparation o f the PRSC. The section on CAS outcomes cites examples o f where Bank
staff work with other donors on individual lending operations or analytical work. Efforts to
advance harmonization and donor coordination have resulted in several donors signing the
Development Partnership Framework (2006), and Bank staff often have the opportunity or
responsibility to mobilize other donors’ resources to address national priorities and to provide a
predictable flow o f aid. This role for the Bank in Moldova could become increasingly important
as the aid from other donors increases.

78

V. LESSONS
LEARNED
73.
Targeted support plays an important role in building country systems, enhancing
ministry capacity, and enabling the development and implementation o f longer term
policies and strategies.
Numerous examples have highlighted the contribution o f Bank
operations to country development outcomes-xpediting
customs processing, increasing the
efficiency o f energy use, increasing the quality and supply o f water, developing a health
insurance system, and increasing the security o f ownership rights for rural property to name a
few. Specific investment operations provide valuable support to the GoM for achieving the
benchmarks mandated by the PRSC program.
Capable and committed government ministries are a critical factor in achieving
74.
development objectives. National agencies contribute effectively to the development agenda
when they have the leadership and capacity to design and implement the needed strategies and
policies. This review has highlighted cases-such as for health and transport-where agencies
have demonstrated ownership o f and commitment to country development outcomes. In other
examples, agencies must s t i l l develop the requisite country systems. As shown b y the
experiences in education and pension reform, weaker ministry capacity or a lack o f clear
ownership can impede development efforts and warrants more targeted intervention.

75.
Cross-sectoral approaches improve the effectiveness o f interventions. Linkages
across multiple themes can hinder development efforts that are too narrowly focused. Energy
vulnerability and access to healthcare have direct implications for social assistance programs.
Water quality and organic pollutants influence health outcomes. The weak ministry capacity
impeding pension reform i s due in part to staff turnover, an issue directly linked to the civil
service reform agenda. As described above, targeted interventions can serve an important role in
building needed country systems and facilitating longer-term government ownership, but these
operations are best planned selectively as part o f a more comprehensive development strategy.
76.
Resources from the Bank can be directed strategically to leverage those of other
by the Paris
donors for optimal development impact. Harmonizing aid-underscored
Declaration (2005) and the Development Partnership Framework (2006)-has been a key theme
during this CAS period, and consolidated donor support has been instrumental in furthering
development outcomes. Resources from other organizations have greatly augmented available
IDA assistance-in health, transport, public administration reform, and in the PRSC program to
name a few examples. The Bank has developed effective relationships with GoM counterparts
for facilitating a constructive development dialogue and targeting resources where they are
needed, and serving this leadership role i s critical for achieving country development objectives.
The linkages between economic growth and poverty reduction are not yet

IDA assistance has contributed to a stable

macroeconomic framework and strong economic growth, and the economy has been resilient
despite severe external shocks. However, reducing poverty has proven to be a more challenging
objective, particularly for populations in rural areas. The lack o f a direct correlation between
sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction suggests an analytic gap in the Bank’s
current portfolio.

78.

Effective, efficient, and transparent public sector management i s becoming

79

increasingly important for achieving development objectives. The Bank’s portfolio in
Moldova i s currently dominated by projects in the infrastructure and human development
sectors, and there has been a strategic emphasis during this CAS period on improving the
investment climate to spur domestic productivity and foreign investment for sustainable
economic growth. All o f these development initiatives rely on sound public sector management
for resource allocation, strategy development, policy analysis, project management, and
monitoring and evaluation. The third pillar o f the CAS, Combating Corruption and Improving
Public Sector Governance, continues to gain importance with the addition o f the PRSC program,
the mainstreaming o f project implementation units, and the exploration o f sector wide
approaches.
