SUMMARY
1.
Political Developments. In August 2000, upon the signing o f the Arusha Peace
Agreement, Burundi began emerging from seven years o f brutal c i v i l war. From 2000 to
2005, the country made a successful transition to a multi-party system o f government.
Parliamentary elections, based o n a new constitution, took place in August 2005. The CNDDFDD, formerly the largest Hutu rebel group, won over 58 percent o f the vote, and parliament
elected CNDD-FDD leader Pierre Nkurunziza as president. Since 2005, political and security
progress has been mixed. There i s an opportunity for Burundi to strengthen democracy and
exit the conflict trap, but the challenges are formidable.

..

Poverty Profile and Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.
Burundi i s one o f the poorest countries in the world-about 67 percent o f the population lives
below the poverty line. Poverty i s mainly rural, and there are large regional disparities. About
63 percent o f the population suffers from food insecurity, and the country has the second
highest child malnutrition rate in Africa, a situation that could worsen due to rising food and
fuel prices. Burundi i s not likely to reach many o f the Millennium Development Goals.
11.

iii.
Economic Developments. Per capita income f e l l by almost 40 percent during the
war. Since 2000, economic performance has improved, with real GDP averaging 2.7 percent
from 2001 to 2006. Growth depends on the volatile agricultural sector, which accounts for
about half o f GDP. Coffee production, which contributes less than 5 percent to GDP but
which accounts for more than 70 percent o f export revenues, has been particularly volatile.
The economy i s dominated by public enterprises; Burundi’s private sector i s small and
constrained by an unfavorable investment climate. Burundi joined the East Africa
Community in July 2007.
iv.
Economic Prospects. Economic growth i s expected to accelerate from 3.6 percent in
2007 to 4.5 percent in 2008 and to 5 percent from 2009 to 201 1. The main driving force
behind growth remains agriculture, especially food crops, which constitute 80 percent of
agricultural GDP. Growth depends on strong agricultural reforms, better rural infrastructure,
and improvement in farm productivity. Secondary sector growth depends on increased
mining; petroleum sector reforms; and higher value-added from agro-processing, especially
coffee. Trade, transport, and telecommunications are also expected to contribute to growth.
v.
Government Strategy. The 2006 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), based
on extensive public consultations, lays the foundation for national reconciliation, economic
recovery, and an end to the cycle o f violence. I t presents four strategic priorities: (i)improve
governance and security; (ii)promote sustainable and equitable economic growth; (iii)
develop human capital; and (iv) prevent and control HIV/AIDS. The PRSP also highlights
the need to refocus the role o f the government and to give room to the private sector. The
PRSP calls for addressing gender inequalities, enhancing regional integration, building a new
partnership with donors, and strengthening institutional capacity at local and central levels;

vi.
Progress under the World Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN). Executive
Directors discussed the I S N in M a y 2005, shortly before the elected government took office.
The ISN, based on Burundi’s Interim PRSP, focused on two objectives: (i)responding to
immediate social demands by expanding access to basic social services and incomegenerating activities; and (ii)developing the foundation for sustainable growth and poverty
1

alleviation. Overall implementation o f the I S N has been satisfactory. The International
Development Association (IDA) has delivered all operations envisioned in the ISN.
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA), under the ISN, helped rebuild knowledge and
underpin reforms.
vii.
CAS Objectives and Results. The World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), based on Burundi’s PRSP, will help reinforce a medium-term vision of sustainable
development, assisting Burundi’s transition from a post-conflict economy to a
developing economy. It provides a framework for World Bank Group support for four years,
from fiscal year (FY) 2009 through FY 2012. The CAS focuses on two strategic objectives:
(i)promote sustainable and broad-based economic growth; and (ii)improve access to social
services and consolidate social stability. Governance i s a cross-cutting CAS objective. Core
principles for engagement are: selectivity, international partnership, focus on results,
governance, regional integration, and sensitivity to political economy dynamics.
viii.
Proposed CAS Program. AAA: Bank AAA will include: the HIPC Completion
Point document, petroleum sector study, financial sector assessment program (jointly with
the International Monetary Fund), country economic memorandum, public expenditure
review updates, a poverty assessment, and analytical work and technical assistance to support
E A C accession. AAA will emphasize government ownership and donor partnership to ensure
that findings are translated into actions and results. IDA-Financed Operations: The World
Bank will finance an estimated eight new projects-four
investment operations and four
development policy operations. The Bank will provide additional financing to scale up
successful interventions. In addition, the Bank will finance two to three regional operations
involving Burundi. Burundi’s total IDA allocation i s estimated at about $84 million per year,
about 25 to 30 percent o f which i s expected to be provided as budget support. International
Finance Corporation (IFC): The CAS presents the first fully articulated World Bank-IFC
strategy for Burundi. The IFC i s increasing i t s involvement in Burundi, providing advisory
services to government and businesses, and seeking investment opportunities. The World
Bank Institute will also continue to be involved in Burundi in the areas o f governance and
leadership.

ix.
Partnership. The government and development partners are taking steps to improve
donor harmonization. The World Bank and the African Development Bank carried out joint
stakeholder consultations in Burundi to prepare their respective country strategies. The Bank
and the International Fund for Agricultural Development are collaborating to ensure full
complementarity o f respective work programs in agriculture. Under the CAS, the Bank will
seek to improve aid effectiveness by building the capacity o f Burundi’s aid coordination unit
and by helping the government move toward sector-wide approaches and monitor progress
towards the partnership commitments o f the Paris Declaration.
x.
Risks. There are high risks to working in Burundi. Despite considerable progress
since 2000, the political and security situation remains fragile. The main risks include
deterioration in the security situation, especially in the run up to the 2010 elections; political
instability; weak governance and high fiduciary risks; limited institutional capacity; and
exogenous risks, such as weather, international prices, and security in neighboring countries.
To mitigate risks, the C A S addresses reintegration o f ex-combatants, employment generation,
agricultural development, regional integration, and more transparent and accountable public
financial management.

ASSISTANCESTRATEGY
FOR THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI

I.INTRODUCTION
1.
Burundi began emerging from a brutal civil war about nine years ago, upon the signing o f the
Arusha Peace Agreement in August 2000. Since then, the Bank has implemented three interim
strategies to support post-conflict Burundi.
2.
The first interim strategy was presented to Executive Directors in July 1999 to help
stabilize the economy immediately before and after the Arusha Peace Agreement, which established
a framework for national reconciliation and the transition to democracy.

3.
In March 2002, Bank Executive Directors discussed a second Transitional Support
Strategy, to support economic and political stabilization during Burundi’s three-year political
transition to electoral democracy.

A third Interim Strategy Note (ISN) was presented to Executive Directors in M a y 2005, a
few months before Burundi’s democratically-elected government took office. The I S N addressed
social needs while beginning to lay the foundation for sustainable economic development. In
September 2006, following an extensive consultation process, the Government o f Burundi approved
its first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).

4.

5.
This Country Assistance Strategy, based on Burundi’s PRSP, will help reinforce a
medium-term vision o f sustainable development, assisting Burundi’s transition from a postconflict economy to a developing economy. It provides a framework for World Bank Group support
to Burundi for four years, from fiscal year (FY) 2009 to FY 2012. Core principles for engagement
are: selectivity, international partnership, focus on results, governance, regional integration, and
sensitivity to political economy dynamics.
11. COUNTRYCONTEXT
A. Political and Social Context

6.
Burundi has a history of conflict since independence in 1962. It has several classic risk
factors for conflict: deep poverty, l o w economic growth, dependence on a single commodity export,
and ethnic dominance.’ The country i s small and landlocked. It has one o f the highest population
densities in Africa, close to 300 people per square kilometer, and one o f the world’s lowest per capita
incomes-US$lO9 in 2006.

7.

The most recent full war began in 1993, when the Tutsi-dominated army assassinated the
first democratically elected President, a Hutu. The ensuing violence caused over 300,000 deaths and
displaced 1.2 million people-16 percent o f the population. In 1996, a military coup took place,
leading the international community to impose an economic embargo. Hostilities continued until a
peace accord was reached in Arusha, Tanzania, in August 2000. Seventeen political organizations
signed the Arusha Agreement; but several rebel groups, including the CNDD-FDD, the largest rebel
group at the time, and the FNL-PALIPEHUTU, did not participate in the talks.

8.
From 2000 to 2005, Burundi made a successful transition to a multi-party system of
government. A Transitional Government, based on power sharing among the country’s two main

’

Where one ethnic group i s numerically dominant, so that majority rule could lead to the marginalization o f other
groups.

ethnic groups, took office in January 2002 for a 36 month term. A Tutsi president and Hutu vice
president led the Transitional Government for the first eighteen months, with a smooth handover to a
Hutu president and Tutsi vice president for the second eighteen months. By the end of 2003, the
Transitional Government had signed new peace and cease-fire agreements with all armed political
parties and movements, including the CNDD-FDD, with the exception of the FNL-PALIPEHUTU
faction. In December 2004 the government launched a demobilization program targeting the army
and combatants from former rebel groups. In February 2005, the country approved by referendum a
new constitution emphasizing power sharing and protection of minority and women's rights.
Parliamentary elections in August 2005 went relatively smoothly. The CNDD-FDD, led by Pierre
Nkurunziza, won over 58 percent of the vote. Parliament elected him the following month as the new
president.
9.
Since 2005, political progress has been mixed. The country has experienced several
political power struggles, including alleged coups, imprisonment of political figures, and grenade
attacks on the residences of political figures. In 2007, internal divisions within the ruling CNDDFDD party triggered a political crisis that paralyzed the government and parliament. The main
political parties eventually reached an agreement, and in November 2007 a broad coalition cabinet
took office that included both major ethnic groups and key political parties in full compliance with
the constitution.

10.
Security has been mixed. In September 2006, the government and the FNL-PALIPEHUTU,
the one remaining active rebel movement, signed a cease-fire agreement, but it was not implemented
and sporadic fighting continued in areas near Bujumbura. Despite strong regional support since early
2008 to revive the peace process, renewed fighting broke out between the FNL and the government
in April 2008, resulting in more than 100 deaths. In mid-May 2008, key FNL leaders returned to
Bujumbura, the first significant move to implement the 2006 cease-fire agreement. On May 26,2008,
the government and the FNL signed a joint statement ending hostilities, and resumed negotiations to
implement the cease-fire.
Corruption is widespread and entrenched after decades of conflict, hindering political
11.
and economic development. According to a recent diagnostic study on governance and corruption,
households, public officials, private enterprises, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
perceive a high level of corruption involving police, customs, tax collection, the justice system,
public procurement, and access to basic services. There have been two high-level corruption scandals
under the current government: in January 2006, a minister was dismissed for his handling of the sale
of the presidential plane, and in July 2007 another minister authorized irregular payments of US$17
million to a petroleum trading company (Interpetrol). The government has since taken action to close
public financial management loopholes, but has not started judiciary processes against the
perpetrators. Various surveys and seminars have identified impunity as a key governance weakness.
There is an opportunity to strengthen democracy, increase economic growth, reduce
12.
poverty, and exit the conflict trap, but the challenges are formidable. The risk of relapse to
conflict is high-research has shown that about half of countries will fall back into conflict within
ten years. In the short term, Burundi faces the challenge of maintaining stability before the 2010
elections. The political crises and difficult peace process underscore the fragility of the political and
security situation. Institutional capacity is weak, hindered by cronyism and corruption. To
consolidate peace and minimize the risk of future conflict, the country needs to diversify its economy
and generate pro-poor economic growth; and it also needs to build more effective, accountable, and
inclusive state institutions to improve governance, rule of law, and delivery of basic services.

B. Poverty Profile and Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals
13.
The recent war caused poverty to nearly double. The number o f poor below the poverty
threshold increased from 35 percent in 1993 to 68 percent in 2002. According to a 2006 survey, an
estimated 67 percent o f the population live below the poverty line and many live in extreme poverty.2
The Gini coefficient i s estimated at 0.38, reflecting that the main problem i s widespread poverty
rather than inequality.
14.
Poverty i s deeper and more pervasive in rural areas; and there i s substantial regional
disparity. Almost 97 percent o f Burundi’s poor live in rural areas, which have a poverty incidence o f
69 percent, compared to 34 percent in urban areas. The gap between the poverty line and the average
daily consumption per person in rural areas i s more than double the gap in urban areas. Urban
Bujumbura has the lowest poverty incidence (29 percent), while in provinces it ranges from 57
percent in Bururi to 82 percent in Kirundo, which was considered the leading supplier o f food staples
prior to the civil war.
15.
An estimated 63 percent o f the population suffers from food insecurity,with substantial
regional variation. An estimated 80 percent o f people receive only 56 percent o f the country’s total
daily consumption. The share o f population with a very l o w caloric intake i s twice as high in rural
compared to urban areas; and in the north, almost one-half the population has a very low caloric
intake, while in the south less than one-fifth has a l o w caloric intake.
16.
Poverty i s linked statistically to the education, occupation, and gender of the head of
household. The heads o f the wealthiest 20 percent o f households have proportionally more formal
education (41 percent are primary school graduates, 15 percent are secondary school graduates, and 4
percent are college graduates) than the heads o f the poorest 20 percent o f households (26 percent are
primary school graduates and 1 percent are secondary school graduates). The heads o f the poorest 20
percent o f households are more likely to be farmers. People living in female-headed households are
poorer than those in male-headed households.
17.
Maternal mortality and child malnutrition rates are the second highest on the
continent. Maternal mortality stands at 1,000 per 100,000 live births. One out o f six infants does not
survive his first birthday, and one out o f five his fifth. Malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections, and
the compounding effects o f malnutrition are the main causes o f mortality and morbidity among
children. About 44 percent o f children under five are malnourished. According to international
studies, malnutrition reduces IQ
and lowers primary school completion rates. As in other countries in
the region, the likely key determinants o f malnutrition are poor hygiene and feeding practices and
certain diseases. In 2006, the government eliminated health service fees for children under five and
for women during delivery. Since then, use o f these services had doubled, but shortages in
equipment, drugs, and qualified staff continue to constrain service delivery.
18.
HIV/AIDS i s the second most common cause of mortality among adults. The adult
prevalence rate was about 3.6% in 2007. Burundi’s rate o f 12% HIV infections among pregnant
women i s high compared with neighboring countries (Rwanda 9.8%, Uganda 8.5%, and Tanzania
7.5%).
Only 52 percent of the population i s literate. Poor households lag significantly behind
19.
more wealthy households. However, since the government introduced the “free primary school”

2

Poverty data are based o n the 2006 Questionnaire des Indicateurs de Base du Bien-Etre (QUIBB)survey.

-3-

policy in September 2005, primary education coverage has significantly improved from 80 percent in
2003-04 to about 110 percent in 2006-07. Completion rates, however, remain l o w - o n l y 40 percent
o f children that started first grade finished the primary cycle in 2006. The secondary gross enrollment
ratio o f 13 percent i s below the average for sub-Saharan Africa (25 percent).
20.
Sabotage during the war and lack of investment damaged the country’s water supply
facilities. Urban water supply coverage dropped from over 70 percent in 1993 to an estimated 60
percent at present. In rural areas, only 40 percent o f the population have access to safe drinking
water. Sanitation services in both urban and rural areas are limited; only 22 percent o f the population
have access to functional facilities and 90 percent o f these are traditional pit latrines.
Burundi i s not likely to reach many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by
21.
2015. Nearly all social indicators have sharply deteriorated as a result o f the civil war, and are now
among the worst in the world. Burundi ranks 167 out o f 177 countries in the 2007/2008 Human
Development Index o f the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Burundi’s progress
towards the MDGs i s shown in B o x 1, and further data i s provided in Annex 1.
Box 1: Burundi’s Prospects for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015
Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.
Unlikely. The poverty headcount increased from 36% in 1990 to 67% in 2006, far from the M D G target of 18
percent. In 2000 Burundi had the highest under-5 malnutrition rate in Africa at 57%. Recent data indicates that
malnutrition has decreased to 44%, although this i s s t i l l the second highest rate in Africa (the MDG target i s 23%).
Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education.
Possible. Burundi could potentially meet the target for universal primary enrollment. To this end, the government,
with development partner support, has prepared a sector plan that will be submitted to the Education for A l l Fast
Track Initiative for funding in 2008. Free universal primary education, introduced in September 2005, has increased
gross enrollment to nearly 110%. Completion rates remain low at 40% (2006/2007).
Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women,
Possible. The target on gender equality in primary education will very likely be met with the ratio of girls to boys
currently at 80 percent. The target on women’s participation in parliament has been met. Women’s lack of control
over resources, including land, remains a key challenge.
Goal 4: Reduce child mortality.
Highly unlikely. Child and infant mortality rates remain high at 190/1,000 and 114/1,000 live births, respectively,
but show improvements from 2000 peak rates o f 291/1,000 and 156/1,000 live birth.
Goal 5: Improve maternal health.
Highly unlikely. Maternal mortality remains very high at 1,000/100,000 live births. Skilled health personnel attend
only 31% o f births, well below the M D G goal o f 100%. Cost and lack o f trained health specialists are the key
constraints to accessing health services.
Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.
Possible. Burundi could potentially meet the HIV/AIDS target. Overall H I V prevalence i s 3.6% in 2007. However,
tuberculosis, which i s often linked with HIV/AIDS, has almost tripled from 125/100,000 in 1990 to 334/100,000 in
2005.
Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability.
Unlikely. Only 50% o f the population have access to improved water resources. Among these, 75% live in urban
areas and only 45% in rural areas.

C. Economic Developments and Prospects
Recent Economic Developments

22.
The recent civil war devastated the economy; and a four-year economic embargo and
several episodes of drought took a further toll. International assistance came to a near halt from a
pre-crisis level o f about US$300 million per annum. Per capita income f e l l by almost 40 percent
during the war, from US$180 in 1993 to US$1 10 in 2003. To reach by 2012 the GDP per capita it
had in 1993, Burundi’s GDP per capita would need to grow by about 8 percent a year.
23.
Since 2000, economic performance has improved, but real GDP growth still averaged
only 2.7 percent from 2001-2006. Real GDP growth reached 4.8 percent in 2004, falling to 0.9
percent in 2005 due to a severe drought, and then bounced back to 5.1 percent in 2006. The economic
growth rate in 2007 i s estimated at 3.6 percent, reflecting a poor agricultural harvest, and growth i s
projected to reach 4.5 percent in 2008. (See Table 1: K e y Macroeconomic Indicators; Annex 1:
Burundi at a Glance; and Annex 2: Key Economic Indicators.)

The private sector i s small and faces one of the most unfavorable business environments
in Africa. The formal private sector consists o f about 3,000 registered enterprises, mainly small and
medium enterprises employing some 37,000 workers (2004). Firms surveyed in 2006 as part o f a
recent Investment Climate Assessment reported l o w performance due to poor infrastructure,
especially electricity; lack o f access to financing; political and economic instability; and high
taxation.
26.
Developing financial intermediation i s important for private sector development. There
are seven banks, four o f which are state-owned, and two state-owned non-bank financial institutions.
Most o f the banks have internal weaknesses and a high number o f non-performing loans. The Central
Bank i s taking measures to strengthen the banking sector, including increasing the bank capital
requirement (nearly all banks are n o w in compliance).
27.
Burundi has a fledging mining industry. The country may have considerable mining
deposits, including platinum, uranium, tin, cobalt, copper, iron-titan-vanadium, and an estimated 6
percent o f the world’s nickel deposits. As a first step to developing the sector, the government i s
establishing a legal and institutional framework to ensure wide distribution o f mining sector benefits.

-5-

28.
The economy i s dominated by public enterprises. A 2007 study found that the government
had shares in 48 e n t i t i e s 4 0 enterprises and 8 financial i n s t i t u t i o n s - o f which 16 were fully
publicly owned. A handful o f public enterprises dominate the exports o f the country: coffee, tea,
beer, sugar and cigarettes. The 12 most important public and semi-public enterprises employed more
than half o f the c i v i l service (23,259 persons) and contributed 7.4 percent o f the state’s fiscal
revenues; but were heavily indebted (US$138 million, or 18 percent o f GDP in 2005). There i s
limited data o n budget transfers t o public enterprises and such transfers are not explicit in the budget.
The high level o f public enterprise indebtedness, part o f which has been settled through treasury
bonds, presents a potential risk to the government in case o f bankruptcy.
29.
Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, has averaged 7.2 percent from 2001
to 2006, with large fluctuations. Average inflation topped 13.4 percent in 2005, dropped to 2.8
percent in 2006 due to tighter monetary policy, and rose to 8.3 percent in 2007, attributed to
increases in food and petrol prices. GDP deflator inflation also shows a similar pattern (Table 1). In
the first four months o f 2008, domestic prices o f fuel and basic staples rose o n average by 23 percent,
pushing the overall inflation rate over the same period to 11.7 percent.
30.
The government’s successful implementation of an economic reform program enabled
Burundi to reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) decision point in August 2005.
Debt relief to Burundi under the enhanced HIPC Initiative will total about US$826 million in net
present value (NPV) terms, equivalent to 9 1.5 percent o f the NPV o f Burundi’s debt after traditional
debt relief.

The government has advanced regional integration, recognizing i t s importance for export
diversification and economic growth. In 2005, Burundi became a member o f the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), a regional economic community supporting the
development o f a free trade area and common market for Eastern and Southern African states. In
June 2007, the National Assembly ratified the Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the
Great Lakes Region, making Burundi the first signatory to ratify. Burundi joined the East Africa
Community (EAC) o n July 1, 2007, and will have to rapidly incorporate into the E A C Customs
Union established in 2004. T o do so, Burundi will need to eliminate remaining non-tariff barriers to
trade, support development o f transport infrastructure, and adapt to existing E A C policies and
processes. As an E A C member, Burundi i s now moving toward an Economic Partnership Agreement
(EPA) with the European Union, with the signing in November 2007 o f a framework for negotiating
a full EPA. Burundi i s in the process o f establishing a ministerial committee chaired by the Second
Vice President to help develop and implement an E A C strategy.

Public Finance Structure
32.
Government expenditure increased from 27.2 percent of GDP in 2001 to 38.2 percent in
2006. This i s considerably higher than many sub-Saharan African countries. Recurrent expenditure
accounts for 60 percent o f total expenditure and has risen only slightly over the last six years. The
wage bill has increased to nearly 10 percent o f GDP in 2006, reflecting the hiring o f new teachers in
2005 and a 15 percent salary increase in 2006, the first since 2001. Capital expenditure has doubled
from 6.4 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 14.8 percent in 2006 due to foreign grants.
33.
Government revenue (excluding grants) as a share of GDP has been stable at around 20
percent in 2001-06. Grants n o w represent nearly half o f total government revenue, bringing total
government revenue to 27.7 percent o f GDP in 2006.
34.
Fiscal performance was satisfactory in 2005-06, but mixed in 2007, due to slower than
expected demobilization and unbudgeted payments totaling 1.6 percent o f GDP to the largest
domestic petroleum distribution firm, Interpetrol. The government took mitigating measures, but the
2007 budget deficit (excluding grants) i s estimated at 20.1 percent o f GDP (compared to 19.3 percent
in 2006). The overall deficit on a commitment basis averaged about 4.3 percent o f GDP in 20012006. The share o f the deficit funded by external partners increased from 27 percent in 2001 to 90
percent in 2006. Shortfalls in budget support in 2006, reflecting in part donors’ governance
concerns, were offset by spending cuts in non wage spending and increased domestic borrowing.
35.
The government has increased public expenditure allocations to priority sectors over
the past six years (see Table 2). As a result o f the availability o f HIPC funds starting in 2005 and
increased donor support, the government has increased priority economic and social expenditures
from 5.2 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 9.3 percent in 2006 and to an expected 12 percent in 2007,
mainly reflecting an increase in education expenditures. Demobilization has reduced defense
expenditures, but the increase in the police force has more than offset the savings. A reduction in
security sector expenditures i s needed to provide fiscal space for further increases in social sector
expenditures.

The government has taken steps since 2005 to improve public financial management
(PFM). The government introduced a double-entry accounting system, a new nomenclature that
helps to identify pro-poor expenditures, and an interim computerized financial management
information system. Following the Interpetrol incident, the government introduced further changes in
the 2008 annual budget law; and in M a y 2008 it presented a new organic law to parliament, which
has not yet taken action. The government i s also consolidating i t s cash management by closing offbudgetary accounts. A new procurement law was promulgated in February 2008 after considerable
delay. Despite progress, there remain major weaknesses affecting P F M quality and transparency.
37.
The government and the Bank recently completed a Public Expenditure Management
and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) to prioritize future reforms. It identifies four
main challenges: (i)improving the allocative efficiency o f public expenditures by reducing security
sector expenditures and increasing public expenditures to education, health, and infrastructure, in line
with the PRSP; (ii)
maintaining control o f the wage bill, including by eliminating ghost workers; (iii)
continuing to reform PFM procedures and practices to increase transparency and strengthen fiscal
discipline, including by consolidating the budget, streamlining budget execution, reducing the use of
exceptional procedures, and improving internal and external audit systems; and (iv) professionalizing
the public service to improve performance, including by creating staff appraisal and grading systems
and reducing the number o f political appointees.
External Trade

38.
Large current account deficits reflect the country's limited exports, consisting mainly of
coffee and tea, and its dependence on imports of fuel and capital goods. During 2001-06, the
share o f exports in GDP averaged 6.3 percent, with a l o w 4.9 percent in 2002 and a high 7.2 percent
in 2004, reflecting swings in the coffee trade. The share o f imports in GDP steadily increased from
16.4 percent in 2001 to 26.6 percent in 2006 and 30.3 percent in 2007. The current account deficit
(including grants) rose from 8.1 percent o f GDP in 2004, to an estimated 16 percent in 2007,
reflecting a sharp rise in the services trade deficit.
39.
Burundi i s one of the hardest hit countries in Africa by recent food and fuel price
increases (see Box 2). It i s a net importer o f food and o i l products, and i t s position as a landlocked
country raises import costs. The food price increase in Burundi mainly reflects higher petroleum and
transport costs. Together, food and h e 1 imports represent an estimated 43 percent o f total imports.
-8-

Maize, sugar, and wheat are the largest food imports and crude o i l i s the primary fuel import, and
together they account for about one quarter o f imports.
Medium-Term Prospects

40.
The medium-term economic framework assumes an acceleration of real GDP growth
from 3.6 in 2007 to 4.5 percent in 2008 and to 5 percent until 2011. Growth i s likely to fluctuate
given the economy’s susceptibility to weather conditions. The main driving force behind the real
GDP growth rate remains the primary sector (of which food crops constitute about 80 percent),
which contributes about 49 percent to GDP. There i s a slow shift to secondary and tertiary sectors.
41.
Annual average inflation (measured by the GDP deflator) i s projected to decline from a
high o f 18.5 percent in 2008 to 6.6 percent in 201 l.3
This assumes improved Central Bank liquidity
management, limited financing o f government activities by the Central Bank, and a modest mediumterm decline in food and energy prices, although not to their initial levels.
42.
The fiscal deficit i s expected to average 2.0 percent of GDP, including grants. Wages and
salaries are projected to peak in 2008 at 1 1.O percent o f GDP, mainly due to delays in demobilization
and the need to hire teachers. Assuming continued demobilization and wage restraint, they will then
progressively decline by 201 1 to the previous level o f around 10 percent o f GDP. Total revenue as a
percentage o f GDP i s expected to remain at about 19.0 percent. The fiscal deficit excluding grants,
declines from 24 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 19.8 percent in 201 1, while the deficit including grants
increases slightly, reflecting a shift from external to domestic financing.
Box 2: Food and Fuel Price Increases: Impact and Policy Options
Burundi i s vulnerable to food and fuel price shocks because it i s landlocked and a net importer o f food. Agricultural
land i s overexploited and degraded, resulting in declining food production. According to a recent IMF study,
Burundi i s one o f fourteen hardest-hit countries in sub-Saharan Africa by the recent increases in international prices.
Impact: From December 2007 to April 2008, prices o f basic staples rose on average by 23 percent, exacerbating
malnutrition and poverty, including in coffee growing provinces in the north that have the highest poverty rate.
There i s also a significant macroeconomic impact: preliminary estimates suggest that additional financing of US$15
million (about 1.5 percent o f GDP) i s needed to offset budgetary costs related to food and fuel price increases.

Policy Responses: The government has reduced the tariff on imported diesel, which i s mainly consumed by the
poor, and has increased the tariff on gasoline imports to preserve overall tax collection levels. In addition,
development partners are working with the government to urgently address food insecurity and to increase the
domestic agricultural supply response. Interventions include:

increasing food aid and better targeting food-aid programs to vulnerable groups,
scaling up programs that provide farm inputs to producers, such as seeds and fertilizer for the upcoming
agricultural season; and
enhancing longer-term food supply through reforms and investments, such as small-scale irrigation, to increase
agricultural production and productivity.
The government has requested an increase in IDA budget support. The Bank and the government are discussing
possible additional financing under the new Global Food Crisis Response Program Trust Fund. The IMF increased
the amount of the recent PRGF, as requested by the government, in view o f the external shock. Other donors are
considering similar assistance.

shown in Table 1, both measurements o f inflation (consumer price and GDP deflator) show a similar pattern.

Box 3: Coffee-Past

Source o f Conflict, Potential Source o f Future Growth

The coffee sector i s central to Burundi’s poverty reduction and conflict-prevention agenda. Coffee provides income
to about 800,000 households, nearly half the rural population, and it accounts for about 70 percent of export
revenues. During the war, production fell sharply, from over 45,000 tons in 1994 to 18,000 tons in 2001. Production
i s volatile due to the old age o f coffee trees, which cannot carry two consecutive years o f high production.
Production i s also declining due to an institutional structure that provides disincentives to farmers, who receive the
lowest prices in the sub-region.
A Factor in Past Conflicts. The Belgian colonial authorities introduced coffee cultivation to provide cash income to
the rural population and generate foreign exchange earnings. Planting coffee trees was made compulsory in areas
suitable for coffee production. Post independence governments continued the policy o f forced coffee cultivation, and
established a monopoly for the processing and export o f coffee, paying producers a small fraction o f the
international price. The country’s small urban elite benefited from this price difference. In the 198Os, the
government promoted a massive coffee tree planting program, with the objective o f increasing production from
30,000 tons to 50,000 tons by the early 1990s. It also invested in about 140 washing stations with World Bank
support. The area under coffee more than doubled, but for lack o f adequate incentives, the yields declined
dramatically.

Good Potential for Growth. Burundi produces highly prized “mild Arabicas” and has the potential to enter high
value specialty markets. In the central highlands, climatic and agronomic conditions are ideal for high quality coffee
cultivation. In neighboring Rwanda, close to 1,000 tons o f fully washed coffee was sold in 2006 at a price close to
US$2/lb, compared to an average price for Burundian coffee o f about US$.86/lb.
Status of Reforms. The Government o f Burundi has repeatedly signaled i t s commitment to coffee sector reform to
improve production, yields, and farmer incomes. In 2005 and 2006, the government took steps to liberalize the

sector and created a Coffee Reform Steering Committee. However, strong vested interests have slowed sector
reforms. The reform agenda experienced a setback in 2007 when the government arranged to market all fully
washed coffee through a monopoly broker based in New York. In 2008, the Government took corrective actions and
prepared new regulations to clearly define the rules for all players in the coffee sector. The government i s
commissioning, with World Bank support, a study to evaluate options for sector restructuring. The study will use a
participatory process and engage all stakeholders; and i s expected to lead to the adoption o f a reform plan by the end
of the year.

43,
The current account deficit, excluding official transfers, narrows from 2008 onwards,
but remains substantial, decreasing from 36.3 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 31.9 percent in 2008 and
further to 30.3 percent in 2011. Exports, especially coffee and minerals, should increase and
reconstruction-related imports should slow.
44.
These projections depend on sustained macroeconomic, public finance, and sector
policy reforms. Primary sector growth depends on reforms and investments to increase food crop
productivity. Secondary sector growth depends on increased mining; petroleum sector reforms; and
higher value-added from agro-processing, including a more efficient coffee sector leading to higher
coffee output and quality (see B o x 3). Service sector growth will accompany primary and secondary
sector growth, and will also depend on increased dynamism o f the financial sector and on investment
in telecommunications following the expected privatization o f the state telecommunications
company. Small and medium enterprises are expected to play an important role in future growth.
Strong public expenditure in priority economic and social sectors will further stimulate growth.
Medium-term growth prospects also depend on increased political stability; improved security;
successful integration into the EAC; and continued technical and financial support from the donor
community.

Debt Sustainability

45.
Since reaching the HIPC decision point in 2005, Burundi has benefited from Interim
HIPC debt relief. The country has made good progress toward most o f the nine completion point
triggers (see Annex 4). Barring unforeseen governance or reform setbacks, Burundi could reach the
completion point by early 2009. After reaching the completion point, Burundi will be eligible for a
relatively small amount o f additional debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
46.
Even after full debt relief, Burundi will remain at high risk o f debt distress, mainly due
to the country’s low export base. A Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis (FY08) reveals that
even after delivery o f full enhanced HIPC and MDRI assistance, the net present value o f debt-toexports ratio remains above 100 percent, placing Burundi in the “high risk o f debt distress” category.
Less concessional borrowing or lower GDP or export growth would substantially increase the risk of
implementing reforms to
debt distress. This analysis suggests that the government concentrate on: (i)
increase and diversify exports and to promote growth; (ii)maintaining prudent fiscal and monetary
policies; (iii)ensuring prudent debt management, including obtaining external grant financing as
much as possible and avoiding non-concessional debts; and (iv) strengthening debt management
policies and institutions.

111. GOVERNMENTPROGRAM
A. Burundi’s Poverty Reduction Strategy

47.
The Government of Burundi approved its first PRSP in September 2006.4 This was an
impressive achievement during the post-conflict period. The PRSP aims to lay the foundation for
national reconciliation and economic recovery and end the cycle o f violence. PRSP preparation
lasted two years and included an extensive participatory process, unprecedented in Burundi’s history.
Consultations took place in all seventeen provinces (146 communes), involving 840 people from
more than 145 civil society organizations, and fourteen sector and thematic groups. Burundi’s
Council o f Ministers adopted the PRSP and Parliament approved the PRSP prior to its review by the
Boards o f the IMF and World Bank. The PRSP built upon an Interim PRSP completed in November
2003.
48.
Four strategic priorities emerged from the consultation process: (i)improve governance
and security; (ii)promote sustainable and equitable economic growth; (iii)develop human capital;
and (iv) prevent and control HIV/AIDS. In addition to these four axes, the PRSP highlights the need
to: refocus the role o f government to give room to the private sector and community-based
organizations; build institutional capacity at both central and local levels; address gender inequalities;
and build a new partnership with donors. With World Bank support, the government i s elaborating a
PRSP results and policy matrix to better monitor PRSP implementation.
Axis 1: Improve Security and Governance

49.
The PRSP recognizes security as a precondition for economic growth and poverty
reduction. I t s security objective i s to restore free movement o f persons and goods throughout the
country. To do so, the government intends to implement a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire
with the remaining rebel group; continue to demobilize, reintegrate ex-combatants, and maintain the
size o f the military and police forces at levels that are sufficient for security and that are fiscally
sustainable; implement security sector reform to professionalize the security forces; and prevent the
proliferation o f small arms. T o sustain peace, the PRSP also highlights the need to strengthen the rule
o f law and the judicial system, and to establish mechanisms for settling and preventing land disputes
(see B o x 4).
50.
The PRSP underscores the importance of good governance following decades of
malfeasance that contributed to conflict. The government aims to strengthen the culture o f
democracy, including by promoting decentralization and greater citizen participation. I t will
strengthen public administration through a civil service reform policy. It will also strengthen
transparency and accountability o f public resource management. In August 2006, Burundi
established a Special Anti-Corruption Brigade and ratified an anti-corruption law.
A x i s 2: Achieving Equitable and Sustainable Growth
51.
The PRSP’s growth strategy focuses on the rural sector. Given the importance o f
agriculture in the economy, sustained growth in the rural sector would reduce income disparities and
poverty. Thus, the PRSP emphasizes the need to improve agricultural productivity, although it i s not
specific about the specific measures to raise efficiency and output.

(Report No. 38478-BI).

Box 4: The Land Problem
Burundi’s population has increased fourfold over the past fifty years. Together with Rwanda and Comoros, Burundi
has the highest population density in Africa: over 300 inhabitants per square kilometer. Demographic pressures have
caused land scarcity and fragmentation and environmental degradation, creating a cycle o f poverty and contributing
to Burundi’s cycle o f violence. According to the Ministry o f Public Security, 60 percent o f crimes are linked to land
issues.
Returning refugees, most o f whose land i s now occupied, further exacerbate the land problem. About 300,000
refugees have returned since 2003; and another 45,000 are expected to return in the near future.
To address the land problem, Burundi needs to (i)
resolve the immediate problem o f restoring land to returnees or
offering alternative compensation; and (ii)seek a lasting solution through a land reform policy that addresses
security o f tenure, which i s critical for sustainable agriculture.
As a f r s t step towards land reform, the government needs to promote dialogue between all parties to define a policy
on land issues. A census o f agricultural lands, which i s underway with Bank support, will help establish the basis for
redistribution and titling mechanisms. The government needs to revise the 1987 Land Code and harmonize it with
traditional practices.

52.
The PRSP calls for making the private sector the engine o f growth, through economic
liberalization and government divestiture from the productive sector. Reform o f the legal and
regulatory framework i s a precondition for attracting direct foreign investment.
53.
I t recognizes weak infrastructure-mainly transport and energy-as constraints to
growth, and emphasizes the need for regional integration. Improving transport infrastructure i s
important to facilitate access t o markets and unlock Burundi’s economic potential. The challenge i s
to define an action plan that identifies priority road projects based o n economic return and poverty
reduction impact. The PRSP also proposes to integrate Burundi into a regional railway network and
expand and make the Bujumbura port a transit center. T o address Burundi’s severe shortfall in
electricity, the PRSP calls for the rehabilitation o f existing power plants, construction o f new plants,
and the development o f a rural electrification program that includes expansion o f the grid and
dissemination o f information o n alternative energy sources.

Axis 3 and 4: Developing Human Capital and Fighting HIV/AIDS

54.
To develop human capital, the PRSP calls for expanding quality social services in local
communities. The PRSP aims to expand access to education and improve i t s quality. In health, the
PRSP aims to reduce child and maternal mortality rates through improved access to basic health
services, recognizing that cost i s the key barrier to access. The challenge i s to find efficient and
sustainable methods t o subsidize life-saving services while also training and redeploying staff. The
government demonstrated i t s commitment to increase expenditures o n social services by introducing
a “free primary school” policy in September 2005, and by eliminating certain health care fees in
2006.

55.
The PRSP highlights the government’s determination to stem the spread o f HIVIAIDS
and reduce its impact on individuals, families, and communities. Under the PRSP, the
government will take actions to prevent HIV transmission and increase treatment to people living
with HIV, with an emphasis o n continued decentralization and creation o f new treatment sites and
targeting high risks groups.

B. Development Partner Support

56.
Burundi depends on aid and will continue to need high levels of donor assistance.
Official Development Assistance accounted for 54.6 percent o f gross national income in 2004.
During 2006 and 2007, budget support from donors accounted for 30 percent and 20 percent
respectively o f the total government budget.
57.
Donors have shifted their aid from humanitarian to development assistance. In 2008,
recognizing that Burundi no longer faced an acute humanitarian crisis, the UN discontinued the
Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP), which has provided a framework for humanitarian aid since
2000. The UN Office for the Coordination o f Humanitarian Affairs in Burundi, which prepares the
CAP i s considering to close i t s Burundi office. Donors, such have Switzerland, have shifted their
assistance to bilateral development programs.
58.

The number o f donors has increased as the peace process has progressed. Until recently,
few donors were active in Burundi, mainly Belgium, the European Union (EU), Germany, the
Netherlands, United Kingdom (UK), United States (US), and the World Bank. The EU and the Bank
accounted for almost half the total development outlays. During the first donor Round Table meeting
held in Bujumbura in M a y 2007, participation included sixty representatives from the international
community that pledged US$656 million, including US$175 million in budget support, to support the
PRSP financing gap.

59.
Burundi i s one of the first beneficiaries of the UN Peace Building Commission (PBC).
The PBC was established in 2005 to help prevent a relapse to conflict by coordinating and
monitoring peace-building efforts. The Peace Building Fund has allocated US$35 million to Burundi
to finance peace building activities, including strengthening capacities for coexistence and conflict
resolution and implementing activities that address threats to the peace process.

Iv. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERIM STRATEGY AND LESSONS
LEARNED
60.
The World Bank formulated the I S N as Burundi completed its successful transition to a
multi-party government. Executive Directors discussed the I S N in M a y 2005. Parliamentary
elections took place a few months later, in August 2005, and a new government took office in
September 2005.
61.
I n this context, the I S N addressed immediate social needs while laying the foundation
for sustainable economic growth. It focused o n two main objectives: (i)expanding access to basic
social services and income-generating activities; and (ii)developing the foundation for sustainable
growth and poverty alleviation. The I S N also aimed to help Burundi reach the HIPC decision point
and move towards the completion point, and prepare a participatory and inclusive PRSP. The I S N
was aligned with Burundi’s Interim PRSP and reflected consultations with stakeholders. To
accomplish these objectives, the I S N envisioned financial assistance o f about US$ I 7 0 million (grants
under IDA 14), analytical and advisory activities (AAA), and increasing I F C reengagement.
Overall implementation of the I S N i s satisfactory: Burundi has progressed towards the
62.
I S N objectives (see Annex 5). Notably, Burundi reached the HIPC decision point in August 2005;
and in September 2006, the government approved a participatory PRSP, which was a key I S N
outcome.
I D A and Analytical and Advisory Activities

63.
The Bank has delivered all operations envisioned in the ISN. From June 2005 to
December 2007, the Bank approved five IDA grants amounting to about US$170 million, including
an unforeseen regional communications infrastructure project. The Bank’s financing included US$60
million in budget support. From January to June 2008, the Bank approved three additional grants
amounting to US$SO million. Total IDA financing from June 2005 to June 2008 amounted to
US$250 million.
64.
The Bank’s analytical and advisory activities informed the PRSP and underpinned
investment operations and sector strategies. AAA included: a study on rural sources o f growth; a
debt sustainability analysis (with the IMF); a country status report on education; a health financing
study; a qualitative study o n youth; a public expenditure management and financial accountability
review (the first since 1992); an investment climate assessment (the first in Burundi); and an analysis
o f non-tariff trade barriers in preparation for implementation o f the E A C Customs Union. In addition,
the World Bank Institute (WBI), with the support o f trust funds, has provided technical assistance to
strengthen leadership and governance.
65.
Burundi has benefitted from generous trust fund financing. In addition to the MultiDonor Reintegration Program Trust Fund, which provided substantial funding for the Demobilization
and Reintegration Program, Burundi has benefitted from the L o w Income Countries under Stress
(LICUS) trust fund and various Belgian trust funds that supported governance diagnosis, leadership
training, and poverty monitoring. Japan PHRD grants have helped the government prepare projects.
A small grant from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) trust fund i s helping
to prepare a health project. There i s an ongoing Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant to
improve the institutional environment for mining.
66.
Project portfolio performance has been satisfactory but needs close monitoring. There
are currently ten active IDA-financed projects, including three regional projects, and there i s one
GEF-financed project. In addition, two recently approved projects are not yet effective. The average

- 15-

age o f projects i s 3 years, with two projects that are one-year old and two projects due to close by the
end o f 2008. All projects are currently rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory, with the
exception o f the Demobilization, Reinsertion, and Reintegration Project and the Road Sector
Development Project, which are each rated moderately unsatisfactory. Annex 6 provides selected
indicators o f the Bank portfolio; and Annex 7 provides a summary o f the Operations Portfolio.
67.
The Bank and the government carried out a Country Portfolio Performance Review
(CPPR) in May 2008 to identify portfolio issues and recommend appropriate actions to improve
portfolio performance. A joint Bank-government action plan to implement key CPPR
recommendations i s presented in Annex 8.
The International Finance Corporation

68.
I F C support to Burundi has gradually increased over the past few years, mainly
involving technical assistance to develop SMEs and improve the investment climate. IFC i s
building the capacity o f the Association o f Burundi Women Entrepreneurs, including assisting 105
members to prepare business plans. It i s now developing a capacity building program for the
Chamber o f Commerce. I F C has also supported the financial sector: it invited two Burundi banks,
Banque de Credit de Bujumbura (BCB) and Interbank, to participate in the IFC Global Trade Finance
Program. I F C and B C B signed a US$2.0 million Trade Finance Guarantee Insurance Agreement
(TFGIA) in November 2007, and IFC and Interbank signed a US$2.0 million TFGIA in June 2008.
IFC i s also exploring the possibility o f involving the Burundian banks in the Africa MSME Finance
Program. At the government’s request, IFC’s investment climate team has provided assistance to
help Burundi improve its Doing Business indicators and to undertake private sector reforms
supported by the two-tranche IDA-financed Economic Reform Support Grant (2006). In 2007, I F C
provided advice on the privatization o f the state-owned telecommunications company, although the
government has not yet taken action. There are no I F C investments in Burundi at this time (see
Annex.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency

69.
MIGA has issued one guarantee in Burundi in the telecommunications sector. MIGA
coverage o f US$1 million was provided to Mauritius Telecom Ltd. for a project to develop, operate,
and maintain a nationwide mobile telephone network using the GSM 900 standard. Burundi has a
teledensity o f less than 1 percent, among the lowest in the world.
Lessons Learned

70.
Development policy operations have helped initiate key reforms and jumpstart the
economy; but they must be sensitive to the fragile political environment and weak institutional
capacity. A post-conflict government with weak capacity and operating in a fragile environment
cannot be expected to carry out a broad and complex economic reform program. Economic reforms
supported by development policy operations should be focused and realistic; and the speed o f
reforms needs to take into consideration the conflicting interests o f stakeholders. Operations should
also be sensitive to the need for internal consensus.
71.
Public works have been effective in creating employment and consolidating peace; but
they require close supervision. The Public Works and Employment Creation Project (US$40
million IDA credit in 2001 and additional grant o f US$30.6 million in 2006), was one o f the most
successful Bank-financed operations in Burundi in recent years, financing highly labor-intensive
works that employed thousands o f poor, built social capital in communities, and promoted Burundian

- 16-

construction companies and suppliers. However, it was important to supervise contracts closely and
immediately address any governance issues to ensure the project’s credibility. Employment
generating operations will continue to be important, especially for demobilized combatants and for
youth (age 15-30) who represent 30 percent o f the population.
72.

I t i s important to remain flexible and responsive to changing circumstances. In late

2005, the President o f Burundi initiated a policy o f free basic education, leading to a surge in demand
for school infrastructure and materials. The Bank adjusted i t s investment program and accelerated the
preparation o f an education project that became effective in FY07. This decision helped pave the way
for a multi-donor approach in the education sector, including the formulation o f a basket fund
mechanism.

A February 2008 client survey suggests that the Bank should work more closely with
73.
civil society and be more forceful in promoting transparency and good governance. K e y survey
results, and comparisons t o 2005 survey results, are summarized in B o x 5.
74.
Independent Evaluations Group (IEG) project ratings have differed only slightly from
Implementation Completion Report ratings, and have resulted in several important
recommendations. The IEG has evaluated three projects implemented during the I S N period-the
Second Health and Population Project; the Second Social Action Project, and the Economic
Reconstruction Credit-and gave each an outcome rating o f moderately satisfactory. These projects
were executed in a difficult environment marked by a political transition; and a l l three projects
encountered implementation difficulties. IEG recommendations include: (i)ensure coherent results
frameworks and restructure as needed during project implementation, especially in an uncertain
environment; (ii)simplify project design in a conflict situation, in order to deliver urgently needed
support quickly; and (iii)focus conditionality o n results rather than o n the preparation o f action
plans, strategies, and draft legislation. IEG lowered the outcome rating o f the Economic
Reconstruction Credit t o “moderately satisfactory” because institutional reforms were limited.

Box 5: Client Survey
In February 2008, the World Bank contracted a client survey. I t followed up a first client survey carried out in 2005
during the preparation o f the Interim Strategy Note.
Methodology. Interviewers contacted 1,200 individuals in five (of 17) provinces selected to represent the country:
the city o f Bujumbura, Bujumbura rural, Bururi, Gitega, and Ngozi. 1,196 people respondedto the interview.
Survey results:

68% think Bank-fbndedactivities help families; and 77% think they help the nation. Results in 2005 were 43%
and 57%, respectively.
0

54% o f respondents think Bank-supported activities should embolden good governance and transparency, up
from 45% in 2005.
Respondents identified three areas as most important for Bank support: (i)
agriculture and rural development;
(ii)
poverty reduction activities, such as employment; and (iii)
health.
70% o f respondents believe the Bank should work more closely with direct beneficiaries and civil society.
Results were about the same in 2005.
53% o f respondents attached high importance to demobilization, disarmament, and reintegration, up from 43%
in 2005.
5 1% o f respondents are optimistic about Burundi’s future, down from 56% in 2005

V. THEWORLDBANKGROUP
ASSISTANCESTRATEGY
75.
The C A S aims to support Burundi’s transition from a post-conflict economy to a
developing economy by selectively assisting the government to implement the PRSP. The CAS
provides a framework for World Bank support to Burundi over four years, from FY 2009 to 2012.
76.

T o do so, the C A S will focus on two strategic objectives and one cross-cutting objective.
Strategic objective one i s to promote sustainable and broad-based economic growth.
It supports the second axis o f the PRSP. It focuses on three outcomes: (i)increased

productivity o f food crops and high-value exports; (ii)improved business environment;
and (iii)improved infrastructural services with enhanced regional integration.
Strategic objective two is to improve access to social services and consolidate social
stability. It supports the first, third, and fourth axes o f the PRSP. It focuses on three
outcomes: (i)improved reintegration o f ex-combatants and vulnerable groups; (ii)more
efficient and transparent public financial management; and (ii)improved access to and
quality o f basic social services and decreased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.
Governance i s a cross-cutting objective. The CAS will strengthen and expand Bank
support to improve governance. It will help the government implement the matrix o f
governance actions under the f i r s t axis o f the PRSP and to update the matrix based on the
PEMFAR and recent diagnostic study on governance and corruption. It will: (i)minimize
fiduciary and governance risks in Bank-funded operations; (ii)improve governance in
sectors where the Bank i s involved; (iii)strengthen Burundi’s core governance
institutions and public financial management; and (iv) increase the demand for good
governance. Strengthening governance in Burundi i s a long-term endeavor that will
extend beyond the CAS period.

A. The Framework for World Bank Engagement in Burundi
77.
Align with national priorities. The CAS supports the implementation o f Burundi’s PRSP.
The World Bank and the African Development Bank discussed respective CAS priorities during joint
CAS consultations in March 2008 with the government, parliament, development partners, private
sector, and civil society (see B o x 6). The CAS will also build on the core principles o f the Africa
Action Plan.
78.
Strengthen World Bank Group coordination. Recognizing the importance o f maximizing
World Bank Group impact o n private sector growth and capacity building, this C A S presents the first
fully articulated World Bank-IFC strategy for Burundi. The WBI will continue to be involved in the
areas o f governance and leadership.
79.
Improve donor harmonization and aid effectiveness and reduce transaction costs for the
government. Conditions in Burundi are right for major improvements in donor harmonization; and
the government and development partners are taking action (see para. 121-125). Under the CAS, the
Bank will support improved aid effectiveness by building the capacity o f Burundi’s aid coordination
unit and helping the government move toward sector-wide approaches and monitor progress towards
the partnership commitments o f the Paris Declaration.

80.
Maintain selectivity and focus on results. The CAS i s selective in i t s focus: it supports two
strategic objectives and six outcomes. It i s also selective by complementing the financing o f other
- 18-

donors (see Annex 10 for an overview of donor assistance to Burundi). For example, the Bank will
support urban water supply investments, while other partners support rural water supply investments.
The Bank will encourage sector-wide approaches to maximize complementarity.

81.
Enhance regional integration. As a small, landlocked country with limited natural
resources, Burundi's development is linked to that of its neighbors, and the government is thus keen
to enhance regional integration. Its membership to the EAC since July 2007 provides a framework
for promoting efficient transport services, increased agricultural exports, increased energy supply,
and a stronger private sector. Burundi will also need to collaborate with its neighbors to address
water resource management and migratory diseases such as HIVIAIDS and tuberculosis. Given
Burundi's need to incorporate quickly into the EAC Customs Union, the Bank will help the EAC
reduce barriers to trade, including non-tariff barriers, and to undertake informational activities,
targeting customs officials in Burundi to inform them on EAC protocol.
Box 6: CAS Consultations
The World Bank and the African Development Bank carried out joint consultations with stakeholders in Bujumbura
in March 2008. Stakeholders emphasized the following challenges: security; reintegration of demobilized soldiers;
governance/corruption; quality of leadership; and unemployment.
'The private sector emphasized the difficult business environment, and discussed the need to strengthen the
agricultural sector and diversify exports; develop the mining sector; reform and strengthen the financial sector;
support micro, small, and medium enterprises; improve governance through more transparent procurement; and
institutionalize dialogue between the government and private sector, which is currently nearly nonexistent.
Civil society representatives noted the need to address corruption and improve governance and human rights;
ensure that international assistance (including budget support) benefits provinces equitably; and educate the public
about procurement procedures. Participants also recommended that donors involve civil society in the design of
development projects, and urged the Bank to meet frequently with civil society to share information on project
preparation and implementation.
Governance-related institutions (State Inspector General, Court of Accounts, Anti-Corruption Court, and Anticorruption Brigade) emphasized the need for capacity building and better public information.
The four former presidents and the three main political parties emphasized security, good governance, and a
well functioning judiciary as prerequisites for private investment needed for economic growth and poverty
reduction. They recommended more funding for basic infrastructure, especially roads to facilitate domestic and
external trade. They urged special attention to reinsertion and reintegration of demobilized soldiers.
Government officials and members of parliament emphasized: the need to fight corruption and impunity;
modernize the civil service and build its capacity; strengthen agriculture; increase employment; support
vulnerable groups, and help Burundi integrate to the EAC. Cabinet members provided overviews of their
portfolios. Members of parliament discussed the need to address high population growth, promote women's rights
including access to land, and improve social services.
International partners discussed the increased risks in delivering external assistance in the run up to the 2010
presidential elections; and they noted the need for international assistance to build electoral capacity and help civil
society monitor the electoral process. Donors noted the importance of: continued budget support, assisting
regional integration, and strengthening agriculture, including the need to diversify and access niche markets and to
cany out the agricultural census. Donors emphasized the need for closer donor coordination, including more joint
missions, joint analytical work, and more sector-wide approaches.

As further input to CAS preparation, the World Bank engaged a local political scientist and an international political
scientist to identify political economy issues relevant to CAS outcomes. Their political economy analysis informs
the CAS, particularly the description of development challenges, the design of the Bank's work program, and the
identification and mitigation of risks.
The Bank also organized a security and governance workshop in Bujumbura to seek input from civil society,
academia, and government representatives on sources of conflict and links between conflict and governance.

82.
Address capacity at all levels. The Bank will work with development partners to ensure
coordinated and comprehensive support for Burundi’s capacity development. A Bank mission in
FY09 will carry out a capacity building needs assessment.
83.
Mainstream gender within all six CAS outcomes. The Bank will address gender issues
throughout i t s work program to increase growth and reduce poverty. This includes: agricultural
development that provides opportunities to women; encouraging women’s entrepreneurship;
improving infrastructure (such as water supply) to reduce the burden o n women; gender-sensitive
reintegration support for female ex-combatants; gender-sensitive budgeting; and increasing access o f
girls and women to social services.
I D A Resources

84.
I D A resources under the CAS are estimated at US%309 equivalent. As a post-conflict
country, Burundi i s currently receiving a special IDA allocation based on i t s Post-Conflict
Performance Indicator (PCPI). In FY08, Burundi received a total special IDA allocation o f special
drawing rights (SDR) 53.1 million. During IDA15 (FY09-FY11) it i s estimated that Burundi will
receive a total post-conflict IDA allocation o f about SDR157 million (about US$253 million), with
an average annual allocation o f about SDR 52 million (US$84 million). However, since Burundi i s
currently in the phase-out period o f the post-conflict allocation, the annual amounts would be higher
in the early years and lower in the later years. In FY12, Burundi will receive the last year o f its
special post-conflict allocation, estimated at around SDR 35 million (US$56.3 million), before it will
graduate to the normal Performance-Based Allocation (PBA) amount, which depends on annual
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores and IDA project portfolio quality. The
amounts for outer years are indicative only. The actual annual allocations during the CAS period will
depend on: (i)total IDA resources available and the number o f post-conflict and IDA-eligible
countries; (ii)Burundi’s o w n performance, as measured by i t s PCPI; and (iii)Burundi’s performance
relative to other IDA-eligible and post-conflict countries. The US dollar equivalent o f any year’s
SDR allocation depends on the prevailing exchange rate.
85.
To increase I D A availability, the government needs to improve its performance, as
measured by PCPI and CPIA scores, and the performance o f IDA-financed projects. Without
such an improvement, Burundi’s IDA allocation will drop once the post-conflict IDA allocation
phases out completely in FY12. The CPIA assesses quality o f policies and institutions in three
categories: economic management, policies for social inclusion and equity, and public sector
management and institutions. The Bank will help the government improve PCPI and CPIA scores
through AAA, including the recent PEMFAR and technical assistance to strengthen governance, and
through selected operations, such as the proposed development policy operations and the proposed
Public Enterprise and Financial Sector Reform Project. The Bank will also carry out annual CPPRs
jointly with the government to identify project bottlenecks and improve project portfolio quality.
86.
Regional projects will allow Burundi to leverage its country I D A allocation. Under IDA
rules, regional projects are funded one-third by the country’s IDA allocation, and two-thirds by an
IDA regional integration allocation. In addition, for a small country l i k e Burundi, the percentage
contributed to regional projects i s capped at 20 percent o f the country annual IDA allocation.

-20-

B. CAS Outcomes and the Proposed Program of Support
The CAS will focus on six outcomes. The relationship between CAS strategic objectives and
87.
outcomes i s shown in Figure 2.
CAS Instruments

88.
Analytical and advisory activities. (See Table 3 and Annex 11). The Bank will undertake,
in partnership with the government and donors, core AAA diagnostics; AAA related to CAS
objectives; and just-in-time policy notes as needed. In undertaking AAA, the Bank will emphasize
government ownership and donor partnership to ensure that findings are internalized and translated
into actions and results.
89.
IDA-financed operations. (See Table 4 and Annex 12). Under the four-year CAS, the World
investment operations and four development policy
Bank will finance about eight projects-four
operations (see para. 90). The Bank will provide additional financing to scale up successful
interventions. In addition, the Bank will finance two to three regional investment operations that
involve Burundi.

Budget support. Development policy operations are expected to account for about 25-30
percent o f annual IDA financing, supporting macroeconomic stability and PRSP implementation.
The Second Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG II)which
,
will be presented to the Bank’s
Executive Directors together with this CAS, builds on the experience o f the ERSG (FY06) and
focuses on three areas: (i) PFM reforms to improve transparency and accountability o f public
spending; (ii) business and legal environment reforms to foster private sector development; and (iii)
coffee subsector reforms to increase exports and farmer incomes. The ERSG I1 i s the first in a
programmatic series o f two grants. Based on ERSG I1 and I11 experience, the Bank and the
government will design a second series for FY 1 1 and FY 12. The Bank will continue to work closely
with other development partners involved in the “Partnership Framework” to improve the
predictability o f budget support and lower transaction costs that tax Burundi’s limited capacity.

Strategic Objective One: Promote Sustainable and Broad-Based Economic Growth
91.
Expected results: T o promote sustainable and broad-based economic growth, the World
Bank Group will focus on three CAS outcomes:
1.1:Increased productivity o f food and high-value export crops;
1.2:Improved business environment;
1.3 Improved infrastructural services with enhanced regional integration.

CAS Outcome 1.1: Increased productivity of food and high-value export crops
92.
Analytical and advisory activities. The Bank has supported extensive studies on the rural
sector over the past few years, culminating in: Breaking the Cycle-A Strategy for Conflict-Sensitive
Rural Growth in Burundi (FY08). This study underpins the Bank’s work on agriculture. A Country
Economic Memorandum, planned for FY 10, will deepen the analyses o n the sources, opportunities,
and constraints to growth and provide policy recommendations, and it will update the Bank’s
analytical work on agriculture.
93.
IDA-financed operations. The ongoing Agriculture Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land
Management Project (FY05) focuses o n the domestic agricultural sector, seeking to increase crop and
livestock production and productivity, diversify farm income, support farmers’ organizations, and
promote sustainable land use. The project i s well performing and disbursing ahead o f schedule; and
the Bank approved additional financing o f US$15 million in FY08 to scale up activities and to react
to the impact o f soaring food prices. A follow-up agriculture project i s planned for FY 10 to continue
to increase domestic agricultural productivity and to promote high-value exports, especially coffee.
The ongoing Economic Management Support Project (FY04) continues to finance technical
assistance for agricultural reforms, especially to increase coffee production and farmer income. The
ERSG I1 (FY09, together with this CAS) and ERSG I11 (FY 10) support key coffee and tea subsector
reforms. Transport projects (see paras. 104-105) will help reduce transport costs for marketing both
domestic and export agricultural products. To mitigate climate-related risks, the Bank will explore
support to Burundi from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery.
94.
International Finance Corporation. IFC, working with IDA and other partners, will
explore how to assist the coffee industry, such as by facilitating farmer ownership o f washing
stations, providing training and other support to coffee producer organizations, establishing market
linkages, and facilitating financing through a risk-sharing facility to a local bank.
Regional operations. Burundi i s expected to participate in phase two o f the regional Lake
95.
Victoria Environmental Management Project (FY lo), which will address land degradation in the
Kagara river catchment through community-driven investments that improve land management.
Burundi i s a member o f the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and
Central Africa (ASARECA). The Bank and ASARECA are developing a regional operation to
support shared agricultural research that would increase agricultural productivity. Burundi could
participate in the regional operation, likely in the late CAS period or under the next CAS.
96.
Development Partners. Given the importance o f agriculture to Burundi’s economy, there
are many sources o f support, including AfDB, Belgium, EU, IFAD, and UN agencies such as the
Food and Agriculture Organization, and USAID. During CAS consultations, development partners
voiced interest in moving toward a sector-wide approach in agriculture (see B o x 6). In addition,
development partners intend to establish a “coffee working group” to better support government
efforts to reform and strengthen the coffee sector.
- 23 -

CAS Outcome 1.2: Improved business environment
97.
Analytical and advisory activities. The Bank and the government completed an Investment
Climate Assessment in late FY08 and will follow up with an action plan for improving the business
climate. The Bank also produced in FY08 a technical note o n Public Enterprises and Commercial
Banks. The C A S anticipates a joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in
FY09 to identify financial system strengths and weaknesses and to enable the government to develop
and implement a strategy to increase the system’s contribution to private sector development and
economic growth. Under the CAS, the Bank will also provide analysis and technical assistance to
support harmonization o f trade policies and frameworks at the regional level, including support for
the COMESA Infrastructure Fund to facilitate the development o f bankable regional infrastructure
projects.
98.
International Finance Corporation. IFC i s increasing its involvement in Burundi, and will
undertake a key role in supporting Outcome 1.2, through investments and through advisory services
to government and businesses. There i s potential for I F C participation in various investments,
including in agro-processing, real estate, and tourism. There i s a potentially significant role for IFC
in privatization, particularly in telecommunications and infrastructure. In the financial sector, IFC
will continue to support Burundian banks through the Global Trade Finance Program, a trade finance
guaranty facility. Through PEP-Africa, I F C will continue to provide managerial and funding support
to small and medium enterprises, including the Association o f Burundi Women Entrepreneurs. The
IFC Investment Climate Team, working closely with IDA-financed consultants, will help the
government undertake a range o f Doing Business reforms, including: finalize the investment code;
draft and implement a public private dialogue law; improve the Commerce Code and Companies
Law; and improve the performance o f the Commercial Court.
99.
MIGA. Although involvement in Burundi has so far been limited, MIGA’s strategy i s to give
priority to conflict-affected countries. Under the CAS, MIGA intends to work closely with the Bank
and IFC to identify new private and public-private investment projects as they arise, especially in the
infrastructure sector. MIGA will also seek opportunities in the agribusiness, manufacturing, and
services sectors; and opportunities could emerge from the government’s privatization agenda.
MIGA’s newly established Small Investment Program could be appropriate for Burundi, because it
offers a standardized package attractive to small and medium-sized investors; a quick underwriting
process; a single application form; and no application fee. It provides a guarantee up to US$10
million for new investments associated with the expansion, modernization, or financial restructuring
o f existing projects.
100. IDA-financed operations. The private sector development component o f the ERSG series
(FY09, FY lo), in close collaboration with I F C PEP-Africa, supports government efforts to reform
the business legal and institutional environment to foster private-sector-led growth. The ongoing
Economic Management Support Project (FY04) continues to finance technical assistance and studies
to underpin private sector development reforms. The CAS foresees a follow up technical assistance
project that focuses o n public enterprise and financial sector reform (FY IO). An ongoing IDF grant i s
helping the government modernize its mining code and strengthen its ability to negotiate investment
agreements that ensure fair distribution o f mining benefits.
101. Regional operations. A regional Trade Facilitation Project (FYOl), which established the
African Trade Insurance Agency, has providing insurance for employment-creating investments in
trade and in the beer and telecom sectors. Burundi could j o i n a potential second phase o f the
operation.
-24-

102. Development partners. The World Bank Group i s an important player supporting the
government to improve the business environment, along with other donors such as the Netherlands
and USAID. Belgium, the UK Department for International Development (DfID), and the UN are
supporting justice sector reforms. USAID, which provides substantial support to agribusiness, has
played a role in coordinating the private sector development donors’ group. The IMF i s providing
technical assistance to help the government strengthen banking supervision.

CAS Outcome 1.3: Improved infrastructural services with enhanced regional integration
103. Analytical and advisory activities. The Bank and the E A C secretariat recently completed
(FY08) a study o f non-tariff barriers to intraregional trade. Under the CAS, Bank AAA will continue
to facilitate economic integration by addressing issues pertaining to Burundi’s new membership to
the E A C and i t s path o f accession, such as revenue impact, trade, transport, adoption o f customs
union protocol, as well as the long-term impact o f the EPA signed between the EU and the E A C in
December 2007. The government has asked the Bank to evaluate the performance o f the petroleum
sector, which plays a key role in the economy, and to recommend actions to improve policy and
pricing mechanisms and to ensure security o f supply, The Bank will start the evaluation soon for
completion in FY09. In the power sector, the Bank i s undertaking an energy sector study to be
completed in FY09. The planned C E M (FY10) on sources o f growth i s expected to include an indepth analysis o f regional integration.
104. IDA-financed operations. The ongoing Road Sector Development Project (FY04) i s
restoring part o f the priority road network, generating employment for the rural poor, and improving
road sector institutional capacity. Under the CAS, additional financing in FY 11 would broaden the
experience o f the ongoing project and consolidate i t s impact on rural access and regional trade. In
FY08, Executive Directors approved the Multisectoral Water and Electricity Infrastructure Project,
which will exte,nd water services into selected peri-urban areas o f Bujumbura and rehabilitate the
primary electricity distribution network. The project also aims to improve governance in the water
and electricity sector by improving the financial management o f REGIDESO, the public utility for
electricity and water, and publicly disseminating information on i t s performance.
105. Regional operations. The ongoing Regional Communications Infrastructure Project (FY07)
aims to expand telecommunications access and reduce the cost o f connectivity to global information
and communications technology infrastructure. Under the CAS, the Bank will increasingly focus on
regional approaches to improving infrastructure services. A regional transport operation (FY 11)
would help consolidate Burundi’s integration to the E A C by developing an alternative transport link
that would build on the ,current and projected road improvements along the Central Corridor from
Dar es Salaam and the ongoing reform o f the Tanzanian railway. Burundi i s also expected to
participate in regional power operations related to the East Africa Power Pool.

106. Development partners. Other main donors in the transport sector are the EU and the African
Development Bank (AfDB). The World Bank shares i t s mission findings with other partners; and
plans to undertake joint supervision missions with the AfDB. The water component o f the recently
approved Multisectoral Water and Electricity Infrastructure Project (MWEIP) will extend water
services to selected periurban areas o f Bujumbura, while other donors led by Germany and the AfDB
focus on rural areas and secondary urban centers. Germany plays a central role in overall water sector
coordination. The MWEIP’s electricity component was designed to complement an AfDB-financed
project that rehabilitates existing hydropower generation plants. The Bank will focus on
rehabilitation o f the high voltage distribution network and substations, and finances feasibility studies
for small run-of-the-river hydropower plants, some o f which may be financed by the Government o f
the Netherlands. Also, the Government o f China will support a new hydropower generation plant.

Strategic Objective Two: Improve Access to Social Services and Consolidate Social Stability

107.

Expected results. The World Bank Group will focus on three CAS outcomes:
2.1 :Improved reintegration of ex-combatants and vulnerable groups;
2.2:More efficient and transparent public financial management;
2.3 Improved access to and quality of basic social services and decreased vulnerability to
HIVIAIDS.

Box 7: Youth in Burundi-A

Force for Positive Change?

According to international research, a large youth population, especially excluded young men, increases the risk of
conflict. In Burundi, youth (ages 15-30 according to the government's official definition) constitute the largest
segment of the population-30 percent. The World Bank recently completed a qualitative study to explore how youth
are faring in post-conflict Burundi. The study collected data through 376 in-depth interviews.

Findings:
Employment emerged as a key priority and a main constraint. All economic categories of youth are facing
barriers to securing a sustainable livelihood.
Despite many hardships, young people remain a positive force in Burundi. They display remarkable levels
of optimism, motivation, and perseverance.
They also exlzibit a strong sense of citizenship. They voiced concern and often anger over issues of
governance, accountability, and corruption; and they held strong views on combating corruption and
cronyism.
Tlre social reintegration of ex-combatants and child soldiers appears to have been positive overall. In both
towns and villages, ex-combatants within the youth age category had strong positive social ties.
These findings suggest that in Burundi, unlike many other countries, there may be a window of opportunity to
harness the positive values of youth to facilitate reconstruction, reconciliation, and good governance.

Recommendations:
Improve the quality and relevance of education.
Help youtlt jind a livelihood: (i) improve the formal and informal business environment; (ii) open pathways
for jobs through public works; (iii) improve traditional apprenticeships; and (iv) provide microfinance and
entrepreneurship training.
Help young people form families: (i) increase access to sexual and reproductive health; and (ii) support youth
training in parenting and life skills.
Empower youtlr to exercise citizenship through social accountability interventions.
Next steps: In July and August 2008, the World Bank and Government of Burundi will disseminate by radio the
findings of the youth study, together with the findings of the diagnostic study on governance and corruption. The
Bank will also organize workshops to discuss study findings with development partners and national and
international NGOs working on youth issues in Burundi, and with the UN Peace Building Fund, which has allocated
US$4.1 million to a Youth Enterprise Development Project. The World Bank will seek to support youth
employment under relevant IDA-financed operations, such as the Second Public Works Project (FY09) and the
Agriculture Project (FY 10).

CAS Outcome 2.1: Improved reintegration of ex-combatants and vulnerable groups

108. IDA-financed operations. An Emergency Demobilization, Reinsertion and Reintegration
(DRR) Program financed by IDA and the Multicountry Demobilization and Reintegration Program
(MDRP) Trust Fund has supported implementation o f the Arusha Peace Agreement, and the
government's letter o f Demobilization Policy that sets out to limit the national defense force to
25,000 soldiers. The government launched DRR implementation in early 2004, demobilizing over
26,000 ex-combatants. 'Although reintegration o f excombattants has outperformed DRR Program
targets, it i s important to further improve reintegration in order to sustain peace and stability. I t i s
also important to complete demobilization activities as set forth in the Letter o f Demobilization
policy, including combatants from the FNL-PALIPEHUTU. The CAS anticipates additional
financing (around US$10 million, although the amount will depend on needs) in FY09 for the DRR
Program along with a two-year extension that would support a restructured and more focused
program, particularly for the reintegration component. In order to maximize reintegration and
employment opportunities for returning ex-combatants and refugees, the Bank will promote an
integrated approach, building synergies among Bank-financed operations including in agriculture,
community development, and transport. The Bank will also finance a Second Public Works Project
(FY09) that will generate substantial local employment through labor-intensive infrastructure
rehabilitation, building o n the successful experience o f the first Public Works and Employment
Creation Project.
109. Development partners. The MDRP Trust Fund, which closes at the end o f 2008, i s
supported by thirteen donors: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the European Commission. This
partnership has enabled coordinated technical support and funding for the complex and sensitive
DRR Program. Discussions are underway between the government, the Bank, and other partners to
agree on modalities for further supporting the DRR Program and i t s link to security sector reform to
be supported by the UN and bilateral partners. The proposed additional IDA financing i s expected to
be complemented by a multi-donor single-country trust fund.
CAS Outcome 2.2: More efficient and transparentpublic financial management

110. Analytical and advisory activities. The Bank and the government completed a Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) in FY08. Under the
CAS, the Bank, in close collaboration with the government and interested development partners, will
undertake annual Public Expenditure Reviews (FY 10, FY 11, FY 12).
111. IDA-financed operations. Building on the PEMFAR, the P F M component o f the ERSG
series (FY09 and FY10) will help consolidate P F M reforms to improve fiscal transparency and
accountability, with the ultimate goal o f improving service delivery. ERSG I1 will focus on reforms
related to preparation, execution, and reporting o f the budget and internal audits. ERSG I11 will
follow up on these reforms and also focus on issues related to budgetary allocative efficiency. The
ERSG i s complemented by the ongoing Economic Management Support Project (FY04), a technical
assistance operation that includes a P F M component. The Bank i s supervising an IDF grant to
improve the institutional environment for mining and ensure equitable distribution o f benefits.
1 12. Development partners. In 2005, Burundi and donors established a Partnership Framework
to coordinate budget support. The Partnership Framework, which currently includes AfDB, Belgium,
EU, France, IMF, Netherlands, Norway, and the UNDP, also functions as a mechanism to coordinate
financial management reforms. The government will update i t s Financial Management Action Plan
based on the recent PEMFAR.

-27-

CAS Outcome 2.3: Improved access to and quality of basic social services and decreased
vulnerability to HIV/AIDS

113. Analytical and advisory activities. The Bank, working closely with government and other
donors, completed a study on education in FY06. The study underpinned project preparation and
provided the basis for an “education for all” program to be supported by several donors through a
basket fund mechanism. The Bank and the Ministry o f Health completed in FY06 an overall
assessment o f the health sector to identify major needs. Recently in FY08, the Bank and the Ministry
o f Health completed a Health Financing Study that assesses the challenges o f financing the sector,
including free services to women during delivery and children under five, and provides the basis to
move toward a sector-wide approach.
114. IDA-financed operations. The ongoing Community and Social Development Project,
approved in FY07, helps establish a transparent and participatory mechanism to finance community
subprojects on a demand-driven basis. In the education sector, the ongoing Education Sector
Reconstruction Project (FY07) aims to help the government implement i t s free primary school policy
by building the capacity o f schools to educate an increasing number o f students. The Bank’s
Executive Directors approved a Second Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project in May 2008. IDA
financing for HIV/AIDS in Burundi i s relatively modest yet helps fill an immediate financing gap
and i s one o f the only sources o f financing for certain prevention and multisectoral activities. The
recently approved project builds on the successful experience o f the first Multisectoral HIV/AIDs
Control and Orphans Project, implemented from FY02 to FY09. Under the CAS, the Bank and other
partners will move toward a sector-wide approach (SWAp) for the health sector. The Bank intends to
finance a Health Project (FY09) to support the SWAP and help the government implement i t s policy
o f eliminating health user fees for pregnant women and women under five.
115. Regional operation. The ongoing HIV/AIDS Great Lakes Initiative Project (FY05) finances
regional prevention activities targeting mobile and vulnerable groups, including refugees and
transport sector workers, to stem cross-border transmission.
116. Development partners. In the education sector, development partners, including Belgium,
France, DBD, and UN agencies, have worked together closely, including through joint field
missions, to establish a SWAP to support the government’s National Sector Plan, providing a model
o f effective aid delivery for other sectors. In the health sector, main donors are Belgium, EU, DfID,
GAVI, Global Fund, Switzerland, USAID, and UN Agencies, particularly, UNICEF, WHO, and
UNFPA. The World Bank i s working closely with all partners to move towards a SWAp, which will
comprise an agreement on financing the government’s health program, a single results matrix, and
joint missions. The first partners’ joint mission in the sector took place in October 2007.

Box 8: Diagnostic Study on Governance and Corruption
At the request o f the President o f Burundi, the World Bank Institute (WBI), with financial support from the
Government o f Belgium, assisted the government to undertake a diagnostic survey on public experience and
perception o f governance and anti-corruption (GAC) in Burundi.
Under the leadership o f the Ministry o f Good Governance, the government established a GAC Steering Committee
representing both government and civil society to oversee the survey. An independent polling fm initiated field
work in November 2007, submitting questionnaires to over 3,000 people, including households, government
officials, NGOs, and private enterprise employees.
Main perceptions of survey participants:
Corruption i s a main concern and has increased in recent years. Corruption i s one o f the top five concerns
of all categories surveyed, along with unemployment, poverty, access to land, and access to water and
electricity. More than one half those surveyed from NGOs, private enterprises, and public administration and
more than one quarter from households believe that corruption has increased since the Arusha Peace
Agreement.
Access to basic services is limited, and bribes for access are common. More than half the households
surveyed reported unavailability or poor quality o f basic services. Less than 50% reported having access to safe
drinking water, and indicated that bribes were needed to obtain access.
Police, customs, tax collection, public procurement, and the justice system are particularly prone to
corruption. The police were identified by all categories as the most frequent recipient o f bribes.
Public officials are hired based on political party affiliation or personal connections rather than technical
competence. Also, bribes are paid for some positions. Over 90% o f public employees surveyed believe that
recruitment in their sector i s based on political criteria.
Next steps:

The GAC Steering Committee submitted the survey results to the Council o f Ministers in June 2008 for approval.
Following government approval, survey results will be publicly disseminated through national workshops and local
radio, together with the results o f the recent qualitative study on youth. On the basis o f the results o f the GAC survey
and the PEMFAR, the government, in consultation with civil society, will formulate a GAC strategy, including a
short-term action plan with measurable results.
In response to survey results, the GAC Steering Committee proposed to apply the Rapid Results Initiative (see para.
120) to education, justice, and the electricity and water utility as an instrument to motivate and engage civil servants
to implement specific action plans that will show improvements in the short term.

Cross-Cutting Objective: Governance

117. Given the cross-cutting nature of governance, the Bank will address governance at
three levels:

(i)At the project level, the Bank will ensure procedures and systems t o minimize fiduciary
and governance risks inherent in operations. In addition, the Bank will improve the
governance o f projects themselves, including ensuring competitive staff recruitment,
clear and transparent procedures, and public communication o n project budgets and
objectives. Annual CPPRs will focus on results and governance.

(ii)At the sector level, the Bank will help improve governance in sectors where the Bank i s
involved. For example, the recently approved Multisectoral Water and Electricity
Infrastructure Project aims to strengthen financial management and accountability o f
REGIDESO, the public utility for water and electricity. The Bank will encourage sector-

-29-

wide approaches that aim to strengthen institutions, systems, procedures, and
transparency. Sector-wide approaches will also improve donor coordination, avoiding
overlaps or inconsistencies that can weaken institutions.
(iii)At the macro level, the Bank will emphasize more effective and transparent public
financial management (CAS Outcome 2.2) and will help strengthen core governance
institutions. Also, the Bank will assist the government develop in early FY09 an updated
governance and anti-corruption strategy and prioritized action plan, using both the
recently completed P E M F A R and the diagnostic study o n governance and corruption (see
B o x 8). The Bank will also engage at the political level through high-level discussions to
support better governance by minimizing interference in economic decisions.
118. The Bank will strengthen its partnerships with civil society, academia, think tanks, and
the media to help increase the demand for good governance. The Bank will also encourage the
design o f projects that work directly with and strengthen representative citizens’ institutions, such as
village councils. Youth, who have a strong sense o f citizenship and views against corruption, could
contribute to bringing about better governance (see B o x 8).
119. Under the CAS, I D A operations will identify contributions to improve governance and
will consider governance-related indicators. For example, the ongoing Community and Social
Development Project will help strengthen governance at the commune level, and will track the
transparency o f microproject procurement, the use o f community scorecards and other mechanism
for citizen feedback, and independent media coverage and scrutiny o f project-financed investments.
120. The W B I will continue to support leadership and better governance. The WBI, supported
by a LICUS Trust Fund, introduced the Rapid Results Initiatives (RRI) methodology in late 2006 to
help the public administration learn how to tackle specific problems and show results within 100
days. The RRI methodology i s being used to improve governance in selected service delivery sectors:
water, electricity, education, and justice. RRI will be expanded to additional sectors and will support
implementation o f the G A C strategy.

C. Strengthening Donor Harmonization
121. Acknowledging the need to improve aid effectiveness, the government and donors have
recently launched a new donor coordination structure. In late 2005, the government established a
National Committee o n Aid Coordination (ComitB National de Coordination des Aides, CNCA),
chaired by the Second Vice President and comprising several key ministers. However, limited
capacity hindered i t s ability to coordinate and monitor donor assistance. To strengthen C N C A
capacity, the government established a technical-level C N C A Permanent Secretariat in February
2006. In March 2007, several donors held a retreat in Bujumbura to agree on approaches to improve
coordination. Donors and the government reviewed Rwanda’s experience with its Development
Partner Coordination Group. At the Round Table meeting in M a y 2007, the government announced
the creation o f a Partners’ Coordination Group (PCG) to ensure donor alignment to the PRSP, and to
build capacity o f local institutions to monitor and evaluate progress towards the Paris Declaration.
The C N C A was appointed as the Secretariat o f the PCG and i s responsible for its overall
administration.
122. The PCG, which will be operational by the end o f 2008, will be structured in layers.
Ministers will chair monthly meetings that involve one or more representatives o f the donor
community. Quarterly meetings, chaired by the vice-presidents and attended by development
partners, will discuss PRSP implementation. Strengthening C N C A capacity i s key for the functioning

- 30 -

o f the PCG. The C N C A presented an action plan to donors in December 2007. Development partners
are establishing a basket fund to be managed by the U N D P to finance the implementation o f the
C N C A action plan, including technical assistance.
123. PCG effectiveness will depend on the availability of coherent sector strategies. Sector
strategies for education, health, and public finance management have enabled good donor
coordination. Joint Memorandum o f Understandings (MOUs) have been signed between the
government and relevant donors for health and budget support. The MOU lays out the sector
objectives, expected results, monitoring and evaluation arrangements, and donors’ commitments for
funding and technical support. In order to improve donor coordination in other sectors, such as
agriculture, transport, and private sector development, the government and donors have agreed to
speed up the formulation o f strategies.
124. The government i s implementing a web-based aid management platform, in partnership
with Development Gateway and funded by the Swiss Development Cooperation and GTZ. The aid
management platform, operated by the CNCA, will help the country produce aggregate reports on
external aid and monitor aid alignment with the PRSP and Strategic Framework for Peacebuilding.
125. The Bank will support efforts to strengthen donor harmonization, in accordance with the
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and with the Principles for Good International Engagement in
Fragile States (2005). A Bank mission will take place in FY09 to analyze current aid effectiveness
and help the government monitor progress in relation to the five partnership commitments o f the
Paris Declaration. The Bank, with the support o f a Belgian trust fund, i s helping the PRSP secretariat
improve the PRSP results framework to better monitor PRSP progress and link aid to national
priorities. The Bank i s also seeking an IDF grant to strengthen Burundi’s institutional capacity to
lead donor harmonization.

D. Implementing and Monitoring the Country Assistance Strategy
126. The Bank will continue to move away from stand-alone project implementation units
(PIUs). Several ongoing projects are implemented through government structures, notably the Road
Sector Development Project and the newly approved Multisectoral Electricity and Water Project.
127. The Bank will continue to strengthen its Burundi Country Office. I t currently comprises
twenty staff and consultants, including specialists in DDR, economics, health, infrastructure, poverty
monitoring, poverty monitoring, and procurement. In FY09, the Bank intends to add specialists in
agriculture and financial management. As capacity increases, the Bank will continue to devolve
portfolio management to country office-based staff. Given Burundi’s challenging implementation
environment, it will also be important to ensure adequate budget for project preparation and
supervision. Joint supervision missions with other development partners will increase aid
effectiveness and reduce transaction costs for the government, and could also be cost effective.
128. The CAS Results Framework presents the results chain for the Bank’s program of
support (see Annex 13). The CAS outcomes will be monitored jointly by the Bank and the
government over the CAS period. The framework uses Burundi’s PRSP as i t s starting point, and
narrows down the range o f outcomes to those that the Bank can demonstrably influence over the
CAS period. Since most o f the new operations foreseen in this CAS will likely not finish
implementation until after 2012, results during this CAS period will come mainly from existing
operations and the quicker-disbursing interventions included in the CAS.

-31 -

129. The Bank will carry out annual results-based CPPRs, building on the matrix of actions
from the recent CPPR. CPPRs will be conducted with development partners when possible.
Quarterly portfolio reviews will take place with government counterparts to assess implementation of
the CPPR action plan.

130. The Bank will prepare a CAS Progress Report in 2010 to evaluate progress toward CAS
outcomes and adjust strategy and program. The Progress Report will be completed after
Burundi’s national elections in 20 10 to allow consideration o f new government policy. Adjustments
to projects under implementation will be reflected in revised project results frameworks. A CAS
Completion Report will be prepared at the end o f the CAS period.

VI. R I S K S AND MITIGATION
13 1. There are high risks in the strategy o f moving from post-conflict rehabilitation to economic
and social development. There are even higher risks in not moving forcefully on that path. An
unstable Burundi could have ripple effects in a fragile international neighborhood.
132. Continued insecurity or renewed conflict i s a principal risk. Burundi has an opportunity
to exit the conflict trap, but faces formidable challenges. Continued insecurity in rural areas impedes
development and deters a reduction in security sector expenditures to create the fiscal space for propoor spending, as needed for lasting peace. Recent steps by the government and the FNLPALIPEHUTU, the last rebel group, to implement the 2006 cease fire agreement are a cause for
cautious optimism. Support from the international community i s crucial, including continued
resources for demobilization and reintegration o f ex-combatants. The window o f opportunity may
close rapidly, however, as elections in 2010 may stir up tensions among communities and political
groups. It will also be important to carefully manage the return o f 120,000 refugees, mainly from
Tanzania, over the next 24-30 months.
133. Political instability, especially in the run up to elections in 2010, could hamper
investment and structural reform. Although Burundi has made political progress since 2000,
international experience indicates that electoral democracy per se does not reduce the risk o f conflict;
and elections can sometimes increase conflict risk. Intraparty divisions contribute to political
instability and lead to frequent changes in key technical positions in the government. The Bank’s
recent CPPR identified government staff turnover as an impediment to project implementation. The
current political landscape underscores the importance o f ensuing broad ownership o f reforms and
investments. The Bank will also work with the government to minimize changes in project technical
staff.
134. A weak governance environment constitutes another major risk for economic recovery
and CAS implementation. It undermines stability, service delivery, and private sector development.
Further high-level governance incidents could disrupt budget support, as happened in 2007. The
government has taken steps to close PFM loopholes, but much remains to be done. In this context, it
i s challenging to ensure that projects adhere to core fiduciary and safeguard requirements. The Bank
will mitigate fiduciary and safeguard risks through close supervision and portfolio monitoring and by
designing projects to minimize fiduciary weaknesses.
135. The country’s medium-term economic outlook has significant downside risks. These
include possible delays in key structural reforms that underpin the growth objective. Mishandled
integration into the E A C could undermine domestic tax collection. The country i s at risk of
unsustainable debt dynamics. Burundi’s dependency on aid makes it vulnerable to delays or declines
in donor assistance, such as the case in 2007, when a corruption scandal caused a delay in completing
the sixth and last review o f the IMF PRGF arrangement, delaying aid disbursements and
complicating budget execution.
136. As a landlocked food-deficit country, Burundi i s particularly vulnerable to rising food
and fuel prices. Soaring prices could further jeopardize food insecurity and exacerbate malnutrition.
They could also increase social tensions and intensify wage demands. The Bank i s in the process o f
submitting a proposal for Burundi to the new Global Food Crisis Response Program Trust Fund.
Under the CAS, the Bank will help boost agricultural supply by supporting investments that improve
agricultural production, productivity, and diversification. Development partners are assisting with
targeted nutrition programs.

- 33 -

137. Capacity risks. Limitations in the technical capabilities o f the cabinet and c i v i l service to
design and implement the reform program are a source o f risk. The Bank will provide hands-on
support t o authorities, including from a strengthened W o r l d Bank country office in Bujumbura with
international and local staff covering agriculture, demobilization and reintegration, health, portfolio
management, poverty monitoring, procurement, and macroeconomics. The Bank will also undertake
a needs assessment to provide the basis for a strategic and coordinated capacity development
program.

138. Exogenous risks include weather, international prices, and security in neighboring
countries. Weather conditions have a strong influence o n the output o f the agricultural sector, as
demonstrated in 2003 and 2005. The proposed program in the agriculture sector seeks to reduce the
impact o f poor rainfall o n agriculture by increasing irrigation and disseminating drought resistant
plants, but this will take time. Sharp price changes in world coffee markets are difficult to manage
and absorb in a poorly diversified economy. As a landlocked country, Burundi i s affected by the
security situation in neighboring countries. Recent events in Kenya following the controversial
election had a negative impact o n the f l o w o f goods between Mombasa and Burundi. The donor
community should be ready to provide timely additional support t o prevent exogenous factors from
derailing the reform program.

Annex 4: Status o f HIPC Completion Point Triggers
Trigger

Progress

1. PRSP: Preparation o f a full PRSP through a participatory process
and its satisfactory implementation for one year, as evidenced by an
Annual Progress Report that has been the subject o f analysis in a Joint
Staff Advisory Note.

The government used a participatory process to prepare a full PRSP,
which was published in September 2006 and discussed by the I M F
and World Bank Boards in March 2007. The PRSP permanent
secretariat i s preparing an annual progress report, and a first draft will
be available in mid-2008.

2. Macroeconomic stability: Maintenance o f macroeconomic stability
as evidenced by satisfactory performance under the PRGF-supported
program.

Macroeconomic developments over the past two years have been in
line with the PRGF-supported program, which has remained on track
except briefly in mid-2007. The IMF concluded the sixth and last
review o f the PRGF on January 22,2008.

3. Use o f budget savings resulting from HIPC-related debt-service
relief during the interim period: Use o f budgetary savings from debt
relief in accordance with the priorities identified at the decision point
and in the PRSP duly documented and discussed by a national
Independent Oversight Committee on a semiannual basis.

Budgetary allocations for priority spending targeting pro-poor
activities and projects have increased markedly. Since 2006, the
government has allocated more than 70 percent o f HIPC budget
savings to social sectors (education, health). The government
reactivated the HIPC Independent Oversight Committee in mid-2007
and it now meets regularly. In February-March 2008, the government
shared with development partners a draft report o f an audit o f HIPC
spending, and circulated a revised version in May 2008. The report
will be finalized in July 2008.

4. Public expenditure management: Establishment o f an integrated
public expenditure computerized system that provides a budget
monitoring and control system, in particular for poverty-related
spending, and the production o f at least two quarterly budget
execution reports based on the new unified budget nomenclature.

An integrated computerized expenditure management system
(SIGEFI) was put in place in January 2006 using the new budget
nomenclature. Quarterly budget execution reports have been produced
since mid-2006. The government i s working to improve the SIGEFI
system and the coverage and reliability o f the reports.

5. Governance measures and the delivery o f services in key sectors:
Completion for the education, health, and justice sectors o f (i)a
budget tracking exercise (budget monitoring) o f public spending on
the delivery o f pro-poor services; (ii)
an evaluation by users o f the
quality o f services provided; (iii)an evaluation by providers o f
constraints to effective delivery o f pro-poor services; and
(iv) preparation o f an action plan to address problems identified.

The surveys were completed by year-end and the preliminary analyses
by end-February 2008. An action plan i s being prepared and will be
available in July 2008.

6. Demobilization: Execution o f the National DDR Program in line
with the pace and final objectives set forth in the Letter o f
Demobilization Policy to the World Bank, dated 19 February, 2004.

The demobilization program made progress in 2004-05 but has
experienced delays since then. B y November 2007, 24,105 persons
had been demobilized. The objective, after integrating all forces, i s to
reduce the army to 25,000 men. However, about 17,300 persons were
absorbed into a new national police force instead of being
demobilized. Plans are being finalized for a new round of
demobilization in 2008 (FNL excluded), covering about 3,500 from
the army (FDN) and 4,500 from the national police. This would
reduce the F D N to about 25,000 and the police to about 15,000.
Following the May mission by the Bank DDR team, the Bank i s
evaluating the request o f the authorities to modify the completion
criteria o f this trigger in light o f the slow implementation o f the DDR
program, exacerbated by the April 2008 security situation.

7. Structural measures: Tendering for sale the state holdings in a
majority o f coffee washing stations.

[n November 2006 the government approved a detailed action plan for
*eform o f the coffee sector, elaborated with the support of the World
Bank. The action plan included: (i)a study o f the competitiveness o f
:he sector (done in 2007); (ii)identification and implementation of a
strategy for the sale o f main assets; and (iii)drafting of a liberalized
legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for the sector. Actions
(ii) and (iii)
were delayed but are being reprogrammed. The authorities
have recently requested that this trigger be redefined. The Bank and
the Fund agreed. The Bank i s finalizing a proposal to redefine this
trigger in coordination with the authorities and the Fund.

8. Social sectors
Education: Increase in the gross national enrollment rate in primary
schools from 74 percent in 2003/04 to 77 percent in 2006; and from
16 percent in 2003/04 to 18 percent in 2006 in secondary schools,
subject to the provision that the average increase in provinces with
lower than average enrollment rates in 2004 must be higher than the
increase in the national rate over the same time period.

The elimination o f primary school fees in September 2005 resulted in
a large increase in first grade enrollment, Primary school enrollment
rose from an estimated 80 percent in 2003-04 to 85 percent in 200405, about 101 percent in 2005-06, and 118 percent in 2 0 0 H 7 . The
enrollment in secondary school has reached 19 percent in 2 0 0 H 7 .
Preliminary analysis o f regional enrollment rates (administrative) data
provided by the government indicates an improvement.

Health: Increase in the national immunization rate for children o f less
than one year o f age from 75 percent in 2004 to 85 percent in 2006,
subject to the provision that the average increase in provinces with
lower-than-average immunization rates in 2004 must be higher than
the increase in the national rate over the same time period.

In June 2006 the Burundian Ministry o f Health organized a national
campaign for vaccination against measles with the support o f UNICEF
and WHO. At end-October 2007 preliminary data suggest BCG
coverage at 71 percent; polio 3 at 74 percent; DPT3 equivalent at 69
percent; and measles at 30 percent. Data for 2006 are poor and not yet
available for regional rates. According to the government, preliminary
analysis o f regional immunization rates (administrative) data indicates
an improvement.

9. Debt management: Production o f monthly external debt reports,
including projections for the upcoming three months, for at least six
months before the completion point.

A l l the reports through February 2008 were provided. Reports s t i l l
have reliability and coverage problems.
