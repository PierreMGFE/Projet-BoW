BRAZIL - COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2004-2007 CAS identified four major challenges that Brazil faced in achieving
inclusive and sustainable growth. On two of these - improving macro foundations and
equity - Brazil made great progress. On the other two - improving competitiveness and
environmental sustainability - progress was uneven. Thus, economic stability was
consolidated and growth was fast for the poor, although there is still room for
improvement in terms of economic growth.
During the CAS period the Bank consolidated its reputation as a valued partner for
Brazil, providing valuable financial, knowledge and technical services. Perhaps
inevitably, Bank support was effective in areas where Brazil did well and less effective
where Brazil was less successful.
This CPS represents both continuity and change. Continuity in that the CPS positions the
Bank as a partner for Brazil as it strives to meet its societal goals. And change because
the perception of the Government on these goals, and the way in which the Bank can
help, has changed.
The highest priority set by President Lula for his second term is to accelerate growth.
The Government's flagship program, the PAC (Accelerated Growth Program) recognizes
that investment in growth-supporting infrastructure has become a critical constraint to
growth. While the PAC is the highest priority, the Government is also committed to
consolidation and fbrther improvement in the other major areas of macro and public
sector foundations, equity and environmental sustainability.
This CPS is the Bank's response to a changed and evolving Brazil. The underlying
philosophy is that, in a large and sophisticated middle income country:
The Bank Group should not be engaging in areas where Brazil has the knowledge and
capacity to manage by itself;
The Bank Group cannot act as though it is a "shadow government" in Brazil,
attempting to respond to every challenge that Brazil faces;
The Bank Group should be engaging primarily with the long-run, path-setting
challenges where Brazil has not yet devised solutions and where international
experience can be of particular value. Brazilian leaders have identified such
"desafios paradigmaticos", or paradigmatic challenges;
The IFC and IBRD should work in a much more integrated fashion in addressing
these challenges; and
Baair d f i c work needs to focus less on the "what," more on the "how," and on
better integration of knowledge, lending and trust-funded activities.

In the last CAS period, IBRD lending was dominated by lending to the Federal
Government and by large DPLs. With rapid growth in reserves, the Federal Government
wants the focus of the IBRD program to change to one in which there is: (a) a strong
technical assistance program of modest size with the Federal Government; and (b) a
major lending program with states, on state priorities and in compliance with the Fiscal
Responsibility Law. This emerging state-dominated program is branded as one based on
"principled opportunism," in which Governors who are interested in working with the
Bank define their priorities, and in which the Bank brings a set of well-articulated
principles (based on analytic work and experience in Brazil and elsewhere) to the table.
Initial experience is that this modus operandi leads to Bank support of high quality on
"paradigmatic challenges" and that the strong political backing means that many longstanding implementation barriers are reduced. In this rapidly-evolving environment a
"four-year plan" makes little sense. The CPS thus focuses on defining "rules of
engagement" and describes some of the major operations which are expected in the next
two years.
The evolution of the IFC program is similar. The IFC has moved away from financing
Tier 1 companies, except in cases where: i) such financing is having a major
demonstration effect, ii) it is helping to create new standards with regards to corporate
governance and the environment, or iii) there is a significant south-south component.
IFC may also resume funding of tier I companies should there be a need for countercyclical financing. Otherwise, the trademark for IFC involvement will be with Tier 2
companies, with an emphasis on improvement of corporate and social and environmental
quality. In a substantial number of cases, detailed in this CPS, the IFC and the Bank will
work together, one on the private side and one on the public side.
Finally, Brazil sees strong synergy in the Bank's focus on "inclusive globalization" and
Brazil's emergence as a regional and global leader. For Brazil this means Bank
partnership in regional development in South America, and for Bank, partnership in
putting Brazil's leading role in critical issues such as conditional cash transfers,
agricultural research, clean energy and climate change. And it means the IFC working as
a partner in taking Brazilian companies global. For the Bank Group it means that Brazil
is also a provider of ideas, experience and even financing (as an IDA donor, for example)
for other members of the cooperative that is the World Bank Group.
The CPS identifies four types of risk, and measures to address these. The first is that the
shift to a State focus might weaken engagement with the Federal Government. Initial
experience, however, shows that engagement with the Federal Government has, if
anything, increased. The second possible risk is that Brazil's recent successes might
reduce the appetite for addressing some long-run challenges such as tax reform and social
security. Here the Bank has no option but to put the "principled" part of "principled
opportunism" to work, and to make sure that we are alert to, and engage, whenever
opportunities for addressing these difficult structural issues arise. Experience to date has
shown that doing this in a quiet, supportive-of-reformers mode can be effective. The
third risk on the domestic front relates to the quality of spending, especially of the
government's major infrastructure investment program. Here the Bank has been asked to

engage, and is engaging, in helping to improve the quality of public spending and
planning. External risks are not currently perceived as a major threat, given the excellent
quality of Brazil's debt, monetary and fiscal management practices. Finally, the risk to
the Bank of not pursuing a new and more flexible approach in one of our major MIC
clients is that of irrelevance. The flexibility and approach of the proposed CPS strategy
aims to help the Bank address this risk.

BRAZIL - COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
I.

A COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR A "BRIC"

1.
Like other continental countries (Russia, India and China), Brazil is a
sophisticated middle income country for the World Bank Group in light of:
Its achievements in many areas that are of great relevance to other countries of the
world: it is a world leader in many areas - agriculture, biofuels, hydropower, mining,
its AIDS program, conditional cash transfers, community driven development,
forestry management, the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL);
Its emerging leadership in the region and in the developing world;
For its central role in dealing with many global challenges (including AIDS, climate
change, biodiversity and clean energy);
The fact that it is a demanding borrower that "pushes the Bank Group to the next
level", by insisting that the Bank Group enter areas where it has been reluctant to
participate; that the Bank Group engage primarily with long-range, complex
development challenges; that the Bank Group develop new lending and financial
instruments to meet Brazil's evolving demands; that the Bank engage with global
challenges from the perspective of the developing world; that the IFC and IBRD work
in a more integrated way; and that the Bank become more flexible, faster and less
bureaucratic.
As the Bank Group has responded well to these demands in the past, other Bank's
2.
borrowers have benefited as Brazil-induced innovations have become general practice.
An effective response to Brazil's evolving challenges means that the Bank Group is now
seen by Brazil as a valued partner, with which Brazil wants to retain an important
partnership. This Country Partnership Strategy needs to be seen in this context: a) as the
result of an intensive process of joint work between the Government of Brazil and the
World Bank Group (with consultations with many other partners), and b) as the
manifestation, in one major MIC, of the ways in which the Bank Group can use its
instruments - lendipg, knowledge, seal of approval and convening power - to continue to
be a valued partner to the Bank's MIC owners.

11. BRAZIL'S ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE THE LAST CAS
3.
In 2004, when the last CAS was developed, President Lula's newly-elected
government faced several major challenges. There was deep concern (reflected in the
"risco Brasil" being 2300 points after his election in September 2002) regarding the
commitment of the Government to fiscal stability; Brazil had relatively low foreign
exchange reserves and was thus vulnerable to external shocks; and it was unclear how the
government would develop programs to meet its election commitment of attacking
inequality. Brazil's progress over the CAS period has been impressive in terms of
meeting these challenges. The country's fiscal outlook, debt situation and financial
sector health are far different than they were five years ago. The Government has

consolidated the country's commitment to fiscal responsibility, with the "risco Brasil"
down to about 200 basis points. On April 30, 2008, Brazil obtained an investment grade
rating from Standard & Poors, opening the way for a further acceleration of investment.
Brazil's reserves have grown to $190 billion, sufficient to cover 18 months of
4.
imports and 280 percent of short-term foreign debt. The commitment to a high primary
surplus and improvement of debt management along with reduction of the debt/GDP ratio
has helped to significantly reduce the vulnerability of public finances to adverse shocks.
The vulnerability of public debt to exchange rate fluctuations has reduced dramatically,
the share of fixed-rate instruments and average maturity increased substantially, and the
external debt linked to foreign currency has been gradually substituted by local currency
fixed-income instruments debt issued both in the domestic and Eurobond markets. The
recent merger of the Siio Paulo Stock Exchange (BOVESPA) and the BM & F
(Commodities, Futures and Derivatives Exchange) makes Brazil' consolidated exchange
one of the top five in the world. While overall growth has been slow until recently, the
incomes of the poor have grown very fast - at Chinese-level rates of 9 percent a year
since 2000 (Figure 1, See also Annex 2 on poverty reduction and recent economic
developments and sustainability).

Fiscal consolidation at the state level has also contributed to a stronger
macroeconomic situation. Implementation of the FRL, in conjunction with a prudent
fiscal stance on the part of states and municipalities has resulted in a significant decline in
sub-national indebtedness.
However, as with most other countries, the glass is also half empty. Despite
6.
highly favorable external conditions and historically high commodity prices, economic

I

growth has been slow. And there has been mixed success in dealing with deforestation
and other major environmental challenges.

111.

THE BANK GROUP'S CONTRIBUTION

7.
The World Bank Group played a supporting role beyond its small financial
contribution (an annual average of about $500 million of IFC lending - including
financing raised from commercial banks, $50 million of MIGA guarantees and $1500
million of IBRD lending, in a $1,000 billion economy.) Arguably the most important
factor of the Bank Group's strategy for Brazil was its commitment to the priorities of the
Government of President Lula. The Bank also played a central advisory and financial role
in Brazil's flagship poverty program (Bolsa Familia), adding both credibility and
knowledge (and some finance). In 2003-2004, IFC played an important role in helping to
reactivate trade financing lines and in keeping confidence in the private sector.

8.
The World Bank's program was organized in the form of four pillars (Figure 2).
Mirroring Brazil's successes (and failures), the Bank's program was successful in
supporting social programs that helped initiate a long overdue move towards a more
equitable Brazil and was more mixed in terms of sustainability and improving the
performance of the public sector. The Bank did not contribute greatly to making Brazil
more competitive. (See Annex 9 for the 2004-2007 CAS Completion Report).

Digging slightly deeper into the Bank Group's lending program (Figures 3 and 4)'
the following additional conclusions emerge:
The Bank's program was primarily a Federal Program, dominated by quickdisbursing loans. There was substantial innovation in developing instruments (the

"Brazilian-style SWAP") whereby the Bank supported Government programs.
Lending was low in the last year of the CAS, as the new government re-visited and
revised its strategy.

While IBRD lending to states was moderate, it grew in the latter years of the CAS,
and started to address some complex development issues such as the quality of public
sector management using highly-innovative, results-oriented instruments.
IFC's program focused on four main areas - development of financial markets,
infrastructure, manufacturing and agribusiness, in addition to promoting sustainability
as a cross-cutting theme.
MIGA had a small and focused program, with a total of $170 million, all in electricity
transmission.

BRAZIL'S CURRENT CHALLENGES

All challenges are not of equal importance and not all challenges can be addressed
10.
at once. The Brazilian electorate delivered a clear message in 2006 confirming that there
was broad support for the Government's demonstrated commitment to fiscal
responsibility (and resulting low inflation) and to support for the poor. The Government
interpreted the mandate to be "consolidate the gains (in fiscal stability and poverty
reduction) but move aggressively to get the economy growing again". President Lula has
characterized his second term as one in which he will be "obsessed by growth".
11.
There is recent evidence that the sound macroeconomic management and
improvements in debt sustainability are helping to reinvigorate growth. However,
primary fiscal surpluses have been based on very high levels of taxation and sharp
reductions of public investment. There is currently no more space for tax increases and
the Government has had difficulty in curbing current expenditures. On the external side,
the situation appears much stronger with high levels of foreign reserves, a net creditor
position and trade and current account surpluses. For the time being, appreciation of the
Real has had positive effects (increased productivity as a result of increased purchases of
machinery and equipment from abroad), but further appreciation may eventually begin to
affect the competitiveness of Brazilian exports. Finally, there is some possibility that
volatility in international financial markets will have an influence on both interest rates
and inflation, making the environment for growth slightly more difficult.
Nevertheless, over the CPS period (2008-201 I), Brazil is likely to sustain the
12.
growth rates at the 4-4.5 percent range (see Table 1). On the external side, the strong

exchange rate appreciation and weaker international demand are likely to reduce trade
and current account balances. In addition, with greater domestic absorption it is expected
that the current account will shift from surpluses to small deficits in the coming years.
However, the solid external position characterized by very low external indebtedness and
high international reserves will guarantee Brazilian external sustainability. Weaker
global growth over the CPS period is not expected to affect commodity prices
significantly enough to change this assessment. In addition, the flexible exchange rate
would cushion any possible adverse external shocks, and ongoing diversification of
exports should diminish negative impacts of growth deceleration in developed
economies.

13.
On the fiscal front, the Government is committed to maintaining the robust
primary surpluses achieved in the last eight years. The maintenance of primary
surpluses, higher growth prospects and declining interest rates will continue to reduce
total deficits. Public debt should continue to shrink. However, since taxes cannot be
increased much further, in the absence of reforms to curb current expenditure growth the
Government could face increasing difficulties in achieving these targets. Nonetheless,
higher growth and reduction of interest payments would reduce the necessity of tax
increases and would slightly broaden the fiscal space for government investment while
guaranteeing fiscal sustainability. Inflationary prospects are also favorable and inflation
should converge to the mid point set at 4.5 percent by the Central Bank for the next three
years.

The structural causes of Brazil's relatively slow economic growth are varied and
14.
relate to a variety of issues that affect total factor productivity. There is broad agreement
that critical areas for reforms are:
The high level of taxation and low quality of public spending. The high tax burden
provides strong disincentives to private investment, formal sector employment, and
economic growth. The quality of government spending in Brazil suffers due to
weak public sector management and institutional arrangements (where Brazilians,
in the words of a former Vice Minister of Finance "pay for five stars, and get a
three star service").
Inadequate labor institutions and legislation. The Brazilian labor market is affected
by relatively inflexible labor legislation. Labor legislation in Brazil is heavily
biased towards job security, resulting in low growth of employment and
productivity in favor of growth of the informal labor market and low labor
productivity.
High interest rates. Average lending interest rates remain high in Brazil and were
close to 30 percent in real terms in 2007 (one of the highest in the world). There are
still barriers to a more efficient financial intermediation, including the large size of
government borrowing, directed credit schemes that account for about a third of
total bank lending, and less-than efficient public banks.
Business environment. Starting a business, registering property and paying taxes in
Brazil are more time consuming and costly than the average for Latin America (and
even higher than other regions). Some states in Brazil have already started to
simplify procedures for registering businesses, including one-stop shops, but the
overall process remains costly and lengthy in most states.
Lack of investment and poor quality of infrastructure, where spending and service
have declined dramatically. Total public investment has fallen to less than one
percent of GDP in the period 2001-2007 from about 4 percent of GDP in the 1980s.
(Figure 5).
The Federal Government has chosen to focus its "obsession with growth" on one
15.
of the determinants of slow growth - the quality and quantity of infrastructure. The
Government's flagship Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) is an infrastructure
program. The PAC attempts to address the issue of slow economic growth through
increased public investment in infrastructure and increased public credit. Public
infrastructure spending during 2007-2010 has been projected by the Ministry of Finance
to reach over R$500 billion (more than half going to energy projects). Since most of this
would go through public (federal) enterprises this increase will not affect general
government fiscal targets, as such transactions are not included in general government
accounts. The PAC focuses on stimulating public credit for housing and long-term
infrastructure investment. In addition, PAC measures include an increase in Federal
Government funding through the Caixa Econornica Federal (CEF) for housing and
sanitation and through the National Bank of Economic and Social Development
(BNDES) and the creation of a Infrastructure Investment Fund (Fundo de Investimento
em Infra-Estructura), again with no impact on general government accounts.

At the State level, Brazil's twenty-seven governors face widely differing
challenges, and have formulated different responses to these challenges. Nevertheless,
there are some discernible similarities among priorities at the Federal and State levels.
Most governors are equally concerned with growth, inclusion, and improving the quality
of the infrastructure in their states. In some regions (most notably the Northeast) this
concern is coupled with concerns about getting small farmers to market. In other regions
(notably the Center-West and the Amazon) a major concern is how to reconcile
development with conservation. Many governors, inspired in good part by the
innovative, results-oriented Bank-supported programs with Ceara and Minas Gerais, are
also giving high priority to improving the quality of public sector management.
17.
The prudent fiscal stance adopted by both states and municipalities, combined
with improved revenue growth performance, resulted in a significant decline in
subnational indebtedness and has opened space for the recovery of government
investment at the subnational level'. The effectiveness of the set of controls on
subnational fiscal performance (debt renegotiation contracts, FRL constraints and the
restrictions affecting domestic credit supply) has led to a pronounced improvement in
subnational indebtedness indicators since 2003 (Table 2). Subnational debt fell from 18
percent of GDP in 2003 to 14.6 percent of GDP in 2007. The reduction of debts covered
under the refinancing agreements of 1989, 1993 and 1997) will lead to a strong reduction

of debt service obligations and will permit subnational governments to access to credit
operations (that were drastically restricted in recent years). Thus, lower debt service
obligations and greater access to new borrowing would lead to a more robust increase of
investment.

HOW THE BANK GROUP IS ASKED TO HELP
A.

AREAS OF FOCUS

18.
The Bank Group is a niche player in Brazil, providing about $2 billion of
financing a year in an economy of $1,000 billion. To get some perspective, the National
Development Bank (BNDES) provides about $35 billion of financing each year. The
central challenge for Bank Group engagement is selectivity. There are several principles
that provide guidance for areas where the Bank Group should, and should not, engage:
The Bank should not be engaging in areas where Brazil has the knowledge and
capacity to manage by itself;
The Bank cannot act as though it is a "shadow government" in Brazil, engaging in
every challenge that Brazil faces;
Bank analytic work needs to focus less on the "what", more on the "how", and on
better integration of knowledge, lending and trust-funded activities; and
The Bank Group should be engaging primarily with the long-run, path-setting
challenges where Brazil has not yet devised solutions and where international
experience can be of particular value. Brazilian leaders have identified "desafios
paradigmaticos", or paradigmatic challenges.
19.
In the preparation of this CPS there have been extensive discussions with
Government, the private sector and others on which "desafios paradigmaticos" should be
the focus of Bank Group engagement, and of the higher-value targets within the
"desafios" that will be the particular focus of Bank Group attention (See Annexes 3 and
4).

20.
Some examples in important areas illustrate how the Bank will engage in the
higher value-added end of these paradigmatic challenges (and disengage from those
where Brazil does not need Bank engagement).
21.
First consider the challenge of education. In the last CAS, the focus was on
extending coverage. In part due to the substantial achievements in this area by Brazil, the
Bank will no longer focus on expanding the coverage of education. Now the focus of the
Bank work will be on the challenges of improving education systems (building on
widely-acknowledged AAA work in this area) and on aligning federal and state
interventions in states. The Bank will support a focus on improved performance and
accountability, as well as on improving the contribution of education to innovation and
growth, again at both the Federal and State levels.
22.
Second, consider the challenge of reducing endemic poverty in the Northeast.
Over the past decade the states of the Northeast, with Bank support, have developed a
model of community development which is based on passing funds directly to
community associations, and having these associations set priorities for use of these
resources. These projects have been successful, both in building social capital and in
enabling poor communities to get access to water and electricity. The overwhelming
demand, now, fkom the communities (and the governors of the Northeast) is for economic
inclusion. The focus of Bank Group engagement in this next CPS period is thus on
strengthening community-level productive activities and their integration into the
economy. The core approach for the Bank Group is to identify demands fkom major
firms (such as supermarkets and others - both in Brazil and abroad), and then to specify
productive arrangements, which will enable communities to provide the required
products at scale, with reliability and with quality assured. An important start has been
made, building on the social capital of these 37,000 communities, and bringing the full
range of IBRD and IFC expertise to bear.
23.
Third, consider the challenge of urban development. In the last CAS period an
important focus of the Bank was on upgrading of specific slums and financing of specific
water and drainage interventions. In part because of the availability of large sums of
Federal money (via the PAC) for such investments, but in larger part so that the Bank
engages at the "higher value end" of this challenge, Bank Group engagement with cities
will now focus on improving city management, city competitiveness and on introducing
results-oriented mechanisms for providing urban services. It is also foreseen that there
will be a focus on those cities that are central to broader economic growth (such as port
cities). IFC will complement the Bank's role by bringing private sector investment in the
cities via housing finance, PPPs in infrastructure, health and education. Furthermore IFC
advisory services together with FIAS, will help improve the business environment and
municipal fiscal prospects via administrative simplification
24.
Fourth, consider the Bank's engagement in the Amazon. As described in Box 1,
the Bank Group will reverse its de facto decades' long withdrawal from the financing of
development in the Amazon, and will become a full-service partner to the Federal
Government, the states and the private sector in reconciling conservation with

development. Similar principles will be applied to Bank engagement in other sensitive
biomes such as the pantanal.
Fifth, consider the example of public sector management, a pervasive and
25.
fundamental challenge where, in the words of a former Vice Minister of Finance,
"Brazilians pay for five-star service and get three-star service." There is a strong
demand, especially from the States, but also from some parts of the Federal Government,
for systemic institutional approaches that will improve the performance of the public
sector and the quality of public spending. The Bank has developed a strong brand-name
in this area in Brazil, and is working with state-of-the-art, large-scale operations on
results-based management with several states; with the social ministries that have very
large constitutionally-earmarked funds on improving the quality of spending; and with
the Ministry of Planning on modernizing budget procedures. In all cases the Bank is
invited in "at the high end" - to bring international experience and "how-to" knowledge
to bear. Intrinsic to this work is helping governments put into place the structural
underpinnings for public systems that will be more effective, efficient and that reduce
opportunities for corruption.
Finally, it is important to note that there is a large degree of convergence between
26.
the Bank's perception of areas where progress has been relatively slow (see Figure 2) and
the perception of the Government of Brazil. This means that "addressing areas where
performance was relatively weak in the last CAS period" takes place more or less
automatically since these are "desafios paradigmaticos" areas that the Federal and State
governments are focusing on and where there is a consequent demand for Bank .
Box 1: THEBANKGROUP'SAMAZONPARTNERSHIP
FRAMEWORK
There were large controversies surrounding the Bank's work in the Amazon in the 1980s, including the building of roads in
the northwest, and mining in Carajas. In response, the Bank withdrew from engagement on productive activities in the
Amazon, and concentrated its interventions on conservation, primarily through the use of trust funds and GEF grants. In
the intervening twenty years there have been massive changes in knowledge, perception and policy regarding the
Amazon. The "desafio paradigmatico" IS now how to reconcile conservation (vital for both biodiversity and cllmate
change) with development (how to meet the needs of the 23 million people who live in the Brazilian Amazon, how to use
the immense mineral and natural resources of the region in a susta~nablemanner, and how to build the energy
infrastructure and transport corr~dorsnecessary for the region's development.)
After an extensive consultation process, the Bank Group has developed an Amazon Partnership Framework, which has
been widely acknowledged as sound by the Federal and State governments, by NGOs, by the scientific community, by
the private sector and by bilateral partners. The Framework (described in detail in Annex 3) describes how the Bank
Group is becoming a full-service partner. This means supporting basic services for the people of the Amazon. It also
means working to increase the returns from agriculture in deforested areas, working to manage the large protected and
indigenous areas, and working to provide incentives (through sustainable forestry and payments for environmental
services) for preservation of forests that will not be protected. And it also means supporting the planning and
implementation of major energy and transport infrastructure which is central to the development of the region. This will
require the use of a wide variety of tools in a consistent manner. This means continuing to mobilize grant funds including those available from bilateral partners and the GEF, as in the past - and developing new funds such as those
being constructed to address issues of climate change. It will also entail conventional IBRD lending: to the States
(already to Para and Amapa, and in the first years of the CPS also to Amazonas and Acre); to the Federal Government
(the Ministry of Environment already, and potentially wlth the Ministries of Energy and Agriculture and the BNDES). And
finally ~t means IFC engagement with companies engaged in sustainable agriculture, infrastructure and forestry-in
particular through the proposed IFC Brazilian Amazon Initiative - BAI.

These examples illustrate how the Bank is preferentially engaging with the
27.
"desafios paradigmaticos" and with the higher-complexity areas where the global

knowledge and independence of the Bank are of greatest value to Brazil. Figure 6
provides an overview of areas where the Bank will do more, and Figure 7 an overview of
where the Bank will do less. (Annex 3 presents specific strategies which will guide Bank
engagement on particular elements of the pillars.)
The end result of this partnership is that the Bank aspires, at the end of the second
28.
administration, to contribute to a Brazil in which there is continued progress in
strengthening those areas where we were effective in the last CAS (the macro foundation,
and continuing progress in the equity and sustainability), and to redouble our efforts in
those areas where there was less progress (some aspects of public sector management,
competitiveness, overall growth and environmental sustainability).

B.

GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND SPEED

As Brazil's circumstances change, the Government - through the mechanism of
29.
COFIEX -- necessarily and appropriately reviews forms of Bank Group engagement,
taking into account long-term priorities, the comparative advantage of the Bank and the
areas where the Bank can add value. When vulnerability to external crises was a
concern, Finance Ministry officials wanted a Bank program which would consist
primarily of large Federal DPLs. A year later, with Brazil's foreign exchange reserves
adequate for the first time in decades (Figure 8), the Finance Ministry wants a small
Bank-financed Federal Program. The implication is that the Bank needs to be nimble and
flexible in responding to these changes in demand.
30.
This means that defining a detailed four-year lending program makes little sense.
In the just-ending CAS period only 53 percent (1 8 of 34) of projects defined for the first
two-year period materialized, a figure which dropped to 15 percent (4 of 26) in the
second two-year period. Accordingly, this CPS defines a potential lending program only
for the first two years and proposes criteria for selecting the areas for longer term
engagement.
31.
A related dimension is the need for flexibility vis-A-vis political cycles, a factor
which will become much more important as the bulk of Bank lending switches to the
state level. Governors and mayors are elected for four-year terms. It often takes them
several months to formulate their programs (which means that there is usually little
prospect for lending in the first year of their terms). They then want fast responses, with
programs signed and being put into place in the second and third years of their mandates,

for two reasons. They want to show voters that they are producing results, but also are
limited at the back end because Brazil's election laws prohibit the signing of loans in the
last nine months of the terms of elected officials. This means two things for the Bank first, that commitments are going to be uneven in CPS periods, with much more lending
in the first and second years of the CPS (which correspond to the second and third years
of political terms of state administrations) and less in the third and fourth years. And
second that the Bank and Government have to greatly shorten the very long (on average
30 months) lag between approval of the project concept by the Federal Government, and
signing of the loan.

MATCHING DEMAND AND SUPPLY THROUGH "PRINCIPLED
OPPORTUNISM"

The broad parameters of IBRD engagement are defined by the Ministries of
32.
Finance and Planning. It is they who define: the balance between federal and subnational lending; the priority to be given to the many demands for lending and technical
assistance by the 39 ministries of the Federal Government; the rules of the game for Bank
engagement with state and municipal governments. The operating idea of the IBRD and
IFC programs is now one of "principled opportunism". "Opportunism" inasmuch as it is
the Government and private sector which define the areas where Bank Group engagement
is requested; and "principled" in that both the IBRD and IFC bring views to the table of
where and how, within the universe of opportunities, they should (and should not)
engage.

33.
The broad parameters
years are as follows:

-

for now - of the IBRD lending program for the next two

Federal :
o The Federal Government has sufficient resources to finance most of its priorities.
And it is unlikely to need further infusions of rapid-disbursing, policy-based
loans. There is, however, a very strong demand from many ministries for
technical assistance from the Bank, especially on improving conceptual design of
their programs and in supporting program implementation and monitoring and
evaluation.
o To provide flexibility and to avoid the proliferation of small loans, these are likely
to be aggregated into programs for major areas (such as human development,
infrastructure and public sector management) and also where they promote greater
linkages between the federal and sub-national governments.
o Some allowance will be given for loans which are at an advanced stage of
preparation.
o The Federal Government may ask the Bank to provide support to the PAC.
States:
o Improvement in the fiscal capacity of States is one of the great achievements of
the FRL (Figure 9 shows how the fiscal condition of states has improved over the
last five years).
FIGURE
9: EVOLUTION
OF STATEGOVERNMENTS'

Abbr.

o The FRL provides a transparent, predictable framework for the states.
o The mechanism for Bank partnerships is as follows: States negotiate their Fiscal
Adjustment Programs, which define the limit of credit they can contract, with the
Secretary of the National Treasury (STN); Governors who wish to work with the
Bank discuss their priorities with the Bank Country Management Team; the Bank
responds by indicating those areas the Bank has expertise in, and how the Bank
might add value (see the principles for key areas in Annex 3); the Governor
submits proposed projects which fit within the assigned fiscal space to COFIEX
for consideration.
o This process works well for all - for the Governor (whose priorities are respected
and who gets a value-adding partnership with the Bank); for the Federal
Government (since this is done in compliance with the letter and spirit of the FRL
and respects the well-structured COFIEX process) and for the Bank (which gets
engaged with highly-motivated Governors on programs which are of high priority
and have political support).
o The Federal Ministries which manage large national programs (including Health,
Education, Energy, Environment, and Water Resources Management) see the
emerging state-level Bank-supported programs as an excellent opportunity for
drilling down their national programs, which the Bank has often played a role in
designing.
o Engagement with the Federal Government (which was mainly through the vehicle
of the Federal DPLs in the last CAS period) will remain intense, both on
operations with the Federal Government and because all "State operations" are, in
fact, operations between the States, the Federal Government and the Bank.
o The joint WB-IFC Sub-national Finance Initiative creates an opportunity for the
WBG to lend directly to sub-national entities without sovereign guarantees. The
Finance Ministry has taken the position that when there is lending to states and
municipalities there are implicit if not explicit guarantees. It has therefore, again
reasonably, stipulated that this facility can operate only with non-dependent
majority state- or municipality-owned utilities or entities, to enhance their access
to capital markets and commercial finance.

Municipalities:
o The Federal Government has specified that the Bank will only engage with
municipalities under special circumstances (typically where there are consortia of
municipalities dealing with major challenges, such as water and environment in
metropolitan Sao Paulo), when there are significant externalities (such as with the
port in the Baixada Santista) and when the project will generate revenues for the
municipality. In general the Government does not want the Bank lending to
municipalities when resources are available from domestic sources, such as from
the Ministry of Cities.
o In cities where we do engage, the focus will increasingly be on improving city
management, city competitiveness and on introducing results-oriented
mechanisms for providing urban services.
o Synergies will be sought between the IBRD lending and the IFC TA Facility to
improve the business environment at the municipal level

The Private Sector:
o The IFC in Latin America is leading a change process within the IFC. In Brazil,
access to finance has improved notably for Tier I companies. Capital markets
witnessed the expansion of the Novo Mercado, the launching of the Sustainability
index, and the beginning of mortgage securitization. Some Brazilian companies
became leading exporters, especially in agribusiness, as the economy became
more open to trade.
o In this process the traditional, demand-responsive, transactions-oriented focus is
being balanced by a stronger set of supply imperatives from IFC defined by a
strategic view that sees the IFC engaging more with second tier companies, more
through long-term relationships with specific clients and industries, and with a
focus on issues of corporate governance and sustainability (See Annex 5).
o In many ways the demand-supply negotiation is similar to the "principled
opportunism" practiced by the IBRD program.
o As this strategic process takes root, strong synergies between the IBRD (which
works on the enabling environment) and the IFC (which works with the private
sector), are emerging (Box 2).
B O X 2:

ONEWORLDBANKGROUPIN BRAZIL
- HOW THE IFC AND lBRD ARE WORKING TOGETHER

There is growing recognition in Brazil that effective development solutions involve actions by both the public and private
sectors. As the IBRD side of the business focuses increasingly on the "desafios paradigmaticos" for the public sector, so
the IFC increasingly focuses on areas where the private sector in Brazil needs to develop and change. There is a growing
demand from clients - public and private alike -for better integrated publiclprivate action on key themes.
Over the past two years the IFC and IBRD have started a process of exploring areas where they can work more
effectively together. Preparation for this has included several working meetings bringing together IBRD and IFC staff, with
the specific objective of identifying "low hanging fruit", where cooperation could give results in the short term.
There have been several areas in which substantial progress has been made.
Foremost among these is the Amazon, where the IFC and IBRD have developed (see Box 1) a joint partnership
framework. On the one hand the IBRD works with states in improving land titling and environmental management, while
the IFC works with major private firms to start a process of ensuring that agricultural and livestock activities respect
environmental and social laws. Third-party certification plays an increasing role in such activities.
A second emerging example is IFC engagement with the rural poverty programs financed by the Bank in the Northeast.
As the focus of these programs shifts from service provision to production, so the role of the private sector (as producer,
purchaser of products, and an intermediary) becomes vital and the partnership between the IBRD (with long experience in
working with 40,000 organized communities) and the IFC (which knows how to identify and develop supply chains)
becomes highly productive.
A third area of growing collaboration has been via the IFCllBRD Sub-national Facility (which, unlike normal IBRD lending
to States, does not require a sovereign guarantee). The Ministry of Finance has given a cautious autorization for the
Facility to explore support to independent public entities, such as state utility companies. IBRD and IFC staff are working
closely on developing a portfolio of activities with state water companies, with the idea that more of these emulate the best
(who are already listed on Wall Street). In doing this, priority is given to those states where the IBRD is supporting other
major programs, so that this becomes another element in overall support to reforming governors. All operations by the
Facility will have to be approved by the standing committee of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.
A fourth area is on business climate. The IFC has been active in dong business climate surveys in 13 states in Brazil.
Where the IBRD works with states and municipalities involved in this process, it seeks to translate the results of the IFC
surveys into practical changes.
Finally, it should be stressed that the growing IFCllBRD collaboration, too, builds on the idea of "principled opportunism".
The process has been successful because it is pragmatic, identifying a few low-hanging fruit, and showing that it is in the
interests of all - the \FC, the \BRDand, most importantly, our clients -that we work together where this makes sense.

o An ever-more confident Brazil also looks to the Bank Group as a key partner in
ensuring an inclusive and sustainable globalization, which includes IFC support
for taking more Brazilian companies global.
o Supporting the Private Sector Strategy, IFC's focus includes the following six
areas:
Increase access to finance and capital markets development: reach micro
entrepreneurs, small businesses, and second-tier companies and provide longterm financing for corporations through investments in medium-sized banks,
microfinance , and other vehicles designed to increase credit availability to
individuals (mortgages, consumer finance), and to middle market companies;
Support Tier I1 companies, particularly in general manufacturing and
agribusiness;
Strengthen infrastructure and logistics, including health and education by
increasing private sector participation, and local currency financing;
Improve the business enabling environment, helping small businesses join the
formal economy, and improving the country's competitiveness;
Promote sustainability through higher standards for corporate governance and
environmental and social performance;
Contribute to the sustainable development of the Amazon region;
Support Brazilian private sector aspiration to global leadership via financing
Brazilian companies investments in emerging markets, notably IDA countries,
promoting sustainability and meeting the global-climate change challenge.

Regional and Global:
o At the regional level, Brazil looks to the Bank to be a more active and effective
partner in the production of regional public goods. An example is potential Bank
support via a multi-country set of loans to help Brazil and its neighbors
implement a regional approach to dealing with foot and mouth disease, avian flu,
and, potentially, other challenges to animal and plant health. Equally-important is
Bank engagement with specific regional infrastructure investments of the South
America Regional Idrastructure Integration (IIRSA) program.
o The Bank has also started to support Brazil in "South-South partnership" - using
Brazil's cutting edge work in areas ranging from biofuels and agricultural
technology, to satellite imagery monitoring and prevention of deforestation, to
AIDS, conditional cash transfers and community-led development. Some
instruments - linking to the Consultative ~ r o u pon ~nternaiional Research
(CGIAR), Brazil's participation in consultative groups for African countries,
assistance in debt work outs, joint work by the Bank and Brazil in Haiti and other
countries of high Brazilian engagement - are some first steps in these efforts.
Discussion of specific modalities and instruments for strengthening such
cooperation are ongoing in the Bank in general and between the Bank and Brazil.
Coordination with WBI will be an important part of this effort.
o A partnership for improving the knviroknental and social quality of the
operations of BNDES also has potential to support regional efforts. Since
BNDES is a large actor both in the region and in Mica, this engagement could
become an important factor in promoting improved social and enviro-tal
performance of BNDES-financed projects outside of Brazil.

o The Bank will engage as an active partner with Brazil with climate change, trade
and other global challenges. In so doing, the Bank will help to ensure that
Brazil's perspectives and interests are represented, in ensuring that the line
between global goods and national ownership is not blurred, in ensuring that
development needs are given equal billing. In short, the Bank's perspective will
be to "level the playing field" on global challenges. The Bank will give high
priority to ensuring that it uses all of the available instruments (lending, AAA,
GEF, bilateral partnerships) in an integrated approach.
o Finally, a major element in Brazil "going global" is the ever-increasing
engagement of Brazilian companies abroad. This is a goal supported by the IFC's
focus on assisting Brazilian companies to enter overseas markets, notably in IDA
countries (e.g. CVRD in Mozambique, Odebrecht AIDS program in Angola).

Analytic and Advisory Work:
o Brazil values the Bank's analytic and advisory work. As Brazil changes, so too
does the nature of this work. First, in response to consistent demand from Brazil,
there will be greater emphasis on AAA work that addresses the "how" of policy
implementation, and less on the "what". Second, there will be greater integration
of AAA work with lending. Third, there will be greater participation by the
Ministries of Finance and Planning in definition of AAA priorities and in
disseminating results. Fourth, there will be greater emphasis on joint AAA with
IPEA, the Government's formidable economic research institute. Funds will also
be set aside to respond to "just in time" advice on highly sensitive, politicallycharged and strategic issues (for example, hydropower, civil aviation and highspeed trains, as well as strengthening debt management at the State level) where
the Government of Brazil values the combination of Bank knowledge and "seal of
approval". Programmatic AAA will help the Bank's AAA to be timely and
relevant, as well as to allow for effective use of our convening power. The Bank
will also engage in fee-for-service reimbursable TA in response to specific
Government requests (as is now being done for PPPs in Irrigation and Civil
Aviation).

D.

INSTRUMENTS

Brazil is one of the Bank's most sophisticated and demanding clients. The Bank
34.
program in Brazil has a long-standing reputation as a leader in innovation. The justending CAS period has confirmed this reputation. New low-cost, fast lending
instruments (such as additional financing and repeater projects) have been used to great
effect. There have also been innovations in lending instruments: in the development of
federal level SWAps for supporting Government programs in the health, road
maintenance and welfare areas; in the development of state-level SWAps and DPLs
which finance the Government's own programs and which pay for results; in an IFC
program which has developed the BOVESPA sustainability index, and engages with
agribusiness sustainability by using third-party certification, or develops the use of local
currency financing in infrastructure and housing finance.

More recently the Bank Group is applying new tools for the use of local currency.
35.
The IFC has issued its first bond in Reais in the Brazilian domestic capital markets, the
first ever foreign issuer in the Brazilian market. IFC also developed Reais lending
instruments which has thus far been used to finance the financial sector and for
infrastructure, but will be more widely used in other sectors. The IBRD is helping the
State of Rio de Janeiro in converting parts of its debt from dollars to Reais, and is
allowing borrowers to opt for currency conversion swaps to be performed by the Bank at
the time of each loan disbursement.
During this CPS the Bank, under the leadership of its Treasury Department, will
36.
re-double its efforts to develop and apply financial instruments which respond to Brazil's
evolving needs. At the federal level this will include offering traditional IBRD lending,
guarantees, and IBRD intermediation for long dated risk management tools. At the subnational level, where there is rapidly-growing interest in using the embedded flexibility
of IBRD loans at a project and portfolio level, the Bank will offer: more flexible
repayment terms to better manage the rollover risk of their overall debt portfolio;
conversion of existing loans to, and or obtaining new loans with automatic conversion
into, Brazilian Reais to reduce their exchange rate volatility; offer other IBRD banking
products and guarantees to maximize the developmental impact of specific programs, to
achieve the desired costlrisk structure of existing projects and to structure appropriate
financing for new projects. The Sub-national Finance Initiative allows lending directly to
sub-national entities without sovereign guarantees. Finally, both at the federal and subnational level they could use the guarantee products for credit enhancement to catalyze
private sector investment or to help develop the state and municipality bond market.
37.
In the upcoming CPS period it is anticipated that the Brazil program will continue
to lead and innovate in the area of the use of country systems. This will include
supplementing the now-standard use of Brazil's financial system (SIAFI), with larger
procurement thresholds, and work with selected states on strengthening their capacity for
environmental and social management, including progressive alignment of Bank and
national safeguard systems. In many states such as Ceara, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco and
Rio Grande do Sul, the Bank has undertaken Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessments as well as OECD benchmarking exercises in procurement in
order to raise the level of performance in these areas. (See Annex 7 on country systems.)
Brazil has carefully considered the issue of unbundling the Bank's knowledge and
38.
lending services. It has experimented with the fee-for-service mechanism, and sees this
as a useful tool for some specific, limited cases. Overall the Federal Government has
decided that it likes the "bundled model", with more range and flexibility in the technical
services components.
VI.

RELATIONS WITH OTHER EXTERNAL FINANCING AGENCIES IN
BRAZIL

The major external financing agencies operating in Brazil are the Inter-American
39.
Development Bank (IADB), Andean Development Corporation (CAF) and the World

Bank. The IADB and CAF both work to contribute to the process of economic and social
development in Latin America and actively carry out projects in Brazil. CAF has
concentrated its efforts on: i) supporting municipal governments; ii) regional integration;
iii) socio-economic development; iv) infrastructure; and v) the private sector. The IADB
is currently initiating its strategy for engagement in Brazil. On a preliminary basis the
future strategy will build on the existing one with an emphasis on municipalities. Its
operational strategy for the period between 2004-2007 rests on three major components,
including: i) promoting sustained, stable and environmentally sustainable growth; ii)
reducing poverty, promoting social inclusion, and enhancing social and regional equity;
and iii) supporting institutional strengthening and promoting democracy and citizen
participation. In this sense, in accordance with the 2003 Multi-year Plan (PPA), their
priorities emphasized productivity and infrastructure; poverty, equity, and workforce
development; living conditions and efficiency in cities; and institutional strengthening
and modernization of the government.
40.
As is appropriate in a sophisticated MIC, it is the Government that decides which
agency will do what. In this sense, the Bank program does take into account what others
do. With the IADB there is an informal structure. There are:
Areas where the two banks can work together effectively (for example, in financing
the Bolsa Familia program and, in the future, in helping with restructuring state
debts);
Areas where the banks "leave it to the other" (with the IBRD specializing, for
example, in rural development and the IDB in tourism); and
Areas where demand is so large that both banks engage independently (in areas such
as public sector management and infrastructure).
The Bank also works closely with several bilateral agencies - for example, the EU
41.
and Germany in conservation in the Amazon, and the UK on climate change and public
sector management.

VII.

IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES

There are a series of challenges that need to be met if the Bank Group is to be the
42.
best partner it can be to Brazil. Over the previous CAS period there was a concerted and
successful effort to address a major disbursement challenge (with, for example, the
disbursement ratio increasing from 17 percent to 40 percent. Nevertheless, Bank
programs in Brazil are among the poorest in terms of false starts, and times between idea
and action. As shown in Figure 11, on average it takes 30 months from initiation
(approval at COFIEX) to signing of a loan (with the average being even longer for subnational loans). The institutional fragility of many sub-national entities, and the
processes required for confirming financial and legal capacity play an important role.
All realize that this means poor performance, not least because governors cannot commit
to programs that materialize only after they have left office! The Bank and IDB have
formed a working group with the Ministries of Finance and Planning, with the aim being
to develop procedures whereby the processing time can be reduced by at least a half, by
(responsibly) advancing some processes, by shortening others, and by working in parallel

where possible and where this is in accordance with approved Bank procedures. Recent
experience shows that better communication between the Federal Government, the States
and the Bank is reducing delays, as is the practice of ensuring that projects are initiated
only if there is demonstrated high-level political support.
It also means understanding that development effectiveness (of, say, a state
43.
project) is a product of the abstract quality of the project, and the commitment of the
Governor to the project. If it takes 30 months to prepare a "perfect project" (with every
"i" crossed and "t" dotted), the Governor's commitment will be very low, as will
development effectiveness. If it takes 12 months to produce a "pretty good project,"
(which complies with all Government and Bank policies, but in which some details are
left to implementation) the Governor's commitment will be very high, as will
development effectiveness. The Bank is committed to reducing the time it takes to
prepare projects. Regional management is committed to giving a clear signal that the
best should not become the enemy of the good.

VIII. THE LENDING PROGRAM FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS
Over the past year there have been extensive (and very productive) discussions
44.
with the Ministries of Finance and Planning, and multiple consultations with line
ministries, state and local governments, the private sector and civil society about the
Bank Group program for the next four years (See Annex 6 on the Consultation Process).
In the sensitive case of the Amazon, as described in Box 1, the Bank Group has discussed
multiple drafts of an Amazon Partnership Framework with the Ministry of Environment

and Foreign Affairs, other ministries, states, NGOs in Brazil, international NGOs and
bilateral partners in Europe, and the private sector.
An indicative lending program for the next two years is summarized in Table 3
45.
and described more in detail at Annex B3.
TABLE3: CURRENT
ESTIMATE
OF IBRD LENDING
PROGRAM
FOR FYO8-09

As can be seen, while the portfolio includes a number of projects that are at an
46.
advanced stage of preparation and were defined under the old "rules of the game", there
are sharp shifts in several respects from the program of the previous CAS:
There is a pronounced move away from rapid-disbursing DPLs.
The Federal program is much smaller, and largely comprises Technical Assistance
Loans, some SWAps and programs that promote synergies across federal and state
lending (for example, education and water resource management).
There is a marked shift in the focus of the program toward the States. However, all
lending to the States will go forward only with a sovereign guarantee and within the
overall borrowing limits of the program as set out below.
The already appraised "carry over" municipal loans have been bundled into
horizontal APLs and any new municipal lending would be for larger, more strategic
projects and respond to more rigorous selection criteria.
The State programs are far larger and correspond much more directly to the priorities
of the governors (rather than only reflecting continuity with traditional sectoral
constituencies).
The program is closely aligned with the big development challenges, the "desafios
paradigmaticos".
The program uses a wide variety of instruments - TALs, SWAPS, APLs, DPLs, SILs,
additional financing, repeater projects - depending on the particular type of project
and the needs and capabilities of the borrower.
Simulations suggest that this level and structure of lending would leave Brazil
47.
adequate headroom below IBRD's current single borrower exposure limit of $14.5
billion. This will be monitored continuously as the lending pipeline develops.
The IFC, which operates on a much shorter cycle, has clear rules of engagement,
48.
but does not and should not have a pre-defined lending program. Overall, the

Corporation expects to commit annual amounts in the $400-$600 million range, further
leveraged by its syndication program with commercial banks.
49.
The Country Financing Parameters (CFP) approved on May 21, 2004 will be
slightly adjusted, as described in Annex 8. Under the previous CAS, the CFP allowed
cost sharing to go as high as 100 percent and anticipated that Bank's financing share in
individual projects be differentiated by government level, region and sector. In order to
avoid perceptions of inequality and/or setting perverse incentives, the Federal
Government requested an agreement on a consistent policy on cost-sharing for States.
Since then, this has become a non-issue. For all investment lending using the traditional
project support approach, the Bank has allowed 100 percent co-financing, while for all
investment lending using the SWAP approach, cost sharing has been a relatively small
proportion of the programs it supports, typically fiom about 10 percent in the large Bolsa
Familia program, to up to 35 percent of the relevant eligible programs in the upcoming
Minas Gerais SWAp. As the Bank's program envisages greater use of SWAps; the
Bank's financing share is expected to be significantly lower than the 100 percent limit.
50.
Under the previous CAS, the CFP included a provision that "recurrent cost
financing would be temporary and based on specific criteriat'. This provision responded
to the needs of a portfolio which included a good number of development policy loans to
deal with cases of temporary fiscal distress in the context of good fiscal and budget
management. The environment in Brazil and the instruments for Bank engagement have
changed. Multi-sector programmatic operations using the SWAP mechanism are
emerging as a major instrument in our partnership with Brazil. Under the SWAP
mechanism, Bank loans finance portions of eligible expenditure programs that may
include recurrent costs, and in some cases include salaries, while closely monitoring such
programs. While such an approach requires continued strong expenditure management
and evidence of sustainability, it does not require that the circumstances under which the
funding occurs be one of "temporary fiscal distress" as defined in the previous Country
Financing Parameters.

IX.

RESULTS

51.
The last CAS had an elaborate results matrix, describing high-order goals to
which the program would contribute, and committing to joint monitoring of these goals.
This has proved to be unrealistic. As a small player in a very large economy, the Bank
has little influence on the achievements of broad social and economic objectives. No
joint monitoring took place.
52.
In this sense, the focus on results, at a realistic and practical level, has been a
major feature of the last CAS, and a hugely successful feature of the Bank's evolving
program. This has meant - for example in the Cearh and Minas Gerais cases, and in the
engagement with the Ministry of Health - major institutional changes so that agencies
aad individuals have incentives to produce results. The dramatic improvement in results
has been widely reported and has meant that many other states and agencies are now also
moving towards results-oriented programs. In short, the results in the Bank-financed

programs are important both directly (in producing better quality services, for example)
and indirectly, in that the success of the results focus has meant that the approaches are
being followed in many other settings. While the Bank has no pretensions to being
engaged in monitoring results in all sectors, in some cases - such as Bolsa Farnilia and
the road sector - Bank engagement is very deep and monitoring results of Bank-financed
interventions coincides with overall monitoring of Government results.

53. This CPS will reinforce and deepen this "results orientation" both through
projects and through a simplified results matrix. All Bank interventions include specific
and realistic descriptions of the expected results, and a large and growing proportion of
Bank activities in Brazil is specifically designed to strengthen a focus by the relevant
entity on results, the measurement and evaluation of these, and the adjustment of
institutional arrangements and incentives to produce better results. This approach is
highly valued, and is at a level at which contribution is reasonable.
54.
Annex 1 presents a more simplified results matrix than that prepared for the
previous CAS. The focus is on identifying a few indicators that align with the
Government's objectives, but that are closer to our direct interventions and can give us a
good indication if the CPS is making progress in the four key pillars of the program.

X.

RISKS

55.
As one of the Bank's most important MIC clients, Brazil presents substantial
opportunities, but these opportunities are not without risk.
56.
Domestically, there are three principal risks to the proposed strategy. The first is
that the Bank's engagement with the Federal Government might weaken as a result of the
sharp move to a State focus and that institutional and implementation capacity may be
weaker leveling some states. This risk will be mitigated by ensuring that the new state
projects are conceived of, by all parties, as projects that fully engage three parties - the
State, the Bank and the Federal Government. Initial experience shows that, if anything,
dialogue with the Federal Government has become more intense. Detailed engagement
through non-lending technical assistance and TA will help to strengthen subnational
institutional capacity.
The second risk is that the political economy of reform is such that it is possible
57.
that little progress will be made in addressing the difficult structural issues that are
impeding growth, such as tax reform, social security reform and labor reform. The recent
upturn in growth, reaching investment grade status and impending municipal elections in
2008, suggest that obtaining the constituencies for pushing the needed reforms may be
difficult. Here the Bank has no option but to put the "principled" part of "principled
opportunism" to work, and to make sure that we are alert to, and engage, whenever
opportunities for addressing these politically-difficult structural issues arise. Experience
to date has shown that doing this in a quiet, supportive-of-reformers mode can be
effective.

The third risk on the domestic front, related to the first, is that the desired public
58.
investment that underpins the Government program will not materialize, either because of
lack of fiscal space, or because of the difficulty in implementing the investment projects
effectively. Here the Bank has been asked to engage - and is engaging - vigorously in
improving the quality of public spending, and in helping address some of the deep-seated
challenges arising from the effective dismantling of investment and project planning in
Brazil. In terms of fiscal space, the Government of Brazil is well aware that the healthy
state of the economy is in a context of overall global stability and booming commodity
markets. The Government strictly adheres to its own fiscal surplus target, and has
managed its reserves effectively to provide an unprecedented cushion against external
shocks.

59.
External risks are not a major threat at this point; however, any sudden reduction
in financing, or transmission of the effects of volatility from an international financial
crisis could affect the economy through an impact on interest rates and inflation. If the
current nominal appreciation of the Real continues unabated, the negative affects on
competition could begin to outweigh the positive effects of the cheaper cost of importing
capital and machinery.
60.
These domestic and external risks are mitigated by the fact that the current
policies of fiscal management, inflation targeting and the floating exchange rate are well
managed and well entrenched, providing a solid anchor to the economy.
Finally, the risk to the Bank of not pursuing a new and more flexible approach in
one of our major MIC clients is that of irrelevance. There are a number of non-traditional
opportunities arising in Brazil and the risk of not-being competitive is real. The
flexibility and approach of the proposed CPS strategy aims to help the Bank address this
risk.

ANNEX2 : POVERTY
REDUCTION,
RECENTECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS,
AND
EXTERNAL
SUSTAINABILITY
Brazil has come a very long way in four years. At the outset of the FY04-07 CAS the
incoming Government of President Lula da Silva faced high expectations and great uncertainty.
Elected on a platform of social change, the Government promised to make a dent in Brazil's
poverty and inequality, among the world's highest. The new administration also was confronted
with external vulnerability and a crisis of confidence in international markets. Considerable
progress has been made:
macroeconomic management has been exemplary, external
vulnerability has been substantially reduced, exports and reserves are at their highest historic
levels and inflation and country risk at their lowest. Meanwhile, economic stability combined
with targeted programs and policies have brought income-based poverty and inequality to
historically low levels. Most Brazilians, especially the poorest, are better off than they were four
years ago. Moreover, in a changing global context, Brazil is increasingly stepping into a
leadership role in areas such as clean fuels, trade, social policy (conditional cash transfers) and
HIVIAIDS prevention.
A. Brazil has achieved significant reductions in poverty and inequality
Poverty reduction and income distribution indicators have dramatically improved. During
the early 1990s, the full poverty rate was about 41 percent. It dropped sharply to about 33-34
percent in 1995 and then persisted at about this rate until 2003, when a steady decline of about 3
percent a year started.' In 2006 the full poverty rate fell to 25.6 percent. In 2006 alone, it is
estimated that some 6 million Brazilians moved out of poverty. Extreme poverty rates followed
a similar path, falling from 14.5 percent in 2003 to 9.1 percent in 2006. Using the Bank's global
definition of "less than $1 a day", the poverty headcount ratio dropped steadily from 14 percent
of the population to 8 percent from 1990 to 2004, and is now for the first time in single-digit
figures. Beginning in 2001, the income inequality (Gini) index also began a historic fall, coming
down from 0.60 in 2002 to 0.54 in 2006. Fueling this substantial improvement has been low
inflation and economic growth, targeted transfer programs (including "Bolsa Familia," a
conditional cash transfer program), improvements in labor productivity due to gains in schooling,
and a reduction in the geographic segmentation of labor markets.* This does not imply the
luxury of complacency on the equity agenda: Brazil's inequality remains among the highest in
the world, and millions of people still live in poverty.
Access to social services has expanded. Both the total youth literacy rate and the total primary
completion rates have improved. The youth literacy rate improved from 92 percent to 97 percent
during 1990-2006 and the total primary completion rates increased to 108.9 percent in 2004 from
89.8 percent in 1995. Child mortality, improving maternal health, and combating HIVIAIDS,
malaria, and other diseases all steadily improved. Immunization rates improved and child
mortality rates (per 1000 live births) decreased from 53.7 in 1990 to 28.7 infants in 2005. The

Access to infrastructure services has also expanded, although there remain large
differences amang states. On average the number of Brazilian household^ with access to
electricity increased from 88.8 percent to 98 percent in 2005 and the variation among states fell,
Awess tio saniation has made progress with 50,3 percent of households having access, up from

macroeconomic performance has exceeded expectations.

Fis-1 polliey hlls been tightly managed. As seen in Figure 2a, over the past decade the primary
smgdw
&adily increased. It reached 4.4 percent of GDP in 2005 and fell slightly to 4.0
percent of GDP in 2007. However, this fiscal stance has been obtained through high levels a f
taxdon and with high levels of spending. Nevertheless, the careful fiscal stance in recent years
has contributed to a fall in public debt and an improvement in its composition. Public debt
declined from over 52.4 percent of GDP in 2003 to below 42.8 percent of GDP by end 2007.
The compositisn of public debt has improved through reduced exposure to exchange rate risk
and a pocess of de-linking debt from short-term interest rates. In particular, prepayment of debt
with %lyeIMP, Paris Club creditors, and Brady bdnds in late 2005 and early 2006 contributed
significantly to the improved external debt composition.

The Government shows continued commitment to its inflation-targeting regime. Inflation
fell steadily fram 12.5 percent in 2002 to 5.7 percent in 2005 and just over 3 percent izl 2006
(T;igm2b). T.nfl~tianin 2007 ws 4.5 percent just at the mid-point of the central bank target.
Appreciatian of the Real has contributed to containing inflation. Consistent with the illnation
targeting reghe, the Central Bank began to cut the headline interest rate from a peak of about
19.75 percent in mid-2005 to 11.25 percent in end-December 2007. This implies that real
*lf h p to 7-8 percent. In the Brazilian context, this represents a m w t i d
pwitiue change; however, interest rates remain high by international comparison.
Strong externd seator performance has reduced external vulnerability. Exports almost
doubled fram 2003 to 2007, with leading products being minerals and petroleum raw matmials,

Annex page 6

as well as sugar (raw and processed). The external current account surplus remained positive
from 2003 to 2007 and was 0.3 percent of GDP in 2007. This supported an appreciation of the
nominal exchange rate from just below R$4 to the US dollar in October 2002 to around R$1.70
in December 2007. The trade surplus persisted in the first half of 2007, despite the relatively
strong Real, in part due to resilient international commodity prices. Net international reserves
have grown to US$190 billion (18 months of imports). IMF calculations suggest that after a
decade in which increasing reserves were critical, the Brazilians have now achieved a level of
reserves that is above the optimum (See Figure 2e). Prospects for further reserve accumulation
remain strong and could reach US$200 billion by end 2008 (1 6 months of imports).
At the federal level, Brazil recently reached "investment grade" in capital markets.
Sovereign spreads fell from 2,400 basis points in October 2002 to a historically low level of
around 141 basis points in May 2007, reflecting the improved resilience of the Brazilian
economy to external shocks. Rating agencies recently upgraded Brazilian sovereign debt to
investment grade. Besides the low quality of the fiscal adjustment, the level of public debt and
its high costs still represent a persistent source of risk. However, most sub-national government
generally would have a long way to go before achieving investment grade.
Despite this positive macro performance, growth has not met the Government's targets. At
2.9 percent and 3.7 percent in 2005 and 2006 respectively, growth was well short of Government
targets, which ranged from 4.5 to 5 percent (see Figure 20. Growth for 2007 growth was a more
robust 5.4 percent. While positive real economic growth was achieved throughout the CAS
period, average growth was low compared with other parts of the world and even other countries
in the region.

C. External debt sustainability indicators are very strong
Strong external performance has reduced external vulnerability: Brazil's external debt
sustainability indicators are now the strongest in 35 years. Strong exports reduced the debt
service to export ratio from 1.27 in 1999 (its highest historical value) to 0.32 in 2007. Strong
reduction of gross external debt and export growth led to a significant reduction of net external
debt from US$190 billion in 1999 to US$4 billion in 2007. The reduction of net external debt
reinforced the positive effect of the exports growth promoting a dramatic fall of the net debt to
exports ratio from the highest level of 3.6 in 1999 to 0 in 2007. Similar patterns are observed
regarding gross debt to GDP and net debt to GDP.

Reserve accumulation also contributed to reduced external vulnerability. International reserves
represented 6.8 months of GNFS imports in 1999, while in 2007, international reserves represent
14 months of GNFS imports. The ratio of international reserves to short term debt also increased
from 57 percent in 1999 to 283 percent in 2007 indicating a strong resilience to external shocks.
The general reduction of external indebtedness has not affected the Bank portfolio. Excluding the
prepayment of its entire outstanding obligations to the IMF in December 2005, debt with
multilaterals has been increasing- since 1999 and the Bank's share of multilateral debt
outstanding been consistently above 40 percent.

ANNEX3: CPS PROGRAM
AND SECTOR
STRATEGIES
As in the previous CAS the programs for the CPS are oriented around the four key pillars of the
strategy: i) macro fundamentals, good governance and public sector management as a foundation
that contributes to ii) an equitable Brazil; iii) a sustainable Brazil and iv) a more competitive
Brazil. The Private Sector Strategy will also be highlighted as an integral part of the World Bank
Group sector strategies, as each of the pillars are supporting and leveraging private sector
resources. This annex outlines how the World Bank Group's key programs and interventions
contribute to the pillars and the results as set out in Annex 1.

I.

Poverty Reduction and Economic Management

Supporting Growth, Good Governance and Public Sector Management
Under the previous CAS, support to this pillar was carried out through both the Fiscal
Reform and Social Security Programmatic DPL series. In pensions, procurement and state
public sector reform, the Bank's impact was high. However, in public sector management more
broadly at the Federal level the Bank's impact was relatively limited. Significant progress was
made in consolidating fiscal and macroeconomic stability, although growth remained relatively
weak.
Challenges Facing Brazil in Poverty Reduction and Economic Management

1) Although fiscal balances are currently in good shape, there are a variety of threats to
fiscal sustainability. Success in fiscal stabilization has been achieved through increasing taxes
as opposed to improving expenditure efficiency. Brazil's current tax burden is very high at 34
percent of GDP in 2006. The high tax burden poses strong disincentives to private investment,
formal sector employment, and economic growth. Not only are tax rates high, but the structure
of taxation is extremely complex with various levels of direct and indirect taxation. The system
is further complicated by extensive systems of fiscal incentives that induce "fiscal wars" among
regions, reduce transparency and make the system as a whole more regressive.
High deficits and spending on Social Security also pose a risk to fiscal sustainability. Brazil
spends more than 11.3 percent of GDP on pensions and social assistance benefits for the elderly,
which represents a disproportionately large expenditure for a demographically young and middle
income country. Most countries with similar demographic profiles and levels of income spend
about 5 percent of GDP on pensions and other programs designed to protect the elderly,
survivors, and the disabled.
The challenge faced by Brazilian policy-makers is to design and implement a social
protection reform agenda that preserves the gains in coverage and poverty reduction that
have been achieved, while simultaneously opening more space for other social and
investment programs that promote growth and increase incomes for all segments of
society.3

Annex page 10

A combination of circumstances creates weaknesses in public sector management and
especially public expenditure management. With general public expenditures over 40 percent
of GDP, Brazil has the largest public sector among middle income countries. Spending
mandated through the Constitution and other legal means has increased rapidly, and without
some change may become explosive4. Currently eighty percent of spending in the budget is
earmarked, leaving only 20 percent for discretionary spending. Revenues are also earmarked
leading to high levels of budget rigidity. Over time the composition of public spending has
shifted to larger shares of government consumption, social security and away from public
investment and targeted capital subsidies. There are also significant weaknesses in planning,
budgeting, execution and evaluation processes in the budget that affect all of the sectors.
In the previous CAS, efforts to address the fiscal space and public sector management
issues were largely tackled through the Fiscal and Social Security Reform DPL series. A
number of smaller TA operations accompanied these DPLs to help on the implementation side,
including the Fiscal and Financial Responsibility TAL, the State Pension Reform Loans I and I1
and the Municipal Pension Reform Loan. While these latter operations are loans negotiated with
the Federal Government, they are umbrella operations targeted at improving pension
administration at the state and municipal level. Under the CPS period supervision of these
projects will be on-going.
Moving forward, there are three core elements to the World Bank Group's strategy for
addressing fiscal and public sector management issues: i) improving the effectiveness of the
state, ii) reducing the 'Custo Brasil' (high costs of doing business) and iii) strengthening
accountability with a focus on results. At the federal level, the Bank will focus on key issues
such as improving the quality of expenditures, monitoring and evaluation, and improving country
systems in financial management, procurement and safeguards. At the state level, the Bank is
developing programs based on a cross-cutting results-based management (where demanded by
the states) and in key sectors. In line with the positive experiences in Ceara and Minas Gerais
during the previous CAS period, the focus is on results orientation. At the municipal level,
namely in Sgo Paulo and in the Northeast region, both IFC and FIAS are providing their advisory
services on business simplification.
The Bank Group program in the coming year's will address the most complex challenges in
fiscal and public sector management through using both AAA and lending instruments. On
Tax Reform, the team is preparing an analytical piece on Fiscal Federalism (FY08) that draws
out the linkages between tax reform, the transfer system, and sub-national borrowing. In order
for tax reform to be viable, the interlinked issues of intergovernmental finance needs to be
addressed.
On Social Security the FY07 study "Brazil: Towards a Sustainable and Fair Pension
System" has been drawn upon extensively by the Government in the Forum on Social
Security that is currently underway. In addition the Bank is providing "just in time" support
on this topic to key policy makers. Over the next year, the team working on Social Security
issues will aim to analyze these issues in selected states given that a number of states have
particularly large pension systems that are contributing to fiscal imbalances. In addition the team
will continue to supervise the State Pension Rehabilitation I1 Loan and the Municipal Pensions
\oan in order to help states and municipalities improve the administration of these systems.

See World Bank. 2007. Brazil: Improving Fiscal Circumstances for Growth. Report No. 36595-BR.

Annex page 1 1

The team will also address some basic fiscal space and macroeconomic risk issues through
the Risk Assessment Study (FYOS) and in further pieces of AAA to lay out key options for
the Government concerning macro policy.
Improving public sector management is a key challenge and there are a variety of
instruments and operations lined up to help on this front. The Good Governance
Programmatic AAA (FY08,09) will support "drilling down" on governance issues in the sectors,
and Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments in the States, as well
as work on auditing and procurement will help support improved systems. It will also support
the Quality of Education Expenditure work, as well as assistance with budget and oversight
institutions. Finally, it will aim once again to bring together State level officials for a conference
on Public Management in June (in partnership with CONSAD, the confederation of Secretariats
of Administration of the States). The BRAVA program will continue to support the
development of Monitoring and Evaluation Efforts institutions in Brazil. Finally, in -depth
analysis of the key public sector management issues in the sectors and in central Ministries and
how to improve state management and performance will be the subject of a traditional ESW
entitled Strengthening the Efectiveness of the State (FY09). All of this AAA plays a key role in
supporting our lending operations and in sharing advanced knowledge with our Brazilian
partners.
A variety of lending operations will support our efforts to improve public sector
management. At the Federal level the Bank is working to define with the Government a Good
Governance TAL (FY09) in order to strengthen central government planning, budgeting and
implementation processes both in the line ministries and in sectoral ministries.
At the State level, the program will continue to support results-based-management
programs that address core public sector issues and key public management issues in the
sectors. Cexa SWAP I1 (FYOS), GDF Public Sector Management (FY09), Minas Gerais
Development Partnership I1 (FY08). In Rio Grande do Sul (FY08) the Bank team is working to
resolve a difficult debt situation in the framework of the all-important FRL, to support important
changes to the social security system and to assist in public sector reform. Work in these states
has led to increasing demand from other states for assistance in the future. In many states the
principal interest in working with the Bank is to tap into the technical skills and in-depth
knowledge that Bank teams offer.

Strengthened Competitiveness
As noted in the CAS completion report the overall results on competitiveness in Brazil have
been disappointing. Nonetheless, there have been some achievements in access to fmance,
capital markets development, and the opening of the economy to international trade, as described
in Annex 5 (Private Sector Strategy Annex). Support under the previous CAS focused primarily
on AAA and TA. One DPL, the Second Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable
Growth also supports this agenda.

Work on private sector development -- competitiveness and the investment climate issues -is an important component of accelerating growth in Brazil. In his first term, President Lula
embraced an ambitious set of microeconomic and institutional reforms aimed at increasing
financial eff~ciency,reducing the cost of doing business, decreasing logistics costs, and fostering
Annex page 12

innovation. Legislative initiatives were not isolated but were rather part of a larger set of policy
measures that consolidated reforms in each corresponding field.
Despite this progress, activity by the private sector remains stifled by various barriers and
regulations that prevent Brazil from achieving its growth potential. Brazil needs further
initiatives to improve its investment climate, such as those targeted to reduce the time needed to
open a business and expediting customs clearance services and Brazil ranks poorly in many
surveys of business climate. There is significant administrative bureaucracy and business
regulation is complex and somewhat unpredictable, with weak and judiciary institutions and
contract enforcement. Labor markets remain rigid. High rates of crime in urban areas take a toll
on private sector investment and confidence.' The key challenge for the Government to enhance
private sector development is to pursue complementary and consistent microeconomic reforms
across a wide range of policy domains, with sufficient critical mass to have a significant impact
on growth.
The Bank Group private sector strategy in the coming years will continue to address the
main challenges especially as related to competitiveness and the investment climate.
Brazil's sluggish growth performance is, in part, related with an investment climate that does not
favor private sector development. Microeconomic factors that reduce private sector investment
and productivity growth include: poorly performing financial markets; high regulatory risks for
private investment in infrastructure; significant logistics costs; and, low-effective technological
policies.
O n technology and innovation, the FY07 study Knowledge and Innovation for
Competitiveness, will be used as the basis for the dialogue with the different levels of
government. The conceptual and analytical methodological model of the national level report
will be applied to selected Brazilian States. This is a natural continuation of previous work as
using the report's methodology at state level gives the opportunity to "drill-down" into the
specific challenges faced by Brazilian States, which differ significantly among themselves, in
their efforts to promote faster economic growth.
In order to support the analytical and operational work and the policy dialogue at both the
federal and sub national levels, an Investment Climate Survey (ICS) will be conducted in
FY08 and the Assessment delivered in FY09. The last ICS was carried out in 2003 and many
changes have taken place in the country since then. With all its limitations, this kind of survey is
important to assess productivity (and thus long run growth) determinants. Moreover, the sample
is being designed in such a way to permit an in-depth comparison of investment climate at the
sub national level, using firm-level data.
In terms of operations, the World Bank Group will be supporting progress in the private
sector development agenda also at the sub national level. The governors elected in 2006 have
been asking for Bank Group support in several areas, including policies to foster economic
growth. Projects under preparation for large Brazilian states as Minas Gerais and Ceara will
include a PSD component. States in Brazil have an important role in several areas of private
sector development, such as logistics, business environment and innovation policies.

Compared to five years ago, the financial system has made progress in the Tier I segment
of the market (Tier I banks, and access to finance for Tier I companies). With respect to
capital markets, important developments have included the Novo Mercado, the Sustainability
Index, securitization in housing finance (See Annex 5).

However, while Brazil has the largest financial system in the region, with more than $600 billion
in assets, the ratio of bank lending to GDP is low relative to other countries (25 of GDP
compared to 70 percent in Chile, and 135 percent in Spain, for example. A significant portion of
financial activities are dedicated to financing the public sector through bonds. In addition to
being relatively scarce, credit is also very expensive, especially for individuals and small
enterprises. The overall efficiency of the Brazilian banking system is in line with its peers, but
actual costs are much higher as higher bank costs are being compensated by higher revenues,
mainly due to elevated nominal interest rates. Capital markets are still very small and insurance
needs deregulation if it is to continue growing. Government policies and the institutional
framework also hamper efficiency and affect competition in the financial sector. Transactions
taxes add to operational costs and increase barriers to entry, high reserve requirements facilitate
liquidity at the expense of efficiency, and directed lending schemes and public institutions add to
distortions of competition. Regulatory burdens and judicial uncertainties also add to the cost of
operation and impinge on proper risk management practices. Contract enforcement and legal
claims are perceived as non-bonding, and the lack of adequate credit information promotes the
perception of high risk. Ultimately, while Brazil has a dynamic and growing financial sector, the
challenge is to promote initiatives that will support even greater competitiveness, efficiency and
effective risk management, while maintaining ~tability.~
In the financial sector, a two-pronged strategy is proposed to provide support to the
Brazilian Government in a selective, relevant and timely manner, together with IFC's four
areas of focus in support of the private sector. In the first prong, the team will support
financial sector initiatives to promote sector competitiveness, efficiency and risk management,
while maintaining stability. These initiatives aim at improving the functioning of the system
itself, and would concentrate on banking in FY07-08 given its weight and the links with other
sub-sectors within the financial system (although keeping current work in capital markets). In
FY09, the focus will progressively move towards other areas, such as capital markets and
insurance. Activities include:

Programmatic economic sector work: (i) Complete studies on directed lending and quasi
taxes to promote efficiency (FY07-08) and; prepare studies on capital markets and
insurance to be launched next fiscal year (FY08-09);
Facilitate activities of the on-going Growth Loan DPL and TAL related to the financial
sector particularly competition rules, risk management (positive information sharing),
and insurance; and
Continue the supervision of the Financial Sector TAL with the Securities and Exchanges
Regulator (CVM), fostering improved regulation and supervision, increased transparency
and enhanced minority shareholder protection. This will reinforce and help
institutionalize progress made through the Novo Mercado and the Sustainability Index
JC will continue to support.

ti

See World Bank. 2007. The Structure of Banking Services Report.

Annex page 14

IFC's support to the first prong will be through financing of Brazil's increasing dynamic
securitization-oriented firms, and/or securitization transactions/facilities, as well as wholesaleoriented credit programs managed by banks. Furthermore, support to Tier I1 banks will also
deepen the impact of work done with the Brazilian Government.
A second prong in the strategy for the financial sector is to support sector-specific
programs where the financial sector acts as a catalyst or facilitator of development in other
areas of the economy. The role of the Financial Sector Brazil team in these initiatives would
be to support teams working in other sectors by evaluating the financial institutions included and
the systemic impact of the operation, as well as by facilitating the definition of the specific
mechanism involved. Such work will be performed through cross-support to teams working in
sector specific issues, as well as Financial Sector led-initiatives to facilitate their development.
Cross-fertilization between IBRD and IFC will maximize the Bank Group impact, notably in the
area of housing finance, and access to finance for the lower income groups (SMEs, microfinance,
and lower income individuals). IFC's case-by-case transactions focusing on sustainability
related initiatives (e.g. in support of the Brazilian Amazon), or capital markets-oriented
transactions will feed directly into IBRD work.

11.

Human Development

Broadening Our Focus: Human Development and the Growth and Equity Agendas
In the last CAS, the World Bank Group's strategy focused on the contribution of the
Human Development Sectors (education, health, social protection) to the equity pillar, with
an emphasis on investing in people to reduce extreme poverty and social exclusion, promote
better knowledge and skills, and help people live longer, healthier lives. The Bank's support
under this pillar was framed by the integrated Human Development Programmatic Reform Loan
Series (PSRL - DPL) which set out three cross-cutting areas of focus: expanding coverage,
improving quality and efficiency, and strengthening governance and public sector management
in the social sectors. Under this "umbrella framework," the HD team delivered an integrated
package of:
Analytical and technical work with a programmatic approach, including AAA on public
expenditure tracking and management in the health sector (PETS-SUS study), hospitals
as the main health service provider, social assistance (the BRASA Programmatic), and
monitoring and evaluation (the BRAVA program), as well as the integrated HD
Technical Assistance Loan (HD TAL), covering support to health, education, and
household surveys (IBGE); and
Lending at the federal level, which provided support through innovative SWAP
mechanisms for "big ticket items," such as Family Health, disease surveillance
(VIGISUS 1 and 2), AIDS, the government's program to pilot and mainstream quality in
education (FUNDESCOLA), and the flagship social program "Bolsa Familia." Efforts at
the federal level were also reinforced by investments at the state level in Bahia (education
and health) and Ceara (education).
During this same time period, Brazil witnessed a historic improvement in social indicators.
Both poverty and inequality have fallen impressively since 2001, reaching historical lows.
The Gini coefficient, which measures inequality, fell from a three-decade average of 60 to 56.6
by 2006, its lowest level in three decades. Poverty has fallen from 34.1 percent in 2003 to 29.5

Annex page 15

percent in 2005, and extreme poverty has fallen from 14.5 percent to 11 percent over that same
period. Transfers from the well-targeted Bolsa Familia Program explain 25 percent and 18
percent respectively of the reduction in extreme poverty and inequality in Brazil; improvements
in access to schooling and labor markets also contributed significantly to these gains. Moreover,
service coverage increased substantially for family health and an important inter-government
financing mechanism (FUNDEB) was legislated to extend coverage of pre-primary and
secondary schooling.
The current CPS will sharpen our focus on HD's contribution to the "equity agenda" - and will
broaden that focus to concurrently recognize the importance of human capital and innovations
for the "growth agenda." Despite historical progress on social indicators, challenges remain on
the equity agenda, in terms of expanding job and income opportunities for the poor by
strengthening their human capital and in terms of strengthening the affordability, quality and
efficiency of service delivery. Significant regional disparities also remain, in poverty,
educational attainment, and infant- and child-mortality. Similarly, strengthening human capital is
crucial to the growth agenda, in terms of developing a higher-skilled, healthier and more agile
labor force that is able to innovate and adapt innovations to boost total factor productivity.

Paradigmatic Issues Facing Brazil in Human Development
Brazil faces two cross-cutting paradigmatic challenges in human development: (a) the need
to build a more qualified, agile and healthy labor force capable of innovating and adapting
new innovations in technology; and (b) poor quality of spending and service delivery.
Both of these challenges underpin Brazil's growth and equity agendas, since improved human
capital and social spending and service delivery help build opportunities not only for the poor,
but also for the economy as a whole.
In health, despite progress, Brazil faces the multiple challenges of unrelenting cost, quality,
and access pressures facing the health care system. There has been significant progress in
increasing life expectancy and in reducing infant (28 per 1,000 births) and maternal mortality (75
per 100,000 births). The country's goal for 2020 is to conquer childhood diseases, minimize
preventable non-communicable diseases, lower inequality in outcomes, reduce disparity in risk
exposure and deliver high quality services efficiently, accountably and affordably. However, this
agenda faces a number of obstacles. As in education, the health system suffers from "low bang
for the buck". Both spending and mortality are in the upper tier (20 percent) among Latin
American countries due to the poor quality of care, low efficiency in public spending and
inadequate performance accountability. Hospitals, many of which are small and overstaffed,
consume 70 percent of sector spending. Although health service coverage is no longer a key
challenge, inequity persists in the quality of service. Compared to the top income quintile, the
lowest income quintile has 80 percent as much vaccination coverage, and 97 percent as many
births in hospitals, but in outcomes, the lowest income quintile has 2.9 times as much infant
mortality and 3.7 times as much child (under 5) mortality.
In addition, as the population ages and incomes increase, the burden of disease shifts toward
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), Brazil will inevitably face the ticking time bomb of health
casts that other countries have faced. Already representing over two-thirds of Brazil's disease
burden, NCDs typically affect the poor, have a significant productivity impact and are costly to
treat and long lasting. However, they are often less expensive to prevent. This shift toward noncommunicable diseases requires a shift in focus, away from curative care and towards
prevention, and away of acute care toward integrated care management. The challenge going
Annex page 16

forward is for the Government to finish the job of addressing infectious and childhood diseases,
but at the same time intensify the focus on NCDs and the elderly. At the same time there is a
critical need to: (a) promote accountability and performance links in health financing; (b) raise
the efficiency and quality of public spending (shifting from "paying five-star prices for three-star
services"); and (b) rationalize service supply and financing, while increasing a f f ~ r d a b i l i t ~ . ~
In education, despite progress in expanding coverage, Brazil must face the challenges of
improving quality, performance and outcomes - or miss opportunities for growth and
poverty reduction. Brazil spends (4. 3 percent of GDP) about the average of Latin American
countries and less than the OECD country average on education, but spending per student is low
given the young structure of the population, the large amount of resources directed toward
tertiary education and high spending on teacher's pensions. The educational system suffers from
the highest repetition rate in Latin America (some 20 percent of students repeat, the next closest
country in Latin America is Guatemala with a repetition rate of 14 percent) and low education
attainment - the population over 15 years has on average only 4.8 years of schooling. The
situation is worse for the poor who enter the system late, leave early and repeat more. By age 15,
poor youths have completed three years less schooling than the non-poor. The quality of
education is a key issue: over half of Brazil's 15 year old students are functionally illiterate and
close to 80 percent are not performing at basic numeracy levels. The situation is even more dire
considering these tests don't include those not in school. In this context, key development
challenges in education and skills include: (a) improving the quality of spending and service
delivery in a decentralized context so as to improve Brazil's "bang-for-the buck" in education
(outcomes for spending); (b) strengthening accountability and performance orientation;
(c) reducing repetition and age-grade distortions; and (d) improving the enabling environment to
encourage private investments in research and development, while improving the effectiveness
of public investments in this area.
In social policy, impressive gains in reducing poverty and inequality associated with the
Bolsa Familia Program must now also be extended to strengthened human capital impacts
and expanded labor opportunities for the poor. Brazil's Bolsa Familia Program (BFP) has
clearly had a huge redistributive impact, accounting for 25 percent and 18 percent respectively of
the reduction in extreme poverty and inequality in Brazil (See Box 4).8 Building on these gains,
efforts should be made to strengthen the program's impacts on human capital for long-run
poverty reduction - for example, by extending incentives for youths to stay in school (expanding
eligibility to youths aged 15-17) and for school cycle completion. Brazil also needs to find
institutionally-feasible ways of helping enhance the "employability" and productivity of the
working poor so as to help them graduate from poverty. To do so, BFP beneficiaries should also
be linked to complementary programs, in order to: (a) build the skills of the working poor and
youths (e.g., through lifelong learning, literacy and adult education programs, and job training);
(b) enhance the ability of the poor to connect to (better) jobs (e.g., through tailored
intermediation services and job information schemes); and (c) other productivity-enhancing
activities (such as rural development projects, micro credit, etc.). Proactive outreach efforts to
bring in hard-to-reach populations (such as the indigenous and quilombolas) are also needed.

Besides being complex in their own right and in Brazil's decentralized context, these
paradigmatic challenges tend to span across sectors. Indeed, the issues of governance,
bridging the economic and social inclusion agendas, innovation and human capital, and the rise
of non-communicable diseases all require actions by a multitude of inter-sectoral actors.
World Bank Support

With these paradigmatic challenges, the World Bank's support for Human Development in
Brazil will focus on helping Governments at various levels (federal and sub-national) to
strengthen the quality and efficiency of social service delivery and spending, with a view to
building human capital for both the equity and growth agendas. Within the same objective, IFC
will seek to leverage private sector resources, via direct investments, advisory services, local
capital markets (notably in relation to student loans), as well as supporting PPPs.
Given the need for selectivity and the fact that the Bank is a relatively small "niche" player that
can leverage impact by partnering with the Government on more complex challenges, we will do
support for inputs (except in transition states that still require significant investments in
infrastructure - these may, in turn, be supported by IFC), expansion of coverage (particularly
given our relatively small size), or isolated vertical disease campaigns, Instead, we will "move
up the value-added chain" with more support for efforts to partner with the clients to tackle
systemic and transformative issues of quality, efficiency and public sector management in the
delivery of social services. Links between systemic reforms at the federal level and investments
in quality and performance at the state level will also be actively promoted.
The Bank's support will involve an integrated package in which programmatic technical
and analytical work reinforces lending at both the federal and sub-national levels, and vice
versa:
In health, the Bank's strategy will help governments (federal and sub-national) find
sustainable solutions to the unrelenting cost, quality, and access pressures facing their health care
systems. This will be achieved by addressing the complex challenges of: (a) aligning incentives
and strengthening accountabilities to improve the efficiency of resource use, raise the quality of
care; and contain escalating costs; (b) boosting the health system's ability to handle the rise in
non-communicable diseases (NCDs); and (c) addressing market failures in private insurance and
provision. Bank support would address the issues of incentives, system accountability, and
NCD readiness with a focus on transforming finance and delivery systems in the following
federal lending streams: (a) SWAps to improve performance on primary care (Family Health 2)
and complex care (Qualisus); (b) a possible "umbrella" SWAP to partner with the Government's
program and provide technical assistance for institutional strengthening in an integrated manner.
An AAA program would seek to (a) further assess the issues of quality, efficiency, and
governance in Brazil's decentralized health system - particularly in light of the recent adoption
of the inter-government health pacts (Pactos de Sazide); and (b) examine problems in the private
insurance and provision markets and their effect on public and private health spending. Support
at the state level is also promising, via multi-sectoral SWAps focused on health sector reforms,
quality and efficiency. Some projects currently in the pipeline include substantial health
components in proposed SWAps or SILs in the following states: the Federal District, Bahia,
Acre, Minas Gerais, and Ceara.

Annex page 18

In education, the proposed program would support the Government's strategy for basic
education ("PDE" - Plano de Desenvolvimento de Educaqiio") and accompanying mechanisms
to monitor outcomes and implementation (IDEB) and to promote performance and quality
improvements (e.g., the Planos de Aq6es Articuladas - PAR, and the PDE-Escola plans, etc.).
In terms of lending, these efforts would be supported at two levels: (a) at the strategic and policy
level in the Federal Government, possibly through an "umbrella" operation (such as a SWAp) to
partner with the Government's program and provide technical assistance for institutional
strengthening; and (b) at the state level (most likely through multi-sectoral SWAps or SILs) to
help strengthen the implementation of the education strategy and quality improvements in
service delivery. Indeed, support on education already constitutes core components of SWAps
or SILs in the following states: Pernambuco, Federal District, Acre, Minas Gerais, and Ceara.
This lending program will benefit from several strategic AAA programs in education, including
(a) a programmatic on Knowledge and Innovation for Competitiveness (with state-level
applications); (b) a programmatic AAA on public spending in education; and (c) analytical work
on early childhood development.
In social protection, the proposed program would continue to support the Government's
flagship social program, Bolsa Familia, as well as broader linkages across the pillars of social
protection (social assistance, social insurance, labor), with other human development sectors
(health, education, training and lifelong learning), and with "productive activities" (such as the
PCPR projects, micro-credit, etc.). In terms of lending in the next two years, we would continue
with preparation of the second Bolsa Familia SWAp, with an emphasis on: (a) bridging the social
and economic inclusion agendas to connect BFP beneficiaries to education, skills and productive
opportunities; (b) expanding coverage to hard-to-reach populations; and (c) continued support
for strengthening implementation quality and monitoring and evaluation. Opportunities could
also be pursued for engagement at the sub-national level. This lending program would be
complemented by a program of AAA focused on "the jobs agenda for the poor" (the "labor
AAA").

Infrastructure and Urban Development

Overview of Bank program
Restoring and renewing the country's infrastructure and the development of urban areas
are imperative for growth, environmental protection and greater inclusion of the poor in
Brazil. Bank support to these sectors during the CPS period will contribute primarily to
advancing results under the competitiveness pillar - in line with Government's priority on
growth, while also meeting the challenges of the sustainability and equity pillars. The
infrastructure agenda is a complex one, involving multiple sectors (transport, water, energy,
housing); spatial dimensions (national, regional, metropolitan, urban and rural), and objectives
(basic services, competitiveness and natural resource protection). While Brazil's infrastructure
compares well with other Latin American countries, it fares less well with international peers.
Notably, the quality and efficiency of transport services lags well behind its East-Asian
competitors, including China and India. An additional challenge relates to the infrastructure
needs of the ever-growing urban and metropolitan areas, in terms of providing basic services to
citizens, while avoiding the congestion and spill-over effects of this growth on other aspects of
the economy and environment (e.g. water resources, air quality).

Annex page 19

Improvements in multi-modal transport routes and logistics, meeting increasing energy
demand, promoting more efficient service delivery models and creating jobs in cities are
critical to advancing the growth agenda. Poor logistics and insufficient infrastructure increase
transport costs and reduce Brazil's competitiveness. Investment climate assessments indicate that
enterprises are most impacted by transport damage and electricity outages. In addition, irrigated
agriculture provides an important opportunity for improving incomes, and the sector is
transitioning fiom a model based on rural welfare to one of more cornrnercially-oriented
agricultural production. Bank support to improving infrastructure for growth will focus on
overcoming remaining regulatory constraints; strengthening the public sector's ability to plan,
structure and follow through on idrastructure transactions; and leveraging much needed private
investment to complement the increased public resources being put forth through the PAC.
Balancing conservation with development is equally important for infrastructure and
urban services and is a core element of the sustainability pillar of the CPS. Brazil already
leads the world in adopting a clean energy matrix and the Bank will support its efforts to meet
increased demand through providing technical assistance on demand for major, controversial
energy generation, promoting energy efficiency, renewables and low-carbon solutions. Bank
support to the water sector will put forth economic and institutional instruments to allocate water
rights, introduce more effective management models, reduce pollution loads and deal with
scarcity issues. Work in the road sector will continue to be associated with land use planning
and creation of protected areas while urban transport will support measures to improve air
pollution and reduce accidents. Regarding urban development, the focus will be on improving
city competitiveness. When approved borrowers ask for Bank help with improving urban
competitiveness, the Bank will also consider complementary "brown agenda" investments
(sanitation, drainage and land issues to reduce slum formation, especially in environmentally
risky areas). Across all infrastructure sectors, the Bank will support capacity building efforts for
the implementation of state-of -the art environmental and social safeguards as integral
components of expanding services.
Finally, in support of the equity pillar of the CPS, the Bank will continue to help
government scale-up approaches for increasing access to sustainable infrastructure and
urban services to those still without. Although there have been some improvements, there are
significant gaps in rural areas and in access for the poor to all types of infrastructure including
electricity, potable water and housing. The lack of access to improved water supply is mainly a
rural issue, with two-thirds of the 34 million people without services living in rural areas, while
the 60 million people without appropriate sanitation are evenly split between urban and rural
areas. In fact, it is expected that the MDGs for sanitation will not be met. In all instances the
Bank will review engagement on pro-poor infrastructure in light of the overriding concern with
improving growth. In many instances these concerns are complementary - for example poor
quality public transport in urban areas (a) affects economic efficiency; and (b) places a much
higher burden on the poor who typically have to travel long distances, at high costs, to commute
to work.
Key Challenges
Logistics costs are high in Brazil and affect competitiveness. World Bank estimates that
logistics costs, (including administration, warehousing, inventories and transportation), are
approximately 15-18.4 percent of GDP. Logistics costs in Brazil are twice as high as in the
United States and are lagging well behind the average in OECD countries. This affects
industries' capacity to compete efficiently within Brazil and abroad, and in turn, casts doubts on
Annex page 20

the ability of the country to sustain growth at rates of 4 percent or higher. Operational efficiency
of railway services has improved significantly since privatization, but efficiency of ports and
customs services remains low, with slow progress observed on modernization efforts. The road
mode heavily dominates transport modes, both for short- and long-distance transport of freight
and passengers. This largely contributes to overall high transport costs, as other, much cheaper,
transport modes (especially waterborne and rail transport modes) remain under-developed, and
inter-modal services remain incipient. The deterioration of road conditions, resulting from
cutbacks in maintenance works in recent years, has also been a key factor in explaining high
transport costs. In addition, progress on the urban transport agenda remains extremely
challenging as it needs to address simultaneously ever-increasing urban congestion, respond to
demands for provision of better metropolitan passenger transport services, as well as ensure that
the main cities can efficiently play their role as transport hubs.
The role of cities in supporting economic growth is fundamental, however many Brazilian
. ~ the past 30 years, Brazil has undergone a major change in its
cities are under s t r e ~ s Over
spatial structure, with urban areas absorbing over 80 million people and the urban share of the
population growing from 56 to over 80 percent. Today cities account for 90 percent of the
country's GDP and house half of its poor. After consistent productivity increases in the 1970s
and 1980s the largest Brazilian cities have shown a steady decline in per capita GDP and
productivity over the last 15 years. In addition, cities in Brazil are grappling with the need to
host millions of poor people, control crime and violence, improve services and clean up the
environment. As one of the most urbanized countries in the world and one of its largest
economies, Brazil's competitiveness and prospects for sustainable growth rest on the capacity of
its major cities to respond to these pressures. While Brazil's largest cities are still by far the
most productive in the urban hierarchy, their problems call for decisive responses to enable them
to maintain their dynamism, which will be reflected in the country's economic growth and
international competitiveness.
Water is a key element of Brazil's strategy to promote sustainable growth and a more
equitable and inclusive society. While Brazil's achievements over the last 50 years have been
aimed at the development of its water resources and expansion of its water supply and sanitation
(WSS) services, important challenges still remain for the country. Primary water resources
issues are related to scarcity (especially in Northeast region but also in large metropolitan areas
like Siio Paulo), pollution (in most urban areas, and more so in the Southeast), and recurrent
droughts and floods (which could be exacerbated by climate change and increased hydrological
variability). Brazil faces daunting challenges to expand and improve water services. The access
gap is exacerbated by the challenging need to improve service efficiency and quality. Finally,
water plays a key role in supporting the development of hydropower and navigation
infrastructure, which are essential for sustained growth. In Brazil, the allocation of water across
competing uses also involves complex trade-offs between environmental conservation and
economic development, especially in the Amazon and Paranh river basins.
Over the last two decades investment in infrastructure has fallen dramatically and was the
major constraint to service expansion. From an average of 5.22 percent in the 1980s,
investment spending dropped to under 2 percent of GDP in the early 2000s and continued at this
level through the past few years (See Table 1). This drop was caused in part by the severe fiscal

adjustment efforts Brazil made over the period, as well as the gradual expansion of current
spending, as well as by a limited private sector involvement (with the notable exception of the
telecommunications and electricity generation sectors). In addition, little progress has been
made in improving quality of expenditures, which has not allowed the optimal use of the scarce
resources available.

The way forward
The PAC is the proposed Government response to this decades-long under-investment in
infrastructure and urban services for the poor. It sets targets for public infrastructure
spending during 2007-2010 of over R$500 billion (more than half going to energy projects), to
be financed mostly by public enterprises and gradual increases in public spending. In addition
to planning the execution of large energy and logistics infrastructure projects, the PAC is also
proposing investments in public credit for housing, water and sanitation and other urban services.
There is an urgent need to strengthen the enabling environment to allow the PAC
objectives to be substantially met. First, there is a need for a consolidated approach to
infrastructure planning to coherently and systematically identify and prioritize (on the basis of
objective criteria) long term infrastructure needs. Sectoral plans have been put in place at the
federal level in energy, water resource management, and transport; directives have been issued
requiring master plans for urban development, water supply and sanitation at the local levels,
while states also have their own planning process. These plans have been structured in isolation
of each other, and better coordination among the multiple entities involved in infrastructure in
Brazil is required.
Second, there is a need to increase the availability of bankable projects (in terns of quality,
technical viability and cost benefit analysis), and the ability to bring them to fruition, taking into
account the generally low technical capacity of executing agencies and the lengthy
administrative processes (at feasibility study, design preparation, bidding, environmental
licensing, and litigation stages) - all of which lead to huge delays (and thus cost overruns)
between the time the decision is taken to undertake a project, and the time the project is executed
(for large infrastructure projects, such time exceeds 15 years). Strengthening public sector
decision-making and executing agencies' capacity and streamlining of procedures are solutions
to these problems.
Third, sonre regulatory and policy gaps still need to be addressed to complete the reform
agenda and consolidate the policy framework in some sectors (i.e., energy and transport),
eliminate uncertainties (i.e., in water and sanitation) and make better use of public funds to

Annex page 22

leverage private investment (i.e., housing finance and subsidy policy), while also training public
officials, raising the effectiveness of regulatory agencies and of the judicial, and improving
contract design to avoid excessive contract renegotiations.'0 Reducing these regulatory barriers
will provide incentives to the private sector to meet the private financing expectations under the
PAC.
The Bank Group's Proposed Response

A strong demand for Bank support to the infrastructure sectors is expected during the CPS period
in response to the ambitious investment targets set forth in the PAC, while states and
municipalities have a desire to leverage new-found fiscal space and borrowing capacity to make
up for years of under-investment in these sectors. Further demand is also expected by the private
sector, in terms of access to long term financing and advisory services (facilitate PPPs and apply
high standards in sustainability - environmental, social, and corporate governance). This CPS
period also marks a shift in the nature of Bank support, from the provision of basic services (for
example, rural water and electricity, slum upgrading in isolated area), to a broader program that
includes infrastructure within a context of economic growth and environmental and fiscal
sustainability. The Bank has prepared detailed strategies for transport, energy, water and urban
development which outline objectives, selectivity filters and opportunities for support to the
Brazilian government.
Topics that are cross-cutting to all Bank Group infrastructure strategies are:
improved quality and efficiency of public expenditures by increasing effectiveness of
selected public infrastructure programs, introducing resource allocation priorization
mechanisms, results-based management and better project design, as well as modernizing
information systems and processes;
more focused attention on long-term planning to define priority investments within and
across sectors and levels of government, including IFC building long-term relations with
Tier I and Tier I1 clients;
strengthened regulatory, policy and institutional environment;
introduction of innovative service delivery models and structuring of large
investment projects to take advantage of the large spectrum of public-private
partnership options;
building capacity and improved procedures for mainstreaming social and
environmental issues into infrastructure investment decision-making, promoting
sustainability in the private sector; and
facilitating access to long-term financing for the private sector.
The Bank's proposed program in these sectors at the federal level may include a
partnership with BNDES, SWAp investment operations in support of selected public
investment programs, and technical assistance (TA) to sectoral ministries, to be delivered
as part of investment operations, specific TALs, non-lending TA, ESWs and fee-based
services. SWAP investment operations will focus on improving the efficiency of public
investment programs aiming at maintaining and upgrading key infrastructure services in an
environmentally and socially sustainable manner. TA activities financed with Bank resources

I0

SeeWorld Bank.2007. How to Revitalize Infrastructure Investments in Brazil. Report No. 36624-BR.

Annex page 23

will focus on topics specifically requested by the clients and of priority to the Bank. With
respect to TALs, lessons from the previous CAS show that while small sector-specific TALs
(currently implemented in energy, housing, logistics, and water and sanitation) are effective for
advancing policy dialog, they are administratively cumbersome and slow to disburse. During this
CPS, a more efficient form of packaging this TA and other AAA (e.g. ongoing work in freight
logistics, city competitiveness and energy security) will be developed. The Bank will also need
to find instruments to allow for agile, just-in-time responses to specific requests, as was the case,
for example, on designing the Rio Madeira auction process, restructuring the civil aviation sector
or designing bidding documents for port dredging. Fee-for-service work pioneered in the
irrigation sector may also be expanded.
States are also requesting large levels of support in the infrastructure sectors. In all cases
the Bank will follow the "principled opportunism" approach of this CPS. Within this context,
states are already making use of a range of lending instruments to meet their investment needs.
In some cases, traditional SILs are still the preferred method, with some innovation, as in the
case of Sgo Paulo, where a large portfolio of projects was put forth jointly to COFIEX in an
attempt to achieve economies of scale and reduce transactions costs. In other cases, as in Minas
and Ceara, infrastructure will be supported as a component of a large multi-sectoral, resultsbased SWAp, which focus more on improving public sector management and supporting
expenditure programs. Another variation in use of instruments is a SWAP which would support a
state sectoral program, possibly with some components using output-based disbursements.
The Transport Sector
Transport looms large on the agenda of both Federal Government and many State
Governors. The transport sector is therefore expected to continue to represent a large share of
Bank investment lending in Brazil. Four business lines make up the Bank strategy:

Reduce logistic costs
improve main transport corridors through resolution of localized logistic
(a)
bottlenecks and the main federal and state road networks;
advance the port reform agenda;
(c)
foster decentralization of federal transport infrastructure of local interest to
(d)
the state and municipal levels; and
private sector investments (ports, roads, rail).
(e)
Support to the Bank urban strategy
improve efficiency and coverage of public transport services in large
(a)
cities, with a pro-poor and air quality focus;
support to fast-growing medium-sized cities with critical transit problems,
(b)
by upgrading and making financially viable public transport and
promoting PSP for "smart" and sustainable development of these cities;
(c)
improve inter-city coordination; and
pro-urban poor private sector investment improving access to basic
(d)
services (electricity, transport, water), including via microfinance and
housing finance.

Annex page 24

Effectiveness of public expenditure programs
increase planning capacity, with the view of fostering multimodality and
(a)
developing alternatives to gradually rebalance the transport matrix;
improve effectiveness of specific public infrastructure programs;
(b)
(c)
increase private sector participation in infrastructure, through
consolidation of the regulation and anti-trust frameworks, and
strengthening of capacity in structuring, bidding and supervising the
execution of PPPs - making use of the BNDESIIFC PPP facility; and
TA to improve fiscal management capacity at the federal and state levels.
(d)
Support to sustainable regional development at the state level, including:
(a)
connectivity improvements between rural areas and main transport
corridors;
improvements to local planning capacity; and
(b)
increased capacity to protect biodiversity and manage natural resources in
(c)
a sustainable fashion, through consolidation of state systems of protected
areas, and design of economic incentives to land management.
Highlights of Bank activities in the transport sector as part of the proposed CPS program include
at the federal level the implementation of the recently approved Road Transport Project SWAP
and associated TA to improve quality of expenditures in the road sector, support to increased
efficiency in other transport modes (airports, ports, waterways) and continued IBRDIIFC
partnership in the structuring of PPPs. Regarding regional development and improved quality of
expenditures in the states, work will continue on: urban transportation systems, with reference to
S5o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and in the design and implementation of stand-alone road projects
for regional development (Tocantins, Bahia, Goias, S5o Paulo, Paraiba) or as part of multisectoral state SWAP (e.g. Minas Gerais). Analytical work will continue in the area of freight
logistics as well as understanding transport issues as part of the Amazon partnership framework.

Energy Sector
During the CPS period, when there are requests from the Federal Government and State
Governments, the main principles of the energy sector strategy will address three thematic areas
and proposed implementation mechanisms, as follows:

>

Universal access by targeting electricity provision for the poor rural population, using
new models for reaching areas currently not supplied (including Amazonia) and focusing
on the productive use of electricity as a driver for rural growth. This would be through
seeking linkages between Luz para Todos and PCPRs as well as with GEF support for
off-grid energy, among others.

>

Provision of energy for growth through the structuring and implementation of large
scale public sector projects and coordination with IFC to attract private investment. This
would also involve improving long-term planning instruments to sharpen selection
criteria and use of hydrographic basins in a more widespread manner. It would also
involve boosting the public sector's capacity to fully track the implementation and
monitoring of energy sector investments, mitigate the risk of potential bottlenecks due to
potential shortages and better integrate regional development aspects into the very large
scale energy projects.
Annex page 25

P Expand the role of clean energy through analytic work for biofuels, energy efficiency,
hydropower and other links to reduced emissions and mitigating climate change. Focus
in these areas and on improvement to the framework for clean energy would be targeted
through the better integration with the Brazilian carbon market (with Caixa Economica
Federal and BMF). Given Brazil's substantial progress and its relatively clean energy
matrix, the Bank program would support Brazil's efforts to share its experience with
partners worldwide.
All three of these areas would be pursued by increasing the scope of the ESTAL (or similar TA
instrument) with the Ministry of Mines and Energy, possible financing of investments (using
IBRD, sub-national finance for SOEs and/or IFC), and continued analytical work in regulatory
reform and improvements to policies.
IFC will look for opportunities to play a role in Brazil's power sector given the large
investment needs required (Annex 5). IFC will be selective in its investments, which could
include the following objectives: (a) to support the development of hydroelectric power plants
on a corporate or project finance basis, by complementing BNDES financing (i.e. items not
eligible for BNDES financing); (b) to support the repowering of existing hydroelectric power
plants to improve their efficiency as well as to create additional capacity; (c) if the fuel is
available and secured, to support gas and coal fired power plants; (d) to support concessions of
transmission lines; (e) to support distribution companies with local financing (via the Real-linked
loan or a partial credit guarantee) for the expansion and improvement of their distribution
network; and (f) to support companies that are developing renewable energy projects, i.e. groups
of small hydros (PCHs), wind, biomass. IBRD will collaborate with andlor complement IFC role
with respect to the implementation of this strategy in the remaining public part of the sector.
Urban Development

The urban strategy is anchored in the following four themes, which will be addressed in an
integrated fashion:
(a) improving the fiscal capacity, management and credit-worthiness of cities with a
long-term view of strengthening the municipal credit market and access to private
financing;
(b) increasing city competitiveness, local economic development and job creation;
(c) scaling-up the delivery of basic services in a fiscally and environmentally sound
manner; and
(d) promoting greater partnerships across cities, in metropolitan governance, with
external actors and as part of a broader regional development perspective.
The Urban Development agenda will broaden away from delivering discrete municipal
loans to a more comprehensive approach of tackling federal policy issues, support state and
regional development programs and promoting the economic development of cities. The
Bank began working with direct lending to municipalities on a pilot basis in the last CAS. This
effort proved to be challenging as the project preparation cycle turned out to be extremely long
on all sides and development impact very localized. The Federal Government has specified that
the Bank will only engage with municipalities under special circumstances (typically where there
are consortia of municipalities dealing with major challenges, such as water and environment in
metropolitan Sao Paulo), when there are significant externalities (such as with the port in the
Baixada Santista) and when the project will generate revenues for the municipality. In general
Annex page 26

the Government does not want the Bank lending to municipalities when resources are available
from domestic sources, such as from the Ministry of Cities. For the dozen or so existing Bankfinanced municipal projects, a knowledge exchange and learning mechanism is being put in
place to support these projects and link them to the evolving agenda on Competitive Cities and
federal policy dialogue.
At the federal level, Bank support to the urban agenda may, if requested by the Federal
Government, continue to address federal policy in housing finance and streamlining of
housing subsidies (which also involves close coordination with Ministry of Finance, the
Central Bank, C E F and private banks) and support holistic slum upgrading programs (as
part of the Housing TAL and related to the PAC). This will provide an additional impetus
to IFC's developing housing finance program with a special focus on lower and middle
income housing. Tackling the issue of land regularization is an important element of this
agenda. The active AAA and advocacy support will also continue, including through the WBI
program with ESAF, and will promote the importance of competitive cities and introduce best
practice for stimulating local economic development. Finally, TA provided by IFC on
administrative simplification to improve the business environment at the municipal level will be
more closely coordinated with the IBRD program to maximize impact.
Water Sector
During the CPS period the Bank will build on its longstanding programs a t the federal
level and continue to improve institutional capacity and deepening reform at the state and
municipal levels. Support will be addressed within and across the four main lines of business
and opportunities for Bank engagement, as follows: (i) improving water resources management,
(ii) expanding and improving water supply and sanitation, (iii) developing more effective
irrigation, and (iv) multi-sector, integrated approaches to complex infrastructure. As progress is
made in those areas, together with the support of IFC7sadvisory program possibly involving the
PPP facility, IFC may assist in mobilizing private sector resources.
A greater degree of integration and coordination across these lines of business will also be
pursued and has been facilitated by the internal restructuring of the Bank. Within and
across each business line, the Bank will focus on the following thematic issues: (i) strengthening
of policies, regulatory frameworks and institutions; (ii) improving sectoral and investment
planning and project monitoring instruments; (iii) introducing innovative service delivery models
(for example, public private partnerships in irrigation and urban water supply, corporate
governance and access to financial markets by state owned operators, and results-based
approaches for efficiency gains, service expansion and pollution reduction); and (iv)
international exchange of best practices, especially related to economic instruments.
More specifically, the envisaged program will contemplate:
(a) Improving Water Resources Management. Upon request, the Bank will continue to
support the National Water Agency and Ministry of Integration in: (i) managing water
stresses derived from scarcity and pollution in selected federal rivers (Paraiba do Sul, PCJ
and Sgo Francisco); (ii) advancing reforms at federal level for more effective use of
management instruments, especially water rights; (iii) improving monitoring, information
systems and knowledge base; and (iv) assessing development risks and trade-offs in
environmentally sensitive federal river basins (e.g. Upper Paraguay and Pantanal, key
Amazon sub-basins). PROAGUA is the main instrument to continue and strengthen such
Annex page 27

partnership. The Bank will also target states that have demonstrated their commitment to
improved WRM and where there is an opportunity for advancing reforms (including, for
example Ceara, Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, Siio Paulo, Pernambuco and others
(b) Expanding and improving WSS services. Bank assistance will, within the context of
the overall urban strategy, be willing to engage on: (i) innovative approaches and models
to expand services to the poor, especially in small towns, peri-urban areas of medium and
large cities, and rural communities; (ii) promoting sector efficiency and improved
financing, for example, by supporting the development of regulatory structures and the
implementation of WSS regulations to complement the law, fostering PPPs, assisting
non-dependent public WSS utilities in developing corporate governance and access to
capital markets, and scaling up the use of results-based approaches; and (iii) addressing
increasing challenges of the urban environmental agenda (e.g. water sources protection,
wastewater treatment and urban drainage) in large and medium-size metropolitan areas.
If requested by Government, the Bank could provide continued TA to the Ministry of
Cities (building on PMSS experience but with broader support to PAC) will be
complemented with state projects focusing on: (i) utility efficiency and corporate
governance (e.g. Siio Paulo and Pernambuco), (ii) pollution control (e.g. Siio Paulo and
Espirito Santo), (iii) new models for WSS services (e.g. rural Amazonas, Teresina), and
(iv) financial instruments for state WSS companies (with IFC sub-national financing).
(c) Developing more effective irrigation models. If requested, the Bank will continue its
assistance to the Federal Government for PPPs to revamp existing, and largely
underutilized, irrigation schemes in the semi-arid region, as well as to develop green-field
projects, building on the work already started with IFC.
(d) Multi-sector, integrated approaches to complex infrastructure, such as the Siio
Francisco inter-basin transfer, development of untapped potential of waterways in the
Parana and Amazon rivers, and further development of hydropower in the Amazon.
Upon request the Bank will provide assistance to the "desafios paradigmaticos" which
abound in this sector. This might include assistance on water resources management and
institutional aspects of the Siio Francisco project. The Bank would also be prepared to
provide assistance to hydropower and navigation projects which are also top priorities for
the Federal Government and important elements of the national development agenda.
Because of the location of many of these projects in environmentally sensitive biomes,
such as the Amazon, additional complex challenges emerge related to balancing
conservation and development, and in some cases, trans-boundary issues.
(e) Regional and Global Exchanges: the Bank Group will strengthen its role on facilitating
exchange of experiences and best practices by improving dialogue on global and regional
issues, disseminating Brazilian best practice within Brazil and abroad and demonstrating
best practice from international experience. For example, the Bank could assist the
country in: (i) addressing key sector issues that involve global concerns (e.g.
contributions and adaptation to climate change); (ii) fostering coordinated efforts to
address large trans-boundary issues in partnership with OTCA, Cuenca del Plata,
Mercosur, regarding the Amazon, the Parana river, and the Guarani aquifer; (iii)
disseminating Brazilian innovations such as the results-based initiative on wastewater
treatment and corporate governance and access to capital markets by state owned utilities,
(iv) promoting south-south and north-south cooperation on water allocation policies and
Water Resource Management economic instruments.

Agriculture and Natural Resource Management

Paradigmatic Issues Facing Brazil in Agriculture and Natural Resource Management
With the rapid rise in international demand for a wide variety of Brazil's agricultural
products, balancing agricultural development with sustainable management of natural
assets will be essential. Brazil leads the world's exports in a number of agricultural
commodities (soybeans, beef, sugar, ethanol and others), but unsustainable land use practices
have left roughly 10 percent of areas so highly degraded that they have been abandoned. There
is now wide understanding in Brazil that this cycle of use, abandonment and then opening of new
lands for agriculture has high costs and a direct environmental impact on the availability and
quality of water resources and the local and regional climate.

Brazil thus recognizes that it faces the challenge of increasing productivity and intensifying land
use in order to maintain the growth of agricultural production and exports without putting its
natural resource base at risk. Fortunately the partnership of EMBRAPA and the private sector
has been successful in developing high-yielding, regionally adapted, and conservation-focused
technologies for Brazil's tropical agriculture. EMBRAPA, the private sector, state extension
agencies and NGOs need to step up these public-private partnerships to mainstream these and
future by developing innovative organizational and financial mechanisms.

Building and sustaining market chains for higher value added products is an important input
into higher agricultural productivity and sustainability. This requires: integrating laborintensive medium-size and small producers who can expand high value specialty crops;
demonstrating certifiable environmentally and socially sustainable production methods; and
improving containment of animal diseases to prevent losing access to international markets.

Each of these areas has strong governance dimensions. Public land policies need to ensure that
farmers' increased access to land is in areas with good potential market access and is
accompanied by knowledge of environmentally sustainable techniques. Federal and state land
titling and environmental agencies need to provide a stronger foundation for producers to
Annex page 29

demonstrate their legality and environmental compliance. Public phytosanitary agencies need to
upgrade their ability to prevent the spread of animal diseases present in South America.
Balancing improved agricultural productivity with sustainable management of natural
assets also requires efforts the provision of basic infrastructure to support rural production,
processing and marketing. This ranges from rural energy supply (often off-grid) and provision
of water supply and sanitation to better access to irrigation and improved transportation
(waterways, roads, and rail), all of which need to be designed and executed within a regional
development focus. Investment in basic infrastructure, with a focus on regional development, is
required to improve value added and employment, as well as to support cost reductions that are
crucial to maintaining Brazil's competitiveness in agriculture. All of these investments can yield
significant opportunities for improved value added and employment as well as cost reductions
which are crucial to Brazil's maintaining competitiveness (especially in the frame of increased
pressure for exchange rate appreciation if agricultural export shares in international markets are
successfully maintained as desired).

A fourth challenge for the agricultural and natural resource management sector which cuts
across each of the challenges discussed above to increasing productivity is that of climate
change. Given the increasing likelihood of temperature increases affecting Brazil in the coming
decades, Brazil must accelerate the current work being pursued by EMBRAPA to climate-proof
Brazilian agriculture. The development of temperature resistant crop varieties and the increase
in the sector's knowledge about future necessary crop shifts will be crucial adaptive steps to
avoiding impacts on the full range of agricultural producers and regions.
In addition to climate adaptation, agriculture can play a role in mitigating climate as well. One
of the potentially largest contributions to mitigation by agriculture will be the increased
production of ethanol from sugarcane. The expected conversion of 10-15 million hectares of
pasture and other crop areas in Brazil to sugarcane area would be enough to substitute for 5
percent of projected world gasoline consumption by 2030. For this emissions mitigation to be
fully successful, livestock productivity will have to increase in order to prevent an increase in
pasture area formed through deforestation.
Agriculture can further contribute to emissions mitigation through other productive efficiency
gains such as low-impact forestry and reduced deforestation, minimum tillage, improved feed to
reduce methane emissions from livestock, etc. These types of mitigation can have local and
regional benefits which even exceed global benefits. Innovative technologies and practices
developed both in Brazil and worldwide need to be more widely disseminated and promoted in
Brazil and can often lead to accessing additional financial benefits to producers through carbon
finance and emerging mechanisms for payments for environmental services. In this way, a
crucial additional factor can be brought to bear on accelerating technology adoption which
further promotes productivity and sustainability.
Seizing Opportunities for Innovative and Integrated Approaches to Sustainable Growth
In the last CAS, the Bank's strategy focused in the area of agricultural and natural
resource management on contributing to the sustainability and equity pillars, with an
emphasis on environmental conservation, mainstreaming integrated natural resource
management in productive landscapes, and rural poverty reduction through investment in basic
community level infrastructure. The focus on competitiveness was not given priority. The
current CPS aims to strengthen the focus on competitiveness and fwther the connectedness of the
Annex page 30

three pillars of the CPS by integrating the successes of each into one another and focusing on
innovative solutions to the Brazil's substantial opportunities for natural resource based growth.
The adjusted focus in the CPS places more emphasis on the areas of sustainable growth in
agricultural production, inclusion of small holders in agricultural market chains, and
strengthening of land and environmental institutions which are crucial in these two areas. It also
includes a return to engagement with EMBRAPA for institutional strengthening and the
mainstreaming of climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies into the institution's
research and development programs. This engagement aims to promote further productivity
growth, particularly in the livestock sector, greater cooperation with the private sector in the next
generation of biofuels, and greater integration with wider government programs for payments for
sustainable agricultural practices and hence environmental services.
Bank Support will be balanced between federal and sub-national levels and will involve an
integrated package in which analytical work reinforces lending at both these levels.
Economic and sector work on land administration, bio-fuels, environmental management,
degraded areas' potential, regional transportation, and climate change will be integrated to form
the technical base for multi-sectoral approaches. Greater integration with IFC: will focus on
disseminating innovation (e.g., systems for environmental licensing of agricultural producers and
agricultural product certification) through enterprises that are in conformity with the law or have
an interest to become more so (See Annex 5 - IFC support to agribusiness and to the Brazilian
Amazon).

This last area is crucial to catalyze structural change in the livestock sector, under which higher
land productivity through improved practices will be targeted. Here there is a dual link to
competitiveness. By emphasizing more intensive land use and achieving sustainable use of
pasture, livestock farmers will be able to maintain their access to world markets that increasingly
demand certification of environmental and social good practices. In turn, the emphasis of
adoption of new technologies usually tends to spur greater attention to profitability, further cost
reducing investments, and subsequent rounds of productivity growth.
At the federal level, the Bank would pursue engagement with the Ministry of Agriculture to
strengthen phytosanitary systems, with initial focus on a regional approach to hoof and mouth
disease. The Bank would also continue its historically strong relationship with EMBRAPA, with
the goal of promoting public-private partnerships for the formation of productive market chains
and for development of technologies for adaptation of agriculture to climate change. With both
the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Agrarian Development, the Bank would aim to
further the development of incentive programs for agricultural productivity and agribusiness
expansion to include medium-sized and small farmers and for promoting alternative uses of
degraded lands. With the Ministry of Agrarian Development and the Ministry of Environment
key program areas would include strengthening land administration and land reform focused on
more intensified use of natural resources in a certifiably sustainable manner and supporting the
introduction of mechanisms for payments for environmental services.
At the sub-national level working with states to widen the coverage of systems for
environmental licensing of agricultural producers (SLAPR) and to support to regularization of
land tenure would be main areas of focus. In the PCPR portfolio, less emphasis will be placed
on infrastructure and more on programs which generate agricultural SME growth and
agribusiness expansion. By working with state agricultural and environmental secretariats
sustainable agricultural practices would be targeted through projects which focus on minimizing

Annex page 3 1

soil erosion, water pollution, land degradation and land abandonment and generate links for
producers through carbon finance and other systems for payments for environmental services. In
the Northeast, a strengthened focus on water resources management and irrigation would be
adopted.

Annex page 32

Brazil is home to several sensitive biomes, most notably the Amazon, and balancing economic
development with conservation remains an on-going challenge. With a population of 24 million,
the Amazon region accounts for 13 percent of Brazil's population, compared to a GDP share of 7
percent. The population is less urban (roughly 68 percent as compared to 80 percent nationwide,
according to IBGE), and the services sector is less developed. The GDP share of the agriculture
(including forestry) and mining sectors (totaling almost one-quarter together) is considerably
higher than in the rest of Brazil. Manufacturing is relatively well developed (one-quarter of
GDP), but concentrated in very few areas and on par with industry's GDP share nationally (see
Figure 1 below)

Over 1975-2005, the Amazon region's GDP grew at more than double the national rate (7.2
percent vs. 3.3 percent) and export growth was even higher. In Para (the largest state in the
Amazon region in terms of population and GDP), 35 percent of GDP is export oriented (2004).
Still, the overall Human Development Index (HDI) level for states in the Amazon region is
roughly 10-15 percent below the average for Brazil as a whole, with the notable exception of
Amazonas and Mato Grosso. The main indicator which brings the HDI down is that of income
(as opposed to education or other social welfare indicators). Across the states in the Amazon
region, per capita income varies widely, from roughly 50 percent of the national average in Acre,
Para, Roraima, Tocantins, and Maranhilo to 70 percent in Amapa and RondBnia and to 80-100
percent in Amazonas and Mato Grosso. Overall, 45 percent of the population lives below the
poverty line.
Economic activity is very unevenly divided. Much of the region's economic wealth is generated
in: a) the Carajas triangle between Belem (PA), Siio Luis (MA) and Maraba (PA) with a
concentration of mining, hydroelectricity, aluminum smelting, and port activity; b) the Manaus
industrial pole whose Free Trade Zone produces a wide variety of consumer goods for domestic
consumption and export; and c) the Arc of Deforestation, stretching from eastern Para to Acre,
which involves cattle ranching, timber extraction and small-scale as well as large-scale
agriculture (it partially overlaps with "a" above)
The indigenous population amounts to approximately 200,000 people. There are over 200
known ethnic groups surviving in the area, with close to 170 indigenous languages still spoken,
reflecting the region's rich cultural diversity.

Annex page 33

Occupation of the Amazon by non-indigenous peoples was substantially accelerated by
government in the early 1960s with the building of federal roads and hydroelectric dams, the
encouragement to migration, organized (public and private) settlements, land concessions, tax
incentives and institutional credit. This process relied on substantial government support
through the 1980s, mainly in the states of Mato Grosso, Rondhnia, Para and ~aranhiio."
Government sup ort was reduced significantly in the early 1990s, although the tax incentive
scheme FINAM , and settlement schemes promoted by INCRA remained. Overall, the process
not only resulted in massive land clearing, mainly for livestock, but also stimulated the growth of
cities in the region and the appearance of new towns along the agricultural frontier.

!,

Amazonian ecosystems provide national and global services as a major carbon reservoir, as a
home to major biodiversity, as a producer of freshwater and other aquatic ecosystem services,
and as a regional climate regulator. The Brazilian Amazon forest covers over 4.1 million km2
and harbors, at least 2.5 million species of insects, tens of thousands of species of plants, 2,000
fish species, 950 birds and 200 mammal species, offering some of the greatest biodiversity in the
world. The Amazon rainforest plays a major role in influencing local and continental climate.
The evapo-transpiration is responsible for about half of the rainfall generated from the region,
which falls as far south as Siio Paulo. Mounting evidence from climate change models estimate
an a decrease of forest cover as low as 40 percent of the original area over the next 30 to 50 years
Most models, however, consider original vegetation cover without considering the annual
deforestation. Despite the resilience of forest ecosystems, there may be a point of "no return"
after which forest dieback could occur.
Deforestation averaged about 16,700 km.2 per year from 199 1 - 200 1, increased to an average of
24,600 krn2 per year from 2002-2004 and has decreased to 14,000 km2 in 2006 (Figure 2). Of the
original forest cover, nearly 18 percent have been cleared by 2006. Cattle ranching is the most
significant land use in those areas (over 70 percent) while, at least, a quarter of this area is not in
use. Carbon emissions from deforestation represent about 70 percent of Brazil's total annual
emissions which currently ranks as the fourth largest annual carbon emitter in the world.

Over 25 million cubic meters of round wood is harvested every year in the Amazon. While
logging moves generally ahead of the agricultural frontier, it is not considered as a driving force
of deforestation per se, but as a factor that facilitates access to forests and provides capital for

" The Bank supported the occupation (road paving, agricultural developnlent, health services and indigenous groups protection) through loans for
the POLONOROESTE program in the first two states, for the mining and transport complex of C a r a j b in Par& and an early settlement project in
MaranhAo.

clearing. Due to the unmanaged nature of most logging, local boom-and-bust cycles of
exploration are the result, forcing the migration of the industry from exhausted sub-regions to
virgin forests, and undermining economic and social stability of the population. Only a small
fraction of timber is coming from managed forests but areas of certified forests have reached
over 3 million ha in less than 10 years.
Recent developments in the Amazon highlight positive shifts towards the creation and
implementation of protected areas and indigenous land. The Government efforts, supported by
the Amazon Region Protect Areas program (ARPA), co-financed by the World Bank, resulted in
the creation of 22.3 million ha of protected areas since 2000, while the state of Para created 4.2
million hectares as proposed in its macrozoning. The Federal Government also regularized
another 40 million hectares of indigenous lands. Through the support of the Pilot Program, the
rights of indigenous people to about 18 percent of the Amazon have been ensured. Considering
that roughly two-thirds of Brazilian C 0 2 emissions are caused by deforestation, the creation and
consolidation of protected areas has likely contributed to Brazilian efforts to fight climate
change.

Bank Experience in the Region." Of the nine state governments, the Bank has been or is
currently involved with Acre, Amapa, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, MaranhBo, Para, Rond6nia and
Tocantins. (The Bank has never dealt directly as a lender with Roraima.) With Amazonas,
lending occurred only briefly in the late 1980s (an agricultural project). The current project in
Amazonas was approved by the Board in early 2008.
Over the past decade, the Bank worked with donor countries, the Federal Government and all
nine state governments in the preparation of the Rain Forest Pilot Program. The Bank also
prepared specific projects with different states such as Amazonas and Para in the case of
Provarzea, and Amazonas in the case of Ecological Corridors. Amazonian states have also been
beneficiaries of PROSANEAR and of a federal Amazonas Health Project (malaria control). The
current GEF Amazon Region Protected Areas project (ARPA) covers the states of Acre,
Amazonas, Amapa, Para, Rondhnia, and Mato Grosso. The AquaBio GEF Project focuses
especially on the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Amazonas. The Parh Integrated Rural
Development project started in 2007. The Bank approved an additional financing of the
PROAGUA project to support water resources management activities throughout the country,
including the Amazon states. The Bank is also currently preparing a multi-sectoral project with
the state of Acre with substantial focus on sustainable resource management.
The focus of all these efforts in the Amazon have been on: (i) strengthening governance and
building capacity, especially on environmental issues, (ii) creating and maintaining protected
areas and indigenous lands, and (iii) developing methods to sustainable manage existing natural
resources. In all cases there has been heavy emphasis on communications and consensus
building.
The Sustainable Amazon Plan. In May 2003, President Lula met with the governors of the North
region and a number of ministers to approve guidelines for a "Sustainable Amazon" program.
Development of the program was delegated to the Ministry of National Integration, with the
Ministry of Environment serving as secretariat. The resulting Sustainable Amazonia Plan (PAS)
sets out six objectives for the Amazon area: i) reduction of rural poverty and an increase in

13

For IFC see Annex 5

Annex page 35

social protection; ii) continued reduction in the structural deforestation rate; iii) improvement of
basic services, especially in rural communities; iv) designing major infrastructure projects which
address social and environmental aspects while supporting regional and national growth; v)
improving Amazonia's provision of global environmental services (biodiversity, carbon
reservoir, water cycle); and vi) supporting indigenous and traditional communities' ways of life.
Box I : The Amazon Protected Areas Project - ARPA is considered an example of
institutional arrangement and a model of operational support to the management of protected
areas. ARPA's financial resources are not disbursed through the Government but through an
NGO (Brazilian Biodiversity Fund - FUNBIO). Such an arrangement improves the project's
operational capacity, due to FUNBlO's greater flexibility in comparison with the Government
and to management innovations devised by FUNBIO. This type of institutional arrangement is
innovative in large-sized projects and will be replicated in new projects by the Brazilian
government (i.e. National Biodiversity Mainstreaming and Institutional Consolidation Project,
involving the Brazilian Environment Ministry, Caixa Econ6mica Federal and FUNBIO). At
the end of 2007, FUNBIO made an agreement with the state of Rio de Janeiro to develop a
state environmental compensation fund and to set up a program to support the State's
protected areas, which will be based on ARPA's experience

To support the Government of Brazil's efforts to achieve sustainable development of the
Amazon, the World Bank Group prepared the Amazon Partnership Framework (APF) as an
integral part of the CPS. The spirit of the APF is that it provides well-defined principles which
would govern the response of the Bank to requests for Bank partnership in this region. This
framework highlights the need to promote a balanced view between environmental1 social and
economic objectives. It also accentuates the importance of a balance between "command and
control" actions with those that provide positive incentives for sustainable activities.
The APF has two sets of objectives based on the Bank's experience and capacity and the
full objectives of the Government's Programa Amazonia Sustentavel (PAS).
At the national / global level the aims are to: i) stabilize Amazonia's contribution to nature
conservation and global environmental services; and ii) contribute to the national energy
grid, logistics corridors, and flow of other natural resources and goods within the context of
sustainable regional development.
At the Brazilian Amazon level the aims are to: i) increase access to basic services for the
population living in the Brazilian Amazon; ii) ensure employment and economic growth
through sustainable use of resources; and iii) improve participatory processes in planning and
implementation of large programs.
The engagement with the federal and state levels in pursuit of these objectives would be through
the following themes targeted through Bank operations and AAA work.14 The requests from
State Governments in the Amazon are growing and are likely to grow further as a result of the
articulation of the AFP. In all cases engagement with the states will follow the general rules for
Bank engagement. That is, the Bank will engage only when the proposed program is identified
in the State's Fiscal Adjustment Program (PAF). Indicative operations which might materialize
in this CPS period are described below:

14

For IFC's engagement with the private sector, see Annex 5.

Annex page 36

i) Substantial scaling-up of land administration focused activities through state level
projects (Pari Integrated Rural Development, Mato Grosso Natural Resources
Management) as well as through a federal level project (Amazonia Cadastre with
INCRA). In this area, the Amazonia Regional programmatic ESW series will build on the
Land Administration ESW (FY07) through investigation of options for implementation of
land regularization and cadastre and improved observance of legal reserve requirements.
ii) Increase emphasis on integration of mitigation and adaptation to climate change
through coverage in the Amazon Regional programmatic ESW and other narrower
ESW focused on climate change in Amazonia (e.g., payment for environmental services,
Amazonia dieback). Support the development of mechanisms to promote payments for
deforestation reduction and payments for environmental services.
iii) Increase conservation and protection of biodiversity and the protection of indigenous
communities at state and federal levels through the continuation of ARPA (GEF) beyond
the current first phase, expansion and/or consolidation of state protected areas as component
of sector wide state loans, and support at the federal level for FUNAI in strengthening the
management and protection of indigenous lands. These areas could benefit from any
mechanism to promote payments for deforestation reduction and payments for
environmental services.
iv) Promote sustainable use of natural resources through state level projects for improved
productive chains in forest (timber and non-timber resources) and fisheries management
(Para, Amazonas, Acre), for strengthening of the Forest Service and the forest concession
system in public forests, and for engagement with IFC of large-scale sustainable forest
management businesses (benchmark setting for environmental and social responsibility for
business in this area). These areas could also benefit from any mechanisms to promote
payments for deforestation reduction and payments for environmental services.
V)

Re-occupy degraded areas with sustainable agricultural, ranching and forestry
activities would be targeted first under the Amazon Regional programmatic ESW by
examining potential policies to promote changes in the official lending system for rural
development (such as Banco da Amazonia (BASA) and BNDES). ESW would also cover
ways to implement the provisions of the Forest Code for flexible implementation of legal
reserve requirements in formally zoned areas and through trading of reserve requirements
and private easements among landholders. Bank engagement would be primarily at the
state level, with IFC engaging few large-scale agribusinesses established behind the forest
frontier in areas already deforested, again aiming at setting benchmarks for environmental
and social responsibility. At the federal level, one aim will be to respond to a request from
the Ministry of Agriculture to support a program to promote the sustainable use of the
already deforested areas outside indigenous land and protected areas. This program would
take into account the different zoning exercises been done for the region, and any estimate
local/regional climate change.

vi) Improve Public Services for Human Development through state level projects.
Extreme dispersion of the rural population makes provision of social services and
infrastructure (roads, waterways and telecommunications) difficult and costly. In urban
areas, increased migration has caused a strong imbalance between demand and supply for
basic services. Thus, state projects in the Amazon would tend to adopt an integrated
approach to human development, quality of life and environmental sustainability (e.g.,
Annex page 37

Acre, and Alto Solimaes in Amazonas). Components should include health, education,
sanitation and social protection.
vii) Support Balanced Infrastructure Development, Infrastructure services such as access to
energy, roads maintenance, improvement of waterways safety, and product storage capacity
are essential to reach new enterprises and attract investments which lead to adding value to
production and increasing job opportunities. The Government is applying a new approach
in the region around the BR-163 highway to ensure that any planned infrastructure also
considers environmental and social sustainability. The Bank is engaged in this process
through the PPG7 but would seek to deepen its engagement through federal (MAPA) and
state (Mato Grosso and Para) projects aimed at more organized regional development of
infrastructure and related economic activities. Support through TA would aim to integrate
states' regional development, environmental management, and public infrastructure
strategies through economic-ecological zoning and appropriate economic incentives and
regulatory instruments. If assessments done through this TA process demonstrate that
particular infra-structure projects make sense in terms of economics, finance, governance,
and environment and social impact, the Bank could engage. IBRD financing might focus
on governance, institutional strengthening, and environmental, social and regional
development, while IFC and MIGA might support the private project developers.
In all cases where the Bank has engaged (for example in the approved projects for the states of
Amapa, Para and Amazonas) or is engaging (for example the Acre project) the governments
have promoted communication with and participation by stakeholders and information
dissemination and disclosure.
Finally, the challenges of reconciling development and conservation are a similar challenge in
Brazil's other great biomes, including the Pantanal and Cerrado. The principles of Bank
engagement in the Amazon will also apply to Bank engagement in these other biomes.

Brazil's Private Sector Strategy (PSS) supports the three main pillar of the CPS as illustrated
above. They notably include IFC's corporate objective of promoting sustainability (E&S,
Corporate Governance), investing in health and education, and renewable energies, as well as
seeking to address climate change issues. As highlighted in Annex 3, the WBG PSS also
supports public sector management at the municipal level via business simplification.
This PSS draws upon the recommendations from the report entitled "Strengthening the World
Bank's Engagement with IBRD Partner Countries", and discussed at the Development
Committee Meeting in September 2006 (Report SecM2006-035411). This annex will focus on
the details of the IFC program, as details of the joint World Bank Group approach are discussed
in Annex 3.
IFC Strategy and Priorities in Brazil:
The IFC aims to differentiate itself in the market and to maximize its development impact by
combining investment and advisory services activities. The strategy has several key elements:
Access to Finance and Capital Markets Development: reach microentrepreneurs, small
businesses, and second-tier companies and provide long-term financing for corporations
through investments in medium sized banks, microfinance, and other vehicles designed to
increase credit availability to individuals (mortgages, consumer finance), and to middle
market companies.
In other sectors such as extractive industries, information and technology IFC will have a
more selective as well as a more opportunistic approach. There will be a priority for
investments promoting renewable energies and energy efficiency, in addition to best
practices in corporate governance and environmental and safeguard ( E M ) standards.
Strengthen Infrastructure and Logistics, including Health and Education by increasing
private sector participation, via investments, local currency financing, and advisory services
(with the Federal Government of Brazil under the PPP facility financed by both IFC and IDB
with IBRD support).

Contribute to the sustainable development of the Brazilian Amazon region: Following its
investments in Arnaggi (soy plantations) and in Bertin (meat packing). IFC has an
opportunity through a combination of investments and advisory services to try to go beyond
one-off investments and have an impact on a sector wide basis.
Promote sustainability through higher standards for corporate governance and
environmental and social performance.

o Support Brazilian private companies' aspiration to become global market players facilitating their investments in other merging markets, including IDA countries, promoting
sustainability and meeting the global-climate change challenge.

IFC's strategy is a function of the current environment in Brazil of relatively strong growth and
still reasonable liquidity in capital markets. Should the world economic environment worsen and
liquidity for Brazilian companies dry up, the Corporation can play a countercyclical role, such as
lending to Tier I companies in times of crisis (e.g reactivation of trade lines in 2003).
World Bank Group Value added

Middle Income Countries (MICs) stress the need for stronger support from Multilateral
Development Banks (MDBs) for improving the business environment; the importance of MDB
fbnding mechanisms for the private sector and of public-private partnerships in infrastructure
financing as a mechanism to promote private investment; and a need to enhance the private
sector's awareness of products offered by the MDBs.
The private sector plays a central role in the development of MIC's such as Brazil, in driving
growth and job creation, as well as reducing poverty. Enabling the private sector requires the
combined efforts of governments and private actors. Thus it is increasingly important for the
IBRD, IFC and MIGA, to work closely in supporting Brazil's development.
Focus on Cooperation. WBG support for private sector development focuses on two tasks.
Governments need to ensure a sound investment and regulatory environment that includes good
governance and provides physical and social infrastructure. There is a growing role for
governments and the private sector to work together in public-private partnerships in
infrastructure and delivery of public services. While IBRD concentrates on the first task and
IFC/MIGA on the second, the WBG will work together to enhance the effectiveness of the
overall support to Brazil's development. IFC's and MIGAYsknowledge of the private sector,
and of foreign investors is already informing IBRD for improving the private sector
environment, and is an essential component of WBG country partnership strategies. Over this
CPS period, greater integration of WBG country support is expected to translate into more
effective WBG cooperation at the project and global program levels.

IBRD Value Added - IBRDYsstrategy with respect to the private sector development focuses
on improving competitiveness and the investment climate, both at the national and at the state
levels (See Annex 3) with the ultimate objective of improve the country's growth performance.
Annex page 40

IFC Value Added - IFC's mandate is to foster private sector development that reduces poverty
and improves people's lives. This is accomplished through investment and advisory services.
Advisory services complement IFC investments. There exist a large number of economic
sectors, particularly in frontier countries in Latin America, but also in MICs such as Brazil with
frontier regions (part of the Brazilian Legal Amazon and the Northeast regions), that do not
qualify for investment due to a lack of size, sector sophistication, and/or potential for significant
return. These sectors and their associated Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) can
play an important role in reducing poverty. Supporting these sectors extends IFC's reach and
credibility, focuses on the settings which best facilitate MSME growth and health, strengthens
certain sectors for future IFC investment, and promotes equitable economic growth,
competitiveness and sustainability.
IFC's Value Proposition - IFC's value proposition is its worldwide network, sectoral
knowledge and IFC's Performance Standards. As NGOs and other civil society representatives
focus on challenging projects such as in the Brazilian Amazon, IFC's experience in dealing with
environmental and social issues (Amaggi, Bertin) becomes more relevant and complements a
company's efforts.

Our Value Proposition: Sustainable Development

1.

Access to finance and capital market development

A healthy and dynamic financial sector, which can efficiently mobilize savings and provide
resources for entrepreneurs, is critical to investors and, therefore, to growth and competitiveness.
Since 2001, IFC has helped to raise approximately US$1.6 billion of funding for the Brazilian
financial sector in various plain vanilla and structured credit formats. However, most of these
funds have been raised on behalf of the country's large universal banks. During the past two
fiscal years, and in light of the evolution of the Brazilian financial sector where Tier I banks have
been assuming a more sustainable position IFC has been shifting its focus more to mid size or
Tier I1 Brazilian banks.

Annex page 4 1

The Brazilian Banking Sector - Since the end of market volatility coinciding with the country's
Presidential elections in 2002, Brazil's financial sector performance has been positive. This is
largely a consequence of the recovery in the local economy and increased domestic demand,
continued expansion of exports and agribusiness, and the strategy of the principal financial sector
conglomerates to compensate for declines in spreads by adding scale and increasing their share
of niche loan markets. In this environment, loan growth and recurrent banking business - rather
than trading gains - have increasingly become the primary drivers of bank revenues. Moreover,
the banking system's loan portfolio quality ratios have benefited from improved macroeconomic
conditions. Furthermore, there have been several advances in banking sector infrastructure as
well as Central Bank supervision, all of which have reduced systemic vulnerabilities.
In spite of the sector's relatively positive outlook, several obstacles to effective financial
intermediation continue to persist, including: directed lending schemes, large state-owned banks,
high reserve requirements (which remain essential for monetary policy, but immobilize bank
capital without remuneration), financial taxes, and relatively low operating efficiency indicators
for the banking segment as a whole. By international standards, the Brazilian banking sector is
characterized by very high intermediation spreads and high operational costs.

-

Mid-sized Banks Brazilian mid-sized banks have become an IFC priority in Brazil. They
represent a considerable business opportunity for IFC, with an aggregate asset size of US$40
billion-equivalent - larger than the financial sectors of many Latin American countries.
Furthermore, transactions with these banks usually have high development impact, since midsized banks:
(i) play a key role in making credit available to smaller and mid-sized corporates, who are
typically underserved by larger banks and the capital markets;
(ii) help to promote competition in the Brazilian banking sector - which is dominated by large
public as well as private-sector entities; and
(iii) face handicaps compared to larger banks in terms of availability, stability, tenor, and pricing
of local currency funding.
IFC's approach towards the mid-sized bank segment started with the Global Trade Finance
Program (GTFP) developed in FY06. Once IFC became more familiar with this market segment,
the strategy evolved to providing selected long-term funding to the well-run banks. The next
step was to consider equity investments, the first one being Banco Fibra. Equity-oriented
structures play an important role in the overall IFC strategy, since they help to address the
anticipated capital needs of mid-sized banks expanding their credit businesses. Furthermore,
equity-oriented transactions help to enhance the overall return for IFC from its aggregate
financial exposure to mid-sized Brazilian banks, given the underlying profitability of well-run
entities in this segment.
Since FY05, IFC has developed relationships with 14 mid-sized banks. As of February 29,2008,
IFC had outstanding loanslguarantees issued with 11 of them: (i) US$172 million of guarantees
issued for 7 banks under the GTFP (BIC, Banco Comercial, BPN Brasil, Daycoval, Indusval,
Pine and Sofisa), with approximately US$344 million in issuance since the beginning of the
program in FY06; (ii) US$300 million equivalent in local currency format disbursed to banks
f~cusiagon SME lending (BBM, BIC, Fibra, Daycoval, Sofisa, and Tribanco); (iii) US$400
million raised in B loans (Fibra, Daycoval, and Sofisa); (iv) US$15 million equivalent in local
currency format to support construction finance (Brascan); and (v) US$20 million in equity in
Banco Fibra.
Annex page 42

Brazil's Capital Markets
Until recently, Brazil's capital markets were not particularly active. In 2002, average daily
trading on BOVESPA was worth R$558 million, the equivalent at the time of just US$198
million. Since then, there have been significant developments. By 2006, average daily trading
rose to R$2.4 billion (US$1.1 billion). In October 2007, it was R$6.7 billion (US$3.7 billion).
BOVESPA's initial public offering on October 26, 2007, placed the Siio Paulo stock exchange
among the top world capital markets. The main factors behind this rapid growth include: a high
level of global liquidity, raising commodity prices, and the expectation that Brazil would reach
investment grade (and which occurred at the end of April, 2008).
Another crucial element is the fundamental change in attitudes to corporate governance which
started with the Novo Mercado created by BOVESPA in 2001 with IFC support. Traditionally,
Brazilian companies did not favor becoming public companies, and minority shareholders rights
were very limited. In the late 1990s, the Brazilian Congress enacted a law giving a modicum of
protection to minority shareholders in the event of a change of control within a company. The
Novo Mercado is a voluntary listings segment demanding much higher standards of governance
than legally required, and two other, less demanding segments, known as Level 1 and Level 2.
IFC supported the entrance of several of its clients into the Novo Mercado, including advisory
services to assist clients move to the next levels of corporate governance.

After a slow start, and with the expansion of global liquidity in the past few years, the Novo
Mercado grew significantly. The 157 companies which, by the end of February 2008, were
listed at Level 1, Level 2 and Novo Mercado represented 56% of BOVESPA's total market
capitalization, 68% of the trading value and 75% of the number of trades in the cash market. All
the members of the IFC-sponsored Companies Circle of well-governed Latin companies are
Novo Mercado-listed. At the celebration of the looth listing on Novo Mercado this past March,
IFC was one of only four institutional investors that BOVESPA presented with an award for
consistent support of this successful initiative.

Another significant step in Brazilian capital market was the creation of the Sustainability Index.
In 2005 and 2006, IFC, through its Sustainable Finance Facility, provided financial support to
the Center for Sustainability Studies at the Getulio Vargas Foundation to develop on the S2o
Paulo Stock Exchange's behalf the first Corporate Sustainability Index in Latin America. The
Index tracks not only the economic and financial performance of companies, but also their
Annex page 43

corporate governance and environmental and social performance. IFC's initiative aimed at
encouraging companies to adopt sustainable practices and providing investors with a tool to
monitor those companies.
Expected to serve as a model in developing countries, the Sustainability Index was launched in
December 2005, listing 28 local companies. In December 2006, during its second edition, 40
companies were listed. The Index had appreciated 37.82 percent versus 32.93 percent from the
BOVESPA standard index.
Housing finance - IFC's housing finance strategy has been supporting the positive housing
finance sector trends of the past few years, thereby building momentum for Brazil to overcome
the remaining development challenges that still confront this important segment of the economy.
Brazil is still characterized by a large housing deficit - estimated at 7.9 million homes in 2004.
Approximately 92 percent of the total housing deficit is concentrated in lower-income segments.
Geographically, the urban areas located in the Southeast region of Brazil (including Sao Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro) contain the highest residential shortages followed by urban and rural
shortages in the poorer Northeast region. IFC's action, reinforced by the Bank's program, has
built on the institutional insights and transaction experience gained over the last 3 years in
closing its initial equity and debt projects in the sector, which have involved a total financing of
US$60 million equivalent that was mad available to two housing finance securitization firms, as
well as one smaller bank already active in providing construction finance.

IFC financial sector and capital market strategy - IFC's objective is to reach
microentrepreneurs, small businesses, and second-tier companies and provide long-term
financing for corporations through investments in medium sized banks, microfinance, and other
vehicles designed to increase credit availability to individuals (mortgages, consumer finance),
and to middle market companies. IFC proposes the following four strategic priority areas:
Financial (both credit and equity) as well as TA support for medium-sued banks. To the
greatest extent possible, local currency-denominated transactional structures will be used by
IFC to mobilize credit for mid-sized banks, given the largely domestic orientations of their
business.
Financings which involve the country's increasingly dynamic securitization-oriented
firms, and/or securitization transactionslfacilities as well as wholesale-oriented credit
programs managed by banks - particularly in priority segmentdareas like housing finance,
SME lending, and capital markets development. These entities and/or transactional
structures are playing an important role in building up Brazil's asset-backed securitization
markets. Moreover, business in these segments is often focused on priority sectors for IFC.
Case-by-case transactions with Brazil's larger banks - usually focused on sustainabilityrelated initiatives and capital markets-oriented transactions that can efficiently mobilize
funding for SMEs.

2.

Tier I1 Companies - particularly General Manufacturing, Agribusiness

As top tier companies gain better access to finance, they have less need for IFC financing except
where there is compelling IFC additionality for non-financial reasons (e.g., Environment and
Sustainability (E&S) or Corporate Governance).
Annex page 44

In Brazil, IFC is increasingly focusing on second tier companies who cannot access financing
with longer tenors, particularly in Manufacturing and Agribusiness. In many cases, these
companies are considering investments in other countries so there may be a South-South role for
IFC or they are preparing for an IPO so IFC can help them with corporate governance issues,
facilitating their transition from a family owned to a publicly traded company. IFC is developing
long term relationships with second tier companies. In other sectors such as extractive
industries, information and technology IFC will have a more selective and a more opportunistic
approach
General manufacturing and agribusiness are leading growth sectors in Brazil. They have a high
impact on income generating activities. Leading companies in these sectors multiply their
impact down the value chain, notably via local suppliers. IFC's intervention includes advisory
services in renewable energy, energy efficiency, corporate governance and E&S standards.
Promoting renewable energy. IFC has made a strategic commitment to support the
development of renewable and sustainable energy in its markets. In terms of direct investments
in renewable energy projects, IFC focuses its business development efforts in those countries
which provide a fertile ground for private sector involvement in this field, and in those segments
of the renewable energy market which are the most competitive. In this context, Brazil is an
important market for IFC, and modem cogeneration of electricity and steam through sugarcanebased biomass holds a key place in this market. IFC is also implementing its commitment to
renewable energy by promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency in manufacturing and
agribusiness projects.

General Manufacturing - example of a mapping exercise In the past two years IFC
conducted an extensive mapping exercise of the Brazilian general manufacturing sector. Our
seetor coverage included:

In addition, IFC addresses the MSME sector through funding to medium sized banks which onlend to these smaller companies.
The analysis identified leading Tier I1 companies in several subsectors. The strategy involves a
focus on second-tier companies with potential to become market leaders in fast-growing
Annex page 46

sectors. Target companies with the following aspects were identified: (i) Considering
investment in other emerging market countries; (ii) Preparing for an IPO , in which IFC can play
a role in elevating Corporate Governance standards; (iii) Interested in developing a long-term
relationship in support of growth. This work was facilitated via the decentralization process with
a general manufacturing team based in Sao Paulo. Currently we have an active pipeline which
should allow us to make several commitments in this sector.
Agribusiness - Agribusiness plays a major role in Brazil's economic growth, and the country is a
major supplier of agricultural products to the international market. This sector has significant
impacts in terms of employment generation and infrastructure development in rural areas.
Furthermore, agriculture has an impact on the environment, and managing of environmental
impacts is fundamental for all stakeholders. Most local companies, especially Tier I1 companies,
dedicated to agriculture have limited access to long-term financing, and are in need of advisory
services for among others best practices in E&S, energy efficiency, corporate governance. As in
general manufacturing, IFC conducted a mapping exercise to identify the best agribusiness
companies able to generate sustainable growth.

The Corporation will provide its range of services to:
support the development of sub-sectors where Brazil has a competitive advantage - sugar,
oilseeds, cotton, animal proteins;
support the emergence of sustainable models of production to address challenges of
agriculture development and environmental sustainability;
support the emergence of regional players through management training, corporate
governance and business transparency support, and best practice E&S standards.
Within the agricultural sector, the sugar and ethanol subsector is another strong economic driver,
and none but a few large leading companies readily attract financing. Brazil's sugar and ethanol
sector accounts for about one million direct jobs, and provides a market for 60,000 farmers who
supply sugar cane.
Extractive Industries - This area includes the chemical, oil and gas, and mining sectors.
Traditionally IFC was quite active in the chemicals industry in Brazil and supported its
consolidation in FY03-FY07. As of June 30, 2006, IFC had financed 30 transactions. IFC's
early investments helped to establish some of Brazil's first petrochemical complexes promoted
under the three-way ownership scheme (state, private local group, foreign multinational). Today,
one of the big challenges is for these companies to get their ownership restructured and position
themselves in the industry's consolidation, aiming at achieving economies of scale locally and
continue expansion abroad through acquisitions. During this CPS period, The IFC does not
expect to be very active in this sector, and will be mainly looking at chemical companies
expanding into other emerging markets.
In Oil and Gas, IFC will: (i) select those projects that strengthen local players through early
stage equity investment and financing; (ii) add value preparing companies for listing - Corporate
Governance, Stamp of approval, E&S, insurance; (iii) explore local financing facility for small
local players; (iv) maintain Petrobras relationship focusing on their overseas activities (LAC,
Africa, ME).
Mining - This is an area where we will invest on a very selective basis: (i) Early stage equity
(given high commodity cycle, valuation more attractive at early stage), focus on equity play

Annex page 47

while continue to providing financing; (ii) junior mining companies where IFC brings valueadded in E&S and Corporate Governance; (iii) well established projects/companies where IFC
can assist the company with a social strategy. Our value-added is in E&S expertise and technical
assistance on linkages, improving relationship with stakeholders and mitigating anti-mining
issues, and IFC stamp of approval.

3.

Infrastructure and logistics; Health and Education

Businesses perform better if their transactions costs are minimized through access to adequate
technology, developed telecommunications systems, efficient energy supply, and highperformance transportation services.
Access to health and education improves labor
productivity, and the economy's prospects for innovation. Improving infrastructure continues to
be at the top of the policy agenda of Brazil.
The poor transport infrastructure is a major bottleneck in Brazil and the lack of power investment
could potentially lead to energy shortages over the medium term (depending on rainfall patterns,
strength of economic growth, etc). IFC advisory services has been working with the Federal
Government of Brazil on its PPP program in infrastructure while at the same time IFC has made
selected infrastructure investments. IFC's recent ability to do long term local currency financing
will likely be an important tool in increasing our ability to make infrastructure investments in
Brazil. Our activities will cover transport and logistics, water and sanitation, health and
education, and electricity. We will place an emphasis on:
Addressing logistical growth constraints - power, ports, roads, rail
Building long term partnerships - companies consolidating, going regionallglobal
Adding value through sustainability - carbon finance, energy efficiency, renewables

Furthermore, we will allocate resources towards Frontier and Systemic Efforts:
Frontier areas in Brazil - Amazon, Northeast
a
Urban and rural poor - access to basic services, notably power distribution
a
Systemic efforts - PPPs (project advisory - BNDES PPP facility), Proinfa (legal review
- project support
Health and Education, IFC's main objective has been to support private sector investment for a
more equitable and competitive Brazil. Facilitating private sector investments in those sectors
will involve:

Focus on strategic clients, which include relatively large providers with a potential to
increase access in underserved areas, and capable of spreading best practices and raising
industry standards.
Better serve smaller domestic clients - mainly mid-sized local players, with growth
potential, and willing to improve governance and management.
Expand wholesale approach and local currency financing.
Provide project and sector support through advisory services: cooperate with government
authorities and the WB to support the introduction of PPPs in the delivery of social
services, improve the environment for private providers and performing studies that
facilitate the introduction of new products and disseminate best practices.

Annex page 48

In education, one recent project example, supporting a Tier I Bank credit line in Brazil,
highlighted the following objectives:
to improve social welfnre and equity by increasing access to post-secondary education
to students who cannot afford full tuition out-of-pocket: The World Bank has supported
various primary and secondary education projects in Brazil designed to narrow the equity
divide. IFC plays a complimentary role to the World Bank by supporting projects
designed to enhance access of lower and middle-income students to private universities.
the development local capital markets tltrouglt future sales of repackaged student loans
to investors, creating a new asset class in the process: The creation of a new asset class
will help drive potential investors into a growing and competitive education market.
These new investment opportunities could help lessen the pressure placed on the
Brazilian Government to extend resources beyond its commitments in primary and
secondary education and attract private sector involvement to the growing post-secondary
education market.
Release working capital of Participating Universities (many of which are SME's) that
are currently funding their independent (and often inefficient) student financing programs
and thus offer an alternative funding source for SME's in Brazil. A project recently
approved by the Board is expected to help universities release working capital and
transfer much needed funds currently devoted to independent student financing programs
towards expansion of university programs. Additional funds would give private
universities the opportunity to invest in curriculum development, infrastructure, and
postgraduate programs among other possibilities.
IFC hopes to replicate project which are successful in leveraging local capital markets to
improve the delivery of social services.

Tlte Electricity Sector - Financing for the Brazilian electricity sector is a key issue. BNDES is
practically the only source of long-term financing for new assets (generation plants and
transmission lines). Other development agencies, including Eletrobras, finance up to 75 percent
of total Project costs and the financing is limited to investments related to new customer
connections. The Amazon Region Development Agency ("SUDAM") and the Northeast Region
Development Agency ("SUDENE") are federal programs which provide limited financing to
selected projects and to companies located in the less developed Amazon and Northeast regions
of the country to support economic development in their region. Local bond issuances and
commercial bank loans to electricity sector companies have been limited to 5-6 years.
The GOB has asked for WBG's support of infrastructure in Brazil to meet the objectives of the
Program to Accelerate Growth ("PAC") which estimates that US$145 billion are required for
new investments in the electricity sector in the next four years. IFC's additionality derives from
its ability to provide long-term local currency financing (with a longer grace period) and a
"stamp of approval" that will improve a company's future access to financing at better market
conditions and will enhance the Company's market image.

IFC's investments in Brazil's power sector. IFC has been playing an important role in
supporting Brazil's electricity sector, specifically: (a) for the expansion and modernization of the
sector by supporting projects that require long-term funds and high investment volumes; (b) for
improvements in the distribution network; and (c) for renewable energy. IFC's investments in
Brazil's power sector are summarized below.

IFC's strategy in Brazil's power sector - IFC will be selective in its investments and will focus
on:
(a) the development of hydroelectric power plants on a corporate or project finance basis, by
complementing BNDES financing (i.e. items not eligible for BNDES financing);
(b) the repowering of existing hydroelectric power plants to improve their efficiency as well as
to create additional capacity;
(c) if the fuel is available and secured, to support gas fired power plants;
(d) to support concessions of transmission lines;
(e) to support distribution companies with local financing (via the Real-linked loan or a partial
credit guarantee) for the expansion and improvement of their distribution network; and
(f) to support companies that are developing renewable energy projects, e.g. groups of small
hydros (PCHs), wind, biomass.
Advisory Services - IFC has number of active advisory mandates in support of infrastructure.
Some will be implemented in this upcoming CPS period, while future ones are currently in
progress. IFC has been active in helping the federal government strengthen the credibility of the
PPPs, including through ongoing advisory on structuring the BR 1161324 roads in the state of
Bahia and an irrigation PPP (Pontal) located in the northeast of Brazil. In addition, IFC has
created a JV with BNDES and IADB to support PPPs at federal, state and municipal levels.
Several PPP projects have been already identified at state levels, mainly in Bahia and Brasilia.
Sub-National Finance (CSF) - A joint IBRDAFC department, an additional product for
infrastructure financing
CSF, a joint World BankJIFC department operating on IFC's balance sheet and drawing on the
combined credit and structuring skills of IFC and the public sector skills of IBRD staff, offers to
creditworthy sub-national entities the same range of financial and advisory services traditionally
available to IFC's private-sector clients. Because IFC is prohibited by its Articles to seek or
accept sovereign guarantees, CSF investments are subject to rigorous credit appraisal and
supervision. Since its creation in October 2006, CSF has processed three new operations in
Russia, South Africa and the Philippines and assumed a portfolio of seven operations in South
Africa, Mexico, China and Guatemala that had been developed under IFC's former Municipal
Fund. These operations (mainly partial guarantees) have helped well-run sub-national entities to
Annex page 50

mobilize financing for critical infrastructure investments at improved terms and maturities, in
local currency and without sovereign support.
We expect that CSF's engagement will be limited in size and will be focused exclusively on
Non-Dependent Entities ('NDEs"). "NDEs" are legally defined in Brazil as public enterprises
that are financially self-reliant and do not receive operating subsidies from federal, state or
municipal budgets. These include the more viable State-owned (and possibly Federal) utility
enterprises in revenue-earning sectors, such as water, power or gas distribution; and a few PPP
project or vehicle companies that are not dependent on the state budgets.
CSF has received indications of interest from several well-run and commercially viable Stateowned power and water utilities that have considerable investment needs. Operations with these
enterprises could include direct loans where appropriate, generally in local currency. Partial
guarantees or mezzanine instruments could be used to enable these enterprises to improve the
terms or tenors of their debt (or of quasi-debt instruments such as receivable funds/FIDC).
Where feasible, CSF would aim to co-invest or share risk with financial intermediaries, to help
develop the market and achieve a broader impact on service coverage with its limited
investment.
Some State-level utilities, while remaining under Government control, may wish to follow the
examples of Sabesp, Cemig or Copasa and improve their commercial orientation as well as their
balance sheet by opening their capital to minority private participation, generally through IPO.
Small IFC equity investments, combined with advisory support on corporate governance, could
help ensure the success of such listings.
Helping Improve the Business Environment

Brazil has made progress in improving the business environment. Policy reforms are being
implemented to improve institutions and governance, to reduce the cost of doing business, and to
promote private sector activity. However, there are still many remaining hurdles for investors.
The process of starting a new business should be made as free as possible from legal and
administrative impediments. The markets for factors, goods and services needs be more
efficient. For instance, rigid labor market regulations are often associated with unemployment
and low productivity. The legal framework for property rights and commercial laws could be
strengthened, notably in regions such as the Amazon. Investors prefer to invest where property
rights are well defined and fully enforced, since investment returns are then more secure.
IFC is helping the city of SBo Paulo simplify its business registration, licensing and construction
permit issuance processes through TA to this important municipality. This Business Enabling
Environment work is being rolled out in several states in the less prosperous northeast of Brazil,
working closely with the World Bank and FIAS. The program is a joint effort between FIAS and
the IFC Office for Advisory Services in LAC. This collaboration allows both World Bank Group
organizations to better leverage existing products and expand the areas of work seeking to
deliver a coherent package of assistance to improve the business environment notably in the NE
of Brazil.
The program brings together multiple projects into a package of assistance. It combines
benchmarking efforts with implementation of reforms as well as the development of a new
regulatory governance process. The primary clients are sub-national governments, particularly
in NE Brazil, md the program is being carried out with the participation of both the private and
Annex page 5 1

public sectors to build local capacities, install monitoring and evaluation systems and form a
constituency for reform in participating states and municipalities. There is already a high level
of commitment for this program from both clients and donor organizations that would like to
leverage current World Bank Group initiatives to improve the business environment in the
country.
5.

Promoting Sustainability

IFC has been promoting adoption of better Corporate Governance and Sustainability (CG&S)
standards practices through:
working with BOVESPA, the stock exchange in Sao Paulo;
helping sponsor the creation of the Novo Mercado listing on the BOVESPA;
supporting and funding the creation of the Brazilian Sustainability Index or;
promoting sustainable investment through sustainability credit lines to ABN AMRO
Banco Real with proceeds to be on lent to middle market companies willing to improve
their corporate governance, etc.
IFC's Equator Principles are becoming widely adopted by financial institutions - 41
banks have adopted the Equator Principles as of June 2006, accounting for 80 percent of
global project lending .. ."
Sustainability is central to the IFC Mission. It is a cross cutting theme in this PSS as evidenced
in the sections above, in our Amazon focus (see below), and promoting Brazilian enterprise as
leaders in sustainable practices (section below). IFC's intervention will involve:

1) Creating market-based incentives for companies to improve their corporate governance and
overall sustainability standards (e.g. Novo Mercado, ISE, BOVESPA's Access Market - a new
segment for smaller companies to adhere to better corporate governance practices, OECD's
Latin American Roundtable and Companies Circle).
2) Helping the private sector to better manage E&S issues (e.g. Equator Principles,
Sustainability Credit Lines, Round Table on Responsible Soy, Biodiversity & Agricultural
Commodities Program - supporting Sustainability Roundtables by providing sector-wide
advisory services in E&S issues)
3) Helping the private sector to incorporate sustainability practices in the business valuechain. Examples include:
Bertin TAAS - supporting the sustainable value chain of cattle ranching and other small
scale agricultural activities in the Amazon (to be implemented)
Tribanco TAAS - incorporating sustainability practices into Martins SME retail valuechain (conscious consumption of money and credit, corporate social responsibility and
business sustainability)
Bauducco TAAS - cleaner production audit aiming to implement energy efficiency
practices in industrial operations

A Comprehensive approach to the Amazon

Brazil faces complex trade-offs between promoting agribusiness and other types of economic
development in the Amazon and, on the other hand, preventing de-forestation and the resulting
Annex page 52

greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity. IFC has over the years made several
investments in companies operating in the Amazon, most recently the soy producer Amaggi and
the meatpacker Bertin. While these individual investments may have a positive impact in the
area they operate and even create a demonstration effect, a more effective way for IFC to have a
major impact on the Amazon is through a programmatic approach. Any program must include a
package of investments and complementary advisory services which would allow the IFC to
work on a sector-wide basis in key sectors such as agribusiness and forestry, and possibly
infrastructure and mining.
The Amazon, an important climate regulator for Brazil and for the planet, is in danger.
Deforestation and burning in the Amazon produces 75 percent of the total greenhouse emissions
in Brazil. Deforestation has reached 18 percent of the Amazon forested area, and occurs because
of a complex mixture of lawlessness, lack of land titling, poverty, road construction, logging,
pressure from cattle ranching, soy and other agriculture and other factors. These issues make
working in the Amazon particularly challenging and complex.
IFC is proposing a specific program to support sustainability driven private sector investments in
the Brazilian Amazon. The core objectives of the IFC Brazilian Amazon Initiative are:
to develop market based incentives for the conservation of the Amazon;
(i)
to contribute to reduced deforestation and biodiversity conservation;
(ii)
(iii) to address poverty alleviation by promoting sustainable value chain business linkages
and strengthening stakeholders engagement.
These objectives are consistent with the Government of Brazil Sustainable Amazon Plan, and are
an integral part of the WBG Amazon Partnership Framework.
IFC will work in the Amazon using a combination of advisory services and investments. Key
investment opportunities are likely to be in the areas of agribusiness, forestry, access to finance,
and to a lesser degree manufacturing and biodiversity related products. Potential business
opportunities may result in 3 to 4 projects for an expected investment amount of US$30-60
million. There will be a dedicated core team of advisory services with adequate resources to
support the industry departments' investment teams to meet the sectoral and cross-sectoral
challenges of working in the Amazon.
IFC intervention will involve the following 3 main pillars:
(i) sustainable management and use of forested areas, including sustainably managed
production of forests (timber and NTFPs products), as well as management of private
reserves and conservation areas;
(ii) sustainable and intensive use of already deforested areas (particularly those that are
currently abandoned and underutilized), mainly in agribusiness and planted forests;
(iii)poverty alleviation and forest conservation, with a major focus on sustainable financing
and access to finance, supply-chain income generation business linkages, stakeholders
engagement and improving the business environment.
Some of the expected outcomes are: (i) increase in the number of industry sectors and financial
institutions that adopt sustainable business practices in the Amazon; (ii) to incorporate a greater
number of local communities and MSMEs in the value chain of sustainable Amazon businesses;
(iii) increase in the demand and supply of Amazon "sustainable products"; (iv) reduced pressure
on deforestation; (v) increase in forest conservation.

Supporting Brazilian Private Companies' Aspiration to become Global Players Sustainability, Climate Change, Investing in IDA Countries

As a middle-income country Brazil is a leading example of a country and its private sector
aspiring to global leadership in world markets. Several Brazilian Companies have become world
leaders in their business. Some with IFC support have invested in other emerging markets,
including IDA countries (e.g. CVRD in Mozambique, Odebrecht in Angola, Marcopolo in
Mexico). Brazil is playing a growing role in relation to global challenges (AIDS, climate
change, biodiversity, clean energy). The WBG has been active in supporting Brazilian private
sector development in those areas, promoting sustainability standards, via financing and advisory
services.
Brazil is a leading example of a country with a clean energy matrix which has moved toward
energy independence through the expansion of alternative energy sources such as
hydroelectricity, ethanol and biodiesel. The private sector has shown unique leadership in
ethanol, a cleaner and renewable agro-energy source that could become an important
complementary energy source, especially if trade barriers in developed economies are removed
and a global market arises. Brazilian technology for sugar canelethanol production is being
transferred to other developing countries. Supporting the Brazilian private sector in these efforts
will help address climate change challenges.

ANNEX6: CPS CONSULTATIONS
In agreement with the Brazilian Government, the Brazil country team undertook consultations
for the preparation of this CPS with governors and state secretaries of numerous states,
academics, private sector, civil society representatives, members of the international community,
members of Congress and youth organizations. These meetings took place between 2007 and
2008 in Brasilia, Manaus, Recife, and S5o Paulo. The consultations were divided into three main
rounds, involving more than a hundred individuals.
The purpose of the consultations was to stimulate discussion and the exchange of ideas around the
Bank's proposed strategy in Brazil, and help define a broader and clearer view of Brazil's
development perspectives, especially as associated with the paradigmatic challenges referred to in
the CPS. The recommendations generated during the consultation process have been compiled and
taken into consideration during the CPS process.
Participants were asked to evaluate and discuss the Bank Group's role and its potential role in
key areas linked to Brazil's top development challenges, including: strengthening the public
sector, private sector development; infrastructure; human development; agriculture and natural
resource management; development and conservation in major biomes; and innovation, science
and technology. Views on increased direct engagement with municipalities were also discussed
with several audiences.
The participants endorsed the overall proposal for the Country Partnership Strategy and lauded the
World Bank on the participatory nature and transparency of the CPS preparation. Likewise,
participants lauded the strong relationship with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in the
activities outlined in the CPS process. Consensus was reached that the World Bank should put
emphasis on the a) "how to", as opposed to "what to"; b) new financial products, including
competitive interest rates, guarantees and insurance products; c) a more ambitious and selective
program; d) focus on major development challenges; e) and focus on results.
Recommendations suggested the need to tailor solutions to the diverse contexts in Brazil, and
added regional multi-sector development as a new challenge to consider. Some participants
proposed that the WBG be opportunistic, quick and flexible in the response to demands. To this
end, participants stressed the need for more horizontal, multi sector approaches, as opposed to
sector approaches, while clarifying the links between different challenges.
Recommendations also suggested that the CPS be clearer about the capacity of the WBG to
leverage and act as memorylguardian for continuity in long-term policies and programs as well as
to provide a clearer description on how social safeguards are applied on WBG related projects and
programs.
There were strong commonalities of messages among different groups consulted, but also
systematic differences. On the goals for Brazil's development, there was a great deal of
convergence and endorsement of the directions of the CPS. The differences emerged more when
it comes to the means and actions required to achieve Brazil's development goals.
In sum, the continued perspective of a more equitable, sustainable and competitive Brazil was
well received during the consultations, an important reconfirmation of the goals of the previous
CPS period.
Annex page 55

A summary of the comments received during the CPS consultation meetings, which-complement
the ongoing process of Bank staff discussions and consultations with inside and outside of
Government follows. The comments below should not be interpreted as a comprehensive or
official representation of any groups or views. Their reproduction does not imply an endorsement
by the World Bank.

NorthIAmazon Region Authorities and Private Sector
Suggested areas for improvement and better definition:
o Regional multi-sector development as a new challenge to consider;
o Better integration of:
o Knowledge, institutional building, planning and management, and financing;
o Economic, social development and sustainability; and
o Public and private sectors.
Several participants suggested that the Bank be opportunistic, quick and flexible in the response
to demands.
Private sector development
o
Focus on small and medium enterprises, not only on large companies;
Better partnership between IFC and Banco da Amazonia, i.e in the development of
o
micro credit, a la "credit0 amigo" in the NE;
Some concern about the Bertin project, but relief that IFC is in;
o
Common market in the Amazon Region, including the neighboring countries;
a
Enhancement of Manaus industrial pole, development of new market niches.
o
Infrastructure
Need to make better use of waterways. Gas should be included as possible source of
o
energy, not only hydroelectric;
Need help to carry out good environmental assessments and plans for large
o
infrastructure projects, i.e. waterways, railways;
Special needs in the area of communications. Many areas in the Amazon are outside
,a
the major communication grids; and
Urban development is a particular challenge in the Amazon, namely for small and
medium sized cities.

Human Development
CPS presentation is weak in the area of poverty an inequality;
o
The region has special challenges related to indigenous peoples, and riverside
o
populations. The Government is considering a social program called "Bolsa
Floresta"; and
The Region is considering a "Bolsa Trabalho", as an alternative to the "Bolsa
Familia" Program. It would include training, assistance for creating small
enterprises, and micro-credit.
Add*
and natural resource management
o Need to include:
o Mining, i.e. the need to organize the informal mining sector and to ensure

minimum environmental standards; and
Annex page 56

o Fisheries; and
o Major importance of land management in the Region. Need better balance between
incentives with enforcement. Quality of information for land management is still a
problem.

Development and Conservation in ma-ior Biomes
Need to define how the income generated by environmental services will be managed.
Innovation, Science and Technology
Innovation, Science and Technology are major challenges in their own right, not just subsections
of Human Development. It should be treated as a joint challenge for the private and public
sector.
Engagement with Municipalities
Bank Group needs to partner with State Governments to deal with challenges at the municipal
level. Policies do not get implemented and governance agenda cannot move without building
capacity at the municipal level. Municipalities are often isolated and not part of Regional
planning and management.
Meeting with Northeast Brazilian Authorities and Private Sector
Participants endorsed the proposal for a more ambitious program, for organizing the partnership
around major development challenges (desajios paradigmaticos), for putting more focus on
results, and for an emphasis on the "how to", as opposed to "what to". They suggested higher
profile for some areas, and added Regional multi-sector development as a new challenge to
consider. They proposed the WBG includes in its strategy options to engage with States with
fiscal problems and poor implementation capacity, and emphasized the need for WBG to partner
with States in the dialogue with the Federal Government on how to deal with challenges at
municipal level.
Development Challenges
Regional Multi-sector Development
Several participants pointed to the need to consider the challenge of Regional Development. In
their view, some issues, such as water and other infrastructure challenges, should be addressed at
the Regional level and not State by State, as the total is more than the sum of each Northeast
state part. Planning and funding for such challenge should be considered at the Regional level.
Regional development would also provide means to reduce inequality in the Northeast.
Bias towards Northeast Region
Some participants suggested that WBG programs and investments should have a strong bias
towards Northeast Brazil, given that the Region has the highest concentration of poverty and
inequality, as well as the lowest human development indicators in the Country.
For some speakers, the CPS should acknowledge the special needs of Northeast Brazil,
including:
o Logistics;
o Water-basin management and irrigation;
Annex page 57

o Institutional development, including regaining capacity in the area of planning (there
is a risk of the Northeast not being able to take advantage of the opportunities raised
by the National Accelerated Growth Program (PAC) for lack of good projects);
o Environment, i.e. recover significant damage done over the years;
o Use of market mechanisms to foster environmental and social sustainability;
o Reform of social security at the State level;
o Quality of education and labor force skills; and
o Innovation and diffusion of knowledge across the Region.

Private sector development
Representatives from the private sector focused on the need to associate small producers,
bringing them up to market standards and link them to the production - trade chain. They also
named the main challenges for private sector development in the Northeast (i.e. poor logistics
and infrastructure, poor business climate and excessive tax burden). Several participants
welcomed the WBG push to raising the bar in the area of good corporate governance and
environmental and social sustainability. There were suggestions for IFC partnerships with
regional financial institutions on:
o Microfinance;
o Support to small farmers;
o Agri-business;
o Guarantees; and
o Innovation and technology.
Engagement with States
Participants agreed that the WBG also engage with States that need fiscal support, which would
benefit the most from partnering with the Bank. The CPS should include a strategy for dealing
with States in difficult fiscal situation, and with less capacity, with a view to helping them in
fiscal, debt and public sector management.
Engagement with Municipalities
Some participants suggested a more decisive engagement of the States in the dialogue with the
Federal Government regarding the partnership with municipalities and agreed with the overall
WBG CPS urban development proposal.
Infrastructure Consultations
Participants noted that the role of WBG was critical on:
o Government (advisory, capacity building);
o Sectoral Strategy (definition, bringing in the private sector);
o Legal framework (notably concessions);
o Infrastructure investment: active participation in both structuring and financing process
o Local currency financing: IFC should focus on offering and structuring flexible loans in
Reais;
o WBG global know how: Active participation and worldwide know-how on the process is
a plus that only IFC has;
o IFC's early presence in project cycle is important to validate the project, giving
gwines;
o WBG should act more strategically supporting the Government on investment programs
& decision parameters for concessions - but also when WBG is opportunistic,
demonstration effect is key;
Annex page 58

o WBG should establish partnerships with leading institutions such as BNDES.
Financial Sector Consultations

According to participants, some of the areas that merit further attention and support from the
WBG include: capital market development in general with a focus on secondary market
development to increase liquidity and scale, and to lengthen maturities, particularly in fixed
income instruments.
IFC role as a market maker
Participants see IFC's role as key in:
Helping enhance securitization (especially using housing related debt instruments);
Exploring better ways to achieve Government policy objectives in housing, especially
through creative modifications to the existing directed credit scheme in housing to make
it more effective;
Enhancing stock exchange activities, especially for the small capitalization market;
Enhancing the business climate for venture capital funds;
Enhancing the capacity of regulators to do their jobs;
Improving business climate conditions (taxes, time and costs to open and close a
business, etc) inhibit the growth of micro credit;
"Doing Business" diagnostics translating into a detailed work agenda to allow further
micro credit expansion, although Brazil needs to find its own solutions;
Enhancing the operational potential of innovative, medium-sized banks, and providing
access to finance for smaller firms across the country.
Corporate Governance
Education and Dissemination: The WBG could help Brazilian leaders to better
disseminate their knowledge and support activities. The WBG could also leverage
international knowledge and better disseminate its educational modules on corporate
governance;
IFC should take into account that many firms are not yet convinced of the net benefits
(relative to the costs) of improving corporate governance.
Privatization and investment
The public sector is large, has a great impact on private sector investment, and could do
more to provide the conditions for substantial private investment increases;
The WBG should document the successful privatizations (costs and benefits). Examples
include telephones (cellular, prepaid cards, etc.) and roads. In addition, public
investment needs to become more effective, especially by states and municipalities.
Meeting with Civil Society Organizations
Participants endorsed the overall proposal and praised several aspects of the proposed CPS,
including:
o
The participatory nature of the CPS consultation process; and
New financial products, including competitive interest rates, guarantees and insurance
o
products.

Annex page 59

They suggested some areas for improvement including:
o
Need to address the challenge of violence and insecurity in its n~ultipleaspects,
including the human, social and econon~icones;
o
Need to address the related issues of Youth an gender;
o
Need to address the participation and integration of indigenous peoples and other
special groups, such as the Quilombolas, in the CPS;
o
Need to be clearer about the role of and the partnership with Civil Society
Organization, beyond consulting them on the CPS;
o
Clarify the links between different challenges and the need for horizontal, multi
sector solution;
o
Clarify the capacity of the WBG to leverage and act as memorylguardian for
continuity in long term policies and programs;
o
Add the Regional Development dimension which is essential for addressing many
challenges, including those related to logistics and infrastructure;
o
Clarify sector approaches of the CPS, since with a smaller WBG program, the sector
approach may not be adequate;
o
Special loan conditions for social programs;
o
Clearer description on how social safeguards are applied to WBG related projects and
programs, i.e. child labor, discrimination, slavery, etc;
o
Establish formal employment sector integration targets for Bank related projects and
programs; and
o
Direct WBG support to civil society-led pilot projects and programs.
Several participants suggested that the Bank be opportunistic, quick and flexible in its response
to demands. Participants made significant and specific suggestions including:
Public sector management
o
Fiscal decentralization and support to municipalities;
Need to keep the democracy agenda alive in the CPS; and
o
Benefit of including the media and communications as means to support good
o
governance.
Private sector development
Need to reduce subsidies to foster the private sector; and
o
Clearer explanation on how cooperatives can contribute to small farm and small
o
enterprise access to markets.
Infrastructure
o
Civil society consultation when considering large infrastructure projects;
o
Develop a series of environmental and social sustainability indicators and
benchmarks for large infrastructure projects; and
Consider that "clean energies" sometimes turn into "dirty energies".
o
Human Development
Inclusion of indigenous peoples in major social programs. At present indigenous
o
peoples do not benefit from the "Bolsa Familia" Program;
Address the special needs of vulnerable groups such as children, disabled, etc; and
o
Focus on how to improve the quality of education.
o

Annex page 60

Agriculture and natural resource management
Need to be clearer about how the Bank would address the issues related to small and
o
family based agriculture, i.e. in the areas of access to land, technology and market;
In the area of natural resource management and the environment, the CPS needs to be
o
complemented by macro policy and institutional building;
Natural resources should be treated as "Natural Capital", which should produce a
o
return; and
Bank may not have a comparative advantage in sanitation.
o
Development and Conservation in major Biomes
Again, indigenous peoples may need a special treatment in the Amazon Framework;
o
and
Develop for each major biome a development and conservation framework, as it is
o
currently being done for the Amazon.
Engagement with Municipalities
WBG needs to engage with municipalities, even if only with non-lending services.
municipalities have innovative proposals and programs which are not well known.

Many

Agribusiness Consultations
Participants endorsed the Strategic orientation of the CPS, but asked for a more focused set of
actions. They made several comments (mainly focused on the Amazon) and inputs listed along
the following themes:

Lack of Government capacity at all levels (Federal, State, and Municipal)
o One specific area of concern was animal health, especially concerning foot and mouth
disease, which include border, and enforcementlcontrol capabilities.
Weak legal framework:
o Improvement is essential for private companies' long term strategy;
o Perverse business environment where the rules are confusing making it difficult to
plan for long term investments;
o Favors the informal sector, making it difficult for larger companies to ensure
compliance/standards from their suppliers;
o Land titling is a major and complex issue;
o Current tax system is an impediment to exports.
Lack of infrastructure:
o transport, logistics, and energy are a main impediment to doing business.
Investments are badly needed. Weak regulations are the main obstacle;
o Need to makelcapitalize on links between deforested areas and logistic corridors.
WBG should strengthen engagement with EMBRAPA (Brazilian agricultural research
organization), which plays a critical role in agribusiness.
Most peoplelorganizations have poor info on Brazilian agribusiness potential, especially on
Amazon and Cerrado.
Annex page 6 1

o A serious effort is needed on "mapping" the Amazon and the Cerrado. This would
avoid generalization, and allow for a better focus on the singularity of each business
lines or sectors;
o Regional and sector diagnosis are key.

More attention needs to be given to municipalities:
o All are in need of training and capacity building;
o Small farmers are far less sophisticated and rely a lot on the municipalities, thus,
more focus on municipalities would help them join the formal economy.
Create/develop market incentives to promote the development of sustainable agriculture:
o Conditions need to be created so that socially responsible companies can invest into
sustainable agriculture in the Amazon and the Cerrado. Otherwise companies in the
informal sector will exploit these regions without any concern for sustainability;
o Biodiesel should be considered. A license system should be developed to allow
companies to invest in the already deforested areas;
o A broader effort is needed into developing productive chains in agribusiness
throughout Brazil;
o Access/development of biotechnologies should be favored, including the enforcement
of intellectual property rights. This would enhance productivity and quality of
products.
Amazon:
o the Amazon issues should be treated specifically and not necessary linked to other
agribusiness frontiers;
o There is a need to create value in the supply chain, notably through mapping of the 70
million hectares already deforested.
The WBG is well positioned to have a catalyzing role, notably to bring together leading
private sector companies, government (at all levels), NGOs, and local communities.
The WBG has an important role in providing a framework, and convening power to develop
a strategy based on regional specificities.
Meeting with Academia
Participants suggested some areas for improvement and better definition in other areas,
including:
o
The WBGYsprogram is too broad and lacks the desired selectivity;
o
Innovation, science technology should be addressed in its own right, not a sub
program under human development;
Strengthening of democratic institutions and processes should be part of the Bank's
a
"how to" agenda, in context of Brazil's social development;
Need to be willing to tailor solutions to the diverse contexts in Brazil;
o
Working with municipalities may be spreading resources too thin and counter the
o
selectivity objectivity;
Need more horizontal, multi sector approaches, as opposed to sector approach;
o
More consideration of the political economy, conflict mediation, so that the complex
a
policy reforms programs can hold.

Annex page 62

Participants made many significant and specific suggestions including:
Public sector management
o More focus on capacity building for program and project planning, execution, regulation,
supervision and control, which are weak at all levels, even at Federal level;
o Emphasis on tax reform, which is key for unleashing economic growth, is not clearly
mentioned in the CPS presentation;
o More emphasis on institutional building-strengthening of regulatory agencies is key.
Private sector development
Bank may need to look more the efficiency of the financial system, including to the issue of
compulsory deposits.
Agriculture and natural resource management
Environmental agencies lack the capacity to carry out the environmental assessments and
mitigation plans that are needed in relation to Brazil's infrastructure needs.
Engagement with Municipalities

WBG could be an important source of funds for municipalities, which in most cases would not
have access to good rates in the banking system. Most municipalities need significant capacity
building in the area of public sector management.

Annex page 63

Pending finalization of a Bank policy framework for guiding progressively greater use of country
systems in the areas of procurement and safeguards, there are areas where, within the Bank's
current policy framework, and because of the relatively sound state of Brazil's institutions, the
Bank has been able to make use of selective Brazil country systems. Recognizing that any
increase in use depends on the finalization of a formal policy framework for the use of country
systems, the Bank together with the Government of Brazil have agreed on actions that can be
taken, to help bring those systems not currently in use, to an internationally recognized standard
of performance, with the objective of improving their "readiness for use" status pending
finalization of Bank policy framework. The extent of current use of Brazilian systems, together
with actions that can be taken during the CPS period are as follows:
Financial Management
Over the last ten years, Brazil has adopted good governance as a national objective. As a result,
there is a high level of transparency, underpinned by a sound public financial management
system that provides reasonable assurance over the use of government and other public
resources. When compared to other similar Latin American nations (e.g., Mexico, Chile, and
Colombia), the systems and practices surrounding the control of spending during execution are
relatively strong.
As a result, since 2003, the Bank has used the government's management systems (SIAFI, SIAFI
Gerencial, and SIGMA) in connection with Bank supported operations. Specifically: (i) the Bank
utilizes project financial reports generated by these systems; (ii) the Bank uses the same
mechanisms that the Government uses for its own sub-national fiscal transfers, to support loan
disbursement applications; and (iii) for most operations the Bank relies on the audit work of
either the Secretaria Federal de Controle (SFC) or the Tribunal de Contas da UniGo (TCU).
Going forward, the issue is therefore one of bringing Brazil's public financial management
systems up to world-class standards in certain specific institutional and/or technical areas, in the
process fully completing the Bank's use of such systems.
Proposed actions during the forthcoming CPS Period are support for: (i) improvements in the
control and oversight framework of public expenditure through the proposed Good Governance
TAL; (ii) an alignment of Brazil's Chart of Accounts with international standards and
frameworks, again through the proposed Good Governance TAL; and (iii) policy dialogue in
connection with the upgrade and modernization of SIAFI.
Procurement
The regulatory and institutional frameworks are sound and generally conducive to the
achievement of the basic principles of economy, transparency, and efficiency15. However, these
frameworks could and should be further modernized to streamline and improve the

15

A potential risk, which will need to be further assessed, is a proposed amendtnent to the procurement law which would extend
the use of the reverse auction method to all procurement of works and consulting services. While reverse auction is generating
savings and has improved the efficiency of procurement oSoSS-the-shelfgoods, in our opinion it is not appropriate for other types
of procurement.

Annex page 64

Government's procurement strategy and the efficiency of its processes. A further issue, to be
explored, is the extent to which foreign bidders are able to participate freely in Brazilian markets.
A combination of increased thresholds and the use of the standard bidding documents represent
significant use of Brazil procurement systems as this represents over 90 percent of the
transactions financed by the Bank, in the Brazil portfolio. (The key exception is represented by
ICB.)

During the CPS period, the following further actions were proposed: (i) raising NCB Thresholds
to US$25 million and US$5 million for works and goods respectively; (ii) raising the threshold
for short-lists comprising only local firms to US$1 million; (iii) increasing, where risk
assessment permits, prior review thresholds; (iv) continuing policy dialogue with the
Government on the merits of the OECD benchmarking tool and undertaking the related
assessment if agreement is reached to do so; and (v) undertaking a market assessment to support
the proposed increase in the NCB thresholds.
Safeguards

The Bank has ten safeguard policies of which two, Projects in Disputed Areas and Projects on
International Waterways, are a matter of international treaties and therefore not subject to
individual country circumstances. Of the remaining eight, six are most pertinent in the context of
Brazil's current PAC strategy - Environmental Management; Natural Habitats; Forests;
Involuntary Resettlement; Indigenous Peoples; and Pest Management. With respect to these,
only the legal and regulatory framework for environmental assessments is generally adequate
with all other frameworks requiring significant strengthening. In addition, in connection with all
six, institutional arrangements are generally not well coordinated leading to gaps and overlaps.
Finally, under Brazilian law, safeguards-related action plans, as well as the monitoring of their
implementation, is mostly the responsibility of states and municipalities and, in these
jurisdictions, although there is variability, capacity is generally weak.
In compliance with current operating procedure, the Bank appraises Brazil's proposed
arrangements (in other words Brazil's existing institutional arrangements) for project
implementation against the requirements of relevant Bank safeguards policies. Where these
meet the Bank's requirements the Bank uses them. Where they don't, project specific action
plans are agreed to bridge the gap.
At the moment many of the "bridging" action plans to address implementation capacity
constraints are developed at project specific level, but their structure and content are somewhat
repetitive in nature because the major constraints tend to be the same for projects in all sectors
and jurisdictions. Accordingly, the most strategic Bank intervention at this time is the adoption
of more holistic support for strengthening such capacity at sub-national level, reducing a need for
project specific interventions going forward. In alignment with the Bank's proposed program of
support during the CPS period, the states of Cear6, Minas Gerais, and S5o Paulo would be the
initial focus for this holistic approach with the following proposed actions: (i) support for
improved institutional coordination, and monitoring and implementation capacity. This would
involve undertaking state wide diagnostics, in respect of the six relevant safeguard policies, with
results of the diagnostics informing capacity strengthening components that can be included in
the Bank's proposed program of support during the period; and (ii) leverage WBI support for
strengthening of sub-national environmental management and licensing processes particularly
Annex page 65

extending support to Ministerio Ptiblico, the various SISNAMA bodies, and private sector
institutions involved in the environmental licensing process.

Summary
The table below sets out the Bank's determination of the extent to which, by reference to these
key elements, Brazil systems meet Bank safeguards. Supporting annexes set out the extent to
which selective areas of country systems are in use as well as issues/actions that can be taken to
bring those areas not already in use, to a "readiness for use" status.

ANNEX8: BRAZILCOUNTRY
FINANCING
PARAMETERS
March 2008
T h e country financing parameters for Brazil are set out below and are being posted on the Bank's internal website.
Item
Cost Sltaring. Limit on the proportion of
individual project costs that the Bank may
finance.

Parameter
Up to 100%

Recurrent costfinancittg. Any limits that
would apply to the overall amount of recurrent
expenditures that the Bank may finance.

Recurrent cost
financing would
be based on
specific criteria.

Local costfinancing. Are the requirements
for Bank financing of local expenditures met,
namely that: (i) financing requirements for
country's development program would exceed
the public sector's own resources (e.g., from
taxation and other revenues) and expected
domestic borrowing; and (ii) the financing of
foreign expenditures alone would not enable
the Bank to assist in the financing of
individuals projects.

Yes

Taxes and duties. Are there any taxes and
duties the Bank would not finance?

Duties on specific
items that exceed
twice the average
import duty rate.

Annex page 67

RemarksIExplanation
The Bank's financing share in individual
projects is likely to be differentiated by
government level, region and sector. Bank
financing of 100% may take place in selected
cases (e.g., for the social sectors, the poorer
Northeast region). The Bank's program
envisages greater use of SWAps; on these, the
Bank's financing share is typically expected to
be significantly lower than the limit.

Criteria would include: fiscal sustainability,
commitment to sound fiscal management, high
level of budget management and execution, and
demonstration of sustainability of Bank-financed
recurrent activities. In the case of salaries, the
Government would need to endorse Bank
financing. Financing of project implementation
unit (PIU) salaries would be done only in the
context of an overall approach on financing of
PIUs aimed at ensuring sustainability.

Duties on specific items that exceed twice the average
import duty rate (currently 25%) would not be
financed by the Bank. In projects where these are
material, the borrower's financial contribution would
be sufficient to cover these amounts.

Summary and Questions for Discussion
Brazil has had a good four years. Economic stability and social programs have succeeded in
making an impressive dent in poverty and inequality. Environmental sustainability is being
better integrated. Fiscal management has been consistent and strong, and external risks have
been substantially reduced. Reform measures are improving the prerequisites for economic
growth, although this has been slower that hoped and growth rates lag both projections and
regional comparators. As a result, Brazil today faces a very different outlook than it did four
years ago. The challenge today is to improve the conditions for growth, while securing fiscal
sustainability and deepening equity gains.
During this CAS period the Bank has been an effective partner, building well on its
comparative advantages in a number of areas.

Figure 1 provides a schematic overview of how the Bank has contributed to the four thematic
"pillars" of the CAS.
A More Equitable Brazil. Brazil
made remarkable gains in reducing
inequality. In the context of strong
government commitment, good
analytical underpinnings, a good
mix of mutually-reinforcing Bank
instruments, and strong proactivity,
Bank impact was high. Support
was relevant, timely and often
catalytic. IFC selected projects
reaching the bottom of the pyramid
with the objective of demonstrating
the role of the private sector via
corporate social responsibility and

linkages to SME suppliers.
A More Sustainable Brazil. Brazil's growth was slow in the first three years of the
CAS period, but picked up substantially in 2007. The Bank played a supporting role,
using AAA, TA, special grant programs and lending not only to support but to
proactively motivate action. IFC complemented the Bank by helping set sustainability
benchmarks in the private sector.
A More Competitive Brazil. Brazil's growth was slow in the first three years of the
CAS period, but picked up substantially in 2007. The Bank had moderate impact,
deepening its support compared with the previous CAS period, and making use of a
combination of DPLs, TA and AAA. IFC focused on improving competitiveness in the
private sector by: broadening access to finance, supporting the infrastructure agenda, and
improving the business environment.
Good Governance and Public Sector Management. Progress has been mixed. On
the one hand, Brazil has achieved remarkable success in consolidating economic
stabilization and the institutions for credible economic management. On the other hand,
Annex page 68

broad reform of the regulatory and administrative environment has not advanced, with a
few notable exceptions. Bank impact was mixed. The Bank has contributed effectively to
improving procurement, and to improving results-oriented public sector management in a
few states.
There are a number of conclusions and lessons in the attached report, related both to the nature
and operational modus operandi of Bank work. The detailed outcome-by-outcome analysis in
particular is included in the Annex. Among the main questions that emerge from this report on
the direction of Bank support include:
Less is more. The Bank's CAS was both broad (sectorally) and deep (all levels of
government). It also included areas where the Bank perhaps did not have a particular
advantage (e.g. culture), and where the Bank was perhaps not particularly needed (e.g.,
debt management). Selectivity criteria (e.g. for sub-nationals) in the heat of lending
enthusiasm are easily overlooked. And the challenge with any strategy is that the
existing program must be subsumed, whether or not it fits. Greater focus is important.
But how best to achieve it, and as importantly, how to stick to it?
Global Brazil. A great many of Brazil's development challenges will continue to lie in
the nexus of environment and growth. With its important natural endowments, its
conservation achievements in the last four years, and relevant experience (e.g., biofuels
and carbon trading), Brazil is maturing into a global environmental leader. How can the
Bank emerge from engagement primarily on the conservation side, to becoming a "full
service partner" to Brazil as it grapples with the challenge of reconciling conservation
with necessary economic development in sensitive biomes? How can the Bank Group
engage with governments (Federal and State and municipal), the private sector, and civil
society, and how can the Bank's wide array of lending and non-lending instruments be
better focused toward these objectives?
Growth "the Brazilian way." Achieving higher rates of growth is an unquestioned
challenge and is the major objective of the second administration of President Lula.
Brazil has put in place several vital elements - sound fiscal and macro policies which are
broadly accepted, and mechanisms for substantially improving income distribution. How
can the Bank provide effective lending and non-lending support in, on the one hand,
consolidating the fiscal and equity gains, but, on the other hand, investing in
infrastructure and addressing tax, social security, labor and public sector management
reforms which are essential if Brazil is to grow?
What is an effective lending program in a very liquid Brazil: Lending in the 20032007 CAS was focused heavily on the Federal Government and mostly used DPLs. This
was driven, in good part, by the Finance Ministry's (legitimate) need to increase foreign
exchange reserves. Now Brazil has all of the foreign exchange reserves it needs. And
with the launching of the PAC (Accelerated Growth Program) most federal agencies have
adequate resources.
A key challenge for the Bank in the next period will be the
definition of a lending and non-lending program in a much more liquid environment.

The sub-national double-edged sword. States are increasingly fiscally sound, and have
substantial public investment needs. There is unlimited demand from municipalities. As
federal demand decreases sub-nationals are a logical new client base for the World Bank.
Annex page 69

Can or should the Bank be present in all 27 states? The current CAS set out selection
criteria that were observed only in the breach. Caveat emptor.. .
What is success? Finally, one of the conclusions of this report is that Bank support has
had most impact when:

the policy and reform environment is propitious, with strong commitment;
the analytical underpinnings of the issue are well understood (government, Bank,
other AAA);
core human resource and institutional capacity exists; and
the Bank team itself does not hesitate to use creative, proactive and even risky
strategies to advance the agenda.
Where are the areas where these conditions likely to be present, moving forward? If
these (or another set of conditions that seem particularly essential) are not present, can the
Bank help to create these conditions? Should the Bank move forward in the absence of
such conditions?
I. Introduction
1.
At the outset of the FY04-07 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) the dual challenges of
the new government were (i) maintaining economic stability -- in the face of external
vulnerability and a crisis of confidence in international markets -- and (ii) reversing the
substantial inequalities in Brazilian society. Today, macroeconomic management has been
exemplary, external vulnerability substantially reduced, exports and reserves are at their highest
historic levels and inflation and country risk at their lowest. Targeted programs and policies
have brought income-based poverty down and improved equality in service provision; Brazil has
met a number of its Millennium Development Goal targets already, and is well on track for the
remainder by 2015. In short, Brazil has come very far over the CAS period.
2.
Nevertheless, growth has remained below hoped-for levels, due in part to a high tax
burden, high interest rates, and remaining microeconomic inefficiencies. There has been little
progress in improving the efficiency of the public sector where budget rigidities and earmarked
current expenditure crowd out investment, contributing to the damper on growth. The evolution
of two indicators provides an illustration of developments over the last four years: In 2002,
Brazil was rated 60 worldwide in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, but 73 in the
UN's human development indicator (HDI). The CAS highlighted the gap as a way of calling
attention to the challenge of improving social wellbeing. Today, Brazil's GDP per capita is
ranked 68, and its HDI 69. While the HDI has improved, and there is now greater coherence
between the two indicators, Brazil has lost ground relative to other countries in terms of GDP per
capita. This captures the core of Brazil's development challenge today: improving the conditions
for growth, while maintaining macroeconomic stability and deepening equality gains.

3.
This CAS Completion Report (CR) argues that the Bank was overall an effective partner
under the FY04-07 CAS, providing high-impact catalytic support in several areas. This CR also
flags some lost opportunities where more perhaps could have been achieved, and draws lessons

learned.

Annex page 70

11. Completion Report Objective and Organization
4.
This CR is a self-assessment of the FY04-07 Brazil C A S ' ~(the core elements of which
are revisited in Section I11 below). It is based on substantive inputs from the country team. It
employs the results framework built into the CAS, used in evaluations during periodic program
discussions with the government, and in the 2006 CAS Progress Report. Building on this
framework, it evaluates CAS results along three axes.17

First, it assesses progress made by Brazil in meeting development goals and mediumterm outconzes set out in the CAS. The CAS goals in turn are based on Brazil's own
multi-year plan (described in Section IV). This includes assessing progress toward 16
long-term indicators that form part of the CAS results framework (including the MDGs).
Gaps and future challenges are also identified.
Second, it looks at tlze Bank's impact in lzelping to achieving these results. As in most
middle-income countries, it is difficult to attribute a specific role for the Bank, a very
small player in a large, complex economy. Nor is it possible in this report to evaluate the
counterfactual, i.e., the case without Bank support. As a proxy, the report makes a
qualitative assessment of Bank impact. Both Brazil's progress and Bank impact are
discussed by goal and outcome area (in Section V).
Third, the report assesses Bank performance (Section VI).
While it was not possible to do extensive interviews for this CR, a client survey provides
5.
some additional qualitative feedback (Section VII). Finally, by drawing out conclusions and
lessons learned (Section VIII), the CR builds a bridge to the FY08-11 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), including assessing the results framework and suggesting refinements.
111. Brazil's Strategic Goals: A Brazil For All

Brazil's development agenda and strategic goals are put forth in a multi-year plan ("Plano
6.
Plurianual," or PPA), which coincides with the four-year federal government mandate. The PPA
requires legislative approval, and as the driver of annual government budgets functions
something like a medium-term expenditure framework. Each of the 27 states (including the
federal district) also has its own PPA, which is coherent with the overall federal PPA and upon
which annual state budgets are also based. The federal government's 2004-2007 PPA, entitled
"Um Brasil Para Todos" (A Brazil For All), was prepared with substantial civil society
participation and rests on five inter-related dimensions: social, economic, regional,
environmental and democratic.18 These combined into three core objectives:
Enhanced social inclusion and reduction of inequality;
Economic growth, with reduced regional inequality and environmental sustainability; and

Input to this CR included QAG and IEG reviews, project implementation completion reports (ICRs), program and
portfolio reviews with the government. inputs from and discussions in the country team, a review of Brazil's multiyear plan, and a client survey. While the main focus is the FY04-07 period, the CAS CR also looks to FY00-02/03
CAS, the CR for that CAS (included as an annex to the current CAS), and OED's Country Assistance Evaluation
(CAE) of 2002 for medium-term context setting.

Promotion of citizenship and participation, contributing to better governance and public
sector management.
These three objectives were to be implemented through nearly 400 programs, each of
7.
which is individually managed, implemented, monitored and evaluated. The PPA foresaw $1 50
billion in annual in spending, with funding linked to macroeconomic and revenue projections,
along with prudent borrowing and plans for private sector investment. While the 2004-07 PPA
evolved from the previous PPA and its core has much in common, among noteworthy
differences for the current period were: augmenting the overall level of social transfers,
prioritizing land reform, gender and inclusion, initiatives to strengthen governance, and
improvements in domestic capital markets. With minor exceptions noted in the text below, the
government's goals did not change during the CAS period. However, it is noteworthy that of the
three core objectives above, the first two took greater precedence both in government public
statements as well as in policy action and program financing.
8.
While a full evaluation of the FY04-07 PPA is not yet available, the annual 2006
evaluation indicated a number of conclusioils that foreshadow issues addressed in this C R . ' ~
Overall, PPA implementation was considered to be satisfactory -- i.e., 78 percent of programs
had met or exceeded targets -- despite a number of rather serious difficulties. Among the three
main concerns voiced by PPA program managers:
Lack of adequate human resources (two-thirds of programs);
Budget rigidities (particularly "contingenciamento", or the budget-freeze process) which
results in uncertain financial flows (60 percent of programs); and
Legal and fiscal/financial hurdles to timely signing of contracts and "convenios"
(agreements) for financing or implementation (50 percent of programs).
9.
More generally, environmental licensing complications, inadequate monitoring and
evaluation, and lack of realism in program design were also cited as important bottlenecks.
These issues will be echoed in the implementation issues confronted by Bank-supported projects
(below).
IV. Bank Strategic Objectives, Long Term Goals and CAS Outcomes
More than a dozen sectoral policy notes had been prepared for the incoming government.
10.
They were well received and played a role in the new government's policy planning, including
influencing the PPA process. These policy notes also served as a foundation for the CAS. CAS
preparation was also highly participatory, relying on substantial consultation with all three levels
of government in Brazil -- federal, state and municipal -- as well as wide variety of civil society
groups and partner agencies. The Bank's Brazil CAS was a natural outgrowth of the Bank's
strategy over the previous decade, and specifically built on the FY00-03 CAS, the core thematic
areas of which were (i) fiscal sustainability, (ii) poverty alleviation, (iii) growth promotion, (iv)
environmental sustainability, and (v) governance. The Completion Report for the FY00-03 CAS
had concluded that while substantial progress had been made in fiscal sustainability, and good
progress in poverty alleviation, challenges remained in the areas of growth promotion,
environmental sustainability and governance. Based on these inputs, the CAS defined four areas
where the Bank could add value to Brazil's efforts in FY04-07. These were captured in a vision

economically stable.

Brazil CAS Results Framework
The FY04-07 CAS was one of six countries that served as a "Results Pilot." The results
framework was thus preliminary, and was expected to be fine-tuned over time. The framework
relied on four core elements of results monitoring:
* Long Term Goals. Twelve long-term goals were established (three in each of the four
thematic areas), and one or more long-term development indicator (including the MDGs and a
number of long-term indicators set out in the PPA). These indicators were an integral part of the
CAS (Table 4) and were monitored at the Progress Report stage, and updated in this Completion
Report.
* Intermediate "CAS Outcomes" and Outcome Indicators. Several intermediate outcomes
were established for each goal area. For each of these "CAS Outcomes" a specific indicator -which would identify whether the outcome had been substantially achieved -- was established.
Monitoring of these outcomes and outcome indicators was also part of the CAS (Annex 10) and
the Progress Report. The first step in monitoring outcomes was to assess Brazil's performance.
The second step was to assess the Bank's contribution to this progress in terms of qualitative
impact.
* Ongoing Monitoring. A third feature of the CAS results framework was agreement with the
government to review program performance annually, in the context of the agreed framework.
This was to be done in the context of the annual program and portfolio review.
11.
The CAS also prioritized several ways of doing business. It sought an "opportunitiesand-risks" approach that maximized flexibility. It aimed explicitly at scaling up successes. It
prioritized greater sectoral integration and synergies. And finally, the CAS promised a higher
level of Bank support (the high case) if warranted. Development policy loans (DPLs) in each of
the four thematic areas were designed to take a lead role. Accompanying technical assistance
loans (TALs) aimed to support advances in the reform agenda (including meeting targets for
subsequent DPL phases).
Sector-wide approaches (SWAps), projects based on a core
government programs and country systems, were intended to be a primary investment lending
modality. SWAps were also seen as a way of improving implementation performance, in
particular regarding slow disbursement. Lending to sub-national governments (both states and
municipalities) was a third operational vehicle. Importantly, the CAS was a "results pilot" and
put in place a preliminary results-monitoring framework (box).

V. CAS Results Assessment
12.
The FY04-07 CAS outlined a program that was among the Bank's largest (up to US$7.5
billion in lending over four years), broadest (touching on virtually every aspect of economic and
social development) and "deepest" (active at federal, state and municipal levels). The following
sections assess Brazil's progress and the Bank's role in the FY04-07 "time slice."

Annex page 73

A. A More Equitable Brazil
Overview. Brazil made remarkable gains in reducing inequality over the last four
13.
years. As detailed in the Annex, substantial progress was made in each of three goal areas
defined in the CAS: (i) reduced poverty, vulnerability and exclusion, (ii) better knowledge and
skills and (iii) longer, healthier lives. In the context of strong government commitment, good
analytical underpinnings, well-designed lending, TA and proactivity, Bank impact was
high. Support was relevant, timely and often catalytic. The lead instrument for Bank
assistance was the programmatic human development reform loan series, the first of which
(US$505.05 million, FY03) supported improved accountability, quality and targeting of social
policies and programs, protected of 21 core social program budgets during a vulnerable period at
the outset of the new administration, and secured commitment of the government to continued
policy improvements. The Human Development Technical Assistance Loan (US$8 million,
FY06) helps develop institutional capacity to monitor progress and impact of social polices and
programs, building a results-culture in the agencies it supports.

1. Reduced poverty, vulnerability and exclusion

14.
Achievements. Poverty reduction and income distribution indicators have dramatically
improved. During the early 1990s, the full poverty rate was about 41 percent. It dropped sharply
to about 33-34 percent in 1995 and then persisted at about this rate until 2003. In 2003, Brazil
experienced a steady decline of about 3 percent a year20. In 2006 the full poverty rate fell to 25.6
percent. In 2006 alone, it is estimated that some 6 million Brazilians moved out of poverty.
Extreme poverty rates followed a similar path, falling from 14.5 percent in 2003 to 9.1 percent in
2006. Using the Bank's global definition of "less than $1 a day", the poverty headcount ratio
dropped steadily from 14 percent of the population to 8 percent from 1990 to 2004, and is now
for the first time in single-digit figures. Beginning in 2001, the income inequality (Gini) index
also began a historic course, falling from 0.60 in 2002 to 0.54 in 2006. Low inflation and
economic growth, targeted transfer programs (including "Bolsa Familia," a conditional cash
transfer program), improvements in labor productivity due to gains in schooling, and a reduction
in the geographic segmentation of labor markets2' have all helped fuel this substantial
improvement. This does not imply the luxury of complacency on the equity agenda. Brazil's
inequality remains among the highest in the world, and millions of people still live in poverty.
Challenges and gaps. In this overall highly positive picture, a key challenge is moving
the equity agenda from temporary transfers to sustainable solutions in the context of
employment and making the needed link with growth. At issue is a complex nexus of economic
and social issues -- not only growth and the job opportunities this creates, but also continuing
rigidities in the labor market, the high rate of informality, urban crime and the future dynamism
of cities, and the issues surrounding higher education, competitiveness and innovation. Shifting
the equity focus regionally is also a relevant challenge; with notable progress in the Northeast,
there is justification for the Bank's continued shifting of equity focus to the North.

2. Better knowledge and skills
16.
Achievements. Continued progress was made in education. Long-term indicators of
performance have improved, if slowly. Primary enrollment increased slightly (and the MDG
target of 100 percent for 2015 is feasible). Net secondary enrollment increased more
substantially from 36 percent to 46 percent (meeting the PPA target) but remains low overall.
The girl-to-boy literacy ratio is now at parity (from 1.03 at the outset of the CAS) and adult
literacy has increased. Brazil's education system is also improving in quality and effectiveness.
The youth literacy rate improved from 92 percent to 97 percent during 1990-2006.

Challenges and gaps. Brazil has made great progress in increasing coverage of basic
17.
education. Now the challenge shifts to the more difficult issues of improving quality, of
addressing systemic institutional and managerial issues, and of defining what educational
resources Brazil needs for education and growth.
3. Longer, healthier lives

Achievements. Brazil made good progress in health care. Long-term indicators showed
18.
a trend toward better health outcomes: Infant mortality fell from 29 per 1,000 births to 24
(consistent with the PPA target, and within reach of the MDG goal of 16 by 201 5), and maternal
mortality remained stable. The number of births attended by skilled health staff increased and
the incidence of tuberculosis per 100,000 people dropped from 94.3 people in 1990 to 40 people
in 2005. New AIDS cases increased from 15.9 per 100,000 but only slightly, and AIDS
mortality has substantially declined. There were also important improvements in the health of
indigenous populations.
Challenges and gaps. As in education, the health system suffers from "low bang for the
19.
buck". Both spending and mortality are in the upper tier (20 percent) among Latin American
countries due to the poor quality of care, low efficiency in public spending and inadequate
performance accountability. Hospitals, many of which are small and overstaffed, consume 70
percent of sector spending. Although health service coverage is no longer a key challenge,
inequity persists in the quality of service. Compared to the top income quintile, the lowest
income quintile has 80 percent as much vaccination coverage, and 97 percent as many births in
hospitals, but in outcomes, the lowest income quintile has 2.9 times as much infant mortality and
3.7 times as much child (under 5) mortality. In addition, as the population ages and incomes
increase, the burden of disease shifts toward non-communicable diseases (NCDs), Brazil will
inevitably face the ticking time bomb of health costs that other countries have faced. Already
representing over two-thirds of Brazil's disease burden, NCDs typically affect the poor, have a
significant productivity impact, and are costly to treat and long lasting. However, they are often
less expensive to prevent. This shift toward non-communicable diseases requires a shift in
focus, away from curative care and towards prevention, and away of acute care toward integrated
care management. The challenge going forward is for the Government to finish the job of
addressing infectious and childhood diseases, but at the same time intensify the focus on NCDs
and the elderly. At the same time there is a critical need to: 1) promote accountability and
performance links in health financing; 2) raise the efficiency and quality of public spending; and
3) rationalize service supply and financing, while increasing a f f ~ r d a b i l i t ~ . ~ ~

B. A More Sustainable Brazil
20.
Brazil took important steps to improvement environmental sustainability during the
period. Initiatives were taken in each of three CAS goal areas: (i) more equitable access to local

services; (ii) better water quality and water resource management; and (iii) improved forestry
and biodiversity. On the one hand, water resources are being more efficiently managed and
Brazil has made historic strides in setting aside protected areas. On the other hand, access to
housing and water and sanitation services has improved only marginally, in part because of
necessary choices in a tight fiscal situation. The Bank played an important role both in areas
where progress was made (conservation and water resources) and in areas where the
challenge was to maintain and build a basis for the time when resources would become
available (water and sanitation). A pillar of the Bank's program was the Programmatic
Reform Loan for Environmental Sustainability ($501.2 million, FY05) supporting Brazil's goal
of balancing economic growth with social development, and mainstreaming environmental
management in seven line ministries. An accompanying Technical Assistance Loan (US$7.94
million, FY06) supported, among other measures, restructuring of Brazil's Environment Ministry
(MMA) and its National Environment Institute (IBAMA) and simplified procedures for
environmental licensing.
21.
IFC worked on establishing industry benchmarks to guide corporate behavior and help
companies espouse and internalize ever higher sustainability standards. The Corporation worked
at different levels with various partners to create examples that can be emulated in the area of
sustainability. These include working at:

the enterprise level to help selected companies better manage their environmental and social
issues with the view to establishing a demonstration effect within the industries they operate
in;
The capital market level by establishing partnerships with BOVESPA to develop stock
market indices (Novo Mercado listing , Sustainability index) that provides the right market
based incentives (better pricing of their stocks) for companies to improve their corporate
governance and overall sustainability standards;
The level of the banking industry through the adoption of the Equator Principles as a core
element of the lending policies of banks. The first 3 domestic banks in the world to adopt the
Equator
are all Brazilian banks. Another project included the sustainability
credit line to ABN Arnro/Banco Real for midsize companies.
The global level by defrning new environmental guidelines, safeguards and disclosure
policies that take account of the interests of as broad a range of stakeholders as possible.

Cosan - In June 2005, IFC committed a US$50 million loan and a US$20 million quasi-equity loan to Cosan S.A.
Cosan is the leading sugar and fuel ethanol producer in Brazil.
ItambC - In October 2005, IFC approved an A-Loan of up to US$15 million to Cooperativa Central dos
Produtores Rurais de Minas Gerais (Itambe). Itambe is Brazil's largest dairy cooperative and the second largest
dairy company after Nestle. The project provided ItambC with financing to upgrade and expand its facilities to
increase its production capacity.
Bauducco - In June 2007, IFC committed a US$30 million loan to help Bauducco, a traditional and well know line
of baked-cakes and crackers in Brazil and one of the main companies in the Brazilian specialty food sector, to
expand its production and logistics capacity. The company's investment program is allowing the company to
increase sales in the Northeast region, the largest biscuit and crackers market in Brazil, by lower costs; take
advantage of segments that are rapidly expanding (impulse products); expand exports: improve logistics, with
resulting cost reductions; and improve management efficiency by consolidating headquarters in one facility. For
Bauducco, IFC is a partner to facilitating the adoption of best practices in environmental, social and corporate
governance issues.
Bertin - In March, 2007, after a two-year due-diligence process IFC approved a $90 million loan to support
Bertin's corporate investment program to expand and modernize its operations across the country and help it
develop a system, the first of its kind in Brazil, to ensure that Bertin's cattle is sourced from ranchers that use
sustainable practices and do not contribute to increased deforestation of the Amazon.
Amaggi - In September 2004, IFC committed a second loan of US$30 million to Amaggi in Mato Grosso to fund
the Company's expansion plans. Following the publication of a report on increased rates of deforestation in
Amazonia, projects of this nature have been under scrutiny by civil society and authorities. We have worked
extensively with Amaggi since the time of our first investment to put in place prudent safeguards to address
possible concerns in this area.
Vale d o Parana- IFC made an investment for the the construction of the Vale do Parana mill, a greenfield sugar
and ethanol plant located in the State of Sao Paulo. Vale do Parana is a joint venture of Unialco S.A. of Brazil,
Inversiones Manuelita S.A. of Colombia, and Pantaleon Sugar Holdings of Guatemala. IFC is financing US$35
million ofthe total US$103 million project.

Proiects in Manufacturing
Embraer - Tier I example In June 2005, IFC committed a US$35 million loan to Embraer - Empresa Brasileira
de Aeronautica S.A. (Embraer). The IFC loan was accompanied by a B Loan of US$145 million. Embraer is one
of the world's leading commercial aircraft manufacturers, and is the largest manufacturer located in a developing
country. IFC is helping Embraer reduce its emissions of volatile compounds and integrate international reporting
standards into its internal financial monitoring. The project provided financing on commercial terms, for the
launch of the new Embraer 1701190 Family of aircraft.
Randon - In June 2007, IFC committed US$35 million for two projects: (i) US$25 million to Randon S.A.
lmplementos e Participa~tiesfor the installation of an electrostatic and water-based painting line replace the
existing painting processes with state-of-the-art technology to reduce the air and water effluents, improve the
product quality and achieve cost savings; and (ii) US$IO million to Fras-le S.A. for the expansion of brake pad
manufacturing capacity to supply a new order from DaimlerChrysler.

4. More equitable access to local services
22.
Achievements. Progress in improving basic local services for those least served was
slow overall during the CAS period. In particular, a stalemate in defining institutional and
financing arrangements in the water supply sector held back public sector investment
substantially. Water service provision deficits fell from 22 percent to 17 percent, and housing
subsidy targeting improved (from 45 percent of subsidies to low income to 65 percent). Most
significantly during the period, the last several years saw approval of key new policy and
Annex page 77

institutional measures in housing and water (notably a new water law and concession law),
however, which should pave the way for more rapid progress in service provision in the coming
period. The Bank's PCPRs (rural poverty programs) in the Northeast played an important role in
improving the supply of water supply and electricity to poor communities. The Bank's
continued work on improving the legal and regulatory framework for the provision of urban
water supply and sanitation services bore little fruit in the CAS period, but are an important
foundation for recently-launched major government investments in these areas.
23.
Challenges and gaps. Service provision in both urban and rural areas remains a major
challenge in Brazil. The population without electricity in the North and Northeast remains high
(in particular in rural areas). Underinvestment in water and sanitation has actually increased the
service deficits for the poorest. (While it is promising that the government's new Growth
Acceleration Plan (PAC) includes substantial earmarked funding for water and sanitation, one
product of years of underinvestment is a reduction in the capacity to plan and execute projects.)
World Bank engagement with municipalities has been fraught with many false starts and long
approval delays. The Federal Government has yet to define an effective framework for Bank
engagement with municipalities.
5.

Better water quality and water resource management

24.
Achievements. There have been important gains in building the institutions and policies
needed for efficient management of water resources, a key particularly for the arid Northeast. A
National Water Resource Management Plan was launched and the number of water basins with
water rights allocated increased from 10 percent of major basins to 23 percent. The Bank has
played a major role in launching a strong professional National Water Agency (ANA) and in
developing national and state-level programs which address infrastructure and water
management in an integrated fashion.
25.
Challenges and gaps. Efficient use of scarce water resources will take on everincreasing importance in the Northeast region, as it continues economic growth. Water quality,
particularly in urban areas, is a tremendous and growing challenge and is likely to take on
increasing importance. Since most of Brazil's unexploited hydropower potential is in the
Amazon region, water development and management in this area, too, is a great challenge.

6. More sustainable land management, forestry and biodiversity

26.
Achievements. Brazil substantially increased its share of land area under protection
(from 8 to 13 percent of total) and as indigenous lands (from 1 1- 12 percent of total), doubled the
area of forest under sustainable forestry. The Bank-administered PPG7 program and specific
GEF-funded programs have made major contributions. Together with the Bank IFC helped
introduce sustainability standards in agribusiness and manufacturing from tier I corporates to
SME suppliers (Amaggi and Bertin).
27.
Challenges and gaps. Paradoxically, hand-in-hand with record levels of protection,
have been record levels of deforestation (albeit with a declining trend towards the end of the
CAS period). This paradox suggests that declaration of protected areas is necessary, but not
sufficient. To be effective it must be complemented by actions to reduce deforestation in areas
that will never be protected. What is needed in the Amazon is an integrated program which (a)
manages protected areas effectively (b) provides incentives for reducing deforestation of nonAnnex page 78

protected areas and (c) increases the economic product (and employment in already deforested
areas). This will require commitment, imagination and resources.
C. A More Competitive Brazil

28. Brazil made measured advances on its growth agenda, but the overall result has been
disappointing. At the outset of the CAS period the government defined a program of initiatives
to improve growth potential and competitiveness, including (a) improving infrastructure
efficiency, quality and coverage, (b) enhancing the efficiency and depth of the financial sector,
and (c) increasing competition and innovation capacity. The Bank deepened its support in
these areas, compared with the previous CAS period, and made good use in particular of
TA and AAA. The Bank supported this agenda through a Second Programmatic Loan for
Sustainable and Equitable Growth (US$601.5 million, FY06), and a Sustainable and Equitable
Growth Technical Assistance Program (FYUS$12.12 million, FY05). As further detailed below,
important progress has been made. But the average growth rate in the period 2003-2006 was 2.6
percent (3 percent using new data), below the average for the region (4.5 percent) for emerging
market economies (8-9 percent) and the PPA projection (5 percent). In an era of unusually
favorable external conditions (stability and high demand for commodities) Brazil's growth
record was poor. The Bank's assistance did not make a difference in the short run, at least.

29. Throughout the CAS period though, IBRD and IFC worked together in support of the
private sector. IBRD and IFC developed closer partnerships on key areas such as agribusiness
(Amaggi and Bertin), manufacturing, infrastructure (supporting PPPs and building relations with
BNDES), access to finance, and improving the business environment, so as to have a more
focused an integrated approach maximizing the impact of the WBG assistance.

30. During the CAS period, IFC's program focused on four main areas - development of
financial markets, infrastructure, manufacturing and agribusiness, in addition to promoting
sustainability as a cross-cutting theme. IFC's intervention evolved from supporting tier I banks
(notably reactivating trade lines) and corporations to the tier I1 segment of the market. This
reflected improved access to finance for tier I companies, the opening up of the Brazilian
economy to global trade (IFC financed several agribusiness and manufacturing exporting
companies such as Amaggi, Bertin, Embraer), and supporting the consolidation of growth
generating sector such as petrochemicals (Ipiranga, Suzano)
7. Improved infrastructure
Achievements. Brazil's infrastructure was ranked 71 among 125 countries -- lower than
31.
most comparators. Improved infrastructure would both contribute to higher growth as well as to
improved living standards especially for the poorest. Public infrastructure investment as a share
of GDP has remained under 1 percent during the CAS period (and much of the last decade),
crowded out by large current expenditures and a rigid budget framework (below). One casualty
was the electric power sector's unusual vulnerability to drought, which caused the 2002
"apagiio" (brown-out). There have been similarly-dramatic failures in the air transport system,
and quieter but no less important failures in surface transport. On the private sector side,
regulatory uncertainty and contract renegotiation are among the risks holding back investment.
A landmark federal law regulating public private partnerships (PPPs) was passed in 2005, and a
first group of projects are being prepared under this framework (largely in road transport). The
Bank is supporting the government's PPP unit through an IDF grant. The IFC is active as an
advisor to government on PPPs and has developed a PPP facility with BNDES. PPP initiatives
Annex page 79

at the state level have been also supported by the Bank (in Minas Gerais and Siio Paulo).
Furthermore IFC committed a total of US$800 million in infrastructure for 15 projects (Andrade
Gutierres,CPFL, Macae, Tecon, UP offshore, Comgas, CGTF, Endesa, Enerbrasil, MRS, Suape
ICT, TAM, GOL) covering sectors such as transport and logistics (ports and air), the power
sector, as well as water and waste management.
Challenges and gaps. The achievements mentioned are modest compared with the
32.
magnitude of requirements. Weak regulatory capacity and contract renegotiation affect private
sector confidence. Poor conditions of ports constrain Brazil's increased integration into
international trade. Brazil's energy sector remains vulnerable to another "apagiio." While the
PPP legislation has created high expectations and may lead to greater private investment and
more efficient use of public funds, it is not without challenges and risks. The PPP framework
does not get around rigid fiscal constraints for public investment or improve the poor regulatory
framework. Moreover, PPPs have proven lengthy and cumbersome to prepare, and poor project
design and management capacity exacerbates this risk. Experience from other countries also
shows that PPPs have generated substantial fiscal risks. Beyond the PPP, a concerted effort is
needed to increase investment, both public - through more efficient public sector spending and
reduced budget rigidity (below) - and private - through improved independence of regulators
and reduced risks due to contract uncertainties.

8. Broader, more efficient financial sector
Achievements. There was modest progress during the CAS period, notably an important
33.
decline in both the SELIC interest rate (from 19.5 percent in mid- 1995 to 1 1.25 percent in
October 2007) and the spread (from 29 percent in 1995 to below 25 percent in August 2007).
There was also increased access to credit (including for housing) and important growth and
maturing of Brazil's capital markets. IFC has been very active in this sector helping broaden
access to finance and develop local capital markets. IFC's financial sector program amounted to
$1 billion over FY03-07, including financing raised from commercial banks. Most of the funds
were first raised on behalf of the country's large universal banks to reactivate trade lines. During
the past 2 fiscal years, and in light of the evolution of the Brazilian financial sector where tier I
banks have been assuming a more sustainable position IFC has been shifting its focus more to
mid size or tier I1 Brazilian banks.

34.
IFC continued worked with large banks and corporates to increase SMEs access to
finance. Examples include an SME financing line to Odebrecht, a large construction company
that relies on an extensive SME network. IFC also extended a credit line to ABN AMRO Banco
Real with proceeds to be on lent to middle market companies willing to improve their corporate
governance and focusing on renewable energy, energy efficiency, ecotourism and sustainable
agriculture. Both lines were associated with a TA component to support the companyhank and
the SMEs on key areas, e.g. corporate governance or information on markets.
35.
IFC also developed its housing finance starting with two securitization projects
(CIBRASEC - IFC's first equity operation involving a Brazilian securitization company and
IFC's first investment targeted specifically towards Brazil's housing finance markets; and a
second equity investment with GMAC-Residential Funding Corporation in Rio Bravo
Securitizadora.
36.
Challenges and gaps. While progress has been made during the CAS period,
achievements are modest. The high cost of borrowing remains a damper on investment and
Annex page 80

growth, holding back both enterprise development (SMEs are particularly credit constrained) and
consumer spending. SMEs are particularly credit constrained (and the large corporate sector less
so), implying the high interest rate also negatively affects equity as well as blocking formality.
9. Improved investment climate, competition and innovation policy
Achievements. An improved investment climate is essential for attracting private
37.
investment and for discouraging informality. Innovation policy is key to improving productivity
and competitiveness. During the CAS period, progress was limited. Total investment as percent
of GDP has stagnated around 19 percent. Brazil's rank in the World Competitiveness Scorecard
worsened from 37 in 2002 to 52 in 2005 (out of average 60 countries). The IFC has been heavily
involved in drilling down the doing business indicators to specific municipalities and to working
with governments to improve performance. In the CAS period Ceara and Minas Gerais made
major innovations, with Bank support, in moving towards results-oriented public sector
management. Their well-publicized achievements are influencing the programs of many other
state governments. A major AAA on innovation has been well received and will be followed up
with drill-downs in selected states.
Challenges and gaps. The major challenge in this area remains modernization of the
38.
legal and regulatory Eramework, and the development and adoption of a wide range of public
sector management reforms at the Federal, State and municipal levels.

D. Macro Foundations
In the last several years Brazil has achieved substantial success in consolidating
39.
economic stabilization and the institutions for credible economic management. The CAS
identified three areas as particularly important: (a) continuing and consolidating fiscal reform,
(b) increasing public sector efficiency, and (c) enhancing

10. Sound macroeconomic management and fiscal reform
40. Achievements. The hallmarks of sound macroeconomic management included fiscal
discipline (primary fiscal surpluses exceeding the 3.8 percent of GDP target), and adherence to
the inflation targeting and flexible exchange rate regimes. Net public debt as a share of GDP fell
from 50 percent to just over 45 percent (using the new GDP figures), and foreign-exchange
indexed debt was reduced essentially to zero. Inflation fell from 12.5 percent in 2002 to 4.5
percent in December 2007. There has been gradual progress in reform of the pension system.
The application of the FRL has led to major improvements in the fiscal condition of the states, as
Annex page 8 1

,

shown above.
Reserves have grown rapidly in the past year, with Brazil now having, for the first time in
decades, adequate reserves (sufficient to cover 18 months of imports and 280 percent of shortterm external debt).

41.
Challenges and gaps. The expensive social security system (which accounts for about
12 percent of GDP, and has deficits of around 6 percent of GDP) continues to present risks to
medium- and long-term stability. State public pension systems face similar challenges.
11. More efficient public expenditure management
42.
Achievements. Having established credibility for tight fiscal management, the
Government has turned its attention to measures to improve the quality of public spending.
There is widely-shared recognition that more efficient public expenditure management is critical
to Brazil's long-term fiscal sustainability. Fiscal adjustment has been accomplished with
revenue increases and public investment compression. With a tax burden of 34 percent of GDP
in 2006 and federal government investment around 0.65 percent of GDP, there is limited scope
for further adjustment using these methods - which already contribute to dampening private
investment.
Brazil's extreme budget rigidity (mandatory expenditures and excessive
earmarking) makes cuts in current expenditures very difficult. Sustained improvements in
expenditure quality require better knowledge about the quality of the current composition and
management of the public expenditures, development and institutionalization of sound public
expenditure management practices and removal or alleviation of certain structural budget
rigidities. The picture is similar at the state level.
43.
Challenges and gaps. The quality and efficiency of public spending continue to be
key priorities in the near term, while budget rigidity is a priority in the longer term. Scaling up
the procurement innovations (at federal level across
ministries) and in the states is likely to have substantial
I
impact.

VI. Bank Performance

44.
CAS design. The CAS was well-aligned with
PPA, highly participatory, and informed by an ambitious
set of Policy Notes. In this sense it well captured
Brazil's priorities, and on the whole focused on goals
and outcomes where the Bank had comparative
advantage in providing assistance. These goals did not
change over the CAS period. Two observations are relevant in retrospect regarding CAS design.
First, the CAS was ambitious, leading to a more dispersed overall Bank effort than perhaps could
have been the case. As demonstrated in several areas (e.g., social assistance, environmental
management), Bank assistance can have great impact when a well-crafted, mutually-reinforcing
mix of instruments is used to assist in a high priority area. A number of CAS goals -- while
important to Brazil -- may not be the Bank's strongest area of comparative advantage (e.g.,
CUM).
Moreover, there are CAS goals which, while essential to Brazil's macroeconomic
stability, for example, no longer require Bank involvement (e.g., debt management). Beyond these
examples, however, there is scope for greater strategic focus in CAS design. Second, among the
most cfifical gaps in CAS implementation over the last four years was insufficient attention to
public sector management. This may have been in part due to CAS design. While the public
Annex page 82

~

sector modernization and governance agenda was captured in the FY04-7 CAS within
macroeconomic foundations, it seems to have become absorbed in the larger goals. This is a core
of Bank comparative advantage. Given its overwhelming importance in Brazil, these issues
deserve substantially bolder Bank attention that they received during the CAS period.
Lending. Actual lending in FY04-07 is likely to be just over US$5 billion (short of the
anticipated US$7.5 billion). Consistent with the Government needs and CAS intentions, most
lending has been to the Federal Government, with about 60 percent in the form of DPLs and 25
percent SWAps. Total SIL lending (federal and state) fell in this CAS period to half the previous
CAS period level - an average of US$200 million per year in SIL lending (from an average of
US$400 million per year in the previous CAS). Most (80 percent) of this smaller SIL lending
volume was to sub-nationals governments, mainly states. However, the key factor in lending
during the CAS was a shifting financial context for the Bank's partnership with Brazil. At the
outset of the CAS, the government's financing needs and tight fiscal space led to a request for a
high lending envelope, a large share of which was quick-disbursing. This was appropriate in the
context of Brazil's low level of foreign reserves and multi-faceted reform and investment
programs which could be supported by DPLs and SWAps. With reduced financing requirements
based on strong external performance, at the end of the CAS period the government has
requested a substantially lower lending envelope (up to $1 billion per year, half of which federal
and half sub-national), limited need for DPLs and reduced need for SWAps. Overall, the
predominant trend during the CAS period was decreasing demand for funds at the federal level,
increasing demand from sub-nationals, and decreasing average loan size. Thus a key challenge,
as the present CAS closes, is maintaining the strong collaboration at the federal level in the
context of limited demand for borrowing, while building on opportunities to work with nonfederal clients in a responsive - but responsible - manner.
45.

46.
DPLs. There is a good case to be made that the one-tranche, flexible programmatic
pillar-by-pillar DPL model in the Brazil program has been successful. DPLs supported an
existing government reform program, with an associated TA loan that provided funding and
expertise to design subsequent stages, and to assist with monitoring and evaluation. The
programs supported in particularly by the HD DPL, the Growth DPL, and the Environment DPL
have had high impact far beyond the funding by supporting key government actions, protecting
budgets and providing TA and policy dialogue, as well as partnership. The challenge will be
keeping the policy dialogue represented in the DPL alive with little or no DPL lending. SWAps
and TALs will in this sense likely become potentially more important vehicles.
47.
SWAps. Experience also shows that although the government did not take as many
SWAps as planned, the "Brazil SWAP," an instrument tailor-made to Brazil's needs, builds on
country programs and systems, has been highly effective both in terms of improving the quality
of programs (through performance-linked disbursement), as well as ensuring that funds flow
more efficiently. The Brazil SWAP has evolved from Family Heath, through Bolsa Family, to its
innovative use in Ceara. The SWAP has proved a flexible and responsive instrument with
enormous potential. SWAps in the smaller volumes the government foresees could conceivably
be designed to support follow up of the DPL reform agenda in some cases.
48.
TALs. Programmatic TALs such as those underway in each pillar area have been on the
whole highly effective. However, TALs have been cumbersome to prepare and approve (e.g.,
the multiple ministries involved in the Growth TAL) and often slow to. Nevertheless, TALs
have been among the highest impact operations supported by the Bank (e.g., the series of pension

Annex page 83

TALs, and the Energy Sector TAL). It is well worth the investment in time to find the
appropriate means to ensure its efficiency as a lending vehicle.
49.
AAA. The Bank was involved with a number of important innovative studies during the
CAS period. Some examples include (a) the programmatic AAA on Brazil's Social Assistance
(the "BRASA" Program), a multi-year program of AAA that provided the technical
underpinnings for the Bank's support to the Bolsa Farnilia Program in the areas of program
design, targeting, and monitoring and evaluation; and (b) two seminal studies in health - the
study of "Governance in Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) (Report No. 3660 1-BR, February
2007) and "In Search of Excellence: Raising Hospital Performance in Brazil," which have both
served as central inputs to the dialogue on health sector reforms and have had substantial
coverage in the media. When well-disseminated, Bank supported ESW has had substantial
impact, with the potential to provide precisely the type of "Bank value" the government is
seeking. One of the lessons coming from QAG, however, is that AAA has been somewhat
dispersed and rather poorly disseminated.
50.

States. The present CAS set out an explicit framework for lending to states, consisting of
selection criteria for state lending, a model favoring sectoral integration (in particular
emphasizing "horizontal" support to public sector management), and special focus (agreed with
the federal treasury) on states that were "turning the corner" fiscally. In practice, state lending
criteria were not as important in choice of state loans as opportunism during the CAS period.
The integrated design was also applied selectively. The focus on fiscal reformers, however, can
be tentatively considered a successful approach. A DPL supporting the ambitious "Choque de
Gestao" public sector modernization in Minas Gerais, and a SWAP supporting Cearh's
comprehensive sectoral program have both been considered high impact operations, with
replication being considered in other states. Both projects supported dynamic, proactive state
teams that had defined innovative, well-tailored reform programs. This is a good example of
how Bank support can help scale-up successful state-led reforms. With the improved
creditworthiness of states, they represent an increasingly important client group for Bank
assistance.
51.

Municipalities. As part of the CAS, the Bank team laid out an explicit strategy for
working with municipalities. Letters offering support were sent out by the Bank to all 5000
mayors. This led to an important conflict with the Ministry of Finance, which perceived this to
be an attempt to "stimulate borrowing" and implicitly to undermine the FRL. The result was
unsatisfactory for all concerned. For the municipalities because only few projects actually were
prepared; for the Ministry of Finance, which had to say "no" to mayors who claimed they had
Bank support, and to the Bank because this portfolio was characterized by many false starts and
very long and uncertain approval processes. In the latter part of the CAS period the Bank agreed
to stop preparing new municipal projects until there was a clear Federal framework for such
engagement. By the end of the CAS period there was still no such framework. In a few cases where there are de facto consortia of municipalities, where there are compelling broader
development needs (such as around Brazil's premier port of Santos) and where municipalities
have capacity to borrow, the Finance Ministry has authorized, and encouraged, the Bank to
proceed.

Portfolio. Over the last decade, the Brazil portfolio - at US$4-5 billion (get correct
number) in commitments in 50 to 55 projects - has been one of the largest in the Bank. At the
outset of the CAS period, the slow disbursement of the program was considered its most serious
problem. SWAps were seen as a key way of improving disbursement performance. This has
Annex page 84

52.

been borne out, as the disbursement ratio has improved rather spectacularly, from 17 percent in
2004 (one of the Bank's poorest) to 40 percent in 2006 (one of the Bank's best). Perhaps more
fundamental, however, for most of this period three rather intractable implementation issues have
plagued the program, at both federal and sub-national level. These problems - weak institutional
capacity, delays in financial flows due to Brazil's rigid budget implementation rules, and
contracting difficulties - are reflective of core public sector management weakness in Brazil.
These three issues are also precisely those raised in the PPA evaluation (above) as interfering
with the effective implementation of government programs. As with the PPA, these problems serious as they are - have not prevented successful outcomes. As evidence, OED's rating of the
Bank-financed projects in Brazil found only 8 percent of projects to be unsuccessful. However,
these issues have led to costly delays and suboptimal implementation. At the start of the CAS
period, the portfolio had a relatively high problem project status, which has declined during the
CAS period (from 17 percent of total amount to 2 percent). However the at-risk portfolio is
probably a more accurate measure of actual difficulty, and this has evolved little over the CAS
period (from 17 percent to 15 percent), indicating that Brazil's core public sector management
weaknesses continue to substantially impede smooth project implementation. Improved
portfolio performance - for the Bank, as well as for the government's PPA - depends on
improved public sector management.

53. Results framework. The FY04-07 CAS was a pilot results-based CAS, under which a
preliminary framework for monitoring and evaluation of outcomes was developed, with
acknowledgement that it would require refinement over time. After four years of experience, the
following lessons have been learned:
The long-term indicators important measures of Brazil's development and influence the
selection of priorities in a CAS. But they little practical meaning in implementing and
assessing a program which contributes less than $2 billion a year to a $1000 billion
economy.
Medium term outcomes were at times imprecise catch-alls, oriented to including the
existing lending program (e.g., developing urban and rural strategies). Moreover, the
outcome indicators selected in a majority of cases were not relevant or really
monitorable.
Periodic monitoring of overall indicators did not take place, in large part because it was
not seen as relevant to the Bank's program.
Where monitoring did work, and was very effective, was when Bank-supported programs
were specifically results-oriented, and where borrower and Bank teams worked
intensively to assess what had been achieved and what needed to be done in order to
achieve better outcomes. At this level the Bank focus on results was appropriate,
practical and very valuable.
54.
Field presence. The Bank substantially decentralized its physical presence with the
FY00-03 CAS, and this was enhanced with the FY04-07 CAS. Given the government's request
for scaled-up assistance, this was a sensible and appropriate business decision. During the CAS
period, as the government demand for more focused, less dispersed assistance became clear, a
number of changes in the structure of Bank support were taken. A number of partnership
initiatives that began with the present CAS (e.g., Muninet, Rede Nos, GDLN) have now been
"spun off." The Fortaleza office has been closed, and the Recife office will be closed soon (as it
becomes clear that the vital and priority northeast program can be best supported by full-service
teams in Brasilia and Washington).

Annex page 85

55.
IFC - During this CAS period IFC committed an average of US500 million per fiscal
year, including financing raised from participating banks. As of June 30,2007, Brazil was IFC's
fourth largest country exposure after Russia, India and China. Disbursed and committed
portfolios far IFC's own account totaled US$1,284 million and US$1,618 respectively.
Syndicated loans (B loans) for which IFC is lender of record amounted to US446 million as of
the same date. Together with its investment, IFC also developed an active advisory program
supporting investment projects notably on sustainability standards, infrastructure and the
development of PPPs, and the business environment. IFC's field presence increased more than
two folds through its S2o Paulo ofice and its regional hub in Rio de Janeiro, notably in
idiastructure, global manufacturing, agribusiness, and global finance.

VII. Client Feedback
56.
In 2006 the Brazil office contracted a survey of the effectiveness and appropriateness of
Bank support, to which over 400 Bank clients and partners responded. A further survey was
undertaken to assess the impacts of the leadership crisis in the Bank in 2007. And extensive
consultations undertaken as part of the new Country Partnership Strategy also elicited comments
on the Bank in Brazil. The main conclusions emerging include:

a

The relationship between Brazil and the Bank is very strong and deep and unaffected by
the 2007 leadership crisis in the Bank.
The Bank is widely perceived to be highly professional and impartial. The Bank's "seal
of approval" is of very high value to clients.
The Bank's large field presence makes a huge difference in terms of ability to respond
quickly and with a good and constantly updated response to often rapidly changing
circumstances.
The Bank has been characterized as neither simply a lending institution nor a knowledge
institution. Its trademark and comparative advantage, instead, is that of a "learning
institution", which engages in practical challenges and brings development solutions
which are tailored to specific circumstances.
The Bank's global knowledge, especially on "how" rather than "what" issues is highly
valued.
The Bank is seen as being overly risk-averse, and unwilling to engage in several of the
complex, controversial development challenges that Brazil faces. One example has been
the reluctance of the Bank to deal with the complex challenge of reconciling conservation
and development in the Amazon, preferring to engage only in the conservation side of the
equation.
As global issues (such as climate change) emerge as major challenges, the Bank has been
perceived as overly driven by the agenda of the developed world. There is a broadlyperceived need for the Bank to help "level the playing field" on global issues (including
climate change and trade).
The Bank has not been an effective partner on regional issues.
While the Bank has been very innovative in developing new instruments (including
results-based SWAPS and DPLs), the bread-and-butter work of the Bank remains highly
bureaucratic, rule-bound and cumbersome.
The Bank and IFC are perceived to be quite separate institutions, marching to different
drummers.
Annex page 86

VIII. Conclusions
In conclusion, Brazil has come a long way toward achieving its development goals, at
least as they were represented in the Bank's CAS. It remained in the high performance case
throughout the CAS period. It has outperformed expectations in several very important areas -poverty reduction and fiscal discipline, and aspects of environmental ~~stainability.It has also
had more disappointing results in other areas, notably growth, infrastructure, public sector
management and the quality of spending.
57.

Bank has played an effective overall role as a supportive partner, adding its credibility at
58.
critical times and to critical programs. The Bank was not able to lend the full high case amount,
due in the first years of the CAS largely due to absorption capacity and in the last year due to the
government's reduced financing needs. Regardless of financing amount, there are key areas
where the Bank could perhaps have done more, and clear areas where the future challenges lie.

Annex page 87

CAS Completion Report Annex - Detailed Outcome-by-Outcome Assessment

The FY04-07 CAS outlined a program that was among the Bank's largest (up to US$7.5
billion in lending over four years), broadest (touching on virtually every aspect of economic and
social development) and "deepest" (active at federal, state and municipal levels). So results
assessment is lengthier than a country where Bank support was more confined. Moreover,
meaningful progress toward development goals takes time, and achievements should be seen
within this context. The following sections assess Brazil's progress and the Bank's role in the
FY04-07 "time slice."
A. A More Equitable Brazil
Overview. Brazil made remarkable gains in reducing inequality over the last four
years. As detailed below, substantial progress was made in each of three goal areas defined in
the CAS: (i) reduced poverty, vulnerability and exclusion, (ii) better knowledge and skills and
(iii) longer, healthier lives. In the context of strong government commitment, good
analytical underpinnings, TA and proactivity, Bank impact was high. Support was
relevant, timely and often catalytic. The lead instrument for Bank assistance was the
Programmatic Human Development Reform Loan Series (US$505.05 million, FY03), which
supported improved accountability, quality and targeting of social policies and programs,
protected of 21 core social program budgets during a vulnerable period at the outset of the new
administration, and secured commitment of the government to continued policy improvements.
The Human Development Technical Assistance Loan (US$8 million, FY06) helps develop
institutional capacity to monitor progress and impact of social polices and programs, building a
results-culture in the agencies it supports.

1. Reduced poverty, vulnerability and exclusion
Achievements. The poorest Brazilians are better off and less vulnerable than they were
four years ago. The latest national household survey (PNAD) data demonstrate Brazil's incomeinequality is finally eroding: the Gini coefficient (for decades stable at 0.60, among the highest in
the world) fell to 0.57 in 2005. Overall poverty has declined from 34 percent of the population
in 2003 to 29 percent in 2005, while extreme poverty fell from 15 percent to 11 percent (halving
the 1990 rate, and providing Brazil with early achievement of this MDG). These gains have
come about because of higher economic growth in the poorer North and Northeast and welltargeted conditional cash transfer programs. Increases in real labor income were also important,
and were due to price stability (inflation is at its lowest rate in decades), increases in the
minimum wage, and fuller employment (the jobless rate fell from over 12 percent in 2003 to 10
percent in 2006). The five intermediate outcome areas targeted at the outset of the CAS were:
Better coordinated, targeted and monitored social safety net. In 2003 Brazil's
patchwork of social assistance benefits was unified into a consolidated cash-transfer for
low-income families under the "Bolsa Familia" program in the Ministry of Social
Development (MDS). By the end of 2006, the program was providing cash transfers conditioned on children's school attendance and regular health visits - to 46 million
people, covering close to 90 percent of the nation's poor. The program has already
demonstrated impressively strong results. International evidence suggests that it is the
best targeted program in LAC, with 94 percent of benefits accruing to those in the poorest
two quintiles of the population. The program has also had a significant impact on
poverty and inequality: Bolsa Familia transfers explain 25 percent and 18 percent
Annex page 88

respectively of the reduction in extreme poverty and inequality in Brazil from 2001 to
2006. The World Bank has been involved in the design and refinement of the BFP from
the outset in 2003, through an integrated package of Programmatic AAA and lending. In
2004, Government sought the Bank's participation through a combination of technical
support and a direct partnership on the program. Building on our on-going "BRASA"
(Brazil Social Assistance) AAA program, the Bank supported the BFP through a direct
partnership with the Government of US$572.2 million. This partnership represented an
innovation in the way the Bank did business with this important MIC partner, and was
formalized through a "SWAP" operation in which the Government pre-financed programrelated expenditures, with the Bank reimbursing a small share of these outlays (less than
10 percent). The IDB also provided US$l billion in financing for Bolsa Familia via a
SWAP instrument (modeled on the Bank's).

Bank impact has been high. Tlze lending operation, sector work and activities under the HD
TAL were mutually reinforcing and helped contribute to the program success. One assessment
found approximately 20 percent of tlze impact of poverty declines in tlte last years to have
come from tlze Bolsa Familia program. Tlze largest conditional cash-transfer program in tlze
world, it has sewed as a model for other countries. The SWAP was designed to be
performance oriented and (responding to a specinl request of the government) to reimburse
directly to the federal treasury for expenditures incurred, thereby increasing budget flexibility
and advancing the SWAP design model (below).
Decreased vulnerability for poorest households, in particular in the Northeast. After
decades of stagnation, the ratio of GDP per capita in the Northeast as a share of the Brazil
total has improved (from 0.47 at the outset of the CAS to 0.51 in 2005). Service deficits
have narrowed, with an additional 40 percent of poor rural households gaining access to
safe water and electricity between 2003 and 2006. Over the last two CAS periods the
Bank targeted a large share of its assistance (both federal and sub-national) to the
Northeast. The large Rural Poverty Alleviation portfolio (16 projects and US$680
million in commitments under implementation during the CAS period, one the Bank's
largest programs in Brazil) provided a substantial share of new water and electricity
connections, often at lower cost than normal programs. Assistance to improved water
resource management, education and health (below) were also among core activities in
the Northeast.

Bank impact in tlte Northeast has been substantial. Over one-third of Bank lending has been
provided to tlte Northeast. A number of evaluations suggest tlze community-based projects
have Itad an important impact on basic services and health, with reductions in infant mortality
and water-borne disease; a large mnjority of projects have been found running 3-5 years after
closing. (However, productive subprojects have been less successful; new models (e.g., based
on better targeting of marketsfor products) are being developed.) More broadly, tlze Nortlzeast
strategy can be considered an effective strategic choice.
Decreased wage, service gap of women, indigenous populations. The gender gap in
terms of economic opportunity seems to be narrowing, with the wage differential for
women improved (to 82 percent of men's salaries in 2005), and demand for universitygraduate jobs higher for women. Nevertheless, women remain at a substantial
disadvantage. There is also some evidence for improved services for indigenous
populations, e.g., in the context of health care outcomes. A number of Bank-supported

Annex page 89

initiatives contributed modestly, including the VIGISUS I1 program, under which the
health of indigenous populations is improving (below), and the Northeast Rural Poverty
Alleviation Projects through which women have become increasingly active in
community associations.

It is not generally perceived that this is an area of Bank comparative advantage and therefore
there was little demandfor Bank support and little Bank impact.
Reduced youth unemployment. While overall unemployment has fallen, the percentage
of youth (ages 16-24) without jobs is high and has increased slightly (from 18 percent at
the outset of the CAS to over 19 percent in 2006). Today, nearly half the unemployed in
Brazil are youth. The government prioritized youth employment with its "Primeiro
Emprego" program, which paid small stipends for companies to hire youth, and
organized vocational training. The Bank provided policy advice to help improve the
program's efficiency at its outset, prepared an ESW Youth at Risk (FY05), and discussed
a possible loan to support the program (which was however not pursued). The Primeiro
Emprego program has benefited hundreds of thousands of youth over the last three years;
however, this is many fewer than planned.
Despite investment in sector work, dialogue and project preparation, there has not been
demandfor increased Bank engagement. The Bank has thus had little impact.
Culture valued and employed as an asset. The government has proactively promoted
Brazilian culture, identity, and patrimony (as one example, Brazil is now ranked among
the world's top ten international tourist destinations due to its natural and cultural
diversity.) The Bank did not pursue tourism components in state loans, as foreseen in the
CAS, however did support preparation of legislative changes facilitating land
regularization for Brazil's "quilombolas"(descendents of freed slaves) through an IDF
grant. Brazilian historic monuments have been the object of investment under an IDB
project.
A core priority under the PPA, this is an area where the ZDB has developed a strong brand
presence and where it is the IF1 of choice. The Bank did engage in this area support this goal
area as a major objective, thus impact has been low.

Challenges and gaps. In this overall highly positive picture, a key challenge is moving
the equity agenda from temporary transfers to sustainable solutions in the context of
employment and making the needed link with growth. Shifting the equity focus regionally is
also a relevant challenge; with notable progress in the Northeast, there is justification for the
Bank's continued shifting of equity focus to the North. It may be worth examining whether
culture, gender and indigenous populations -- important as they are -- are appropriate core CAS
goals for Bank support.

2. Better knowledge and skills
Achievements. Continued progress was made in education. Long-term indicators of
performance have improved, if slowly. Primary enrollment increased slightly (and the MDG
target of 100 percent for 2015 is feasible). Net secondary enrollment increased more
substantially from 36 percent to 46 percent (meeting the PPA target) but remains low overall.
Annex page 90

The girl-to-boy literacy ratio is now at parity (from 1.03 at the outset of the CAS) and adult
literacy has increased. The CAS set three outcomes to which Bank support would contribute:
Improved access and quality of early childhood programs. As of the outset of the
CAS early childhood development (ECD) programs had been successful in a number of
large cities. The government placed high value on scaling up successful models to
smaller cities (where capacity was lower); however, lacked the institutional and financial
framework. Rio de Janeiro's "Crianqa Maravilhosa" was chosen for scaling up with
Bank assistance, and a possible multi-city program planned thereafter. The Bank had
substantial involvement in designing this project, but the loan did not move forward due
to financiallfiscal issues that have prevented Rio municipality from borrowing.
Financing for early childhood programs was added to the new education funding
legislation (below) supported under the first HD DPL.

Despite sector work, substantial involvement in project design, the Bank's formal impact Itas
been low. One of the core implementation issues in Brazil Itas been the fiscal situation of
sub-national borrowers (below).
Improved quality of fundamental education. With near full-enrollment in basic
education, the challenge for Brazil, highlighted in the CAE and elsewhere, has been to
improve the quality of fundamental education. During the CAS period, the autonomy of
schools at the primary level (ages 6 to 14) was strengthened through the continued direct
transfer of resources under the FUNDEF sector financing and institutional model. As
strategic planning and resource management have become more institutionalized, schools
have improved their performance in these areas. Bank AAA has been enormously
influential. The Bank supported the FUNDESCOLA IIIA - Third School Improvement
Project (US$232.18 million, FY02), the first HD DPL and
Consistent with a CAS
orientation to prioritize development in the Northeast, these actions were also supported
by the Bahia Education Pro-iect (APL) - Second Phase (US$60 million, FY03) and the
Ceara Basic Education Quality Improvement Pro-iect (US$90.25 million, FYOI).

m.

Building on more than a decade of successful support improving fundamental education, the
Bank continues to have substantial impact though its mix of sector work, lending and TA.
Enhanced quality of secondary education. Legislation passed in 2006 has extended
and expanded the successful FUNDEF model to its successor, FUNDEB. FUNDEB
directs a greater share of earmarked sub-national government resources to education,
expanding it to include ECD, secondary and adult education, in addition to primary
education. The new FUNDEB recognizes
the need for re-focus of education resources to
preschoolers and youth, and to increase Brazil's levels of secondary education
participation. The culture of evaluation (through national testing) was also strengthened.
Many states have also developed their own student assessment systems to complement
the federal effort. The Bank supported these initiatives through the first HD DPL and

m.

Tite Bank ltas played an effective role in particular in sector dialogue in enliancing focus on
secondary education.

3. Longer, healthier lives
Achievements. Brazil made good progress in health care. Long-term indicators showed
a trend toward better health outcomes: Infant mortality fell from 29 per 1,000 births to 24
(consistent with the PPA target, and within reach of the MDG goal of 16 by 2015), and maternal
mortality remained stable. New AIDS cases increased from 15.9 per 100,000 but only slightly,
and AIDS mortality has substantially declined. There were also important improvements in the
health of indigenous populations. Health care systems are becoming more efficient and better
managed. Three specific outcomes were determined to be high priority:
Reduced equity gap in health services. Over the CAS period family health coverage
was extended to 55 percent (from 50 percent) of the population, prioritizing low-income
communities. This was supported through the Family Health Extension Program (US$68
million, FY02). The health of Brazil's indigenous population (mainly located in the
Amazon region) improved (lower infant mortality, fuller immunization coverage), and
the federal agency in charge, FUNASA, has initiated the development of new models of
organization, financing, management, M&E and care for indigenous health. These
accomplishments were supported through the VIGISUS I1 - Disease Surveillance &
Control (US$99.5 million, FY04), a quarter of the spending for which was earmarked for
indigenous areas.

Bank impact lzas been high. The Family Health S WAp contributed to firzancing, improved
management and improved targeting of this core program. (As tlze first SWAP in Brazil it has
also had substantial impact on tlze design of other Bank projects.) In prioritizing indigenous
areas, the WGISUS 11 project has helped narrow heath service and outcome gaps for one of
Brazil's most excluded populations.
Higher quality of care, including AIDS prevention. Also with the support of
VIGISUS 11, Brazil's surveillance and disease prevention and control system in all 27
states and several hundred municipalities has become a model for developing countries.
Brazil's AIDS program, supported through Brazil AIDS and STD Control I11 Project
(US$100 million, FY03) had a significant impact on both attenuating the epidemic and
improving quality of life of people living with HIVIAIDS in Brazil. Testing for HIV
increased, condoms more widely accessible, and low-cost anti-retroviral treatment is
available to all AIDS patients. Civil society is deeply involved in human rights and
prevention activities. Brazil's AIDS program is considered in recent reviews to be
among the best in the world.

Bank impact lzas been substantial, over a decade of support to Brazil's successful AIDS
prevention and control program. Bank engagement in Brazil's AIDS program also has
important global learning and cross-fertilization benefits for other countries.
Increased accountability of health services. A results culture is developing in the
Ministry of Health, with transfer of funds to states and municipalities based on
performance (e.g., 244 municipalities had funding blocked for performance reasons in
2006). A bill has been prepared to grant autonomy to public facilities, and a facility
quality rating system established for family health units (consistent with
recommendations of the Hospital Performance AAA. These initiatives have been
supported by the HD DPL and

Bank's impact in healtlt quality and financing was substantial as tlte result in part of AAA
which were well disseminated.
A More Sustainable Brazil
Brazil took substantial steps to improvement environmental sustainability during
the period. As described below, initiatives were taken in each of three CAS goal areas: (i) more
equitable access to local services; (ii) better water quality and water resource management; and
(iii) improved forestry and biodiversity. As detailed below, access to housing and other services
has increased, water resources are being more efficiently managed and Brazil has made historic
strides in setting aside protected areas. The Bank played an important role in Brazil's gains,
effectively using AAA, TA, special grants and lending not only to support but proactively
catalyze progress. A pillar of the Bank's program was the Programmatic Reform Loan for
Environmental Sustainability ($501.2 million, FY05) supporting Brazil's goal of balancing
economic growth with social development, and mainstreaming environmental management in
seven line ministries. An accompanying Technical Assistance Loan (US$7.94 million, FY06)
supported, among other measures, restructuring of Brazil's Environment Ministry (MMA) and
its National Environment Institute (IBAMA) and simplified procedures for environmental
licensing. A second DPL is under preparation.

1. More equitable access to local services
Achievements. Progress in improving basic local services for those least served was
slow overall during the CAS period. The last several years saw approval of key new policy and
institutional measures, however, which should pave the way for more rapid progress in service
provision in the coming period. Three outcomes areas were established at the outset of the CAS:
Housing better targeted to the poorest and housing finance and land tenure reforms
undertaken. Reforms brought a shifting of housing program subsidies to lower income
families (from 45 percent to 65 percent of subsidies). Brazil's progressively lower base
interest rate (below) has attracted private banks to the housing sector, contributing to
increased availability of credit. The Bank was engaged in housing intensively through
the CAS period. The report Housing (title) was well disseminated and discussed in
Brazil. This helped pave the way for agreement on a program aimed at strengthening
policy and government institutional framework for the sector, increased stability and
scale of housing finance market, improved effectiveness and harmonization of housing
subsidies, and reforms in land and urban management, supported by the Programmatic
Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth: Supporting Housing; Sector Policy
(US$502.5 million, FY05).
Bank impact in ltousing was high. Analytical work was well disseminated in a context wltere
there was solid momentum and government commitment, and tlzis led to TA and lending
whiclz effectively supported progress. Tlze Bank's decision to engage in Izousing, and its
steady presence over the last several years, seem to have been sound.
Integrated program in place for investment in water and sanitation infrastructure.
A landmark federal water law was passed at the end of the CAS period, ending a
frustrating 15-year period of institutional stalemate and underinvestment. A consortia law

Annex page 93

(2006) allowing regional and inter-federal cooperation has helped also clarified
institutional responsibilities for the sector. The PPP law (see below) should facilitate
private sector investment. The population lacking safe water fell slightly (from 22
percent to 17 percent) over the CAS period and sewerage services improved slightly but
the results are distant from the MDG 2015 target of 20 percent. Active Bank lending was
largely limited to two technical assistance loans, the Water Sector Modernization Project
I1 - PMSS I1 (US$25 million, FY98) which supported development of the new water law
and Low Income Sanitation Technical Assistance Project - PROSANEAR I1 (US$23.9
million, FYOO) which developed participatory engineering designs for projects in lowincome areas.

The Bank's impact has been arguably high, altliouglr for unusual reasons. While tlte Bank
role during CAS was limited due to tlte institutional vacuum, its continued partnership and
teclinical advice helped design tlie new institutionalframework, and prepare operationallyfor
its implementation. This "low-case" involvement was of tremendous value and positions tlie
Bank to provide strong support in tlie coming period as investment picks up.
Sectorally integrated strategies for sustainable local rural and urban services. The
rural and urban spaces were both prioritized in the CAS because while most poverty is
rural, it is growing fastest in urban areas. With improving creditworthiness, participation
and maturity, Brazil's cities have increasingly sought more ambitious development plans.
Consistent with CAS objectives to expand work at the municipal level, the Bank
developed a strategy for support to cities, testing several approaches (i.e., direct lending
Integrated Municipal Project - Betim Municipality (US$24.08 million, FY05) and a
pooled-approach Horizontal Municipal APL, including Municipal APL: Uberaba
[US$17.27 million), Municipal APL: S5o Luis Enhancing Municipal Governance and
Quality of Life Proiect (US$35.64 million), Municipal APL: Recife (US$32.76),
Municipal APL: Belo Horizonte Urban Upgrading and Inclusion Proiect (US$31
million), and Municipal APL: Teresina Enhancing Municipal Governance and Quality of
Life Pro-iect (US$3 1.13 million)). For more than a decade the Bank has also supported an
urban transport strategy, including financing a large program of metro projects aimed at
reducing transport costs for the poorest, and reducing environmental externalities of
urban transport congestion. During the CAS period seven projects were active, and at
nearly US$900 million this has been by far the largest investment lending portfolio in the
program. Urban transport investments have helped decrease the average commuting time
for many low-income workers, but implementation has been tied up in political stalemate
that affected funding in several metropolitan regions.

Tlre Bank's impact in this area is mixed. First, in the rural space, the rural poverty projects
have successfully helped provide basic services to poor people. Tlre human and community
capital created has been effective in delivering other, non-Bank-funded services to these
communities. Second, tlze Bank's engagement with municipalities has been much less
effective than anticipated, in part due to the mismatch between tlze Bank's ambitions and the
hesitancy of the Federal Government to a110w municipal lending. In addition, tlte Bank's
municipal programs focused too heavily on specific investments and too little on the broader
cltallenges of improved management and equipping cities to become competitive. Third, the
urban transport strategy was based on decentralization of metro services from tlre federal to
state governments. This has only partially taken place. These major construction projects
have suffered heavily from stop-and-go institutional aridfinancial arrangements. In tlre latter
Annex page 94

part of the CAS project these constraints eased somewhat and considerable progress was
made.
Challenges and gaps. Service provision in both urban and rural areas remains a major
challenge in Brazil. The population without electricity in the North and Northeast remains high
(in particular in rural areas). Underinvestment in water and sanitation has actually increased the
service deficits for the poorest. (While it is promising that the government's new Growth
Acceleration Plan (PAC) includes substantial earmarked funding for water and sanitation, this
alone does not guarantee programs will be pursued.) While a number of the metro investment
programs have met with success, several others remain incomplete and the institutional/political
framework is arguably inadequate.
2.

Better water quality and water resource management

Achievements. There have been major gains in putting into place a modern set of water
resource management institutions, both at the Federal and State levels (especially in the
Northeast). The Bank played a major role in these successes.
More efficient water resource management, especially in the NE, and increased
number water basins with legal allocation of water rights. The important new
National Water Resources Management Plan, completed with support from the Env TAL,
was launched. Over 100 state river basin committees and seven federal basin committees
were established, and water rights for more than 95,000 parties were granted. As a result,
legal allocation of water rights now occurs in 23 percent of Brazil's main water basins
(up from 10 percent at the start of the CAS). Substantial underutilized water resource
conveyance infrastructure was more efficiently used with help from the additional
financing from Federal Water Resources Management Project - PROAGUA (US$50
million, FY07). As a result project, more reliable water supply has been provided to over
2 million people in the Northeast. PROAGUA has also helped establish economic
selection criteria for investments, which will be important in the context of new water
conveyance infrastructure planned under the PAC. WRM projects, including the Ceara
Integrated Water Resources Management Project (US$136 million, FYOO), GEF Caatinga
Conservation and Management - Mata Branca (US$lO million, FY07) and supported the
creation and strengthening of state WRM institutions, water user associations, basin
committees, state WRM councils and information systems.
Improved water quality, especially in the urban SE. Water quality is poor and
worsening, due principally to the institutional vacuum in the sector. In eleven of Brazil's
27 states less than half of the households have sewage disposal, and of those that do, 80
percent of the waste is sent directly into waterways with no treatment. Nevertheless,
there has been some progress, with the bulk water regulatory agency ANA taking a
dynamic role (e.g., preparing reports on surface water quality, improving certification of
its innovative wastewater treatment program). The federal government introduced water
extraction1 pollution charges in the Paraiba do Sul river basin in 2003, and Siio Paulo
State passed a water use/pollution charge law in 2006. The Bank is preparing with the
State and Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo, an ambitious programmatic approach to
improving water resources management and water quality in metropolitan Sao Paulo,
with the Billings watershed protection project, scheduled for FY08.
Annex page 95

Bank impact in the area of water resources management and water quality has been
substantial With the Bank playing a major role, it is now broadly accepted that effective water
management requires both investments in institutions and in infrastructure. This was due to a
close partnership and solid understanding of sectoral issue and the successful use of the full
range of lending and non-lending instruments at both the federal and state levels. Progress
was more rapid on water quantity issues in the Northeast than on the water quality issues in
the Southeast.
Challenges and gaps. Efficient use of scarce water resources will take on everincreasing importance in the Northeast region, as it continues economic growth. Water quality,
particularly in urban areas, is a tremendous and growing challenge and is likely to take on
increasing importance. Management of water resources in the hydro-rich basins of the Amazon
is a major challenge.
3. More sustainable land management, forestry and biodiversity

Achievements. Brazil substantially increased its share of land area under protection
(from 8 to 13 percent of total) and as indigenous lands (from 11-12 percent of total), and
evidence suggests deforestation rates have decreased markedly in the last two years. The Bank
supported three specific outcomes:

* More systematic land use zoning and enforcement. While improvement is needed in
both rural and urban areas throughout Brazil, the priority for land use zoning has been in
the Amazon region. All of the Amazon states have completed zoning exercises, which
built their geo-processing capabilities with support from the NRPP (PPG7 =ant) project.
However, in practice zoning enforcement has been extremely weak, and has not resisted
the strong "push" of transport, agriculture and resettlement. The federal and a number of
state governments have more recently shifted toward market-based approaches to
influencing land use, such as identifying key protected areas, land regularization, and
incentives for sustainable use. This approach has been used in state transport projects in
Tocantins and Goais, the NRPP, an Amazon cartomaphv proiect, the Para integrated
project, and sector work on land tenure in the Amazon.

Bank impact has been mked, but overall positive. While the Bank financed expensive zoning
systems that were poorly enforced, building on lessons learned (including through major
zoning efforts in Rondonia and Mato Grosso) it was able to shiff to a more pragmatic and
effective approach
Adoption of sustainable forest strategy (North and Mata Atlantica). Brazil has taken
key steps to build its forestry stewardship capacity. A national Forest Law and Mata
Atlantica Law were passed, and the Brazilian National Forest Service established. The
areas of certified forest management doubled over the period (now reaching nearly
400,000 ha). While the deforestation rate was higher in the period 2000-2005 than in the
previous decade, it decreased markedly after 2005, with the 2006 rate the lowest since the
early 1990s. There is some evidence to suggest Brazil's increased protected areas
(below) have contributed to this progress. A forest loan under discussion during the CAS
period has not yet come to fruition. The Environmental DPL and TAL supported drafting
of the National Forest Law. Bank ESW on agricultural expansion and deforestation has
been influential in Brazil.
Annex page 96

Bank impact in support of forest sustainability has been positive. Bank AAA lzas been
relevant and well disseminated, and the Env DPL and TAL have been effective velzicles for
policy support However, tlze fact tlzat a Japanese PHRD grant for project preparation had to
be cancelled (due to inadequate staffing), and the difficulties associated with the planned
Forestry loan suggest tlzat impact could have been greater.
Strategy for biodiversity conservation. Over the past four years Brazil set aside more
than 100 million hectares (with 173 million ha under some form of protection, the largest
protected are in the world). The institutions of environmental management, and interagency coordination, in the Amazon were strengthened. The Bank has played a
substantial role in these efforts, through the ARPA project [ A W A established 18 million
ha of newly protected areas in Amazon], the EnvDPL and
as well as helping build
regional capacity development under the NRPP (PPG7).

m,

The Bank's impact has been high. ARPA added a major portion of reserves to Brazil's
protected areas. In its contributions to biodiversity tlze Bank has successfully integrated a
number of instruments (building on tlze lessons of tlte PPG7 grant program, and GEFfinanced activities), and has been looked to by other partners to provide reliable policy
analysis and a forum for stakeltolder debate. There is important scope for increasing tlte
cohesiveness and synergies of PPG7, GEF, carbon fund and mainstream Bank activities in
other areas.
Challenges and gaps. The tension between development and sustainability is among the handful
of Brazil's most critical long-term challenges. Within the context of Brazil's increasingly
effective environmental management and leadership role internationally, improved land use and
its enforcement, including the complex issues surrounding agrarian reform and population
resettlement (a critical part of the PPA) are critical both from a social and environmental
perspective. A shortcoming of Bank engagement has been that the Bank has only just started to
couple its work on conservation (using trust funds and GEF) with approaches to dealing with the
major development challenges in the region (with the Para project and the IFC's Bertin projects
promising, recent exceptions).
A More Competitive Brazil
Brazil made measured advances on its growth agenda.. At the outset of the CAS period
the government defined a program of initiatives to improve growth potential and
competitiveness, including (a) improving infrastructure efficiency, quality and coverage, (b)
enhancing the efficiency and depth of the financial sector, and (c) increasing competition and
innovation capacity. The Bank deepened its support in these areas, compared with the
previous CAS period, and made good use in particular of TA and AAA. The Bank
supported this agenda through a Second Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable
Growth (US$601.5 million, FY06), and a Sustainable and Equitable Growth Technical
Assistance Program (FYUS$12.12 million, FY05). But the average growth rate in the period
2003-2006 was 2.6 percent (3 percent using new data), below the average for the region (4.5
percent) for emerging market economies (8-9 percent) and the PPA projection (5 percent).

Annex page 97

1. Improved infrastructure
Achievements. Brazil's infrastructure was ranked 7 1 among 125 countries -- lower than
most comparator. Improved infrastructure would both contribute to higher growth as well as to
improved living standards especially for the poorest. Public infrastructure investment as a share
of GDP has remained under 1 percent during the CAS period (and much of the last decade),
crowded out by large current expenditures and a rigid budget framework (below). One casualty
was the electric power sector's unusual vulnerability to drought, which caused the 2002
"apagiio," or brown-out. On the private sector side, regulatory uncertainty and contract
renegotiation are among the risks holding back investment. A landmark federal law regulating
public private partnerships (PPPs) was passed in 2005, and a first group of projects are being
prepared under this framework (largely in road transport). The Bank is supporting the
government's PPP unit through an IDF grant. PPP initiatives at the state level have been also
supported by the Bank (in Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo). In this goal area the CAS sought to
support two outcomes:
More modern infrastructure regulation and maintenance. Progress has been modest.
While Brazil has established 16 independent regulatory agencies, regulators complain of
government interference in their decisions and Brazil's regulatory effectiveness is ranked
55 (out of 125 countries), below the 47 average for the region.24 Improved efficiency and
effectiveness of these agencies (e.g., through a law on career development plans) is
supported by the Growth TAL. Output-based maintenance contracting now covers a
share of the most traveled federal highways, financed by the Federal Highway
Rehabilitation and Decentralization Project (US$248.96 million, FY97), state highway
projects in Tocantins (Tocantins Sustainable Regional Development Project - US$60
million, FY04), Goias (Goias State Highway Management Project - US$64.44 million,
FY02), and Bahia (Bahia Integrated State Highway Management Project - US$100
million, FY07), and a recently approved Brazil Road Transport Project (US$501.25
million, FY06). However the sector suffers from poor institutional capacity and
coordination, and inadequate investment planning, contracting, procurement and
management (below). In some instances TALs have been very effective in dealing with
controversial issues where Brazil has needed disinterested technical advice. An
important example is the Energy TAL, which was used very successfully to address
issues of cost, competition, bidding and sedimentation of the massive Rio Madeira
hydropower project.

Bank impact has been moderate. The Growth TAL in particular has helped the government
with concrete actions, and Bank AAA has been informative in diagnosing priorities. Use of
output-based maintenance contracts began with Bank-supported projects under the previous
CAS and expanded over the last four years particularly in the states where progress has been
more agile under the Bank-supported highway operations. Bank growth loan has not been
signed and amount has been reduced, indicating government does not value Bank for finance
(due to large C/A surplus) but rather as a technical partner. Build on this by making more
agile TA instrument, disseminate AAA effectively, since it is key. Link between infrastructure
and poverty could take more prominence in next CAS. Infrastructure for growth AAA should
also be well disseminated.

Lower logistics costs. Logistics costs have been an important element in the high "custo
brasil," or cost for private firms of doing business in Brazil. Improvements have been
made in customs effectiveness, with clearing system modernization resulting in reducing
release time for merchandise by 20 percent. Export procedures have also been
simplified.
Railway concessions were geographically restructured to facilitate
multimodal transport. These activities were supported by the Growth DPL and TAL.
Road conditions in a number of important states have been improved, facilitating
smoother transport. Port handling costs have been reduced and productivity of railway
operations increased. AAA on Brazil's largest port, at Santos (Sao Paulo), is likely to
contribute to further improvements in the port sector.
Bank impact has been moderate.

Tlte Growth TAL provided an effective demand-driven

Challenges and gaps. The achievements mentioned are modest compared with the
magnitude of requirements. Weak regulatory capacity and contract renegotiation affect private
sector confidence. Lack of modern cross-border links and poor conditions of ports constrain
Brazil's increased integration into international trade. Brazil's energy sector remains vulnerable
to another "apag20." While the PPP legislation has created high expectations and may lead to
greater private investment and more efficient use of public funds, it is not without challenges and
risks. The PPP framework does not get around rigid fiscal constraints for public investment or
improve the poor regulatory framework. Moreover, PPPs have proven lengthy and cumbersome
to prepare, and poor project design and management capacity exacerbates this risk. Experience
from other countries also shows that PPPs have generated substantial fiscal risks. Beyond the
PPP, a concerted effort is needed to increase investment, both public - through more efficient
public sector spending and reduced budget rigidity (below) - and private - through improved
independence of regulators and reduced risks due to contract uncertainties.

2. Broader, more efficient financial sector
Achievements. There was modest progress during the CAS period, with a decline in
interest rates for private sector companies and individuals, increased access to credit and growth
of Brazil's capital markets. Four outcome areas were supported by the CAS:
Lower interest rates for individuals and enterprises. The Central Bank reduced the
SELIC base rate from a peak of just under 20 percent in 2005 to just over 11 percent
currently, the SELIC's historic low. The spread over the SELIC also fell to below 25
percent, the lowest since 2001. Despite these positive developments, Brazil's interest
rates are among the highest in the world, and act a brake on access to credit in particular
for SMEs and individuals. A key development during the CAS period was passage of a
bankruptcy law, which will help contribute to lower spreads by reducing risks.
Tlte Bank's impact was limited, in an area that is determined by overall macroeconomic
policy. However, ESW on tlte cost of intermediation lzas provided critical insiglzts, helping to
"demystify" the issue of lziglz spreads in Brazil by calling attention to the SELIC as tlte
primary driver of both the interest rate and the spread, suggesting that macroeconomic
measures are more critical to the interest rate (at least at current levels) tltan microeconomic
factors suck as taxation, lzigh administrative and operational costs, lack of competition, and
contract enforcement weaknesses.

Annex page 99

Enhanced competition, lower directed credit. High returns on capital in the retail
banking market are indicative of limited competition, although returns are lower in the
corporate market suggesting greater competition. A banking sector bankruptcy law was
approved in February 2005 (Law No. 11.101) to increase competition. There has been
little change in directed credit allocations to agriculture, housing and other sectors, which
contribute to the high cost of borrowing.
The Bank's impact was limited Sector work on the banking industry market segments
however has been effective in helping identza the extent of competition, and has played a
useful role in diagnosis.
Increased private sector long-term finance. Brazil's capital markets have grown more
rapidly than those in the region over the last four years. But markets are dominated (80
percent of total) by government paper, and the stock market remains shallow. The
Financial Sector TA loan (US$18.1 million, FYOl), supported Brazil's Securities and
Exchange Commission (CVM) in improving its internal organization (protection for
minority retail investors, increasing transparency of operations) to adapt to new market
challenges. It also updates Brazilian capital markets norms to international standard, and
reinforces inspection and supervision capacity.
The Bank's impact has been more substantial, though the TAL should help deepen Brazil's
growing capital markets as a source of long-term finance. An agreement to do joint studies on
capital markets, which emergedfrom the TAL, is a promising development.
Increased access of poor to banking services. Overall bank credit volume increased, to
over 30 percent of GDP (from about 25 percent at the outset of the period). A large share
of the increase was in the retail market. Bank accounts also expanded during the CAS
period from 95 million to 140 million. Housing finance credit operations tripled in
volume. While these developments are indicative of greater individual access to credit, it
is not clear that this is in the poorest groups. Microcredit from the IFC and the Bank,
through the Crediamigo project (US$150 million, FYOO) has made modest contributions
to increasing access to credit for the poorest.
The Bank's impact has been modest in scale, but arguably effective, through work in the
housing sector (above), and micro-credit.
Challenges and gaps. While progress has been made during the CAS period,
achievements are modest. The high cost of borrowing remains a damper on investment and
growth, holding back both enterprise development (SMEs are particularly credit constrained) and
consumer spending. SMEs are particularly credit constrained (and the large corporate sector less
so), implying the high interest rate also negatively affects equity as well as blocking formality.
3. Improved investment climate, competition and innovation policy
Achievements. An improved investment climate is essential for attracting private
investmmt and for discouraging informality. Innovation policy is key to improving productivity
and competitiveness. During the CAS period, progress was limited. Total investment as percent
of GDP has stagnated around 19 percent. Brazil's rank in the World Competitiveness Scorecard
Annex page 100

worsened from 37 in 2002 to 52 in 2005 (out of 60 countries), though notably, Sao Paulo state
ranked 43. The CAS prioritized four outcome areas:
Clearer application of antitrust laws. A competition law has been before Congress for
some time and is not yet approved (it may be approved in the near term in the context of
the PAC legislation). However enforcement and institutional changes will be equally (if
not more) important than the enabling legislation.

The Bank's impact Izas been limited. The Growtlz TAL loan has provided support for the
competition law.
Simplified company registration and taxation. A new SME tax system law, National
SIMPLES, was passed in 2006 and promises to help curb informality in the coming
period. It simplifies SME taxation by combining the six federal taxes (previously unified
under SIMPLES) with the state income tax (ICMS) and a municipal tax (ISS). The new
law is expected to bring a 15-20 percent tax reduction to the two million firms that have
already adopted the SIMPLES and a 40-60 percent break to another 200,000 firms. While
this will decrease overall federal tax revenues, it is expected to bring three million firms
into the formal economy. There has also been some limited progress in company
registration processes, which have varied greatly by state.

The Bank has had modest but relevant impact. The ESW report Doing Business in Brazil
(2006) was well disseminated and effective. For example, in presenting S6o Paulo as an
outlier (tlze highest time to register a company in Brazil at 152 days), it led tlze state to seek
cooperation with the IFC on a reform plan.
Establishment of modern institutional, legal and financing framework for
innovation. A major step has been passage of a national innovation law in December
2004 (Law No. 10.977), which promotes collaboration between universities and public
research centers. However, Brazil's overall R&D remains at less than 1 percent of GDP,
and new patents and scientific papers from Brazilian inventor and academics have not
substantially increased. The Bank has done a major and very well-received report on the
barriers to innovation in Brazil. The report is now being drilled down in the states of
Minas Gerais and Acre.
More equitable access to higher education. Greater access and enrollment at the
university level is an important step to improving Brazil's innovation and
competitiveness. While a large program, PROUNI, to offer university spaces to poor
students was created, progress was very limited.

The Bank has had a limited impact. A lending operation in support of higher education has
been discussed, but the preconditions (government reform plan, understanding of sectoral
underpinnings) have not been present.
Challenges and gaps. Accomplishments were limited in this critical area, and the
challenge is renewed efforts in all of these areas, rather than any one particular gap. Among the
most critical areas continued sector work to understand the complex drivers and blockages to
growth.

Annex page 101

Macro Foundations
In the last several years Brazil has achieved substantial success in consolidating
economic stabilization and the institutions for credible economic management. The CAS
identified three areas as particularly important: (a) continuing and consolidating fiscal reform,
(b) increasing public sector efficiency, and (c) enhancing good governance. With the exception
of pensions, where Bank impact was high, the Bank had a limited role (including in public
sector management where it could have contributed more), thus its impact overall was
relatively low. As described below, fiscal management during the CAS period was remarkably
strong and effectively re-established market confidence, reducing vulnerability and the cost of
borrowing. Progress in public sector spending was not deemed sufficient to move forward with a
Fourth Programmatic Fiscal Reform Loan, a planned core pillar of Bank support.

1. Sound macroeconomic management and fiscal reform
Achievements. The hallmarks of sound macroeconomic management included fiscal
discipline (primary fiscal surpluses exceeding the 3.8 percent of GDP target), and adherence to
the inflation targeting and flexible exchange rate regimes. Inflation fell from 12.5 percent in
2002 to 4.5 percent December in 2007. Three specific outcomes were supported by the CAS:
Falling public debt and improved debt composition. The prudent fiscal stance,
exchange rate appreciation, and positive GDP growth led public debt to fall from 57
percent in 2002 to about 50 percent (this has subsequently been adjusted to 50.5 percent
and 44.9 percent using revised GDP figures). The share of domestic public debt due
within one year has improved from 43 percent to 23.5 percent, and foreign-exchange
indexed debt has fallen dramatically from to 35 percent in 2003 to essentially zero in
2007. Fixed bonds increased from 2 percent to 35 percent over the same period.

The Bank had a limited impact.
More fiscally sustainable social security system. With among the most generous
replacement rates in the world, Brazil's public pension system is an unsustainable fiscal
burden as currently structured. The system has been undergoing gradual reform since the
late 1990s. Constitutional Amendment 4 1, approved in 2003 reduces deficits in public
system, begins reform in private system, and strengthens pension supervision. The Bank
supported this program with a Third Fiscal Reform DPL (US$658 million, FY06). TA
loans at federal, state and municipal level (PARSEP 11, PREV-MUN and State Pension
LIL) helped redo registers of beneficiaries and implement administrative and IT
upgrades.

The Bank impact has been high. With very small amounts of funds TA operations have
brought large financial savings to the federal, state and municipal systems while helping
implement more efficient and modern practices. The Programmatic DPL has supported a
difficult set of reforms and serves as a vehiclefor continuing dialogue.
Increased openness of the economy. Brazil's strong external sector performance has
reduced vulnerability. Exports more than doubled from 2002 to 2006 (reaching US$140
billion), benefiting from high commodity prices and exchange rate flexibility. The
Brazilian trade balance more that tripled from US$13 billion in 2002 to US$46 billion in

Annex page 102

2006. After more than a decade of deficits, Brazil had a current account surplus of 1.4
percent of GDP in 2006, and international reserves reached almost US$163 billion in
September 2007 (18 months of imports), an historic peak. This has supported an
appreciation of the nominal exchange rate from just below R$4/US$ in 2002 to well
below R$2/US$ currently. The growing strength of Brazil's external position allowed it
to make an early repayment of its entire outstanding obligations to the IMF (2005), the
Paris Club (2006), and retire its Brady Bonds (2006).

The Bank impact lzas been limited. While logistics reforms and measures under the Growtlr
DPL and TAL contribute substantially to economic openness, progress was limited and Bank
impact as well.
Challenges and gaps. Brazil's macroeconomic performance has been strong, with
impressive performance in reducing external vulnerability. The expensive social security system
continues to present risks to fiscal stability, however, and modest reform efforts may continue,
including at the level of state public pension systems.

2. More efficient public expenditure management
Achievements. The Government increasingly has turned its attention to measures to
improve the quality of public spending. There is widely-shared recognition that more efficient
public expenditure management is critical to Brazil's long-term fiscal sustainability. Fiscal
adjustment has been accomplished with revenue increases and public investment compression.
With a tax burden of 36 percent of GDP in 2006 (33 percent using the new GDP estimates), and
federal government investment around 0.5 of percent of GDP (0.4 percent using the new GDP
estimates), there is limited scope for further adjustment using these methods - which already
contribute to dampening private investment. Brazil's extreme budget rigidity (mandatory
expenditures and excessive earmarking) makes cuts in current expenditures very difficult.
Sustained improvements in expenditure quality require better knowledge about the quality of the
current composition and management of the public expenditures, development and
institutionalization of sound public expenditure management practices and removal or alleviation
of certain structural budget rigidities. The picture is similar at the state level.
Reduced budget rigidity, reallocation for more public investment. Constitutional and
other legally mandated earmarking to protect social and other programs, along with the
goal of substantial primary fiscal surpluses, have limited the Government's budgetary
flexibility. Public investment, in particular in infrastructure, has been crowded out as a
consequence. There was little policy movement during the CAS period to alleviate this
constraint. But the government actively pursued other initiatives to compensate for this
fiscal straightjacket. In 2005, a pilot program on fiscal space for public investments was
launched, with the assistance of the IMF, to explore ways to increase public investment
expenditures with high economic returns (prioritizing those demonstrably leading to
growth and improved debt sustainability). The result was that key infrastructure
investment projects are excluded from the annual fiscal targets for the period 2005-2007.
These investment projects will be monitored and subject to strict evaluation processes to
increase the efficiency an effectiveness of their execution. The Bank has been
participating in this pilot project since its launch. The Government's request that Bank
SWAps be disbursed directly to the federal treasury as reimbursement of government
expenditures was also a result of efforts to alleviate this budget constraint.

Annex page 103

Tlte Bank Itad a modest role tlrrouglt its work on the pilot program, and in the context of tlte
Bolsa Familia SWAp, as well as in policy dialogue discussion various options for reforming
budget rigidities, including tlte CFAA and ES W on improving Brazil 'sfiscal circumstances.
Increased quality and efficiency of spending. At the federal level, Government efforts
focused on fine-tuning the PPA management model (to be better integrated with sectoral
ministries) and reducing costs of government operations (through personnel and MIS
systems reforms). The Bank undertook AAA, Improving Fiscal Circumstances for
Growth (FY06), which assesses the overall level of public expenditures in Brazil and the
growth impact of expenditure composition. Other analytical activities have been
developed with the objective of building capacity and ownership of some line ministries
to conduct robust expenditure reviews as an instrument for guiding their policy
development and budget management (BRA VA in the Social Development Ministry and
the non lending TA Improving EfJiciency in the Road Transport Sector in the Finance and
Planning ministries). The pilot project revealed notable weaknesses in the capacity to
ensure individual investment were compatible with national macroeconomic objectives
and economically justified, as well as monitoring and coordination of project
implementation. To improve expenditure efficiency in infrastructure sectors, the
Government has created a task force across the Ministry of Finance the Ministry of
Planning and the Casa Civil, with the goal of building the institutional capacity necessary
for managing the public, supported by a Bank IDF grant. At the sub-national level, a
number of states have taken bold initiatives to reform public sector spending, notably
Minas Gerais and Ceara. Both were supported by Bank loans.

The Bank had a disappointingly limited impact in public expenditure efficiency. Sector work
was not effectively completed or disseminated, and tlte Bank took at very hands-off point of
view. Progress in the sector was not substantial, but was sufficient basis for a stronger
partnership than what emerged.
Increased efficiency and transparency in government procurement. The federal
government made tremendous gains in the efficiency, transparency and speed of its
procurement cycle during the CAS period through adoption of the "pregiio" reverse
auction process for goods and non-consultant services, often through web-based
application. Government contracts have seen savings of 20 percent and reductions from
70 days to 13 days to complete the procurement cycle. Several states have also initiated
procurement innovations as part of their overall public sector modernization efforts,
notably Minas Gerais (a "data-mining" system to improve government contracting) and
Ceara (a sourcing study which helped save over $30 million in government contracting).

Bank impact has been high and catalytic. Tlte Bank has been a valued partner both at the
federal level, tlrrouglt the dialogue related to preparation, discussion and implementation of
the CPAR (and a subsequent procirrement efficiency indicators exercise which was
subsequently adopted by the governmenf) and with Minas and Cearri through TA activities
associated with the lending program.
Challenges and gaps. The quality and efficiency of public spending continue to be
key priorities in the near term, while budget rigidity is a priority in the longer term. Scaling up
the procurement innovations (at federal level across ministries) and in the states is likely to have
substantial impact.

Annex page 104

3. Good governance
Achievements. There has been some notable progress in particular in the results
orientation of sub-national governments.
Increased capacity and result-orientation of sub-national governments. The 2000
Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) has institutionalized the incentives for fiscal discipline
of sub-national entities. The contribution of sub-nationals to the country's fiscal
adjustment effort was substantial over the period. Aggregated state and municipalities
fiscal primary surpluses grew from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to more than 1 percent in
2006. Individually, the number of states above the FRL limit of fell from 8 in 2002 to
only 2 in 2006. The fiscal situation of municipal governments also improved, the
majority adopting a tight fiscal stance and improved financial indicators. An exception is
a few of the largest cities which have suffered some deterioration.

The Bank's impact was high. Innovative lending programs in Minas (DPL) and Ceard
(S WAp) were vehicles to support aggressive and committed state reformers.
Increased public participation. Brazil has a high degree of community organization,
with an active participatory culture. The government has prioritized participation, with
several important formal mechanisms constructed to ensure this. Most important of these
was the Economic and Social Council (CDES). Including representatives from civil
society - business, academia, the arts and social movement leaders - CDES has been a
key formal advisory board to the president and government, but its impact has diminished
over time. Institutionalized as a channel for dialogue, CDES has undertaken systematic
dialogues with civil society throughout the country on a variety of development issues.
During the CAS period, it has advised the presidency on most aspects of program,
including the PAC and the PDE (national education plan). Of note, CDES went through
a National Development Agenda-setting exercise, where a vision statement for Brazil's
growth was defined, based on the "orienting values" of democracy, liberty, equity,
national identity, sustainability, respect for socio-cultural diversity, and sovereignty. The
bank assisted CDES with an IDF grant and during the CAS period was substantially
involved with civil society through a range of outreach activities.

The Bank had very limited impact through the ZDFgrant to CDES.
Improved property rights, law and contract enforcement. Two well-regarded ESW
reports fed into series of laws enacted in 2005-06 modifying the civil procedures code to
eliminate some common causes of contracting delay. The Growth TAL is also financing
studies on judicial delays. This effort also bolstered efforts of the national control
secretariat (STF) to improve judicial management statistics, which will help to create a
performance culture. While these are important achievements, dialogue is politically
delicate.

Annex page 105

TIte Bank support was small, but the impact was high, tltrough tlte AAA and TA.
Challenges and gaps. There is a wide variability in the capacities among states and
among municipalities, which is likely to represent a challenge in particular in the North and
Northeast. The governance agenda as defined is also likely to be broader than the three areas
defined above.
