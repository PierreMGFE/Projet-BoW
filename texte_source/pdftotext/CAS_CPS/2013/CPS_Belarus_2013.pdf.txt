FY14-FY17 COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
This is a joint World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Belarus. This joint CPS is based on: 1) an analysis of
Belarus’s key development challenges informed by our recent economic and sector work, 2)
alignment with the country’s development priorities and commitments, 3) examination of the
World Bank Group’s track record and lessons learned in implementing support programs in the
country, and 4) extensive consultation with and feedbacks from key stakeholders including
government agencies, local authorities, civil society organizations, development partners and
representatives of beneficiaries of our past and on-going support programs.
2.
Up until 2008 Belarus was a strong economic performer, with an average economic
growth rate of 8.1 percent during 2001–2008. Growth was propelled by a combination of
favorable external factors, including strong export demand by key trading partners, especially
Russia, underpriced energy imports from Russia and favorable terms of trade for key export
goods. Combined with public sector wage increases, this high growth rate resulted in a reduction
of absolute poverty from 30 percent in 2002 to 5 percent in 2009 and 2010. Poverty slightly
increased to 7 percent in 2011, as a result of declining real incomes in the context of high
inflation in 2011, but declined to 4.6 percent in 2012. Some progress has also been made in
reducing the role of the state in the economy. For example, the general governmental
expenditures were reduced from 46 percent of GDP in 2004 to 40 percent of GDP in 2012, while
the share of the private sector in GDP increased from 25 percent in 2004 to 30 percent in 2010 1.
However, overall structural reforms remain slow and piecemeal and Belarus continues to rely on
a largely unreformed economic model based on the dominance of the state-owned sector and
implied “social contract” of broad-based income distribution and high level of equity.
3.
The strong economic and social progress came to a halt in 2009, with the current
account deficit widening to over 12 percent of GDP, as the global financial crisis led to
reduced access to external borrowing and a sharp decline in exports, and price of gas
imports from Russia increased. In response, the government tightened macroeconomic policy
and devalued the Belarusian Rubel (BYR) by 30 percent, supported by financial assistance from
Russia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Initial stabilization gains were reversed,
however, after completion of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement (IMF SBA) in March 2010.
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, including rapid credit and wage growth, led to a
widening in the current account deficit and intensified pressure on international reserves. After a
significant loss of reserves at the beginning of 2011, confidence in the BYR collapsed, sparking
a foreign exchange crisis. By December 2011, the BYR had lost about 70 percent of its value to
the US Dollar and inflation soared to 109 percent. However, by early 2013, the authorities
managed to restore macroeconomic stability by tightening monetary and fiscal policies, while a
new favorable energy trade agreement with Russia helped to improve trade balance and,
consequently, ease pressure on the current account.
4.
Significant risks remain, especially given the large external debt financing needs.
Risks stemming from any loosening of fiscal and monetary policy are exacerbated by the
significant external refinancing needs Belarus will face in the next four years. This reinforces

1

iv

the continued need for tight macroeconomic policies and containment of the current account
deficit, especially given persistently low foreign exchange reserves.
5.
In addition to exposing existing macroeconomic vulnerabilities, the economic crises
reinforced the need for structural reforms to regain competitiveness and diversify and
modernize Belarus’s economy. In recent years, Belarus’s growth model has relied primarily on
a combination of external borrowing and cheap energy inputs, while productivity growth has
slowed down and has been outpaced by real wage growth. Moreover, Russia’s accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will increase competition for Belarusian products on the
Russian market. For Belarus to achieve further growth and social development, it needs to create
an environment that allows its enterprises to dynamically adapt to the demands of an increasingly
competitive global economy. Achieving this while preserving social outcomes will require
tackling several complex challenges.
6.
Comprehensive structural reforms will be critical to regaining competitiveness,
maintaining macroeconomic stability and sustaining growth. In the future, Belarus’s growth
will have to rely on significant productivity gains driven by structural reforms. Such reforms are
needed to invigorate key engines of growth, primarily the private sector, attract Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) and technology, and reduce the footprint of the state-run segments of the
economy. Labor and capital need to be reallocated to high-productivity segments, the stateowned enterprise (SOE) sector needs to be restructured, and reforms implemented to support the
private sector. Further integration into the global economy and diversification of exports,
especially of non-energy exports, would also contribute to improved economic resilience.
Belarus’s intention to join the WTO offers an important opportunity in this respect and will also
reinforce the impetus for liberalization across several sectors in the economy, including services.
Finally, building on the fiscal consolidation effort of the past years, further efforts are needed to
reduce inefficient subsidies, whilst addressing spending pressure from an aging population, and
to enhance efficiency of spending.
7.
Growth sustainability is also constrained by deteriorating infrastructure, inefficient
use of energy, and significant unrealized economic potential of the country’s natural
resources, particularly forestry. Despite remarkable progress in reducing energy intensity,
which fell from 0.69 tons of oil equivalent per thousand of 2005 dollar of GDP (PPP) in 1990 to
about 0.23 in 2010, Belarus is still lagging behind Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) countries. There is a need for more sustainable use of domestically
available fuels, including renewables, and greater diversification, as currently about 95 percent
of Belarus’s power is produced from gas imported from Russia. This is especially important as
the effective subsidy on imported gas has been declining. Finally, there is a need for more
effective use of agricultural, forest and other environmental resources – forests and arable land
together constitute only 9 percent of value added in the economy, despite accounting for 70
percent of the country’s land area.
8.
Social service delivery systems, while providing widely accessible and affordable
social protection, health and education services, are costly and inefficient. Belarus has a
very low share of targeted, means-tested programs, and it does not provide adequate
unemployment insurance. It is therefore ill-prepared to mitigate the social impact of structural
reforms. Life expectancy remains nine years below the Western European average, largely due
to high adult mortality, especially among men (whose life expectancy is 12 years less than in
Belarus’s European neighbors). The education system has performed well in terms of access and
enrollment, but much needs to be done to improve spending efficiency in the sector. Education
and labor skills mismatch is increasingly becoming an issue.
v

9.
Responding to the above development challenges, the World Bank Group (WBG)
strategy will support three areas of reforms to improve: (1) competitiveness of the economy
by supporting structural reforms, including reducing the role of the state, transforming the SOE
sector, promoting private and financial sector development and integration into the global
economy; (2) quality and efficiency of public infrastructure services, use of agricultural and
forestry resources and global benefits of public goods; and (3) human development outcomes
through better education, health and social services.
10.
The WBG’s program in Belarus will be calibrated according to the depth, breath
and speed of structural reforms. The program will include Analytical and Advisory Activities
(AAA), investment lending by the World Bank and investments in the private sector by the IFC.
Accordingly, the AAA and lending programs have been identified only for the first two years of
the CPS. Should structural reforms accelerate, lending scope and instruments could be revisited
at mid-term of the CPS period.
11.
The WBG’s AAA program will be critical in creating consensus in important policy
areas and building capacity in the country. It will focus on advice in key policy areas such as
structural reforms, trade, fiscal, PFM, private and financial sector development, education and
municipal services. The World Bank’s investment lending will focus on sectors with an
adequate and improving policy framework, a sufficient knowledge base, a solid implementation
track record and demonstrated Government commitment, direct benefits to ordinary citizens
and/or global public goods benefits.
12.
The IFC will support private sector development and energy efficiency
improvements through a combination of investments and advisory work. The IFC program
in Belarus will support: (i) trade development in critical sectors such as agriculture, with
strategic focus on small and medium-sized exporters and importers, (ii) micro, small, and
medium-sized enterprises’ (MSMEs) access to finance, (iii) investments into energy efficiency
improvements, and (iv) advisory work on regulatory simplification, including in agriculture and
forestry. Agriculture and forestry will remain priority sectors, with support directed at
improvements in agricultural output and efficiency, access to finance, regulatory environment,
and food safety.
13.
The WBG will continue using donor Trust Fund (TF) resources strategically to
support the core objectives of the CPS. The WBG will use its AAA to engage other
development partners in supporting the country’s reform program and seek partnerships with
donors to leverage funds for programmatic technical assistance and advisory services.
14.
All areas of engagement will benefit from an increased focus on governance and
social accountability. Engagement on governance issues through policy dialogue will continue
on the most crucial reform issues, including public finance and fiscal governance reforms and
dialogue on transition to a new growth model. The demand-side governance engagement will
focus on participatory monitoring of service delivery outcomes, encouraging accountability to
the beneficiaries through transparency and empowerment.
15.
The WBG will apply a gender lens in its AAA and lending operations aiming to
identify gender disparities and suggest possible ways of addressing them through WBG
supported activities. Building on the current WBG program, possible focus areas could include
equal participation of women in the labor force and entrepreneurship, reduced male mortality
rates linked to non-communicable diseases and hazardous lifestyles, sustainability of the pension
and healthcare systems, and higher impact of social services.
16.
Risks to the CPS remain high due to a historically mixed track record of reform
implementation in the past. The proposed calibrated engagement will mitigate this risk by
vi

designing and adjusting the WBG’s assistance according to the strength of the government’s
commitment and reform progress. Also, the WBG will continue to engage in dialogue with the
Government in important policy reform areas.
17.
One major risk is the reemergence of price and exchange rate instability. Belarus
has only recently emerged from the severe crisis of 2011, when unsustainable policies pushed the
economy into an inflation-depreciation spiral. Since mid-2011 stabilization measures have been
in place, restoring foreign exchange markets and reducing inflation and the current account
deficit. However, premature policy loosening in 2012 has led to the reemergence of price and
exchange rate pressures, posing renewed risk to an already-weak reserve position. Accordingly,
the WBG will carefully monitor emerging economic and fiscal developments. While the IMF
will take the lead on macroeconomic issues, the WBG’s dialogue on public expenditures and
budget management would be intensified and re-oriented, should economic instability reemerge.
18.
The CPS has been developed through extensive consultations with key stakeholders
including the authorities, business associations, civil society, development partners, and
beneficiaries of WBG-supported programs. A wide range of perspectives on Belarus’s
development priorities, challenges, and opportunities in such areas as economic competitiveness,
human development, infrastructure services, global public goods, governance and gender were
received and taken on board. As proposed by civil society partners, instruments will be
developed to engage beneficiaries and civil society in monitoring the provision of services in
projects supported by the WBG, thus contributing to improving results and enhancing dialogue
with the authorities and service providers on the needs of beneficiaries.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA
Social and Political Context
19.
Belarus is an upper middle income country with a population of 9.5 million, similar
in size to many Central and Eastern European countries, with a fast declining and aging
population. In the past ten years the population fell by over 400,000 and the number of citizens
above the age of 60 is projected to increase by 14 percent in the next decade alone. 2 Although
Belarus has already achieved almost all of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
continued efforts are needed to enhance progress in combating HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis,
ensure environmental sustainability, develop a global partnership for development, and boost
shared prosperity. 3
20.
While the role of the state has been gradually reduced, Belarus continues to
preserve a largely unreformed economic model based on the dominance of public sector
and a “social contract” of broad-based income redistribution and a high level of social
equity. The country has highly centralized decision-making and relatively strong administrative
capacity. Public trust in public institutions such as the government, the parliament, and the
presidency is higher than in most countries of the region 4 . Although global and regional
pressures and country-specific economic challenges have led to some liberalization of the
business climate and optimization of social programs, the potential short-term social costs of
reforms have limited the speed of reform.
21.
Relations with the European Union (EU) and the United States remain strained on
account of these actors’ concerns regarding political rights, following the controversial
2010 Presidential election. Belarus is a member of the multilateral track of the six-country
Eastern Partnership Community that aims to foster cooperation with the EU, and among the
partner states themselves. In 2012, the EU designed and launched the European Dialogue for
Belarus Modernization, a multi-stakeholder exchange of views and ideas between the EU and a
variety of stakeholders in Belarus.
22.
Belarus enjoys economic and geo-political support from its Eastern neighbors. The
Common Economic Space of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, which allows free movement of
capital, goods, services and labor, was launched in January 2012. An agreement on establishing
a Eurasian Economic Union could be signed as early as in 2015. Belarus also receives
significant Anti-Crisis Fund support (USD 3 billion over 2011-2013) from the Eurasian
Development Bank (EDB).

Recent Economic Developments
23.
Up until 2008, Belarus was a strong economic performer in a fast-growing region.
During 2000–08, the country’s GDP grew on average by 8.1 percent annually, more rapidly than
the averages for both the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region (5.7 percent) and the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) (7.1 percent). During that period, per capita income
more than doubled in real terms, reaching USD 5,820 in 20115. Rapid economic growth was
propelled by a combination of favorable external factors. These included strong export demand
by key trading partners (CIS, especially Russia), underpriced energy imports from Russia and
large terms of trade gains stemming from exporting goods such as oil products and fertilizers,
which saw steep price increases, especially in the years prior to the global economic crisis. But
the strong growth record was associated with growing macroeconomic vulnerabilities. External

24.
Growth slowed substantially during the global economic crisis of 2008-09, and since
then the country has gone through a period of recurring macroeconomic instability. The
2008 global economic crisis was transmitted to Belarus primarily through lower export demand
and reduced access to external borrowing. Growth dropped to 0.2 percent in 2009. The
government’s initial macroeconomic policy response in 2009 involved an external adjustment
through tight macroeconomic policy and a one-off adjustment of the exchange rate, supported by
external financing, including from the IMF. However, initial stabilization gains, achieved in
2009, were reversed by expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, including fast credit
expansion under government-directed lending programs, which fuelled a rapid, but short-lived
economic recovery in 2010. This recovery came at the expense of further deterioration of the
current account deficit to 15 percent of GDP in 2010, heightened pressure on the exchange rate
and foreign exchange reserves, which eventually led to loss of control of the exchange rate and
sharply accelerating inflation during 2011. After a period of multiple exchanges rates, the BYR
lost close to 70 percent of its value vis-à-vis the USD and inflation soared to 108.7 percent in
December 2011.
25.
As of early 2013, macroeconomic stability remains fragile. Tight monetary and fiscal
policy, especially during the first half of the year helped to contain Consumer Price Index (CPI)
inflation, which was subdued to 21.8 percent (eop) in 2012, compared to 108.7 percent (eop) in
2011. The foreign exchange market has stabilized after a sharp devaluation in 2011. The
devaluation, together with significant terms of trade gains related to a new favorable energy trade
agreement with Russia, helped to improve the trade balance from a deficit of 2.0 percent of GDP
in 2011 to a surplus of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2012. This in turn eased pressure on the current
account deficit, which narrowed further from 8.5 percent of GDP at the end of 2011 to 2.8
percent of GDP in 2012. Foreign exchange reserves (excluding monetary gold) have recovered
from the 2011 slump, but remain precariously low at USD 5.8 billion, equivalent to 1.5 months
of imports at the end of 2012.

26.
However, significant risks remain, especially given large external debt refinancing
needs over the coming four years. Imbalances could reemerge if there is renewed fiscal and
monetary expansion. With consumer price inflation in Belarus remaining above the level of
most trading partners, real exchange appreciation is already eroding the competitiveness gained
from the devaluation. In addition, the country faces significant external refinancing needs.
Belarus has largely relied on external debt to finance its current account deficit with limited FDI.
Gross external debt to GDP ratio increased 2.5 times over 2009–11, exceeding 62 percent of
GDP, while public debt more than doubled in relation to GDP within the same period to 30.7
percent at the end of 2012. The maturity structure of private corporate and banking sector
external debt is heavily weighted on the short term (around 45 percent). Belarus will also need
to refinance a significant part of its public external debt in the coming three years, including
repayments of IMF loans and Eurobonds. This will add significantly to the country’s gross
financing needs and put additional strain on the balance of payments, reinforcing the continued
need for tight macroeconomic policies and containment of current account deficit, especially in
the context of persistently low foreign exchange reserves.
27.
Moreover, the macroeconomic crises of the past few years have revealed deep
structural constraints in Belarus’s state-dominated economic growth model. Past growth
was significantly assisted by a combination of favorable external factors, including cheap energy
imports from Russia, strong export demand by key trading partners, especially Russia, and
favorable terms of trade for key export goods. These (temporarily) positive factors have partly
offset the negative impact of state interference in resource allocation and economic management,
which has resulted in stagnating productivity and eroding competitiveness. 6 State interference
has left a large proportion of productive resources locked in an inefficient SOE sector, and has

restricted private sector development, particularly of the Small and Medium-Size Enterprises
(SMEs) and service sector, which are crucial for employment growth. Expansion of the private
sector has also been hindered by a small and undiversified financial sector dominated by stateowned banks and state lending programs. GDP growth has thus become increasingly dependent
on domestic demand driven by expansionary monetary/fiscal policies, but at the expense of
macroeconomic stability.

Poverty Trends, Shared Prosperity and Gender

Rapid economic growth has translated into remarkable poverty reduction over the
past decade, despite a modest increase in poverty in the aftermath of the recent crisis. The
absolute poverty rate (national poverty line 7 ) declined from 30 percent in 2002 to about 11
percent in 2006, and more than halved in recent years, falling from 11 percent in 2006 to 5
percent in 2010. The rapid decline in poverty was driven by fast GDP growth and increases in
wages and real income. The poverty rate increased slightly to 7 percent in 2011, largely as a
result of price increases and declining real wages in the context of high inflation in 2011, and
declined to 4.6percent in 2012. This positive trend in poverty reduction is matched by Belarus’s
high level of shared prosperity. Growth in consumption for the poorest 40 percent of the
population was not only higher than in other countries of the region, but also above national
average growth in consumption, suggesting a positive trend in income equality between 2002
and 2008.

However, absolute poverty in rural areas is twice as high as in urban areas, and
large heterogeneity in poverty incidence is found among regions. Although poverty declined
in both rural and urban areas between 2006 and 2010, the rural poverty rate remained about
twice as high as the urban rate throughout the period. Similarly, both areas experienced an
increase in absolute poverty in 2011, resulting in poverty rate of 11.5 percent in rural and 5.8
percent in urban areas. Further heterogeneity is found among regions. In Brest, Vitebsk, Gomel
and Mogilev, absolute poverty ranges between 9 and 10 percent, although the 2011 increase in
poverty affected in particular Brest and Vitebsk. Minsk and Grodno oblasts appeared less
7

In 2013, the national poverty line in Belarus is set at around USD 107 per month.

4

vulnerable to the 2011 crisis: poverty levels remained almost stable at 2010 levels of around 6.2
percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, despite the increasing trend in Minsk oblast in previous
years.
30.
Moreover, households with children remain highly vulnerable to absolutely poverty,
and poverty increased more among working-age men than women. In 2011, the proportion
of children aged 17 and below living in families with incomes below the poverty line was 12.3
percent (11.9 percent in 2010). Additionally, the deterioration in the poverty rate in 2011
particularly affected men of working age: 6.2 percent of men over 18 (versus 5.3 percent of
women) in Belarus are estimated to live in absolute poverty. The gender gap in the poverty rate
between men and women has been widening, possibly due to a higher level of economic activity
among men, which results in higher vulnerability to changes in the economic environment.
However, the gender gap is reversed in terms of relative poverty, due to women’s greater
dependence on pensions and employment in lower-paid jobs.
31.
While Belarus follows principles of equality and non-discrimination in its policies
and has a basic legal framework in place, gender equality appears to be given lower
priority compared to other social issues, and gender gaps persist in the areas of human
capital and economic opportunities. Gender inequality affects primarily women on issues of
employment and economic opportunities, although less than in most countries in the region. In
particular, women participate less than men in the labor market (in first quarter 2012, 62 percent,
compared to men’s 69 percent and ECA average of about 51 percent). Despite a higher
educational level, women tend to earn on average about 26.3 percent less than men (2011), and
the wage gap has been increasing over the past decade. Women appear to be disproportionately
represented in the public sector, and are less likely to be represented at the top levels in politics
and public administration, or own business and manage firms. On the positive side, according to
the most recent Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS, 2008),
participation of women in management is higher in Belarus than in ECA on average; women are,
however, more likely to manage and own small enterprises rather than manage large firms.
Despite the Government’s efforts, human trafficking and domestic violence still represent
significant risks for women.
32.
Men are at a disadvantage compared to women in terms of life expectancy and
enrollment in tertiary education. The gender gap in life expectancy at birth is a particular
cause for concern (65 years for men and 77 years for women in 2011). This gap has been stable
throughout the past decade and remains among the highest in ECA. More details about gender
issues in Belarus are provided in Annex 5.

Economic Prospects and Risks
33.
Belarus enters this CPS period with fragile macroeconomic stability and in an
external environment characterized by great uncertainty. Over the short to medium term,
Belarus’s economic prospects depend on consistent and stability-oriented macroeconomic
policies to lower inflation, to rein in external imbalances, and to strengthen reserves, particularly
given the looming external debt refinancing risks. Consequently, structural reforms to address
the lack of competitiveness and other structural constraints will need to be accelerated.
34.
Looking ahead, growth rates over the near to medium term are expected to remain
far below the levels experienced prior to 2008, given external and domestic constraints.
Growth is expected to accelerate to 2.5 percent during 2013, driven by an expansion of domestic
demand. The current account deficit is expected to widen to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2013, as
external demand will remain subdued, putting renewed pressure on foreign reserves, especially
in the context of large external refinancing needs over the coming 4 years, due to repayments of
IMF loans and maturing external bonds. On the fiscal side, while a balanced budget is expected,
5

slowing inflation together with rising expenditures is likely to lead to a return of small deficits
during 2014 and 2015.

35.
Domestically, more expansionary monetary and fiscal policies could boost growth,
but would undermine macroeconomic stability. While the authorities have stated continued
stabilization as a primary objective for 2013 and going forward, official growth targets still aim
for 8.5 percent GDP growth in 2013, which would be incompatible with this objective. Attempts
to achieve a growth target through more aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion could succeed
in the short run, but would risk renewed destabilization, inducing a sharper – and hence more
damaging – adjustment later on.
36.
These risks could be amplified by further deterioration in the external environment
if demand for Belarusian exports were to worsen. The high concentration of exports to the
Russian market exposes Belarus to terms of trade and export demand risks. A substantial
deterioration of the external environment associated with a worsening of the Eurozone crisis
could pass through to Belarus through declining commodity prices and its impact on external
demand, especially in Russia. A significantly lower growth path of the Russian economy would
lead to a worsening of Belarus’s already precarious external position. The situation could be
further exacerbated, if Russia would again start to raise energy prices, reversing recent terms of
trade gains, with detrimental impacts on Belarus trade and external position.

Development Challenges and Opportunities
37.
Belarus has emerged from the macroeconomic crises of 2009 and 2011, but faces both
formidable challenges and unique opportunities to build the foundation for sustained and
shared prosperity. The macroeconomic crises of the past years have reinforced the need for
structural reforms to regain competitiveness, to diversify and modernize the country’s economic
structure, and to create sustainable and productive jobs. For Belarus to achieve further growth and
social development, it needs to create an environment that allows its enterprises to dynamically

6

adapt to the demands of an increasingly competitive global economy. Achieving this, while
preserving social outcomes, will require tackling several complex and interrelated challenges. 8

A.

Creating a Competitive and Sustainable Growth Model

38.
Comprehensive structural reforms will be critical to maintain macroeconomic
stability, improve competitiveness, sustain growth and job creation and boost shared
prosperity for all citizens of Belarus. Compared to most other transition economies, Belarus
has pursued a very gradualist transition path. Despite some initial structural reforms, the
economy continues to be characterized by a large state presence. Belarus has preserved large
state-owned and state-controlled enterprises. The state-owned sector, which is supported by an
extensive system of state support, still accounts for over half of output and two thirds of
employment. While this approach has helped Belarus avoid the social cost associated with
economic restructuring, it has resulted in serious vulnerabilities, including stagnant productivity
growth, loss of competitiveness and reliance on underpriced energy imports from Russia.

39.
Belarus’s economy remains dependent on energy and resource intensive exports and
underpriced energy imports from Russia: Belarus’s trade is concentrated in energy- and
resource-intensive product categories. Imports of mineral products, including crude oil and
natural gas account for 42 percent of the country’s total imports, while mineral exports, mainly
of refined oil products account for about 36 percent of total exports (2011). Belarus continues to
import natural gas and crude oil from Russia at below world market prices. The average annual
Russian oil and gas subsidy for the period 2001–08 is estimated at 14.5 percent of Belarus’s
GDP, but declined sharply during 2009–10, as a result of rising import prices and falling world
commodity prices. While these underpriced energy imports have spurred economic growth, they
expose the country to increased commodity price volatility and risks associated with the
negotiation of energy trade agreements with Russia. The increase in the import price of natural
gas from USD47 per thousand cubic meters (TCM) in 2005 to USD263.5 per TCM in 2011 was
associated with a sharp deterioration of Belarus’s energy trade balance, which in turn put
pressure on the current account. The most recent energy trade agreement concluded in late 2011
and covering the period until 2014 reduced the gas import price for 2012 to USD165.6 per TCM,
contributing positively to the external adjustment.

unproductive use of factors of production. Rapid growth in real wages has outpaced labor
productivity, creating cost pressures and undermining competitiveness. These internal cost
pressures are compounded by Russia’s WTO accession, which will intensify competition, not
only in Belarus’s main export market for manufactured goods, but also domestically through
commitments under the Customs Union.
41.
Despite improvements in the business climate, the private sector remains small
relative to regional peers. Given the dominance of SOEs, the private sector and especially
SMEs remain marginalized. Over the past several years, Belarus has made a deliberate effort to
improve its business climate. The most recent World Bank/IFC Doing Business Indicators for
2013 show marked achievements in the areas of business start-up and property registration, but
persistent weaknesses remain in the area of regulatory environment for business operation as
well as protection of property rights. With eased regulatory requirements for entry, the number
of new private firms increased by some 30 percent in 2007 and 2008, albeit from a very small
base. The rate of private firm growth decelerated considerably in 2009 and did not recover in
2010 in the context of persistent macroeconomic uncertainty. More importantly, these
improvements related to business entry have not translated into significant private sector job
creation.
42.
Relatively undiversified and costly financial intermediation is also a significant
constraint to private sector investment and growth. Commercial banks control 98 percent of
total assets in the financial sector. Corporate bond and equity markets, which have become a
8

major source of investment financing in many other middle-income economies, as well as nonbank financial institutions, are at a nascent stage of development. Moreover, the banking sector
is dominated by state-owned banks. While there are 31 licensed commercial banks, the two
largest state-owned banks—Belarusbank and Belagroprombank—have a combined market share
of about 70 percent of total assets. In addition, the Government exerts direct influence on credit
allocation through government-directed programs, which channel funds toward the government’s
priority sectors, projects, and individual companies at subsidized interest rates, often with
explicit government guarantees. The crowding out by government lending programs drives up
the cost of funding for private firms, particularly in the aftermath of the latest crisis. Recurrent
macroeconomic instability also impedes financial inclusion, with only 19 percent of population
currently using formal intermediaries for savings purposes.

While Belarus has achieved a significant contraction in the size of the government
budget, the overall tax burden remains high. Since 2008 – induced in part by the
macroeconomic crises, Belarus has achieved a significant contraction in the size of
Government. 9 The public expenditure to GDP ratio contracted by almost 14 percentage points
over the past four years, to reach 36 percent of GDP at the end of 2011. The composition of the
adjustment largely reflects a contraction in discretionary spending. Capital expenditures took the
brunt of the adjustment, while government consumption contracted at a much slower pace.
Despite this contraction, Belarus continues to have a high overall tax burden in regional
comparison. Reflecting the social orientation of economic policies, public expenditures are
dominated by social transfers, including pensions and social protection spending. At the same
time, the country also continues to have above average outlays for subsidies (about 5 percent of
GDP in 2011), including in the agricultural sector.
44.
Securing macroeconomic stability is key to sustainable prosperity. To curb
overheating and avoid reigniting inflationary and exchange rate pressures, sound macroeconomic
policy is critical. The flexible exchange rate policy needs to be maintained; credit growth,
especially lending under government programs (LGP) needs to be further curtailed; fiscal
accounts need to remain balanced, as planned by the authorities; and income policies, especially
real wage growth, need to be moderated in line with productivity growth.
45.
Coupled with stability-oriented macroeconomic management, deepened and
accelerated structural reforms are required to regain competiveness and combat economic
imbalances. This implies that growth will have to rely on significant productivity gains driven
by structural reforms. Such reforms are needed to invigorate additional engines of growth (such
as the private sector, including services), attract quality FDI and technology, and reduce footprint
of the state-run segments of the economy. Increasing Belarus’s competitiveness requires the
reallocation of labor and capital to high productivity segments, restructuring of the SOE sector,
and implementation of reforms to support the private sector. In addition to accelerating
privatization to bring strategic investment, both financially and in terms of production
technologies, this will entail changes in the incentive structure of SOEs to ensure efficient
employment of both capital and labor. In parallel, moving towards a more diversified financial
sector operating at market terms is essential for more efficient allocation of resources to the
productive parts of the economy. These reforms are especially urgent given the loss of
competitiveness and a governance structure based on rigidly planned targets which do not reflect
true economic scarcities, and low capacity to adapt to changes in demand and supply. Further
integration into the global economy and diversification of exports would also contribute to
improved economic resilience. Belarus’s intention to join the WTO offers an important
opportunity in this respect and will also reinforce the impetus for liberalization across several
sectors in the economy, including services. Finally, building on the fiscal consolidation effort of
the past years, further efforts are needed to reduce inefficient subsidies whilst addressing agingrelated spending pressure and enhancing the efficiency of spending in the social sectors,
including health and education.

9

The Belarus Programmatic Public Expenditure Review Volume 1 and 2 (2011 and 2012) provides an in-depth
analysis of macro-fiscal policies and public spending in key sectors, including energy services, agriculture, social
assistance, pensions, intergovernmental fiscal relations, education and health.

B.
Achieving Sustainable Provision of Infrastructure and Efficient Use of
Natural Resources
46.
Long-term sustained growth in Belarus is constrained by deteriorating infrastructure,
inefficient use of energy, and failure to realize the economic potential of the country’s natural
resources.

to spend adequately on road
maintenance, repair and upgrading. However, in recent years expenditures on road maintenance
(current and periodic) have decreased substantially, falling to unsustainable levels which are now
resulting in worsening road conditions and further undermining Belarus’s competitiveness.
48.
In the water and wastewater sector, infrastructure development needs also remain
very significant: 26 percent of the population is yet to be connected to sewerage services and 14
percent to water services. Wastewater treatment, affected by obsolete equipment and technology,
often fails to meet acceptable standards in terms of nutrients removal– water with excessive iron
content is still supplied to more than 20 percent of Belarus population. Low operational
efficiency coupled with user charges well below cost-recovery level puts a strain on public utility
and communal budgets, which force local authorities to postpone important capital replacement
and rehabilitation investments. As a result, technical and economic efficiency has significantly
deteriorated, with water losses in urban areas increasing from 15 percent to 25 percent in the last
four years. Local authorities’ discretion in setting tariff levels is limited and deficits are generally
covered by subsidies and transfers. It is estimated that these tariffs cover about half of the cost of
waste collection and disposal and 85 percent of the cost of water and wastewater services, with
the difference covered through cross subsidies from non-households and other transfers from
Oblast budgets. In addition, there is an urgent need to improve the system’s energy efficiency.
Energy
49.
Energy is by far the most unsustainable element of the public sector in Belarus.
Despite remarkable progress in reducing energy intensity, which fell from 0.69 tons of oil
equivalent per thousand of 2005 dollar of GDP (PPP) in the 1990 to about 0.23 in 2010, Belarus
is still lagging somewhat behind OECD countries. To reduce dependence on energy imports,
there is a need for increased use of domestically available fuels, including renewables, and
greater diversification of Belarus’s energy sector – currently about 95 percent of Belarus power
is produced from gas imported from Russia. Reforms of the utility sector, including tariff
reforms are vital to achieving financial viability of the energy sector, especially as import prices
may increase again in the future.
50.
The sector is characterized by a high degree of state ownership, strong vertical
integration, administered tariffs, and cross-subsidization. Residential tariffs are very low and
11

do not reflect the cost of services. While low residential tariffs have kept household
expenditures on utility services in Belarus below 10 percent of household income much lower
than in most countries in the region—they have undermined the financial viability and
sustainability of the sector, especially with the uncertainties about level of subsidies on gas
imports from Russia. Significant financial losses incurred by utility companies are compensated
through a complex, non-transparent system of direct subsidies and cross-subsidies between nonresidential and residential consumers as well as between energy services. Taken together, the
sector drains fiscal resources to the tune of about 2 percent of GDP annually.
51.
In response to rising energy costs, the Government plans to move to cost-reflective
energy pricing by 2014 and generate fiscal savings in the range of 1–2.6 percent of GDP
annually. The required tariff increases to achieve these cost recovery targets are substantial.
Residential heat tariffs would have to be increased by 112–256 percent by 2014, depending on
import fuel prices. With no real increases in residential tariffs, the estimated size of budgetary
and cross-subsidies for 2011–14 would be in the range of 1.9–3.9 percent of GDP annually,
depending on natural gas prices.

Opportunities to reduce energy intensity and net carbon emissions could derive
from three sources:
• infrastructure improvements that can reduce the carbon footprint of public services,
including transport and water supply
• continued improvements in energy efficiency that can reduce consumption of carbon
fuels
• efficient exploitation of Belarus’s extensive forest resources, which cover about 39
percent of the land area, that can contribute to carbon absorption
Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability
53.
Natural resources also suffer from sub-optimal management. There is great potential
for more effective use of agricultural, forest and other environmental resources. This will require
significant policy reform, including restructuring of agricultural policies and subsidies, which are
currently accounting for over half of agricultural output.
12

Forestry
54.
Forests in Belarus cover nearly 39 percent of the territory, providing multiple
environmental services, raw material to forest industry, employment, biomass for generation of
heat and power and non-timber forest products for commercial production and subsistence
consumption by local communities. In 2011, the forestry sector contributed 1.2 percent of GDP
(0.7 percent forest industry) and exports amounted to USD 1.2 billion. There is considerable
domestic and international investment planned for the wood processing sector (USD 2.9 billion
over the next 5 years). Generally, Belarus forests are well stocked and growing (in both standing
volume and area), and illegal harvesting is practically non-existent. There is, however, room for
improving management in use of forestry resources, better forest policy, legal, administrative
and institutional reforms, including an up-to-date national forest policy and strategy, better forest
legislation and law enforcement, and more efficient technologies for forest harvesting.
Agriculture
55.
Agriculture is unreformed and underperforming, and is a burden on the state
budget. The sector contributes just about 8 percent to GDP, while absorbing as much as 5
percent of GDP in the form of state support in subsidies and tax concessions. Fiscal support to
the agricultural sector, including tax concessions and budgetary expenditures, is substantial,
accounting for 67 percent of agricultural GDP. This extensive support has resulted in a largely
unprofitable sector, with enterprises registering soaring levels of debts, often governmentguaranteed, resulting in further pressure for state support.
56.
Agricultural subsidies absorb the largest share of spending, while expenditures on
non-distorting public goods are limited. Subsidies have increased as a result of growing input
prices and growing expenditures on interest subsides and called guarantees for directed lending
activities in the sector. Capital expenditures are down from a peak of almost 11 percent of total
agricultural spending to 5 percent in 2009-10. Using the WTO classification of agricultural
support, amber box measures (market- and trade-distorting state support) account for the largest
chunk of spending, while the share of market-neutral green box measures remains low.
57.
Agricultural policy aims to support producers and protect consumers by keeping
food prices low, but current policies distort incentives and undermine financial viability of
the sector. Farm production costs have risen quickly as a result of increased prices for fertilizers
and other farm inputs, while price controls and artificially low farm gate prices have depressed
farm revenues. Productivity of labor and capital in agriculture is much lower than in other
sectors of the economy and about 6.9 percent of Belarus’s farms are unprofitable enterprises.
Continuous state support and soft loans have avoided the needed restructuring of non-viable
enterprises and contributed to poor and declining farm performance.

C.

ImprovingHuman Development Outcomes

58.
Reflecting Belarus’s socially oriented economic policies, social sector spending,
including social protection, education and health, accounts for about half of government
expenditures. However, while the current social protection system provides a wide range of
benefits, Belarus has a very low share of targeted, means-tested programs. More importantly, the
system does not currently provide for adequate unemployment insurance and is therefore illprepared to mitigate social impact of structural reforms and to cope with demands of a more
dynamic labor market. Moreover, the public service delivery system, while providing widely
accessible and affordable health and education services, is constrained by the lack of incentives
to improve efficiency and quality due to input and historical-expenditure-based financing
mechanisms.

13

59.
The social sectors suffer from high levels of expenditure but relatively poor
outcomes. Life expectancy – while slowly recovering – remains 9 years below West European
average, largely due to high adult mortality, especially among men (whose life expectancy is 12
years less than their European neighbors). Belarus is characterized by extremely high mortality
rates among adults, vast majority of which is due to non-communicable diseases (in particular
cardio-vascular diseases, which are now the main cause of mortality and the key reason for low
life expectancy) and injuries.
Education
60.
Belarus’s education system has performed well in improving access and
enrollments. Gross enrollment ratio in primary education remains high at 100 percent since
2000 while gross enrollment ratio in general secondary education was at105 percent by 2011.
Demand for tertiary education has increased over the last decade leading to a 1.7 times increase
in the number of students per 10,000 population between 2000 and 2011.Belarus ranks high in
terms of the Human Development Index (HDI) (50th out of 187 countries in 2012), largely thanks
to the achievements in education. Household spending on education is moderate by regional
standards, suggesting broad affordability of education.

skilled staff in the teaching force. Belarus could save about 11 percent of the education budget
(0.6 percent of GDP) if its student-teacher ratio were to rise to the OECD average – it is
currently the second lowest in the CIS. While per-student cost has been increasing, this has not
necessarily led to better learning outcomes. Yet, the current system of education financing
provides little incentive to sub-national governments to allocate resources in an efficient manner.
Instead, existing financing arrangements which focus on inputs encourage schools and local
governments to retain large numbers of staff and maintain excess facilities.
62.
Education is becoming outdated– larger number of businesses in Belarus than in most
ECA countries report shortages of skilled labor as the main constraint to business (although such
reported shortages are also linked to broader issues in terms of labor market functioning).
Health
63.
The health system has delivered effectively on a range of indicators, including infant
and maternal health and containment of communicable diseases, including HIV and TB.
However, life expectancy – while starting to recover over last two years– remains below pre14

transition levels largely due to high adult mortality, especially among men. Belarus lags behind
on prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), in particular of cardio-vascular diseases,
which are now the main cause of mortality and key reason for low life expectancy.

hospitals, hospital beds, doctors,

standards. Significant savings could be made if Belarus reduced its number of hospital beds and
strengthened its preventive and primary care services.

65.
Moreover, there are large discrepancies in internal efficiency of hospitals, with
significant variation in average length of stay and unit costs for similar treatments across the
country. These problems are a result of the current, largely input-based financing arrangement
that encourages health care providers to use more staff, beds and other inputs to justify their
budgets and does not provide any incentive to improve productivity, quality of care or health
outcomes.

Government Priorities and Medium-Term Strategy
67.
The Government identifies the country’s development challenges and constraints to
sustainable economic growth as: (i) inadequate economic efficiency caused by the dominance
of high import, resource and energy intensive industries and low labor productivity leading to
low competitiveness of domestic production; (ii) reduced investment efficiency and slow growth
of FDI; (iii) lagging innovations; (iv) small GDP share of SMEs (21 percent) which is much
lower than in European countries; (v) high dependence on energy imports and high energy GDP
intensity; (vi) low incentives for productive labor and low efficiency of agriculture; (vii) low
financial efficiency and missing resources for modernization in the real sector; and (viii) lack of
adequate institutional infrastructure to facilitate public/private interface (property rights, efficient
rules, financial intermediation).
68.
The Program of Social and Economic Development for 2011-2015, together with
Plan of Government’s Activities for 2011-2015, sets an objective to increase prosperity and
improve living conditions of the population on the basis of modernization of economic
relations, innovative development and increased competitiveness of the economy. It sets bold
targets for 2015 vis-à-vis 2010 and calls for ambitious reforms in the following priority areas: (i)
human development, including quality of health and education (increase life expectancy to 72-73
years and ensure Belarus is in top-50 countries in Human Development Index); (ii) economic
modernization and high-tech development (the share of exports of high-tech goods should
account for 12-14 percent in total exports of goods and services); (iii) entrepreneurship and
business initiative and FDI (the share of SMEs should go up to 30 percent of GDP);(iv) exports
of goods and services, and foreign trade (exports of goods and services should grow by 2.2 times
and current account surplus should amount to at least 0.5-0.6 percent of GDP); (v) sustainable
regional development; (vi) accessible housing; and (vii) efficient agriculture and
16

forestry(agricultural output should grow by 1.39-1.45 times and share of mature forests should
increase to 11-12 percent of forest stock).
69.
•

•

Implementation of the above goals is further defined with specific actions:
Plan for the Implementation of President’s Directive #4 (Resolution #251/6 of the
Council of Ministers and the National Bank dated 28 February 2011) contains actions and
targets on structural reforms such as strengthening competition, improving the business
climate, removing red tape, strengthening the tax system and moving to international
financial reporting standards.
The Joint Plan of Action of the Council of Ministers and the National Bank (Resolution
#1150/17 of the Council of Ministers and the National Bank dated 13 December 2012)
seeks to meet the targets of social, economic, fiscal, and monetary policies set for 2013.
The Plan outlines a set of measures to improve the investment climate, encourage
economic modernization, launch high-technology manufacturing enterprises, and develop
small and medium-sized business. The Government intends to further reduce red tape for
both local and foreign investors and simplify the procedures of obtaining land for
investment projects.

70.
The Government believes that the challenges in the priority areas, if addressed,
would result in: (i) new and modernized jobs, reduced energy intensity, and expanded share of
services sector; (ii) expanded private sector and reduced administrative barriers to
entrepreneurship as testified by Belarus’s 30th position for ease of doing business in Doing
Business report; (iii) Belarus entering a group of 50 countries with the higher level of human
development; (iv) economic development at the average European level; and (v) social and
economic development targets achieved.
71.
This reform and growth agenda will dominate the Government’s demand for WBG’s
services over the medium term.

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIPSTRATEGY
A. Lessons Learned and Stakeholder Feedback
72.
The FY08-FY11 Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CAS CR) noted
that the WBG managed its program well in a high-risk country environment with an
uncertain structural reform implementation record. The CAS recognized that potential
benefits of stepped-up cooperation outweighed high macroeconomic and implementation risks,
and a decision was taken mid-stream to expand engagement in light of the global financial crisis
and progress in economic liberalization by the Government. As a result, the WBG, along with
the IMF and other partners, provided additional support to reinforce social protection, address
weaknesses in market pricing mechanisms, and strengthen budgetary process. Notwithstanding
the recognition that policy reforms supported through the Development Policy Loan (DPL) laid
the ground for future engagement in some areas, the WBG’s performance in designing and
managing CAS implementation is judged at moderately satisfactory, given the overall limited
sustainability on the policy front.
73.
On the other hand, the CAS CR gives a positive assessment to WBG’s responsiveness to
the crisis, good performance of the investment portfolio, and high-quality, timely and strategic
technical assistance and analytical support to the authorities.
74.
In particular, the CAS CR notes that the AAA program was instrumental in
building a dialogue with the Government in important policy areas (see Box 2). It noted that
high quality, relevant and data-based analysis established a foundation of trust in the dialogue
with the Government. A combination of deep analytical work with just-in-time advice and TA,
have resulted in solid analytical underpinnings for future reforms and a better understanding
among domestic and foreign stakeholders of the reform agenda and trade-offs ahead in Belarus.
Moreover, strategic sectoral AAA informed the World Bank's own interventions and current
thinking, in particular in transport sector, district heating and municipal services.
75.
Over the period of FY08-FY11 CAS, Belarus showed tangible progress on many
CAS outcomes. However, insufficient progress on several CAS supported development issues
was reflected in the moderately satisfactory program performance rating. Variability of results
was observed in the energy sector – from extremely successful projects in support of energy
efficiency and environmental protection that led to social and health benefits in schools,
kindergartens and other public institutions, to the lack of progress in tariff policy. Achievements
in other outcomes on public goods and services were also mixed, with good progress in transport
sector and less successful work in the water supply and sanitation program. The public sector
efficiency and governance agenda advanced in tax reforms and strengthened budgetary practices
but stalled in politically sensitive privatization. Belarus has made major advances in reducing the
cost of doing business, moving from 115th position in 2008 to 58th in 2010. Some, albeit far
from sufficient, progress was made in price liberalization. Modest goals set in the context of very
limited possibilities for WBG impact in financial sector development have been achieved as have
been social protection outcomes.
76.
The FY08-FY11CAS CR draws the following key lessons that have been taken into
account in designing the proposed CPS:
•

The new CPS should focus on critical priorities, adjusting the scope of the program and use
of instruments to the readiness of reforms and willingness of the authorities to implement
them. In doing this, the WBG will seek long-term engagement and maintain program
continuity. The Bank will also pay increased attention to a medium-term macroeconomic
framework to ensure sustainability of structural reform program supported by the WBG.
18

Box 1. Impact of AAA in Belarus – Some Examples
Recognizing that policy reforms remain critical to addressing the most important development challenges in Belarus,
the WBG has placed knowledge services at the core of its engagement. The AAA program has provided the
analytical foundation for and contributed to policy formulation and evidence-based policy debate and catalyzed
reforms in several policy areas. The policy dialogue built around core analytical reports, including a Programmatic
Public Expenditure Review (PER 1 and 2, 2011-13) and Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, 2012), which
were prepared and delivered through an interactive, collaborative process that informed policy discussions and
ensured relevance and impact of recommendations.
Structural Reforms: The CEM analyzed structural constraints in the current state-driven growth model and engaged
the authorities in a dialogue on the need for structural reforms, including price liberalization, SOE restructuring, and
creation of a conducive environment for private sector development. The Government has established a joint
structural reform working group co-led by the Ministry of Economy and the WBG, with participation of
governmental agencies and development partners, including the IMF, EU-ECFIN, and EBRD. Through this
mechanism the Government requested WBG’s advice on key policy issues such as price liberalization, bankruptcy
legislation, and removal of quantitative targets for SOEs.
Privatization: Through a Privatization Technical Assistance funded by the Government of Austria WBG has
supported the establishment of the National Agency for Investment and Privatization (NAIP). The Agency is now
working with the help from reputable financial advisors on attracting strategic investors for eight medium-sized
SOEs, using competitive, open and transparent tender methodology consistent with international good practice.
Fiscal Consolidation and Tax Reforms: The WBG supported the Government in undertaking fiscal consolidation in
the wake of the global financial crisis through the PER, which provided options for expenditure rationalization and
efficiency gains in core areas of the budget (macro-fiscal policy, energy, agriculture, social assistance, pensions,
education and health, tax reforms). The PER has reinforced the Government’s objective to rationalize expenditures,
starting with the most inefficient subsidies and to undertake tax reforms to gradually reduce tax burden on the
economy. The Government undertook a significant fiscal consolidation program, reducing the public expenditure to
GDP ratio from over 50 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 40 percent in 2012. At the same time, the Government
reformed the tax system, not only lowering overall tax burden, but also eliminating distortions (including eliminating
a local sales tax) and reducing marginal rates on both personal and corporate income taxes. In addition, the PER
opened up the policy dialogue on important topics, such as public utility pricing, and education and health financing.
Utility Tariff Reforms: The PER 1 analyzed the fiscal cost of provision of district heating, electricity and gas to
residential consumers at below cost recovery tariffs and also assessed the social impact of urgently needed tariff
increases. The analysis showed not only that fiscal cost is substantial, but also benefits of these subsidies are
regressive, disproportionately benefitting the wealthier segments of society. As one of the options, the PER
recommended the introduction of progressive tariff structures for electricity which would raise cost recovery and
reduce the regressivity of energy subsidies while cushion the impact of tariff increases for lower income households.
The Government adopted differentiated consumption-based gas and electricity tariffs, starting February 1, 2013.
Enhancing Efficiency of Education Financing: The analysis, conducted during preparation of PER 1 with the help
of a BOOST public expenditure tool, showed that the current input-based financing arrangements in education sector
have provided weak incentives (and limited authority) to rationalize the use of inputs and improve productivity,
service quality and outcomes. The PER 2 analyzed financing of education services and recommended reforms that
would strengthen incentives for efficiency in public service delivery. Following PER 2 delivery, the Belarus
authorities approached the Bank for advice on how to improve the effectiveness of their school optimization
program. The World Bank has responded to a Government request by launching a multi-year program of technical
assistance with the initial aim to help Belarus authorities implement per-student financing (PSF) pilots in 17 general
secondary schools in the cities of Minsk, Grodno, and Gomel. The Bank will also continue sharing with the
Government relevant international experiences, as well as train the Belarus counterparts in the use of data-driven
analytical techniques that can help design an effective funding formula that can be perfected before nationwide rollout. Under this engagement, the Bank will also provide assistance on appropriate school autonomy and
accountability mechanisms that will allow for an effective reform of the Belarus school financing regime.

19

•

AAA work will be critical in creating consensus in important policy areas and building
capacity and in preparing for lending operations. The WBG will continue offering analytical
work in response to real policy demand, and will apply an integrated approach in which
analytical and diagnostic work will be combined with just-in-time policy advice, capacity
building and lending.

•

In investment lending, the WBG should focus on sectors with an adequate or improving
policy framework, solid knowledge base, good implementation capacity and a track record of
successful cooperation in the past. Despite the relatively good performance of investment
projects, teams will be encouraged to pay extra attention to project design with due
consideration to the country’s policy cycle, local capacity, implementation readiness, and
engagement of project affected groups in project implementation and monitoring.

Findings from Client Surveys and Stakeholder Consultations
77.
The FY08-FY11 CAS CR discussions and CPS consultations were held with small
groups of targeted counterparts with day-to-day experience of working with the WBG,
business associations, civil society organizations, development partners and beneficiaries of
WBG-supported programs. The stakeholders shared their views regarding key priority areas
for the next four years and the role of the WBG in addressing them. The outcomes of the
meetings were important for outlining the CPS concept and developing a three-pillar approach. A
strategic dialogue with the Interministerial CPS Working Group provided a platform for
discussing the needs of the country and the way to address expectations in the framework of a
future partnership. Consultations with wider groups of multi-stakeholders across regions carried
out in January-April 2013 focused on economic competitiveness, human development,
improvement of infrastructure services, global public goods, and governance and gender
78.
Overall, participants in the consultations agreed with the CPS approach and
rationale and outlined the following key areas of focus for the WBG partnership with
Belarus: quality of life, municipal sector services, education and employment, private sector
development, efficiency of resource allocation, public administration, climate change, renewable
energy, forestry and agriculture. Stakeholders emphasized the importance of taking into account
the specifics of the country, providing technical assistance and advice, and sharing regional and
global expertise and knowledge. Representatives of the civil society proposed to include
information and awareness raising components in every project and to develop instruments for
beneficiaries’ engagement in monitoring and assessing the provision of services in projects
supported by the WBG, thus contributing to improving results and enhancing dialogue with
authorities and service providers on the needs of beneficiaries.
79.
While reviewing the lessons of projects completed during the FY08-FY11 CAS, the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) emphasized the importance for program success of
ensuring the Government’s commitment, selecting projects with visible economic and social
benefits, and quantifying outcome indicators at design stage. IEG also pointed out significance
of associated technical assistance and sufficient capacity development to carry out reform
programs. Proper macroeconomic framework was noted as critical for the medium-term
effectiveness of WBG-supported reforms.
80.
In January 2013, a client survey about stakeholders’ views of the World Bank and
its work in Belarus identified a significant role for the WBG in Belarus and suggested areas
for improvement in the medium term. One hundred ninety stakeholders – drawn from a range
of central and local state institutions, implementing agencies, civil society, media, private sector,
academia, beneficiaries and development partners – were invited to provide their opinions on the
20

Bank’s assistance to the country. A total of one hundred fifteen stakeholders completed the
survey (61 percent response rate).
81.
Overall results suggest that private sector development and such areas as economic
growth, competitiveness and diversification, FDI, SOE, and energy efficiency are perceived
to be the top development priorities for the country, and key drivers to improving people’s
lives in Belarus. Opinion leaders see a critical role for the Bank in these top priority areas and
areas related to public sector reform, social protection, and environmental sustainability in terms
of Bank financial resources and knowledge products. These results are consistent with the
priorities identified in this CPS and the findings of the CAS Completion Report.
82.
The WBG has a meaningful role to play in generating knowledge. While two thirds
of respondents believe that the WBG’s most effective instrument in helping to promote
development and reduce poverty in Belarus is investment lending, the survey findings suggest
that technical assistance, capacity development, and knowledge products are valued highly in the
country.

B. World Bank Group Partnership Strategy Overview
Calibrated Assistance
83.
In response to the risk of reversal of policy reforms and reflecting the lessons learnt
from the previous CAS, the WBG proposes to calibrate its program against the depth,
breath and speed of structural reforms. The program will include Analytical and Advisory
Activities (AAA), investment lending by the Bank and investments in the private sector by IFC.
Should structural reforms accelerate, lending scope and instruments could be revisited at midterm of the CPS period.
84.
The WBG’s AAA program will be critical in creating consensus in important policy
areas, building capacity and laying the analytical foundation for lending operations in the
country. Core diagnostics around critical developmental issues will continue, including
structural reforms, fiscal, PFM, trade, WTO accession, private and financial sector development.
These AAA engagements - many of them of a programmatic nature - will underpin the policy
dialogue in critical reform areas, supporting the Government in designing and implementing
policies to achieve stated objectives of economic modernization and strengthened
competiveness. AAA activities in such areas as municipal services, forestry, education and
health will underpin future investment operations.
85.
In the new CPS, World Bank’s investment lending will focus on sectors with adequate
and improving policy framework, sufficient knowledge base, solid implementation track record
and demonstrated government commitment, direct benefits to ordinary citizens and/or global
public goods benefits. This includes energy efficiency and municipal utilities where we have ongoing operations with good track record of implementation as well as PFM, forestry and
education, new sectors where: 1) we have established a solid knowledge base through our recent
and on-going AAA, and 2) there is an active policy dialogue and demonstrated government
commitment to undertake policy reforms.

Expected Results and Program of Lending and Non-Lending Activities
86.
The WBG Strategy will respond to the development constraints and possibilities
outlined above by focusing on three key areas of reform and investment that could help
improve: (1) competitiveness of the economy by supporting structural reforms, including
reducing the role of the state, transforming the SOE sector, promoting private and financial
sector development and integration into the global economy; (2) quality and efficiency of public
infrastructure services, use of agricultural and forestry resources, and global benefits of public
21

goods; and (3) human development outcomes through better education, health and social
services.

Pillar 1: Improving Competitiveness of the Economy by Supporting Structural
Reforms, Including Reducing the Role of the State, Transforming the SOE Sector,
Promoting Private and Financial Sector Development and Integration into the Global
Economy
World Bank Group contributing to:
Result Area 1:
Economic stability and competitiveness
Result Area 2:
Deepening financial intermediation on market-based terms
Result Area 3:
Liberalized environment for private sector investment
87.
The CPS will address the need for structural reforms to allow Belarus to maintain
stability, regain competitiveness, and diversify and modernize its economy, allowing
enterprises to dynamically adapt to the evolving demands of the global economy (see
paragraphs 37-45 above). The CPS will accordingly contribute to an improved
environment for private sector growth through support for economic stability and
competitiveness, strengthened financial sector, and a liberalized environment for private sector
investment.
88.
The three outcomes will also be supported through a number of more specific
interventions from both the Bank and IFC.

Result Area 1: Economic stability and competitiveness
89.
Belarus has suffered in the recent past from a severe macroeconomic crisis, and
growth and employment creation are currently being undermined by decreasing competitiveness,
caused both by rising real wages and stagnant productivity, and by the opening of Russia’s
markets after its WTO accession (paragraphs 33-36 above). The CPS proposes to help address
both problems.
90.
Overall support for these aims would be provided through a Programmatic Structural
Reform AAA(Technical Assistance (TA), FY13-15), which would anchor the dialogue and
technical assistance on structural reforms, including further price liberalization, regulatory
reforms, and SOE transformation reforms. The task will deliver several analytical and policy
notes as well as training and capacity building events. An integrated Trade Policy/WTO
Accession AAA (TA, FY13-15) would provide technical assistance to support Belarus in its
effort to join the WTO. The task would comprise technical and policy notes on key aspects of
WTO accession, inter alia on the economic impact of WTO accession, implications for financial
service regulation, and system of state support.
91.
The CPS would contribute to economic stability necessary for investor confidence
through its Fiscal Policy Dialogue AAA (TA, FY13-15). This task would continue to provide
targeted analytical and advisory services to support fiscal reforms to enhance fiscal stabilization
within a consistent macroeconomic framework, to ensure fiscal and debt sustainability and to
provide for growth supporting expenditure and revenue policies. The task would deliver a series
of technical notes, reports and training events.
92.
The CPS would support improvements in the management of Government finances
through a Public Financial Management (Loan, FY15, USD100 million) – the project could
also include a component for customs modernization. The project is expected to improve
transparency and efficiency of public financial management and strengthen accountability of the
22

Government for the use of public funds. It would support improvements in procedures for
national budget planning, execution, accounting and reporting through review of existing
methodologies in those areas and their alignment with applicable international standards and
good practices. The project would also support modernization of the tools used by the Ministry
of Finance and its subordinate units for processing, consolidation and analysis of financial
management information to make it more accessible for specialists, decision makers and general
public.
93.
In addition, the Regional Development AAA (Analytic/Advisory, FY15) would deliver
a regional development report for Belarus, assessing economic geography, agglomeration of
economic activity and sectors, labor markets and internal migration. The report would assess
potential impact of structural reforms across different parts of the country and recommend policy
options.
94.
A Trade Finance Program (TA, IFC, FY14) would extend and complement the
capacity of banks to deliver trade finance. The program would give priority support to trade
flows that promote critical sectors such as agriculture and energy efficiency, while maintain
strategic focus on SME importers and exporters and trade between emerging markets.

Result Area 2: Deepening financial intermediation on market-based terms
95.
Better access to finance is key to improved competitiveness of Belarusian economy
(paragraph 42 above). A Financial Sector Policy Dialogue AAA (TA, FY13-16) is providing
just-in-time policy advice and TA to NBRB on deepening market-based financial intermediation
while making the sector more resilient to possible shocks. The agenda discussed with NBRB
includes financial consumer protection and financial literacy, regulation of non-bank financial
institutions, and development of market-based mortgage instruments to substitute for declining
volume of subsidized housing programs. With an improved policy framework, the dialogue
could expand to cover topics such as restructuring of state-owned banks, financial sector stability
framework, and enhancing bank supervision.
96.
Private sector growth is significantly impeded by lack of affordable finance (paragraph
42 above). The CPS would support improved private sector access to finance through the
MSME Lending Program (IFC Financing, FY14). The program is designed to provide
funding to MSME market in the form of long-term debt finance. IFC advisory program experts
may also advise the banks on best practice tools on how to assess risks in lending to MSMEs, as
well as help with risk management procedures. At the request of the authorities, the Bank will
undertake a modular Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) (Analytic, FY14)
focusing on the development of non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFI) sector (microfinance,
credit unions, leasing, etc.).

Result Area 3: Liberalized environment for private sector investment
97.
Belarus suffers from a generally poor environment for private business (paragraph 41
above). The CPS will support improvements in the business environment and in business
services. A Regulatory Simplification, Investment Climate Improvement Program (TA,
IFC, Ongoing) is helping to expand the private sector and increase FDI in Belarus through
improved regulatory policies and strengthened institutions, would continue to advise the
Government on implementing policy reforms in regulatory simplification (permits, inspections,
licenses), secured transactions and debt resolution, and investment generation. In addition,
potential delivery instruments to support the private MSME sector could include TA or
investment loan to provide matching grant facility and/or line of credit through qualified
commercial banks and/or microfinance institutions.
23

98.
A Sector-Specific Business Regulation Project (TA, IFC, FY15) would build on the
previous achievements of IFC’s investment climate work which resulted in broad-based reforms
of procedures for obtaining permits and licenses, inspections, technical regulations, insolvency.
Sectors (e.g. agriculture, forestry) would be selected based on their importance to the economy
and competitive advantages that would allow Belarus to become a leading producer and exporter
of agricultural and forest commodities in the world. The program would aim to develop
transparent and consistent regulations to create a more attractive investment climate for domestic
and foreign investors, leading to sustainable future growth of the sectors.
99.
A Pilot SOE Privatization TA Project (Austrian Trust Fund, FY13-16, ongoing)
would continue to provide advisory services to the Ministry of Economy and National Agency
for Investment and Privatization to support tender privatization of select medium-sized SOEs
using international best practice. In the event of a successful outcome of the pilot transactions, it
is expected that the program could be scaled up by the authorities, including changes in the
legislative regime for privatization.
100. If overall investment climate improves and reform advances to a point where SOE
privatization is expected to include larger enterprises, IFC could support select SOEs through
pre-privatization investments. Through its involvement IFC can improve governance and help
the investees adopt best practice standards, including in environmental and social areas, reporting
and governance, thus contributing to more successful privatizations.
101. The Government of Belarus sees a high potential in the private information and
communications technology (ICT) sector becoming one of the pillar industries driving growth in
FDI and export of services. Furthermore, introduction of ICT systems would be critical to
support WTO accession. The Bank will consider providing support in introduction of ICT
infrastructure within public sector.

Pillar 2: Improved Efficiency and Quality of Public Infrastructure Services,
Enhancedand Sustainable Use of Agricultural and Forestry Resources and Increased
Global Public Good Benefits
World Bank Group contributing to:
Result Area 1:
Enhanced energy security and efficiency of resource use
Result Area 2:
Improved standards in agriculture and forestry sectors
Result Area 3:
Improved public infrastructure and municipal public utility
102. Growth sustainability is also constrained by deteriorating infrastructure, inefficient
use of energy, and significant unrealized economic potential of the country’s natural
resources, particularly forestry (see paragraphs 47-57 above). The CPS will address these
constraints by supporting efforts to improve energy security, raise efficiency of the use of natural
resources, and provide better and more cost-effective public services.

Result Area 1: Enhanced energy security and efficiency of resource use
103. Belarus’s economy and fiscal balance are compromised by high energy use and an overdependence on a single source of imports (paragraphs 49-52 above). The CPS will contribute to
improved energy security and efficiency of resource use through a number of initiatives. There
will be three areas of focus:
104. Energy Efficiency: The Energy Efficiency Project (Loan, FY10, USD125 million and
Additional Financing FY13, USD90 million) is supporting improved energy efficiency in heat
and power generation in selected towns in Belarus. The Project is aligned with priorities of the
24

Belarus national energy programs to improve energy security and to reduce dependency on
energy imports. The Post-Chernobyl Recovery Additional Financing (FY11, USD30 million)
is providing the population residing in the Chernobyl affected area with energy efficient and
reliable heat and hot water services in order to improve their living environment and provide
clean and improved space heating to households that were burning wood inside homes with
potential negative environmental and health consequences. The Energy Efficiency Project
(IFC Finance, FY14-15) will support funding of projects leading to improvements in energy
efficiency, through providing banks with longer-term funding and advisory support for
development of energy efficiency and SME banking products.
105. Renewables: The Biomass-based District Heating TA (FY13, on-going) identifies and
analyzes available least-cost heat supply options, namely increased use of biomass energy for
heat production and associated energy efficiency measures. The results of the study will be used
to identify the scope of a Biomass District Heating Project (Loan, FY14, USD 90 million) to
increasing use of renewable biomass and improving energy efficiency of district heating systems.
While the project is targeting the supply side of district heating, it is complemented by an
ongoing Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) assessing affordability of proposed
energy tariff reforms as well as energy efficiency and renewable energy measures available to
reduce the cost of energy (in particular heat) supply.
106. In addition, the Renewable Energy Project (IFC Finance, FY15) will support private
companies engaged in the generation of alternative sources of energy.
107. Resource Efficiency: The Resource Efficiency Financing (IFC and Ministry of
Finance of Austria, FY11-16, On-going and Regional) will seek to stimulate investment into
uptake of resource-efficient (REF) technologies and best practices; to improve management
processes and operational practices in industry across all sectors; and to raise awareness among
policy makers and financial institutions. The Sub-National Finance Project (IFC Finance,
FY16) would build on successful sub-national experience in the region and support reform
oriented sub-national entities in the areas of infrastructure upgrading, with a particular focus on
resource efficiency.

Result Area 2: Improved standards in agriculture and forestry sectors
108. Belarus’s agricultural sector is sub-optimal and a drag on the budget. There is also
great potential for more effective use of forest and other environmental resources (paragraphs
53-57 above). The CPS will support improvements in agricultural output and efficiency, food
safety, and forest management.
109. Agriculture: The Agriculture Project (IFC Finance, FY15) will support private
operators in agriculture, especially the dairy sector, throughout the supply chain to address the
main bottlenecks to the sector’s growth and to generate broad sectoral impact. The emphasis
will be on projects which maximize impact, through demonstration effect and linkages to local
producers. Investments can be accompanied by advisory work to improve the investment climate
for agribusiness and bring food safety standards to an international level. In addition, the
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grant for Strengthening Capacity for Monitoring of
Agricultural Policy Instruments (TA, on-going, FY11-15) is supporting the Government’s
review of current arrangement for monitoring and evaluation of agricultural policy drawing on
European experience, providing training in analytical methods for policy analysis and applying
these skills to the analyses of policies initially in the dairy sector.
110. Forestry: Since satisfactory completion of the WBG’s first involvement in Belarus’s
forest sector (the Forestry Development Project) in 2003, the WBG has continued its engagement
in the sector through technical assistance funded by the EU through the Forest Law Enforcement
and Governance (FLEG) Program. On-going support includes FLEG II (TA, EU TF, FY13-17)
25

implemented by the WB in partnership with two international NGOs (World Conservation Fund
(IUCN) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF)). The FLEG Program (starting with FLEG I from
2008-12 and continuing with FLEG II from 2013-17) is supporting the formulation and
implementation of forest policy, legal, administrative and institutional reforms, including support
in the preparation of Belarus’s new Strategic Forest Development Plan to 2030. A Forest Policy
Note (ESW, FY13) provides strategic advice to help define sector goals, aims and opportunities
for consideration in the preparation of the Strategic Forest Development Plan and helps identify
potential areas for support to the sector. In addition, the Forest Management Improvement
Project (Loan, FY15, USD40 million) will support strengthening of forestry protection and
forest fire prevention, production of alternative energy (wood-chip fuel); and introducing new
technologies for forest harvesting.
111. Agriculture and Forestry: The IFC’s Sector-Specific Business Regulation TA (see
paragraph 97 above) would support reforms of procedures for obtaining permits and licenses,
inspections, technical regulations, insolvency in sectors including agriculture and forestry.
112. Food Safety: The Food Safety Project (IFC Advisory Services, FY10-13, USD1.25
million with Ministry of Finance of Austria) aims to increase competitiveness and export
opportunities of Belarus food processors by improving existing food safety standards and
building capacity of the local food safety inspectors and experts. This activity will continue to
provide advisory services to Belarusian private food processors to facilitate the uptake of
internationally recognized standards through raising awareness of the standards, training food
safety consultants, and providing in-depth assistance to clients. If brought up to international
food safety and quality standards, the Belarusian food industry could accommodate significant
export market growth which will help increase Belarus’s trade and subsequently enhance the
country’s economic development.

Result Area 3: Improved public infrastructure and municipal public utility services
113. Belarus has deteriorating infrastructure with high operating costs (paragraphs 46-47
above). The CPS will support improvements in efficiency, quality and sustainability of
municipal and communal public utility services.
114. Water Supply and Sanitation: The Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Loan, FY09
USD60 million and Additional Financing, FY14, USD60 million) would together support
improvements in access to water supply and quality of water and wastewater services. The FY09
Project has been focusing on upgrade of wastewater treatment systems serving 600,000 people,
on improvement of water quality for more than 300,000 urban dwellers, and on extension of
water supply systems to 8,000 people. The proposed FY14 Additional Financing will support
similar objectives, with a specific focus on development of additional wastewater treatment
facilities. These projects are supported by the Municipal Water Sector Review (Analytic,
FY13, ongoing) whose objective is to formulate sector modernization recommendations
addressing service efficiency and sustainability challenges. The analysis is also seeking to find
the most efficient ways to enhance interface between utilities and users to promote transparency
of services delivery and tariffs and feedback mechanisms on service provision. This effort
would also reduce governance risks and increase results orientation of the projects.
115. Municipal
Services:
The
Municipal
Services
Performance
Review
(Analytic/Advisory, FY15) would provide evidence-based policy recommendations targeted at
strengthening delivery outcomes, environmental performance and sustainability of services
provided by Belarus sub-national government entities. The AAA would assess (i) access,
quality, and customer satisfaction with municipal services and (ii) financial and environmental
sustainability and efficiency of service provision. This would also include a review of the subnational finance framework to assess revenue, transfer and expenditure position of public utilities
26

and communal service departments. An assessment of the enabling environment affecting
municipal service performance, such as sector institutional framework and governance structure,
and review of options for private sector participation in selected service areas would also be
included.
116. Waste Management: The Integrated Solid Waste Management Project (Loan, FY10,
USD42.5 million) supports improving municipal service provision and increasing environmental
benefits by recovering and reusing recyclable materials. The loan finances (i) establishment of a
Materials Recovery Facility and (ii) upgrading of the separate waste collection system in the City
of Grodno. A waste separation and collection improvement plan was prepared and adopted by
the City of Grodno. Coverage of the city’s recycling system would be expanded to provide 100
percent of the population with access to separate waste collection services. Waste disposed at
landfill would be reduced by an estimated 20,000 tons per year as a result of waste source
separation and material recovery. Specific information and feedback mechanisms will be created
and institutionalized to ensure sustainability of project results and monitor project beneficiaries’
satisfaction. The POPs Stockpile Management Project (GEF, FY10, USD5.5 million) has
been strengthening national capacity to manage hazardous wastes associated with Persistent
Organic Pollutants (POPs). The project will reduce environmental and health risks associated
with the presence and release of POPs in the local and global environments.
117. The Roads Project (Loan, FY10, USD150 million) is an ongoing project which
upgrades a section of the European road corridor IX from a two-lane road to a four-lane
motorway. It also helps the Government to address the problem of road deterioration due to
overloaded trucks, by introducing a modern axle load monitoring and control system.

Pillar 3: Improved Human Development Outcomes through Better Delivery
ofEducation, Health and Social Services
World Bank Group contributing to:
Result Area 1:
Improved social protection and greater labor market efficiency
Result Area 2:
Increased efficiency of health and education services delivery
118. Belarus’s social service delivery systems, while providing widely accessible and
affordable social protection, health and education services, are costly and inefficient. The
CPS will support better and more cost-effective education, health and social protection service
with the aim of improving human development outcomes.

Result Area 1: Improved social protection
119. Belarus’s social protection system provides a wide range of benefits, but has a very low
share of targeted programs; it also does not provide for adequate unemployment insurance
needed to mitigate the social impact of structural reforms (paragraph 66 above). The CPS would
support better social protection and improved mobility in the labor market through an
Employment/Labor Market AAA (TA, FY13-15), which will make optimal use of Labor
Force Survey (LFS) data and carry out detailed and comprehensive labor market analysis. This
would underpin further engagement in strengthening unemployment protection in Belarus and
assess potential for introduction of unemployment insurance, expanding active labor market
policies, and enhancing the capacity of the national employment service to use labor market data
for policy design. A series of capacity building activities will be organized, starting with training
in Automated DEC Poverty Tables for Labor Market Analysis (ADEPT LM) for Government
counterparts and local think tanks. Institutional assessment of Belarusian public employment
services and active labor market policies would be another important task to prepare the
27

Government to cushion the impact of restructuring and labor shedding. Furthermore, the TA
would produce an engagement note on the challenges posed by the demographic transition and
increased longevity. It will analyze the impact of the demographic transition on the size and
composition of the Belarus labor force, policy scenarios to stem the demographic decline, and
implications for productivity growth, skills development, and social policies such as
employment, long-term care, health and pension policies. The note would aim to inform policy
makers about the nature of the coming changes, identify possible policy areas for reform, and
discuss areas of further cooperation.
120. Based on the engagement note and depending on interest shown by the Government in
subsequent discussions, the CPS could include a Long-Term Care AAA (ESW, FY15-16)
which would focus on development of long-term care services. The study may be used to outline
further path for reforms in residential care (de-institutionalization), pensions, and health care
services.
121. The CPS would be prepared to support strengthened social protection through structural
reforms in social assistance and pension domains if the Government’s commitment to reform
warrants. A Social Protection AAA (TA) would provide technical advice to improve targeting
of the social assistance and to ensure sustainability of the Pay-As-You-Go pension system in the
medium and long term.

Result Area 2: Increased efficiency of health and education services delivery
122. Both health and education sectors suffer from poor outcomes in relation to the resources
committed to them (paragraphs 60-65 above). The CPS would support strengthening of health
services for better health outcomes through an Improving Quality of Care Programmatic
AAA (TA, FY14-16), which will (i) contribute to align the health care delivery system to
existing needs and changed epidemiological and demographic profile; help Government develop
new non-communicable diseases’ prevention and control strategies; (iii) contribute to enhance
quality of care in the health sector by updating and expanding the national protocols and clinical
guidelines by level of care (“care pathways”) to standardize care processes, reducing the
variability in clinical practice and improving outcomes; (iv) contribute to establish functioning
long-term care sector with a focus on de-institutionalization of patients, on care coordination
between the health and social sector under the principle of money following the patient, and on
building-up of community-based social services for the elderly. To this end, a series of capacity
building activities will be organized, starting with the Mogilev Oblast authorities, who will be
conducting a pilot project starting in 2014.
123. In education, the Government has requested Bank support on efficiency reforms in the
general education subsector. In response to this request, the CPS would include a
Programmatic Education AAA (TA, FY14-15), which will (i) bring best practices from
regional experience in per-student financing (PSF) to Belarus; (ii) assess the feasibility of school
network optimization and simulate potential efficiency gains; (iii) assist in designing and piloting
the PSF formula in up to 3 cities/oblasts; (iv) build capacity among education and finance
authorities to monitor and evaluate the piloting of the formula and identify formula adjustments,
as needed; (v) advise on the appropriate legal framework necessary for reform to increase school
budget autonomy; and undertake other related activities. If the reform process advances
successfully, the CPS would support continued improvements in education sector quality and
efficiency through an Education Services Transformation Project (Loan, USD50 million,
FY15/FY16)that would support national rollout of PSF by: (i) preparing receiving schools for
inflow of students from optimized schools; (ii) providing training and methodological support to
local authorities and school principals and accountants; (iii) strengthening national systems
28

needed to monitor the impact of reform, including development of student assessments to gauge
education quality.

IV. IMPLEMENTING THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
A.

Proposed Lending and Knowledge Program

124. Implementation of the existing portfolio will determine achievement of majority of
CPS outcomes. The current investment lending portfolio includes five operations, totaling USD
457 million, with about 53.0 percent to be disbursed. Most of the ongoing projects were
approved at mid-point of the previous CAS in 2009-2010, in response to initial market-oriented
reforms and global financial crisis. The entry of new investment projects into a small portfolio
resulted in a reduced disbursement ratio at the end of the previous CAS. Additionally,
insufficient implementation readiness, limited capacity of the new implementing agencies and
impact of the financial crisis caused implementation delays in two projects: Water Supply and
Sanitation and Integrated Solid Waste Management. Implementation hurdles have been
overcome in the Water Supply and Sanitation project, while work is still underway to bridge
implementation gap in Integrated Solid Waste Management project. Overall portfolio
performance has improved steadily in the past year as a result of intense focus by the Bank and
Government on portfolio management, which included semi-annual Country Portfolio
Performance Reviews (CPPRs) which set time-bound action plans for each project and the
portfolio as a whole, regular monitoring of procurement milestones and disbursements and active
restructuring. As of April 2013, overall portfolio disbursement ratio reached 28 percent.
125. The World Bank’s lending program for FY14-15 will play an important role in
achieving the CPS outcomes and envisages a total of about USD380 million in investment
loans (Table 2). New lending has been identified for the first two years of the CPS, while the
lending scope and specific projects for the outer years will be defined in the CPS Progress Report
based on evolution of country’s demand and priorities as well as pace in implementation of
sectoral and structural reforms. Additional Financing to the ongoing Energy Efficiency project
(USD90 million) is FY13 deliverable but is expected to become effective in FY14 and, therefore,
included in the list of new activities. Investment lending pipeline for FY14 includes Additional
Financing to the on-going Water Supply and Sanitation project and a Biomass-based District
Heating project. In addition, two projects are envisaged in FY15: PFM Modernization and
Forest Management Improvement. Additionally, an Education Services Transformation
project will be considered for delivery in either FY15 or FY16depending on progress in sector
reforms and implementation of piloted PSF mechanism. In FY16-17, investment lending may be
considered in: (i) health and education; (ii) municipal services, including energy efficiency; (iii)
transport; (iv) private sector development and competitiveness, and (v) agriculture.
126. IFC annual commitments for FY14-15 are planned to total up to USD70 million per
annum and will contribute to achieving CPS outcomes under Pillars 1 and 2. Under Pillar
1, IFC will continue to provide finance in the framework of Global Trade Finance Program
(GTFP) and extend support to MSMEs through local commercial banks. Under Pillar 2, IFC will
consider energy efficiency finance programs aimed at stimulating energy efficiency investments
through bank guarantees and advisory services.
127. The WBG’s AAA program will be critical for achieving the CPS outcomes under all
3 Pillars (Table 2). AAA will focus on advice in key policy areas such as structural reforms,
trade, fiscal, PFM, private and financial sector development, and municipal services. A number
of earlier started TA activities will continue in support of sectoral dialogue in privatization,
forestry, and agriculture and in new areas, in particular, in health and education, to build the
knowledge base and policy environment for new lending. IFC Advisory Services, seeking to
expand the private sector and increase FDI in Belarus through improved regulatory policies and
29

strengthened institutions, would continue to advise the Government on implementing policy
reforms in regulatory simplification (permits, inspections, licenses), reforms on secured
transactions and debt resolution, and investment generation. This program would build on the
previous achievements of IFC’s investment climate work which resulted in broad-based reforms
of procedures for obtaining permits and licenses, inspections, technical regulations, insolvency.
128. Trust Funds resources made notable contribution to the FY08-11CAS outcomes as
they were closely integrated into the core program of the WBG, linked to the analytical work and
responded to country priorities, including strengthening institutional capacity and contributing to
a dialogue on tackling present macroeconomic vulnerabilities and advancing economic
liberalization; increasing efficiency of resource allocation, building statistical capacity,
addressing energy efficiency and renewable energy, hazardous waste management, and forestry
and agriculture issues.
129. The Trust Funds portfolio increased to seventeen grants totaling USD16 million in
FY13, managed by the Bank and IFC, up from four programs totaling USD 3.5 million in FY08
and four programs totaling USD2.2 million in FY10. Partnership with other donors resulted in
leveraging funds for technical assistance and advisory services but also for project preparation
and co-financing, including financing from United States Agency for International Development
(USAID), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Danish Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, Federal Ministry of Finance of Austria, multilateral grant facilities, such as
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), Strengthening Accountability and
the Fiduciary Environment (SAFE), and grants from trust fund for Statistical Capacity Building
(TFSCB), Institutional Development Fund (IDF) and Global Environment Facility (GEF).
130. The WBG will continue efforts to enhance the role of Trust Funds in leveraging the
WBG resources and contributing to the CPS outcomes. Trust fund activities will support a
number of priorities under the CPS pillars, including fiscal governance, consumer protection and
financial literacy, labor force survey, regulatory simplification and investment generation,
private enterprise development and privatization, promotion of public-private partnerships in
municipal sector, increasing use of renewable energy and resource-efficient technologies,
improving forest law enforcement and governance, and enhancing monitoring and evaluation of
agricultural policy instruments and agricultural competitiveness.
131. The Results Matrix is based on the existing program and the activities proposed for
the first two years of the CPS. The Progress Report will expand the results framework based
on evolution of the WBG engagement and activities for the remaining years of the CPS.
132. While reflecting strategic country development goals in areas supported by the
WBG, the CPS results framework will ensure clear attribution between WBG-financed
activities and CPS outcomes. In particular, as noted by the CAS CR, this CPS will pay greater
attention to realism of CPS outcomes and will establish more direct linkages between the WBGsupported activities and influence they had on advancing the country development goals.

B.

Managing Program Implementation

Implementation Readiness
133. Incorporating lessons from the CAS CR, the CPS will place additional attention on
implementation capacity and quality at entry, in particular on procurement readiness of
investment projects. In this CPS, preference will be given to activities that build on successful
projects where ownership is clear and implementation capacity is in place. Greater emphasis
will be given to the analytical grounding of investment operations. The AAA program - many of
which have started in FY11-FY13 – will underpin future investment activities, in particular in
PFM, municipal services, forestry, and health and education. In case of first-time borrowers,
capacity-building will be built into project design during preparation, and disbursement and
implementation schedule will be aligned with capacity-building in procurement and contract
management.
134. Increased emphasis on procurement readiness, with realistic advance planning of
procurement and close downstream contract management, will ensure that implementation
and disbursement can start soon after project effectiveness. Additionally, semi-annual joint
CPPRs will continue to be used to monitor portfolio performance and resolve implementation
bottlenecks and combined with regular on-the-ground, hands-on implementation support by task
teams and proactive use of restructurings.
Operationalizing Governance
135. Increased attention will be paid to governance issues and social accountability
across the entire program. Entry points for sector engagement will be determined based on: (i)
quality of policy framework in the sector; (ii) Government commitment/demand; (iii) capacity of
state and non-state institutions; and (iv) potential impact on improving transparency and social
accountability of decision-making. For example, following these principles, lending pipeline for
FY14-15 offers either scaled-up support to sectors with established capacity and solid
implementation record in the past, or proposes new lending in areas such as PFM and forestry
where ownership and capacity exist.
136. At the project level, the CPS proposes to use a GAC filter for lending operations,
trust funds, and major AAA to examine GAC-related implementation risks and their
influence on country outcomes. It will be applied at pre-concept, design, and implementation
stages and will ensure that GAC issues are given appropriate attention, risks are identified and
mitigation measures discussed early on. The filter is intended to guide management and teams
on the kinds of issues that should be given particular attention. The filter was introduced in the
Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Country Department at the time of the Ukraine CPS FY12-16,
and is an adaptation of the Operational Risk Assessment Framework (ORAF) to the governance
circumstances in the country.
137. Use of GAC filter will help integrate analysis of GAC related risks in operations and
ensure systematic risk-based decision-making across the portfolio. At pre-concept stage,
before significant WBG resources are committed, GAC risks and benefits of proposed operations
are identified and discussed, using a set of guiding questions summarized in Annex 6. This stage
will focus on the most salient risks and opportunities, as well as a recommended course of
action; for example, additional GAC or political economy diagnostics, demand-side initiatives,
and other design features could be advised. In some cases, it may be recommended not to pursue
the proposed activity further. At later stages, GAC filter will be used to review the evolution of
risks during project preparation and to assess the effectiveness of efforts to manage GAC risks
during implementation.

32

138. Engagement on governance issues through policy dialogue will continue on the most
crucial reform issues for the Government to consider. In particular, the WBG will support
Government’s efforts to improve long-term public finance sustainability through public finance
and fiscal governance reforms, including spending adjustment and efficiency (primarily, in
health and education; social protection; and intergovernmental fiscal relations), and debt
management. It will also continue dialogue on transition to a new growth model, including
reform of SOEs, and private sector governance. The ongoing work on municipal services will
support Government’s efforts to further improve quality of public service delivery.
139. Demand-side governance engagement will focus on participatory monitoring,
encouraging accountability to the beneficiaries through transparency and empowerment.
Participatory monitoring will allow for active participation of project beneficiaries, communities
and other primary stakeholders in project design and implementation and monitoring of project
outcomes. A focused portfolio review will be undertaken in FY13 to identify the most
appropriate social accountability tools to increase project effectiveness and development impact.
The review will identify social accountability instruments and approaches tailored to project
needs and country context, and will ensure their integration into the World Bank portfolio by
applying social accountability-linked indicators in operations, as well as identifying
opportunities for the use of beneficiary surveys and feedback. For example, specific information
sharing and feedback mechanisms will be created and institutionalized to ensure sustainability of
project results and monitor project beneficiaries’ satisfaction as well as enhanced compliance
with the right to information.
140. CPS activities will also involve civil society in a proactive way, particularly to
support their role in governance and social accountability. CPS activities will support
dialogue between civil society, authorities, and public agencies through: (i) proactive
information dissemination,(ii) capacity building, and (ii) civil society involvement in Monitoring
and Evaluation (M&E) activities. The CPS will build on the Global Partnership for Social
Accountability to help broaden accountability of public institutions at the national and local
level.
Gender
141. In response to the challenges identified in paragraphs 30-32 above, the WBG will
continue addressing gender issues through its financing, analytical work and technical
assistance. In particular, analysis under the Programmatic PER, including on long-term fiscal
sustainability of the pension and healthcare systems in the context of projected demographic
changes, situation with non-communicable diseases, efficiency and sustainability of pension
system and health care, suggests specific reform options to confront challenges and ensure higher
impact of social services. Introduction of a regular LFS containing gender-disaggregated data
would allow improved gender statistics. Financial Sector TA supporting the national financial
literacy program is expected to result in increased use of financial services by women, including
for business purposes.
142. Gender lenses will be applied in all operations aiming to identify gender disparities in
endowments and economic opportunities in selected areas of development and suggest possible
ways of addressing such most critical gaps through WBG-supported activities. Building on the
current WBG program, possible focus areas could be equal participation of women in the labor
force and entrepreneurship, curbed male mortality rate linked to non-communicable diseases and
hazardous lifestyle, sustainability of the pension and healthcare systems, and higher impact of
social services.

Partnerships and Donor Coordination
143. The proposed WBG strategy has been designed in close coordination with other
development partners. Throughout the process of FY08-11 CAS implementation, the WBG’s
team collaborated closely with a number of development partners, including the IMF, European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), EU, Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), SIDA,
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), US Agency for International Development
(USAID), and other bilateral donors. In the new CPS the WBG will continue seeking
partnerships on key policy issues, technical assistance and advice. The WBG would aim to
further leverage partnerships to: (i) share more systematically the findings of economic and
sector work (ESW) with other partners, (ii) undertake joint ESW/TA whenever possible, and (iii)
leverage other donors' resources.
144. The WBG and the IMF teams will continue working closely in calibrating and
delivering their assistance. The IMF plays a key role at the macro level, while the WBG
focuses on the structural reform agenda, energy efficiency, infrastructure and social and
environmental issues. Recent examples of close cooperation and coordination between the WBG
and the Fund include discussions under the IMF SBA post program monitoring and during the
preparation of the CEM, and joint work with the Government Working Group on structural
reform issues, and the joint support in the development of a Medium-Term Debt Strategy
(MTDS). Areas of shared responsibility between the Bank and the Fund include macroeconomic
development, public expenditure management, debt management and financial sector.
145. The WBG closely coordinates its activities with the EU through the Bank/EU Day,
regular consultations through the meetings organized by the EU, participation in the European
Dialogue and managing regional programs (FLEG and REPARIS/STAR-EaP). On bilateral
basis the WBG works with the Government of Austria on (i) a pilot project to launch and roll out
a privatization program consistent with international best practice, and (ii) a project targeted at
enhancing the competitiveness of Belarusian food producers by improving their food safety
practices.
146. The EU and the WBG teams would also associate technically under some on-going
EU and WBG assistance to Belarus. The EU has ongoing programs in Belarus that provide
policy advice on electricity sector reforms, energy efficiency norms and standards and promotion
of renewable energy. The WBG is providing TA in the promotion of renewable energy, wood
biomass in particular. Potential areas for collaboration between the EU and the WBG include
structural and institutional reforms in the energy sector aiming to support the Government in (i)
unbundling and liberalizing the utilities market, (ii) decreasing the energy intensity; (iii)
increasing the use of domestic and renewable energy resources; and (iv) energy tariff reforms.
Synergies will also be established in climate change mitigation area (e.g. forestry, waste
management) aligned with the EU regional strategy. A dialogue in the forestry sector will be
maintained though the second phase of the EU funded FLEG Program for which the Bank is an
implementing agency.
147. The WBG and the EBRD will continue a dialogue in such important policy areas as
investment climate and structural reforms (including privatization). The proposed WBG CPS
complements well the recently approved EBRD Strategy for Belarus and new synergies will be
sought in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and the municipal sector.
148. The WBG in partnership with SIDA and USAID is implementing Regulatory
Simplification and Investment Generation Advisory Project to help Belarus improve its business
and investment climate.
149. The WBG and UN have established synergies and coordinate their efforts consistent
with the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the Republic of Belarus for
34

2011-2015. The WBG and UN agencies maintain continuous dialogue in five strategic areas of
UNDAF: (i) sustainable social and economic development; (ii) national health care systems; (iii)
environmental sustainability; (iv) national migration management in line with international
standards; and (v) national governance system. Another important area of ongoing multi-year
cooperation is recovery and sustainable development of the Chernobyl-affected regions.
150. The WBG and NIB have discussed and agreed on approaches to rehabilitation of
wastewater management facilities under respective ongoing lending operations in Belarus.

V. MANAGING RISKS
151. A major risk is the reemergence of price and exchange rate instability. As discussed
in paragraphs 23-27, Belarus has only recently emerged from the severe balance-of-payment
crisis of 2011, when unsustainable policies pushed the economy into an inflation-depreciation
spiral. Since mid-2011 stabilization measures have been in place that have restored foreign
exchange markets and reduced inflation and current account deficit. However, premature policy
loosening in 2012 has led to the reemergence of price and exchange rate pressures, posing
renewed risk to an already-weak reserve position. These risks are exacerbated by Belarus’s
reliance on subsidized energy inputs from Russia, directed credit and sizeable foreign financing.
In particular, the Government’s over-optimistic growth forecasts for 2013 and potential use of
monetary, fiscal and quasi-fiscal stimulus to achieve it raises concerns over monetary and fiscal
prudence. In addition, Government commitments to increase major expenditure categories –
especially wages –could exacerbate the situation. These risks would be further magnified if
there was continued economic slow-down in Russia and/or the EU. Accordingly, the WBG will
carefully monitor emerging economic and fiscal developments. While the IMF will take the lead
on macroeconomic issues, the WBG’s dialogue on public expenditures and budget management
would be intensified and re-oriented should economic instability reemerge.
152. Despite the need for deep structural reforms to enhance Belarus’s medium-term
economic prospect, reforms to date have progressed slowly and may experience further
reversals during this CPS period. The risk of policy reversals remains high given the
centralized decision-making and control, lack of broad-based support for reforms and track
record of reform reversals in the past, including, for example, expansion of the list of socially
important goods subject to price controls in 2011 or shift back to ad hoc privatization in 2012. As
a mitigation measure, the CPS proposes to calibrate WBG assistance against the depth, breath
and speed of structural reforms. In case of constrained reform space in Belarus, the Bank
program will be limited to traditional uncontroversial investment projects for infrastructure
needs, especially those with global public good benefits, and AAA with stronger advocacy
element and IFC Advisory Services and investment in the private sector.
153. Another risk is that relations with the EU could deteriorate. Relations with the EU
have remained strained since 1996, with temporary rapprochement in 1999 and 2008. Any
further deterioration in relations could threaten trade and investments from OECD countries. If
the trade and investment environment deteriorates some of IFC activities, e.g. advisory programs
may become infeasible or dependent on availability of funding. The WBG will continuously
consult with key stakeholders so that WBG programs have support even in difficult environment.
154. Gas pricing is another area of significant risk. In 2010 deteriorating relations with
Russia led to the temporary removal of discounts on energy imports from Russia, sharply
increasing the current account deficit and contributing significantly to the 2011 foreign exchange
crisis. Over time, gas import prices should return permanently to market levels, affecting the
balance of payments and fiscal situation if remedial measures are not taken in advance. In
addition, the reliance on Russia as a key creditor in the 2011 crisis has further increased
35

economic dependence. Should the trade or financial situation again deteriorate, the CPS
program would be modified to refocus the economic dialogue and reassess which IFC financings
could still be productive. The WBG’s policy dialogue on increasing domestic prices, tariffs and
energy efficiency and ongoing investments in energy efficiency would help to mitigate the risk.

VI. ANNEXES
Annex 1: FY08-FY11 Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report
REPUBLIC OF BELARUS
World Bank Group FY08-FY11Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report
Date of CAS: November 7, 2007, Board Discussion
Date of CAS Progress Report: October 27, 2009
Period Covered In The CAS Completion Report: FY08 – FY11
CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) prepared by Gregory Jedrzejczak, Elena Klochan, Yulia Snizhko and
Oksana Nagayets under the guidance of Qimiao Fan, Country Director (ECCU2) and Rufat Alimardanov,
Country Manager (IFC). The CPS CR team included Marina Bakanova, Irina Oleinik, and the WBG
Belarus Country Team.

Executive Summary
1.
The World Bank Group (WBG), under the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY08-FY11,
supported the Government’s reform agenda through a program of selective investment and analytical and
advisory activities (AAA) with a strong focus on public goods and benefits to citizens. The WBG’s
strategy was adjusted mid-stream in light of the 2008 global financial crisis, economic liberalization
measures undertaken by the Government, and good WBG portfolio performance. As a result, the WBG,
along with the IMF and other partners, provided additional support to reinforce social protection, address
weaknesses in the market pricing mechanisms, and strengthen the budgetary process. IFC adjusted its
product mix in response to the crisis to better meet the needs of its private sector clients.
2.
The FY08-FY11CAS - both original and adjusted in CAS Progress Report - acknowledged that
macroeconomic and implementation risks would be high given the country’s economic vulnerabilities,
policy reversals, and inconsistent implementation of reforms in the past. However, the risks were worth to
be taken given the opening window of opportunity to engage Belarus in more substantial cooperation. The
policy reforms supported through the DPL laid the ground for future engagement in some areas. Through
its policy work, the Bank opened additional avenues for dialogue and produced and transmitted
knowledge useful for follow-up activities.
3.
Overall, program performance was moderately satisfactory, with a deepened dialogue and
tangible achievements towards the CAS goals, but insufficient progress on several development issues.
The WBG’s performance was moderately satisfactory, given the limited sustainability on the policy
front, offset, however, by responsiveness to changing external economic environment, solid performance
of the ongoing program of investment operations, high-quality and relevant AAA, and fruitful
cooperation with the majority of involved partners.
4.
Due to political developments in the country that strained relations between Belarus and key
shareholders, preparation of a new CPS was postponed for more than a year. This CAS CR - while
dealing with the CAS period of FY08-FY11 - also looks at the results achieved beyond this period
whenever it is substantially relevant to the CAS outcomes.

Progress Towards Country Development Goals
5.
Belarus has long been considered a country performing rather well on many measures, but well
below its potential: not using in full its well-educated population, broad industrial base, and geographic
location. For almost two decades the country has followed a state-led, highly centralized economic model
with a significant government share in all sectors of the economy and hands-on involvement of public
37

administration in managing enterprises and resource reallocation. Attempts at market reforms - most
recently in 2010 - were too inconsistent and hesitant to move away from a state-dominated model.
According to the EBRD Transition Report, Belarus consistently rates below comparators on the extent to
which it has transformed its economy to the new post-Soviet realities.
6.
The period of the CAS started with promising developments: the economy grew at 8.2 percent in
2007 and at 10 percent in 2008, mostly because of strong demand for Belarus’s traditional products,
cheap energy from Russia, and improvement of terms of trade.
7.
The global crisis was transmitted to Belarus in the fall of 2008 through lower export revenues and
reduced access to international borrowing. The impact, however, was milder in Belarus than in other
former Soviet Union countries in terms of output decline and unemployment growth 10. Economic growth
slowed to 0.2 percent in 2009 but quickly rebounded to 7.7 percent in 2010 and 5.3 percent in 2011.
Poverty rate fell by 0.7 percentage points to 5.4 percent in 2009 and further to 5.2 percent in 2010, before
increasing to 7.3 percent in 2011 as a result of currency and balance of payments crisis that resulted from
loose macroeconomic policies in pre-election 2010 and early 2011.
8.
The CAS was well aligned with the Government’s strategic goals articulated in the Program of
Social and Economic Development (PSED) for 2006-2010 11.
9.
Originally, the CAS strategic outcomes were grouped under two pillars: (1) Delivering Global
Goods and (2) Facing Transition and Shocks through Competitiveness and Inclusion. The first pillar was
aimed at improving energy efficiency, water supply quality, waste management, and infrastructure
services in Chernobyl-affected areas. The second pillar focused on increasing competitiveness and
diversification of the economy, and promoting effective and transparent government.
10.
In 2009, to mitigate the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, the Government
requested the WBG to broaden assistance in light of reform progress and the good track record
established in the implementation of WBG-supported activities. In response to the good progress
confirmed by the CAS PR, the WBG stepped up its engagement, opened a dialogue on structural reforms,
and increased lending twofold, including policy lending not envisaged in the original CAS. The structure
of the CAS was extended with a third pillar, Public Sector Efficiency and Fiscal Discipline. The
adjustment did not change the development objectives of the original CAS (to assist Belarus to address
global public goods in the areas of natural environment and energy challenges and enhance the
competitiveness of its economy to ensure rising incomes and to protect the welfare of the weakest). The
extended strategic goals focused foremost on strengthening public financial management system, with
particular emphasis on reform of targeted social assistance to reduce leakages and protect the most
vulnerable groups in view of expected severity of the crisis. With these adjustments, the CAS remained
consistent with Belarus’s evolving development strategy.
11.
Adjustments to the CAS were coordinated with other development partners, including the IMF,
EBRD, and UNDP. A Development Policy Loan (DPL) complemented the macroeconomic framework
supported by the IMF’s Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) initiated in January 2009. However, when the
IMF-supported macroeconomic program expired, lack of this anchor contributed to a progressive
unraveling of macroeconomic discipline that undermined and diminished the effectiveness of parallel
structural reforms.

Overview of Program Achievements
Delivering Global and Local Public Goods (Pillar I)
12.
This pillar supported investment projects with a focus on global public goods and improved
quality of public services not requiring significant policy reforms. It focused on energy efficiency, water
and waste management, and environment. At mid-term, this pillar has been expanded to include tariff
10

The Belarusian model allowed growth to continue but at the expense of increased inventories; registered
unemployment remained low, but there was an increase in shortened labor weeks and forced leaves.

of Belarus # 384, June 12, 2006.

38

reforms expected under the DPL. The program envisaged under this pillar has had mixed results: with
success in energy efficiency and environment protection, delays in the water supply and sanitation
program, and little progress in tariff policy reform.
13.
A more detailed description is presented below and in the self-assessment annex. The general
positive lesson is that strong demand at the beneficiaries’ level, strong ownership, and established
collaboration with the implementing agencies bring expected results. The two investment loans to enable
greater energy efficiency in public facilities including in Chernobyl-affected area were very timely and
met their goals. The negative lessons can be drawn from unrealistic expectations of substantially
improved and sustainable policies in socially sensitive areas at the time of Presidential elections and
worsening economic fundamentals. A reversal in the recovery of energy and utility tariffs is an example
of economically inconsistent mid-term policies not anchored in external obligations such as IMF SBA or
a DPL. On the Bank portfolio side, insufficient readiness for implementation of the water supply and
sanitation investment led to implementation delays while flaws in project design required project
restructuring.
Outcome 1: Provision of investments in energy efficiency measures to selected social and other public
sector facilities and households, including upgrading/replacement of heat generation and distribution
equipment, thermal insulation improvements.
14.
This outcome was achieved. The main vehicles for this outcome were Social Infrastructure
Retrofitting Project and Post Chernobyl Recovery Project, including additional financing. The IBRD’s
program was timely and coordinated with the Government’s program for improving energy efficiency,
which had started 15 years earlier. The program was in high demand at the beneficiaries’ level as it led to
social and health benefits in schools, kindergartens and other public utilities. IFC contributed to the
energy efficiency agenda by providing its first targeted loan, and accompanying advisory services, to
Minsk Transit Bank to support energy efficiency improvements by micro, small and medium enterprise
(MSME) borrowers.
Outcome 2: Improved cost recovery of energy and utility tariffs. Reduced cross-subsidization among all
consumer categories
15.
Outcome 2.1 was not achieved, though some progress in improved cost recovery for heating
should be noticed. While the need to improve cost recovery and limit cross-subsidization of tariffs was
well understood by Government officials, political economy considerations prevailed.
16.
Outcome 2.2 was achieved. The number of preferential consumers fell from 149 companies in
2008 to 130 in 2009 (by 13 percent) and 53 in 2011 (by 65 percent).
Outcome 3: Reduction of health risks for people living in Chernobyl-affected area due to exposure to
radioactively contaminated wood
17.
This outcome was achieved. Switching from burning contaminated wood to clean gas has had
multiple positive impacts on the health of users and environment. Successful implementation of the
investment was due to the Government’s and local authorities’ ownership on the one hand, and good
design and implementation readiness of the project on the other.
Outcome 4: Improved quality of water and wastewater management. Improved access of urban
population to a centralized water supply
18.
This outcome was not achieved. Implementation of the Water Supply and Sanitation Project underpinning this outcome - has been slower than planned, mostly due to insufficient project readiness for
implementation and weak implementation capacity of the new counterpart. Deficiencies in project design
(the fragmentation of resources across a too large number of beneficiaries) undermined the possibility to
achieve major impacts. In addition, the project was affected by the 2011 foreign exchange crisis, and
several BYR-denominated contracts without a price adjustment clause had to be cancelled and re-bid.

39

Entry, Regulatory Reform and Competitiveness (Pillar II)
19.
This pillar comprised the most socially and politically sensitive outcomes; particularly, with
Belarus’s strong focus on safeguarding access to basic goods and services and retaining jobs in the short
term. Both the IBRD via its DPL, and IFC via its direct investments in the private sector companies and
its advisory services, including the Investment Climate Advisory Project, continued to support these
efforts and provide technical advice on how to move forward. However, the changing macroeconomic
conditions played a critical role in the progress or lack of it.
Outcome 5: Reduction of regulatory and administrative barriers and decreased costs to business entry and
operation
20.
This outcome was achieved. There has been notable progress on this front, particularly regarding
small and medium-size enterprises. Belarus has made major advances in reducing its cost of doing
business. According to the Doing Business Report, Belarus jumped from the 115th position in 2008 to the
58th in 2010. This made Belarus one of the top ten reformers in 2009 and 2010, an achievement aided by
both the IBRD and IFC: the former through its DPL and AAA, and the latter through its advisory
services.
Outcome 6:Greater access to finance for private sector companies
21.
This outcome was achieved. IFC investments in Belarus grew rapidly during the FY08-FY11CAS
period, from less than USD 5 million in about two projects per year during the previous CAS period to a
record USD 125 million invested in FY11 in eight projects. Total investments in Belarus during the
FY08-FY11CAS period amounted to USD 335 million in 18 projects in financial, manufacturing,
agribusiness, and retail sectors. On-lending of IFC financing through private sector banks facilitated
almost 19,000 new loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Over 100 additional SMEs
were reached through IFC investments in agribusiness, expanding their market access. More than USD
180 million in trade finance lines to banks facilitated trade flows, especially in the aftermath of the 20082009 financial crisis. IFC investment portfolio in Belarus of USD 154 million is nearly fully disbursed
(86 percent) and is performing well, with no non-performing loans (NPLs) as of the end of
2012.Economy-wide, however, much still has to be done to create an even playing field for private
businesses when compared with state enterprises. However, the CAS design recognized the limited scope
for broad-based WBG impact in this area and set relatively modest goals which have been achieved.
Outcome 7:Support further tax simplification and reduction of tax burden on enterprise sector
22.
This outcome was achieved. Under the DPL and the follow up dialogue on structural and fiscal
reforms, Belarus achieved substantial progress in tax reforms. The most distortive taxes - turnover tax and
local tax on goods and services - were eliminated. Also, corporate income tax rate was reduced and
enterprises were allowed to use accelerated depreciation and carry forward mechanisms to add flexibility
to their corporate governance toolkit.12
Outcome 8: Support transition to free market pricing by further reduction of administrative price controls
and regulated trade margins
23.
This outcome was partially achieved. Belarus has had a higher level of price control than other
transition economies. From this vintage point, the CAS period brought quite important progress toward
market-based prices. This progress was confirmed by an improving EBRD index of price liberalization.
2011 saw some setbacks on price control, but it was relaxed in 2012 when market and social tensions
abated. The agenda of reducing administrative price control to the levels of modern market economies is
still far from being realized. The Customs Union with Russia and Kazakhstan, the accession of Russia to
the WTO, and intensified efforts to speed up Belarus’s WTO accession make the challenge even more
acute.

12

Doing Business Report for 2013 recognizes these efforts and contains a box on Belarus’ progress in the area of
paying taxes as the best practice.

40

Outcome 9:Quality, transparency, accountability, and efficiency of the privatization process improved
24.
This outcome was partially achieved. The IBRD-supported pilot project on privatization of
several medium-size enterprises is currently underway with an objective of introducing the best
international practices based on competitiveness and transparency of the process. The newly established
National Agency for Investments and Privatization is now fully operational. At the same time, the
privatization of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is still routinely done in relatively non-transparent
fashion, mostly driven by fiscal considerations. While corruption is relatively low, enterprises irrespective of their ownership - are mandated to retain jobs even if this is detrimental to their
competitiveness.
Outcome 10:Facilitate competitiveness of transport sector by supporting modernization and upgrading of
critical physical infrastructure in road and railway sectors
25.
This outcome was achieved. Road Upgrading and Modernization Project - underpinning this
outcome - became effective in 2010, and road upgrading works are progressing well. However, the
modernization component of the project has to be modified since the Government decided to implement
road tolling in Belarus on a faster track and outside the IBRD’s project. The lesson learnt is that
investment projects in Belarus are prone to broader risks - not so much for implementation efficiency
(which is generally good), but in the sense that important decisions may be taken at very high levels of
Government and outside the control of the WBG’s direct sector counterparts, without leaving space for
discussing the rationale of such decisions and their consequences for a project in particular, and for
reforms in general.

Public Sector Efficiency and Fiscal Discipline (Pillar III)
26.
This pillar was added in response to the financial crisis and was supported by a DPL. The DPL
was prepared with recognition of the urgency of the situation and with little previous experience in policy
lending dialogue with Belarusian counterparts. CAS outcomes reflect this urgency: from a well-defined
and structurally important outcome on safety nets to less elaborated outcomes on budgetary practices and
agricultural dialogue. In hindsight, additional outcomes of the reviewed CAS, reflected in the DPL, put
more pressure on reforms supportive to the efficient budgetary process and fiscal constraints at the
expense of social protection reforms. However, at the moment of adjustments to the CAS in the Progress
Report, the risk of grave social consequences of the crisis and an increase of poverty was real, but turned
to be overemphasized.
Outcome 11:Strengthen social safety nets by better targeting accuracy of the social assistance programs
for the poor and scaling-up of social assistance programs. Share of social assistance received by the
poorest 20 percent of population
27.
This outcome was achieved. Better targeting of social assistance expenditures had two objectives.
One was to recalibrate social assistance programs, away from universal benefits to targeted benefits,
converting these programs from entitlements to needs-based ones. The second was to make these
programs more flexible and responsive to economic vagaries, particularly in light of the 2008 global
financial crisis. The initial assessment was that the economic shock affecting Belarus would substantially
increase poverty. Hence, the DPL encouraged the Government to expand the existing targeted social
assistance programs with the budget for such programs doubled. Fortunately, poverty increase projections
did not materialize. Nevertheless, better targeting and accuracy of social assistance spending were
warranted - the goal of delivering 45 percent of these funds to the bottom 20 percent of the populations
was achieved.
Outcome12: Strengthening financial sector discipline
28.
This outcome was partially achieved. The IBRD support in this area has been limited to analytical
work, which helped to structure the IMF SBA program in 2009. The financial sector in Belarus is small
and - dominated by state-owned banks - inefficient. Continued lending with government guarantees and
subsidies creates consistent liquidity problems in major state-owned banks. Their recapitalization (5.3
percent of GDP in 2011) presents a large contingent liability for the Government. In the nascent privatelyowned segment of the banking sector, IFC has worked to promote best practices among its client banks
41

and, following the financial crisis, offered risk management advisory support to strengthen their
operations and manage the increase in NPLs.
Outcome 13:Budgetary practices in line with the best regional practices
29.
This outcome was partially achieved. The results of this outcome are mixed. Belarus scores above
regional averages on five of six PEFA dimensions. On the other hand, introduction of a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for policy-based budgeting has not been achieved yet. This was mostly
due to incompatibility of the MTEF three-year framework with the existing practice of five-year planning
cycle that is legally binding for the Government.
Outcome 14:Dialogue launched to increase efficiency in agricultural resource allocations
30.
This outcome was partially achieved. Agricultural and forest resources are the most important
natural assets Belarus has. Agricultural land is still owned by state farms and the system needs deep
reforms. While the Bank has prepared an Agricultural Productivity and Competitiveness Note, its impact
was negligible as the Ministry of Agriculture and Food - the main policy maker in this area - was not the
main counterpart for the Note, and the Ministry’s commitment to continuing a reform dialogue with the
IBRD was not strong. Expectations for this outcome should have been more realistic.
31.
In the forestry sector the IBRD continued substantial and successful dialogue via the EU-funded
regional Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) program, although it was not reflected in the
CAS outcomes.

The World Bank Group’s Performance
Design of the Strategy
32.
The original directions of the strategy were relevant to the challenges facing Belarus and aligned
with the Government’s core priorities at the moment of strategy formulation. The FY08-FY11 CAS was
more selective than past strategies, lowering expectations and narrowing its focus on what could be
achieved and, therefore, bringing risks to manageable levels. The FY08-FY11CAS was more realistic
than in the past. Having recognized that the political economy was not conducive for the Government to
take on “big ticket” comprehensive reforms, the CAS focused on investment lending leaving policy issues
to AAA. The revised CAS took a much higher deliberate risk by engaging in activities necessary to
mitigate the expected serious negative social consequences of the global crisis. Also, the WBG accepted
(though with some reservations) the declared Government commitments to more comprehensive reforms.
As a result, the WBG decided to use this “crisis opportunity” to deepen the dialogue despite the fact that it
was understood that policy results might be smaller than spelled out in the revised CAS and the DPL.
Policy engagement was important for strengthening the role of the Bank in Belarus over the whole period
of the CAS.
33.
The IFC program focused on the sectors that were open to private sector participation and had a
comparative advantage for Belarus, such as agribusiness and value-added manufacturing. IFC also
provided targeted financing through financial intermediaries to small and micro businesses. As expected
in the CAS PR, since FY10 the IFC’s investments averaged more than USD 80 million per year, with new
investment products introduced, such as energy efficiency lending, trade finance, and the first parallel
loan mobilized for an existing client in the manufacturing sector. Advisory work on the business
environment successfully continued during the CAS period, and several new advisory projects were
launched to help improve the competitiveness of private companies in the area of food safety standards,
sustainable finance, and, most recently, the efficiency of resource use. IFC repositioned itself in response
to the crisis to better address its clients’ needs through shorter term financing instruments, such as trade
finance and risk management advisory services.
34.
The ensuing results matrix closely corresponded to the strategic goals set out in the CAS. The
matrix suffered from a few shortcomings, however. The first was the lack of clear linkages between some
actions and the influence they had on advancing the Country Development Goals. In the area of private
sector development, the business enabling environment agenda for small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
was closely aligned with the Country Development Goals and produced measurable broad-based results,
42

which are summarized in the self-assessment table. In the area of direct support to the private sector,
through IFC’s investments or company-focused advisory work or through the IBRD’s pilot privatizations,
the WBG impact was limited to enterprises in question and to generating demonstration effects, providing
best practice examples, and modeling the desired behaviors. This was also the case in realizing
improvements in agriculture, where support by the IBRD was insufficient to have relevant material
influence, and water and sanitation with overly optimistic expectations about achieving results within a
short time period. The second was an uneven importance of the expected outcomes - from some related
to fundamental structural reforms to rather marginal ones which would rather qualify as intermediate
targets. The IBRD’s lending envelope was modest - about USD 100 million per year, typically one
investment operation, while AAA was expected to provide the intellectual basis to engage in policy and
technical assistance on the specific sectors’ issues. Originally, no development policy lending was
anticipated. This changed, however, in response to the 2008 global financial crisis and as an opportunity
to deepen the policy dialogue emerged, and was reflected in the CAS PR.

Implementation of the Strategy
35.
Hesitant reforms implemented by the Government led to repeated stops-and-starts in the Bank’s
program, including time gaps between subsequent strategies. The FY08-FY11 CAS was the first one
since FY02-FY04 CAS, and expired in mid-2011. This negatively reflected on building the investment
portfolio and related AAA activities in a more systemic way and in line with the long-term strategic
objectives. No new loan was approved between 2001 and 2006, and only preparation of an investment
operation designed to support recovery of Chernobyl-affected area of Belarus and AAA activities
advanced at the beginning of the FY08-FY11 CAS period. However, in response to market oriented
reforms and global financial crisis, 2009-2010 saw a significant increase in lending: about 60 percent of
lending Belarus received from the beginning of its IBRD membership was approved during these two
years. Significantly, the IBRD provided the first DPL, but reversal in reforms led to another slow-down
in lending in 2011-2012. In FY11 - under a revised lending program, the IBRD provided a new
investment loan to upgrade part of the international transport corridor, and an additional financing loan
for improving energy efficiency in Chernobyl-affected areas.
36.
Overall, the WBG managed its program well in a high-risk country environment with uncertain
structural reform implementation record. The IBRD has been responsive and provided timely and highquality strategic technical assistance and analytical support to the authorities; it created relationships with
other development partners, in particular, building strong complementarities with the IMF program.
37.
Together with the IMF’s support for macro-stabilization, the IBRD’s DPL helped to ease the
immediate pressures on the economy in the first half of 2009. The DPL allowed the dialogue to deepen on
structural reforms, but, unfortunately, the IBRD had limited leverage to influence significant change in
the structural reforms agenda, with mixed results achieved (from good progress in deregulation, reduction
of tax burden, moves towards market-based price-setting in goods and services, and social assistance
strengthening - to no progress in improving cost recovery of the energy sector and hardening of the
budget constraints for state-owned enterprises) and their medium-term effectiveness questionable.
38.
During the CAS period, the investment portfolio performed well. There were no at risk or actual
problem projects. All of the five ongoing operations were rated satisfactory for Development Objective
(DO) and Implementation Progress (IP). The entry of two new investment projects in 2009 and one in
2010 into a small portfolio resulted in a reduced disbursement ratio of 10.6 percent in FY10. The
disbursement ratio started picking up to 14 and 16 percent in FY11 and FY12, respectively. Despite some
improvements in 2011, a combination of inflation and significant BYR depreciation had an adverse
impact on contract performance under all projects (as price adjustment clause was not included in the
works contracts) and resulted in lower than anticipated disbursements across the portfolio. Additionally,
insufficient implementation readiness as well as limited capacity of the new implementing agencies
caused delays in two projects: Water Supply and Sanitation and Integrated Solid Waste Management.
39.
The AAA program was instrumental in building a dialogue with the Government in important
policy reform areas. Throughout the CAS period the WBG consistently provided independent and databased analysis, establishing a foundation of trust in the dialogue with the Government. In FY08-11, the
43

Bank delivered a series of Economic Policy Notes to update the 2005 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM).
Background materials and discussions for these notes informed the preparation of the DPL. A PEFA was
completed in FY09 and served to underpin the DPL through measures to streamline tax and control
systems and increase the transparency of state support. The FSAP Update and Auditing and Accounting
ROSC also contributed to the policy and reform dialogue. The FSAP update highlighted the adverse
impact of directed lending schemes on resource allocation, the health of the banking sector and the
structure of incentives in the economy. Its recommendations were reflected in the DPL, as well as in the
IMF’s SBA.
40.
The Country Economic Memorandum and Public Expenditure Review were the key ESW
products in FY11. Additionally, the Bank continued to be engaged in technical assistance (TA) to help
improve the targeting of social assistance programs and ensure pension system sustainability in Belarus,
as well as to continue the dialogue on structural reforms and strengthening public finance management.
Technical assistance to privatization was another key product in FY11. Building on the dialogue with the
Government started in 2009, the TA stepped up assistance to support the Belarus privatization program
through the grant provided by the Government of Austria.
41.
The sectoral AAA was strategically linked to lending and filling gaps in priority areas. The
Transport Sector Policy Note completed in FY11 served as an analytical underpinning for the preparation
of the lending operation. In the energy sector, the Bank supported the preparation of an ESMAP funded
study Harmonizing Renewable Energy Legal and Regulatory Framework with European Union. In the
agricultural sector, the IDF Grant for Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Monitoring and Evaluation
of Agricultural Policy Instruments followed the FY10 Agricultural Productivity and Competitiveness
Note. A dialogue in the forestry sector was maintained through the EU-funded regional FLEG program.
42.
IFC’s performance and program were moderately successful. IFC investments had strong results
as evidenced by the reach indicators cited earlier, although none of the IFC investments in Belarus have
been evaluated by IEG during the CAS period. IFC operations contributed to the relevant CAS outcomes
of improving business environment, strengthening the financial sector, including in the context of the
financial crisis, and supporting the nascent private sector. IFC expanded its investments, providing USD
335million to the private sector with a focus on priority areas in line with the country’s strategic
objectives. Accompanying advisory services focused on improving the business environment. IFC
rapidly adapted to the changing macroeconomic environment during the financial crisis, contributing to
the resumption of trade finance and funding for MSMEs, as well as improved risk management practices.
This helped IFC clients withstand the crisis and maintain relatively good portfolio quality. The Global
Trade Finance Program in Belarus reached its peak utilization of nearly USD 80 million during the 2011
crisis. Over 12,000 people, half of whom are women, are employed by IFC’s real sector clients,
contributing to the CAS PR objective of preserving and creating new sustainable jobs in the private
sector. IFC’s demonstration effect is typically difficult to measure, but the ability to bring a parallel lender
into a project or to attract a major international company to Belarus market are all examples of this
impact, and both took place during the CAS period with IFC support.

Risk Management
43.
Managing the risks of the CAS was a daunting task for many reasons. Firstly, Belarus’s social
and economic programs were often driven by political considerations, and policy decisions were taken
outside the public scrutiny with new priorities often difficult to predict. Secondly, the CAS period
covered quite dramatic turns in the economic global environment and in relations between Belarus and
the West. In this context, the Bank Group reacted well by building steady relations and knowledge
transfer in a number of Government agencies. It paid back, particularly with quick and workable response
of the post-crisis DPL.
44.
The CAS appropriately emphasized the risk of the political economy context (which in Belarus is
quite fundamental) and fragile sustainability of the reforms. Macroeconomic risks were appropriately
identified in the CAS to the extent possible in the very volatile global environment but, in retrospect, their
potential impacts were underestimated while the willingness of the Government to undertake decisive but
socially risky actions to improve the macroeconomic situation was overestimated, as acknowledged in the
44

CAS PR. Leveraging policy reforms through increased coordination with other development partners,
most notably the IMF and the EBRD, proved to be a right mitigation tool. A DPL that was prepared hand
in hand with the IMF SBA in early 2009 produced very positive initial results. However, when the IMFsupported macroeconomic program expired, the lack of leverage contributed to unraveling of
macroeconomic discipline that resulted in the second internally induced macroeconomic crisis at the end
of 2010 as well as undermined effectiveness of structural reforms.
45.
In the case of implementation risks, flaws in projects’ design and readiness, as well as
institutional weaknesses of implementing agencies, were not always identified properly in advance and
had to be remedied during implementation by restructuring projects and adjusting their implementation
schedules.
46.
With regard to IFC operations, the impact of the crises on IFC’s ability to provide new lending
was not fully anticipated. The provision of local currency finance was restricted when the National Bank
of the Republic of Belarus curbed the use of the swap facility. In the context of deteriorated political
environment and strained relations with the EU and the US, IFC temporarily limited its pre-privatization
activities in the country per guidance from its Senior Management and the Board and in line with the
position taken by the EBRD.

Lessons Learned and Suggestions for the New CPS
47.
This self-evaluation of the WBG's activities over the FY08-FY11 period generates lessons that
may be relevant for the next CPS as highlighted below.
48.
Managing risks in the next CPS. In the next CPS period, engagement of the WBG in Belarus is
likely to remain high-risk, given mixed track record in implementation of policy reforms and limited
leverage of the Bank in the country. While potential opportunities for engagement remain significant,
making continued engagement necessary, there are a few lessons to be heeded. Increased attention to a
medium-term macroeconomic framework would be critical to ensure sustainability of structural reforms
program supported by the WBG. Given capacity constraints in implementation of some reforms in the
past (for example, social assistance targeting), any future program should focus on critical priorities, but
be flexible enough to allow adjustments to the Government’s implementation pace. While a singletranche DPL was an appropriate instrument to direct and test the Government’s reform commitment
during the crisis, going forward (should the WBG decide to re-engage in development policy lending) it
would be advisable to consider programmatic engagement with a medium-term perspective. Finally, the
Bank should pay increased attention to cooperation with the key donor partners in the country,
coordinating their dialogues and policy frameworks.
49.
Synergies between Bank products. While the weight of policy reform is typically borne by
DPLs and investment operations help to implement these policies, going forward the IBRD should make
sure that its investment lending engagement is in the sectors where there is an adequate or improving
policy framework. The use of integrative approach - working closely across the sectors, combining
diagnostics with just-in-time advice and capacity building, and creating complementarities with the other
donors - proved to work particularly well in FY08-FY11 CAS, and should be built on in the next CPS.
50.
Learning and Knowledge Transfer. Since Belarus has its own reform modus operandi - more
gradual and top down than in other transition economies - it would be important to take into consideration
what has worked in other countries, and how those approaches might be adapted to Belarus. The WBG
should seek dialogue and cooperation with empowered policy makers and drafters of legislation, even if it
is more difficult at the beginning and will require more hands-on engagement of WBG staff. There is a
need for continuous interaction and learning between Belarusian policy makers and the WBG on core
strategic goals, as well as increasing awareness among the public. This approach has worked in a number
of sectors where local staff was ready to provide professional daily advice to counterparts. The IBRD’s
solid work in outlining the path to reforms in social protection and statistics is a good example of building
the knowledge base for investment operations and/or DPL, and leveraging the knowledge with partners to
influence broader sector outcomes. The challenge is to sustain and broaden such efforts.

45

51.
Trans-border Approach. Thanks to the geographical location and historical experience,
Belarus’s development is dependent on the cross-border cooperation more than that of its peers.
Transport, forestry and trade are the best examples where the WBG could use its regional expertise to the
benefit of the country.
52.
Institutional Capacity and GAC. In Belarus, the capacity of the Government agencies to
generate policies and implement WBG projects is very uneven. The WBG should realistically focus on
the sectors with stronger implementation capacity and a track record of successful cooperation in the past.
As a rule, PIUs are part of the government administration with all its limitations for hiring additional
professionals, such as lawyers or procurement and financial specialists. Loan-imbedded training
opportunities can provide good incentives for hiring professional staff.
53.
Program Flexibility and Sustainability. In Belarus’s highly centralized economic model with a
large role of the state sector and primacy of non-transparent politics, the WBG has to be ready to adjust
the program (both up and down) depending on readiness of reforms and willingness of the authorities to
implement them. With the exception of large unpredictable swings in the external economic situation that
may force emergency interventions (as with the DPL under the last CAS), the new CPS should clearly set
the menu of options and critical conditions for the WBG engagement. The CPS has to take into account
that reforms in Belarus are often quite shallow and reversible once the external pressures abate and/or
political calculations change. In doing so, it is important to seek long-term engagement, maintain program
continuity and not to be distracted by short-term changes in the authorizing environment.
54.
Expected outcomes. Expected CPS outcomes should better reflect the real impact of available
instruments. CPS outcomes should be modest and better focused on a few areas with realistic potential to
make a difference, rather than cover a wide “wish list” of reforms.
55.
Projects Design and Readiness. Despite relatively good performance of projects in the
portfolio, teams must be vigilant to avoid designs that are too complex, do not fully take into
consideration local capacity, are not ready for implementation at effectiveness, and are not flexible
enough to adjust to changing policy and macroeconomic environment without project restructuring.
56.
AAA. Comprehensive and deep analytical pieces were the platform for the policy dialogue and
have helped to build trust with key policy makers. Several key AAA (including the CEM and PER) were
built around continuous client engagement with many intermediate outputs being shared and discussed
intensively with the authorities. The analytical reports built solid underpinnings for future reforms and
contributed to better understanding by all stakeholders (domestic and foreign) of the reform agenda and
trade-offs faced by Belarus. Their preparation process was supported by seminars and study tours and
helped to involve counterparts with the decision making capacity. This approach should be continued in
the next CPS, perhaps with more continued, upfront assessment of impact of specific AAAs on
implementing the CPS strategic pillars.
57.
Staffing and budgetary resources. Last but not least, relative weakness of institutions, the need
for intensive transfer of knowledge, and the need for broad public advocacy of reforms would require
adequate attention of the WBG management, stronger local and international staffing, and adequate
budgeting. Mid-term CAS adjustment and the DPL stretched the capacity of the staff (local in particular)
to the limit and left some emerging opportunities for deepened cooperation unaddressed.

in the scope of investments.

SIRP and PCRP were essential components
of the
Government’s
larger
well
implemented energy efficiency program as
well as - in case of PRCP - aligned with the
government’s program to improve living
conditions in the Chernobyl affected area.
Strong Government ownership ensured
visible economic and social results of the
IBRD’s assistance.
SIRP included a tariff and subsidy study,
but project rightly did not require changes
in energy pricing and subsidies, given the
level of the IBRD's relationship with the
country at the time of project preparation.
A simple and well-focused design of SIRP
and PCRP, backed up by TA, contributed to
solid projects’ implementation.
One of SIRP lessons is the importance of
establishing baselines and targets already at
the preparation stage. For example, social
aspects of the project were not quantified in
advance and were difficult to monitor and
attribute to the project.
Procurement under SIRP and PCRP was
difficult as it included many sites widely
dispersed throughout the country and
contracts were too small for international
bidders. The lesson is that in order to
facilitate least-cost procurement and attract
international bidders, the procurement
approach needs to include: (i) the provision
of workshops and information to local

procurement procedures and determine the
reasons for their lack of interest or failure to
bid; and (ii) revision of conditions and
terms of the bidding documents to elicit a
sufficient number of bids.
The risks of changing macroeconomic
policies were underestimated. The efforts to
carry out some of the reforms the program
supported have been put in jeopardy by the
loose macroeconomic policies carried out
after March 2010 when the IMF Stand-by
Arrangement expired. The increases in
cross-subsidies in the energy sector also
undermined the achievement of the
program. As indicated in the DPL ICR, the
WBG - in the future - should make a more
forceful statement on the inconsistencies
between the unsustainable macroeconomic
policies and the structural reform agenda.
The main lesson is that if the Government
cannot ensure a suitable macroeconomic
framework in the medium term, the
medium-term effectiveness of a WBG
supported reform program can be weakened
or outcomes reversed. Prior actions are
unlikely to mitigate the risk to reform
program caused by the lack of financial
discipline and - as a result - the Bank has to
be more realistic in assessing limitations of
the political economy of expected
outcomes.

Progress under Bank-financed Water

main vehicle for this outcome - has
been slower than expected. Moreover,
CAS outcome and the original project

Once completed, the project will
increase access to water supply services

A Mid-Term Review identified insufficient
level of public awareness regarding the
gasification process and the selection of
households in some areas. This required
improved communication and outreach
efforts in project area.
The lesson learned is the importance of
having realistic, quantifiable outcome
indicators prior to implementation - the
project’s results framework failed to capture
outcomes supported by project activities.
Poor readiness was at the core of delays in
implementation of WSSP. By the
effectiveness date feasibility studies and
design documents had been prepared for
only half of 21 sub-projects. This
considerably slowed down implementation
and disbursement. Moreover, fragmentation
of investments supported by WSSP across
too many sites limited developmental
impact
and
contributed
to
slow
implementation pace.
Working with inexperienced agencies in
decentralized setting proved to be
particularly challenging. The lack of
capacity in a new implementing agency was
exacerbated by the need to work with
multiple foreign consultants and local site
owners.
WSSP focused entirely on priority physical
investments and did not address the issues
of sector efficiency and sustainability.
Going forward, systemic causes of sector
inefficiencies need to be addressed to
ensure services sustainability. The recently
launched Municipal Water Sector Review is

49

an important first step in engaging in
institutional and regulatory modernization
of water sector.
Weak implementation capacity (in analysis
of project design options, procurement and
contract management) for ISWMP at the
central and local levels led to significant
delays in project implementation.
Although newly appointed local authorities
developed ownership of the project after
intensive implementation support and
supervision
activities,
changes
of
counterparts caused delays since it required
additional time to familiarize them with the
project. Better coordination between central
and local authorities to facilitate decision
making will be crucial to improve
implementation.

authorities.

Outcome 5.1 has been achieved. Since
January 1, 2010, the maximum length
of an inspection for individual
entrepreneurs does not exceed 15 days.

Remaining numerous bottlenecks in further
regulatory simplifications will require an
overarching, endorsed at the highest
political level strategy for regulatory
reform. Otherwise it will become
increasingly
difficult
to
persuade
implementing agencies and ministries to
pursue further reform and simplification.

Outcome 5.2 has been achieved. Since
2011, the number of licenses declined
by about 60 percent, due to the removal
of licensing requirements for retail
trade and catering that accounted for a
significant share of licensing.

requirements was reduced, as were
simplified licensing procedures and
requirements. The time to get a license

In general, the Doing Business indicators

Government on several issues. However,
the use of Doing Business indicators as
performance benchmarks for senior officials
makes the temptation to game the indicators

comprehensive implementation reforms
instead.
Regulatory reforms are starting to be

One of success factors of the IBRD’s
support in this area was continuous
dissemination of AAA - from preliminary
findings and policy recommendations to the
presentation of the final report. This helped
to combine the advantages of analysis and
just-in-time advice, obtain early feedback
and increase the overall impact of AAA.

8.1. Share of regulated socially important
goods and services in CPI basket reduced
(percent):
Baseline: 10.4 (2008)
Target: less than 9.2 (2009)

Outcome 8.1 has been partially
achieved. Between 2008 and early
2011, the price liberalization was
implemented through (i) eliminating
the requirements for price registration
and removing administrative limits on
increases in prices, (ii) removal of retail
trade margins for domestic and
imported goods (excluding a limited
list of socially important goods and
goods subject to monopoly power), and
(iii) reducing the list of sociallyimportant goods and services subject to
administrative price controls.
The share of socially-important goods
and services in CPI basket was reduced
from 10.4 percent in 2008 to 9.2
percent in 2009 as the number of
socially important service categories
was reduced by half.
Belarus was upgraded in the EBRD
index of price liberalization in 2009
(for the first time since 2001) from 2.7
to 3.0 and further to 3.3 in 2010.

8.2. Launch dialogue to increase
efficiency in agriculture sector through
move towards market-based pricing and
reduction of state control over farm
management.

Price liberalization was partially
reversed in 2011 when some temporary
price
control
measures
were
(re)introduced in response to the
macroeconomic crisis. According to the
2012 IMF Article IV Staff Report, in
2011 the list of socially important
goods subject to price controls was
expanded to cover 25-30 percent of the
consumer price basket.
In 2012, the government started
developing a regulation that would
cancel previously introduced price
controls and bring its policy in this area
in proximity with much more

term effectiveness of the WBG supported
reform program is posed by changing
macroeconomic policies and lack of
coherent implementation of the structural
reform agenda.
Going forward, the WBG may consider a
more programmatic policy engagement with
a focus on a medium-term perspective. This
may help ensure the depth and continuity of
structural reform efforts and thus would
reduce the risk of serious policy reversals.
Heightened attention to a medium-term
macroeconomic framework would be
critical to ensure sustainability of any
structural reforms program supported by the
Bank.

So far the IDF for Monitoring and
Evaluation
of
Agricultural
Policy
Instruments (2011) has had marginal
support of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Food which is the main policy maker in
agricultural reforms area. The lesson is that
the limited impact was mostly due to the
selection of the research institute as a
counterpart rather than working directly
with the ministry.

Kazakhstan. Still, the share of the
goods and services controlled by the
Government remains significant.

Outcome 9: Quality, transparency,
accountability, and efficiency of the
privatization process improved.
9.1. Improved legislative framework for
privatization prepared: (i) establishing
clear procedures for privatization of stateowned enterprises; (ii) reducing list of
enterprises not subject to privatization.
9.2. New independent privatization
agency established and operational.

Outcome 9 has been partially
achieved.
Outcome 9.1 has been partially
achieved. In 2008 the golden share rule
was abolished, and the moratorium on
the sale of individual shares and the
requirement to sell shares to workers
was lifted. The list of SOEs eligible for
privatization and unitary enterprises
due for corporatization expanded
significantly. The earlier narrow lists of
SOEs to be privatized have been
replaced with narrow lists of SOEs not
to be privatized, making all other SOEs
potential privatization candidates. The
New Privatization Law was enacted in
2010. However, the biggest and most
expensive privatization cases have been
decided in a non-transparent manner,
outside the institutional privatization
system.
Efficiency of privatization process still
has to be improved, as fewer than
expected SOEs have been sold so far,
and transactions in a transparent bestpractice way are yet to be concluded.
Outcome 9.2 has been achieved. A new
National Agency for Investment and

Support to the privatization process is very
time consuming and requiring building trust
and multi-faceted cooperation with the
Government officials, privatization agency,
privatized enterprises (managers and
workers), consultants and investors. The
IBRD’s support has been successfully
focused on introducing the best practices in
privatization
of
the

enterprises. Neither the IBRD nor the IFC
have enough leverage to be a partner in
privatization of large strategic SOEs
without taking too much reputational risk.

of transport sector by supporting
modernization and upgrading of
critical physical infrastructure in road
and railway sectors
10.1. Assessment of needs and investment
priorities in transport sector completed.
10.2. Upgrading of Trans-European
corridor road started under the new Roads

under the MOE in 2010 and became
operational in 2011. The capacity of
NAIP to implement privatization has
yet to be demonstrated by bringing to
the point of sale the first eight
companies selected for privatization
under the WB supported privatization
program TA.
Outcome 10 has been achieved.
Outcome 10.1 has been achieved. The
Government has adopted the equivalent
of the Transport Sector Strategy and
Investment Program. The Bank
completed a Transport Sector Note
focused on transport sector efficiency.
The Government mobilized internal
and external financing for significant
road and rail investments. It supports a
balanced approach in transport sector
development, with investments in roads
and in railway modernization and
logistics.
Outcome 10.2 has been achieved. In
2010, the Road Upgrading and
Modernization
Project
(RUMP)
upgrading a strategic Trans-European
Transport Corridor IX connecting the
Black Sea with the Baltic countries,
was approved and has made very good
progress.
The Government decided to accelerate
the introduction of electronic road
tolling system, which originally
planned to be designed under the
RUMP and in February 2012 signed a
concession contract for the construction
and operation during 20 years of an
electronic state-of-the-art road tolling
system for trucks on the most important
roads of Belarus. The system should be

Project implementation showed that
decisions made at the ministerial level are
sometimes overturned or changed (at least
temporarily) at the level of highest political
authority. This may affect agreements
between the IBRD and counterparts, and
can affect project execution. Future
activities in the sector should try to address
this risk by leaving enough flexibility in the
projects to react to these changes whenever
possible without recourse to project
restructuring.
The open and competitive international
bidding process resulted in the recognition
in Belarus that their system of artificially
determining prices (based on the reference
price system inherited from the past) may
not give them good value for money. The
IBRD should bring this issue up with the
Ministry of Finance who might be more
interested in this subject than the Ministry
of Transport and Communications.
The local State-owned construction firms
should continue to stay eligible and be
exposed to foreign competition; this will
help them to become more competitive.

Pillar 3. Public Sector Efficiency and Fiscal Discipline
Outcome 11: Strengthen social safety
nets by better targeting accuracy of the
social assistance programs for the poor
and scaling-up of social assistance
programs.
11.1. Share of social assistance received
by the poorest 20% of population
(percent):
• Baseline: 40 (2008)
• Target: 45 (2011)
11.2. Income eligibility threshold for

• Target: no less than 6 (2009)

Outcome 11 has been achieved.
Starting from 2008, privileges based
programs were replaced with TSA and
child benefits with much higher
targeting efficiency. The Government
has scaled up and broadened these
programs in response to the crisis. To
provide adequate resources for the
expanded TSA, budget expenditures on
it doubled in 2009 compared to 2008.

With not sufficient institutional capacity to
carry out a broad reform program (e.g.,
social assistance) the IBRD should be ready
to provide proper and timely technical

Selection of sectors for PER should be
better consulted and upfront agreed with the
client. In this case, the sectors were selected
by the Bank team, as a priority from the
fiscal adjustment point of view (pensions
and SA). However, when PER was done,
the counterpart was not really ready to
move on these sectors and only now is
ready to move on SA reforms, though not
yet on pensions. (The two PER chapters on
pension and SA provided the evidence basis
and policy framework which will be used,
sooner or later, whenever these reforms will
be undertaken. So they are useful to the
Government anyway).

2009. However, with expiration of the
IMF SBA and suspension of the budget
support by the Bank, further results on
the ground have been uneven. While
direct lending has been curtailed via
tighter budgetary constraints as part of
fiscal policy, a new special financial
agency has not been established, as
planned. Accordingly, NPLs under
directed lending programs have not
been removed from the balance sheets
of major state banks. IFC successfully
provided advisory support to several
private sector banks, which are not
engaged in directed lending, on
improving risks management practices
and NPL resolution.
Outcome 13 has been partially
achieved.

Annex 3: Overview of Main Trust Funds in Belarus
1.
Trust Funds resources made notable contribution to the CAS FY08-11 outcomes as they
were closely integrated into the core program of the World Bank Group, linked to the analytical work and
responded to the country priorities, including strengthening institutional capacity and contributing to a
dialogue on tackling present macroeconomic vulnerabilities and advancing economic liberalization;
increasing efficiency of resource allocation, building statistical capacity, addressing energy efficiency
and renewable energy, hazardous waste management, and forestry and agriculture issues.
2.
The Trust Funds portfolio increased to 17 grants totaling USD 16 million in FY13, managed
by the Bank and IFC, up from 4 programs totaling USD 3.5 million in FY08 and 4 programs totaling
USD 2.2 million in FY10. Partnership with other donors resulted in leveraging funds for technical
assistance and advisory services but also for project preparation and co-financing, including financing
from United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Federal Ministry of Finance of Austria,
multilateral grant facilities, such as ESMAP, SAFE, and grants from TFSCB, IDF and GEF.
3.
Trust Fund to help Strengthen Financial Management Performance and Accountability (SAFE)
was part of on-going dialogue on PFM issues across the budget cycle with a particular focus on
improving medium-term fiscal planning and supporting introduction of output based financing
arrangements in education and health sectors.
4.
Privatization TA, financed by the Federal Ministry of Finance of Austria, is another key product
with the implementation period FY11-FY16. It is focused on providing advice on legal and institutional
instruments and implementation capacity building to successfully launch and roll out a privatization
program consistent with international best practice.
5.
IFC in partnership with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Ministry of Finance of Austria is
implementing Regulatory Simplification and Investment Generation Advisory Project in Belarus to help
the country improve its business and investment climate.
6.
Technical assistance, training, and key advisory services aimed at strengthening medium-term
fiscal planning processes were provided under a Strengthening Accountability and the Fiduciary
Environment (SAFE) grant. Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) supported an
introduction of a regular National Labor Force Survey—a priority area for the development of the
country’s statistics—providing relevant, precise, and complex statistical information on labor conditions,
economic activity, employment, and unemployment.
7.
Under a Biomass-Based District Heating Program (ESMAP), experts are looking at existing
legislation on renewable energy, barriers and options for increased use of biomass energy for heat
production, and energy efficiency, as well as opportunities to increase private sector participation in the
sector.
8.
Belarus is an active participant of the Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG), an EUfunded, six-country regional program coordinated by the World Bank. The program promotes sound and
sustainable forest management practices, including the reduction of illegal forestry activities.

Annex 4: Findings from IEG Evaluations, Client Surveys and Stakeholder
Consultations
Stakeholder Consultations
1.
CAS Completion Report discussions and CPS visioning meetings were held with small groups
of targeted counterparts with day-to-day experience of working with the World Bank Group. The
stakeholders shared their views regarding key priority areas for the next four years and the role of the
Bank in addressing them.
2.
The outcomes of the meetings were important for outlining the CPS concept and developing
a three pillar approach verified during subsequent consultations with representatives of the authorities,
business unions, academia, civil society organizations and the donor community in early 2013. A strategic
dialogue with the Intergovernmental CPS Working Group provided a platform for discussing the needs of
the country and the ways of addressing expectations in the framework of a future partnership.
3.
Consultations with wider groups of multi-stakeholders across regions included a series of
face-to-face meetings with central and local authorities, public professionals, parliamentarians, civil
society organizations, students and academia, private sector, development partners, and beneficiaries of
World Bank Group’ supported programs carried out in January-April 2013.The discussion focused on
opportunities in such areas as economic competitiveness, human development, improvement of
infrastructure services and global public goods, gender, approaches to supporting the governance and
social accountability agenda, the existing mechanisms and possible new frameworks for participation of
beneficiaries in World Bank Group supported programs. Discussions at regional level were centered on
regional development issues, results and effectiveness of programs supported by the Bank, and ways
beneficiaries could be informed about its programs and participate in monitoring service delivery.
4.
Overall, participants of the consultations agreed with the CPS approach and rationale and
outlined the following key areas of focus for the WBG partnership with Belarus: quality of life, municipal
sector services, education and employment, private sector’s role, efficiency of resource allocation, public
administration, climate change, renewable energy, and forestry and agriculture. They emphasized the
importance of taking into account the specifics of the country, providing technical assistance and advice,
and sharing regional and global expertise and knowledge.
5.
Many stakeholders stressed that the key issue for the Government was to improve the
competitiveness of the private sector and reduce the role of the state, and that the country
modernization agenda should be used in the dialogue on enhancing management efficiency, restructuring,
promotion of private sector development, and reducing the dominating role of the state. WTO accession
could become a driving force to liberalize the economy and develop private participation.
6.
It was noted that social agenda is an important element of economic transformation, and the
country needs international experience and best practices on social reforms, in particular on integration of
education and labor issues, restructuring of enterprises with due account of social aspects, ways to
improve labor force mobility inside the country, and developing incentives for families to increase birth
rate. It was recommended that the Bank pay closer attention to health, education and social protection
areas.
7.
The participants admitted successful earlier cooperation in the area of environment and
forestry development, and importance of regional cooperation, as one of the participants put it “forest
cannot be divided by borders” suggesting to strengthen cross-country exchanges and coordination.
8.
Representatives of the civil society proposed to include information and awareness raising
components in every project, more effectively use available mechanisms of public participation (e.g.
public hearings, as the legislation provides for participation in decision-making and consultations) and
develop instruments for beneficiaries’ engagement in monitoring and assessing the provision of services
in projects supported by the WBG, thus contributing to improving results and enhancing dialogue with
authorities and service providers on beneficiaries’ needs. Improving accountability in service delivery is

70

very important but it was admitted that there is neither experience nor technologies on how to introduce
them and involve local communities.
9.
CSO representatives requested the Bank to reinforce its role as a facilitator between CSOs
and authorities on development issues, directly engage with CSOs in implementation of programs
and projects and do it more systematically across the following areas (i) quality of life, (ii) environment;
(iii) renewable energy, and (iv) climate change, noting that energy efficiency is an example of positive
cross-sector cooperation.
10.
Topical webpages in Russian and English on the World Bank country internet site were
launched, containing information about results of the World Bank Group support to the country,
proposed priorities for the CPS to provide a channel to participate in discussion to parties not involved in
face-to-face consultations and ensure that information about the CPS reaches all interested.

Client Opinion Survey
11.
In January 2013, a client survey about stakeholders’ views of the World Bank and its work
in Belarus identified a significant role for the Bank in Belarus and suggested areas for improvement
in the mid-term. One hundred ninety stakeholders - drawn from a range of central and local state
institutions, implementing agencies, civil society, media, privates sector, academia, beneficiaries and
international agencies – were invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country. A
total of one hundred fifteen stakeholders participated in the country survey (61percent response rate).
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the central and local authorities; project management
units, overseeing implementation of projects supported by the Bank; local government officials; bilateral
and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private banks; CSOs; the media;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; and program beneficiaries. Respondents were asked about the
country development challenges and priorities, familiarity with the World Bank and their overall attitude
toward the institution, the Bank’s effectiveness and results in Belarus, the role the Bank should play in
Belarus’s development in the near future, and communication and information sharing. The main findings
are summarized in the text box below.

Independent Evaluation Group recommendations
12.
While reviewing the lessons of projects completed during the lifetime of FY08-FY11 CAS, the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) emphasized the importance for program success of ensuring the
Government’s commitment, selecting projects with visible economic and social benefits, and quantifying
outcome indicators at design stage. IEG also pointed out significance of associated technical assistance
and sufficient capacity development to carry out reform programs. Proper macroeconomic framework
was noted as critical for the medium-term effectiveness of the WBG supported reforms.

71

CLIENT OPINION SURVEY MAIN FINDINGS
Overall results suggest that private sector development and such areas as economic growth,
competitiveness and diversification, foreign direct investment, transformation of state-owned
enterprises, and energy are perceived to be the top development priorities for the country, and key
drivers to improving people’s lives in Belarus. Respondents see a critical role for the Bank in these top
priority areas related to private sector development and areas related to public sector reform, social
protection, and environmental sustainability in terms of Bank financial resources and knowledge
products. These choices are consistent with the priorities identified in this CPS and the findings of the
CAS Completions Report.
While two thirds of respondents believe that the Bank’s most effective instrument in helping to
promote development and reduce poverty in Belarus is investment lending, the survey findings suggest
that technical assistance, capacity development, and knowledge products are valued highly in the
country. Respondents are quite positive about the substance and technical quality of the Bank’s
knowledge work (research, data, conferences, etc.), including its accessibility, usefulness, relevance,
and adaptability to country’s specific development challenges and would like to see more attention
given to dissemination of the knowledge work and its contribution to good policy making.
The survey findings suggest that the Bank’s greatest strength as an effective development partner is
related to the way it collaborates with the Government. The Bank receives high ratings in areas such as
staff accessibility, following through over time, straightforwardness and honesty. The areas worth
further consideration are related to greater flexibility in terms of Bank’s products and services and
changing country circumstances.
With more than forty percent of stakeholders noting that the way the Bank can be of greater value in
Belarus is to reach out more to groups outside of government, and the survey findings strongly suggest
that the more stakeholders engage with the Bank, the more positive they are about most indicator
measurements in the survey, such as overall effectiveness, staff capability, collaboration, etc. This
analysis supports continued strategic efforts to engage with key stakeholders and beneficiaries of the
programs, to ensure productive collaboration and partnerships that lead to more effective development
results on the ground.
About ninety percent of respondents get most of information about economic and social development
issues in Belarus from Internet, however top three preferable ways of getting information from the
Bank also include seminars and direct contacts with Bank representatives, apart from online resources.
Only one percent of participants would like to receive information about the Bank from social media.

Cooperation at the national level between the state agencies
and CSOs varies from non-collaborative to systematic (e.g.
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental
Protection has a public advisory council providing a
discussion platform for CSOs and state agencies).
Local authorities are ready to cooperate with CSOs if they
see a practical implication/solution to local issues.

WBG should provide methodological and advisory support and sharing
best practices on employment with the focus on:
• employment policies in the context of enterprise restructuring and
labor shedding
• matching labor market needs and education sector
• facilitation of self-employment for those who have lost their jobs as a
result of restructuring
• ways to improve labor force mobility inside the country
Technical assistance and training for healthcare professionals on
improving health care system financing and overall support to health
financing reform was requested.
It is important to bring international experience to improve the quality of
education and the regulatory framework, develop per student financing
formula, and provide training to the financial staff and school principals in
using the formula.
The quality of public administration should be a priority focus for WBG
support.
CSOs should become implementation agencies for state programs and get
access to public funds.
Public councils should become a promising mechanism of collaboration
between the state and CSOs.
WBG should create mechanisms for CSOs involvement in WBGsupported projects. WBG should finance small local initiatives.
WBG should facilitate establishing channels of citizens’ feedback on
quality of services, bring experience and global best practices for
participatory monitoring and beneficiaries’ involvement.
Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and criteria should be developed
and introduced across the sectors.

Key Issues Raised

Suggestions/Recommendations

Gender discrimination is often hidden and difficult to
identify, measure and assess.

There is a need to develop gender disaggregated statistics
Gender wage gap should be assessed.

Issue of domestic violence has received proper attention
recently.

It is important to look carefully at life expectancy gap between men and
women and international experience of addressing it.

Different fields of education and occupation result at
difference in wages between men and woman.

The public at large should be better informed about gender issues.

The country has a strong legacy of traditional gender roles.
Road project supported by the Bank led to attraction of
other investors.
Price of houses along reconstructed roads (RUMP) has
increased; their residents could take part in economic and
financial activities.
Energy efficiency measures get attention in all the regions.
Belarus capacity in renewable energy is underestimated
(solar, hydro, biogas).

WBG could contribute to developing regional cooperation e.g. road
connections with Poland, Ukraine and other countries.

It was recommended to enhance energy efficiency policy implementation,
e.g. energy certification of buildings, involvement of citizens, awarenessraising among general public, etc.
WBG assistance in implementation of the new program of energy system
development till 2016, in particular energy savings in electricity
generation sector, was requested.

Environment

Forestry

It is important to ensure investments in:
• using biomass in district heating systems
• retrofitting energy efficiency infrastructure in social sector buildings
• expanding the use of renewable energy (biogas)
• building hydro power generation facilities
WBG could provide support to modernization of Hydromet to bring the
quality of the service to the EU standards.

Successful earlier cooperation - reconstruction of
enterprises to eliminate ozone depleting substances;
improved regulatory framework on environmental permits
and POPs, etc. - was noted.
IBRD supported Forestry project in 1990s and FLEG
helped to train high-level specialists; they remained in the
sector and held leading positions.

WBG investment to construction of forest roads, fire protection of forests,
development of forest seed centers and nurseries, and use of wood chips
for energy production was requested.

New technologies and innovations do not work without
training.

WBG could promote knowledge exchange with the European neighbors
on the up-to-date forest management practices.

Forest is a strategic natural resource. Belarus plans to
develop:
• environmental tourism
• wood chips
• fire protection
The country plans:
• double output of milk and develop new milk farms
• reduce energy consumption and costs in agriculture
• modernize farms and processing enterprises
• use alternative sources of energy

The WBG could support:
• modernization of food processing industry
• access of agricultural products to Customs Union markets and the EU
market
• establishing a unified center for food products quality control
• harmonizing the national standards with those of the EU

The country is facing acute problems in rural territories and
needs to develop their potential.
Business
environment/
private sector
development

The key issue is to improve the competitiveness of the private sector and
reduce the role of the state.

Directive #4 on liberalization of economy led to more
active dialogue of the state with the business, although its
norms are often neglected.

Private business needs access to financial resources and protection of
property rights.

There is reduction of tax burden on SMEs.

Modernization and attraction of investments could be achieved by
privatization but it requires political will.

Development of the service sector was noted.
The 2011 crises took significant assets from private
businesses. Wages growth with no growth of productivity
could lead to another crisis.
Wrong state policies to address inefficiencies (merging
inefficient and efficient companies, unwillingness to
privatize poorly managed facilities) raise serious concerns.

WBG should contribute to increase the role of the private sector and
continue dialogue on structural reforms taking into account experience of
other countries.
Professionals with technical skills to participate in competitive fields are
needed as well as experts to prepare companies to privatization.

Proposed amendments to the privatization law (state representatives in

Resolving issues at the community level (elderly people,
disabled) require systemic approach, the country’s social
services are not ready to respond to them.

Suggestions for the WBG support:
• development of financial market legislation, securities market,
insurance market; leasing and banking regulations
• deepening cooperation on financial literacy, including special courses
in primary school curriculum, textbooks and courses for unemployed
on financial literacy
• assistance on simplification of the tax procedures based on ICT
establishing tax consultancy and advisory service
WBG could expand cooperation on assessing living standard and poverty
level, labor force migration and introduction of national accounts

It is important to maintain the practice of joint events with CSO and
government representatives.
Regulation of humanitarian and technical assistance and CSO registration
should be simplified.
It is critical to involve local authorities as partners and the Bank should
work more with local authorities and arrange capacity building events for
local communities, including local administration.
It was recommended to include design of local development agenda as a
requirement for IBRD supported operations.
Hands-on training for CSOs on getting information on operations
supported by the WBG was requested.

Annex 5. Gender Assessment Summary
Belarus has invested significantly in the human capital of its population—both in men and women. This
continued and significant investment in health and education has helped to close gender gaps in key areas
of primary and secondary schooling and women’s access to maternal and child care. Also, as a result of
the socialist legacy, women’s participation in the labor market has been long standing. The legal
framework governing men and women’s employment is “gender blind”. In addition, the laws do
acknowledge women’s role in child bearing and there are sensible benefits related to parental leave (for
both women and men).
Gender disparities are best understood by analyzing men and women’s (human capital) endowments and
economic opportunities. The dialogue can also be broadened to discuss the institutional framework, social
norms and agency as factors which shape women’s and men’s ability to act independently. By covering
these three aspects, we are able to obtain a useful overview of the main gender gaps that remain in
Belarus. Yet all of this should be considered against the backdrop of a society facing a demographic
transition and a rapidly aging society. Belarus’s main challenges in gender equity remain in access to
economic opportunities and agency.
Endowments. Gender gaps in education are not large at the school level, but men begin to lag
behind at the tertiary level. There are no gender gaps in gross primary and secondary enrollment rates,
which are about 100 percent. Yet, women are more likely to continue on into higher education and a large
gender gap in favor of women exists (100 and 71 percent for women and men, respectively). However,
female students in particular are concentrated in tertiary subjects that are not well suited to the demands
of the labor market. Women are also less likely than men to receive vocational training, which
compounds the occupational segregation that is prevalent in Belarus’s labor market (NSC 2010).
Women’s health indicators are relatively strong for an upper middle income country, but men’s life
expectancy is low. There is a large gender gap of 12 years in life expectancy, which is 65 for men and 77
for women (WDI 2012). Unhealthy and risky behaviors among men lead to notably higher mortality rates
from cardiovascular diseases and injuries (WHO 2012). On the positive side, maternal and infant
mortality rates have improved in the past decade and are now comparable to those of developed countries
(WDI 2012). However, about 70 percent of women are ill during pregnancy (NSC 2011). This in addition
to the male mortality rates indicate that the Government may wish to focus on improving the quality of
existing health services and their accessibility.
Economic Opportunities. The gender gap in labor market participation in Belarus is relatively low
compared to other upper middle income countries, but this is driven by below average male
participation. In first quarter 2012, the female and male participation rates were 62 and 69 percent
respectively for persons between the ages of 15-64 years. The key issues facing women in the labor
market are occupational segregation and lower earnings. The raw monthly wage gap in Belarus was
estimated at 26.3 percent in 2011 and only a small share of this can be explained by observable
characteristics. Though it is difficult to identify the reasons for women’s lower earnings, possible causes
include the need for women to balance their domestic responsibilities with the demands of work.
Moreover, though child care is available, there are wide regional disparities in the availability of preschool education.
Women’s employment benefits have mixed impacts on their careers and long term welfare. In
Belarus, women are entitled to 126 days paid maternity leave—which is not overly generous. However,
employers are obliged to keep women’s jobs open (while on leave for family reasons) for up to three
years, and this may hurt their employment opportunities. Women also have a lower retirement age (55
years) compared to men (60 years). The earlier retirement age for women adversely affects career
progression and wages—and ultimately their pension income. This latter impact is especially detrimental
to women’s welfare since they have longer life expectancy and higher pension income would be
important for warding off poverty in old age.
Agency. Though women are earners and well-educated, they continue to face gender based
exploitation in some key areas. On the one hand, women in Belarus are in a stronger position than

77

women in the ECA region. For example, one out of four formal sector firms have a woman as a top
manager (BEEPS, 2009) compared to only 19 percent for the region. Also, women hold one third of the
seats in Parliament and are also well represented in mid-level positions in sub-national governments.
However, Belarus also faces problems with human trafficking. According to the United States
Department of State (2011), Belarus is a source, destination, and transit country for persons (especially,
women) subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Another problem women face is domestic violence,
though there is no robust data that quantifies the extent of the problem. However, opinion polls show that
there is a high societal tolerance for domestic violence. The legal support for victims may improve with
the adoption of the drafted Law on Prevention of Domestic Violence, which outlines specific rights for
victims to assistance, protection, and compensation (CEDAW 2011).
