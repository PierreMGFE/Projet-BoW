Executive Summary
1. The Mexico Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), covering FY14-19, is fully aligned with the goals of Mexico’s
National Development Plan (NDP) for 2013-18 and supports the Government of Mexico’s development agenda
of increased productivity and inclusive and sustainable
growth. The World Bank Group (WBG) program under the
CPS fosters the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and
promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The
Mexico CPS includes a benchmarking of extreme poverty
and shared prosperity and a thorough ex ante diagnosis of
development challenges conducted in 2012 utilizing a set
of country-specific Policy Notes. It includes a systematic
effort at selectivity for highest impact of WBG activities
on the twin goals, WBG comparative advantage, and
client demand. Finally, it presents a results-based WBG
thematic engagement program that integrates financial,
knowledge, and convening services in a tailored package
of development solutions.

its monetary dimension increased slightly from 19.4
to 20.0 percent during the same period. This indicates
that the recent reduction of extreme poverty in Mexico
has been the result of increased access to social goods
and services, particularly health care, but labor market
opportunities for earning a living are still limited. This is
due to long-term problems with productivity but also to a
series of shocks–the food price crisis, the global financial
crisis, and the A1H1-flu epidemic prevention. A rebound
of economic growth during 2010-12 boosted shared
prosperity as income growth of the bottom 40 percent
of the population increased on average by 2.3 percent,
higher than the average income growth of 0.6 percent for
the total population for the same period. These national
averages, however, hide important regional differences.
Poverty rates in Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca, among
the poorest states in Mexico, are 10 times higher than in
the richest states.

Diagnosis of Mexico’s Development Challenges

Selectivity Framework and Principles
of Country Engagement

2. Mexico is an upper middle-income country with one
of the highest per capita incomes among Latin American
countries. It is a member of the OECD and the G20. Mexico is an open economy with trade agreements with more
than 40 countries. It has maintained solid macroeconomic
stability in times of crisis and financial sector resilience.
Mexico’s innovations in social policy have been a matter
of global learning. Yet, despite Mexico’s significant economic and social improvements, stagnant productivity
and insufficient inclusiveness are the critical causes of
persistent poverty, inequality, and regional disparities
within Mexico.
3. Extreme poverty declined from over 11.3 percent
to 9.8 percent between 2010 and 2012 according to
Mexico’s multi-dimensional poverty measure. However,

4. The starting point of the WBG program proposed in
this CPS is a comprehensive diagnostic of development
challenges by WBG staff through a set of Policy Notes and
by the Government through its own NDP. Departing from
the NDP’s 37 strategic development areas, a systematic
filtering process then identifies 11 areas of engagement by
aligning them with the WBG’s twin goals, WBG comparative advantage in Mexico, and country demand. Within
these areas of engagement, WBG interventions can have
the greatest impact during the next 6 years on 12 specific
development outcomes. For each expected outcome of
the CPS, the country engagement proposes to deliver
tailored development solutions through packages of WBG
financial, knowledge, and convening services. Based on
the above process of selectivity assessment, the Bank

strategy: (i) exited several areas of previous CPS engagement (e.g., trade competitiveness, customs, judicial, and
influenza support programs); (ii) centered its ongoing and
new knowledge and convening program, including the
growing reimbursable advisory program, around seven selective multi-year/multi-sector Programmatic Approaches
for increased effectiveness and reduced transactions costs
(e.g., in innovation strategies for poor states; in integrating
social protection systems; in managing fiscal challenges;
and in disaster risk management and urbanization); and
(iii) limited its new financial services to the green and
inclusive growth and the social prosperity themes (e.g.,
Oaxaca water, community education, and second generation Oportunidades). Compared to the previous CPS, the
selectivity process resulted in a compression from 5 to 4
themes and in a reduction from 28 to 12 outcomes.

WBG Program and Development Solutions
5. To address the country’s main development challenges, the Mexico NDP focuses on: (a) achieving peace; (b)
making Mexico more inclusive; (c) improving the quality
of the education system; (d) promoting prosperity; and
(e) consolidating efforts to make Mexico a responsible
international player. The NDP also adopts three crosscutting strategies: democratize productivity, foster a modern
government, and integrate a gender perspective. The CPS
program supports these efforts through focused and selective interventions integrating the WBG goals of reducing
extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity with
Mexico’s NDP goals, with special attention to states with
the highest poverty rates.
6. This CPS proposes a WBG program focused on those
areas that are expected to have the greatest impact on
improvements in poverty and shared prosperity. Poverty
is measured by indicators of access to health, education,
nutrition, social security, housing, basic utilities as well
as by household income levels, the latter also being key
for gauging advances in shared prosperity. This means

COUNTRY
PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR
THE UNITED
MEXICAN
STATES

14

that policy interventions supported by the WBG ought to
affect productivity to influence earnings; inclusiveness to
make sure that the poor have access to health, education
and social security; and sustainability so that the expansion of urban development and basic utilities do not
deteriorate the resource base of the country. Given this
multi-dimensionality, and making use of a comprehensive country diagnostic prepared by World Bank staff in
2011-12, this strategy categorizes the main challenges to
reduce extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity
into four themes to: (a) increase productivity and ensure
its gains are widespread, (b) ensure that poorer segments
of society benefit from basic social services and contribute to economic growth, (c) strengthen public finances
and improve government efficiency, and (d) combine
the economic and environmental aspects of sustainable
development.

Risks and Mitigating Factors
7. Four potential risks to the CPS are: (a) sluggish
economic performance due to failure to increase competitiveness and enact key structural reforms, (b) little
room for countercyclical lending by IBRD in the event
of global or local shocks, (c) incomplete or deficient
program implementation due to complexities of the WBG
program at the national and subnational levels, and (d)
crime and violence. Three main approaches are identified to mitigate these risks. First, to address global or
local shocks, the WBG is undertaking a comprehensive
assessment of its financial instruments to provide viable
alternatives to the authorities. Second, in mitigating
program risks, the management of thematic business
plans and programmatic approaches around results will
help focus attention to strategic outcomes and portfolio
performance while maintaining the flexibility to adjust to
country circumstances and build in continuous learning.
Third, the WBG engagement is not concentrated in areas
of high criminality, reducing the chances of negative
impact to the program.

I. Country Diagnosis
1. The Mexico Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers FY14 to FY19 and is fully aligned with the goals of Mexico’s
National Development Plan (NDP) 2013-2018. The strategy also focuses on the World Bank Group (WBG) twin goals of
ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. This CPS document has five main parts.
Part I summarizes a country analysis based on a set of policy notes and also includes a poverty assessment to benchmark
poverty and shared prosperity trends at the global, national, and subnational levels. Part II summarizes the goals and
strategies underpinning Mexico’s NDP for 2013-18. Parts III and IV explain the principles and the content of the WBG
partnership with Mexico for FY14-19. Parts V and VI describe the financial, operational, and fiduciary underpinnings of the
activities postulated and the risks facing the strategy. Finally, the annexes provide the results framework, detailed country
diagnostic and poverty assessment, assessment of the previous CPS, gender dimensions, and an overview of the emerging
WBG engagement in the State of Oaxaca.

A. Poverty and Shared
Prosperity Trends
An Innovative Measure of Poverty
2. Mexico is the first country in Latin America
to adopt a Multi-dimensional Poverty Index as its
official poverty measure. Mexico’s official poverty
measure includes both monetary and non-monetary
indicators, with an indicator of monetary well-being
(measured by income below a nationally defined poverty
line) as one dimension, and access to social goods and
services as another dimension. To be considered poor
in Mexico, a person has income below the poverty line
and has at least one deprivation in terms of housing,
infrastructure, education, health, social security, or food
security. An extremely poor person has income below the
minimum well-being line and suffers from three or more
deprivations. Thus, income poverty alone does not make
one poor nor can income growth alone move one out of
poverty.1 These multiple dimensions underline important
differences between the poorest and richest states in
Mexico, highlighting the importance of reducing extreme
poverty as well as the shared prosperity agenda. This new
set of poverty indicators will also serve as initial indicative reference points to assess the impact of the policies
and programs proposed in this strategy.
3. Mexico’s extreme poverty line is higher than

the World Bank’s extreme poverty line marker of
US$1.25 per day. As of March 2012, the monthly food
poverty line, also called “minimum well-being” (bienestar
económico mínimo), was equivalent to approximately
US$4.0 per day in urban areas and US$2.9 per day in
rural areas at purchasing power parity. The implication is
that using the World Bank’s measure places 4.4 percent
of the population below the extreme poverty line, while
using Mexico’s monetary measure of extreme poverty
places approximately 20 percent of the population below
the official minimum well-being line. In contrast, in using
the Mexican official multi-dimensional measure, which
includes both monetary and non-monetary well-being, 9.8
percent of the population would be below the poverty line.

Profile and Trends
4. Monetary poverty rose between 2006 and 2012,
breaking a decade-long trend of poverty reduction
in Mexico. A long-term view using data spanning two
decades of monetary measures of poverty shows that
monetary poverty rates in 2012 are similar to the rates in
1992: the net reduction of moderate and extreme poverty
was only 0.8 and 1.7 percentage points, respectively, over
20 years (Figure 1).
5. Between 2006 and 2012 the extreme poverty
rate (food poverty or pobreza alimentaria) increased from 14.0 percent to 19.7 percent (affecting 23.1 million people). Extreme poverty increased

significantly during the period 2006-08 (when the affected population increased by 4.7 percentage points) and
stagnated in the years after, hovering around 19 percent.
Until 2006, Mexico kept pace with the region in poverty
reduction. Nevertheless, since 2008 the economy suffered
a series of shocks — food price crisis, global financial
crisis, the AH1N1-flu epidemic — that slowed economic
growth and reversed the reduction in monetary poverty.

6. The multi-dimensional measure, which allows
for a more nuanced and complex view of poverty,
shows a decline in extreme poverty.2 According to
this measure, extreme poverty declined from 11.3
percent to 9.8 percent between 2010 and 2012
(Figure 2). This measure not only gauges extreme and
moderate poverty but also calls attention to the vulnerable
population. Vulnerability of incomes (people with no lack
in basic needs but insufficient income) represented 6.2
percent of the population in 2012, a 0.3 percent increase
from 2010. Vulnerability by social needs (those with
earnings above the poverty line but without access to at
least one basic service) reached 28.6 percent, slightly
higher than the 28.1 percent in 2010. Only 19.8 percent of
Mexicans did not suffer either earnings or basic services
gaps in 2012 (Table 1). These numbers indicate very little
mobility (i.e., families exiting poverty or vulnerability and
entering the middle class). A recent World Bank study
finds that Mexico is one of the countries in the region with
less income mobility and whose low economic growth is
associated with little growth of the middle class.3
7. The decline in multi-dimensional poverty is due
to increasing access to almost all the social rights

included in the measure, particularly healthcare;
but the rise of its monetary component indicates
that labor market opportunities for earning a living
are still limited. The largest statistically significant
improvement was in access to health care, where 8.2
million more people gained access (Table 1). The only
social deprivation for which the share of the population
increased was access to social security. The increase in
the deprivation to social security arises mainly from the
lack of access among the population in the labor force.

Gender, Ethnicity, and Regional Disparities
8. Gender and ethnicity specific estimates indicate
important differences across groups. From 2010 to
2012, the extreme poverty rate of the Multi-dimensional
Poverty Index was equally reduced among men and females by 1.5 percentage points. However, in 2012, there
were 1.5 million fewer men than women living in moderate
poverty; but 300,000 more women than men live in extreme poverty. Poverty among the indigenous population
has fallen faster, but their poverty levels remain higher
than among non-indigenous population. Extreme poverty
among indigenous population decreased 7.2 percentage
points, lifting more than 800,000 people out of poverty.
Despite this progress, 8.2 million indigenous people
still live in poverty, of which 3.5 million are among the
extreme poor (Figure 3).
9. Eliminating extreme poverty is a critical challenge in Mexico’s poorer states. The national rate of
extreme poverty masks important regional differences.

Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca have extreme poverty
rates of 32.2, 31.7, and 23.2 percent, respectively. These
are more than 10 times higher than the poverty rates of
Nuevo Leon, Distrito Federal, and Baja California (2.4,
2.5, and 2.7, respectively). One out of 3 Mexicans in
poverty lives in Chiapas, Guerrero, or Oaxaca (Figure
4). Around 23.5 million Mexicans or 20 percent of Mexico’s population live below the official line of minimum
well-being of less than US$4.0 a day in urban areas and
US$2.9 in rural areas. This national average contrasts
with the high dispersion of poverty rates over the territory:
14 states out of the 32 have populations with monetary
extreme poverty rates above the 30 percent mark. This
indicates that Mexico has been able to increase the coverage of social goods and services like basic education and
health but labor market opportunities for earning a living
are still very limited.

Shared Prosperity Indicators
10. Regional disparities highlight the importance
of promoting shared prosperity in Mexico. For the
period 2010-12, Mexico’s income growth for the bottom
40 percent population had an average annual increase of
2.3 percent, higher than the income growth of 0.6 percent
for the total population (Figure 5). The increase did not
compensate the drop between 2008 and 2010 when income growth of the bottom 40 percent decreased slightly
more than the total population (2.4 percent compared to
2.9 percent). Looking at the entire period 2008-12, the
average income growth of the bottom 40 percent was
negative (but the decline was less pronounced than for
the overall population). These recent trends in shared
prosperity are accompanied by a reduction of income
inequality for the period 2010-2012.

decreased by 7.6 percent. However, this group was able
to fully recover the following period when its income
increased by 10.6 percent.

Global Comparisons
12. Using the international poverty line of
US$1.25 per day, only 4.4 percent of Mexico’s
population lived in extreme poverty in 2012.

Source: Author calculations data from MCS-ENIGH 2008-12.

The extreme poor account for 5.2 million Mexicans and
represent around 0.5 percent of the global population in
extreme poverty. Eradicating extreme poverty in Mexico
would have a small, though not unimportant, impact on
the WBG’s global target of reducing extreme poverty by
2030.
13. Despite its limited magnitude, extreme poverty, defined by US$1.25 per day, is a stark reality in
some Mexican states. Using the US$1.25 line (equivalent to around Mex$335 per month at 2012 nominal
prices), extreme poverty rates range from 15.2 and 11.9

of Shared Prosperity
14. Mexico has achieved remarkable economic
and social progress over the past two decades; yet
poverty reversed its downward trend, and inequality has leveled off at very high levels since 2006.
Therefore, in order to influence Mexico’s poverty and
inequality measures, policy interventions ought to affect
productivity to influence earnings; inclusiveness to make
sure that the poor have access to health, education and
social security; and sustainability so that expansion of urban development and basic utilities does not deteriorate
Mexico’s resource base. Making use of comprehensive
country analysis prepared by World Bank staff in 2012
(http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mexico/research/
all) this strategy categorizes four main challenges to
reduce extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity:
(a) increase productivity and ensure that gains are widespread; (b) ensure that poorer segments of society benefit
from basic social services and contribute to economic
growth; (c) strengthen public finances and government
efficiency; and (d) combine economic and environmental
aspects of sustainable development.4

15. Mexico’s solid macroeconomic management
stands out in a global environment of higher volatility and lower growth. Economic activity fully recovered
from the severe contraction experienced following the global
financial crisis and continued growth of exports, domestic
investment and consumption managed to close the output
gap by the end of 2012. A track-record of prudent monetary
and fiscal policies provided the framework, confidence and
buffers required for a rapid rebound of economic activity.
More recently, a global slowdown, aggravated by the impact
of fiscal consolidation and a slow start of public investment
led to a significant deceleration of economic growth in
Mexico widening the output gap again. This deceleration
bodes for a low GDP growth of around 1.5 percent in year
2013, with relatively stable exchange rates, inflation and
current account deficits (Table 2). Economic growth is

external demand and the implementation of monetary and
fiscal policies in support of economic activity.5
16. Despite excellent short-term macroeconomic
management during the 2009-10 global financial
crisis, slow long-run productivity growth and lack of
convergence remain serious problems. Mexico has enjoyed macroeconomic and financial stability, market-oriented economic policy reforms, openness to foreign trade and
investment, and a “demographic bonus” through a growing
working-age population. But it has not had sustained
high-growth rates, failing to close the gap with high-income
economies. Over the past decade, the economy grew at less
than 2 percent annually, well below the regional average of
4 percent. Its per capita income has remained at about 30
percent of that of the U.S. By comparison, East Asia Tigers’
per capita income tripled over the past three decades and
is currently about 60 percent of that of the U.S. (Figure 8).

17. Mexico’s trailing productivity growth partially
explains its slow income convergence. The country’s
growth has largely been driven by capital and labor accumulation and not by growth in productivity, measured by
either average output per worker or combined efficiency
of labor and capital. While physical capital accumulation
rates are within a reasonable range by international
standards, productivity growth is lacking. Productivity
collapsed during the 1980s and regained some ground
since the early-nineties, but slow productivity growth
and recurrent shocks—in 1995, 2001 and 2009—have
prevented productivity to recover to its former levels. The
economic literature offers many explanations for low productivity growth, all of which are relevant in the Mexican
context: inequality, underdeveloped financial system,
regulatory barriers for doing business, uncompetitive
markets for utilities, weak innovation and limited market
competition, labor market rigidities, and scarce skilled
labor.

18. High inequality and persistent poverty hamper
productivity and are in turn perpetuated by low
productivity. Inequity of opportunity in access to key economic and social services (such as education, credit, and
infrastructure) prevents a large segment of the population
from fully realizing their economic potential. This reduces
productivity, slows growth, and perpetuates existing poverty and income inequality. Breaking this vicious circle is
difficult and requires an integrated reform agenda focused
on mutually reinforcing economic and social objectives.
19. A comprehensive structural reform agenda is
needed to help boost productivity. Mexico’s financial
sector is small for the country’s stage of development,
impeding the channeling of financial savings into long-term
productive investments. Commercial bank credit to the private sector is well below the level in countries with similar
characteristics and below the regional average, and half the
population still does not use financial services. Concentrated markets, restrictive regulation, and anticompetitive behavior hamper firm productivity and economic growth, with
some estimation placing such costs at 1 percentage point
of GDP growth each year.6 Productivity is also constrained
by the low quality of education and inefficient matching
of workers and firms. The sector composition of jobs has
changed over the past decade, with a decline in the share of
employment in the tradable sectors and a rise in the services
sector, where informality and low productivity jobs concentrate.7 Mexico has achieved near universal primary school
completion and over the past decade the performance of
Mexican students on the PISA international learning test
(measuring largely cognitive skills) has improved, but it
still lags behind its Latin American and OECD peers.8
20. Faster productivity growth will also require
improvements in infrastructure, particularly in telecommunications and trade logistics. Mobile phone
penetration is one of the lowest in the Latin America, and
fast broadband is scarce and expensive. Mexico also needs
to increase digital literacy to close the digital divide. The
recent National Digital Plan has four axes for tackling
challenges in this area: e-government, innovation in ICT,
citizen participation, and open data. With regard to trade,
low investment in ports and logistics has resulted in a
diminished capacity to support trade. Mexico ranks 47th on
the overall Logistics Performance Index, with weak score
on customs, but also low score on infrastructure, logistics
competence, and international shipments. Logistics costs
as percentage of GDP are 14 percent in Mexico, while for
OECD economies this percentage is less than 10 percent.
21. In addition to addressing challenges for faster
productivity growth, reforms in social policy are
also needed for reducing poverty and inequality.
Despite recent progress, social protection faces important equity and efficiency challenges. Mexico’s social
protection system includes contributory social security
schemes, social assistance, and labor market programs.
But the system suffers from fragmentation, weak design,

and coverage gaps. Labor market programs overlap and
are duplicative. Three health insurance programs operate
in parallel with little coordination.9 The social protection
system lacks a range of mechanisms to mitigate the
impact of economic shocks; and those that do exist are
under-utilized by the poor. More coverage in services for
employability and intermediation, unemployment protection, and pension systems are also needed. Furthermore,
expenditure in some social programs such as contributory
pensions, agriculture development and gasoline subsidies
are markedly regressive. Finally, gender gaps in areas
ranging from economic opportunities, prevention of violence and equal treatment and rights, can still experience
much improvement (Box 1 and Annex 6).

••BOX 1. Gender Issues in Mexico
In the last decade, much progress has been
made toward greater gender equality in Mexico. Between 2005 and 2010 the average years of
schooling went up from 7.9 to 8.4 for women and
from 8.4 to 8.7 for men. The proportion of women
in the House of Deputies has increased from 17.4
percent in 2000 to 36.8 percent in the 2013. Equal
treatment and rights, non-violence, public expenditure, awareness of unpaid household work, and
political participation are issues incorporated into
the public agenda.
However, despite progress in promulgation of
laws and budget increases to enhance gender
equality, major issues still need to be addressed.
Maternal mortality is also a persistent public health
issue in Mexico with slow progress in alleviating the
problem (from 60 deaths per 100,000 live births in
2002 to 51 in 2010). Between 2006 and 2011 the
incidence of violence against women perpetrated in
their last relationship increased from 43.2 percent to
46.1 percent in spite of public actions to combat it.
This CPS will support the implementation of
the NDP agenda on gender equality. Given its
cross-cutting nature, the package of development
solutions on gender will bridge the different themes
of this CPS.10 Knowledge products will benchmark,
diagnose, and make policy recommendations for furthering gender equality related to productivity, social
protection, and environmental policy. Conferences,
seminars, and other dissemination and knowledge
exchange activities will follow. Financing activities
might also materialize provided there is client demand. Key initial efforts will be focused on assisting
federal, state, and municipal agencies responsible for
gender issues. Preliminary contacts are under way
with Chiapas to develop a package of development
solutions to accompany their state gender initiative.

22. Addressing the challenges of ending poverty and
promoting shared prosperity require a well-funded
and effective government. Mexico’s falling oil revenues and rising public spending needs require increased
tax revenue and more efficient and better targeted public
spending. An integral fiscal reform is needed that broadens the tax base, narrows special regimes or preferential
rates, and generates information flows that facilitate tax
compliance and boost tax revenue. On the expenditures
side, three main areas need special attention: (a) increasing transparency; operational efficiency and progressivity
of public expenditures; (b) improving public sector performance through better budget and financial management;
and (c) adopting a systemic coverage of pending risks
(e.g., natural disasters, commodity prices variation, and
subnational fiscal distress).11
23. Three challenges related to tax collection,
federal transfers, and risk vulnerability deserve
special attention. First, tax collection is insufficient. If federal and local taxes and social security are
included, Mexico has the lowest fiscal pressure among
OECD member states and is among the lowest compared to similar Latin American countries. Second,
dependence on federal transfers amounts to about 90
percent of subnational public revenue. This imbalance has lessened the states’ incentives to raise their
own revenue and has led some to financial distress
because of excessive, sometimes unregistered debt.
Third, budgetary disruptions due to growing global
risks are likely. Public finances are vulnerable to a
variety of shocks related to national and international
macroeconomic fluctuations, demographic contingencies, and natural disasters. Around 41 percent of
Mexico’s territory and 31 percent of its population are
exposed to hurricanes, storms, floods, earthquakes,
and volcanic eruptions. In economic terms, 70 percent
of GDP is considered to be at risk from two hazards or
more. The 2011 World Bank study, Social Dimensions
of Climate Change in Mexico, shows that 70 percent
of the poorest 125 municipalities are highly prone
to hydro-meteorological hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

24. Environmental policy must also be an integral
part of Mexico’s development agenda as a means to
support the well-being of current and future generations. Natural resource capital — forests, protected
areas, agricultural lands, energy, and minerals — is an
important contributor to Mexico’s wealth. Natural resources support economic activities representing at least 11
percent of Mexico’s GDP. They are an important source
of jobs and support the livelihoods of millions of people,
including rural populations. Environmental degradation
and depletion of natural resources in Mexico have an
economic cost equivalent to roughly 6.3 percent of GDP.
Environmental degradation includes air and water pollution, soil degradation, and solid wastes. In most cases,
these costs are primarily borne by vulnerable groups,

including young children, the elderly, and the rural poor.
As Mexico grows and industrializes, demands on common
property natural resources such as water and forests will
also continue to rise. Moreover, in terms of the environmental footprint of the urban economy, a number of policy
challenges still remain in the areas of land use planning,
waste collection, urban pollution, and energy efficiency.12
25. Mexico is highly vulnerable to climate change, which
is anticipated to exacerbate the country’s development
challenges. World Bank studies estimated that climate
change could slow down the pace of poverty reduction
by 2.4 percentage points by 2030, meaning an extra 2.9
million people would remain in poverty. The consequences of climate change will vary across social groups and
throughout the country’s territory, depending on factors
such as exposure to hazards and climatic variability,
sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Poor and indigenous
groups who depend on climate-sensitive sources of income could suffer the most significant impacts.
26. As one of the largest contributors of carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions in Latin America, Mexico has adopted
an ambitious plan to drive down greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions (Figure 9). Mexico ranks 12th in the world in
CO2 emissions (471.46 million tons). The climate change
agenda includes a partnership with the states as well as
the recently approved General Climate Change Bill (Ley
General de Cambio Climático), which calls for a 30 percent CO2 reduction by 2020 and a 50 percent reduction by
2050 (compared with 2000 level). Mexican cities, which
account for more than 84 percent of the country’s GDP,
generate 75 percent of the country’s GHG emissions.
Therefore, Mexico has made significant investments to
improve air quality in cities. Sulfur content in fuels has
been significantly reduced over the last decade while an
increasing number of cities and metropolitan areas have
adopted an air quality program (PROAIRE) with targeted
measures to arrest air pollution. In addition, improved
vehicle technologies have helped reduce emissions.
However, these trends have been offset by the staggering
increase of private vehicle ownership which rose by more
than 50 percent, from 13.4 million in 2004 to 21.6 million
in 2010.13
27. Energy subsidies arguably constitute the most
important market impediment for a transition to a
green-growth development pathway. Between 2005
and 2009, subsidies of electricity, diesel, gasoline, and
liquefied petroleum gas averaged Mex$200 billion per
year (around US$18 billion per year). Fuel subsidies
result in inefficient use of electricity and fuel and are
regressive: the richest 20 percent of Mexicans — who
own most of the cars and electrical equipment — receive
55 percent of the subsidy while the poorest 20 percent
receive only 3.4 percent. Removing energy subsidies
alone could increase GDP by 1.5 percent by 2030.14

monitoring progress on environmental issues needs
to be developed. Mexico’s leadership and early efforts
at developing green-focused GDP accounts are steps
in the right direction, but the remaining challenges are
to: (a) strengthen available measures for each sector
(physical and economic indicators of environmental
progress); (b) build on green-focused GDP accounts and
valuation of natural assets methodologies, particularly the
Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services
(WAVES), to guide macroeconomic and sector policies;
and (c) ensure public availability of information on indicators and trends so that constituencies can play a role in
demanding improvements in environmental management
and demanding accountability for governmental efforts to
address clearly defined environmental priorities.
29. Development Challenges and Framework
for WBG Engagement. Overcoming these complex

development challenges demands implementing a series
of parallel policies. Achieving the goals of reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity calls for
policies that simultaneously foster productivity growth,
social inclusiveness and fiscal/environmental sustainability. Some of these policies, such as structural reforms
in education, energy, telecommunications and public
finance, are already being put forward by the Government
of Mexico (see also Section II). This CPS defines, after
a careful selectivity process explained in section III, a
series of tailored engagements which allow for the WBG
to play an effective role in reducing extreme poverty and
promoting shared prosperity. These areas of engagement,
described in more detail in section IV, range from activities to strengthen social protection and financial inclusion
to activities enhancing public sector modernization,
competitive and innovative business environment, environmental protection, and upgrading infrastructure.

31. In its initial months, the new administration has
presented to Congress a series of reforms in telecommunications, education, financial services, public
finance and energy. All these reforms aim at addressing
several of the development challenges described in the
previous section. A telecommunications reform, approved
in March 2013, introduced a series of measures to increase
competition and access to information in the telecommunication markets. An education reform, approved in August
2013, aims at increasing the quality of public education
by improving the selection, training and evaluation of
teachers. A financial sector reform, approved in September
2013, includes a package of several laws aiming at consumer protection, access to financial services, development
banking, and protection to creditors and strengthening the
institutional framework of the stock exchange. The Government announced a fiscal reform package including reforms
in the tax and social security systems. The reform contains
a series of measures to increase revenues through more efficient and progressive taxation, as well as the introduction of
unemployment insurance and a means-tested pension. The
forthcoming reform in the energy sector, aims at increasing
investment in the oil sector. Finally, to prompt economic
growth, the fiscal reform also includes a provision for fiscal
deficits in years 2013 and 2014. These counter-cyclical
deficits, scheduled to taper off in subsequent years, together
with a large infrastructure program are expected to increase
productive investment and accelerate growth.

32. All these reforms are done within the framework of the comprehensive six-year National
Development Plan (NDP) 2013-18, launched in
May 2013. The NDP’s goals, objectives, strategies, and
action plans were defined through a broad consultation
process conducted in early 2013. The public and open
consultation process made use of various media and fora
and included events at the national and state levels with
focus on special groups such as youth, women, people
with disabilities, indigenous peoples, local legislators,
local mayors, and federal entities. For each goal, the plan
makes a self-diagnosis of the main challenges that impinge
on achievement and the strategies that the Government
intends to adopt. Specific targets and indicators provide
some elements for benchmarking the advances of the NDP.
33. The overarching vision of the NDP is helping
Mexico achieve its greatest potential by focusing
on five national pillars: (a) achieve peace; (b) make
Mexico more inclusive; (c) improve the quality of
the education system; (d) promote prosperity; and
(e) consolidate Mexico as a responsible international player. The NDP also adopts three cross-cutting
strategies: democratize productivity to integrate Mexicans
into the formal economy; close and modern government
by simplifying procedures and regulations; and a gender
perspective to ensure the rights of women and prevent
gender differences from becoming a source of inequality.
34. Mexico in Peace. Mexico in peace aims at improving areas ranging from public security and governance to
the judicial system, national defense, and human rights.
The NDP identifies criminal activity linked to drug
trafficking as a serious challenge to development, albeit
this problem is not generalized at the country level but
focused in a few regions. A more widespread problem
is violence in the family, particularly against women,
as well as a generalized public perception of slow and
sometimes corrupt judicial and police institutions. The

NDP identifies several key interventions for the peace
objective. These interventions include creation of better
education and employment opportunities for the youth;
policies to prevent violence against women, boys and
girls; and policies boosting confidence in the judicial and
police institutions through promotion of the new justice
system that would deliver more humane, agile, efficient,
and accessible justice to all people.
35. Inclusive Mexico. There are growing public health
problems, such as obesity and hypertension, and there is
a growing number of youth who neither study nor work.
The Mexican social security system will face mounting
financial pressures to tackle these problems. Inclusive
Mexico focuses on Government actions to guarantee
social rights and close inequality gaps that divide the
country. It includes initiatives to: (a) guarantee social
rights to its population; (b) strengthen social participation
in community development, and protect the rights and
inclusion of people with disabilities; (c) secure the right to
national social services particularly to vulnerable populations; (d) increase access to social security by promoting a
sustainable system of universal coverage; and (e) promote
a sustainable urban development model and promote
regional development and housing markets.
36. Mexico with Quality Education. The NDP
recognizes universal coverage in basic education, but a
lag in quality hinders advances in secondary education.
Moreover, there is need for a closer connection between
the skills that the education system provides and the
demands from society. This is even more acute in the
case of science and technology and its relation to innovation and business creation. The NDP indicates that
these challenges require decisive public investments in
infrastructure for schools, universities, cultural centers,
and sports facilities. Quality teachers and instructors
are an essential complement to these investments. The
NDP seeks to build human potential for innovation with

quality education based on initiatives to: (a) strengthen
teacher professionalization, modernize infrastructure, and
promote ICT in the teaching process; (b) guarantee an
inclusive education system; (c) increase access to culture
and sports as a means of integral citizen development;
and (d) promote ICT and innovation.
37. Prosperous Mexico. While highlighting the effective macroeconomic management that has distinguished
Mexico in recent years, the NDP also highlights the need
for improving the performance of sectors such as finance,
mining, agriculture, telecommunications, and energy. The
expansion and modernization of these sectors are a necessary condition for promoting employment creation and regional development. Prosperous Mexico seeks to increase
prosperity and growth prospects by improving productivity.
Its specific actions seek to: (a) maintain macroeconomic
stability, including managing external risks; (b) promote
access to finance; (c) promote quality employment; (d)
promote inclusive green growth that generates income,
competition, and employment; (e) promote affordable access to energy and telecommunication services; (f) provide
incentives for the development of a competitive internal
market; (g) promote and strengthen entrepreneurship and
small and medium-size businesses; and (h) promote investments and competitiveness of the mining, infrastructure,
transport, agriculture and tourism sectors.
38. Mexico as an International Responsible Actor.
Mexico can increase its development potential and competitiveness by promoting an active and effective foreign
policy. The NDP highlights three main areas of interest:
(a) fostering global governance; (b) promoting foreign
trade and investment; and (c) protecting international
migrations. The NDP indicates the use of international
agreements and institutional development as the main
instrument for addressing these areas. Mexico played a
strong global role chairing the G20 and is pledging resources to the UN system and IDA replenishment.

III. WBG Partnership:
Selectivity Filtering
Process and Country
Engagement Model
39. The proposed WBG development solutions engagement with Mexico is based on a systematic filtering
process to define priority action areas and consolidates
past efforts toward a more strategic and integrated client
engagement. The engagement model seeks to maximize
the impact of a tailored package of WBG financial,
knowledge, and convening services for promoting shared
prosperity and reducing extreme poverty in a sustainable
manner. The CPS builds on lessons learned in organizing
development solutions around themes and flexible packages of services. It draws on the scope of collaboration
among WBG organizations for each of these areas, based
on each organization’s comparative advantage and client
demand. Finally, the country engagement integrates the
effort to share globally Mexico’s best practice experiences
in several of these areas, such as conditional cash transfers and energy efficiency programs.

the CPS was able to improve alignment, operational
efficiency, and impact through the use of more focused
interventions and programmatic knowledge approaches,
greater wholesaling resource and budget mobilization,
real-time learning and adaptation, and exit of program
areas where value added, comparative advantage, and
impact was no longer aligned with the evolving program
nor achievable.

A. Lessons Learned
from Previous CPS

43. Continue to support Mexico’s role as a global
knowledge leader. As an innovative middle-income
country, Mexico engaged in 33 knowledge exchanges
during the past CPS and has become widely recognized
as a key global actor in climate change policy. The WBG
should continue supporting the Government in exchanging knowledge with other countries. There is a strong
potential for global knowledge brokering with the Bank as
the global connector.

40. The Mexico FY08-13 CPS Completion Report
(Annex 2) highlights six lessons that are relevant
for the design of the new strategy.

41. Operational flexibility in packaging services.
The FY08-13 CPS was designed to be flexible and innovative in responding to Mexico’s financial and development needs. This flexibility allowed the Bank to respond
expeditiously to the Government’s requests when the
global economic downturn hit the country. The implementation of Mexico’s past country strategies reflect
the initial transition to a more strategic and integrated
client engagement that seeks to maximize the package
of services offered by the WBG in multi-sector approaches. By retaining flexibility in its implementation,

42. Working with subnational clients. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the State of Oaxaca
proved to be a successful strategy to support the poorest
states of Mexico. The MoU is serving to deepen dialogue,
monitor implementation, and assess impact within the
framework of a multi-year programmatic engagement.
Hence, the Bank should continue to support poor states in
Mexico following the experience with the State of Oaxaca
(Annex 7).

44. World Bank, IFC, and MIGA cooperation.
Bank–IFC cooperation on specific areas around their
core competencies should improve effectiveness to
achieving common goals in areas such as improving
competitiveness and business climate, access to financial
markets, and infrastructure development activities.
MIGA engagement with Mexico is emerging, and Bank
and IFC would work closely to support MIGA’s successful
in-country transition.

45. Lending instruments. During crisis periods, the
use of the Additional Financing instrument led to simpler,
faster, and more cost-effective results for the borrower,
compared to other lending instruments. Development
Policy Loans (DPL) were effective in sustaining progress
and protecting long-term reforms in the face of negative
external shocks. Multi-sectorwide approach (SWAP-type)
operations (such as in infrastructure) may not be practical
in the Mexico context since they require significant effort
to design and supervise and may dilute the Bank’s ability
to provide just-in-time policy advice and technical assistance. Governance and anti-corruption measures may
limit the flexibility of quickly preparing and disbursing
emergency operations (such as in the support to influenza)
in countries with strong legal frameworks and adequate
control environments.
46. Knowledge services. Trust fund resources were
indispensable in providing demand-driven technical
know-how and in strengthening coordination among key
stakeholders and financed studies of often overlooked
aspects, especially in environmental and social areas.
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) are powerful
instruments when processed quickly by the Bank and
client. Having a framework agreement signed by the
Government and the Bank would certainly facilitate
their processing by avoiding the time-consuming task of
negotiating sensitive clauses with each client within the
government separately. Programmatic approaches showed
to be remarkable instruments in focusing and prioritizing
Bank interventions. Dissemination is required to share
the findings of Bank studies at the local level.

B. Consultations on FY14-19 CPS
47. The CPS FY14-19 was developed in close consultation with the Government, private sector, academia,
and civil society, comprising over 80 interlocutors. The
meetings took place in September 2013 in Mexico City
with participants representing stakeholders from several
government ministries and agencies at various levels,
trade unions, political parties, entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations, and chambers of commerce
at both the national and state levels. Consultations for
the CPS were carried out while the new authorities
were developing specific sector implementation plans
and strategies that complement the NDP 2013-18. This
allowed the WBG to align its interventions with those of
the authorities, ensuring that the development solutions
proposed would have the greatest impact. Moreover,
the CPS consultation process was driven by the need to
work as One World Bank Group bringing together the
IFC, IBRD and MIGA teams to harness expertise across
the institution, and leverage public and private efforts
when communicating with a wide range of groups. The
consultations suggest that most stakeholders value the
WBG support. The Federal Government acknowledged
the Bank’s partnership and flexibility in focusing at the

subnational level (e.g., Oaxaca MoU) and confirmed its
request to expand the subnational engagement to the
States of Guerrero and Chiapas. The Government also
highlighted the value of the CPS systematic effort at
selectivity for highest impact of WBG activities on ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity in Mexico.
Government officials described the WBG involvement
as central in supporting the National Development Plan.
Ministries and agencies also noted that the CPS is in
close accord to and complements their own multi-annual
programs.

C. Approach to Dynamic Selectivity
48. A systematic filtering process provides selectivity and improves alignment, efficiency, and
impact. Three filters were used in selecting areas of
engagement: (a) WBG comparative advantage; (b) level
of client demand; and (c) alignment with WBG twin goals
benchmarked by Mexico’s new Multi-dimensional Poverty Index. Starting from the Government’s 37 pillar-based
activities of the National Development Plan, a systematic
filtering process led to identifying four thematic areas for
WBG intervention (Figure 10). Within these 4 themes, the
WBG team focused on 11 specific areas of engagement
(Table 3) and further identified 23 specific problem
areas (Annex 1) on which the WBG is expected to have
the greatest development impact. Following this logical
chain, the CPS then describes the specific development
solutions proposed (Annex 1). These consist of a tailored
package of WBG financial, knowledge, and convening
services for each of these problem areas, leading to 12
specific CPS expected outcomes.
49. Targeted interventions on poorest States and
frontier markets. Central to this engagement is working
with both public and private sector clients in longer-term

and multi-sector approaches at the federal level and with
the poorest states (Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Guerrero) along
the lines of the multi-sector WBG experience with the
on-going State of Oaxaca program (Annex 7). Specific
requests from other states will be assessed based on their
impact on the key development challenges identified
for the country, and significant parts of the knowledge
activities provided to these states are likely to be financed
though Reimbursable Advisory Services. IFC has a priority focus on frontier markers where there is significant
poverty and perceived riskiness deters the private sector
from investing to support inclusive growth.
50. The selectivity approach helped in refocusing
the country strategy and in identifying areas of
engagement where the WB will be exiting as compared to the previous CPS:
•A
 reas where the Bank is exiting, compared to
the previous CPS, related to weak client demand and unsuccessful engagements in trade
competitiveness, customs, judicial, and influenza support programs, leading to a reduced
number of themes, outcomes and activities.
The number of themes compressed from 5 to 4
and the number of outcomes declined from 28
to 12 compared to the previous CPS.
• Increased selectivity of ongoing activities.
More than half of the financial and knowledge
services currently under implementation will
close within two years (17 of the 25 ongoing
projects and 12 of the ongoing 29 knowledge
services will close in FY14 or FY15.). This
CPS shifts the full knowledge and convening
program to multi-year/multi-sector Programmatic Approaches with one common
development objective aligned to CPS themes
(e.g., in innovation strategies for poor states;

PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR
THE UNITED
MEXICAN
STATES

28

in integrating social protection systems; in
managing fiscal challenges; and in disaster risk
management and urbanization). This approach
would increase development effectiveness and
reduce transaction cost.
• New engagement is selective. A limited number
of new financial services (loans, GEF, CTF) are
currently foreseen for this CPS, concentrated
in the green and inclusive growth, and the
social prosperity themes (e.g., Oaxaca water,
community education, and second generation
Oportunidades). Only seven selective, high-impact Programmatic Approaches in support of
CPS themes are currently in the pipeline. This
is further supported by an increasing demand
in Reimbursable Advisory Services, further
strengthening the cost-benefit ratio of the
knowledge portfolio.
51. Progress in achieving the goals of the strategy
will be assessed with two progress reports and
one completion report at the end of the CPS
period. The results framework presented in Annex 1A
sets out specific outcome indicators with baselines and
targets covering the period of the CPS for each of the
identified outcomes. A logical chain has been established
from country-level goals, diagnostic of development
challenges, WBG comparative advantage, and selective
engagement relative to the WBG goals; and with clearly
defined outcomes, indicators, and targets. Constant client
dialogue, two Progress Reports and an annual Country
Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPR) covering the full
package of services will allow for flexible adjustments of
the strategy and results framework. Mexico has one of
the best national monitoring, evaluation, and statistical
systems among WBG client countries and is a knowledge
leader in this area. Data availability and collection does
not pose a risk to strategy monitoring.

Strategy: Areas of
Engagement
52. This CPS FY14-19 shifts to a country engagement
model based on a development solutions approach by
delivering a customized package of WBG financial,
knowledge and convening activities. This engagement
model also packages all knowledge and convening
activities into multi-year programmatic engagements.
This aggregation of tasks with diverse sources of
funding, including trust funds and RAS, emphasizes
the synergies and linkages between the various WBG
activities related to the solution of a specific development problem.

market development are sound ways to broaden access
and deepen the financial system. However, experience in
several countries has shown that accelerated (or forced)
expansion of credit can harm rather than benefit customers. If financial institutions do not follow sound practices,
they can fail, harming borrowers and depositors alike and
creating social unrest, with substantial fiscal cost. An
oversight system (both micro- and macro-prudential) that
encourages prudent risk-taking and facilitates prompt
resolution of failed institutions ensures that strategies
for financial deepening do not compromise financial
stability.

Theme 1. Unleashing Productivity

55. The WBG will continue supporting reforms
to foster sound financial sector development,
including the recently draft financial reform
initiative. The World Bank will provide support for the
implementation of the financial reform initiative through
a programmatic knowledge engagement. The package
envisions the reform of 34 laws and numerous secondary
regulations in the areas of capital markets, public banks,
financial infrastructure, and financial oversight. The
Bank will also work with telecommunications industry
to evaluate a pilot to bring the use of mobile phone operated electronic wallets to isolated rural communities,
which currently lack wireless phone access. Scale-up
of the pilot is contingent on the evaluation results. IFC
plans to increase its investment portfolio for financial
institutions focused on MSME lending, niche banks and
further penetrating non-bank financial markets (pension
funds, insurance, capital markets). IFC is also seeking
to support financial infrastructure through alternative
channels such as mobile banking, and will continue to
assist in the development of the capital markets enabling
companies to access the local debt market. MIGA can
provide guarantees to increase cross-border lending to
local clients, including MSMEs.

53. To increase productivity and ensure that such
gains are widespread, focus should be placed on policies and programs that primarily benefit SMEs, foster
new enterprise creation and innovation, and upgrade
infrastructure. To these ends it is essential to: (a)
foster sound financial sector development to facilitate
access to finance to businesses and financial inclusion
for individuals; (b) generate a competitive business
environment to propitiate new enterprise creation in
all sectors of the economy, specially network sectors
shielded from competition; (c) foster innovation for
productivity and competitiveness; and (d) upgrade
infrastructure.

Fostering sound financial sector development
54. Mexico needs to broaden and deepen its financial system without compromising the financial
stability gains of the last decade. Using the financial payments system to promote financial inclusion,
improvements in financial infrastructure and capital

Toward a more competitive
business environment
56. Strengthening competition and streamlining
key regulations for firms are key to increasing Mexico’s competitiveness and unleashing productivity.
Firm-level productivity and business entry for formal
enterprises in Mexico are low, relative to international
peers. Low productivity is associated to firm size, with
larger firms having much higher productivity levels than
small ones. The large proportion of micro, small, and
medium-size enterprises (about 98 percent of all firms),
together with the fact that they are not growing in size,
is a drag on Mexico’s productivity. Factors that hinder
productivity include burdensome business regulations,
concentrated markets with dominant firms in strategic
sectors, and lack of effective pro-competition regulations.
Such restrictions limit both firm entry and the growth of
existing firms, increase the price of inputs, and reduce the
overall economy’s competitiveness. Lack of competition
reinforces existing inequities by affecting low-income
households disproportionally.
57. To contribute to unleashing productivity, the
WBG will increasingly focus on supporting policies
that favor SME growth through regulatory simplification and removal of regulatory competition barriers. In the next years, efforts will focus on the provision
of a comprehensive package of services to improve regulatory frameworks at the national and subnational level
with a special emphasis on eliminating anti-competitive
regulations.

Fostering innovation for productivity
and competitiveness
58. Several factors explain Mexico’s innovation
shortfall. Mexico’s less than adequate competition,
labor market rigidities, serious gaps in human resources,
very limited financing for startups, lack of long-term
financing to large companies, and weak links between
the productive sector and knowledge institutions have all
contributed to the innovation shortfall. Federal initiatives
to promote innovation at the subnational level have not
yielded all the desired results due to lack of capacity.

COUNTRY
PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR
THE UNITED
MEXICAN
STATES

32

59. WBG contribution to this topic concentrates
in improving the coordination of policies aiming
at taking innovations to firms in the productive
sector and supporting private investments that
boost innovation and productivity. IBRD has been
supporting the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología
(CONACYT) for a doctoral fellowship program and
programs to encourage public–private collaborative
research. Going forward, the Bank’s focus will shift to:
(a) supporting the newly created SME agency (INADEM)
to improve the effectiveness of programs to foster SME
productivity and growth, with a focus on high-growth

potential firms; and (b) supporting states with lower
GDP per capita to develop a regional innovation strategy
and regional capacities to access existing innovation
funds and programs. From a sectoral perspective, the
focus would be on improving innovation and technology
extension in the manufacturing and agricultural sector.
IFC will continue to support companies that innovate
through technology, products, or processes, giving
priority to investments related to the production of value-added products in underdeveloped sectors in which
Mexico has a competitive advantage and in companies
with strong impact in the development of SMEs through
the supply chain. Agribusiness is also a priority for IFC
given its linkages and strong impact on SMEs in rural
areas and because of its potential effect on the global
food security problem. IFC also expects to increase its
financing for Mexican companies investing overseas to
achieve knowledge transfer, regional development, and
growth. Finally, IFC, together with INADEM, is evaluating a pilot to set up a management company to invest
and provide technical support to innovative early stage
SMEs. MIGA can provide guarantees to foreign investors
in local enterprises, which can act as a catalyst for local
entrepreneurship.

Upgrading infrastructure
60. Raising the country’s productivity would require a comprehensive strategy to improve efficiency of key infrastructure services. This includes the
rail and port sectors, public management arrangements
and the role of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), and
rules and procedures governing the entire breadth of the
supply chain. Sector and institutional reforms, and substantial infrastructure investment should also be included
in this program. To contribute to the competitiveness of
the country, the IFC aims to continue supporting sectors
that are opening further to the private sector, such as
telecommunications where IFC can bring its global experience. In the case of the energy initiative currently under
discussion, if the conditions are established, IFC could be
a financing option to support long-term investments and
local companies in the sector.
61. If current IBRD capital limitations are eased
during this CPS implementation period, the WBG
could develop a substantial pipeline of financial
services and innovative instruments with particular focus on infrastructure financing. This would
be critical in the context of the financing alternatives
for President Peña Nieto’s announced spending of
US$316 billion for a 6-year infrastructure program.
IBRD, IFC, and MIGA will work jointly to maximize
impact. MIGA can also support the infrastructure sector by attracting foreign participants in PPP processes
and by facilitating financing of public projects through
its Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligations
(NHSFO) product.

Theme 2. Increasing
Social Prosperity
62. To improve social prosperity and alleviate poverty,
Mexico needs to promote labor markets and an integrated
social protection system. The objective should be to
increase wages through productivity growth and move
toward a more efficient, effective, and integrated social
protection system that will protect people from unexpected welfare losses, including those related to violence.

Promoting labor markets for inclusive growth
63. A crucial ingredient to alleviating poverty
and promoting shared prosperity is higher wages
through greater labor force productivity. Although
wages grew slowly over the past 20 years, the economic
crisis of 2009 reversed the gains; since then, Mexico has
had difficulty regaining the wage growth. The related slow
growth in labor income, the largest source of income for
families, has not translated into poverty reduction and has
limited shared prosperity. There is also a gender aspect to
this, as fewer women than men are economically active
(44 and 81 percent, respectively), and there is persistent
occupational segregation and gender wage gaps. Women,
however, work longer hours than men.
64. Measures to increase labor productivity may
work through three channels: regulations, skills,
and employment services. The first channel reduces
labor market rigidities and increases the benefits of
formality and incentives to employees who can invest
in their own human capital and skills development that
allows them to move into more productive jobs with
low risk. The second channel raises the labor-market
relevance and level of skills through a national skills
strategy. This strategy maps labor-market skills acquisition throughout the life-cycle; continued reorientation
of upper-secondary school toward the labor market;
and portability of skills across the education, training,
and labor-market systems. In spite of continuous gains
in education attainment rates, 43 percent of Mexican
employers cited difficulties filling job vacancies, as
compared to a global average of 31 percent. The third
channel improves allocative efficiency of the labor
force by facilitating job search and matching through
integrated employment services and strengthening competency-based certification.
65. A multi-year program of lending, knowledge,
and convening services has supported the labor
productivity agenda. Lending activities included the
Compensatory Education Project, which supports the
Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo (CONAFE) to expand quality early childhood development (ECD) services
to the most marginalized municipalities in Mexico and the
second phase of an Adaptable Program Loan (APL)15 for

the Quality Schools Project (PEC). These were accompanied by a richly laden program, including activities such
as evaluating the impact of Mexico’s teacher training
program on student outcomes; an impact evaluation of an
ECD program targeted at poor children living in marginalized areas; an evaluation of the school-based management
models; and an analysis of the gap between the supply
and demand for skills, both nationally and in the State of
Oaxaca.
66. The Bank will build on this program through
new activities, including: (a) reforming the labor courts
according to the recently approved labor law to lower
labor costs; (b) improving the job relevance of education
by strengthening and expanding the school-based management model, improving the reach of ECD services,
further reforming the secondary education system, and
implementing strategies to reduce upper secondary
dropout and youth inactivity; (c) supporting labor market
policies that improve the skills level, formality, and allocative efficiency of the labor force, including the National
Employment System (Sistema Nacional de Empleo); and
(d) promoting appropriate options for skills acquisition
and school-to-work transition for the poorest youth under
the Oportunidades program.
67. In parallel, IFC expects to continue supporting
skills development and employability by: ( a) investing
in private education providers that have a focus on viable
and scalable models for low- and middle-income students;
(b) supporting innovation by investing in new service delivery models to increase affordability and quality; and (c)
leveraging WBG convening power to share best practice
and foster partnerships. IFC’s education strategy in Mexico aims to expand equitable access to quality education
and affordable costs leading to employment opportunities.
MIGA can contribute to the effort by supporting projects
related to education focusing on skills development for
employment opportunities reaching underserved sectors,
and projects in other sectors that will result in job creation
and transfer of knowledge and skills.

Promoting an integrated social
protection system
68. Although Mexico has been at the forefront in
social protection policy, new reforms are needed to
build on the gains achieved and reduce inequities
and inefficiencies to begin building a more inclusive, effective, and integrated social protection system that provides protection from income shocks
and helps smooth consumption over the life-cycle.
A potential hindrance to greater social progress
is the difficult citizen security situation, which
affects certain states. The development of a national
and citizen security policy under the National Program
to Prevent Crime is a first step in providing a framework
for joint federal and subnational action. This policy

COUNTRY
PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR
THE UNITED
MEXICAN
STATES

33

should also include skills building and support to civil
servants, public and private partners, and stakeholders in
evidence-based crime and violence prevention methods;
information systems to track criminal activity to identify
hot-spots and to measure the impact of interventions;
and investment in infrastructure and social services to
establish a state presence in hot-spot communities.
69. The WB is supporting efforts at designing and
implementing second generation reforms in Mexico’s conditional cash transfer programs. Mexico’s two flagship social assistance programs are
a good base toward a more inclusive, effective,
efficient, and integrated social protection system.
While Oportunidades and Seguro Popular (Régimen
Estatal de Protección Social en Salud – REPSS) are
recognized globally for their poverty alleviation and
human capital development impacts, they represent
programs and policies and not in themselves a system.
To begin moving toward such a system, the WBG will
provide support to:
a. Develop a unified registry of beneficiaries,
as a basis for a social protection system that
provides information on how families are
accessing any social security or assistance programs. This allows for proactive management
to reduce duplication, improve efficiency of
program administration (such as unifying cash
payments from various programs into a single
monthly payment), and link families to other
eligible programs.
b. Improve functioning of the health system (particularly primary health care) by strengthening
the incentive and accountability framework
between the Federal Government; the state
through its fund holders, particularly Seguro
Popular; and providers.
c. Enhance inter-institutional links between the
Oportunidades program and education, labor
market, and ECD programs.
d. Support a transition of the health system from
one that only responds to acute illness to one
that also ensures prevention and control of
chronic conditions (i.e., non-communicable
diseases, particularly those related to obesity
such as diabetes and heart disease).

70. Migration is a potential new area of engagement. Net migration from Mexico to the United States,
which formerly absorbed some excess labor, has declined
rapidly between 2005 and 2010, in part as a result of the
impact of the crisis on the U.S. economy. The presence
and transit of Central American migrants in southern
Mexico is a long-standing concern for Mexican authorities. The implications of these migratory flows, both

in terms of labor market performance and individual
wellbeing, have prompted initial contacts with Mexican
authorities that may lead to technical support in this area
in future years.
71. To promote an inclusive, effective, and integrated social protection system, IFC investments
and advisory services will focus on supporting
the private sector players engaged with the public
sector in the delivery of social services. This will
be done by supporting players who are currently or are
planning to work with the public sector through PPPs for
delivery of services; and by providing advisory work to
local, state, or Federal Governments in the design and execution of PPPs to ensure a balance between the risks and
benefits assigned to the private sector, in order for these
partnerships to be financially feasible and bankable.
Also in this sector, MIGA can help support by attracting
foreign participants in PPP processes and by facilitating
financing of public projects through its Non-Honoring
of Sovereign Financial Obligation (NHSFO) coverage to
potential foreign investors.

Theme 3. Strengthening
Public Finances and
Government Efficiency
72. To achieve faster growth, reduce extreme poverty
and promote shared prosperity, Mexico needs to improve
public service delivery. Mexico’s public service delivery is hindered by low tax collection and expenditure
inefficiencies at all levels of government: federal, state,
and municipal. Strengthening public finances in Mexico
requires dealing with several challenges. On the income
side, Mexico needs a comprehensive fiscal reform to alleviate the looming medium-term pressures on its budget.
This fiscal reform refers to both national and subnational
public finance. On the expenditure side, Mexico needs
to improve public sector performance, and expenditure
quality and equity. The World Bank thematic engagement
aims at: (a) managing medium-term fiscal challenges at
national and subnational levels; (b) enhancing public
service delivery; and (c) implementing an integrated
sovereign risk management framework.

Managing medium-term fiscal challenges
at national and subnational levels
73. The Bank has been supporting Mexico’s efforts
to address its fiscal challenges and will continue to
provide technical support for enhancing the federal
tax revenue system. A team of international and Bank
experts in tax systems is currently working with the Ministry of Finance (SHCP) through a three-year Programmatic
Knowledge Service to study different policy options available to address fiscal pressures in an efficient, equitable,

and sustainable way. Moreover, the Bank will provide
support to the Mexican Tax Administration Office (SAT)
through a program for evaluating tax administration and
improving tax compliance through better controls of tax
obligations and empirical studies regarding lawsuits. The
Bank is also providing support through various trust funds
to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of
Public Administration (Secretaría de la Función Pública)
to implement new internal control models and modern IT
systems.
74. Despite better targeting of social spending,
some programs in Mexico disproportionally benefit the higher-income population deciles. Some
programs are very progressive as the per capita public
transfer falls with higher-income levels; others are less so
as the per capita public transfer rises with higher-income
levels. Examples of the former are conditional cash
transfer programs (Oportunidades), temporary employment program (PET), and non-contributory pensions for
the elderly. Examples of the latter are energy subsidies,
VAT exemptions and zero rating, which are, in effect,
non-targeted consumption subsidies. In the end, Mexico’s
tax-benefit system does not improve income equality as
much as in other OECD countries. Building on past diagnosis, the Bank will continue to provide technical support
on monitoring and evaluating the design, impact, and distributive incidence of fiscal policies and social programs
as well as providing recommendations for enhancing its
progressivity. The Bank will also support the development
of a methodology and quantitative estimates for a social
discount rate, which will help the SHCP to better select
investments and evaluate the return of social programs.
75. The challenge of subnational public finance.
Recent experience with the rapid increase in subnational
borrowing and the lack of fiscal sustainability in some
states has created a political momentum to move from a
market discipline to a fiscal rules-based approach. Legislative proposals, currently under discussion in Congress,
include a balanced budget requirement at the subnational
level, the oversight and possibility of intervention by the
Federal Government in subnational public finances, as
well as the ability of the Federal Government to extend a
guarantee for specific subnational borrowings.
76. In addition to the ongoing engagement with
the Federal Government around the challenges of
subnational public finance, the World Bank also
provides technical support to subnational entities
directly. As part of the growing engagement around this
topic, the Bank also plans to develop a programmatic
knowledge program to support SHCP in setting up a
unit that will be responsible for the implementation and
supervision required under the new subnational fiscal
discipline and borrowing framework. The Bank is also
providing support to strengthen the institutional capacity of public sector management in the States of Puebla
and Oaxaca. Technical analysis of tax administration in

Distrito Federal and management capacities in the State
of Oaxaca initially done in 2011 is an ongoing reimbursable advisory service to these entities.

Enhancing service delivery through
better public sector management
77. There has been good progress on three main
fronts of the public sector modernization agenda in
Mexico: (a) harmonizing accounting at the federal and
subnational levels; (b) introducing performance-informed
budgeting, a comprehensive Government Accounting
System (SCG) and implementation of a single treasury
account; and (c) building on the success of procurement
reform in centralized government and sector delivery
units to strengthen core public sector management functions. However, further actions are needed to strengthen
those core functions, particularly at the subnational level.
As experience from other countries shows, setting up a
performance-informed system requires a culture change,
with a new management style based on performance incentives; management delegation; and a focus on inputs,
outputs, and outcomes. Currently World Bank support
related to public sector efficiency includes financial
services results-based management and budgeting.
78. Knowledge products are enhancing public
sector efficiency and effectiveness. Grants supporting
an IT system at the supreme audit institution will function
as a risk management tool and enhance professional
competencies of its staff as well as strengthen the audit
function with new tools and techniques. Technical support
for strengthening management capacities is currently provided to the Federal Government, the National Congress,
and the States of Oaxaca and Puebla. The World Bank is
also providing technical support with the implementation
of integrated financial management information systems
(SIDAFF) to include financial accounting at different
levels. Reimbursable services are planned to fund the
next generation of procurement reforms, particularly in
modernizing the government’s Compranet system and in
raising standards of administrative procedures. Finally,
as a means to respond to growing societal concerns about
the efficiency and transparency of public expenditures,
the Bank will support a public expenditure review in
coordination with federal and subnational agencies.

Implementing an integrated risk
management strategy
79. Exposure to risk at the sovereign level, which
depends on both the external environment and
internal conditions, is more efficiently managed
within an integrated framework. The impact of external shocks can be amplified or reduced depending on
the sovereign’s internal degree of exposure to the shocks.
This in turn depends on the authorities’ proactive drive

PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR
THE UNITED
MEXICAN
STATES

35

to identify and quantify the various types of risk, and to
analyze them in an integrated and centralized manner so
as to more efficiently manage this risk.
80. The Government of Mexico has increasingly
addressed a number of direct and contingent risks.
An important goal has been to meet the balanced budget
target and avoid highly disruptive and costly adjustments
during the annual budget implementation. Consequently,
the Government has sought to diminish the vulnerability
of public finances to a number of direct shocks and risks
related to fluctuations in GDP growth; oil price volatility,
as well as interest, exchange rate; and refinancing volatility and its impact on the debt and other financial portfolios.
The Government has also addressed a number of potential
or contingent sources of risk such as natural disasters,
food price volatility and agricultural risk, climate change,
and subnational governments in fiscal distress. In spite of
continued strong progress in all its policy areas, a Fiscal
Risk Management DPL of US$300.8 million in support of
Mexico’s fiscal risk management policies was withdrawn
on September 20, 2013 in the absence of its signature
within eighteen months from the Board approval. A completion note is under preparation.
81. The World Bank has been supporting the
Government in dealing with environmental and
economic risks through the delivery of an on-going
comprehensive package of services for disaster
risk management and by using IBRD financial risk
management tools. Through the World Bank MultiCat
(multiple catastrophe) Program and jointly with private
sector partners, the Government has successively issued
two parametric catastrophe bonds for US$290 million
and US$315 million in 2009 and 2012, respectively.
Forthcoming activities to address contingent fiscal risks
more generally will include continued use of IBRD
risk management tools on loan portfolio and non-IBRD
liabilities (e.g., interest rate conversions and stand-alone
interest rate swaps).

82. The World Bank is also providing several
knowledge services on risk management. A multiyear programmatic engagement in disaster risk management supports the Government of Mexico to build an
effective disaster risk management strategy that balances
risk identification; investments in risk reduction measures; efficient ex post reconstruction activities; and use of
risk-financing tools, including risk transfer mechanisms.
In addition, knowledge services are contributing to the
design of a comprehensive agricultural risk management
strategy by both evaluating Mexico’s current system and
providing sound policy and program alternatives aimed at
ameliorating processes such as risk identification; institutional risk management analysis; risk quantification and
pricing; and utilization of innovative market-based risk
financing tools, including risk transfer mechanisms.

Theme 4. Promoting Green
and Inclusive Growth
83. Mexico’s significant natural resource capital,
the high cost of environmental degradation, and the
increasing risks posed by climate change highlight
the importance of a green-growth agenda addressing critical policy concerns:the footprint of growth
(externalities), including urban planning, solid waste
management, energy efficiency; and managing natural
assets under pressure–focusing on forest, biodiversity and
water management, and renewable energy.

Reducing the footprint of growth
84. Fast urban development has been inefficient
and needs to be greener. The fast urbanization rate
(estimated at 77 percent) is car-oriented, inefficient, and
not conducive to generating economies of scale in production, movements of labor and capital, and resource consumption. To address these issues, Mexico needs to focus
on making urban development greener, more efficient and
resilient, and socially inclusive. This can be initiated by:
(a) reviewing housing policies to develop compact spaces
that are both efficient and livable; (b) providing urban
layouts needed to promote public and non-motorized
transport; (c) supporting the development of mass transit
in appropriate corridors and creating a mobility strategy;
(d) using land-based financing instruments to provide
infrastructure in new low-income housing developments;
and (e) integrating risk reduction policies in urban development instruments.
85. Costs of land and water degradation due to
solid and liquid wastes have been increasing each
year, impacting human health, the environment,
and the economy. The following areas require particular attention: (a) developing an integrated urban solid
waste management strategy; (b) strengthening management capacity at municipal, state, and federal levels; (c)
reviewing sector policies (including tariff system) that
would allow cost recovery; (d) developing waste reduction
and recycling awareness campaigns; (e) developing sound
social inclusion plans for waste pickers; (f) addressing
problems posed by hundreds of contaminated sites and
planning for their closure and redevelopment; and (g)
exploring the potential of waste to energy schemes.
86. Enhancing energy efficiency is also a key element in promoting low carbon development for
the country. Necessary actions include: (a) promoting
the adoption of energy efficiency labels and standards in
housing, transport, and small businesses; (b) encouraging
a greater private sector participation in the development
of industry-wide efforts to increase energy efficiency, as
well as in the creation of commercial options to finance
energy-efficiency initiatives; (c) strengthening regulation

in the energy sector for a commercially oriented and more
efficient operation in PEMEX and Federal Electricity
Commission (CFE); and (d) phasing out energy subsidies.
87. The World Bank has a very robust program to
support the reduction of the footprint of growth. In
financing services, an ongoing project is supporting bus
rapid transit solutions in cities and states, complemented
by the Government’s Programa de Transporte Masivo
(PROTRAM), which provides technical support to the
same target clients in the design of comprehensive urban
transport plans. Funding from the Clean Technology Fund
(CTF) is supporting the acquisition of clean technology
buses, enhancing the scope of the project not only to improve mobility but also to reduce GHG emissions. A GEF
grant is supporting several Mexican cities in their efforts
for clean air, and a carbon finance operation is supporting
improvements to the Corredor Insurgentes Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) system in Mexico City. Another GEF grant
is providing state-of-the-art knowledge to Mexico City
on initiatives to open data in transport and supply-side
schemes to reduce trips in heavily congested areas of the
city. Reimbursable Advisory Service to support Mexico’s
national urban transport strategy was completed recently,
and further advisory work is possible.
88. The Bank is also building on a long partnership with the Government in the housing sector to
support its current efforts to increase densities in
urban areas. In particular, the Bank will be launching
in FY14 a programmatic approach that will include an
urbanization review, a diagnostic of the main urban challenges in the country, and recommendations to inform a
national urban policy. The programmatic approach will
also include a Reimbursable Advisory Service in housing
policy to improve the efficiency of subsidy programs, to
strengthen rental markets and construction finance, and
to increase the dynamism of the secondary market.
89. The Bank has launched a diagnostic of key
issues and players in solid waste management with
the longer-term objective of supporting a national
program. This program could help cities in the formulation of coherent and comprehensive strategies as well
as specific projects and financing mechanisms to manage
solid waste and contaminated sites. The goal is to cover
the entire cycle from reduction, recycling, generation,
collection, disposal, and possible transformation, using
regional resources optimally.
90. The World Bank foresees a rich program to support GHG emissions reduction. The ongoing Efficient
Lighting and Appliances Project successfully supports
government programs to reduce emissions by increasing
the use of energy-efficient technologies at the residential
level. The Bank also supports some states in the preparation of action plans to improve efficiency in city buildings.
Four knowledge services are planned: (a) the preparation
of National Appropriate Mitigation Actions on integrated

urban mobility systems, refrigerators, and urban services;
(b) the development of in-country capacity to design and
implement projects capturing carbon dioxide from power
generation and industrial installations and subsequent
carbon capture and sequestration; (c) the implementation
of strategies to reduce gas venting and flaring; and (d) a
political economy assessment of the impact of reducing or
phasing out energy subsidies.
91. IFC’s contribution to reduce the footprint of
growth involves both advisory services and direct
financing. IFC covers mainly the following areas: (a)
solid waste management activities and waste to energy
projects; (b) a programmatic green buildings initiative
and support to development of sustainable construction
projects that follow international codes for energy and
water efficiency; (c) energy efficiency-related projects and
companies; and (d) urban mobility. IFC is engaged in the
state of Puebla providing transaction advisory support to
develop bus rapid transport routes in the form of PPPs.

Using natural resources in an optimal way
92. Despite their strategic environmental and
social role, forests are subject to high degradation
in Mexico. Policy options to reverse this negative trend
include: (a) shifting funds from reforestation to community forestry and paying for environmental services; (b)
strengthening advisory and monitoring systems; (c) fostering sustainable and competitive community enterprises;
(d) developing approaches for forests with high biodiversity values but relatively low commercial value; (e) promoting cross-sector coordination and public participation
in policymaking; and (f) developing a landscape approach
to analyze forestry in the larger context of integrated rural
development.
93. Per capita water availability has decreased by
an alarming factor of four in the last 50 years. This
situation is compounded by an inefficient use of water resources in agriculture as well as in urban services and exacerbated by the impact of climate change. Service quality
is below OECD standards and cost recovery is extremely
low. Critical actions include: (a) implementing an effective water financing system with incentives for an optimal
use of water resources; (b) consolidating the information
base for climate resilience, water management, and water
sanitation and drainage services; (c) strengthening the
enforcement of water rights; (d) improving the efficiency
of water usage in the agriculture sector; (e) bringing efficiency and quality of urban services up to regional OECD
standards; and (f) supporting local governments in the
provision of works and sanitation services. The priorities
of the government in the water sector will be identified
in its National Water Plan (Plan Hídrico Nacional) being
drafted. In preliminary discussions with the current
administration, the National Water Agency, CONAGUA,
has indicated several priority areas in which is interested

COUNTRY
PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR
THE UNITED
MEXICAN
STATES

37

in partnering with the Bank, namely: (i) integrated urban
water management; (ii) urban flood management; (iii) water supply and sanitation utility reform beyond efficiency
improvements; and (iv) resilience of infrastructure to
extreme events and climate variability.
94. The possibility of Mexico turning into a net oil
importer poses the challenges of radically transforming the country’s energy matrix composition.
Key options lie in further using renewable energy sources;
involving the private sector in financing investments in
renewable energy; and exploring the potential to expand
geothermal, solar, and wind power. The WBG will continue supporting Mexico in these areas through a suite of
financial, knowledge, and convening services. The Bank
is preparing a knowledge programmatic approach that
will include the topics of environmental legislation, environment-related public finance, and adaptation to climate
change at state level. The Bank has also discussed the
possibility of an Ecosystems-DPL to continue supporting
government policies in climate change mitigation and
adaptation. Ongoing GEF grants are promoting adaptation to the consequences of climate impacts in coastal
watersheds and wetlands and promoting the conservation
of priority biological corridors. A meteorological modernization project is supporting equipment, modeling,
and forecasting capacity; and the upgrading of several
regional centers. A forests and climate change project
(REDD+) is supporting rural communities to sustainably
manage their forests while reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. The Bank is also promoting the
adoption of emission-reduction technologies in small and
medium-scale agri-business.
95. The World Bank is supporting the improvement
of efficiency in water utilities through financial and
knowledge services. In addition to an ongoing project
in water-efficiency improvement, the Bank is preparing
a water and sanitation project in the State of Oaxaca
covering regulatory issues as well as improvement of
the quality, and sustainability of water services in rural
and urban areas. Technical support at the state level is
an emerging area of interest. The Bank has prepared a

comprehensive analysis of the water financing system,
an important input to ensure the sustainability of water
provision in years to come. The Bank may provide a RAS,
requested by the national water agency to prepare water
basin diagnostic studies in order to develop a comprehensive water management system in the Mexico Valley.
96. WBG projects on wind and solar energy, and
combined solar-thermal cycles have helped the
Government of Mexico break ground on renewables and energy diversification. A new GEF grant
will help promote innovation in the development and
implementation of clean energy technologies through
Mexico’s Sustainable Energy Fund.
97. The World Bank is planning to launch a new
multi-year knowledge and convening programmatic
engagement in FY14 to address the need to institutionalize environmental and social safeguards with
the objective of moving toward the use of country
systems in the future.
98. IFC is also contributing to the optimal management of natural resources. IFC financed the first
utility-scale photovoltaic solar project in Latin America
and expects that its risk taking in renewable energy will
further unlock the potential of Mexico’s renewable power
potential. Through its advisory and investment activities,
IFC expects to strengthen its collaboration with the
Mexican Infrastructure Fund to support municipal water
operators in improving their operations and efficiency via
PPP schemes. In forestry, the priorities are: (a) contributing to take pressure off natural forest for wood supply by
supporting investment in commercial tree plantations; (b)
increasing the sustainable use of already degraded land;
and (c) supporting the expansion of certified forests. As
an emerging player, MIGA can contribute to the effort by
supporting foreign investments in carbon mitigating projects, waste management, water treatment and delivery,
renewable energy, and other efficiency-related sectors, as
well as attracting private participants in PPP processes
and financing of government-sponsored projects through
NHSFO coverage.

V. Portfolio and
Lending Program

99. This CPS describes the Bank’s indicative engagement with Mexico as a partnership to achieve development results through a tailored package of financial,
knowledge, and convening services. IBRD lending has
remained an important part of this engagement throughout the years. However, Mexico is now approaching the
single borrower limit (SBL) of US$16.5 billion. Mexico
is the largest IBRD borrower with outstanding debt of
US$14.78 billion as of September 30, 2013, representing
some 10 percent of IBRD’s total portfolio. After pre-paying some US$5 billion during FY07 to bring down its
exposure to US$4.1 billion, Mexico’s exposure increased
rapidly from FY08 with the unleashing of the global
financial crisis and surge in IBRD lending: US$12.5
billion commitments in FY09-11 and decline in the size
of repayments of loans following a large prepayment of
loans in FY07.

Bank’s ability to further support Mexico’s efforts to reduce
poverty and enhance the incomes of the less well-off will
be limited despite the increased demand for development
finance. The WBG is engaging with the Mexican authorities on possible alternatives to position the Group within
the Government’s new US$316 billion infrastructure program and in supporting subnational programs. In parallel,
country management is ensuring the most effective use
of the combined WBG balance sheets. The Bank is also
pro-actively pursuing leveraging of IBRD funding with
other development partners. Nevertheless, these efforts
will be insufficient to support Mexico’s financing needs
without a significant increase in IBRD lending capacity
for Mexico.
101. As of September 30, 2013, the active WBG
portfolio consisted of 12 IBRD projects and 5 full
GEF operations for a net commitment of US$4.26
billion. The average age of IBRD projects dropped from
4 years in FY08 to 3 years in FY12, but increased back to

100. IBRD lending capacity will need to be
increased. As Mexico approaches the SBL limit, the

4.1 years in FY13 due to the extension of several energy
and GEF projects. Disbursement ratio has been steadily
high (Table 4). The Bank is implementing some 40 trust
funds, including a large Clean Technology Fund and GEF
program for US$455 million.
102. Since 2008, IEG has evaluated 22 projects of which
64 percent has been rated “satisfactory” or “moderately
satisfactory”. Representing 8.5 percent of commitments,
currently there are 7 projects in problem status (or 41
percent of projects), concentrated in renewable energy
and transport projects with complex and innovative
procurement. Restructurings/cancellations have taken
place within the last year in five of the problem projects
and are in process in the remaining two projects. These
portfolio actions have untangled implementation and
contracting bottlenecks and should yield disbursements
shortly, improving the health of the portfolio. Sector-specific portfolio reviews will also help address systemic
implementation issues.
103. The level of IBRD lending within the development
solutions thematic engagements discussed in Section IV
will depend upon: (a) IBRD exposure management developments and leveraging options; (b) subnational demand
for financing; and (c) the conditions of global financial
markets. Overall, IBRD capacity to respond to a large
increase in financing demand is currently constrained by
the SBL. In this context, the indicative firm IBRD lending
program for FY14 and FY15 is expected to be US$350
million and US$700 million, respectively (Table 6).
Mexican authorities have indicated that if IBRD were to
increase its lending capacity, they would be interested in
developing a more substantial pipeline, with a particular
focus on infrastructure.

VI. Risks and Mitigation

104. Four potential risks may impact the results
achievement of the CPS: weakened political support, international economic environment, program performance,
and crime and violence.
105. Political support for reforms may weaken.
The political economy of addressing key structural rigidities for improved labor productivity and greater market
competition and innovation, particularly in the energy
sector, is still undetermined and bound to be difficult.
However, the strategic areas identified in the Mexico
NDP received broad acceptance by the population, and
the new administration has already enacted key reforms
in the education and telecommunications sector. Failure
of reform implementation could impact results negatively
and will require adjusting the strategy and expected outcomes to the emerging realities while capturing lessons
learned. Flexibility embedded in the CPS would allow
this adjustment.
106. Little room exists for countercyclical lending
in the context of limited SBL space. The risk of a less
favorable international context, and in particular changes
in global monetary policies and a sluggish US economy,
may impact foreign exchange markets, domestic financial
markets, and global financial flows. Renewed fiscal
pressure for quick disbursing IBRD financing is bound
to be limited given the size of the exposure envelope. In
addressing this risk, the WBG is undertaking a comprehensive assessment of its financial instruments to provide
viable alternatives to the authorities.
107. CPS program performance could be at risk
at the national and subnational levels. A sizable
undisbursed amount of some US$1.8 billion remains to
be implemented over the next 3-4 years. In addressing
portfolio performance, close supervision and portfolio

restructurings would help improve the performance of
problem projects. To tackle implementation issues, proactive portfolio management, including strong follow
up on recent restructurings and sector-specific portfolio
performance review (together with related knowledge
programs) should yield disbursements and improve the
health of the portfolio. The filtering process presented
in this CPS will also serve to maintain program focus to
the WBG goals while maintaining flexibility to respond to
emerging client needs, including at the subnational level.
The close management of the thematic business plans,
programmatic approaches, and the wholesaling of country
budgets around results will help maintain attention to
strategic outcomes while maintaining the flexibility to
adjust the programs to evolving country circumstances
and build in continuous learning. The WBG will systematically assess Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC)
issues in all subnational activities.
108. Risks from crime and violence to the program.
Mexico’s national homicide rate has more than doubled
between 2007 and 2010, increasing 114 percent between
2005 and 2011. An increase in drug- and firearm-related
homicides, principally among young men, concentrated in
particular cities, explain this upward trend in crime and
violence. However, the WBG engagement is not concentrated in areas of crime and violence (mostly border-states
with the US) reducing the chances of negative impact
to the program. The WB will continue to monitor trends
in crime and violence, providing support through the
dissemination of its recent youth violence report, inputs
to the proposed urbanization review, areas of engagement
in access to social protection, and as part of other regional
products on citizen security. The WB is also preparing
a multi-year citizens’ security knowledge and convening
programmatic engagement in FY14 to support the Government’s crime and violence prevention efforts.

10. Reduced deforestation
together with increase in
certified forest areas.

Forest degradation is reason for concern,
as forests represent an essential source of
employment, income, and livelihood for about
12 million people, and play an important role
in mitigating and adapting to climate change.

11. Improved water
management systems
and expanded access
to water services.

Water availability decreased dramatically
over the past 50 years. Situation
worsened by inefficient use of water in
agriculture and urban services. Service
quality is below OECD standards.

12. Increased

Thematic Engagement 10. Reducing the Footprint of Growth
(i) Invest in basic,
complementary, and

infrastructure projects;
and (ii) provide
basic services, housing
quality, and community
social infrastructure
in Priority Areas with
high and very high
marginalization (2.2.1).

the recycling of
materials; and (iii)
minimizes risks to the
population and the
environment (4.4.3).

to foster a competitive,
sustainable, resilient
and low-carbon
economy.
Promote the use of
advanced, energy
efficient technologies
and systems that
contribute to the
reduction of GHG
emissions (4.4.3).

Urban development in
Mexico has been steadfast (77% urbanization
rate), car-oriented,
and inefficient, with
low-density patterns
that are not conducive
to generate economies
of scale in: production;
movements of labor and
capital; and resource
consumption.
Costs of land and water
degradation due to solid

Completion report
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This Country Partnership Strategy Completion
Report (CPSCR) is a self-evaluation by the World Bank
Group (WBG) team of its performance in implementing
the Country Partnership Strategy FY08-13 (Report #
42846-MX). The CPS FY08-13 was jointly prepared
by the World Bank and IFC in collaboration with the
Government of Mexico. It was well aligned both with
Mexico’s six-year political cycle and the country priorities of President Calderon’s administration as stated in
the 2007-12 National Development Plan (NDP). Early in
its implementation, the CPS provided a framework for a
strong and flexible knowledge-focused partnership with
a more limited financing relationship and focused knowledge and financial engagement in five key thematic areas:
(a) accelerating growth; (b) improving competitiveness;
(c) promoting social inclusion and reducing poverty; (d)
developing infrastructure and assuring energy security
and environmental sustainability; and (e) strengthening
institutions.

2. The CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) FY08-10
(Report #52776-MX) reaffirmed its support to
the five original themes but adapted the World
Bank Group (WBG) strategy with a new integrated engagement model to address client needs in
the context of evolving country developments
and global challenges. This new engagement model
sought to maximize the impact of a tailored package
of WBG financial, knowledge, and convening services.
The CPS was flexible enough to provide fast response
to emerging financing needs to the public and private
sector following the 2008-09 global financial crisis,
while delivering a broad knowledge agenda using integrated and tailored packages of services in delivering

development solutions. The Government requested
financing in order to have access to disbursements
of a record US$7 billion over the two-year period
(CY09-10) to meet the global challenge. The initial
CPS program was strategically adapted to accelerate
disbursements through policy-based loans addressing
key structural reforms and several quick-disbursing
investment loans targeted to the poor. Knowledge
services, organized around integrative programmatic
approaches, leveraged World Bank resources and
grants around priority CPS themes. The knowledge
program experienced a gradual shift from traditional
economic sector work (ESW) reports to just-in-time
pieces, programmatic approaches, and demand-driven
reimbursable services, showing flexibility and responsiveness to evolving client demand.
3. While lending volumes declined after the crisis
for IBRD, IFC financing increased significantly in
a countercyclical path. IBRD lending declined from
US$6.4 billion approved in FY09 to US$50 million in
FY12. Key areas of IBRD support in response to the
global crisis included poverty alleviation and increased
social safety nets, as well as structural reforms in housing, environmental, and climate change sustainability.
IFC commitments, however, expanded from US$84
million in FY09 to a robust US$1,768 million at the end
of FY13, following strong demand for its financing and
integrated solutions to private sector development challenges. IFC demand increased mostly in the financial
markets, manufacturing, retail, and property sectors.
The IFC Mexico program focused on strategic priorities
of operating in frontier regions, supporting micro, small,
and medium-size enterprises and reducing the private
sector’s impact on climate change.
4. The WBG knowledge program remains its

comparative advantage. Demand for WBG knowledge and convening services have become an essential
component of the WBG engagement with Mexico. WBG
knowledge and advisory products have matured through
innovative client-driven approaches aligned to critical
strategic and global areas such as addressing the climate
change challenge.
5. The CPSCR describes and evaluates the support
provided through the delivery of a new approach
in packaging financial, knowledge, and convening
services aimed to provide tailored development
solutions. The CPSCR takes into account the crucial
role that knowledge and convening services played
alongside financial services to achieve CPS outcomes in
the five key thematic areas.
6. The CPSCR seeks two main purposes: 
First,
evaluate the performance of the CPS program in achieving the outcomes the WBG expected to influence within
the CPS period as stated in the updated CPSPR results
matrix; and second, assess the performance of the WBG
in delivering the joint World Bank-IFC CPS program.
7. In summary, program performance was
“satisfactory” a nd the WBG performance in implementing the strategy was “satisfactory”, based on an
extensive analysis of the CPS program achieving the
objectives throughout the six-year implementation
period. Lessons from the evaluation of the closing CPS
will help formulate the new CPS program for the next
six years.

II. COUNTRY
DEVELOPMENTS
8. The strategic focus of the Government of Mexico
was to confront longstanding challenges. By December
2006, the Mexican economy had transformed its export
base from a dependence on petroleum products to
manufacturing goods. Fiscal discipline and strong fiscal
policy and debt management frameworks enabled the
authorities to conduct an adequate countercyclical policy response to the 2008-09 financial crisis; the financial
system, having been battered by the 1995 crisis, had
been rebuilt and a sound regulatory framework was well
established. The authorities took appropriate actions
to maintain order in foreign exchange and domestic
financial markets.
9. Mexico faced a deteriorating global economic
environment along with the parallel negative
impacts of the food crisis and the influenza pandemic, as well as other internal issues related to
organized crime. In mid-2008, investment in dynamic

export sectors suffered as a result of the downturn, and
job losses had an impact on poverty rates.18
10. Moreover, remittance flows also declined as the
Mexican immigrant population in the United States
suffered significant job losses.19
11. Credit to the private sector was also constrained, as
local branches of international commercial banks became
hesitant to lend and even hoarded liquidity. Economic
activity declined by 4.7 percent in 2009. The difficult
economic and social situation was exacerbated in April
by the AH1N1 influenza epidemic in Mexico, which was
estimated to have reduced GDP by 0.3 to 0.5 percent
in 2009. Moreover, organized crime (drug trafficking,
kidnappings, killings, etc.) had direct and indirect costs
to the country’s economy, including expenditures made
by individuals, firms, and governments to prevent or
respond to crime, as well as the multiplicative effects
or externalities created by criminal actions, such as
reductions in economic growth or limited governance.20
12. After the global financial crisis of 2008,
Mexico experienced a deep but brief recession in
2009. Growth resurged despite turbulence in Europe,
in part because of the slow but steady recovery in the
United States. Real GDP growth expanded 5.1 percent
in 2010, moderating to 4.0 and 3.8 percent in 2011 and
2012, with an expected deceleration to 1.5 percent in
2013.

III. PROGRAM
PERFORMANCE
13. The program performance evaluation reports on
expected CPS program results as revised by the CPSPR.
During the CPS period, the Bank centered its support
in five thematic areas that contained 28 CPS outcomes
(Table 1). Overall, the WBG program performance is rated
“satisfactory”.
14. The analysis of results in each thematic area is organized as follows: (a) sector context and challenges facing
the thematic area; (b) introduction to CPS outcomes for
each theme; and (c) package of financial, knowledge, and
convening services for each CPS outcome. Each outcome
presents the results of the IBRD-IFC joint program and
provides a comprehensive assessment of all elements of
the WBG program (not just lending activities). Details
of the program performance are presented in Annex 1A,
Summary of CPS Program Self-evaluation, providing a
clear assessment of each CPS outcome, a brief reference
to supporting evidence, and specific lessons or suggestions derived from the evaluation to be taken into account
by the new CPS program.

Not Achieved

15. To achieve a sustainable level of growth of 5 percent,
this theme focused on Mexico’s agenda of long-term reforms
to strengthen public finances, improve the business climate,
promote regulatory reform, enhance innovation, as well as
investment in infrastructure and human capital. Yet, with
the advent of the global crisis in 2008, support shifted to

focus on the immediate challenges of stabilizing the fiscal
accounts and reactivating the economy, while still advancing
longer-term reforms. The program focused on the following
outcomes: (a) promoting measures to enhance medium-term
fiscal sustainability and countercyclical fiscal policies; (b)
promoting regulatory reforms to foster financial sector access
and consumer protection; (c) enhancing short-term employment programs, while stimulating labor market efficiency
and productivity; and (d) improving trade competitiveness
by reducing and simplifying tariffs and customs processing.

Countercyclical Fiscal Policies During 2009
While Adopting Measures to Enhance Medium
Term Fiscal Sustainability for 2010 and Beyond,
Including an Increase in Non-oil Tax Revenue and
Improvements to Public Expenditure Management
16. At the time of the crisis, market concerns about
Mexico focused on falling oil production and the ability to maintain the 2009 fiscal stimulus. At the core of
the Bank’s response to support the authorities was an
Economic Response DPL of US$1.5 billion. The operation built on previous knowledge services, including
Bank studies on capital markets development and
financial sector competitiveness. In addition, it built on
just-in-time technical assistance to support economic
policies that helped mitigate the negative effect of the
crisis, assess its distributional impacts, and strengthen
the framework for economic recovery. Programmatic
Knowledge Services on public expenditure management
successfully informed policymakers in these areas in
preparation of the long-awaited fiscal reform. Despite
the crisis, non-oil tax income increased from 9.9 percent
of GDP in 2008 to 10.0 percent in 2010, although less
than the 10.3 percent expected partly due to higher than
expected growth. Yet, as a result of a recently approved
fiscal reform on October 31, 2013, the Mexican Ministry
of Finance expects to raise non-oil tax income from 9.9
percent in 2013 to 10.3 percent in 2014. [The expected outcome was “partially achieved”.]

Implementation of Regulatory Reforms
to Foster Financial Sector Access,
Consumer Protection and Stability
17. The financial sector, which withstood the global
financial crisis, was seen as an important player in Mexico’s economic recovery. In response to the impact of the
global financial crisis on the real economy, the WBG built
on its longstanding policy dialogue and investment track
record with Mexico on financial sector development, including a series of initiatives: (a) to increase competition
and provide better financial services to the private sector
and consumers; and (b) to deepen financial markets, as
measured by increased financing, including bank credit,
publicly traded debt, and equity investment. [The expected outcome was “achieved” and exceeded.]
18. In FY12, a Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP)
provided a roadmap over the medium term for reforms
aimed at strengthening financial sector stability and
foster sound financial sector development. The Bank
supported these efforts with technical assistance to the
Ministry of Finance and a report recommending reforms
in the regulation of the insurance and annuities market.
In addition, the Bank prepared several grants for assessing the poverty and distributional impacts of the financial
crisis and providing evidence-based and gender-sensitive policy advice.

19. A package of ongoing financial and technical
operations with the development bank BANSEFI also
contributed to give access to financial services to more
than 600,000 low-income families and to more than 10
million clients in 2012 (above the 9 million target). For
Mexico as a whole, the number of outlets providing financial services increased to 20,297 in 2012 from 10,354
in 2010, more than the 35 percent expected for 2010 by
the CPS. Mexico was also successful in focusing global
attention to the topic of financial inclusion as the World
Bank shared its experience in this topic during Mexico’s
G20 Presidency during 2012.
20. IFC supported financial sector deepening by investing in BANORTE, the only locally controlled large bank
in Mexico, which received a common equity investment
of up to US$150 million to strengthen its balance sheet
and help resume the lending activity in the country.
IFC’s Advisory and Investment Services included: (a)
housing finance aimed at lower-income households; (b)
microfinance to service microloans in frontier regions;
and (c) SME finance/ agribusiness investments in Finterra, Agrofinanzas, and in Mifel. At the end of the CPS
period, Agrofinanzas reached over 5,000 farmers and
Compartamos, Finterra, Mifel, and Agrofinanzas together
supported a total of 2.8 million loans for micro, small, and
medium-size enterprises for a volume of US$1.6 billion.

Enhancement of Short-Term Employment
Support Programs While Developing
Medium-Term Reforms for Labor Market
Efficiency and Labor Productivity
21. During the 2008-09 recession, the Mexican labor
market experienced a severe crisis. The expansion of the
Temporary Employment Program (PET) supported by the
Economic Response DPL provided a financial buffer for
lower-income segments of the population, substantially
increasing the number of hired beneficiaries through
PET from 365,000 in 2008 to 897,000 in 2010 (above the
650 thousand target for 2010). The DPL built on Bank’s
knowledge services with the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL) on productivity and employment. A
series of policy papers, notes, and micro-simulation exercises complemented targeted just-in-time assistance.
[The expected outcome was “achieved”.]

Improved Competitiveness by Lowering
International Trade Costs via Reduction of
MFN Tariffs and Simplification of the Trade
Tariff Regime and Customs Processes
22. In December 2008, Mexico adopted an ambitious
reduction of its Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rates
for nonagricultural products. The World Bank supported
this effort through the Economic Response DPL and a
package of knowledge and convening services. The

COUNTRY
PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR
THE UNITED
MEXICAN
STATES

57

average general MFN tariff rate fell from 10.4 percent in
2008 to 5.3 percent in 2010, (i.e. the CPS 2010 target),
and may reach 4.3 percent by the end of 2013. Several
indicators were also used to measure progress towards
simplification of tariff regime. The reduction in rates and
increase in the number of duty free tariff lines resulted
in a simpler tariff structure. The number of duty free
tariff lines was increased from 20 percent in 2008 to 58.7
percent in 2010 and to 61 percent in 2011. The reforms
supported by the Bank rationalized the borrower’s tariff
structure, reduced distortions, and simplified Mexico’s
trade regime.
23. The Bank’s financial support also built on a Customs Assessment Tool for Trade (CATT) that improved
trade quality by promoting excellence in customs
performance management; technical assistance on agricultural trade for sensitive agricultural commodities;
and South-South knowledge exchanges with Africa,
Asia, and other Latin American countries. These activities achieved their goals of assisting the Government
of Mexico in designing policies to respond to changes
in market conditions for strategically important crops,
linking extension services with agricultural financing,
and promoting Mexico’s competitiveness in an environment of commodity price volatility. At the same time,
IFC committed US$54 million in guarantees through
the Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) to ensure the
flow of trade credit in the Mexican market. Despite this
volume of commitments in the CPS period, Mexico’s
demand for GTFP is low, relative to other countries in
the program, mostly due to strong and established trade

learning outcomes of children by increasing the number
of basic education schools participating in the quality
improvement program, known as Programa de Escuelas
de Calidad (PEC), from 39,000 to over 50,000 schools.
As of June 2013, over 26 percent of all basic education
schools are participating in the PEC program, up from
20 percent in 2010 and well above the 23 percent
CPS target set for 2014. [The expected outcome was
“achieved”.]

Greater Support for Improved Coverage and
Quality of Education in Poor Municipalities
26. The School Based Management project phases I
and II helped to improve the quality of education as
measured by increased coverage, social participation
and educational outcomes. The School Based Management I project contributed to increase the number of
schools participating in the Quality Schools Program
(PEC) from 10.3 percent during 2006 to 20.35 percent
in 2009. With the support of the School Based Management II, by January 2013, the percentage of basic
and special education schools participating in PEC
increased from 20.3 percent to 26.7 percent. The
percentage of poor schools located in highly marginalized and marginalized areas participating in the PEC
program also increased from 38.4 percent in 2010 to
44.5 percent in 2013 (the project is on track to meet
the 55% outcome for 2014). [The expected outcome
was “achieved”].

Improved Relevance of Upper
Secondary Education

24. CPS outcomes supported by the Bank to improve
Mexico’s competitiveness included:(a) strengthening and
expanding the Government’s quality schools program;
(b) greater support for improved coverage and quality of
education in poor municipalities; (c) improving upper
secondary education; (d) equitably expanding tertiary
education through student assistance; and (e) improving
human skills, infrastructure, links between local and
global companies, and the financial, legal and regulatory
framework for information technology (IT).

27. The Bank supported the Government through DPLs
improving the quality and relevance of upper secondary
education.22 These DPLs resulted in increased flexibility
of the upper secondary system since all federal schools
now accept student transfers and validate curriculum
equivalencies, and in better student learning as evidenced by improved ENLACE mathematics scores. By
2011, 100 percent of federal schools implemented the
competence-based curriculum, well above the 50 percent CPS target for 2011. Supporting knowledge services
helped understand better the causes of upper secondary
school dropout and recommended policy options for education services to the poorest. [The expected outcome
was “achieved”.]

Strengthening and Expanding the
Government’s Quality School Program

Equitable Expansion of Tertiary Education
Through Student Assistance

25. The Bank provided support to improve the quality
of education as measured by coverage and social participation, through a series of APLs21 for school-based
management. These projects aimed to improve the

28. Through a series of APLs23 on Tertiary Education
Student Assistance, the Bank successfully supported
the Government’s strategy to foster the sustainable,
equitable, and efficient expansion of tertiary education

through the development of a coherent student assistance system consisting of grant programs and compensatory interventions for disadvantaged students.
The share of 18- to 24-year-old students in tertiary
education from households classified at the two lowest
quintiles of the income distribution increased from
(an adjusted baseline) 10 percent in 2004-05 to 20.6
percent in 2011, surpassing the project target of 20
percent for 2011. IFC also successfully supported: (a)
Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara (UAG) for the
construction and renovation of its facilities; (b) work
with Finem, the leading student loan institution; and
(c) support to Edilar, a company that gives access to
public school teachers to education-related products
and content, as well as to lending of resources for
continuing education. IFC’s education projects have
supported 29,000 students, of which 40 percent were
female. These projects also supported the creation
of over 4,000 jobs. [The expected outcome was
“achieved”.]

Improved Human Skills, Infrastructure,
Links Between Local and Global
Companies, Financing and Legal and
Regulatory Framework for IT
29. As part of its engagement to improve competitiveness, the WBG supported improvements in the business
environment, particularly among SMEs, and fostered
the innovative capacity of the private sector, including
research and development, to enhance productivity and
economic growth. The World Bank’s Doing Business
reports provided critical reform benchmarks within
Mexico, generating internal discussion and policy
reforms. Efforts to strengthen the innovative capacity
of the private sector and increasing the integration of
Mexico’s innovation system were supported by a DPL.
Although the number of agreements to streamline
public procurements procedures fell short of the DPL
target, the project was successful in mobilizing annual
private investment in infrastructure. Eventually, the
impact of the 2007 World Bank Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) helped Mexico modernize
its procurement systems by eliminating obsolete regulations and building in methods for transparency. The
Bank has successfully provided support to improve
human skills, infrastructure, links between local and
global companies, and the financial, legal, and regulatory framework for IT with support of an APL24 on
Innovation for Competitiveness and an ongoing project
on IT development (PROSOFT). As a result of these
projects, the number of companies with technical
capacity, quality standard certifications, and access to
new markets increased to 413 in 2012 (well above the
390 target for 2014). Total private R&D also increased
from 0.15 in 2004 to 0.17 percent in 2009 but below
the 0.23 percent target (2009). [The outcome was
“partially achieved”.]

C. Thematic Area III:
Promoting Social Inclusion
30. At the time of the CPS FY08-13 discussion, poverty
levels in Mexico had been declining since the crisis of
the mid-1990s; this thematic area focused on long-term
issues. Yet, the impact of the crisis in 2008 and the
AH1N1 influenza epidemic changed the Bank’s approach
in responding to expeditious demands from the Government to protect the poor’s investment in human capital
and their consumption. Outcomes supported by the Bank
to promote social inclusion included: (a) increased capacities in health, nutrition and education of poor families
through human capital investment; (b) preservation and
expansion of the Popular Health Insurance coverage of
poor and informal worker families; (c) improved access
to ECD services and learning outcomes of children in the
most marginalized municipalities; and (d) strengthening
the capacity of the health system to control epidemic
waves.

Increase Capacities in Health, Nutrition, and
Education of Poor Families Through Human
Capital Investment by Promoting Regular
Health Check-ups, Improving Health Status,
and Raising School Enrollment and Attendance
31. Bank assistance to increase health, nutrition, and
education outcomes of poor families helped sustain the
number of families and children participating in the
Oportunidades program. A loan and additional financing
(AF) associated with this conditional cash transfer (CCT)
program contributed to achieving significant development
results, with 5.8 million families participating in the
program as of December 2012 and another 3 million
more children participating in the program. The Bank
also provided extensive technical and convening services
to address a series of second-generation issues for the
Oportunidades program to be supported in the next CPS,
and contributed to increasing Mexico’s engagement in
South-South knowledge exchanges with other developing
countries. As a result, Oportunidades received numerous
delegations from other countries, most of which have
been organized by the Bank, where participants learned
of the design and implementation of social programs in
Mexico and exchanged different perspectives on poverty
alleviation programs. [The expected outcome was
“achieved”.]

Preserve and Expand the Popular Health
Insurance’s Coverage of Poor and Informal
Worker Families, and to Strengthen its
Financing and Affiliation Systems

for the poor by increasing popular health insurance
(PHI) coverage to virtually all intended beneficiaries.
Knowledge activities provided policy options. Compared with 27 million PHI affiliates at the beginning
of the CPS period, now there are more than 52 million
affiliates; virtually all intended beneficiaries of the
PHI are covered. The Basic Health Care Project
contributed to increase the number of health facilities
to guarantee the provision of services to affiliates who
qualify for the subsidized regime of the PHI. The Bank
also supported a Global Knowledge Exchange Activity
on Health Financing, as well as several South-South
exchanges that allowed the Government to share its
experience and learn from other health insurance
coverage programs. [The expected outcome was
“achieved”.]

Improve Access to ECD Services and
Learning Outcomes of Children in the Most
Marginalized Municipalities of Mexico
33. With the support of the Compensatory Education
Project, the Bank aimed to improve the access to
ECD services through several innovative interventions. The number of children attending at least 80
percent of ECD sessions grew by 30 percent between
2010 and 2013, and the number of parents attending
these sessions increased from 38,620 in 2009 to
49,447 in 2012, exceeding the end of year target.
Several knowledge products — with the support of
grant funding — contributed to improve access to
ECD services.25 [The expected outcome was
“achieved”.]

Strengthen the Capacity of the Mexican
Health System to Control Epidemic Waves

34. The Influenza and Prevention Control Loan was
cancelled due to problems using planned retroactive
financing26 and a milder than expected AH1N1
epidemic. Nonetheless, the World Bank supported
a number of Government decisions and actions that
contributed to containing the epidemic. Despite
the absence of Bank disbursements, the Ministry of
Health made significant progress toward the original
loan-identified program development objectives:
strengthening the capacity of the health system to monitor the spread of influenza viruses; and controlling
epidemic waves. By December 2010, 24 percent of
the population had been vaccinated against AH1N1,
and the Government had purchased more than 2.1
million units of antiviral medicines to replenish and
expand the country’s strategic reserves.27 As part of
its ongoing collaboration with the health sector, the
World Bank also provided technical assistance that
contributed to strengthening the National System for
Epidemiological Surveillance (SINAVE). The Bank

also supported the Government through an Avian and
Human Influenza (AHIF) grant in the development of
comprehensive risk communication strategies at the
local level in 9 states.28 The Bank helped in transferring knowledge from the Mexican experience with the
AH1N1 epidemic, including pandemic preparedness
management, and in showcasing Mexico’s best practice to Asian countries.
35. IFC strengthened its private health sector strategy through the financing of three projects: Centro
Medico Puertas de Hierro in the construction of
new hospitals in Guadalajara, Nayarit (frontier state),
and Colima, offering general primary, secondary, and
tertiary health services. These hospitals have already
reached 492,000 patients, showing strong demand for
their services. Additionally, in FY13 IFC supported
the creation of a new greenfield hospital within the
integrated medical complex in northern Monterrey
characterized by its growing low-and middle-income
population where demand for medical infrastructure is growing quickly. This hospital is planning
to reach 27,000 patients. Lastly, IFC successfully
structured and implemented a PPP solution for the
design, construction, financing, and operation of
two new regional secondary hospitals in Toluca and
Tlalnepantla (both in Estado de Mexico). This was
the first PPP hospital in Mexico to include a payment
mechanism incorporating deductions attached to contractually agreed-upon key performance indicators.
This has resulted in these hospitals being considered
among the most efficient healthcare facilities in the
country. [The expected outcome was “partially
achieved”.]

D. Thematic Area IV:
Developing Infrastructure and
Assuring Energy Security and
Environmental Sustainability
36. Despite an appropriate level of service coverage
in a wide variety of sectors— urban development,
transport, energy, water, environmental management — relative to the rest of Latin America, the
quality and reliability of these services in Mexico are
generally below what could be expected in an upper
middle-income country.29 Outcomes supported by the
Bank to promote this area included: (a) enhancing
massive urban public transport; (b) use of clean development mechanisms to foster technology, regulatory,
and institutional changes; (c) improving the federal
housing system; (d) improving water supply and sanitation service provision; (e) providing environmental
services; (f) integrating energy services in rural areas;
(g) contributing to low emissions in the energy sector;
(h) piloting renewable energy production; and (i) promoting adaptation to climate change.

Development of Urban Transport Evaluating
Alternative Solutions and Proposing
Frameworks for Private Sector Participation

Improve Federal Housing System to
Facilitate Access to Housing by Lowand Moderate- Income Families

37. The Government, together with the World Bank,
has been working to address public transport and air
pollution issues and their linkage to climate change.
Through a reimbursable advisory service (RAS),
the Bank advised on designing a federal program to
support the development of urban public transport
systems (i.e., PROTRAM). The Urban Transport
Transformation Project (UTTP) supports PROTRAM
to transform urban transport in Mexican cities onto
a lower-carbon growth path. The Sustainable Transport and Air Quality Program GEF grant, linked to
the UTTP, assisted municipalities in reducing CO2
emissions and supports policy changes to favor
larger investments in sustainable transport projects.
The ongoing Insurgentes Bus Rapid Transit System
Carbon Finance Project has contributed to reducing
airborne pollutants and GHG emissions generated
by the transport sector in Mexico City. This corridor
improved bus system energy efficiency by replacing
368 old, small, and mid-size gasoline and gas —
mainly liquid petroleum gas — units with 105 articulated passenger diesel buses. Emissions reductions
in the period Nov. 1, 2009, to Oct. 31, 2010 were
50,180 tons CO 2 per year, of which modal change
were 38,790 tons. 30 [The expected outcome was
“achieved”.]

39. At the initial stages of the global financial crisis, the
Government recognized the need to strengthen the Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF), a public sector institution
with the mandate to develop housing finance markets and
facilitate access to housing by low- and moderate-income
families. The Bank supported the Government toward
the achievement of this outcome through the Affordable
Housing and Urban Poverty Reduction DPL III (HUSAL)
and the Private Housing Finance Markets Strengthening
Project. However, the expected gradual expansion of SHF
products toward lower-income segments did not materialize because the agency’s focus shifted to mitigating
the mounting crisis of the housing sector in general. On
the positive side, the Private Housing Finance Project
successfully contributed to stabilizing the housing market
during the crisis by supporting government’s achievement
of 1 million housing solutions per year in 2008-12 and
strong SHF support to the private sector. Complementing
the HUSAL, a three-year Technical Assistance Loan
(HUTAL) supported technical aspects of the reforms
supported by the HUSAL. The HUSAL supported the
preparation and implementation of Mexico’s 2007-12
National Housing Program, but was not fully effective in
improving the complex institutional housing framework in
Mexico.

Catalytic Use of Clean Development
Mechanism to Foster Technology,
Regulatory and Institutional Changes
in the Public Transport Sector
38. Among the actions seeking to improve the use of
clean development mechanisms and foster technological and institutional changes in the energy and public
transport sectors, the Bank supported the Government
with the Green Growth DPL in developing the regulatory, monitoring, and financial framework for lower GHG
emissions.31 In parallel to this DPL, other operations
aimed to develop the regulatory and business framework of the transport sector. The introduction of Climate
Friendly Measures in Transport supported the design of
the BRT corridors in Mexico City (Metrobus) and the
creation of the institutional, regulatory, and business
framework for operating BRT systems in other Mexican
cities. Metrobus has now become a more robust agency
in technical terms and is mobilizing 800,000 passengers per day. The ‘Insurgentes Bus Rapid Transit
System Carbon Finance’ project has also contributed
to improve bus productivity by serving more passengers with lesser number of units and increase modal
share of large buses. [The expected outcome was
“achieved”.]

40. IFC incorporated in its strategy the support to the
housing sector based on the Government’s longstanding
agenda in promoting affordable housing. Before the 200809 crisis, IFC supported the demand side through equity
investments and debt financing in non-bank financial institutions (Su Casita, Vertice, GMAC), which made loans
to the low-income mortgage sector. From the supply side,
IFC supported large publicly listed homebuilders that
have the scale and capacity to provide the largest volumes
of affordable housing in the industry. At the end of FY13,
IFC had a portfolio totaling US$175 million exposure (net
of equity write downs) in the sector with Urbi, Homex, and
Alpha Geo. However, due to changes in government policy in 2012,32 the three largest homebuilders are currently
experiencing a liquidity crisis and are in the process of
restructuring. Nevertheless, the IFC portfolio includes
projects with clients that, to date, have not been affected
to the degree experienced by large homebuilders. [The
expected outcome was “partially achieved”.]

management of water resources. The Modernization of
the Water and Sanitation Sector TA (PATME) supported
the documentation and dissemination of successful water
models in 10 water utilities participating in this program.
Manuals developed by CONAGUA were distributed to
water utilities and water and sanitation sector institutions
beyond the realm of PATME. A satisfactory degree of
improvement was observed in operational and financial
performance of water utilities that were part of the
PATME. Through the successful rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure and the adoption
of improved farm irrigation and application systems, the
Integrated Irrigation and Modernization Project, together
with several knowledge activities and convening services
on reducing overexploitation of aquifers, significantly
improved water use efficiency and generated replicable
models. In an effort to support selected Mexican states
to improve their provision of water supply and sanitation,
the Bank in addition worked with the State of Guanajuato
in the implementation of the Decentralized Infrastructure
Development Loan, which expanded access to water and
sanitation services. A Water Sector DPL had a significant
institutional impact, including the approval of a new Climate Change Law, greater focus on climate change in the
framework of water planning instruments and programs at
the federal level, and strengthening CONAGUA institutional framework and monitoring capacity.
42. IFC provided capacity advisory support to the
municipal water company (OPDM) during the design
and implementation of a wastewater recycling plant in
the municipality of Tlalnepantla. Additionally, in 2010
IFC invested in Water Capital, a leasing company that
provides energy efficiency, renewable energy, and supplyand demand-side water management solutions tailored
to the specific needs of its customers. [The expected
outcome was “achieved”.]

Provision of Environmental Services of
National and Global Significance and
Secure Long-Term Sustainability

PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR
THE UNITED

STATES

62

43. During this CPS period, the Bank supported the
Government in its efforts to promote sustainable production and consumption, prevent environment degradation,
and ensure long-term development opportunities. With
the support of the Environmental Services Project and a
GEF grant, the Bank aimed to enhance the provision of
significant environmental services and secure long-term
sustainability. The project had an important impact
in increasing hydrological, biodiversity conservation,
and hectares under contract; and carbon sequestration
services. A series of Environmental DPLs supported
environmental sustainability measures in the energy,
water, tourism, and forestry sectors. They helped support
congressional approval of the Energy Sector Reform
package that included two key pieces of legislation: a
law to promote the efficient use of energy and a law to

increase the use of renewable energy sources. During the
ENVDPL III, the Bank also provided technical assistance
to revise and update the Mexican Forest Fund. By the
end of 2009, 15 million ha. of forest under sustainable
forest management operations were financed by this fund.
IFC also made a US$10 million investment in Optima
Energia, an energy services company, to undertake energy savings projects for six hotels in Mexico. This project
will build the market for energy service companies and
set a new standard for energy efficiency in the country’s
hotel sector. By project completion, Optima Energia could
reduce GHG emissions by 7.3 tons of CO2 equivalent per
year.
44. The Bank also supported the conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity, with projects like the Mesoamerican Corridor GEF grant, aimed at mainstreaming
biodiversity criteria in public expenditure and supporting
private efforts to achieve reduced deforestation and
improved management of natural resources and biodiversity conservation in six biological corridors in southeast
Mexico. The National System of Protected Natural Areas
(SINAP) was also supported by the GEF and the Bank
through several grants. [The expected outcome was
“achieved”.]

Increase Access to Efficient and Sustainable
Integrated Energy Services in—Predominantly
Indigenous—Rural Areas of Mexico
45. In order to increase access to efficient and sustainable
integrated energy services in predominantly indigenous rural areas of Mexico, the Bank supported the Government’s
Rural Electrification Program through a combination of
investment operations and grants from the GEF. Nevertheless, both the Integrated Energy Services Project and the
Solar Thermal Project, (i.e., Agua Prieta II) showed limited
progress (and are still ongoing) due to a combination of
complex procurement processes and project implementation difficulties. [The expected outcome was “partially
achieved”.]

Regulatory, Monitoring and Financial
Framework for Low Emissions Evolution of
the Transport and Energy Sectors Developed
46. The Efficient Lighting and Appliances Project promoted Mexico’s efficient use of energy and the mitigation
of climate change by increasing the use of energy-efficient
technologies at the residential level. The project successfully promoted the development of a sustainable market
for energy-efficiency equipment among the large and
fast-growing energy end-use sectors for lighting, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Specifically, less consumption
of electricity favored the environment, as an emission
of about 865,000 tons of CO2 was avoided with the 22.9
million light bulbs that were changed during 2012.

47. Also, as part of the Bank’s support in the agriculture
area, the ongoing Sustainable Rural Development Project
seeks to contribute to the goals of the National Strategy
on Climate Change by reducing GHG emissions through
the adoption of emission-reduction technologies. By the
end of 2012, 770 small and medium-size agri-businesses
adopted environmental sustainable technologies resulting
in 600,000 tons of CO2 equivalent avoided (close to the
CPS original target of 919 SMEs and 770,000 tons of CO2
equivalent for 2013). A Policy and Human Resources
Development (PHRD) grant helped improve the Ministry
of Environment’s capacity to promote the use of clean
agro-environmentally friendly practices among producers.
48. IFC, through its Sustainable Business Advisory
(SBA) has worked with companies to adopt environmental,
social, and governance best practice, as well as cleaner
technologies that create a competitive edge. Additionally
several IFC investments have been focused on energy
efficiency projects (e.g., Calindra, the country’s main lime
producer) improved environmental footprint with the use
of forest biomass as an alternate fuel source. By project
completion, Calindra is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 97,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per year. [The
expected outcome was “partially achieved”.]

Reduce GHG (CO2) Emission Through the
Adoption of Emission-Reduction Technologies
49. The Bank is supporting two wind projects in Mexico:
Carbon Fund-financed La Venta II and the GEF-financed
La Venta III. La Venta II entered into commercial operation in 2007. After facing many hurdles, La Venta III (i.e.,
the wind power large-scale renewable energy development
project) started operations in October 2012 and has paved
the way for the development of wind energy in Mexico
since it was the first project of its kind to be launched
under the Independent Power Producer Scheme. Today
more than 1,300 megawatts capacity of wind power energy are in operation with decreased prices of wind energy.
In 2010 and 2011, IFC financed the first two private wind
power projects in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Oaxaca).
IFC advisory services have helped the Mexican Wind
Energy Association (AMDEE) and the Ministry of Energy
formulate a strategy to promote the development of the
wind energy sector.33 [The expected outcome was
‘achieved”.]

Promoting Adaptation to Climate Change
50. During the CPS period, Mexico demonstrated a strong
commitment to address the challenges of climate change
through concrete actions in the areas of institutionalizing
the agenda, adopting related policy incentives, and designing national strategies and programs that placed climate change at the heart of the country’s NDP. As a result,
this CPSCR reports a separate outcome — not originally

considered on the CPSPR Results Matrix — that captures
the Bank’s engagement with the Government on the promotion of adaptation to climate change.
51. The Climate Change DPL was the first operation
processed under this new assistance modality for
Mexico proposed under the FY08-13 CPS. The engagement and packaging model tailored knowledge and
convening services around a series of annual DPLs that
successfully supported the Government’s effort under
its National Climate Change Strategy to mainstream climate change consideration in public policy. Moreover,
a Low Carbon DPL in FY10 and a Social Resilience
to Climate Change DPL in FY12 supported Mexico’s
climate change agenda, including advisory support for
adaptation in low-income and vulnerable populations,
while committing to reduce GHG emissions.34 Further analysis on the social impacts of climate change
included a report that identified the key drivers of
socio-spatial differences in resilience and vulnerability
to climate change in Mexico. At the subnational level,
the broad range of Bank products, including grants,
knowledge, and convening services, was coordinated
through an ongoing Subnational Climate Change MoU
that provided technical assistance to five states in the
preparation of their climate change plans. Moreover, the
GEF on Adaptation of Climate Change Impacts on the
Coastal Wetlands in the Gulf of Mexico also contributed
to promote climate change adaptation.
52. As part of the CPS flexible design, in partnership
with PREM, Treasury, and the Disaster Risk Financing
and Insurance Program, the Bank also supported the
integration of disaster risk within Mexico’s broader fiscal
risk management strategy. The Bank worked in partnership with Mexico on the first and second multi-peril
catastrophe bond (MultiCat bond) and had an active
engagement in mainstreaming prevention and risk reduction strategies, as well as promoting disaster and risk
financing and insurance activities. [The outcome was
“achieved” and exceeded.]

E. Thematic Area V:
Strengthening Institutions
53. Institutional strengthening was a critical cross-cutting theme in Bank support in most sectors. CPS outcomes
supported included: (a) providing the public with information on the efficiency and effectiveness of government
organizations and program expenditures; (b) improving
the administration in selected municipal governments;
(c) improving customs processes and efficiency; (d)
strengthening of fiscal transparency, governance, and
accountability; (e) supporting judiciaries institutional
performance; (f) improving capacity building and communication practices, and (g) strengthening and modernizing
treasury management.

Rigorous, Timely, User-Friendly Information on
the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Government
Organizations and Program Expenditures
54. Although the World Bank supported the development of performance information indicators through a
combination of financial and knowledge instruments,
government demand for the ongoing Results-Based
Management and Budgeting Project changed, resulting
in a partial cancellation and a reduction of the project’s
scope. Nonetheless, the project has helped strengthen
the capacity of the Ministry of Finance (SHCP) to
use standardized performance information of priority
public programs during budget preparation. The Bank,
however, continued to provide support to different selected federal entities and departments in the review and
strengthening of their M&E system strategy, as well as
capacity-building activities in other public accounting
and oversight institutions. [The outcome was partially “achieved”.]

Improved Administration in Selected
Municipal Governments
55. With support of an IDF grant for the Creation of a
Municipal Management Public Observatory, the Bank
contributed to institutional building, strengthening of
social accountability, and administration improvement
in selected municipal governments. This was achieved
through the creation of an online platform, currently
under operation, which provides a virtual space to
exchange good practice and other valuable knowledge.
With the use of this public website, areas where local
governments could improve have been identified,
which has resulted in the development of improved
trainings for local public servants. [The outcome was
“achieved”.]

Improved Efficiency of Customs Processes

56. The Bank supported the Government in improving
the efficiency in customs processes through the Customs
Institutional Strengthening Project. This operation aimed
to reduce transaction costs, customs clearance time, and
a total redesign of processes, among others. The project,
approved in 2009, was cancelled 3 years later following
the request of the Government due to the lack of optimal
conditions to implement this project by the executing
agency (SAT). [The development outcome was “not
achieved”.]

Strengthened Fiscal Transparency,
Governance, and Accountability
57. The Bank supported fiscal transparency, governance,
and accountability by measuring the satisfaction of
Congress and civil society with performance information
available via a dedicated government website. Through
the support of the Results Based Management project,
an active network and portal is now available for citizens
since December 2012. The Institutional Strengthening of
Congress IDF grants I and II supported the development
and implementation of an integrated information management system to be used by Congress staff and members.
However, the creation of the monitoring and evaluation
system for Congressional performance and technical staff
was not accomplished for lack of internal buy-in given
changes of management. [The expected outcome was
“partially achieved”.]

Support the Improvement of Institutional
Performance of Judiciaries
58. Through the Judicial Modernization Project, the Bank
helped implement a new ICT network that provided timely
information on demand and supply of justice services in
the courts of the Federal District Government which was
the only subnational jurisdiction that signaled its interest
to access the existing credit line, as other states were
reluctant to participate given the lack of coordination
between the state governments and judiciaries. The new
network has increased the information available. As of
2010, annual statistics reports have been published and
disseminated. There is also an online bulletin providing
the status and location of cases in courts. However, only 5
applications were uploaded to the ICT institutional platform from the 10 targeted by the completion of the project.
[The expected outcome was “partially achieved”].

Improved Capacity Building and
Communication Practices
59. By strengthening the institutional capacities of
diverse federal and state agencies, the Bank helped
improve the availability of information through the implementation of different grants and knowledge services.
The IDF grant to support Federal Institute for Access
to Information (IFAI) in the adoption of the electronic
access to information system (INFOMEX) was successful
in expanding and making operational this system to all
31 states and to several autonomous entities that were
not initially considered. The National Agrarian Registry
(RAN) was also supported by the Bank through the Cadastral Information system IDF. Within the scope of this
grant, it was possible to strengthen RAN’s capacity to link
geographical and legal information and develop a sound
technological platform to integrate and analyze data. [The
expected outcome was “achieved”].

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP
PERFORMANCE
60. To fulfill the challenging needs and demands of a
complex middle-income country like Mexico, the Bank
successfully developed a thematic engagement model
to improve selectivity, effectiveness, and efficiency in
delivery in the context of limited IBRD capital. This
model reflects the transition to a more strategic and
integrated client engagement that seeks to maximize
the impact of the package of services (financial,
knowledge, and convening services) offered by the
WBG. Following the flexible design of the CPS, the
model also accounts for the WBG’s ability to respond
to client needs at federal and subnational levels. Based
on the success of the thematic model in the design
and implementation of a flexible country strategy, the
performance of the World Bank at implementing the
CPS FY08-13 has been rated as “satisfactory”. This
rating focuses on two key dimensions: (a) the design
of the strategy and (b) the implementation of the CPS
program.

A. CPS Design and Relevance
61. The design of the original strategy was based on
support on five engagement principles. The five country engagement principles are: (a) competitive IBRD
pricing with a base-level borrowing of US$800 million
per year; (b) flexibility in delivering emerging financial
services and on-time knowledge products; (c) selectivity
in areas of support by focusing on areas of comparative
advantage and exiting programs with lack of demand
or operational rigidities; (d) fast response in meeting
the Government’s changing demands with tailored
development solutions; and (e) enhanced coordination
within the WBG. These principles of engagement were
the result of client feedback and the Mexican authorities’ desire to maintain a strong relationship with the
Bank. To implement these principles and enhance its
delivery of knowledge services, the Bank proposed back
in 2008 to base its support on a streamline approach.
This approach anchored most lending in a large annual
DPL supporting Government’s national development
priorities, accompanied by an enhanced package of
non-lending services.
62. The implementation of these country engagement principles confirmed the relevance
of the strategy and its alignment with Mexico’s
development priorities; yet, the flexibility of
the design made possible a timely and effective
response by WBG to the changing needs of the
country given the deteriorating international
economic environment. The strategy took into
account the need to adjust the program to Mexico’s
changing circumstances and priorities as a result of the

global economic downturn as well as the food crisis and
the influenza pandemic. The Bank was able to rapidly
align its strategy to the Government’s 10 Point Program,
which highlighted the countries immediate priorities
under the NDP at the time of the crisis. During this
crisis period, the Bank also effectively responded by
reducing its average time of preparation for DPLs to
5 months in comparison to the 18 months experienced
during the past CPS. The CPS was able to identify all
critical risks and mitigation measures following the
global crisis. None of them affected the implementation
of the country’s portfolio. The CPS Results Matrix was
updated during the CPSPR and then again with this
CPSCR in order to include outcomes that were not
originally considered. Most outcome indicators were
relevant for ongoing CPS objective; and where new or
better indicators were available (in four cases), they
were used in the assessment. The CPSPR also mapped
IFC’s strategic realignment to support the gradual
recuperation of the economy by strengthening the financial sector, supporting investment in infrastructure
and climate change, and helping competitive industries
with a special focus on sectors with importance for
employment generation such as SMEs. It maintained
IFC’s pro-active portfolio management, while showing
selectivity in its approach to new business to ensure
high additionality and development impact.
63. A rolling business plan where all WBG financial, knowledge, and convening products and packages were accounted for in real time (at entry and
exit) helped in maintaining program monitoring
and a degree of selectivity. The constant monitoring
of the business plan confirmed the effective selection of
areas of engagement and instruments, and helped assess
the realism of the expected outcomes and the quality of
the results framework. Business plans were also used
to communicate World Bank program engagement with
central and sector ministries, development partners, and
the media.

B. Implementing the Strategy
64. The Bank has been highly successful in mobilizing resources and leveraging co-financing of other
organizations and donors to enhance the effectiveness
of the overall support provided to the country. The
Bank has focused its efforts in developing partnerships and financing packages in areas of common interest, particularly with other financial international
institutions (e.g., IMF, IADB), civil society (e.g.,
Transparency International), bilaterals (e.g., Agence
Française de Développement, AFD), the private sector/foundations, and the financial markets. One relevant example is co-financing of the Oportunidades
program with the IADB. IFC also mobilized US$790
million from other private sector partners in the CPS
period.

65. The results-based thematic engagement
approach implemented during the CPS period,
particularly in regard to human capital mobilization, was highly effective in keeping strong client
dialogue and business relations with the private and
public sectors in critical areas where the WBG had
comparative advantages and was also learning from
Mexico’s experience. In particular, the business model
of having sector leaders in large country offices was highly
effective; these sector leaders are technically and operationally strong to provide inputs to sector management
and capture knowledge as programs are implemented.
Decentralized sector leaders are able to develop coordination focal points and integrate sector agendas with
sector ministries, country partners, and stakeholders,
while representing sector business planning with country
management units.
66. Financial services took on an increasingly important role not only in crisis response but also in
advancing Mexico’s leading role in the use of innovative financial solutions. At the federal level, Mexico
took advantage of the embedded flexibility of IBRD loans
to fix the interest rates on their loans. The Government
also signed a master derivatives agreement with the Bank,
enabling them to use IBRD hedging products to manage
market risk of their overall debt portfolio. Moreover, the
implementation of customized solutions provided competitive funding for subnational entities, allowing the Bank
to continue its developmental work with these entities.
IFC also committed US$580 million to Mexico’s financial
sector, with volumes increasing in the latter part of the
period.

67. Moving forward after the crisis, the Bank
adopted a results-based thematic engagement approach seeking to maximize the impact of Bank’s
support in a complex middle-income country.
The Bank implemented results-based programmatic
knowledge services together with reimbursable advisory
services (RAS). This model results in an emphasis
on the synergies and linkages between the various
activities that help achieve strategic objectives related to the theme, and not just on a set of stand-alone
deliverables unconnected to each other. The activities
and the associated results framework cover a two- to
three-year time horizon. Dissemination and client
feedback are an inherent part of this instrument now
known as “programmatic approach”. At the same time,
IFC advisory services had 24 active knowledge projects
in Mexico across several business lines with 72 percent
of them closing in the period rated successful or higher.
Following client’s needs, the Bank also provided RAS
products more strategically and packaged these services
within the overall CPS knowledge agenda. Since 2008,
there has been a steady demand of the provision of RAS
to the Government (three per year on average), which is
indicative of the client’s appreciation for the breadth and
depth of international experience that the Bank brings

to complex development solutions. Mexico is among the
largest RAS users in the Bank.
68. The implementation of the program entailed
close supervision and periodic reviews of the
portfolio both at the project and country level.
To tackle implementation issues, several CPPRs were
held with the active participation of the Government
and the Bank’s team. At the CPPRs, projects at risk of
not achieving their development objectives and projects
with slow disbursements were at the center of CMU and
sector quality reviews. As a result of these discussions,
action plans were agreed with government counterparts,
including restructurings and partial cancellations, and
strong monitoring and follow-through have ensured a
healthy loan portfolio in the context of complex operational engagements in the energy and transport sectors.
In addition to CPPRs, the CMU provided to government
counterparts — through the Business Plan — with regular updates of its list of activities that classified all WBG
activities by theme and type of instrument. This helped
government to coordinate joint portfolio improvement
efforts. Mexico’s fiduciary and safeguards framework is
strong, and the Bank is adopting more frequently Mexico’s country systems in the implementation of its own
projects. Harmonization of fiduciary procedures among
other multilaterals and the supreme audit institution,
through a memorandum of understanding, contributed to
streamlined financial reporting.
69. A new communication strategy was successfully
implemented to promote a new narrative around
development impact of thematic multi-year engagements. First, opportunities were identified and prioritized
to showcase the tailored suite of WBG services:
a. A new corporate narrative was used by
senior management (e.g., in presentations,
papers, OpEds) and in communication outreach (e.g., public presentations, brochures,
websites).
b. Reputational risk management systems
were established through social media
monitoring.
c. Regional and corporate advocacy campaigns were implemented (e.g., World
Development Report, LCR Flagship Middle
Class, #whatwillittake campaign).
Second, internal and external knowledge sharing
was promoted (e.g., participation in Mexico book
fairs in 3 major cities – Monterrey, Guadalajara, and
Mexico City – reaching more than 10,000 visitors).
Finally, a web and online social media strategy was
implemented and key partnerships were developed and
consolidated. For example, between 2012 and 2013,
there was an impressive increase in the number of

web-based stories and public presentations displaying
multi-year development solutions. During FY12, the
number of web-based stores was almost zero (2 per
year). By the third quarter of FY13, 114 stories and
public presentations were produced. The procurement
reform results story, for instance, was published in the
Bank’s results story compendium and won a Regional
award.

to 4.1 years in FY13 with the extension of several energy
and GEF projects. Since 2008, IEG has evaluated 22
projects of which 64 percent have been rated between
“satisfactory” and “moderately satisfactory”. Regarding
quality at entry, 50 percent of these 22 projects were
rated between “moderately satisfactory” and “highly
satisfactory”, while 77 percent were rated in this same
range for quality at supervision. Average of projects at
risk has remained in 4 projects per year and involved
complex innovative energy projects with procurement
issues that needed to be restructured. Efforts to further
increase implementation have focused on the gradual
adoption of country systems.

70. Mexico continues to be among the Bank’s
largest borrowers. The country is currently the largest
IBRD borrower with US$14.78 billion outstanding debt
as of September 30, 2013, representing some 10 percent
of the IBRD total portfolio. As of June 30, 2013, the
active portfolio consisted of 13 IBRD projects and 5 full
GEF operations for a net commitment of US$4,557.8 million of which 34 percent remained undisbursed (Table
2). The number of projects under implementation has
remained in the range of 18-23 operations throughout the
CPS period. The average age of IBRD projects dropped
from 4 years in FY08 to 3 years in FY12, but increased

71. In FY13, IFC committed portfolio in Mexico reached
US$1,584 million, of which US$940 million is outstanding (disbursed) (Table 3). The portfolio consists of 54
different clients in more than 14 industries. Disbursement
rates have increased in the past two fiscal years above
the FY08-11 average, reaching US$902 million in FY13.

also improving: although the percentage of projects rated
successful in the CPS period is below the IFC average;
FY13 results were rated 81 percent successful or higher.
For IFC as a whole, Mexico ranks number 7 of the 138
countries representing 3 percent of IFC total portfolio as
of end-June 2013.

V. LESSONS LEARNED
AND RECOMMENDATIONS
72. The FY08-13 CPS was designed to be flexible
and innovative in responding to Mexico’s development needs. This flexibility allowed the Bank to respond
expeditiously to the Government’s requests when the global economic downturn hit the country. The implementation
of Mexico’s past country strategies reflect a transition to a
more strategic and integrated client engagement maximizing the package of services offered by the WBG. The CPS
was able to improve alignment, operational efficiency, and
impact through the use of more focused interventions and
programmatic knowledge approaches, greater wholesaling
resource and budget mobilization, real-time learning and
adaptation, and exit of program areas where value added,
comparative advantage, and impact was no longer aligned
with the evolving program.
73. Results framework and flexibility. At the time of
the progress report the results framework was adjusted to
reflect the more selective approach that was adopted in
the meantime and to identify improved quantitative indicators. Corporate requirements at the time asked for only
one progress report, leaving little flexibility for additional
adjustments. Therefore, when for example the climate
change agenda emerged in the strategic agenda with the
client, it could only be included as a separate outcome at
the time of this completion report. The changed corporate
guidelines for CAS products now allow more flexibility to
adjust the program at several points during implementation, and the next CPS should take advantage of it.

PARTNERSHIP

74. Working with subnational clients. A MoU with
the State of Oaxaca proved to be a successful strategy to
support the poorest states or regions of Mexico. The MoU
itself is not designed to be restrictive, with the nature of
objectives, instruments included, and level of formality
dependent upon the level of depth of engagement. The
MoU has also served to deepen dialogue, monitor implementation, and assess impact within the framework
of a programmatic engagement. Hence, the Bank shall
continue to close the knowledge gap by working at the
subnational level to support poor states in Mexico following the experience thus far in supporting the State of
Oaxaca Annex 3 contains a short summary of the Oaxaca
MOU and result of the partnership.

75. Continued support of Mexico’s role as a global
knowledge leader. As an innovative middle-income
country, Mexico has increased its engagement in learning
with other developing countries across a wide variety of
subject areas. During the previous CPS period, Mexico
engaged in approximately 33 knowledge exchanges, and
the country is widely recognized as a global player on environmental sustainability and a pioneer among developing
countries in climate change policy and negotiations. The
WBG should thus continue supporting the Government
in exchanging knowledge with other countries. There is a
strong potential for global knowledge brokering with the
Bank as the global connector.
76. Exposure limits. With the Government being so
close to the single borrower limit, it is advisable to agree
with our counterparts on a very selective package of financial, knowledge and convening services with customized
results-focused development solutions in areas where the
Bank can provide value added. In this context, it would
also be important for the WBG to continue with its efforts
in leveraging resources from the WBG and other development partners in support of the Government’s program.
77. Bank-IFC-MIGA cooperation. Bank-IFC cooperation on specific areas around their core competencies
should improve effectiveness. Strategic coordination in
the implementation of complementary interventions by
the Bank and IFC is critical in achieving common goals
in areas such as improving competitiveness and business
climate, access to financial markets, and infrastructure
development activities. MIGA engagement with Mexico
is emerging, and IBRD and IFC would work closely to
support MIGA’s successful in-country transition.
78. Lending instruments. During crisis periods, the
use of the additional financing instrument proved simpler,
faster, and more cost-effective for the borrower, compared
to other lending tools. Budget support loans (DPLs) can
pave the way for many other Bank-financed operations;
and in turn, those operations enrich the dialogue to develop further sequenced DPLs. Also, during the economic
crisis, DPLs proved to be effective tools in sustaining
progress and protecting long-term reform agendas in the
face of negative external shocks. Multi-sector SWAP operations may not be practical in the Mexico context since
they require significant effort to design and supervise and
potentially dilute the Bank’s ability to provide just-in-time
policy advice and technical assistance.
79. GAC. Although anti-corruption measures aim to
limit exposure to fraud and corruption risks in MIC
countries with strong fiduciary frameworks, these same
measures limit the flexibility to quickly prepare and
disburse operations. Particularly in emergency situations,
there is room for further work to find balance in the way
the Bank engages on corruption issues.
80. Knowledge services. Trust fund resources were

indispensable for providing technical assistance to advance the government reform program and to strengthen
coordination among key stakeholders. In addition, grant
resources were very important to finance aspects of
studies that may be overlooked, especially in areas of environmental and social concerns. Reimbursable advisory
services can be a powerful instrument, but the Bank could
avoid over specifying procedures. The Bank is working
to have one negotiated standard reimbursable contract,
which should facilitate negotiations. Programmatic
approaches proved to be remarkable instruments in the
focalization and prioritization of Bank’s interventions in
Mexico. In general, further dissemination is required to
spread the findings of several Bank studies to the local
level. This is very important since many issues to be
solved require changes at the subnational level.

As part of the reform process supported by the Bank, an originally proposed 2 percent
consumption tax was substituted by a 1 percent increase in the general VAT rate. Minor
modifications were also introduced to the proposal for the enhancement of the income
tax regime, while an excise tax on beer increase and the newly introduced excise tax
on telecommunications were adjusted downward. These modifications contributed to
moderating the increase in non-oil tax revenue as a percent of GDP from 9.5 percent
in 2009 to 10.0 percent in 2010, instead of the 10.8 percent under the administration’s
initial proposal. Despite a more modest outcome, the non-oil tax revenue continued
to increase from an average of 8.7 percent of GDP during the previous administration
(2001-2006) to 9.5 percent during the first half of the 2007-2012 administration.

As a result of a fiscal reform that was approved on October 31, 2013, the Mexican
Ministry of Finance expects to raise non-oil tax income from 9.9 percent in 2013 to
10.3 percent in 2014 (source Criterios Generales de Política Económica 2014).
As part of the reform process supported by the Bank, it is important to notice
that programmable spending increased from 18.2 percent of GDP in 2008 to 19.9
percent in 2010 (more than the 18.7 percent anticipated in the DPL, but down from
20.5 percent observed in 2009, partly explained by the strong recovery in 2010); and
the public sector borrowing requirements increased from 1.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to
3.4 percent in 2010 (slightly more than the 3.1 percent expected in the DPL). A program
of knowledge services built on the reform agenda of the DPL. A PKS in Fiscal Mgmt.
was successful in informing policymakers of the fiscal pressures Mexico could face,
contributing to the dialogue between the Bank and the gov’t on the fiscal reform.

Although non-oil tax revenue is expected to be 10.0 percent in 2013, and
decline thereafter based on the Mexico 2012 IMF Article IV Consultation (released
in November 2012), a fiscal reform is expected to be approved on October 31st,
2013. The positive changes of this reform are expected to be included in the
Mexico 2013 IMF Article IV Consultation (to be released in November 2013).

WBG Activities that contributed to the Outcome
The Bank can help assist with the construction of indicators and
monitor policy impact to provide an informed basis to adjust policies
to enhance development outcomes, particularly in fiscal areas.
A technical assistance effort focused on sector entity
improvement needs to be a medium-to-long term initiative,
ranging between 4-6 years, for it to produce solid institutions.
Government should allow for a longer lead time for the entities to
get certified and encompassed under a regulatory framework.
A technology platform is crucial to bring the sector entities together
as an inter-connected network of rural financial intermediaries.
In order to reach low-income households, where literacy rates
are low and functional literacy is practically nonexistent, efforts
need to be made in the area of social intermediation.
Where the sector consists of a large number of initially
poorly performing entities, which most likely need to be merged or
liquidated, the political ramifications emanating from liquidation
could easily jeopardize the sector consolidation process.
For projects that overlap over time and have similar objectives, they
would benefit from a holistic evaluation, rather than individual ones.
Several markets present the resistance of family owned companies
to opening their capital base. The problem should be considered
within an “ecosystem” where actions and regulations for each
segment of the ecosystem should be recommended.
Preparation for how to respond to a crisis –including the
analysis necessary to guide these responses– should
be done prior to the onset of a crisis.

The Economic Response DPL and a package of knowledge and convening services on agricultural trade supported Mexico’s efforts in reducing trade costs. The GoM reduced tariff rates
and increased the number of duty free tariff lines for imports from countries without trade
agreements or tariff preferences negotiated by Mexico, resulting in a simpler tariff structure.
The average general MFN tariff rate fell from 10.4 percent in 2008 to 5.3 percent in 2010,
and will be further reduced to 4.3 percent by the end of 2013. Based on IEG Reviews of Bank
operations (P112264 – ICR April 17, 2012): “Efficiency in trade sector policies is rated high”.

4. Improved competitiveness by lowering
international trade costs via reduction of
MFN tariffs and simplification of the trade
tariff regime and customs processes.

Baseline (2008): 10.4%
Target (2010): 5.3%
Actual (2010): 5.3%

Indicator: A reduction in the average tariff
for manufactured imports to 5.3 percent

In addition, several indicators were used to measure progress towards simplification
of tariff regime. The reduction in rates and increase in the number of duty free
tariff lines resulted in a simpler tariff structure. The number of duty free
tariff lines was increased from 20 percent in 2008 to 58.7 percent in 2010 and to
61 percent in 2011. The reforms supported by the Bank rationalized the borrower’s
tariff structure, reduced distortions, and simplified Mexico’s trade regime.
Regarding customs processes, the Government also implemented other reforms with
the active support of the World Bank Group aimed at reducing trade costs, facilitating
trade, and improving customs administration. Although the Mexico Customs Institutional
Strengthening Project (47396-MX) was cancelled (see outcome 25), the Bank supported
the creation of the Single Trade Window (STW) as part of the Strengthening the Business
Environment for Enhanced Economic Growth DPL (Report 58431-MX, December 15,
2010). The STW became operational for the 21 trade processes linked to the General
Customs Administration (part of SAT) in mid-January 2012. Moreover, the CATT improved
trade quality by promoting excellence in customs performance management.

Indicator: Beneficiaries hired under the temporary employment program over the 2009-2010

poverty diagnostics, policy papers, and micro-simulation exercises on the targeting of
social programs, poverty diagnostics, labor productivity for the poor, and female labor
force participation and the production of new labor productivity data in the services sector
(supported by the Spanish Trust Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean - SFLAC).

Achieved and Exceeded.
The number of beneficiaries hired through PET increased from 365,000 in 2008 to
897,000 thousand in 2010, surpassing the CPS outcome indicator. According to the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Review (P118070 - April, 2012): “The number of
beneficiaries and number of work shifts contracted through PET exceeded targets,
and both more than doubled. Efficacy in labor sector policies is rated substantial.”

WBG Activities that contributed to the Outcome

To make well informed decisions, the government should weight the
tradeoffs of policy options based on considerations such as cost,
sequential importance, technical difficulty, risks, and impact.
Policy options could promise greater benefits in the longer
run, others could be targeted for quick action.

It is important that more effort is exerted in improving the
quality of surveys and provisions should be made for the
linking of the survey data to administrative data.
The publishing of aggregate tabular data on reported gross income
and taxable income (by all sources and by type of tax payer) would
allow evidence-based adjustments to the ENIGH data (either through
the application of factors that vary across the income distribution
and by individual characteristics, or through re-weighting the data).
This would be a significant improvement on the status quo.
There is also need for significant research on the behavioral
response to taxation, both in terms of labor supply, and in
terms of the classical incidence of indirect taxes.
A labor reform bill was already put forth by the new administration. The
WB produced a package of policy briefs for the new government; among
them a note on labor issues that highlights the issue of productivity. The
ongoing work via several trust funds will be an important contribution to
efforts to collaborate with the new government on labor productivity.

Achieved.
The School Based Management I project contributed to increase the number of schools
participating in the Quality Schools Program (PEC) from 10.3 percent during 2006 to
20.35 percent in 2009. The percentage of poor schools located in highly marginalized and
marginalized areas participating in the PEC program also increased from 38.4 percent in
2010 to 44.5 percent in 2013 (the project is on track to meet the 55% outcome for 2014).

Achieved.
The series of APLs for School Based Management helped increase the number of basic education schools participating in the quality improvement program from 39,000 to over 50,000. By
end December 2012, the June 2014 targets on the percentage of PEC schools in marginalized
areas, as well as the percentage of indigenous schools participating in PEC, had nearly been
reached. As of June 2013, over 26 percent of all basic education schools are participating in
the PEC program, up from 20 percent in 2010. Several technical studies have been carried
out with Bank support to improve the performance of the School Quality Program (PEC).

WBG Activities that contributed to the Outcome

Several factors worked well for sustaining the project’s benefits over
time, and Mexico’s ability to continue to make progress in ensuring
that the poorest segments of its population have access to high
quality basic education, in an efficient manner: (i) the activities
supported by the project continue to be fully consistent with the
national education policy; (ii) CONAFE (implementing agency) is
a mature, strong institution, with well qualified staff, capable of
coordinating the implementation of a complex program efficiently.

Top-down solutions are often inefficient and do not work on the
ground. This was a central observation made during the School Based
Management project design, based on the international literature.
Targeting is complicated, given the multiple objectives
of the PEC and the political realities.
Creating legal autonomy does not automatically
lead to changes in school management.

Achieved.
Through a series of APLs on Tertiary Education Student Assistance, the number
of graduates from tertiary education in Mexico increased from 296,000 in 2003
to over 475,000 in 2009, and the share of 18 to 24 year-old students in tertiary
education from households from the two lowest quintiles rose from 5.5 percent in
2003 to more than 20 percent in 2011, well above the 8 percent target for 2009.
IFC successfully supported the UAG in the construction and renovation of its facilities.
Moreover, IFC worked with FINEM to expand its lending operations to provide loans
to students. With IFC investment, Edilar financed the sale of additional products to
public sector teachers, as well as the lending of resources for continuing education.

Achieved and Exceeded.
The Bank supported the Government through a series of Development Policy Loans (DPLs).
These DPLs supported the implementation of the Upper Secondary Education Reform. By
2011, 100 percent of federal schools implemented the competence-based curriculum,
well above the 50 percent target. Improvements in student learning can be seen by
ENLACE scores in Mathematics surpassing their targets, with 30.8 percent scoring good or
excellent in the test as compared to 15 percent at the start of the project, and improved
transition from lower secondary and completion rates for students from the poorest
quintile (from 57 percent to 62 percent and from 47 percent to 48 percent, respectively).

WBG Activities that contributed to the Outcome

When project finance is not additional, but rather a source of
financing for the overall fiscal budget, a clear understanding about
how budget for project-supported activities is provided is essential.
More care is needed to mitigate against the impact on
projects due to a change in administration (as happened with
respect to this project in 2006) that is often accompanied
by changes that reach far down into the executive.
In a sophisticated middle-income country like Mexico, it is
not possible to ring-fence a Bank-financed project from the
broader, more complex government program. In the case of this
project, as the size of the PRONABES program expanded, project
restructuring could have included a revision in the project financing
plan to include all government financing to PRONABES.

Implement a flexible research and policy analysis
program. Mexico has a strong policy research capacity and the
Subsecretaría de Educación Media Superior (SEMS) has been
proactive in developing a robust program and evaluation.
The Bank’s role should focus on providing particular inputs into
policy research as opposed to leading the research agenda.
Further dissemination is needed to spread the findings of the Mexican
Alliance for Education Quality Study to the local level. This is important
since the upper secondary level requires reform at the local level.

WBG Activities that contributed to the Outcome

The Information Technology project was designed with
strong private sector participation. The government’s
role would thus be limited to the PPP concept design
and promotion and also contributing minimum public
funds to mitigate risks for private sector investments.
The availability of a talent pool that is conversant with
English language is one of the key drivers of investments
in the IT/ITES sector. It was necessary then to include a
component of English language training in the project.
A DPL approach was rejected on the information
technology side because there are no major reforms
required to remove bottlenecks in the IT sector and
reforms in other sectors (i.e. Education) could not
be implemented in practice in the short-term.

WBG Activities that contributed to the Outcome

In highly decentralized systems, there is a need for comprehensive health
sector reforms to be implemented successfully at the local level.
The introduction of health insurance can yield major improvements
in the performance of a health system, but the full potential
impact will only be realized if beneficiaries are empowered.

The Bank played an important and effective role during the
crisis supporting social Protection Programs. According to an
analysis done by CONEVAL, extreme poverty levels would have
been even higher, particularly in rural areas, in the absence
of social protection programs such as Oportunidades.
The additional financing instrument became the best
mechanism to continue Bank’s support to Oportunidades. The
use of the AF was simpler, faster, and more cost-effective
for the borrower, compared to other lending tools.
CCT programs cannot be thought of in isolation from other social
policies. In particular, achieving the human capital accumulation goals
sought by CCT programs will typically require adaptation of the supply
of social services, including expanding coverage and improving quality.
CCT programs will not be able to break the intergenerational
transmission of poverty if there are no jobs or adequate livelihoods
available when assisted children become earners in their own right.

Efficacy of the emergency instrument in health emergencies.
Consistency of emergency policies with other fiduciary policies.
GAC policy and its application under emergency situations.
Different nature of emergencies requires different
responses; non-incremental financing incentives.
High-risk groups can only be reached through an intense
communication effort. In order to reach specific high-risk population groups, it is necessary to make adjustments based
on their specific characteristics and conditions.
The grant process in emergency situations is slower than
one would expect given the systems in place for grant
management and the Federal nature of the country.
There is a need to review Mexico’s financial and administrative
system so as to speed up the implementation of grants.
PKS’s proved to be a very flexible instrument. They enabled the
Bank to respond quickly to unexpected emergency situations.

An APL is a useful instrument to support implementation
of a government program where a long-term involvement
may be necessary to produce expected outcomes.
When designing projects and corresponding Bank loans with both relatively fast disbursing components and slower technical assistance type
activities, it is desirable to build in mechanisms that pace the disbursements of fast disbursing components to progress in the implementation
of technical assistance for institutional strengthening type activities.
Care is needed in the design of a project’s monitoring framework

A DPL can pave the way for many other Bank-financed operations, and
in turn, those operations enrich the dialogue to develop the DPL.
It is difficult to overcome political differences between the Federal
District’s and the State of Mexico’s administrations. The metropolitan
character of some of the projects (i.e. Mexico City metropolitan
area) and the involvement of the State of Mexico, which shares the
same transport and air quality related problems, was limited.
Development of transport baseline methodologies needs to be further
encouraged. Similarly, further field testing of bus technologies is
needed for defining emission standards and for the decision-making
process on alternative bus technologies for public transport.
Introduction of new bus technologies and low carbon fuels needs to
be encouraged to form a larger share of the modal and fuel mix.

The main drawback for safeguards implementation in
the transport sector is the lack of environmental and
social capacity within Mexico’s financing intermediary that
functions as the counterpart of the Bank (i.e. BANOBRAS).

WBG Activities that contributed to the Outcome

Both sector wide assistance and institutional development
remain elusive for MICs. HUTAL’s attempt to implement
sector-wide reform by assigning simultaneous (and
complementary) tasks and technical assistance
funding to various implementing agencies proved
frustrating for its failure to foster agreement even on
a strategy for unification, let alone sector unification
itself, and costly for increasing supervision costs.

In general terms, Technical Assistance Lending has limited
benefits in a MIC environment. Traditionally TALs offer
a means of supporting nascent and weak institutions
and of preparing for investment operations. In a MIC,
however, the costs of setting up and operating public
institutions are covered by existing government revenue.

Contrary to down-market aims, establishing a sound
reputation in financial markets and sustaining a
high quality and expanding portfolio can lead a
new mortgage financier up-market, by targeting
higher income borrowers with larger loans.

In large and sophisticated middle-income countries
like Mexico, an operation should avoid promising
sector-wide reforms when commensurate results cannot
be realistically achieved in the short timeframe and with
the relatively modest scale of assistance offered.

There are tradeoffs between ambitious and comprehensive
sectoral reform programs, which are potentially more
beneficial, but inherently more risky, and more focused
programs that address a limited range of issues for
which both the potential benefits and risks are lower.

WBG Activities that contributed to the Outcome

For modernization of irrigation projects in Mexico aiming to have impacts
on increased agricultural competitiveness, it is necessary to establish a
common strategy between institutions such as SAGARPA and CONAGUA
that forces them to setup a joint M&E system and report on the same
indicators – not only in terms of number of hectares with modernized
systems and improved irrigation technologies, but also on indicators of
agriculture productivity, labor generated, areas under high-value crops.

It is necessary to distinguish form from substance. Most of the innovation
(OBD, SWAP, National Program, and Country Systems) included in
some of the water sector DPLs were internal Bank preoccupations
barely understood by the client at the state and municipal levels.

Multi-sector SWAP operations may not be practical. This requires
significant effort to design and supervise, and potentially dilute the
Bank’s ability to provide good policy advice and technical assistance.

Direct IBRD-support for infrastructure at the subnational level in Mexico
is both feasible and important. However, a new paradigm for delivering
this type of support needs to be formulated to be more efficient.

Trust Fund resources were indispensable for providing

Development of robust monitoring and evaluation is
important for the credibility of PES programs. The credibility
of environmental services programs relies not only on
fiduciary monitoring but also mainly on quantification
of the actual impacts of environmental services.
Although the Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales
Protegidas (CONANP) has put in place processes
for measuring outcomes, it does not have the
ability to address threats since this requires strong
coordination with other Government agencies that
are often understaffed and underfunded.
The energy invested in the evaluation of
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) not only
pays dividends in avoiding environmental impacts

Municipalities, undertook a systematic social assessment that included:

Partially Achieved.
The Bank supported the Government’s rural electrification program through a
combination of investment operations and grants from the Global Environment
Facility (GEF). Both projects, however, showed limited progress due to a
combination of complex procurement processes and project implementation
difficulties. By the end of the CPS period, the number of households electrified
with solar photovoltaic technology had not increased, given that the solar farms
had not yet started to operate. After a restructuring of the project, including
a one-year extension of the closing date (to June 2014) and a simplification
of the project’s implementations arrangements, the bidding process for the
first set of subprojects financed by the Bank was launched during the first
quarter of 2013, and it is expected that the next bidding processes will advance
during the next CPS period. Although it is hard at this time to evaluate if the
development outcome will be achieved within the new time frames, progress
during the CPS period was slow and the outcome is not observed yet. However,
since the end of 2012 and based on lessons learned, the Bank hired a local
consultant to help smooth out the implementation of these projects.

La Venta III was one the first wind parks in the Tehuantepec
Isthmus. It was the slowest to start operations but it paved
the ground for several others to come and set the standards
in terms of environmental and social safeguards.
As part of the Waste Management project, the alliance
between the public and private sector incentivized each part
to guarantee the successful development of the project and
created institutional memory which is important to reduce
the impacts of rotational management but, especially, to
ensure that experiences and practices learned are not lost.

Achieved.
Through an IDF the Bank contributed to the establishment of an online space or
information system for the dissemination of successful experiences, training material,
socio-economic information and social demographics. The grant for the creation of a
Public Observatory of Municipal Management, took the work developed under a previous
grant (TF051739) and identified areas where local governments could be improved
such as their managerial and administrative capacities to generate social and urban
development. The grant made possible the compilation of these materials and good
practices on a public website that other municipalities –not covered by the grant— could
reference, and provided the means to, for example, prepare personnel who would further
train local public servants in an improved way. This space has helped preserve and
share municipal management experiences and innovations. By end-December 2011, 20
new products were added (200% above the 2010 target) to the Municipal Management
Observatory website, and in addition, 120 new databases were also incorporated.

Partially Achieved.
Through the support of the Results Based Management project, the Performance information
was used during the 2013 budget preparation between the Ministry of Finance and line

supported the new Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) and the implementation
of the SIDAFF (Integrated Mgmt. System). Also, Federal entities and departments such
as CONEVAL and SEDESOL received Bank’s support to strengthen its M&E systems.

WBG Activities that contributed to the Outcome

The online platform demonstrated to be a cost-effective
strategy to systematize information, while creating a virtual space
to exchange good practices and other valuable knowledge.
It is essential to create a dissemination strategy and
provide adequate training on how to maximize the use of the
online platform, how to manage the information and databases
and who is responsible of updating the information.

The effectiveness of Bank support depends on commitment of
counterparts to implement reforms and change management.
During an election period, the Bank should support a sustainable
reform process thru sensitizations and capacity building
program for management and operational staff.
FBS can be a powerful instrument but the Bank needs to avoid over
quantification, and flexibility and adaptation along the way is critical.
Frequent supervision of the program, both by top authorities and an
independent audit, will allow concerned parties to anticipate corrective
actions in the face of errors, new challenges or deviations that might
take place with respect to the results expected in each phase.
Identifying strengths and/or weaknesses of working teams to
enhance the former and redress the latter in a timely fashion.
Strong ownership from the Government along with an
almost inexistent turnover in the staff with responsibilities in
the project, can lead to a successful implementation.
Using own country systems, facilitate project execution.

WBG Activities that contributed to the Outcome

The PKS shows a remarkable milestone in the focalization
of the Bank’s PSMG interventions in Mexico. It is
prioritizing the Bank’s work on public financial management
at the federal level of government and has opened a
new entry point of reform with subnational governments
with the implementation of the Oaxaca RAAP.
When working with Congress, implementing the
project gradually proved to be the wisest decision
considering the nature of the institution.
The Bank is a key development partner in this institutional
environment by contributing to convene the reform among
the different actors, to provide a safety net against certain
political interests/biases to the reform itself, and, moreover,
playing an important role at the fiduciary level since it
helps the institution to prevent potential practices that
could distort the regular funding and bidding processes.

The client’s involvement is key to improving the product.
Preparing the CATT with the involvement of
experts from other agencies and other units of
the Bank was key for project success.

Achieved.
The Bank helped strengthen and improve the institutional capacity of several institutions
such as the Federal Institute for Access to Information (IFAI) and the National Agrarian
Registry (RAN), through the implementation of different grants and knowledge services.
The IDF supporting IFAI contributed to expand the INFOMEX system to all 31 states. While a
system for access to information was in place at the federal level, subnational governments
presented a different scenario. There was a lack of institutional framework and tools to
provide adequate responses; moreover, the state governments were facing an enlarged
demand for public information in a context of increased openness and democratization. At the
time the TF054316 closed, 1,569 entities were operating INFOMEX. At least 30 states, 449 municipalities, 20 state legislative bodies and 25 state judicial entities have adopted the system.
The Bank contributed to improve the design and helped implement the Integrated
Rural Cadastral Information System in Colima. The RAN (National Agrarian Registry)
was the strategic partner to develop and coordinate and M&E system available to
public and private users. Within the scope of the IDF grant (TF056996), it was possible
to strengthen the (RAN) capacity to link geographical and legal information and
develop a sound technological platform to integrate and analyze data.
The Bank also contributed to strengthening the information system in Yucatán (SIEGEY).

The Bank helped implement the new ICT network that provided timely information on demand FY12: Judicial Modernization (P074755)
and supply of justice services in the Federal District Government (GDF). Implementation
of a new management model supported by this ICT platform was completed. Ten user
service applications uploaded to the institutional network that served as backbone of the
management model have increased user confidence and stakeholder satisfaction in the
tribunal system of justice of the GDF. New ICT network has increased public information
available. As of Dec 2011, 620,896 judicial decisions were filed in the “Judicial Resolution
Consultation System” and could be accessed by staff. Access to these decisions by the public
was expected by June 2012. Annual statistics reports have been published and disseminated
since 2010. Annual reports are also available on line. There is an online judicial bulletin
that provides the status and location of cases in courts. In the four target criminal judicial
centers, there are 22 kiosks available to the public for case status consultations.
The first survey on user satisfaction was carried out in 2010 by an independent survey firm
(EPADEC). More than half of respondents (55%) were satisfied with justice services in DF.
The level of satisfaction with the image, attention and functioning of the target criminal
courts was 63%. Users’ satisfaction reported by this survey was higher than the trust in
the justice system reported for the whole country by Americas Barometer, LAPOP, in 2010.

Status and Evaluation Summary

The importance of developing a solution that could be
customized to solve needs of different actors/governments.
The need to closely monitor fiduciary arrangements as well as to
ensure the institutional capacity to manage a Bank project.
Be cautious when expanding the scope of the activities and consider
the different dimensions affected under the new scenario.
It is expected that the experience under this FBS and the new
FBS will serve as a model to be replicated in other states.

Institutional reform projects in upper-middle income countries
may be implemented directly by line agencies, sometimes with
the support of other agencies experienced in Bank procedures.
While focusing on internal strengthening, institutional
reforms should also pay attention to demands of users or
potential users, in particular from vulnerable groups.
Working at subnational level poses additional
challenges in a complex sector.
Major cancellations and/or reallocations impacting the PDO and results
framework must be accompanied by comprehensive restructurings.
A realistic assessment of justice sector issues at the early stages of
preparation process is essential as a basis for quality project design.
Justice projects should be structured around a problem-solving strategy
and should engage all actors required to implement a proposed solution.
Civil society participation is critical at all stages of
design and implementation of justice projects.

CPSCR Annex 3. Emerging
Subnational Engagement
– State of Oaxaca
1. The World Bank has also supported since 2011 the
reform agenda for inclusive growth of Oaxaca – one of the
states with the highest levels of poverty and the lowest
levels of economic performance among the Mexican
States – through a strategic programmatic partnership.
The Bank and the Government of Oaxaca signed in June
2011 a MoU, including multi-year, multi-sectoral support
to the state, combining a package of knowledge, convening and financial services, structured around four areas:
public sector modernization, sustainable development,
finance and private sector, and human development.
2. In keeping with the flexible design of the CPS, the
MoU with Oaxaca was developed as an instrument for
coordinating AAA, loans, and grants around the critical
development challenges at the subnational level in
Mexico. The approach of this partnership is similar to
a country’s CPS, and it represents a departure from an
operational or ESW-centric approach to sector dialogue
and development solutions. It recognizes the need to
retain long-term engagement based on agreed objectives
and development challenges not subject to the unanticipated changes in financing and knowledge needs
in particular sectors. In addition, the Bank and IFC
worked together in the identification of the areas where
the active engagement of IFC on its own or jointly with
the Bank was needed, leading to IFC providing advisory
services related to public private partnerships

3. The MoU was originally established for two years,
2011-2013, and it was renewed for another two years on
June 2013. As a result of this partnership
a. Technical capacity has been built on the government counterparts in the different areas of
reform (e.g., training and workshops in strategic

sector planning, public investment, water utility management, forestry management), and
advisory services and initial diagnostics for key
public-private partnerships projects have been
provided.
b. The Bank has informed policy design and
implementation.
c. Resources have been mobilized, leveraging
co-financing of other organizations, such as
the UNDP, the MacArthur Foundation, and
Transparency International–Mexico.
d. A concurrence of key national and local
stakeholders has been brought together to the
table to participate in a specific development
agenda.
e. Concrete and fundamental tools for efficient
policymaking have been generated.
6. Some of the main outputs of this partnership to
modernize the State of Oaxaca’s public institutions and
policies have been: (a) design and implementation of a
methodology to structure strategic sector planning oriented to results; (b) design proposals for an integrated
public financial management and public investment
management systems; (c) strengthened tax administration capacity; (d) map of existing social programs; (e)
exchange of good practice to reduce maternal mortality;
(f) support the consolidation of rural financial institutions; (g) exchange of good practice on public–private
partnerships; (h) strengthen water utility management;
(i) Atlas of Climate and Climate Change; and (j) exchange of good practice on sustainable development.

Annex 3. Macroeconomic
Performance

1. Mexico’s solid economic performance stands out in a
global environment of higher volatility and lower growth.
Economic activity fully recovered from the severe contraction experienced following the global financial crisis
as a rebound and continued growth of export, domestic
investment, and consumption managed to close the output gap by the end of 2012. A track-record of prudent
monetary and fiscal policies is providing the framework,
confidence, and buffers required for a continued expansion of economic activity in line with potential output,
which is supported by strong external trade, investment
and financial ties. Progress on an ambitious structural
reform agenda, aimed at enhancing productivity may
spur investment and eventually raise the level of productivity and economic growth in a sustained way.
2. The Mexican economy rapidly recovered
from the impact of the global financial crisis
and experienced, more recently, a cyclical
downturn. After a severe contraction following the
global financial crisis, resurgence in demand for Mexican manufactured exports led to a sharp rebound in
economic activity. The output gap, generated by the
2008-2009 contraction, was expected to be closed towards the end of 2012 after the economy experienced
an average annual growth of 4.4 percent between
2010 and 2012. Moreecently, a global slowdown led
to a significant deceleration of economic growth in
Mexico widening the output gap again. Weakening
economic growth, industrial production and, in
particular a stagnation in overall import demand in
the U.S. had an adverse impact on growth of Mexican
manufactured exports as of the second half of 2012.
With an improvement of economic indicators in the
U.S., the weak spot in economic activity experienced
in 2013 is likely to be temporary and a rebound of
exports and economic growth is expected towards the
end of the year.

3. Fiscal consolidation and a slow start of public
investment further deepened the deceleration of
economic activity. Fiscal prudence continues to enjoy
broad political support as a cornerstone of macroeconomic stability in Mexico with fiscal policy being conducted
within the framework of the Fiscal Responsibility Law
(FRL). The FRL includes a balanced budget rule with
an escape clause that allows for a budget deficit under extraordinary circumstances. The latter requires the outline
of a plan to return to balanced budget. Following the severe contraction in 2009, a budget deficit of 0.8 percent of
GDP was allowed for 2010 with a three-year timeframe to
get back to a balanced budget. In effect, fiscal support has
been gradually withdrawn with budget deficits of 0.6 and
0.3 percent in 2011 and 2012, respectively, and an initial
target for 2013 to return to a zero budget deficit. The
impact of this consolidation effort on aggregate demand
was intensified by a slow start of public investment at
the beginning of the new administration, bringing public
sector capital expenditures down by almost 7 percent in
real terms during the first half of 2013. In the meantime,
the government revised fiscal consolidation plans as
it intends to maintain the planned level of expenditure
despite lower-than-expected revenue, thereby allowing
for a budget deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP this year.
4. Moderation of inflation and inflation expectations allowed the monetary authorities to lower
short-term interest rates in support of economic
activity. Despite several supply shocks that temporarily raised headline inflation earlier this year, overall
consumer price inflation and, in particular, core inflation
moderately trended down to the medium-term inflation
target of 3 percent. The success in moderating longer
term inflation and inflation expectation as well as, more
recently, the widening of the output gap led the monetary
authorities to reduce the monetary policy interest rate to
an all-time low of 3.75 percent, through reductions by

50 and 25 basis points each last March and September,
respectively. The recent policy move confirms the view
of the monetary authorities that secondary round effects
of supply shocks as well as the pass-through of exchange
rate depreciation on inflation and inflation expectations
have greatly diminished.
5. Mexico experienced a surge in capital flows that
has been largely reflected in an easing of financing
conditions. Net private capital inflows totaled more
than US$180 billion over the three year period between
2010 and 2012, equivalent to an annual average of about
6 percent of GDP. A mayor part of these flows, US$100
billion between 2010 and 2012, has been invested in domestic currency denominated government debt creating a
downward pressure on longer term interest rates as well as
an appreciation of the currency. The surge of capital flows
over the past few years did not lead to a corresponding increase in the balance of payments current account deficit.
While the economy’s external deficit did show a gradual
increase to 1.2 percent of GDP by 2012 as a result of
the economic recovery, significant capital inflows mainly
led to a substantial accumulation of external assets by
Mexican public and private economic agents, including
through direct investment of Mexican companies abroad
as well as the build-up of international reserves.
6. Economic growth will recover following
strengthening of external demand and the implementation of monetary and fiscal policies in
support of economic activity. Following the cyclical
downturn created by softness in external demand and the
subsequent weakening of domestic private consumption
and investment demand, economic activity is expected
to rebound led by strengthening of external demand as
the global economy, and in particular the U.S., emerges
from the soft patch observed in 2013. Domestic demand
will be strengthened through supportive monetary and
fiscal policies, as monetary authorities lowered short-term
interest rates and the government announced its plans
for additional spending next year. Economic growth is
projected at a level slightly above potential output growth
over the next couple of years, as the output gap generated
by the shallow recession in 2013 will be closed gradually.

7. Next year’s budget includes countercyclical fiscal
stimulus mitigating the impact on aggregate demand
of the revenue-enhancing tax reform. In addition
to a budget deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP to be incurred
in 2013 (in terms of the FRL), the proposed budget for
2014 anticipates a budget deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP to
provide for a stimulus of economic activity following the
widening of the output gap during 2013. Fiscal stimulus is
projected to be withdrawn gradually with a budget deficit
of 1.0 and 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and a return to a balanced budget by 2017. In terms
of the broader Public Sector Borrowing Requirements, the
fiscal deficit increases to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2014 and
gradually diminishes to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2017.

8. Exit from unprecedented monetary policies by
advanced economies over the next few years may
lead to reversals in gross capital flows giving rise to
higher domestic interest rates and a weaker currency. Emerging markets, including Mexico, observed a
surge in gross capital flows over the past few years, partly
attributed to unprecedented monetary policies and low
interest rates in major advanced economies. With growth
in advanced economies accelerating, prospects of a gradual exit from monetary policy support are drawing closer
possibly leading to investors’ portfolio adjustments and
a moderation or temporary reversal in gross capital flows
to emerging markets. The surge in gross capital inflows
to Mexico has been mainly absorbed by offsetting public
and private capital outflows rather than a significant
deterioration of the current account. Such a financial adjustment tends to buffer the economic impact of volatile
capital flows and moderates the required adjustment in
real economic activity in case of a sudden capital flow
reversal. Financial adjustment to capital flow volatility
mainly operates through domestic interest rates and the
exchange rate creating incentives for offsetting capital
flows, diminishing variations in net capital flows. Expectations about an exit from unprecedented monetary
policies by central banks from advanced economies
already led to a sharp steepening of the yield curve and
a significant depreciation of the currency over the past
few months and financial markets, in the case of Mexico,
were able to cope without mayor liquidity pressures or
the need for public intervention. Further sharp swings
in capital flows can be expected as investors react to
withdrawal of monetary support in advanced economies
over the next few years.
9. International reserves and an IMF Flexible
Credit Line (FCL) enhance credibility of the
policy framework providing economic resilience
to volatile capital flows. While the major part of
stabilizing financial adjustment to sudden shift in gross
capital flows should come from the buffering behavior
of private agents to changes in domestic interest rates
and the exchange rate, international reserves and
access to additional resources under the FCL provide
the means for complementing public sector contribution to financial adjustment in case of extraordinary
market conditions. International reserves have been
accumulated over the past few years as all public sector
foreign exchange transactions are channeled outside of
the market through the central bank. The public sector
has been a net recipient of foreign exchange, mainly
due to net oil sector revenue, and international reserves
at US$172 billion are up by US$80 billion compared
to the end of 2009 (previous to the recent surge in
capital flows) and by US$10 billion over the last twelve
months. Mexico renewed its FCL with the IMF in
November 2012 for a two-year period to an amount
of approximately US$73 billion, providing additional
assurance to investors on the adequacy of the economic
policy framework.

Diagnostic: Overview
Mexico Policy Notes
Mexico Reform Agenda for
Inclusive and Sustainable Growth
1. This Annex presents an overview of Mexico’s forthcoming reform agenda from the World Bank’s vantage
point (World Bank 2012). It distills the main messages
in the policy notes that make up this compendium. The
purpose is not to provide definitive answers to the many
policy questions likely to occupy the new Mexican administration, or to provide a comprehensive account of
progress to date and policy recommendations. Instead, it
is to provide a view of the main challenges facing Mexico
in its quest for inclusive and sustainable growth —and
to propose feasible policy options to address them.36
Because implementing them will prove a daunting task
for any government, prioritization is critical. The analysis
in these notes attempts to structure policy priorities with a
proposed sequencing (short-term policy options, or quick
gains in the first year; and medium-term reform options,
which may take longer to bear fruit).

2. In its quest for inclusive growth Mexico needs to
address four main challenges. These key challenges
are to: (a) increase productivity; (b) ensure that poorer
segments of society benefit from and are able to contribute to the growth process; (c) combine the economic and
environmental aspects of sustainable development; and
(d) strengthen public finances and improve government
efficiency. Achieving these objectives involves technical
work and the political challenge of addressing entrenched
interests in the public and private sectors.
3. Productivity is central to accelerating growth.
Despite progress on macroeconomic and financial

stabilization, growth in Mexico has failed to converge
with high-income economies. A reform agenda focused
on unleashing productivity could place Mexico on a
path to higher long-term growth. Such agenda includes
deepening and broadening the financial system, promoting market competition and removing regulatory barriers
for doing business, liberalizing key input sectors such as
telecommunications and energy, reducing labor market
rigidities, developing a workforce with skills for the 21st
century, and boosting innovation.
4. Growth can only be sustained with equity. Reducing poverty and inequality should be at the center of
the reform agenda. Mexico has made great progress on
reforming social policies with its flagship social programs
that have achieved universal health insurance coverage
(Seguro Popular) and have strengthened social protection
for the poor (Oportunidades). Over the last decade, the
country has also witnessed the rise of an emerging middle
class. Yet, Mexico still faces high levels of poverty and
inequality that are also a drag on economic growth. The
reform agenda needs to focus on second-generation social
policy reforms to develop the skills and the mobility of the
workforce, strengthen the performance of existing social
protection programs, broaden the coverage of the social
protection system to include the elderly and those affected
by shocks such as natural disasters and economic crises,
and reduce the middle class’s vulnerability to poverty.
5. A growth strategy that is accompanied by a deterioration of the environment is likely to be self-defeating. The reform agenda should also promote green
growth — growth that is efficient, clean, environmentally
sustainable and socially inclusive. Mexico, a global
leader on climate policy, has a long and distinguished
record on promoting environmental sustainability and
managing climate change. But the country’s vulnerability
to climate change continues to have negative impacts on

some segments of the population and environmental degradation poses challenges to the sustainability of growth.
As Mexico continues to industrialize, the incidence of
pollution and the societal pressures to use water, energy,
and forests will rise. This calls for a green growth reform
agenda that reduces the environmental footprint of growth
and optimally manages natural assets.

public programs that have been replicated around the
globe (in areas as diverse as fiscal risk management, social
assistance, and climate change). Globalization, urbanization, and democratization have given rise to an emerging
middle class that demands a modern and responsive state
— a state that not only ensures macroeconomic stability
but also provides opportunities for all.

6. Sound public finances and a more efficient government are critical for inclusive and green growth.
Mexico is a model of prudent fiscal management and a
global pioneer on public debt and fiscal risk management.
Fiscal policy, through tax measures and expenditure programs, has a central role to play in promoting productivity,
reducing poverty and inequality, and promoting green
growth. Yet, the ability of fiscal policy to deliver on these
goals is constrained by several factors. Non-oil tax collection rates are low — reflecting a narrow tax base, a complex tax system, low citizen’s trust in the state, and weak
tax administration capacity of subnational governments
that are highly reliant on Federal Government transfers.
Mounting medium-term expenditure pressures compound
these challenges as oil revenue declines and age-related
public spending rises. This calls for an integrated fiscal
and public sector modernization reform agenda that
raises non-oil tax revenue, improves the transparency and
quality of public spending, and strengthens subnational
fiscal management.

8. Like many other countries in Latin America,
however, Mexico faces challenges in its quest for
inclusive growth. It is a country of contrasts — rich
and poor states, dynamic urban centers and isolated rural
areas, small informal enterprises serving the domestic
market and large companies competing abroad, top executives graduated from top universities abroad and youth
who neither work nor study.

Unleashing productivity
7. Mexico has achieved remarkable economic and
social progress over the past several decades. The
country has become an investment grade borrower with
solid global standing in capital markets. It is a model of
financial and commercial integration and of prudent macroeconomic management. It is also a pioneer of innovative

9. Unlike some major emerging market economies,
Mexico has failed to catch up with high-income
economies. It enjoyed macroeconomic and financial
stability, market-oriented economic policy reforms, openness to foreign trade and investment, and a “demographic
bonus,” with a rising share of the working-age population
over the past decades. But Mexico has not unleashed high
growth rates, failing to close the gap with high-income
economies. Over the past decade the Mexican economy
grew at less than 2 percent a year, well below the regional
average (4 percent). Its per capita income has remained
at about 30 percent of that of the United States.37 By
contrast, East Asia’s per capita income, which tripled over
the past three decades, is currently at about 60 percent of
that of the United States (Figure 1).
10. Mexico’s trailing productivity partially explains
its slow income convergence. The country’s growth has
largely been driven by capital and labor accumulation, not
by growth in labor productivity (average output per worker)
or total factor productivity (combined efficiency of labor

and capital). While physical capital accumulation rates
are within reasonable range by international standards,
labor productivity and total factor productivity collapsed
during the eighties and have remained low since then.
This explains the limited contribution of productivity to
Mexico’s economic growth over the last fifteen years. Total
factor productivity is interpreted in the economic literature as a measure of technological progress and explains
a substantial share of the per capita income differences
across countries (Bosworth and Collins 2013: 113-79).
11. The economic literature offers several explanations for Mexico’s low productivity growth. An
underdeveloped financial system, labor market rigidities,
high informality, scarce skilled labor, regulatory barriers
for doing business, and weak innovation and limited
market competition are often cited as binding constraints
to productivity growth (Hanson 2010). It has proven hard
to establish empirically the relative importance of each
of these obstacles to productivity growth. In the absence
of rigorous empirical evidence of the most binding constraint to growth, this note argues that making progress
on several of these obstacles may be a reasonable strategy
to accelerate growth, particularly in view of the possible
interactions between some of these constraints. The next
sections discuss these challenges in greater detail.

Deepening and broadening the financial sector
12. Thanks to the financial sector reforms implemented over the last decade, Mexico has a sound
banking system and a diversified set of financial
intermediaries. Financial sector oversight has been revamped and assessments of compliance with international
supervisory standards note the high quality of the current
financial regulatory and supervisory framework, especially for the banking sector. Authorities have been pro-active
in adopting measures to protect financial sector stability
from external shocks and endogenous developments; and
following lessons from the recent global financial crisis,
Mexico was among the first countries in the world in creating a formal body in charge of systemic risk monitoring.
Also, in recent years there have been substantial efforts
to improve financial inclusion through the operation of
banking correspondent agents, propitiating the use of
new technologies (such as mobile phones) for financial
transactions, improving financial infrastructure (i.e.,
collateral registries and credit bureaus), and using public
institutions and resources to catalyze private sector
funding toward small and medium-size enterprises as
opposed to crowding private sector activity (i.e., through
the creation of an electronic factoring platform and public
credit guarantees schemes).

13. Yet, Mexico’s financial sector remains small for
its stage of development, impeding the channeling
of financial savings into long-term productive
investments. The market for government debt is deep
and liquid, but there are few issuers in the private bond
and corporate equity markets. The financial system has
done a fair job of mobilizing savings in recent years but
continues to lag in risk taking and maturities, limiting its
contribution to growth. Commercial bank lending focuses
on consumer credit, which has higher intermediation
margins. Institutional investors, including pension funds
and mutual funds, hold many of their assets in fixed-income securities, mostly government bonds. Deepening
and broadening Mexico’s financial system could support
the growth and investment of credit constrained SME’s
and households, raise productivity, and spur growth. Improving creditor rights and insolvency procedures could
also enhance firms’ access to credit. Continued efforts are
required to foster financial sector development and inclusion while maintaining the soundness of the financial
system (refer to Mexico Policy Note 1).

Promoting competition and
streamlining business regulations
14. Strengthening competition and reducing the
costs of doing businesses are key to boost productivity. The availability, quality, and cost of inputs
in the production process, such as capital, labor and
intermediate goods and services, as well as the cost to
operate a business are critical for firm productivity. In
international benchmark exercises, including the World
Bank’s annual Doing Business exercise, Mexico at times
stands out for the high cost and/or low availability for key
inputs in the production process (refer to Mexico Policy

Note 2). High concentration in key sectors of the economy
and restrictive regulation hinder competition and aggregate productivity growth. Monopolistic behavior results in
higher prices, inefficient resource allocation, consumer
deadweight loss, and disincentives to innovate or invest.
Similarly, regulatory burden for firms can also increase
the costs of doing business. National and subnational
regulations, such as those related to the cost of enforcing
contracts and the time needed to obtain licenses and
permits, restrict the ability of firms to do business, while
monopolistic behavior reinforces inequalities by hurting
low-income households disproportionally (refer to Mexico
Policy Note 2).
15. In recent years, Mexico has made progress
in supporting a more competitive business environment and streamlining of business regulations.
Amendments to the Federal Competition Law have been
adopted that strengthen the power of the Federal Competition Agency to investigate non-competitive market behavior as well as to impose more significant monetary and
criminal sanctions to deter economic agents from such
practices. With regards to the streamlining of business
regulations, progress has been made in facilitating tax
filing and payment procedures, the elimination of redundant testing and certification requirements by recognizing
the equivalence of Mexican product standards and certifications with international ones and the development
of a Single Trade Window that will allow enterprises to
comply with all trade related regulations through a single
electronic platform.
16. But more needs to be done to remove barriers
to competition and reduce the costs of doing business. Reforms to promote market competition could focus
on ensuring an effective implementation of the Federal

Competition Law; and creating a high-level commission
with the mandate of recommending the elimination of
anticompetitive practices at the subnational level. The
cost of doing business could be substantially reduced with
reforms aimed to simplify firm registration procedures,
reduce the cost of formal hiring and firing processes and
ensure effective and prompt contract enforcement.
17. As a network industry, telecommunications
is critical for promoting firm productivity. The
telecommunications sector is undergoing radical technological and regulatory changes throughout the world. In
Mexico, the overwhelming dominance of the incumbent
in the sector has caused improvements to be far smaller
than those observed elsewhere. Penetration of telecommunication services in Mexico still shows a lower level
and slower growth compared to OECD countries or Latin
American peers. In 2010, the penetration rates (number
of subscribers per 100 inhabitants) for fixed telephony,
mobile telephony, and broadband services in Mexico were
18, 78, and 10, respectively, compared to 36, 114, and
25 in OECD countries, and 21, 106, and 10.3 in Chile.
This is partly attributed to higher prices and low-network
coverage in rural areas. Using the OECD methodology
of representative baskets on consumption, prices for
moderate use of mobile phone services exceed the OECD
average by around 30 percent and fixed-line prices for
moderate-use consumer and business services exceed
OECD averages by 67 and 82 percent, respectively, in
PPP terms (OECD 2011).
18. Recent reforms sought to improve investment
and competition in the telecommunications sector.
But a more ambitious reform is required to boost productivity. Examples of recent reforms include auctions
for the lease of part of the optic fiber network owned by
the state-owned Federal Electricity Commission for data
transmission and for the use of radio spectrum for mobile
telephony, as well as a program to support the reduction
of interconnection rates for mobile telephony termination.
Additional regulatory interventions are needed to facilitate entry in the telecommunications sector. Eliminating
restrictions to foreign ownership and developing an
integral and transparent interconnection policy are key
elements of the reform agenda. In the event that such
measures fail to increase competition, sector regulators
could be given the power to break up companies with
monopolistic power whenever they abuse their dominant
position in the market. While such powers are difficult to
implement in practice, the mere threat of being able to do
so could induce more competitive behavior.

19. Opening the energy sector to private participation in core activities could also contribute to
productivity growth. Dominating Mexico’s energy
sector, state-owned companies, as a result of being
insulated from meaningful competition, have been slow
to adapt and innovate in response to changing market
conditions, technologies, and management practices.

The operation of state-owned electricity companies is
constrained by federal budget controls and ceilings that
have led to insufficient investment, and political interference in pricing policies and investment priorities.
These constraints hamper longer-term prospects for
oil and gas supply and the development of downstream
capacity, pipelines and storage facilities to meet rising
domestic demand. Similarly, relatively high prices
for electricity use by the industrial and commercial
sectors (as opposed to subsidized rates for residential
and agricultural use) as well as low quality of service
delivery increase the cost of doing business. An energy
reform promoting greater efficiency and a diversification
of financing sources for investment will enable a more
dynamic energy sector and a more adequate provision of
a key production input that could raise firm productivity.
The energy reform goes hand and hand with fiscal and
green growth policy reforms. The discussion of the
fiscal dependence on oil revenues, energy pricing and
subsidies, the promotion of energy efficiency and the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are discussed in
more detail in this compendium (Refer to Mexico Policy
Notes 6, 7, and 10).

Reducing labor market rigidities
20. Labor market rigidities constrain the efficient
allocation of labor across firms and industries.
Rigid labor market regulations prevent the Mexican
labor from working efficiently. The cost of employing
formal sector workers remains high because of fairly
rigid labor market regulations, particularly regarding
dismissal (Figure 4). Furthermore, severance pay regulations likely reduce companies’ willingness to adopt new
productivity enhancing technologies, for fear of threat to
job security. While informality is partly a reflection of
Mexico’s stage of development and of labor market rigidities, the large number of informal firms reinforces low
productivity levels. Lower wages in the informal sector
reflect a productivity gap, resulting from credit and technology constraints, limited access to employee training,
and a bias against growth in order to continue to hide
their activities. Addressing regulatory hurdles in hiring
and firing workers, reducing formalization costs and,
strengthening unemployment insurance could improve
labor market efficiency and enhance productivity (refer
to Mexico Policy Note 4).

Promoting innovation
21. Boosting innovation in Mexico is critical for
growth and productivity. Empirical evidence suggests
that sustained productivity growth is contingent upon
increasing knowledge generation and absorption.38 Intermediate indicators for innovation, such as investments in
research and development (R&D), technology licensing,
and patenting, suggest that Mexico faces an innovation

shortfall. Investments in R&D remain low relative to
countries with a similar GDP per capita: 0.4 percent of
GDP in 2009, well below other emerging markets such
as Brazil and China and even farther below such top
innovators as the Republic of Korea and Sweden (Figure
5). Furthermore, Mexico has yet to fully exploit the opportunities that its proximity to the United States offers for
technological progress and productivity. Despite the long
history of computer assembly in Mexico for U.S. companies, there is little indigenous patenting or evidence of
new startups or spillovers, as in Korea. The quality of
scientific institutions and collaboration between universities and firms also remains below a number of comparator
countries (refer to Mexico Policy Note 3).
22. The reform agenda to boost innovation
seeks to raise public R&D, improve the quality
of scientific institutions, and strengthen links

between universities and businesses. Policy reforms
to promote innovation started with the enactment of the
Law on Science and Technology in 2002. These reforms
were followed by programs that sought to encourage
technology transfer and R&D by private firms. In 2009,
subsequent amendments to the Science and Technology
Law expanded its scope to incorporate business innovation as a key policy objective; and to remove regulatory
constraints to technology transfer. Going forward, the
challenge is to strengthen the capacity of public research centers for technology transfer activities to take
root. Sectoral programs to encourage applied research
have been put in place as well as increased investment
in human capital to improve the quality of scientific
institutions. Further resources need to be devoted to
increase R&D funding, improve the quality of R&D
programs and develop monitoring and evaluation tools
to assess their impact.

Developing worker skills and
facilitating job matching
23. Mexico has achieved near universal primary
school completion, but it lags its Latin American
and Caribbean (LAC) and OECD peers in higher
education enrollment. While 35 percent of the Mexican labor force has completed secondary school, more
than 70 percent of OECD workers have done so (Figure
6). Despite a 50 percent increase in tertiary education
enrolment over the past decade, current enrollment rates
of 30 percent lag behind the LAC average (37 percent).
Enrolment rates in vocational training programs in
Mexico are half of those in Brazil and Colombia and
only one-fifth of those in Turkey and Poland. In addition
to improving the coverage of education and training
programs, Mexico needs to strengthen the quality of
education.
24. Mexico’s performance on international cognitive skill tests has improved over recent years.
But, it lags behind OECD peers; and the quality of the
skills development system remains low. Over the past
decade, the performance of Mexican students on the
PISA international learning test (measuring largely
cognitive skills) has improved. But Mexico still lags
behind its peers. Among the 14 countries, with a similar GDP per capita as Mexico, that applied the PISA
test, Mexico ranks 10th in reading and 11th in math
and science tests (Figure 6). Going forward, Mexico
needs to improve its skills development system, both
in schools and training institutions, to provide workers
with the broad set of skills required to innovate and
compete globally.

constraint to labor demand and firm expansion.
Socio-emotional skills have increasingly been promoted, as reflected in the recent Upper Secondary School
Reform. But they are not sufficiently valued and taught
by the skills development system. Roughly one-third of
firms consider inadequate worker skills an obstacle to
firm expansion, and more than two-fifths struggle to fill
vacancies for low-skilled jobs (compared with 31 percent
on average in other countries). While employers continue
to demand cognitive (numeracy, literacy, problem-solving) and technical skills, a recent survey found that 40
percent of Mexican firms identified socio-emotional skills
(such as communications, customer relations, teamwork)
as the most difficult skill set to find (refer to Mexico
Policy Note 4).
26. Productivity is also constrained by inefficient
matching of workers and firms. More than half of
Mexican workers find their jobs through family, friends,
and other personal contacts. This informal matching
mechanism likely results in the misallocation of skills
and lowers productivity. Public spending on job intermediation services is lower in Mexico than in other OECD
countries. The absence of unemployment support may be
responsible for quick rather than efficient job matches.
Reform options for addressing these challenges include
a national strategy for building labor market–relevant
skills; continued reorientation of upper-secondary school
toward the labor market; portability of skills across the
education, training, and labor market systems; and facilitating job search and matching by developing integral
employment services, including unemployment insurance
(refer to Mexico Policy Note 4).

25. Mexican firms report skill mismatch in cognitive, technical, and social-emotional skills as a

Reducing poverty and inequality
27. Low productivity growth is linked to high levels
of poverty and inequality. Inequity of opportunity
in access to key economic and social services (such as
education, credit, and infrastructure) prevents a large
segment of the Mexican population from fully realizing
their economic potential. This reduces productivity
and slows growth, and perpetuates existing poverty and
high-income inequality. Breaking this vicious circle is
difficult and requires an integrated reform agenda focused
on economic and social objectives that are mutually reinforcing (Bourguignon and Dessus 2009: 45-69).
28. Poverty in Mexico remains high and increased
in recent years. Between 2006 and 2010, the moderate
poverty rate increased from 42.7 percent to 51.3 (to 57.7
million people) and the extreme poverty rate from 13.8
percent to 19.8 (to 21.2 million people). The increase in
poverty, in 2008 and 2010, broke a decade-long trend of
poverty reduction. In 2010, 57.7 million people suffered
from patrimony poverty, 12.2 million more than in 2006
(Figure 7). Until 2006 Mexico kept pace with the rest of
Latin America and the Caribbean in poverty reduction.
But since 2008 the economy suffered a series of shocks

— global food price crisis, global financial crisis, the
AH1N1-flu epidemic, natural disasters, and a recent wave
of drug-related crime — that slowed economic growth.
29. The recent increase in poverty was largely
driven by a rise in urban moderate poverty. As of
2010, poverty rates are higher in rural areas (with 6 out
of 10 households in rural areas are poor), but the largest
group of people living in poverty is located in urban
areas — 35 million people in urban areas compared to 17
million people in rural areas based on multi-dimensional
poverty measures (CONEVAL, 2011). The sharp increase
in urban poverty that began in 2008 is at the center of the
social policy and labor market reform debates. Stagnant
real wages and higher unemployment and underemployment likely drove the increase in moderate urban poverty
from 2008 to 2010. At the same time, safety nets in urban
areas are not as well targeted as those in rural areas. The
Temporary Employment Program (Programa de Empleo
Temporal) focuses mainly on rural areas. It was expanded
to urban areas in 2009 but could not prevent the increase
in urban poverty. The flagship social protection program
Oportunidades was not designed to quickly sign up transient populations that may fall into poverty when a crisis
hits.

30. Inequality and the vulnerability of the Mexican
middle class have also risen. Over the last decade,
Mexico has seen the emerging rise of the country’s
middle class.39 However, the vulnerability of the middle
class to shocks and downward economic mobility is at the
center of economic policy debates. Following the recent
global economic crisis per capita income growth (20082010) turned negative for all income deciles (by more
than 2 percentage points). The largest income losses were
for those in the top and bottom of the income distribution,
with those in moderate poverty experiencing the smallest
loss. Limited social security coverage (limited unemployment insurance and high out-of-pocket health spending)
explains Mexico’s middle-class vulnerability to fall back
into poverty when a crisis hits. The expansion of social
programs, targeted at the lowest-income households, has
not been accompanied by an increase in social security
insurance for those vulnerable groups earning incomes
above the poverty line (Torche and López-Calva 2010).

inclusive growth. In Mexico, most of the decline in
poverty over the past decade was driven by demographic
factors (the increase in the adult population). In contrast,
for Latin America the rise in labor income was the main
contributor to poverty reduction (Figure 8). Since 2008,
the labor poverty trend index (a leading indicator of poverty which tracks the number of individuals who cannot
obtain the basic food basket with their labor income)
has been on the rise, suggesting that poverty is likely to
remain high. To reduce poverty and inequality, Mexico’s
reform agenda needs to address several related challenges: (a) labor market failures that hinder the creation of
more and better jobs; (b) the impact of natural disasters
and economic crises on the poor; (c) lack of protective
measures to reduce households’ vulnerability; and (d)
regional disparities reflected in unequal opportunities in
access and quality of basic social services.

Promoting labor markets for inclusive growth

31. Regional income disparities remain a concern.
Income per capita in the richest state was 6.7 times that of
the lowest in 1950, and 6.1 in 2000. In 2010 the state with
the highest moderate poverty was Chiapas (78.4 percent),
followed by Guerrero and Oaxaca (each at 67.2 percent),
while Nuevo Leon had the lowest (28.7 percent). Income
disparities across Mexican municipalities are also large.
In addition, access to and quality of public service delivery also varies significantly across regions. The states and
municipalities with higher poverty rates tend to be those
more prone to crime and/or natural disasters, and those
where the population is spread in mountainous locations
with limited accessibility to basic social services.

33. Mexico faces challenges as it seeks to develop
a labor market that protects workers, creates more
and better jobs for men and women, and improve
their long-term standard of living. A move toward
labor formalization, institutionalization of universal social
protection, and improved education and skill development for all workers could contribute to higher labor
productivity and economic growth.

32. The rise in poverty and vulnerability, underscores the urgency of a reform agenda focused
on reducing the inequity of opportunities through

34. Labor is the main source of income for most
of the population, particularly for low-income
households. The reliance on labor income by low-income households reinforces the importance of promoting
a dynamic labor market that can contribute to poverty
reduction. While labor income has been the main
driver of poverty reduction and upward mobility in Latin

America, it has not delivered similar results in Mexico.
Between 2000 and 2010 it only contributed 23 percent
to the decline in moderate poverty in Mexico compared
to 41 percent in the region (Figure 8). Gender disparities
in labor income remain, with female workers earning on
average 20 percent less than their male peers (World
Bank 2012c).
35. Mexico’s large informal sector reinforces
inequality. The mobility between the formal and the informal labor markets provides a buffer against unemployment during economic downturns. But informality limits
the Government’s public spending capacity and restricts
social insurance benefits. The prevalence of informality
leaves approximately half the workforce outside the social
security system, thereby exacerbating inequities. During
the 2008 financial crisis, only workers with access to the
formal pension system were able to use early withdrawal
from retirement accounts as a protective mechanism to
smooth consumption. The informal workforce also generates fiscal pressures for the Government. On the one
hand, it results in a narrow tax base. On other hand, the
Government needs to fund a parallel set of non-contributory social programs for the informal sector. Programs
seeking to protect informal workers can have unexpected
implications since they can make informality more attractive for new entrants and lead to a reallocation of workers
to lower productivity activities. In spite of the economy
recovery since 2010, informality rates have remained
constant with two in every three new entrants to the labor
market being informal.
36. Recent economic shocks added to existing labor market pressures. Labor supply is outpacing labor
demand. Higher than expected population growth, a 5
percent rise in labor force participation rates since 2005,
and a sharp reversal in migration to the United States have
significantly increased the labor supply. Before the 2008
crisis, the Mexican economy was able to absorb labor
supply, maintaining steady and fairly low unemployment.
However, in the second half of 2008 and in 2009 a gap
opened between labor supply and labor demand. By 2010
employment growth once again matched labor supply, but
the gap remains.
37. Labor force composition has shifted toward
lower-quality jobs. The share of the workforce in
tradable sector jobs declined since 2005 but increased in
non-tradable services — the latter characterized by low
productivity. Despite the economic recovery, real wages
have remained stagnant and even fallen; in 2010 they
still remained around 90 percent of their 2008 levels.
The number of jobs paying below two minimum wages, up
during the crisis, represents the highest share of all jobs,
unlike previous years where jobs paying between two and
three minimum wages were most common.
38. The reform agenda should focus on increasing
worker skills, addressing labor market rigidities and

improving social protection. Due to the importance of
labor income for lower-income households, social inclusion should be fostered through interventions that help
the most vulnerable groups acquire labor market-oriented
skills and access the labor market. More generally, the
Government should aim to strengthen skills development
through education and training services, improve employment intermediation services, address labor market
rigidities, and promote active labor market programs. The
agenda also needs to strengthen the social protection system, in particular unemployment insurance, for the poor
and the non-poor vulnerable to sudden income losses in
a crisis.

Improving social protection
39. Despite recent progress, social protection
faces important equity and efficiency challenges.
Mexico’s social protection system includes several
contributory social security schemes, social assistance
programs, and labor market programs. Social protection programs such as Oportunidades are globally recognized as quite successful. But the social protection
system as a whole suffers from fragmented programs,
weak design, and gaps in coverage (refer to Mexico
Policy Note 5).
40. The social protection system remains fragmented. In health insurance the different contributory schemes and the Social Protection System in
Health operate in parallel with little coordination.
Each scheme has its own funding source, insurance pool,
administration structure, financial reserves, and service
provider network — resulting in large inefficiencies. For
labor markets, programs overlap and are duplicative.
At the federal level, 63 programs and actions promote
income generation and economic well-being, many with
the same goals and target populations (mostly indigenous
and rural).
41. The social protection system faces weaknesses
in the design and targeting of programs. Mexico has
gained experience in targeting social protection programs
to the poor (Oportunidades and Seguro Popular). But some
social programs (such as the energy subsidies) continue to
disproportionately benefit the wealthiest while absorbing
a large share of resources. Other programs are regressive
by design, such as the Employment Subsidy Program
(Subsidio para el Empleo), which covers only formal sector
workers (less than 5 percent of the subsidies go to the
poorest household decile).
42. Even the most successful programs suffer from
inefficiencies. An organizational and functional reform
of health insurance schemes, in particular related to the
separation of financing and provision, as well as provider
payment mechanisms to allow strategic purchasing
could strengthen performance. Using production-based

COUNTRY
PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR

MEXICAN
STATES

payments more would offer incentives for providers to
decrease inefficiencies while improving quality, particularly if purchasing across different schemes becomes the
norm. Oportunidades would benefit from reviewing those
conditions that originally motivated the program and
making appropriate adjustments, including the need for
greater focus on promoting the employability of beneficiaries, support to those living in disaster-prone regions,
efficiency in urban areas, and mechanisms of intervention
in indigenous areas.
43. Gaps in coverage particularly affect the poor
and vulnerable and those in the informal sector.
Employment services, which promote employability and
intermediation, have limited coverage, while important
gaps persist in urban and peri-urban areas. The pension
system also poses challenges. Only 7 percent of those
age 65 or older in the poorest decile receive a pension,
compared with 41 percent in the richest. The recent
expansion of noncontributory programs — such as 70 y
más and Seguro Popular — address some of the gaps, but
they remain insufficient to ensure full old-age protection.
While some instruments can protect households in times
of emergencies or crises, the Social Protection System
lacks the full range of mechanisms to mitigate the negative impact of economic shocks.

Promoting Green and
Inclusive Growth
44. While inclusive growth is central for income
convergence and poverty reduction, the environment, and the use of the country’s natural resources
must be recognized as an integral part of Mexico’s
reform agenda. It is widely recognized that economic
growth is a critical driver of social and human development. But international experience has demonstrated that
it is often accompanied by the deterioration of the local
and global environment, while adversely impacting the
poorest and most vulnerable members of society. This
highlights the importance of a green growth agenda that
mitigates environmental damage while ensuring sustainable and inclusive development (Hallegatte and others,
2011).

COUNTRY
PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR
THE UNITED
MEXICAN
STATES

104

45. Green growth is defined as growth that is
efficient, clean, environmentally sustainable, and
socially inclusive. While sustainable development is
often treated as a longer-term objective, green growth is
the short term path to this longer-term objective, with a
focus on more immediate concerns. The green growth
approach is concerned with what needs to occur in the
short term (over the next 5-10 years), before the world
gets locked into patterns that would be irreversible and
extremely expensive to modify, and it aims to maximize
synergies and economic co-benefits (Hallegatte and
others, 2011).

46. Mexico has a long and distinguished record on
many aspects of environmental sustainability and
climate change. The country is widely recognized as a
global leader on climate change and is a pioneer among
developing countries in climate change policy and negotiations. The country’s comprehensive strategy for climate
resilient, low-carbon economic growth is one of the most
ambitious in the world.
47. Yet, the country’s vulnerability to climate
change remains high, especially in the rural areas. Mexico is experiencing longer and hotter periods
resulting in droughts, more intense rains and hurricanes,
frequent flooding, and mudslides. Environmental change
is having, and will continue to have, disproportionally
negative effects on poor and indigenous groups who
depend on climate-sensitive sources of income. A World
Bank study found that “Estimates of the macroeconomic
cost of climatic natural disasters suggest that on average,
each of them causes a 0.6 percent reduction in real GDP
per capita. To the extent that, since the 1990s, such
events have taken place on average once every three
years—compared to once every four years in the period
since 1950—their average impact on the affected countries would be a 2 percent reduction in GDP per capita
per decade” (De la Torre and others, 2009: 4).
48. As one of the largest contributors of carbon
dioxide (CO2) in Latin America and the Caribbean,
Mexico has adopted an ambitious plan to drive
down GHG emissions.
Mexico ranks 12th in the
world in CO2 emissions (with 471.46 million tons CO2
emissions)40 (Figure 10). The climate change agenda includes partnership with the states as well as the recently
approved General Climate Change Bill (Ley General de
Cambio Climático), which calls for a 30 percent CO2
reduction by 2020 and a 50 percent reduction by 2050
(compared with 2000 level).
49. In spite of Mexico’s commendable performance on the global and domestic climate agenda,
local environmental pressures continue to rise. One
commonly used aggregate indicator is the Environmental
Performance Index (EPI), which is a summary of 25
different measures of environmental pressure.41 The EPI
combines air and water pollution estimates, resource
depletion, and aspects related to policy and institutional
frameworks. As with any broad measure, there are problems with aggregation and interpretation, but the EPI is
a useful starting point to assess how countries perform
relative to their peers. Latin America scores well relative
to other developing economies, and Mexico is a mid-range
performer within the region (Figure 11).

the installation of green equipment accessory packages
(such as solar heaters, low-energy bulbs and low water
consumption toilets and faucets). Initially designed as an
addition to the regular mortgage loan, the Green Mortgage
Program has evolved and now also applies to remodeling,
expansion, and construction activities. The program
began in March 2008 and was modified in 2011 in an attempt to broaden the choices to select accessory packages
and hence promote greener consumption patterns. Before
2011 the program package was fixed and depended on
climatic zones. Currently the beneficiary can either buy a
house with installed equipment or chose the equipment to
install in the house.
51. Going forward, two critical policy concerns
need to be addressed to promote greener and more
inclusive growth – tackling the environmental footprint (externalities) and managing natural assets
under pressure. As Mexico grows and industrializes
further, so too will the incidence of pollution if there are
no compensating policy responses. Similarly, demands

on common property natural resources such as water and
forests will continue to rise, enhancing the need for policy
innovation and stewardship.
52. Greening growth requires reducing the environmental footprint of the urban economy. In
particular, the following pending policy issues related to
land use planning, waste collection, urban pollution, and
energy efficiency should be addressed (refer to Mexico
Policy Note 6):
• Urban planning. Mexico is a highly urbanized country. Reducing the resource intensity
of current urban development might lead to significant efficiency gains, and an improvement
of economic activities, thus enhancing the
efficiency and quality of growth. Urbanization
also has negative externalities that impact
and adversely affect quality of life, environmental sustainability, and exposure to natural
disasters, mainly for the most vulnerable.

PARTNERSHIP

THE UNITED

STATES

Addressing these externalities (in an economically appropriate manner) would yield a double
dividend — efficiency and economic gains in
terms of improved land use management and
greater productivity and resilience.
• The brown agenda. Although Mexico has
developed good environmental legislation and
protection strategies related to waste management,38 these are not being adequately implemented, especially at the local level. There are
still important gaps, including an insufficient
number of solid and hazardous waste disposal
facilities; municipal sewage and industrial
effluents polluting rivers in urban areas and
costal environments; and serious air, water,
and land pollution especially in urban centers.
Contaminated sites can result in significant
human health impacts, often associated with
poor or marginalized communities.
• Energy efficiency. Energy is one of the most
important sectors in the Mexican economy.
First, oil revenues contribute at least one-third
of the federal budget, yet oil production and
reserves have been steadily declining. Second,
being state owned and financially constrained
by the federal budget ceiling, the energy sector
has been limited in terms of technological progress, corporate practices, and pricing policies.
Third, energy consumption and production
contribute over 60 percent of Mexico’s total
GHG emissions. Enhancing energy efficiency
would improve the country’s competitiveness
and mitigate the fiscal burden from energy
subsidies, as well. However, energy policies
involve crucial economic, environmental, and
social tradeoffs; so paying close attention to this
issue should be a high priority going forward.

53. Green growth also requires managing the
use of natural resources optimally. Progress and
challenges regarding forests, water management and the
energy sector include the following (refer to Mexico Policy
Note 7):
• Forest and biodiversity management.
While Mexico’s forests have long been valued
as a source of timber, they are increasingly
being appreciated for their role in helping to
regulate the environment. Mexico ranks twelfth
worldwide in forest cover, with 33 percent of its
area being classified as either forests or “wooded land” (FAO 2010). Poverty is widespread in
forest communities, owing to degradation (the
usual common property problem) as well as
market failures that do not recognize the value
of environmental services generated in forests.
Hence stewardship of forests and biodiversity
must continue to rank highly on the policy
agenda.
• Water management. Reduced water availability and poor water quality are two of the
main factors that will affect economic growth
and development in Mexico. Water resources
in Mexico are scarce and heterogeneously
distributed across the country, with the bulk
of the water supply concentrated in the south
while the population and demands are greatest
in the more arid north of the country (Figure
12). About 63 percent of the supply comes
from surface water sources, and 37 percent
is from groundwater sources (CONAGUA,
2011). Despite steady improvements in water
management across the country, there is ample
evidence of the costs associated with poor
water governance and includes diseases, rising
costs of alternative sources, and the costs of the

implicit electricity subsidy to Mexican farmers
(Muñoz Piña and others, 2006). But it is the
unsustainable extraction of groundwater that
remains by far the biggest unresolved challenge in Mexico.
• Renewable energy. The possibility of Mexico turning into a net oil importer poses the
challenge of radically transforming the energy
matrix composition. The heavily based hydrocarbon structure and the declining oil production affect the configuration of the power sector
and other industrial energy uses. Through the
introduction of newer technologies and regulatory changes, the power sector has become the
main driver of natural gas demand in Mexico.
Diversification through the expanded use of
renewable energy sources is a key element to
strengthening the long-term sustainability of
the Mexican economy.
54. Finally, a comprehensive system for tracking
and monitoring progress and environmental pressures needs to be developed. Mexico’s leadership
and early efforts at developing green GDP accounts are
steps in the right direction. Going forward, the remaining challenge is to: (a) strengthen available measures
for each sector (physical and economic indicators of
environmental progress) and (b) build on the green
GDP accounts to guide macroeconomic and sectoral
policies.

Promoting sound public finances
and efficient government
55. Sound public finances and an efficient government are critical to achieve and sustain a green and
inclusive growth agenda. A modern public administration is fundamental for executing public programs
effectively and efficiently and for raising the resources
required to finance these programs. An efficient and
coordinated public administration with well-articulated
institutions is also required to manage medium-term
fiscal pressures through policy choices consistent with
available resources. In some areas (such as macroeconomic policy and public debt management) Mexico has
developed the necessary institutions and systems. In
others, such as the management of expenditure to achieve
quality results, progress has been made at establishing a
framework, but challenges remain to improve the working
of the entire budgetary and policy cycle. Finally, although
improvements have taken place in tax administration in
recent years, Mexico faces the challenge of developing a
broad-based taxation system that substantially enhances
public revenue to finance its development effort without
discouraging investment and formal sector employment
generation.

Improving service delivery and the
quality of expenditure management
56. In recent years Mexico has undertaken a
number of important initiatives to improve the
quality of expenditure and service delivery. These
include developing a new legal framework to increase expenditure efficiency, including a Performance Evaluation
System (Sistema de Evaluación del Desempeño,
or SED). Affecting all three levels of government, the
framework:
•D
 efines new policies on results-based management and budgeting;
• S trengthens budget discipline by improving
budget management across the budget cycle,
from planning through execution to audit and
evaluation;
• Introduces a financial management information
system (Sistema Integral de Administración
Financiera Federal, or SIDAFF), which began
implementation in 2012; and
•E
 stablishes a specialized function for comprehensive evaluation of selected Federal Government policies and programs within the Ministry
of Finance (refer to Mexico Policy Note 9).
57. All of these initiatives have yielded benefits,
but require institutionalization for Mexico to improve public sector performance and the quality
of expenditures. Budget and financial management
covering key functions in the budget cycle, from planning
to execution to evaluation, have traditionally focused on
process compliance and input control. These functions
and systems need further upgrading to provide public sector managers and decision-makers with relevant, timely,
high-quality information on financial inputs and outputs
and on outcomes from public projects and programs. This
challenge requires actions on several fronts: continue
to implement modern harmonized accounting standards
and performance-informed budgeting policies, using information technologies more intensively for public sector
management (e-government), raising standards of administrative procedures and procurement, and strengthening
the capacity of federal and subnational governments to
deliver high-quality public goods and services in a timely
fashion.
58. The performance budgeting and evaluation
system reform led by the Ministry of Finance has
advanced a results- and performance-informed
orientation in the federal budget process. To
incorporate results and performance dimensions into
resource allocation, the new system uses performance
indicators for public sector programs, along with systematic evaluations of public sector policies and programs.

PARTNERSHIP

Consolidating performance-based budgeting at the federal and state level depends on consolidating the SIDAFF
and equivalent state financial management systems,
improving the quality of the performance information,
institutionalizing the evaluation function, and working
with sector ministries to consolidate the performance
culture, implement the new tools and processes, and
expand capacities to use them. As experience from other
countries shows, setting up a performance-informed system requires a culture change, with a new management
style based on performance incentives; management delegation; and a focus on inputs, outputs, and outcomes. In
addition, because results-informed management requires
mechanisms for accounting, reporting, and consolidating
information, accounting systems are being modernized
and harmonized.
59. Completing the accounting harmonization program will remain a challenge for the next administration. This task, not simply technical, will require
strong political leadership to ensure that the accounting
and reporting changes are implemented as the basis for
effective resource management in the public sector. At the
subnational level, supporting the country’s 1,200 smaller
and less-developed municipalities must be a priority.
60. At the subnational level, it will be important to
provide support and incentives for implementing
state-level financial management systems consistent
with the accounting harmonization. For states and municipalities, establishing a common budget classification
system in parallel with accounting harmonization would
enhance fiscal transparency and support standardization
across levels of government. A more transparent and
consolidated accounting framework would improve expenditure monitoring and encourage efficiency and accountability. Incentive mechanisms for subnational governments
that adopt an integrated system, and support to those that
are willing to move forward first, to implement the new
accounting standards will be important through 2013.

61. Improving the efficiency of government delivery of goods and services requires continuing the
procurement system reform initiated in 2009. Mexico’s public procurement system has a large impact on the
country’s economy: public procurement accounts for 40
percent of the federal budget and about 10 percent of GDP,
and the estimated savings from effective procurement are
substantial. Until recently, the procurement system was
over-regulated, focused heavily on the administrative
function, and based primarily on legal regulations. The
key challenges are to consolidate the current system and
to target more areas. Especially important is continued
emphasis on performance outcomes. Because the risk
of waste and corruption in procurement systems is high,
procurement reform and monitoring can yield substantial
gains for the economy and society.

Managing medium-term fiscal pressures
62. Health and pension spending will rise as the
population ages and experiences an epidemiological
transition. Age-related public spending needs will materialize alongside demands for filling the existing gaps in
the country’s social security and social protection system
(refer to Mexico Policy Note 10). Over the next two decades the population 65 years of age and older is projected
to double as a share of total population (Figure 13). This
demographic transition is expected to lead to an increase of
public spending on pension and old-age income provisions
by about one percent of GDP over this period. Similarly,
health expenditure is bound to increase due to the country’s demographic and epidemiological transitions. Total
health spending is likely to grow from 6 to 8 percent of
GDP over the next two decades. Approximately half of this
increase will be on account of the public sector.
63. Mexico’s public finance depends heavily on oil
revenue, but recent high prices mask an alarming
decline in oil production. Crude oil production has

declined by 25 percent following a peak in 2004. Estimates of oil reserves and production are surrounded by
a large margin of uncertainty, though even if production
were to stabilize at the current level of 2,500 thousand
barrels per day, a growing economy would result in a
fall of oil revenue as a percent of GDP. Over the next
two decades such a stabilization of oil production could
represent a reduction of oil revenue as a percent of GDP
by 3 percentage points.
64. Declining oil revenue, increasing medium-term
health and pension spending, as well as other public
sector spending requirements call for a strengthening of tax collection. Federal tax collection in Mexico
(13.8 percent) is below the OECD average (19.2 percent).
When local taxes and social security contributions
are included, Mexico drops to last place among OECD
countries (Figure 14). Though the general features and
statutory rates of the Mexican tax system compare favorably internationally, tax collection efficiency remains
substantially below peers.
65. A large informal economy narrows the tax
base, and numerous tax loopholes and exemptions
hinder tax collection and ease tax evasion. The
Mexican tax collection agency, Servicio de Administración
Tributaria, estimates that about 77 percent of income tax
due on non-salary income is not paid, and that value-added tax evasion is 35 percent. Preferential corporate and
individual tax regimes, value-added tax exceptions, and
multiple rates complicate the tax system and facilitate
noncompliance. Exemptions, deductions, and multiple
rates generate substantial revenue losses, have the same
effect on the budget as does government spending (like
subsidies), and alter the horizontal and vertical equity of
the tax system.
66. Adopting an integrated fiscal reform that simplifies the tax system, reforms energy subsidies, and

broadens the tax base could meaningfully bolster
revenue. Reducing or withdrawing tax expenditures
would broaden the tax base and strengthen revenues. Forgone tax revenues due to these expenditures are large and
mainly regressive. Similarly, reducing public subsidies,
especially prevalent in the energy sector, would likely
enhance public revenue as well. Energy subsidies, highly
regressive in Mexico, mask resource costs. Withdrawing
them would raise revenues, avoid distorted price signals,
and help Mexico reach its climate change mitigation goals.
67. The fiscal reform should also aim at improving
equity. The Gini coefficient in Mexico has remained virtually the same before and after taxes, in contrast with European Union countries, where taxes and public transfers
substantially lower-income inequality (Figure 15). This is
partly the result of a low share of progressive income taxes
in overall tax revenues. The fiscal reform should include
a careful evaluation of its distributional impact. But the
distributional incidence of the individual fiscal measures
should be less of a concern than the overall distributional
incidence of the tax-benefit package. Energy subsidies,
VAT exemptions and zero rating are in effect non-targeted
consumption subsidies. The amount of the subsidy obtained depends on household spending on the subsidized
products, which tends to rise with income. The loss in
purchasing power for lower-income households generated
from broadening the tax base and the removal of energy
subsidies would need to be evaluated in parallel to an
increase in targeted social spending programs. Eliminating subsidies and preferential tax regimes, along with a
compensation mechanism for lower-income households,
could lead to a net benefit in the income redistribution
function of the tax-benefit system. A fiscal reform that focuses on improving the redistributive impact of taxes and
public transfers could improve citizen trust in the state,
currently lower than in other Latin American countries,
reflecting taxpayer disappointment with public service
delivery (Figure 16).

68. The high centralization of Mexico’s tax
system has reduced the incentives of subnational
governments to collect taxes. A number of subnational governments suffer from limited administrative
capacity to fulfill key tax administration functions,
while the dependence on federal transfers remains
high (90 percent of subnational public revenue).
These vertical imbalances, combined with the rise in
discretionary federal transfers, have reduced states
incentives to raise their own revenue. Property tax,
for example, is an important source of public revenue
for subnational governments in OECD countries, but
in Mexico amounts to only 0.2 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, rapidly growing subnational expenditures now
constitute more than half of total subnational public
expenditures.

69. Dependence on federal transfers increases
the volatility of subnational public finances during
periods of economic instability and puts pressure
on state public debt (Figure 17). The lack of fiscal
discipline has led to unsustainable fiscal positions in
some states. This calls for fiscal consolidation programs
that combine financing (conditional on fiscal and service
delivery targets) with technical assistance to mobilize
state revenues and improve expenditure management. It
also calls for a transparent crisis resolution mechanism
for states that fall into fiscal distress (refer to Mexico
Policy Note 11).v
The reform agenda summarized in this overview,
and described in more detail in the compendium of
policy notes, is challenging but feasible. It proposes
an integrated reform agenda that seeks to promote productivity, reduce poverty and inequality, promote green

growth, and strengthen public finances and government
efficiency. Mexico has a unique opportunity in the next
sexenio to promote inclusive and sustainable growth. But
it will require setting priorities and sharing responsibilities between the elected government and its citizens.

Annex 5. Poverty and
Shared Prosperity Trends:
The Challenge of Measuring
the Goals of Development
1. Poverty is typically understood in absolute terms,
defined in reference to a poverty line that reflects the
purchasing power sufficient to cover essential needs.
There is a broad-based consensus that reducing absolute
poverty is a worthy development goal. Along economic
growth, poverty reduction is understood as an important
development goal in itself, while whether income inequality is an important goal in its own right has been debated
for decades. In turn, this reflects at least two underlying
and related debates. In particular, how inequality evolves
over time and the impact of inequality on growth.
2. As the impact of income inequality on economic
growth, or vice versa, remains unresolved, recent policy discussions have tended to focus more on ensuring
equality of opportunities alongside protecting people from
absolute deprivation, rather than on income inequality
alone. This recent emphasis draws from the work of a
number of thinkers, including Amartya Sen, whose “capability approach”, first conceptualized in the 1980s, has
argued — in brief and at the risk of oversimplification —
for focusing on and equalizing the “capability set” or the
set of possible “functionings”, that is, the set of activities
that an individual can choose to engage in using resources
at his or her command. Defined as such, “well-being” is
understood more broadly, and the focus is on protecting
individuals from absolute deprivation and removing
disadvantages that are beyond any individual’s control.
Real income remains essential, but having the freedom to
make substantive choices also requires good health and
education. Following this approach, public policy focuses
on ensuring a fair(er) distribution of assets, economic
opportunities, and political representation.
3. The multi-dimensional aspect of this understanding of
development has warranted a more complex approach to
the measurement of well-being and progress. There are
numerous alternatives, ranging from the formulation of

composite indexes — such as the Human Development
Index, which Sen himself helped formulate — to the
monitoring of multiple development goals, as in the Millennium Development Goals.

Mexico: pioneer of poverty measurement
4. Mexico became the first country in Latin America to
adopt a Multi-dimensional Poverty Index as its official
poverty measure. The law on social development (Ley
General de Desarollo Social or LGDS) published in January 2004, had the key objective of ensuring access to
social development and the ability to fully exercise the
social rights laid out in the Mexican Constitution for the
entire population of the country. This law moved Mexico
away from a purely economic measure of well-being to
one firmly rooted in Sen’s ideas of functionings and linked
explicitly to the national Constitution, which lays out a
series of detailed social or human rights.
5. The adoption of a Multi-dimensional Poverty Index represented a significant change in how poverty was viewed in
Mexico. Up until 2008, poverty was measured in terms of
whether a person’s per capita income placed him or her
below three poverty thresholds. The lowest or most extreme
poverty line was “food poverty”, set at the value needed
to buy a basic basket of food items. According to CONEVAL, food poverty refers to those people who do not have
the purchasing power to acquire a basic food basket. As of
March 2012 the monthly food poverty line was equivalent
to Mex$1,253.41 in urban areas and Mex$865.58 in rural
areas. The second, somewhat higher poverty line is that
of “capabilities poverty”, which corresponds to the value
of income necessary to cover the basic food basket plus
basic health and education. The highest line, “patrimonio
or asset”, included additional allowances for housing and
transportation.

Multi-dimensional Poverty (MPI)
– OFFICIAL POVERTY MEASURE

6. Today Mexico measures poverty through an explicit
combination of economic well-being (income) and the
social rights of the population. In addition to per capita
income, article 36 of the LGDS spells out the social
rights whose lack would place a person in a condition of
poverty; and rights related to education, health, social
security, housing, related utilities and infrastructure, food
security, and social cohesion. Importantly, these are all
social development rights that are outlined in the Mexican
Constitution although the level of detail of each of these
rights in the Constitution varies: education was quite
explicit while the right to housing refers to a vaguer right
to “dignified and decent” housing and food security was
only guaranteed for children.
7. Operationalizing the social rights into indicators that
could be measured and monitored and establishing a

threshold was a substantial undertaking that drew in a
wide spectrum of government and civil society. The extensive process was led by the National Council on Evaluation (CONEVAL) in partnership with line ministries, other
agencies of government, and academia. Critical decisions
had to be made not just on the indicators to include, but
the levels below which a person should be considered
poor (establishing thresholds). And most troublesome was
the need to develop a consensus around an aggregation
strategy: whatever combination of multiple indicators is
done implies comparative evaluations of the importance
of each right.
8. The official Multi-dimensional Poverty Index is conceived of as a two-dimensional indicator with economic
well-being (measured by income) seen as one dimension,
separate from the other dimension of social rights. By

this construction, per capita income is included in the
measure as almost an independent measure while a series
of six rights (or in their absence, deprivations) are aggregated in the second dimension. While income remained
as part of the poverty measure, its definition has changed
along with the thresholds in use. (These changes can be
seen in Table 1).
9. The implications of the move to a Multi-dimensional
Poverty Index is that government policies that focus purely on income growth only will, in all likelihood, be insufficient for poverty eradication, and the poverty reducing
impact of government investment in services is now
reflected in the official poverty measure. For persons to
be considered poor in multi-dimensional terms, they have
income below the monthly well-being line (i.e., income
poverty) and have at least one deprivation in terms of
housing, infrastructure, education, health, social security,
or food security. An extremely poor person has income
below the minimum well-being line and suffers from three
or more deprivations. Thus, income poverty alone does
not make one poor nor can income growth alone move one
out of poverty.
10. The Multi-dimensional Poverty Index also calls
attention to the vulnerable population. Anyone who has
adequate income but suffers three or more deprivations
is considered to be vulnerable in terms of social deprivations. Those with inadequate income but having all of their
social rights complete are considered to be vulnerable in
terms of income. In 2012 the share of the population
in extreme poverty was 9.8 percent of the population, an
additional 35.7 percent suffered from moderate poverty.
The total share in poverty in 2012 was 45.5 percent, a decline from 2010 when it was 46.1 percent but represents
still an increase in 0.5 million additional people.

The World Bank measures of
poverty and shared prosperity
11. The World Bank retains a uni-dimensional measure of
poverty, income, or consumption, but argues strongly that
poverty is a multi-dimensional phenomena, as its thorough
World Development Indicators testify. In spite of these
efforts, the World Bank is probably best known for the
economic well-being measure of poverty — the widely
used metric of “one-dollar-a-day” poverty line. The origin
of the line comes from work done for the 1990 World Development Report on Poverty. The aim of this work was to
measure poverty in the developing world using standards
of the poorest countries. A critical step for such an exercise was the determination of which poverty threshold to
use. The line observed in cross-country studies caught the
imagination and became the one-dollar-a-day line used
often in comparative work across countries and the object
of the first Millennium Development Goal. The original
work has been updated multiple times: the most recent
version sets the value to $1.25; but the overall logic and
focus is the same.
12. The recent move to a concept of shared prosperity
reflects, in part, the World Bank’s concern with broader
concepts than average economic growth. Interestingly,
although the terms appear to be similar, there has been
substantial evolution of thinking about poverty at the
World Bank. In 1972, then president of the World Bank,
Robert McNamara, stressed the need for governments of
the developing countries “... to reorient their development
policies in order to attack directly the personal poverty of
the most deprived 40 percent of their populations.” In
2013, Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, called
for attention to be paid to the income growth of the bottom
40 percent of the population. The difference is that in the
1972 case the discussion focused simply on the need to
eradicate absolute poverty, while the 2013 emphasis is on
the notion of shared prosperity and the need for growth to
be pro-poor and inclusive.

Recent poverty trends
13. Monetary poverty rose between 2006 and
2012, breaking a decade-long trend of poverty
reduction in Mexico. Available data spanning two
decades of monetary measures of poverty show that monetary poverty rates in 2012 are similar to the rates in 1992:
the net reduction of moderate and extreme poverty was of
only 0.8 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively, over 20
years (Figure 2).
14. Between 2006 and 2012 the moderate poverty rate
(asset poverty or pobreza de patrimonio) increased
substantially from 42.9 to 52.3 (to 61.4 million people).
During the same period, the extreme poverty rate (food
poverty or pobreza alimentaria) increased from 14.0 to
19.7 (to 23.1 million people). Poverty increased markedly

the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index increased by half
a million people over the same period. In contrast to
monetary measures and other Multi-dimensional Poverty
Index measures of poverty such as moderate poverty and
vulnerability measures, only extreme poverty had an
unambiguous improvement in relative and absolute terms.
Not only did the extreme poverty rate declined from 11.3 to
9.8 percent, but also the number of extreme poor decreased
by 1.4 million people (Table 2).

16. The average population with three or more social
deprivations dropped from 28.2 to 23.9 in 2012 (Table
2), and the share of population with social deprivations fell unambiguously in five out of the six social
areas in the 2010-12 period (Table 3). The largest
statistically significant improvement was in access
to health care, where 8.2 million more people gained
access. The only social deprivation for which the
share of the population increased was access to social
security (totaling 71.8 million without access to social
security). However, the net increase is not statistically
significant (Table 3).

between 2006 and 2008 (5 percentage points in moderate
poverty), with smaller increases in 2008-10 and leveling-off in 2010-12. Extreme poverty increased significantly during the period 2006-08 (when the headcount
increased by 4.7 percentage points) and stagnated in
the years after, hovering around 19 percent. Until 2006,
Mexico kept pace with the region in poverty reduction.
Nevertheless, since 2008 the economy suffered a series
of shocks — food price crisis, global financial crisis, the
AH1N1-flu epidemic, natural disasters — that slowed
economic growth.

Shared Prosperity in Mexico
17. For the period 2010-12, Mexico’s income growth for
the bottom 40 percent had an average annual increase
of 2.3 percent while the increase in the average income
growth for the total population was 0.6 percent. (Figure 3)
The increase was not enough to compensate the drop that
occurred between 2008 and 2010, when income growth
of the bottom 40 percent decreased slightly more than
the total population (2.39 percent versus 2.89 percent).
Therefore, looking at the entire period 2008-12, the average income growth of the bottom 40 percent was negative
(but the decline was less pronounced than for the overall
population).

15. Multi-dimensional Poverty Index shows, however, that
between 2010 and 2012 the share of the population living
in poverty decreased from 46.1 to 45.5. In absolute terms,
poverty increased: the total number of poor according to

18. Over the 2008-12 period, per capita income growth
hovered around zero for almost all income percentiles in
Mexico. Only the richest percentile suffered a decreased
larger than 2 percent. However, the incidence of growth had
different natures within sub-periods. While in 2008-10, the
poorest segments were the most affected; in 2010-12 they
were benefited the most in the recovery, which explains the
drop in inequality during the last years.

rose between 2006 and 2008 (Figure 7 combines the two
series). While there are comparability issues between the
old and the new series, the new income measure shows
that income inequality rose between 2006 and 2010 but
then dropped in 2012. However, the latter drop is not
statistically significant. More time and data is needed to
tell if the trend will continue.

19. These recent trends in shared prosperity are accompanied by a reduction of income inequality for the period
2010-2012. According to the income measure from the
poverty indicator prior to the adoption of the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index, income inequality had fallen
since 1996. The new income variable used as part of the
Multi-dimensional Poverty Index shows that inequality

state with the highest moderate poverty rate was Chiapas
(74.7 percent), followed by Guerrero (69.7 percent), Puebla (64.5 percent) and Oaxaca (61.9 percent). In contrast,
the states with the lowest moderate poverty rates in 2010
were Nuevo Leon (23.2 percent), Coahuila (27.9 percent)
and Distrito Federal (28.9 percent).
21. If looking at extreme poverty measures, national
average hides important regional differences. Chiapas,
Guerrero, and Oaxaca have extreme poverty rates of 32.2,
31.7, and 23.2 percent, respectively. These are 10 times
higher than the poverty rates of Nuevo Leon, Distrito
Federal, and Baja California (2.4, 2.5, and 2.7, respectively). One out of 3 Mexicans in poverty live in Chiapas,
Guerrero, or Oaxaca.
22. There are also large regional discrepancies in terms
of shared prosperity in Mexico. While the mean income of
the bottom 40 percent in Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz
had an average growth above 8 percent between 2010 and
2012, in the states of Nayarit mean income decreased by
8 percent (Figure 5).

Gender and ethnicity differences
23. Gender-specific estimates of poverty indicate differences between women and men. From 2010 to 2012,
the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index extreme poverty
rate was equally reduced among men and females by
1.5 percentage points. However, in 2012, there were 1.5
million fewer men than women living in moderate poverty.
Moreover, 300,000 more women than men live in extreme
poverty (left, Figure 6).
24. Poverty among the indigenous population has fallen
faster, but their poverty levels remain high. Extreme
poverty among indigenous population decreased 7.2
percentage points, lifting more than 800,000 people out
of poverty. Despite this progress, 8.2 million indigenous
people still live in poverty, 3.5 million of whom are
extremely poor (right, figure 6). The social deprivation indicator fell in each dimension among indigenous groups.
In particular, they had a large improvement in access to
healthcare for which 1.3 million gained access.

Annex 6. Status of Gender
Issues in Mexico and
Entry Points to the CPS
1. In the last decade, much progress has been made
toward greater gender equality in Mexico. On the one
hand, issues such as equal treatment, non-violence, equal
law and rights, public expenditure, awareness of unpaid
household work, and political participation have all been
incorporated into the public agenda. On the other hand,
Mexico shows improved gender outcomes in several areas:
between 2005 and 2010 the average level of schooling
went up from 7.9 to 8.4 for women and from 8.4 to 8.7
for men, and the proportion of women in the House of
Deputies has increased from 17.4 percent in 2000 to 36.8
percent in the current administration.
2. The improved gender outcomes may be related to the
significant increase in the allocation of public funds in
the last 10 years in which the budget dedicated to gender equality has multiplied by 13.3. Also, the Federal
Government has enacted several laws to protect women’s
rights.43 The process of guaranteeing the rights granted by
these federal laws is solidified through adoption of similar
laws and regulations at the state level.
3. However, despite progress in promulgation of laws
and increases in budgets aimed to enhance gender
equality, major issues still need to be addressed. Challenges remain on education, health (i.e., access to health
services and maternal mortality rates); opportunities for
income generation (i.e., labor markets and occupational
segregation, access to assets and financial services, use
of time); poverty levels; and women agency and gender
roles (i.e., adolescent pregnancy, gender-based violence,
and political participation).

Ending Poverty
4. Overall, gender-specific estimates of poverty suggest
that there are no big differences between women and men.

Analyzing gender poverty is a complex task because incomes as well as inputs into multi-dimensional definitions
of poverty are generally measured at the household level,
but there are estimates that 52 percent of women live in
conditions of multi-dimensional poverty, compared to 48
percent of men.44
5. However, estimates of time poverty show noteworthy
differences with a higher incidence in women than in
men. Women dedicate more time to unpaid activities,
both in and outside of the household. Estimates suggest
that 62.9 percent of women and 7.1 percent of men
aged 15 to 64 live in conditions of time poverty. In
rural areas 76.5 percent of women live in time poverty
conditions, compared to 59.6 percent in urban areas.
For men the numbers are 5.8 percent and 7.6 percent
respectively.
6. Maternal mortality is also a persistent public health
issue in Mexico; progress on this issue has been very slow
with 60 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2002 and only
down to 51 in 2010. To improve maternal health, several
measures are recommended: (a) ensure that necessary
resources are available to send women to specialized
hospitals in case of emergency at the local level; (b)
the quality of medical attention should be improved; (c)
training for medical personnel at a municipal level should
encompass detection of risk factors; and (d) increased
resources should be spent for prevention measures such
as prenatal consultations.
7. Between 2006 and 2011 the incidence of violence
against women perpetrated in their last relationship
increased from 43.2 percent to 46.1 percent. Large percentages of women (64.6 percent of separated, divorced,
or widowed women; 70.7 percent of single; and 75.1 percent of married or common-law wives) do not denounce
physical or sexual abuse by their partner or spouse. These

PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY FOR
THE UNITED
MEXICAN
STATES

123

results demonstrate that violence against women has
grown in its every form, in spite of public action to combat
it.

Shared Prosperity
8. Gender differences also persist in the labor market,
which is still highly dominated by men. In 2010, for
example, the economically active population rate for
women reached 44 percent while it was 81 percent for
men. Women are more likely to work in the informal sector: in 2012, 31.6 percent of women and 28.4 percent of
men worked in the informal sector. Also, the occupational
segregation is another challenge for women’s position in
the labor market.
9. Inequality permeates Mexican society and analysis
of gender differences within states reveals that not all
the states have made equal progress toward gender
equality. The level of violence against women is one
example. Another one is that rural indigenous females
have considerably lower average years of schooling
(4.5) than the general female population (8.4), and the
school attendance among indigenous women fluctuates
between 10 and 66 percent depending on the state,
while that of non-indigenous women is between 62 and
73 percent.
10. Also, in spite of increased political participation at
the federal level, the proportion of women in local congress is very low: up until 2012, only the State of Yucatán
had a female governor. These inequalities are accentuated
in municipal governments in that only 7.7 percent of all
2,285 municipalities are headed by female mayors.

11. The CPS will expand the World Bank’s ongoing
analytical and operational activities in the area. Key
efforts will be focused on assisting federal, state and municipal agencies responsible for gender issues to increase
research and analytical work and inform well-targeted
gender policies and investments. The proposed gender
work program under the CPS FY14-19 is currently under
active preparation and discussion within the country
management and sector units as well as with clients
and other stakeholders, and as such it has not yet been
possible to define gender specific parameters for the CPS
Results Matrix (Table 1). The definition of operation- and/
or activity-specific gender targets and monitoring indicators will be completed as integral part of their respective
preparation processes.
12. Some potential entry points include:
• Financial services/inclusion. Disaggregate
the number of people with bank accounts by

sex and propose ways to enhance women’s
agency in terms of financial literacy, access to
services.
• Labor force participation and formal sector
inclusion. Include a gender dimension in the
labor force discussion since fewer women than
men are economically active (44 and 81 percent,
respectively), and there is persistent occupational
segregation and gender wage gaps. Programmatic
actions could include analysis to detect gender-specific needs and demands for labor market
policies that improve the skills level, formality,
and allocative efficiency of the labor force, including the National Employment System.
• Education. There are acute differences in
education levels of indigenous and non-indigenous women; indigenous women, age 15 and
over, have an average of 4.5 years of schooling,
compared to 8.7 years among non-indigenous
women. The PEC could provide a channel to
work on this.
• Gender-based violence. This might be
something to look into further, particularly as
it is a key Government priority in the Mexico
NDP, and it relates to a nationwide monitoring
system.
• Oportunidades. In the work the Bank will
support there is mention of “a unified registry
of beneficiaries to track which families are
receiving (or not) benefits from which social
security/assistance programs”. If this registry
could collect data on an individual level (not
just family), useful data would be available for
further analysis on gender-differentiated needs
and demands.
• Green growth. World Bank engagement in
the region (and beyond) has shown that a gender-differentiated analysis of usage patterns,
demands, and payment schemes of issues such
as water management and energy diversification can provide valuable insights to create
more adequate solutions that enhance project
effectiveness.

Portfolio Review
13. A consistent incorporation of gender issues into the
World Bank’s work has proved to increase developmental
benefits. Thus, besides high impact gender specific initiatives at the State and Municipal level through existing
or new operations, the World Bank will further explore
and support ways to mainstream gender issues within its
operational work.

Annex 7. Oaxaca
Engagement: An Example of
Comprehensive Engagement
at Subnational Level
1. The State of Oaxaca faces enormous development
challenges and major institutional weaknesses. Oaxaca
is among the Mexican states with the highest levels of
poverty and the lowest levels of economic performance.
The state is characterized by a high illiteracy rate. Its
average income per capita at roughly US$3,400 is near
to that of Swaziland and Guatemala, but far from the
Mexican average of US$8,960. With a predominantly
indigenous population, Oaxaca has a highly dispersed
population spread across a highly mountainous territory.
Service delivery is complicated by numerous municipalities. There is limited budget flexibility and public sector
management is weak.

The MoU approach
2. These development challenges call for
multi-stakeholder and multi-dimensional support.
The World Bank has been supporting the reform agenda
for inclusive growth of Oaxaca through a strategic programmatic partnership since 2011. In June 2011 the
Bank and the Government of Oaxaca signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that included multi-year,
multi-sectoral support to the state, combining a package
of knowledge, convening, and financial services. These
services were structured around four areas: (a) public
sector modernization, (b) sustainable development, (c)
finance and private sector, and (d) human development.
The MoU was originally established for two years (201113) and was renewed for two additional years in June
2013 (July 2013 – June 2015).

PARTNERSHIP

THE UNITED

126

3. The approach of this partnership is similar to
a country’s CPS and represents a departure from
an operational or ESW-centric approach to sector
dialogue and development solutions. It recognizes
the need to retain long-term engagement based on agreed
objectives and development challenges not subject to the

unanticipated changes in financing and knowledge needs
in particular sectors.
4. After two years of implementation, the MoU has
proven to be a successful strategy to support the
reform agenda for the inclusive growth of Oaxaca.
The strategy has led to the following main results:
•G
 overnment counterparts have built up technical capacity in the different areas of reform
(e.g., trainings and workshops in strategic sector planning, public investment, water utility
management, forestry management).
•T
 he Bank has informed policy design and
implementation.
•R
 esources have been mobilized leveraging
co-financing of other organizations, such as
the UNDP, the MacArthur Foundation, and
Transparency International–Mexico.
•A
 concurrence of key national and local
stakeholders has been brought together to the
table to participate in a specific development
agenda.
•C
 oncrete and fundamental tools for efficient
policymaking have been generated.
5. Several outputs have been produced from this
partnership to modernize the State of Oaxaca’s
public institutions and policies: (a) design and implementation of a methodology to structure strategic sector
planning oriented to results; (b) design proposals for an
integrated public financial management and public investment management systems; (c) strengthen tax administration capacity; (d) map existing social programs, (e)
exchange good practice approaches on reducing maternal

mortality, (f) support the consolidation of rural financial
institutions, (g) exchange good practice approaches on
public-private partnerships, (h) strengthen water utility
management, (i) Atlas of Climate and Climate Change,
and (j) exchange good practice approaches on sustainable
development (see Table 1, Areas of Engagement).
6. After two years of implementation, 10 activities
have been concluded, 17 are under execution,
and 3 new activities will be initiated during FY14.
Around 70 specialists in 75 different technical missions
have been to Oaxaca, either as technical experts providing
support to policy reforms or sharing experiences in seminars and forums that have been organized to strengthen
the institutional capacity of the state.
7. Sources of funding to develop the MoU include
Bank Budget (BB), Global Environmental Facility
(GEF), Institutional Development Fund (IDF), and
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Fund
(FIRST). Development solutions to improve competitiveness and the business climate in Oaxaca have also
been explored through the Foreign Investment Advisory
Service (FIAS), a joint facility of the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) and the World Bank. The IFC has also
contributed to the promotion of public and private associations in Oaxaca.

Proposed engagement approach
during the next CPS
8. Development challenges in Oaxaca are structural and require sustained long-term support in
order to shift the current trends. The Bank and the
Government of Oaxaca will expand the Bank’s ongoing
analytical and operational activities during the next two
years. Mexico’s Ministry of Finance has also asked the
Bank to expand the Oaxaca’s thematic MoU model to

states of Guerrero and Chiapas. This support both at the
federal and state levels reinforces the Bank’s subnational
engagement.
9. A work program with Oaxaca has been prepared
and agreed for FY14-15. The MoU is composed of
20 activities, most of which are the continuation of the
work that was carried out during FY12 and FY13, and a
set of new activities has been identified to accompany the
government efforts and strengthen its agenda such as an assessment of governmental accounting harmonization status,
the development of tourism development strategies, and a
project on sustainable production systems and biodiversity.
10. Oaxaca has also expressed its interest in expanding the program with the Bank through a specific loan in the water sector. The Water and Sanitation
Sector (WSS) Modernization Program (P145578) will seek
to improve the quality and sustainability of WSS services
and WSS sector information in the State of Oaxaca.
11. The Bank will continue to provide to Oaxaca
with all the necessary information and technical advice to facilitate the participation of the state in the
federal programs that are supported by the Bank.
Specifically, Oaxaca could get technical support and the
necessary financing to improve urban transport, promote
renewable energy sources, and support rural communities
to sustainably manage their forests.
12. The Bank’s knowledge program on Oaxaca
will also be supported by Reimbursable Advisory
Services (RAS). Reimbursable advisory services are an
increasingly important way for the Bank to meet Oaxaca’s
demand through the provision of customized advisory
services. In June 2013, for example, a RAS was signed
between the Government of Oaxaca and the World Bank to
contribute to the improvement of the quality and efficiency
of the State of Oaxaca’s public expenditure management.

Endnotes
Annex 5 provides a detailed description of both Mexican and World Bank’s methodologies for measuring poverty, as well
as detailed data tables with poverty rates by state and by method.
2. One limitation of analyzing the official Multi-dimensional Poverty Index is that there are only three years with available
data: 2008, 2010, and 2012. Thus, in order to study long-term poverty trends it is necessary to use a monetary poverty
indicator, which was the previous official poverty measure in Mexico and which is still produced by CONEVAL
3.
Analysis about mobility and middle class in Mexico and the region can be found in “Economic Mobility and the Rise of the Latin American Middle Class” at http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/11/13/

4. Annex 4 includes the overview chapter of the policy notes prepared in 2011-12 by World Bank staff. The complete set
is accessible at http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mexico/research/all.
5. Annex 3 contains a section on recent economic events and the macroeconomic outlook.

Refer to “Fostering sound financial sector development”, Policy Note No.1; “Toward a more competitive business
environment”, Policy Note No. 2; “Fostering innovation for productivity and competitiveness”, Policy Note, No.3.
7. Refer to “Labor Markets for Inclusive Growth”, Mexico Policy Note No.4.
8. The OECD launched the Programme for International Student Assessment (1997) to evaluate education systems.
9. The largest insurance programs in Mexico are the Instituto Mexicano de los Seguros Sociales (IMSS), the Instituto de
Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSTE) and Régimen Estatal de Protección Social en Salud
(Seguro Popular). Refer to “Social Protection”, Mexico Policy Note No.5.
10. Gender differences in poverty, as well as additional information about gender as entry points to the CPS can be found
in Annex 5 and 6.
11. Refer to “Managing medium term fiscal challenges”, Mexico Policy Note No. 8; “Strengthening public revenue and
expenditure management to enhance service delivery”, Mexico Policy Note No. 9; and “Strengthening sub-national public
finance”, Mexico Policy Note No.10.
12. Refer to “Reducing the footprint of growth”, Mexico Policy Note No. 6; and “Using natural resources in an optimal
way”, Mexico Policy Note No. 7.

combustibles en México.
15. OP/BP 10.00 retired the use of Adaptable Program Loans in April 2013.
16. Following Mexico’s Multi-dimensional Poverty Index, the assessment identifies whether WBG interventions have a
high, average or low expected impact on income poverty or on the access to any of the basic needs that are reflected in
the multi-dimensional index (i.e., housing, infrastructure, education, health, social security and food security). A high
value represents areas where the initial expected direct impact could be on both the income side and the access to basic
needs consistent with the Mexico multi-dimensional index. In other words, this refers to strategic areas on which WBG
interventions could have a direct impact on “extreme poverty”, defined as population with monetary income below the
‘minimum welfare’ line and with at least three deprivations. An average value reflects areas where the initial impact could
be either on the income side or on the access to basic needs. Finally, a low value refers to areas that may not necessarily
have an expected direct impact on the income or the basic needs sides (i.e. a direct impact on the extreme poor).
17. Shared prosperity focuses on income growth of the bottom 40 % of the population; ‘average’ or ‘low’ indicates the
WBG’s impact on economic growth in general. ‘High’ indicates impact on specific target groups within the bottom 40%.
18. A sharp GDP contraction was largely the result of a collapse in external demand and international trade. Exports and
imports fell 13.7 percent and 18.6 percent, respectively, in 2009. Between October 2008 and June 2009, Mexico lost
almost a million jobs.
19. Between 2006 and 2010, the moderate poverty rate increased from 42.7 percent to 51.3 percent (to 57.7 million people)
and the extreme poverty rate increased from 13.8 percent to 19.8 percent (to 21.2 million people).
20. When considering economic losses due to crime, victimization surveys estimate that in 2010 alone, crime costs victims
losses of US$12.9 billion, and additional health expenses of US$619 million (INEGI Encuesta Nacional de Victimización
y Percepción sobre Seguridad Pública (ENVIPE), INEGI, Mexico (2011a, 2012b). Moreover, empirical evidence also
suggests that municipalities with higher levels of drug-related crimes in 2007 have grown at a slower pace between 2005
and 2010 than municipalities less affected by this shock (Lopez-Calva, L. F, Rodriguez-Castelan, C., and K. Scott (2012).

25. A comparative analysis of childcare programs was conducted seeking to compare international standards in the provision of childcare services to the Mexican model. Preliminary findings highlighted the fact that Programa de Estancias
Infantiles was focused on female labor force participation rather than in ECD. Recommendations to the client were
provided in order to increase the impact of the country’s program.
26. Refer to Note on Cancelled Operation (World Bank Report Number NCO 00001902).
27. Against a baseline stockpile of 1.2 million in October 2009 and equal to a target of 2.1 million by June 30, 2012.
28. Baja California Sur, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Estado de México, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Tabasco, Veracruz and Yucatán.
29.
Several factors have contributed to this situation. For instance, the increase in urbanization in Mexico places a
tremendous strain on urban services, such as the urban transport and electricity networks. Water and sanitation services
are subject to the capacity of state and municipal operators and thus vary greatly in quality and coverage across regions
in Mexico.
30. Report from PROTRAM received by the World Bank on July 22, 2011.
31. Proof of this was the approval and publication of the PECC (Special Program for Climate Change) in Mexico’s official
Gazette in August 2009, which was fundamental to creating a comprehensive policy framework for reduction of emissions
across sectors.
32. Key changes in government policy include (a) delays in subsidies payments and in decision-making processes in the
funding and operation of the government-sponsored mortgage agencies; (b) shift from horizontal to vertical housing, which
requires more working capital for homebuilders; and (c) additional government requirements for homebuilders to offer
sustainable housing.
33. The sector strategy goal is to achieve 12 GW of wind generation by the year 2020.
34. The package of advisory and analytical work included (a) just-in-time advice to SEDESOL on the strategy to promote
local and regional socio-economic development in the southern states of Mexico, enhancing the capacity of the poorest
states and municipalities to pursue green growth; (b) an SFLAC fund to design municipal indices and a sustainable local
development guide that enhanced policy dialogue and included policy actions targeting sustainable territorial development at the municipal level; and (c) a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) exercise that helped enhance the quality
of the DPL operation by providing critical analysis and a strong foundation for a more effective and informed engagement
on climate change adaptation for poverty reduction.
35. The SINAVE index comprises measures for three of its four sub-systems, including nine different elements, as follows:
(1) the system for the weekly notification of reportable diseases; (2) the sentinel health facility surveillance system; (3) the
surveillance system for acute flaccid paralysis; (4) the surveillance system for acute febrile illness; (5) the surveillance
system for HIV/AIDS; (6) the surveillance system for diabetes; (7) the surveillance system for neural tube defects; (8) the
registry system for malignant neoplasms, and (9) the surveillance system for addictions. Examples of indicators for these
elements include: the percentage of medical centers reporting cases in a timely manner, the number of consecutive weeks
of reporting, the number of notified cases of specific diseases among children, the percentage of samples drawn according
to standards and percentage of probable cases tested in a timely manner. Data for these indicators is provided by health
facilities, sentinel sites and laboratories across the country and consolidated by the SINAVE at the federal level.
36. This compendium does not discuss economic and social challenges related to citizen security. Parallel research efforts are
being launched to shed light on trends of citizen insecurity and their implications for inclusive and sustainable growth in Mexico.
37. In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted GDP per capita.
38. Evidence based on the US manufacturing sector shows that increasing an industry’s intensity in R&D by 1 percentage
point increases the growth rate of output per worker in that industry by between 0.08-0.16 percentage points (Zachariadis,
2003).
39. The middle class headcount is the number of individuals with daily incomes between 10 and 50 dollars (in 2005 US
dollar, PPP terms). They fall approximately between the 66th percentile to 98th percentile in the household survey (World
Bank, 2012b).
40. Environmental Indicators (UNEP 2007).
41. There are a number of measures that identify and emphasize different aspects of the environment such as resource
exhaustion, pollution, or impacts on health and economic activity
42. For example, Ley General para la Prevención y Gestión Integral de los Residuos y su Reglamento y sus Normas
Oficiales Mexicanos; Programa Nacional para la Prevención y Gestión Integral de los Residuos 2009-2012. Secretaría de
Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT).
43.
Examples are Federal Law to Prevent and Eliminate Discrimination (LGPED-2003), the General Law on Equality between Men and Women (LGIMH-2006), and the General Law on Women’s Access to a Life Free of Violence
(LGAMVLV-2007)
