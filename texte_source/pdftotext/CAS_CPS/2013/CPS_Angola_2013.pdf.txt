EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.
This World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Angola covering
Fiscal Years 2014-2016, the first in nearly 4 years, comes at an important juncture in
Angola's development history of transitioning to shared prosperity. After emerging from a
devastating 27-year civil war in 2002, the country has to date achieved a period of remarkable
reconstruction and recovery and fast economic growth. As a result of the sharp rise in per capita
income which surpassed the eligibility threshold for IDA resources for several years, Angola will
be transitioning at the end of FY14 to a middle-income IBRD country. The CPS was prepared to
support that transition and to define areas that could be supported with a new set of instruments,
among which knowledge takes the center stage.
2.
There are significant challenges remaining from the earlier period of reconstruction
which need to be addressed to lift Angola's development effort to a higher plane. Despite
the rapid growth, particularly fueled by the development of Angola's oil and gas sector, large
pockets of the population still remain in poverty and without adequate access to basic services.
Taking into account Angola's high population growth rate and existing income and service
access disparity across different regions and population groups, there is a clear need for a more
inclusive development policy and shared prosperity.
3.
Recognizing this need, the Government has emphasized the need for economic
diversification, equitable distribution of wealth, and better service delivery in its mediumterm National Development Plan. The 2008 economic crisis which significantly slowed the
pace of economic growth and public investments served as a reminder of the risks of Angola's
overwhelming dependency on the oil industry. The successful completion of the economic
adjustment program supported by an IMF Standby Arrangement now provides Angola with a
more stable environment in which a strong shift in development orientation could be
implemented.
4.
Capacity constraints continue to impede progress on diversification and human
development. Angola is not likely to meet any of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015,
and ranks very low on human development and business environment indicators. Although the
non-oil sector has performed better in recent years, there are still overbearing bureaucratic
hurdles and governance challenges that inhibit growth of the private sector. Despite large public
investments in expanding the social infrastructure for key public services, lack of human
resources to run the facilities efficiently has prevented more rapid improvements in education
and health outcomes.
5.
The availability of large revenues from oil provides Angola with the ability to
accelerate its development trajectory. The Government recognizes that such a financial
cushion will shrink over time as oil and gas resources are gradually depleted. Therefore, it is
placing a heavy emphasis on building human resources capable of sustaining a more diversified
economy that leads to poverty reduction.
v

6.
Responding to the above challenges and prepared with significant local
consultations and strong Government ownership, the World Bank Group's CPS aims at:
(1) supporting integrated national economic diversification through timely knowledge and
technical assistance support on spatially balanced rural development, energy sector expansion
and development, and private and financial sector development; (2) enhancing the quality of
services in education, health, and water and sanitation, and deepening the protection of the
vulnerable and marginalized citizens; and (3) building adequate human and institutional capacity
to enable sound economic management, develop skills needed in a diversifying economy, and to
build resilience to potential shocks from the global economy or climate change. Gender and
governance dimensions underpin the support the WBG will provide to Angola under the CPS.
7.
The WBG's program will make use of a range of financial and advisory instruments
available from IBRD, IFC, and MIGA, as well as knowledge services from the World Bank
Institute (WBI), to support poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The program will
include Analytical and Advisory Activities under each of the two Pillars and Foundation Plank of
the CPS, including a number of technical assistance activities to be funded through reimbursable
advisory services (RAS). Where there is a clearly defined need, the WBG will also be ready to
provide longer-term support through various financial products from IBRD, IFC, and MIGA to
leverage private investments and to lower the cost of financing Angola's long-term development.
8.
Partnership among the Bank, IFC, MIGA and WBI, as well as with key
development partners, has deepened during the preparation of the CPS. The synergistic
benefits of such partnerships were already recognized by the Government as a key potential
strength of the WBG as Angola's development partner who can offer a package of support
tailored to the country's needs at different stages of investment and reforms to promote shared
prosperity. A Finance Partners mission and workshop in Luanda planned for September 2013
will further unpack how the WBG arms can work as One Bank to achieve better results to meet
Angola's development challenges.
9.
Risks to the CPS remain substantial, however, owing to the depth of existing
disparity in Angola and the capacity gaps that impede the pace of reform implementation.
High dependency on Angola's oil sector, which constitutes about half of GDP, is another
vulnerability in case the demand or price of oil drops significantly. The flip-side of this risk is
that an oil boom could divert resources from investment to consumption and reduce the
Government's commitment to structural reforms. A downturn in economic activity arising from
a variety of domestic and external factors could lead to a surge in public frustration over the
existing disparity and distortions. The proposed CPS constitutes a calibrated engagement to
mitigate these risks by promoting measures to reduce poverty and to achieve shared prosperity.
There is a shared ownership of the priorities contained in the CPS within Government and the
WBG. The Mid-term Review of the CPS will provide an opportunity to reassess Government's
interest and commitment, and to adjust the program content accordingly.

FY14-16 COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR
THE REPUBLIC OF ANGOLA
I. INTRODUCTION

1.
This proposed new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of the World Bank Group
covering the period FY14 to FY16 comes at an important juncture in Angola's
development history in transitioning to shared prosperity. Angola is an oil producing country
of about 20 million inhabitants and a 2012 GNI per capita of US$4,580. It achieved an
impressive recovery from the 27-year civil war and is now looking to build a prosperous future.
Strong progress has been made in economic management and public finance, infrastructure
development, and expansion of key services. GDP grew at an average rate of 11 percent between
2002 and 2011. Sustained investment in oil and gas sectors yielded a steady stream of resource
revenues which were used in rehabilitating transport, energy, and social infrastructure.
2.
By contrast, progress on governance, basic services delivery and income distribution
has been mixed. Progress has been made, at times slowly, in the broad area of governance and
transparency, especially in regards to budgetary management and economic governance. Yet, in
relative terms globally, Angola still ranks extremely low on various country rankings for these
indicators. There is also a sense in recent times of a constricting space for some non-state actors,
especially civil society, while delivery of basic services (water and health in particular) is still
below average standards for Sub-Sahara Africa.
3.
Economic diversification, equitable distribution of wealth, and better service
delivery emerged as Government's medium-term priorities. Angola faces many challenges in
counteracting the distortions caused by its heavy dependence on oil, and in reducing disparity in
living standards. Overall growth has not been as inclusively shared as it could have been, with
marked disparities in regional poverty headcount persisting across the country.' The Authorities
seem increasingly aware of these realities and are trying to respond by allocating more budgetary
resources to achieve shared prosperity.
4.
There is a strong commitment on the part of the Government of Angola (GoA) to
deepen its engagement with the World Bank Group (WBG). Since the Board last discussed
the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Angola in April 2007, GoA/WBG dialogue went through a
period of low intensity, with limited lending and AAA and reduced Country Office presence,
while Angola developed other new partnerships. As new WBG operations that have been
prepared with stronger client buy-in are being implemented, a stronger cooperation has resumed,
particularly during the preparation of this Strategy. This CPS, prepared jointly with GoA more
than twenty years after the first and only full Country Assistance Strategy (1991), is in part about
building a foundation for a renewed and stronger collaboration.

Poverty headcount declined from 62 percent in 2001 to 37 percent in 2009 but is still high in rural areas at 58
percent. Gini coefficient shows high inequality at 0.55.

1

5.
At its core, this WBG Strategy is designed to support Angola's transition to MiddleIncome Country status by: supporting its largely own financed ongoing efforts for a more
integrated economic diversification beyond abundant oil; at improving its delivery of basic
services; and by supporting its longer term institutional and human resource capacities. As such,
the strategy has a knowledge-centric focus to support the Government in the management of
Angola's own considerable resources, and for deepening efforts at shared prosperity for the
citizens. The effectiveness of this CPS should be judged on whether it plays a modestly catalytic
role in orienting the course of Angola's national development towards one that is more
regionally balanced and durably self-sustaining.
II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A. IMPACT OF PROLONGED CONFLICT
6.
Armed conflict characterized recent Angolan history for over 35 years, with preIndependence armed conflict and civil war that left the country in shambles with weak state
capacity, some of the world's worst human development indicators, and massive infrastructure
destruction.2 By 2002 when peace was restored, a large part of the country's population had been
dislocated from rural areas to urban centers, most of them unskilled due to interrupted schooling.
Education levels were very low and institutional capacity was very weak.

Average GDP growth during the civil war was only 2 percent, 3 with negative growth
recorded between 1990 and 1993. Oil revenues, averaging 37 percent of GDP, financed the war
and some limited public services in accessible areas. Hyperinflation ensued owing to the
monetization of chronic fiscal deficit, with average inflation between 1991 and 2000 reaching
1043 percent. 4 Agricultural production which had thrived before Independence declined
Over a third of the roads and bridges and 70 percent of the three existing railway lines were destroyed, and the
three main ports became dilapidated without required maintenance.

8.
The social costs of the internal conflict were very high. Some 750,000 Angolans (7%
of the population) died from conflict-related causes; over 4 million people were internally
displaced; and 440,000 became refugees. Among the most vulnerable were the rural population,
female heads of households, children, persons with disability, and ex-combatants. About one in
four Angolan children died before their fifth birthday, 90 percent of whom perished due to
malaria, diarrhea or respiratory tract infections. In terms of education, primary school enrollment
was very low at 56 percent, and suffered from late entries into school and high repetition and
drop-out rates.
9.
After the Peace Agreement of 2002, the Government initiated a program of
reconstruction aided by oil resources and bilateral aid. The Government's ambitious
reconstruction effort proved difficult to implement given the shortage of a skilled labor force and
the lack of inputs. Local employment generation was limited to low paying jobs or in the
informal sector as most reconstruction labor came from abroad. The demand for non-tradable
goods rose sharply and prices soared in general in light of domestic scarcities.
B. RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
10.
Angola has maintained political stability since the end of the civil war. The new
Constitution adopted in February 2010 established a presidential parliamentary system. Under
the new system, President is no longer elected by direct popular vote, but instead the head of the
party winning the most seats in Parliament becomes President. The 2010 Constitution sets a limit
of two five-year presidential terms effective from the 2012 election.
11.
Parliamentary elections were held under the new Constitution in August 2012.
Movimento Popular de Libertaqdo de Angola (MPLA) won 175 out of 220 seats, receiving over
72 percent of the votes. As a result, the incumbent Jose Eduardo dos Santos was sworn in as
President together with Vice President Manuel Vicente, former head of the state oil company,
Sonangol. Unido Nacional para a Independ6ncia Total de Angola (UNITA) is the main
opposition party with 32 parliamentary seats, while Converg6ncia Ampla de Salvaqdo de Angola
(CASA-CE) and Partido de Renovaqdo Social (PRS) won 8 and 3 seats respectively.
12.
Following the elections, the newly constituted Government worked quickly to
operationalize the MPLA elections manifesto "enhancing growth and distributing better"
into National Development Plan, 2013-2017 which focuses on poverty reduction, eradication of
hunger, accelerated infrastructure development, assistance to young entrepreneurs, and better
access to education and vocational training.
13.
The prospects for rule of law and peace are good. Progress is being made in ending
armed conflict in the country, including in the oil-rich province of Cabinda where the Armed
Cabinda separatists Frente de Libertaqjo do Enclave de Cabinda (FLEC) have fought for
independence since 1975. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between the

discontinued the monetary financing of fiscal deficit.

3

Government and a faction of FLEC in 2006 seeking to bring a formal end to the conflict.
However, sporadic attacks on Government and other members of the society are still common.
C. POVERTY AND INEQUALITY
14.
The poverty headcount in Angola decreased from an estimated 62 percent in 2001'
to 37 percent by 2009.6 The national poverty line was set at 4,793 kwanzas per month, which
translated to about US$2.00 per day during the 2008/09 survey period. The lowest level of
poverty is found in the capital Luanda, with 8.6 percent, while the highest level of headcount
poverty is found in the South Center region of the country, with 54.8 percent.' Extreme poverty
is more pronounced in rural areas and inland provinces to the east, highlighting Angola's
remaining challenges for reducing absolute poverty and enhancing shared prosperity.

15.
Inequality is also high, with a Gini coefficient of 0.55. According to IBEP, it is
estimated that 60 percent of the income (and 50 percent of consumption) is concentrated among
the richest 20 percent of the population compared with about 3 percent of the income (and 5
percent of consumption) that is shared by the lowest 20 percent. On average, food consumption
is equivalent to near 60 percent of household expenditure among the poorest 20 percent of the
population and up to near 70 percent of those living in rural areas. The survey also found that
about 80 percent of interviewed households had suffered from at least one shock during the
previous year (lack of seeds due to market fluctuation, drought and illness or death of a member,
crop infestation, and rising food prices). In addition, the unequal access of women to land and

2001 was pervasive, with 94 percent in the rural areas and 57 percent in urban areas being poor.

Survey on the Welfare of the Population (IBEP), conducted in 18 provinces during 2008 and 2009.

INE is currently trying to establish a comparison for both surveys (at least in the areas where they overlap).

other factors has been a constraint for increasing agriculture incomes.
16.
Poverty in rural areas is further compounded by the limited access to social services,
especially for women and rural population. IBEP reports that only 24 percent of rural
households had access to clinics within 2 kms, compared to 63 percent in urban areas. Some 86
percent of women in the poorest income quintile gave birth at home whereas 73 percent in the
richest quintile gave birth at health facilities. Children in rural areas have 50 percent higher
probability of dying before age 5 than those in urban areas. IBEP also revealed significantly
lower mortality among children whose mothers had received education. However, more than 70
percent of rural population is said to be illiterate. Lack of progress in transparency and
governance in public financial management is a constraint for improving service delivery.
D. MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGs), GENDER, AND REGIONAL DISPARITY
17.
Angola's civil conflict had a major impact in delaying the achievement of the MDG
targets. The country is not likely to meet any of the MDG targets by 2015. Nevertheless, as a
post-conflict country, Angola made reasonable progress in the areas of poverty reduction,
primary education, and gender equality. Despite the progress made since 2002, social indicators
remain very poor. Life expectancy at birth is 51.1 years, with a high probability of 38.5 percent
of not surviving to age 40. The maternal mortality ratio at 450 per 100,000 births is among the
highest in Sub-Saharan Africa.
18.
Malnutrition is acute with about 30 percent of children under age 5 suffering from
stunting and 16 percent being underweight. One in five children dies before their fifth
birthday, of which 90 percent die as a result of malaria, diarrhea, or respiratory tract infections.
Almost half of the country's population does not have access to drinkable water and sanitation,'
the lack of which is a major cause of gastrointestinal diseases.
19.
Progress has been made regarding the number of HIV infected persons who are on
anti-retroviral-treatment. Progress has also taken place in malaria control, with a significant
reduction in morbidity and mortality. The TB program has expanded the Directly Observed
Treatment Strategy (DOTS) to the provinces through 2,400 events benefitting from HIV/AIDS,
malaria, and TB prevention programs.
20.
Education is an important channel for poverty reduction and the achievement of
shared prosperity. The 2008/09 IBEP reports that poverty incidence is high at 62 percent for
households whose heads received no education, whereas just 14 percent of the households whose
heads received secondary education or above were poor. Access to education has improved
steadily, but it has proved more difficult to keep children in school and complete a full cycle of
primary education. As in other post-war countries, Angola's education system went through a
catch up phase whereby older children who have not gone to school before enrolled in primary
schools. Indeed, primary school enrollment increased by 11 percent per year between 2002 and
2010 with the number of students enrolled rising from 1.8 million to 4.2 million. However, grade
6 completion rate is below Sub-Saharan average at 35 percent.
Access to water and sanitation services have also been strengthened, with access to improved water services
delivered through house connections and rehabilitated standpipes increasing.

GENDER EQUALITY

21.

The role assumed by women has been crucial in Angola during the prolonged

conflict. Men went to fight in the war while women tended to livelihood in their communities.
At the end of the war, a considerable number of widowed women had to take more

6

responsibilities in all areas in the society not only to sustain families but also to support the
rehabilitation of local communities (OECD-SIGI).9 These circumstances brought changes in
gender roles (Fonseca et. 2001). 1 Currently, women sometimes play roles that traditionally were
dominated by men. Even at the community level in provinces, female traditional leaders exist
and they are usually selected through an election in the community. High female labor
participation is attributed to this unique gender aspect in Angola.
22.
The feminization of agriculture and women's land access issues contribute to food
insecurity and rural poverty, according to the 2008 Country Gender Profile (CGP) produced
by the African Development Bank. The Government has made efforts to promote gender equality
and the rights of women but challenges remain. The Constitution of Angola guarantees equal
rights for men and women. Equal access to land is provided for in the law as is the protection
from domestic violence (2011). However, almost 40% of the women in Angola report aggression
from their husbands or partners and land distribution follows the traditional rules that favor men.
Angola improved its Gender Gap Index from 0.604 in 2006 to 0.662 in 2011. The political
empowerment of women has made a remarkable progress rising from 0.07 points in 2006 to 0.29
points in 2011. This increase resulted from an improvement in the number of seats held by
women in the National Parliament, which rose from 20.6 percent in 2002 to 44 percent in 2009."
Today, Angola has one of the highest shares of women MPs in the region.
23.
In spite of significant steps in female's empowerment, in practice, women are still
disadvantaged in a number of ways. Education and health gender metrics have been
improving, but areas of concern include female mortality, gaps in earnings and productivity, and
effective voice in the household. Fertility rate was still very high at 5.6 children per woman of
child-bearing age in 2009 (WB Gender Stats, 2009). Although women's participation in the labor
force is high at 76% for the adult population (WB Gender Stats, 2009), there is a significant
gender gap in earning. According to the 2010 WB Enterprise Surveys, women are more likely to
own smaller businesses than men. Women are also more likely to be working in low-productivity
agricultural activities. Acknowledging the challenges above, the Government values gender
equity as a requirement for achieving poverty reduction and shared prosperity in a sustainable
manner (Angop, 2011).12
REGIONAL DISPARITY

24.
A number of surveys show growing regional, as well as urban/rural, disparity over
the last decade in Angola. In terms of income per capita, 3 Luanda ranks highest with an
average of US$8,783 per person in 2007, while 10 of the 18 provinces had an average income
below US$1,000. Just over 51 percent of Luanda residents had access to improved water and 84
percent connected to electricity grid, while in provinces with worst conditions, access to water
and electricity were 6.6 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively. (See Annex 4 for a discussion on
constraints to shared prosperity)

25.
The Angolan economy reliance on oil has deepened. Oil production, which currently
accounts for about 50 percent of GDP, more than doubled its output from 0.8 million barrels per
day in 2003 to 1.7 million in 2011. With the end of violent conflict, agricultural production and
the non-oil sector recovered strongly, but agricultural productivity remains low due to its
subsistence nature. Non-oil sectors - besides construction and some services - face many
challenges due to lack of competitiveness.
26.
The existing constraints to shared prosperity are to a large extent a product of the
prolonged war. The IBEP (2011) documents the high migration from provinces to the capital
city of Luanda during the initial phase of the war (1975-1992). At the peak of the influx into
Luanda, some 38 percent of the city inhabitants were said to have moved from other parts of the
country. Today, this figure is still significant at 30.5 percent. The poorest quintile of the
households reported the war to be the main reason for migration (39 percent), and very small
share of them migrated in search of work (3 percent) or schooling (1 percent).
27.
The structure of the economy has changed gradually with the intensification of oil
and mining activities in the last 25 years. Agriculture and fisheries constituted 11 percent of
GDP in 2010, compared to 9 percent in 1985. Industrial sectors, comprised of oil and gas,
mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction, grew in importance with their combined GDP
share rising from 53 percent in 1985 to 57 percent by 2010-14 Despite showing strong growth
after the war, services lost GDP share to 32 percent in 2010, down from 37 percent in 1985.
Overall, the GDP nearly quadrupled during the same period. More than 50 percent of Angolan
workers are engaged in agriculture and fisheries - some 3.15 million out of a 6.2 million
workforce in 2010 (Figure 4). Industrial sectors employ about 10 percent, while service sectors
provide 39 percent of the jobs.
14

The GDP share is based on constant 2000 prices rather than using current price GDP at factor cost.

8

28.
This presents an important structural factor which accentuates income disparity
observed in Angola today. Given the under-developed social transfers mechanism, those
engaged in agriculture earn much less than those working in industries. Indeed, this shows up
rather clearly in the most recent poverty report (IBEP 2011) whereby 66.2 percent of agricultural
workers fall below the poverty line, while poverty rates among industrial- and service-sector
workers are significantly less at 19.7 and 18.4 percent, respectively. A concerted effort is needed
from all stakeholders to overcome the structural and historical constraints, and to achieve shared
prosperity.
E.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

29.
Growth slowed down significantly in recent years. Average real GDP growth of
15 percent between 2002 and 2008 fell to 3.1 percent during 2009-2011 due to the decline in
global oil prices and a contraction in domestic oil production. The resulting drop in oil revenues,
the primary source of government revenue, impacted the non-oil economy through diminished
private consumption, cuts to public spending and the accumulation of substantial arrears to
domestic firms, particularly in the construction sector.
30.
In 2008, the global financial and economic crisis was transmitted to the Angolan
economy through the drop in the price of oil and the fiscal situation began to deteriorate
rapidly. From January to October 2008 the average monthly oil revenue received by the
Government amounted to $3.2 billion. By December 2008 it had declined to $1.5 billion, falling
further to $600 million by February 2009. Since Angola's main source of fiscal revenue is
through the taxation of the oil sector, fiscal situation worsened despite efforts to reduce
expenditures. Investment expenditures which had already been contracted could not be reduced,
exacerbating the fiscal imbalances. In the face of these fiscal rigidities, the Government
borrowed domestically and from commercial banks. Shortage of financing led the Government
to incur arrears, affecting negatively the financial sector and the economy as a whole.
31.
The impact of the global crisis also worsened the current account deficit to
12 percent of GDP in 2009. Delays in floating the exchange rate led to a drastic fall of
international reserves, from around US$20 billion in November 2008 to US$12.5 billion in April
2009. As foreign exchange reserves plummeted, the demand for US dollars skyrocketed, leading
to a run on deposits and resurgence of a parallel market where the Kwanza was trading at a
30 percent discount against the dollar.
32.
Angola's economy rebounded in 2012, with GDP expanding by an estimated
8.1 percent. A combination of high oil prices and rising oil production boosted GDP growth and
generated a large increase in fiscal revenues, enabling the government to clear its arrears and
increase public expenditure. At the same time inflation declined to single digits (the first time in
more than two decades), and international reserves recovered to about US$31 billion (7 months
of imports) as the external current account turned positive.

33.
Among the most salient features of the Angolan economy are its very low levels of
investment, both public and private. Angola's total investment rate is currently about
13 percent of GDP, well below the three-year average for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) of
24 percent. Public investment accounts about 10 percent of its GDP, while private investment

10

represents just 3 percent," compared to a SSA average of 13 percent. Since the recovery began,
the authorities have taken steps to increase public investment, which rose by about 3 percent in
2011 and 17 percent in 2012. The 2013 budget calls for a steep increase of 60 percent in nominal
capital expenditures.
F. MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES
34.
Angola's overall economic outlook is positive, with GDP growth projected at
7.2 percent in 2013 and 7.5 percent in 2014. These projections are based on sustained increases
in oil production, relatively stable international oil prices, and continued growth in the non-oil
sectors, particularly construction. Net capital inflows are expected to remain solid, bolstering
foreign exchange reserves and reinforcing the government's fiscal position, while inflation is
expected to continue its gradual decline. Finally, the production of liquid natural gas (LNG),
expected to begin in 2013, could contribute an additional 2 percentage points to the GDP growth
rate during its first year alone.
35.
Despite its favorable near term outlook, Angola's reliance on oil revenues and
imports leaves the economy highly vulnerable to external shocks. Oil exports are responsible
for an overwhelming share of Angola's fiscal and external revenues, and a negative shock to
global oil prices would significantly reduce GDP growth. In addition, Angola's reliance on both
strategic and consumer-goods imports - particularly food - means that any substantial increase
in international food prices would translate into rapidly rising inflation and reduced
consumption, with a devastating effect on the country's poor.
36.
Over the medium term, rebalancing the composition of public expenditures from
current to capital spending would help to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks and boost
growth in the non-oil sectors. Current expenditures account for three-quarters of all public
spending, and over the past three years they have grown at twice the rate of capital expenditures.
Angola's fuel-subsidy costs are estimated to be the highest in SSA, reaching 5 percent of GDP in
2012 - equivalent to half of all capital spending.
37.
Strong growth of the non-oil sectors will help to reduce regional disparity. Angola
today has considerable scope to increase its agricultural production to supply domestic as well as
international markets. Improvements in a number of agricultural performance indicators reflect
positively on the farmers' ability to respond and adapt to the changing environment. Such
responsiveness, combined with fertile land and favorable climate, allows a degree of optimism
that the sector can generate significant economic activity and improve rural livelihoods as a
result. This argues strongly for some shift in the regional distribution of public investment
toward rural feeder roads, small irrigation, rural electrification, and market information systems
-just to name a few areas.
38.
The impact of the crisis has demonstrated valuable lessons regarding critical gaps in
macro-management. The first is to set clearer rules regarding the flow of funds from
SONANGOL to the Treasury. The second priority is to have in place the mechanisms to exercise
control over budgetary commitments. A lack of such controls led to a substantial increase in the
The available data on private investment in Angola are limited. Expanding the collection and publication of data
on investment disaggregated by economic sector and by region, would allow for a more comprehensive assessment
of the dynamics of economic growth.

level of arrears. Third, the Govermment needs to decide on principles of anti-cyclical public
spending that would allow it to adjust to fluctuations in oil revenues.
G. GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY
39.
Sustained progress in governance is a pre-condition for the success of Government's
poverty reduction efforts. Available data suggests the need for improvement in a broad range
of governance areas. Transparency International ranks Angola 168h out of 182 countries in
201 Ion its Corruption Perception Index and the Mo Ibrahim index 2011 rates Angola 42nd out
of 53 countries in Africa. Despite overall weakness, the Worldwide Governance Indicators show
improvements in four out of six dimensions of governance" over the past 15 years.

40.
Government has made some advances in strengthening accountability and
transparency. In 2010, the Administrative Probity Law which sets the basis and rules for the
management of public resources was approved. There have been improvements in the Reporting
and Auditing of Government expenditure. The General Accounts of the State have been
published for the first time. Starting in 2010, a quarterly budget execution report is produced,
although not made public. Efforts are underway to bring greater transparency to the management
of oil revenues. "
41.
The Budget" is grounded on the National Development Plan, 2013-2017 detailing the
priorities and actions to be financed during the year. Policies and priorities are explicit, but
are not well connected to the Budget. The budget classification system is comprehensive, but
does not follow international standards. Budget implementation has improved over the last few
years with deviations of actual expenditures from the amounts budgeted declining. Most of the
deviations are underperformance on capital spending attributed to delays owing to capacity
constraints. To strengthen the capacity of the Government to manage the Budget, the Integrated
16

However, the indicators on Government Effectiveness and on Control of Corruption have been erratic and on a
downward trend in recent years.
17

Angola is not yet a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). While the Government
has initiated some actions oriented to achieve EITI accreditation, there are several steps needed to update national
practices to international standards in the diamonds, mineral, and oil and gas sectors.
18The 2013 Budget, equivalent to US$67 billion, marked a 47 percent increase over 2012 as previously off-budget
expenditures were brought on-budget.

12

Financial Management System (SIGFE) has been expanded and the budget execution authority
of local governments has been increased. There has also been satisfactory progress on reducing
the time allowed for submission of General Accounts of the State (CGE) to Tribunal of Accounts
which is responsible for external audit.
42.
There have been recent improvements in the transparency and accountability of
public financial management, but challenges remain. The government has improved
collection and reporting processes for oil revenues and transfers, which is expected to enhance
transparency and accountability in oil-sector management. Notably, the 2013 National Budget
includes, for the first time, quasi-fiscal operations undertaken by the state-owned company
Sonangol, which will help to reduce the budgetary uncertainty associated with oil-revenue
flows.19 Angola's recently established sovereign wealth fund 20 could do much to stabilize
expenditures against oil-price volatility and/or accumulate long-term savings in anticipation of
the eventual decline of the oil sector, though it would be important that its mandate and
governing framework is more clearly specified.
43.
Unclear rules and a weak judicial system threaten the rule of law. The justice system
still suffers from weak territorial coverage, a limited number of qualified personnel and poor
infrastructure. The impact of these deficiencies can be felt throughout the economy and society,
particularly in promoting private sector development, as lack of access to justice is said to be one
of the major factors affecting the willingness of foreign and domestic investors to contribute to
diversification and employment generation. Improvements in the settlement disputes,
enforcement of contracts, and resolution of insolvency cases, where no significant reforms have
been made, are urgently needed to facilitate business development.
44.
Weak public procurement system performance. The government published its
procurement law 20/10 and its presidential Decree 298/10, creating the Gabinete de Contrataqdo
Publica, both in 2010. But in 2013, few procurement practitioners master and practice the law,
there are no bidding documents or manuals, and the Gabinete has been created but is not yet fully
operational. There is still considerable progress required in terms of capacity building of
procurement professionals, relationship with market, transparency, integrity and general
performance of the system.
45.
There is increasing demand for a more accountable, transparent and efficient public
sector in Angola. The challenge will be for the Government to attain a new status of trust,
competence, and respectability. The Government recognizes the difficulty of strengthening the
public sector capacity which inevitably did not receive adequate attention during the war period,
but is investing heavily in civil service training facilities and in information technology. More
pronounced advances in other governance areas beyond the narrow focus on public financial
management could also contribute strongly to the Government's long-term development strategy
and poverty reduction.

19

Ernst & Young completed a full audit of SONANGOL's accounts for 2008, including its quasi-fiscal operations.

Government established a Sovereign Wealth Fund (FSDEA) in 2012 and allocated US$5 billion initially. The
FSDEA will receive transfers of 50 thousand barrels per day from oil revenues.

H. GOVERNMENT'S DEVELOPMENT VISION AND PRIORITIES
46.
The Government has consistently set out its vision for equitable and inclusive
development for all Angolans. These are essentially captured in three overarching strategic
frameworks: (a) Vision 2025; (b) National Development Plan (2013-2017): and (c) Poverty
Reduction Plan (Estrategiade Combate a Pobreza)(ECP)(2010-2015).
47.
The Vision 2025 documents Angola's long-term aspirations for peace and national
reconciliation, sustainable development, establishment of an integrated national economy,
and reduction in inequality. The Vision 2025, completed by the Government in 2008, builds on
Angola's considerable resources and potential and is designed to offer opportunities to all, with a
view to reducing poverty and creating employment opportunities for a majority segment of the
population that has not shared the benefits of recent growth.
48.
The National Development Plan 2013-2017 operationalizes the Vision 2025 and aims at
improving the life quality of all Angolans, reducing hunger and extreme poverty, expanding
youth employment, and diversifying the economy. The Plan underlines the role of the private
sector as a driver of economic growth and the need to better use Angola's abundant human and
natural resources. Various policies are outlined to facilitate access to credit, assist emerging
economic activities, support the informal economy, and encourage companies to integrate
themselves into the business clusters. A progress report on the execution of the National Plan 2 1 is
prepared annually, reporting on achievements made and challenges faced in implementation.
There is scope for establishing a results-based M&E system accompanying the Government's
development strategy, but substantial investments are needed for regular collection of statistics.
49.

The Strategy to Combat Poverty, 2010-2015 (ECP) also embodies the priorities

50.
In addition to the Government-wide strategic documents mentioned above, there
are sector-specific initiatives such as Education For All, Water For All, and Energy For All,
which aim for major expansion in access to public goods and services by 2017. In the area of
social protection, a comprehensive social assistance strategy is under preparation to shift social
protection from focusing mostly on supporting ex-combatants and those affected by the conflict
to ensure that the poor can also take advantage of opportunities offered by economic growth.
Programs such as the National Strategy on Food and NutritionalSecurity and Angola Invest aim
to revitalize the national economy through investments to raise productive competitiveness and
diversify national industries. Many of these initiatives are expected to be weaved together into an
Integrated National Strategy on Economic Diversification and implemented in a closely
coordinated manner.
51.
Featuring prominently in the ongoing discussions on diversification are the planned
investments in commercial agriculture and large infrastructures for energy and transport.
The Government intends to provide a series of supportive public goods central to Angola's
diversification strategy, including agricultural research and extension services, water for
production, electricity for processing, well-maintained feeder roads, business regulatory
simplification, strong education and skills training opportunities, well-equipped and staffed
health services, etc. A few of these investments are mentioned below to give a flavor of the
challenges and opportunities. (See Annex 6, PotentialAreas for Future Bank Group Engagement
developed as a background note for the CPS):
a) Agriculture and Forestry: Less than 3 percent of Angola's abundant fertile land is
cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited.
Diverse climatic conditions favor a wide variety of crops, and there is considerable
irrigation potential. With the right policies to foster on-farm productivity growth and offfarm skills acquisition, Angola's relatively young population can serve as a source of
qualified labor supply as economic diversification intensifies.
b) Ports and Railways: Angola is strategically located, with large markets to the North and
to the South, and is well-positioned to become a regional logistics hub. With the
Benguela Railways going all the way to Luau which borders the Democratic Republic of
Congo, the on-going process of regional integration creates opportunities for the
emergence of new businesses and economic diversification. Railways and ports systems
are undergoing rehabilitation and expansion. Three main railways will soon connect the
ports of Namibe, Luanda, Benguela and Amboim to the interior of the country and to
neighboring countries enabling the emergence of enterprises along the tracks.
c) Energy: Shortage of electricity poses a serious constraint to development as demand
outstrips available electricity. Installed capacity in Angola equals 1913 MW, of which
68% is hydro. The existing three networks are not interconnected and only 30 percent of
the population has access to electricity of varying quality. In addition, a misaligned tariff
structure and poor collection practices-only 40 percent of the services are billed and
only 70 percent of the bills are collected-have led to high government subsidies of
around US$1 billion annually. Nevertheless, the potential to generate power through
15

hydro is immense (up to 16 GW and the third largest in Africa). The Government
recently adopted a US$23 billion investment plan to increase power generation and
transmission capacity more than threefold by 2017. It has also started the process of
implementing institutional reforms with a view to strengthen electricity utilities to make
them financially viable.
52.
Access to financial services is a major constraint to economic activity and
diversification, despite the rapid growth of the financial sector. The assets of the financial sector
stand at 46.8 percent of GDP. Banking dominates the financial sector, with 99 percent of the
assets. Lending is concentrated to wholesale and retail trade as well as construction, with limited
lending to the small and medium enterprises. Indeed, Angola remains largely unbanked with
only 11 percent of the population having access to banking services. In order to increase access
to finance, Government recently launched a guarantee program offering commercial banks up to
70 percent coverage for loans they provide to small and medium-sized enterprises. Credit in rural
areas that could support the emergence of agricultural value chains is virtually non-existent.
53.
Finally, and pervasively, Angola is faced with a significant capacity gap in
implementing its ambitious development vision to diversify the economy and reduce
poverty. The situation is particularly dire in Angola as the long-drawn out war prevented the
needed investment in improving governance and institutional capacity. The availability of oil,
arguably, had the perverse effect of easing the financing constraint and reducing the motivation
to rapidly introduce institutions that would increase the efficiency in the use of public resources.
There is an urgent need to enhance the transparency, efficiency and credibility of public financial
management, strengthen the national statistical system, improve provincial and sectoral plans,
and to implement the legal framework for public procurement.

III. PROPOSED WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
54.
The new Country Partnership Strategy for FY14-16 is prepared at a critical
juncture in the cooperation between World Bank Group (WBG) and Angola, especially as
the country nears its expected graduation from IDA eligibility. As earlier noted, Angola's
development challenges are multi-dimensional and further complicated by the existing regional
disparity as well as still weak institutional and implementation capacity. The country is faced
with the daunting task of distributing the social and economic benefits of its rich natural
resources more evenly, and building a solid foundation for a more inclusive growth based on
economic diversification. At the same time, it needs to continue to expand basic service delivery
and improve service quality in order to achieve MDG targets, and to put into place robust social
protection systems and policies to mitigate exogenous shocks that particularly impact the quality
of life of the poor.
55.
The Government has unequivocally expressed its strong desire to deepen
cooperation with the World Bank Group and worked closely with IDA, IFC, and MIGA staff
to design this Strategy. The joint IDA/IFC/MIGA/WBI Technical Mission in 2012 included 2
weeks of consultations with 12 line Ministries, public institutions, and the Central Bank to
prioritize a long list of potential areas for Bank Group support. Following the national elections
and the changing of key Ministerial portfolios in the new Government, Bank Group Missions in
January and March 2013 were able to narrow down the CPS priority activities after intensive
16

discussions with senior GoA officials of the new Government - a key change as a result has
been the additional request by the Authorities for energy sector support as a key priority.
Renewed interest by the Authorities was also evident in Bank support in Reimbursable Advisory
Services and in the IDA to IBRD transition process.
56.
The nature of the proposed WBG's support to Angola centers around facilitating
knowledge transfer, providing strategic development advice, and building institutions and
capacity, for reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity. The shift away from focus
on provision of concessional development financing toward a more strategic and largely
knowledge-centric engagement is somewhat overdue not only for the WBG but also the
community of development partners as a whole, given that their development financing now
constitutes less than 0.5 percent of total government expenditure.22 In spite of the diminishing
significance of WBG's development financing for Angola relative to its own resources, the
Government strongly values the Bank Group's strategic advice and technical assistance in
implementing its long-term development vision.
A. LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PAST WBG INVOLVEMENT
57.
The proposed CPS for FY14-16 incorporates lessons learned from the past and is
strongly aligned with the country's vision for the future as well as a series of consultations
undertaken with stakeholders (See Annex 7). It is also aligned closely with the priorities laid
out in the Africa Regional Strategy. Gender, climate change adaptation, good governance, and
social protection are important cross-cutting issues that are mainstreamed in the CPS. The CPS
will maximize synergies within the WBG institutions, as well as benefit from comparative
technical strengths of external partners, so that development assistance provided to Angola is
firmly grounded in solid technical analyses and draws on a vast pool of collective development
experiences globally. Such an integrated approach would require: (a) partnerships with various
stakeholders; (b) stepped up demand-driven knowledge generation and advisory work; and (c)
stronger inter-ministerial coordination given multi-dimensional nature of Angola's development
challenges. These were all essential elements of the lessons drawn from 10 years of largely IDA
support to Angola's post-conflict program implementation. Angola's Graduation to IBRD-only
status from FY15 opens a new set of potential issues.
58.
A review of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for 2007-2009 found that the program
had succeeded the most in delivering results in the core social sectors including health,
education and demobilization and reintegration. An Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)
Country Program Assessment Evaluation was also completed in 2006. ICRs are available for
several operations completed over the last 5 years. These reviews and studies gave rise to several
lessons and recommendations (See Annex 8) as summarized below:
* Focus the program on helping the Authorities articulate and implement their vision in
the areas that they request support;
* The core of any WBG program in Angola should be knowledge intensive;
* Better appreciation of the political economy context and governance issues should be

reflected in the design of the projects and AAA;
The design of projects needs to be reconsidered to simplify implementation;
The WBG should significantly strengthen its presence and impact on the ground;
The outcomes and results indicators in the next country strategy should be specific,
measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound;
The partnership within the WBG (IDA, IFC and MIGA) and external partners should
be tightened; and
WBG's role in donor coordination and aid effectiveness and in harnessing the civil
society should be strongly reinforced.

B. THE PROPOSED CPS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES
59.
The CPS responds to a decade of high GDP growth with still high levels of poverty,
inequality, and structural problems of natural-resource dominated Angolan economy, while
addressing the twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and enhancing shared prosperity. Thus
the proposed CPS aims to support the Government of Angola in building on its emerging
strong record of own-management of its development agenda. The Government is already
positioning itself as a fast-growing middle-income economy. Its long-term strategic objectives23
include: (1) ensuring democracy, social cohesion, and macroeconomic stability; (2) promoting
competitiveness and sustainable economic development; (3) promoting human development and
expansion of employment; (4) promoting scientific and technological advancement; (5) building
sustainable supporting infrastructure; (6) supporting emergence of the private sector and
entrepreneurship; and (7) fostering national cohesion and regionally-balanced development. The
CPS will support the Government in making strong progress toward a selected subset of these
objectives, with specific focus on helping to strengthen Angola's national capacity to sustain a
more broad-based economic and social development and shared prosperity. In this regard, the
CPS provides Angola with timely ESWs focusing on rural development, gender constraints,
skills development - which will seek to influence Government policies to reduce poverty,
provide social safety net, and broaden growth through continued support to the non-petroleum
sectors.
60.
Angola is expected to graduate from IDA-eligibility at the end of FY14 as its per
capita income has continued to rise above the IDA threshold for several years. The country
is eligible for access to IBRD funding, but the Authorities have as yet not signaled an interest in
accessing IBRD funding. The CPS is therefore structuredessentially along the lines of a Middle
Income Country (MIC) strategy.
61.

As a consequence, the CPS is guided by two broad principles:
* The CPS places at its core a much stronger emphasis on knowledge, with a relatively
lower priority on direct financial support. Since 2000, Angola has spent upwards of
US$ 150 billion 2 4 for the reconstruction of physical infrastructure and the expansion of

its social services delivery system. It plans to channel a similar scale of public
resources not only to meet the demand of the increasing population,25 but also to
significantly improve the quality of services delivered to them. The importance of
fostering greater local knowledge and capacity generation to support Angola's ownfunded public investments must not be understated. A greater use will be made of
technical assessments and reviews, reimbursable advisory services, seminars and
workshops, and other South-South exchanges, where knowledge and experience could
be broadly shared and disseminated.
The CPS is designed to maximize synergies from partnerships, both internally by
coordinating more closely than in the past the activities of IDA/IBRD, IFC, MIGA,
and WBI as well as externally with traditional and emerging development partners. It
will seek to strengthen cooperation with the NGOs operating in Angola as well as the
corporate social responsibility (CSR) and private development programs (e.g. the
Gates Foundation).2 6
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

62.
The CPS takes as its overarching Strategy the promotion of more inclusive
development, with two core objectives constituting Pillars, and one Foundation Plank of crosscutting nature. The First Pillar focuses on supporting integrated national economic
diversification by revitalizing rural economies toward greater competitiveness and employment.
The focus will be on the strengthening of the non-oil economy, with emphasis on recuperating
traditional lines of business that suffered greatly during the war, as well as the technical
assistance for the energy sector. The focus of the Second Pillar will be on enhancing the quality
of service delivery to improve the quality of life of the population and equip them to take a
greater role in the development of the country and instituting a strong social protection program.
Lastly, the Foundation Plank of the CPS will revolve around building human and institutional
capacity approaching the levels common in the middle-income countries, complementing the
two strategic Pillars.
63.
These objectives would be achieved during the CPS period through stronger attention to
quality and implementation performance enhancements in 4 existing projects and a new
education project, as well as through the expected build-up of a series of reimbursable advisory
services (RAS).

25

Population of estimated 19 million in 2010 is projected to nearly double to 37 million by 2040.

Some complementary funding has already been secured from the European Union (Local Development Project),
Total E&P Angola (Municipal Health Service Strengthening Project), and IFAD (Market-oriented Smallholder
Agriculture Project).

64.
The diversification and service delivery agenda are fully consistent with the World
Bank Group's emphasis on reducing extreme poverty and sharing prosperity. The CPS
contrasts a decade of high GDP growth with still high levels of poverty, inequality, and the
structural problems of natural-resource dominated economy. The CPS proposes to provide the
Authorities with timely ESWs touching on rural development, gender constraints, skills
development - which will seek to influence Government policies to reduce poverty, provide
social safety net, and broaden growth through continued support to the non-petroleum sectors.
PILLAR 1: SUPPORTING INTEGRATED NATIONAL ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION

65.
The Government is placing a strong emphasis on enhancing geographically
balanced growth and on national economic diversification. Promoting regionally balanced
growth and development is not only desirable, but also allows Angola to develop its rich nonpetroleum resources and help accelerate economic diversification. Conditions need to be created
for existing economic agents to become more productive and for new businesses to flourish in
the broader Angolan economy, in addition to the thriving petroleum and gas sector, so that good
jobs could be created in a sustained manner. More growth opportunities in the Provinces would
help to stem the urbanization tide, particularly of those rural farm households which already
possess traditional knowledge that could be upgraded to double or triple crop yields. The tripling
of cassava yield since 1997 attests to the potential of Angolan farmers to achieve high
productivity in other cash crops. Higher yields allow farm households to build up food security
buffer which is essential for them to diversify their production.
66.
Productivity increase is also needed for post-farm gate processing industries and
services to flourish by achieving economies of scale. These industries and services serve to
create jobs along the value chain. With adequate facilitation programs, the Government feels that
the rural economy could build streams of value chains that connect more efficiently to the
market. Similar approaches for diversification applies not only to agriculture, but also fisheries,
forestry, and non-petroleum mining and quarrying which are in fact economic clusters where
Angola once was competitive and still has strong latent potential.

Results Area 1: Rural and Spatial Development
67.
Successful agriculture and rural development can be a powerful instrument for
reducing extreme poverty, increasing food security, and stimulating growth in
employment. In particular, the rural areas are home to the majority of the people identified as
being poor in the 2008 IBEP, so making the rural economy more dynamic will have a farreaching effect on achieving shared prosperity. The Government appreciates the importance of
agriculture and rural development to the country's overall social and economic development and
has supported it as a national priority. The Ministry of Agriculture has identified five major
challenges: (1) increasing overall agricultural production and productivity 27; (2) linking farmers
(particularly smallholders) to markets to raise farmers' income; (3) building rural infrastructure
(e.g., irrigation, transportation, electrification, land quality improvement, etc.); (4) creating nonfarm job opportunities2 8 ; and (5) strengthening the capacity of rural community-based
organizations. The CPS will target also women, to help them to have more access to land and
address gender constraints in the country. The typical rural community faces all of the above
challenges at the same time, so the benefits that can be derived by addressing one challenge at a
time are often significantly undermined owing to the existence of other constraints.
68.
The current Bank portfolio has been restructured to achieve greater
complementarities among sectoral interventions while maintaining a tight geographical focus to
avoid dissipation of effort. The Market Oriented Smallholder Agriculture Project (MOSAP) was
restructured to cover capacity building of smallholder farmers, support small community-based
investment in agribusiness and to building agricultural extensions infrastructure.
For example, in 2010 maize yields averaged 2.07 MT per hectare throughout Africa as a whole, while in Angola
they reached only 0.68 MT per hectare.
27

28

Agriculture contributes only 11% of total GDP, while employing 51% of the labor force. This means that the
marginal productivity of the agricultural labor force is extremely low, implying the need to encourage workers to
move into other sectors to find employment. By transitioning into off-farm rural enterprises, many agricultural
workers will be able to increase their incomes.

21

69.
An Economic and Sector Work (ESW) will be undertaken so that the binding
constraints impeding agricultural growth are well understood. The findings of the ESW can
contribute to the design of a national agriculture and rural development strategy which is central
to the achievement of poverty reduction and shared prosperity as extreme poverty and lack of
services is more pronounced among rural households.2 9 The joint study will include spatial
analysis to identify opportunities and constraints in linking rural farmers to markets.
Results Area 2: Energy Sector Support
70.
Government is implementing an ambitious Five-Year Action Plan to expand the
existing power network and water supply infrastructure. Angola intends to embark on a
US$23 billion investment program to expand the current power generation and transmission
capacity from 1913MW to 7256MW by 2017, extending the access to electricity further to 82
municipalities." The Action Plan contemplates concurrent regulatory reform to unbundle and
rationalize power utilities, to accelerate rural electrification, and to enhance opportunities for
private sector participation in the energy sector. The wider availability of electricity in rural areas
is expected to contribute to more value addition opportunities, contributing over time to nonfarm wage employment and diversification of the rural economy - leading to a reduction in
extreme poverty and allowing shared prosperity. Investment categories range from biomass,
mini-hydros, wind, solar systems to two large-scale hydroelectric projects (1700-2000MW), as
well as off-take of power by proposed aluminum smelter and steel mill projects.
71.
Significant technical and management capacity gaps exist, both at the national level
and in provinces where the expansion projects would be undertaken. The Bank Group will
explore providing an integrated support, including (1) reimbursable advisory services (regulatory
reform, rural electrification, tariff rationalization, operations and maintenance, and training
program at facilities level); (2) IFC advisory services on energy PPPs; and (3) MIGA credit
enhancement and political risk insurance on projects (e.g. Cambambe hydropower project).
Results framework will need calibration depending on the Government's uptake of the above
services.
72.
The Bank Group will explore options for supporting the oil and gas sector
throughout the CPS period, especially with regard to supporting Angola to subscribe to EITI
program. Because of the presence of world-class oil and gas companies already in Angola, and
the growing involvement of SONANGOL in the global market, the Bank Group has been only
involved from time to time in the elaboration of anti-flaring initiative on the margin.

European Union has agreed in principle to work with the Bank on the Integrated Rural Development Strategy and
possibly peering its agriculture project under the upcoming EDF framework to the Bank's TA project on rural
development.

Results Area 3: Private and Financial Sector Development
73.
A key objective of the Government's vision is to accelerate the development of local
industries as part of the diversification and shared prosperity goals. There are important
business environment constraints currently inhibiting a more vibrant and geographically
balanced business development, as noted by various measures on investment climate. Private
sector companies need a stable and conducive business enabling environment, good connectivity
to markets, and sustained advice on best practices in business (e.g. entrepreneurship, corporate
governance, standards, and capacity development such as technical and business training).
Sustained growth of the private sector, especially maximizing the use of the currently underutilized human labor, will be important channel through which to reduce inequality and promote
sharedprosperity.
74.
The latest Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP, 2012) notes significant
constraints in access to finance, particularly the access to credit for small- and medium-sized
enterprises. Financial sector stability and promotion of savings and investment culture will be
essential for strong private sector development. To support the Central Bank in carrying out the
FSAP recommendations, a fee-based service will be prepared in FY14 to support: (i)
strengthening of BNA's supervision capacity; (ii) implementation of Financial Education
Campaign; and (iii) Foreign Exchange management and monitoring. Draft Agreement has been
shared with BNA on Reimbursable Advisory Services for the implementation of the Action Plan
for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML-CFT). Lastly, BNA
has expressed a keen interest in signing up for the Bank's Reserves Advisory and Management
Program (RAMP).
75.
A review of the accountancy profession will be conducted to identify reforms that
could contribute to (1) increasing the number of professional accountants serving private and
public sectors and (2) enhancing quality of financial reporting for enhanced cash-flow based
financing and improved business competitiveness.
76.
A Seminar on Financing Options for senior Government officials is planned early in
FY14 to raise awareness about various forms of financing instruments available in the global
market. Given imminent IDA graduation, the Seminar will also address the access to and benefits
of IBRD financing, use of IFC and MIGA products to maximize their leverage on private capital.
77.
A time-bound advisory service geared toward removing bureaucratic and
regulatory overhang will be developed. To make Angola's business environment more
conducive to private sector growth, a multi-year reform program will be needed to remove
regulatory and procedural bottlenecks inhibiting or delaying business operations.
78.
The Government is putting in place a Public Private Partnerships (PPP) legal and
regulatory framework to attract and oversee private sector investments in crucial
infrastructure, energy, and transport sectors. On a cost recovery basis, the Bank Group is
ready to provide technical assistance to strengthen institutional and technical capacity, to design
and implement a comprehensive training course on PPPs, and to prepare PPP projects manuals
for selected economic sectors based on international best practices.

To help build entrepreneurial capacity, the Business Edge Program is well
positioned to provide advice, problem solving, and training to companies, industries, and
governments. Private sector partners have expressed interest in funding the pilot phase of this
program (training of the trainers and tailoring the Portuguese translation of the training manuals
to the Angolan context). The National Bank of Angola has expressed interest in co-hosting with
IFC a private sector workshop which is intended to (a) raise awareness about IFC's possible
activities; and (b) serve as an important step in updating WBG knowledge 3' of the Angolan
private sector's needs and priorities. The common objective of these interventions is to help
unleash the private sector's innate ability to develop new lines of businesses and to create the
large number of jobs that Angola needs.

2: ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF SERVICE DELIVERY
AND DEEPENING SOCIAL PROTECTION

Results Area 1: Enhancing the Quality of Service Delivery
80.
Government stresses the importance of enhancing the quality of services along with
the ongoing expansion of service delivery. Experience from other countries, however, suggests
that expansion in the access to services was accompanied by deterioration in quality of services
Structured as a forum to hear directly from cross section of the private sector perspectives on the opportunities,
challenges, constraints and experiences as well as how the WBG can assist in unlocking the full potential of the

and outcomes (stagnating completion rates, worsening literacy and numeracy skills, inability to
contain HIV/AIDS and other epidemics), so more actions are needed to ensure adequate quality
of services, with a special focus on women. In fact, in the rural economy which is based largely
on subsistence agriculture or artisanal fishing, basic education, health, infrastructure, and social
protection services allow the households the necessary means to build human capital and
increase long-term productivity. Improvements in livelihood of the households in the bottom
income quintiles can only be sustained if members of the households individually can achieve
productivity growth.

81.
Supporting the Government's efforts in decentralization: Developing national and
local capacity to deliver quality services and systems expansion is an important element in the
on-going projects. Especially Local Development Project (LDP, FY10), now underway, covers
capacity building of local government at a municipality level across the sectors. Other IDAfunded projects also aim to strengthen capacity in planning and business management of social
infrastructure construction, i.e. schools, health facilities, and water delivery. Through ongoing
projects, the CPS intends to enhance system-wide efficiency and value for money for key
services.
82.
Focusing particularly on poor segment of the population, the Bank will continue to
support the enhancement of sustainable water supply systems. The Water Sector Institutional
Development Project (WSIDP, FY09) is supporting institutional reforms for water supply and
sanitation utilities, complemented by an aggressive capital investment program to rehabilitate
treatment facilities, pumping stations, transmission mains and distribution networks in peri-urban
areas. The project focuses on creating regulatory and institutional frameworks for delivery of
25

water and sanitation services.3 2 In 2011, an additional credit in an amount of US$120 million was
approved for WSIDP to support improved water supply access by scaling-up the investments in
the nine cities, eventually allowing connections to about 486,000 poor people.
83.
There is scope for complementing the WSIDP with additional strategic assistance,
including in sanitation:
a) Capacity-building (FY14-16) through South-South Cooperation in the Water and Energy
Sector by establishing a systematic exchange with Brazil and Portugal (language
limitation). Direct cost of Government could be financed by existing Project with minor
restructuring; and
b) A Water & Sanitation Program (WSP) Sanitation study to determine existing gaps in
access to sanitation and estimate the economic value of improving sanitation for better
health outcomes (FY14-15).
84.
The CPS puts a strong emphasis on improving the quality of education, especially
for girls. The Bank's support for improving the quality of education in Angola is grounded in
recent analytical work and consistent with the objective of reducing poverty and enhancing
shared prosperity. Given the progress being made in increasing access to education under the
Government program, the Bank's support focuses on quality through:
a) The Learning for All Project (FY14, to be presented to Board together with the CPS)
targets enhancing the quality of teaching and the school accountability. The focus on
teaching quality is to be achieved by improving teacher knowledge and skills (i.e.
mathematics, Portuguese, pedagogy). School accountability focuses on being tightly
linked to the ongoing process to decentralize responsibility for primary education to
municipalities. In addition, the project aims to help the Government put into place a
system of assessment to track primary learning outcomes, by developing a supporting
database. Attention will also be given to improving the capacity of the Ministry of
Education and the local administration of the targeted school districts (ZIP).
b) The READ Project (Russian trust-funded TA project launched in FY12) will introduce a
solid national assessment system in Education which will contribute to finding a gap in
learning and reform the pedagogy in classrooms.
85.
Improving the quality of health services. The CPS supports institutional reforms and
investments to create conditions favorable to improving health indicators, especially regarding
child and maternal mortality. Bank support through the ongoing Municipal Health Service
StrengtheningProject (FY10) targets increased provision of pre-natal health care, immunization,
institutional delivery of births, and the provision of a basic package of health, nutrition and
population services. The project will also support analytical work to inform policy and decision
making in areas such as human resources, health care financing and coverage, as well as a
nutrition gap analysis. It is anticipated that these efforts will strengthen the stewardship role of

These include the creation of National Institute for Water Resources (done in October 2010), autonomous Provincial

of children and maternal mortality. A strategic partnership with TOTAL E&P Angola has been
signed, availing to the Bank up to $4.5 million supplementary funding over the life of the
project.
Results Area 2: Deepening Social Protection
86.
Social Protection has evolved following country needs. After focusing on supporting
the displaced population as well as households and individuals affected by the civil war (which
displaced about 4.5 million and landmines affected 17 percent of the population), the
Government has now shifted social protection priorities to address food insecurity, gender,
poverty and vulnerability. After issuing the general framework for social protection in 2004, the
Government is developing a social assistance strategy to create a system to support the extremely
poor and vulnerable groups. A well-targeted social safety net provides the necessary buffer
against various shocks which tend to push people back into poverty. The subsistence farmers, in
particular, are constrained from crop diversification because they have no scope to try something
new - e.g. adoption of techniques which promise higher productivity - without adequate
protection against food insecurity.
87.
The Bank will partner with UNICEF and the European Union to enhance Government
capacity to design, implement and monitor an effective social protection strategy that assists
the extremely poor and vulnerable to mitigate the immediate impact of poverty and to
reduce medium term poverty. (FY14-16) Activities to this end could include:
a) A review of social assistance programs and social protection expenditures to identify the
risks and vulnerabilities of the different groups, assess the existing supply of social safety
net programs and identify the gaps between risks and existing interventions. The
assessment will help government to identify priorities and prepare a social assistance
policy and operational plan (FY14-FY15);
b) Technical assistance to develop and implement tools to make operational the social
assistance strategy, such as a targeting mechanism to select the poorest, a registry of
beneficiaries, and monitoring and evaluation tools to improve the effectiveness of current
and future social assistance programs (FY15-FY16);
c) Analytical work to identify specific conditions of certain groups in order to develop and
implement tailored interventions as part of the social protection system. Possible groups
are children (and nutrition and early childhood development) and low income youth-atsocial-risk. One intervention will be prepared in FY15 and another in FY16.
88.
The Bank's engagement in social protection in Angola has been historically through
the support to the Social Action Fund (FAS). The Local Development Project (FY10), a credit
of US$81.7 million which became effective in August 2011, is the fourth operation supported by
the Bank after FAS I, II and III. The Bank and the EU have reached an understanding that an
additional 630 million would be provided as a co-financing grant to FAS, to scale up existing
efforts to expand social infrastructure in rural areas and build capacity at local level, as well as
strengthening M&E instruments, including a rigorous impact evaluation, audits, and staffing to
monitor and support the implementation of the program.

FOUNDATION PLANK: BUILDING HUMAN / INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY
AND RESILIENCE TO SHOCKS

Results Area 1: Economic Management and Planning
89.
Stable and sound macroeconomic environment is an important objective of Angolan
Authorities, particularly since the 2008 crisis and in the current volatile global environment. It
provides the business community with stability and predictability in investing money for
expansion or diversification - i.e. leading to growth in employment. There is a wide range of
capacity-building and technical assistance needs in the area of economic management and public
sector operations. A series of reimbursable advisory servicesis being discussed in the areas of
public investment management, medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), macroeconomic
modeling and economic analysis, and statistics compilation (national accounts, prices, and a
census of firms).
90.
In line with the greater focus on knowledge, the Bank plans to undertake the following
core diagnostics on Angola:
a) Public Expenditure Review (PER): The Budget is the main instrument to achieve the
Government's objective of economic diversification and good governance. The PER will
examine Government expenditures and budget processes to assess the equity, targeting,
efficiency, and effectiveness of budgetary allocations in the context of Angola's
macroeconomic framework and sector priorities.
b) Country Economic Memorandum (CEM): The aim of a new CEM is to help design a
medium-term strategy for economic diversification and employment creation for Angola
by identifying and understanding the potential non-oil growth sectors and their
diversification prospects.
c) Angola Economic Updates (AEUs): The semi-annual series will be launched in 2013 to
assess macroeconomic developments and cross-sector issues affecting economic growth,
diversification, and poverty reduction. The AEUs will review the recent economic trends
28

and growth prospects in Angola and will juxtapose these with the unfolding situation at
the global level.

Build awareness about Angola's exposure to severe
weather events and to long-term effects of global
climate change

Results Area 2: Integrated Skills Development Strategy
91.
Angola's key natural resources are non-renewable. High capital intensity of petroleum
and gas industries and the business pattern that so far has limited downstream industry spillovers
suggests that there needs to be a concerted effort to diversify the productive base and improve
social conditions to the level of average middle-income countries. Conditions need to be created
for existing economic agents to become more productive and for new businesses to flourish in
the broader Angolan economy, in addition to the thriving petroleum and gas sector, so that good
jobs can be created in a sustained manner. Governments can actively promote economy-wide
skills development which transform currently unviable business opportunities into profitable
enterprises capable of absorbing increasingly skilled labor.
92.
There is a need to more closely link human capital development, so that more
qualified Angolans would be able to fill the jobs created by the private sector. This is a
prerequisite for economic diversification and promotion of shared prosperity. In education,
stronger private sector linkage can be built in the technical and vocational education and training
(TVET) to ensure that the schools equip the students with the skills demanded by businesses.
The Government has set an ambitious target of doubling skilled and semi-skilled workforce in 10
years. The CPS proposes a multi-sectoral and integrated study on skills development.
93.
Youth unemployment is likely to get worse due to the demographic trends. High
numbers of unemployed youths pose a risk to cohesion and peace. The Bank could help to
enhance the understanding of youth unemployment in Angola by preparing a Youth Employment
Policy Note (FY15). The Government can design a Youth Employment program including skills
development and labor intensive temporary works for the youth. In several countries which
succeeded in increasing average income and reducing inequality, the investment in the education
and skills training of the youth had a profound impact on raising the overall household income
within a generation. For reduction of extreme poverty and promotion of shared prosperity,
investing in youth should be arguably the most important priority of the State.
29

Results Area 3: Human Capacity and Institutions Building
94.
Human capacity and institutional building will be a cross-cutting objective of Bank
Group support to Angola. The two Strategic Pillars will be complemented by a cross-sectoral
Foundation Plank to build human capacity and institutions. Institutional setup will need to
develop in tandem with broader geographic and economic diversification and increasing need to
place service delivery closer to the growing population.
95.
The objective of building national institutions and capacity has been incorporated in
ongoing projects. For example, MOSAP (FY09) trains smallholder farmers and agricultural
extension workers and Local Development Project (FY10) enhances the local institutional
capacity at municipality level for better service delivery. The institutional capacity building must
be continued in all interventions contemplated under the CPS.
96.
The Bank's development knowledge, together with its global knowledge network,
will provide useful inputs to build Angola's own capacity. The Bank will update its
information base on Angola, provide human capacity and institution-building support, and
function as a clearing-house of knowledge from other MIC countries (South-South exchange).
WBI courses introducing cutting edge approaches to development (e.g. Frontiers of
Development, Urban Planning, Climate Change Adaptation, Inclusive Growth, etc.) will be an
important element in this regard.

97.
A key innovative effort of the Strategy would be to agree with the Authorities on
four to five key national institutions for which the Bank Group would make a firm
assessment, covering say 10 years, of their key human capacity needs. A strategic program
for the realization of these key institutions over that period and beyond would then be
determined for focused implementation. Possible institutions for such an approach might include:
The National Institute of Statistics (INE); The Institute for Local Administration (IFAL); The
National Institute of Water Resources; The National School of Administration (ENAD); and
possibly Ministries of Planning; Economy; Finance; and Energy and Water.
98.

In parallel, WBI is discussing with Ministry of Public Service and Ministry of

30

Territorial Administration possible ways of accelerating capacity building at central and
local levels by supporting the training programs of the National School of Administration
(ENAD) and the Institute for Local Administration Training (IFAL). Neither of these training
programs currently offers courses on development and economics topics, or on specific issues
pertaining to service delivery. More than 45 e-Leaming courses from WBI could be made
available to these agencies, and also the public universities, provided that funding can be secured
to translate the teaching materials.
99.
Angola is exposed to significant climate change risks. Due to the destruction of
meteorological stations during the war, climate variation patterns over the last 3 decades are
virtually unknown. Anecdotal evidence during 2006/7 floods suggests that large number of cropgrowing areas hitherto not exposed to regular flooding had been inundated. Water Sector
InstitutionalDevelopment Project (WSIDP, FY09) is financing 189 new meteorological stations
and a monitoring system, and is financing two river basin studies. Other evidence suggests that
some fish stock in Angolan waters have migrated elsewhere due to overall rise in seawater
temperature. There is an urgent need to reinforce climate resilience into key infrastructure that
Angola is planning to invest in. Volatility in weather change patterns also renders traditional
crops more difficult to grow and prone to crop failures which are detrimental to the households
in extreme poverty. To raise awareness of this risk and to showcase the adaptation measures
already being taken by other countries, the Bank will explore organizing a Climate Change and
Disaster Risk Reduction Seminar during the CPS period.

The CurrentPorrfolio

101. Four projects are under implementation with a combined size US$359.5 million and
average age of 4 years. Effectiveness delays plagued the current portfolio as shown in Figure 6.
These projects will deliver a good share of expected results under the CPS.
102. The portfolio quality has improved significantly in the last 12 months, with all
projects being rated marginally satisfactory for Development Objective. The overall
disbursement rate rose from 1.2 percent at end-2011 to 11.8 percent by end-June 2013 owing to
31

acceleration of project activities. The Market-Oriented Smallholder Agriculture Project was
restructured in February 2013 with a cancellation of US$8.5 million for activities which are not
likely to be carried out by the September 2014 closing date.
103.
There is some scope for fine-tuning the activities under the existing projects to
complement other components of the CPS. Some US$295 million undisbursed funds will
continue to provide important investments in water systems, agricultural extension services,
health facilities, and local institutions. In spite of recent improvements, the Angola portfolio
continues to perform below the regional average. The efforts to improve capacity in financial
management and procurement need to be continued in order to mitigate capacity constraints.
Where possible, the projects will be fine-tuned to track progress on reducing gender disparity by
using "genderized" results indicators.
New Pipeline
104.
The IDA16 (FY12-14) indicative allocation for Angola is about US$170 million, of
which US$75 million has been allocated to Learningfor All Project which is being presented to
the Board together with this CPS. The remainder of the funding will not be utilized given the
lack of time to prepare an operation before the end of IDA-16 cycle and the emerging shift to
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS)33 .
105.
During the transition period as Angola graduates from IDA and considers accessing
IBRD financing, RAS would likely be the preferred instrument by which Angola acquires
knowledge and training assistance from the WBG. As an initial introduction to the process, the
Bank is brokering a study tour to a number of Gulf States clients already utilizing this
instrument. Recently, a US$670,000 RAS with the Central Bank for assistance in strengthening
Angola's Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) capacity
has been developed and awaiting BNA approval. Discussions are ongoing to put in place RAS
for financial and private sector development, energy sector development, and Economic
Management.
A.

DELIVERING THROUGH INTEGRATED PARTNERSHIPS

Internal Partnerships
106. The Bank, IFC, MIGA, and WBI will strengthen its partnership to help Angola in
overcoming its development challenges. The year-long in-country discussions with the
Authorities for the preparation of the CPS were undertaken jointly. Already, there is an emerging
coordination of activities around the energy sector with cross-debriefing and sharing of existing
knowledge across institutional boundaries. The synergy among WBG institutions, each focusing
on the parts fitting its mandate, has proven exceptionally effective in building a credible dialogue
with the Authorities on the CPS.

RAS or Fee-for-Services Agreements are often used by countries which do not need significant financing support
but would benefit from tailor-made knowledge transfer or policy advice from WBG. The service is provided on a
cost-recovery basis and could be provided on a confidential basis as it is the beneficiary country which pays for the
service.
3

32

107.
International Finance Corporation (IFC) will continue to partner with IDA to provide
advisory support to Angola in improving the business environment and removing hurdles that
inhibit private sector growth generally and focusing on specific sectors. IFC can also provide
upon request specific advisory services to improve access to finance, support sustainable
business development of SMEs, and facilitate Private-Public partnerships (PPPs). Conditions
permitting, IFC can also explore business development for investment opportunities in the
financial sector, agribusiness, general manufacturing and services, and infrastructure.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has recently approved a US$512 million
guarantee for commercial loans for Cambambe hydropower project, and is exploring similar
operations to help protect private investments in Angola. MIGA's involvement helped to secure
long-term financing at competitive terms. Given the large volume of planned infrastructure
projects, Angola can derive significant benefits with MIGA engagement. World Bank Institute
(WBI) will be engaged not only to provide direct support to capacity development initiatives
undertaken by Government, but also to incorporate WBI's knowledge and capacity-building
experience into the design of Bank operations undertaken during the CPS period. (See Annex 9
for details on the scope of IFC, MIGA, and WBI programs)
External Partnerships
108.
The WBG has been working in partnership with several other development
partners and the private sector. Co-financing is the one of the forms of collaboration. The
Market Oriented Smallholder Agriculture Project (FY09) has leveraged funds from IFAD (US$
8.2 million) and Japan though PHRD grant (US$ 4 million) along with the US$ 30 million of
IDA resources. Moreover, the Municipal Health Service Strengthening Project (FY10, US$ 70.8
million) collaborates with UNICEF, WHO, and UNFPA on technical and implementation issues.
The same project also involved the private sector, with Total E&P Angola providing an
additional funding of US$ 4.5 million to support the several sub-components of the project.3 4
Building on the existing collaboration on the ground, the strengthened partnership will be
expected with both bilateral and multilateral donors for the Bank to supplement the Bank
operation effectively. (See Annex 14 for details on Donor Activities)
109.
Opportunities for closer collaboration with a number of development partners are
being explored in an integrated and structured way around following clusters:

34

*

European Union (EU) will work with the Bank on agriculture, technical-vocational
education, and local development in its forthcoming Strategy due in 2014. EU has agreed
to partially finance the Agriculture Development Study (CPS Pillar 1), and to work
jointly with the Bank on future analytical work on labor and technical education. A
strong partnership with the EU in local governance and social protection is in place with
EU-funded Additional Financing being prepared for the ongoing IDA Local
Development Project.

*

African Development Bank (AfDB) was asked by GoA to elaborate for Angola a
National Economic Diversification Strategy recently. At the specific request of the
Government, the Bank will collaborate by undertaking some complementary analytical

33

work as warranted, including lead work on spatial development and planning. The Bank
will also work with AfDB in updating the 2008 Country Gender Profile, making use of
IBEP data which was not available earlier.
*

United Nations (UN) Agencies have worked closely with Bank projects (e.g. social
protection joint work and technical support for 2008 household survey - UNICEF)

*

Japan has provided PHRD Grant funding for Market-Oriented Smallholder Agriculture
Project, and is interested in taking part in joint analytical work on agriculture.

*

Norway has indicated interest in supporting the policy dialogue and capacity building in
the energy and related infrastructure cluster, possibly through a secondment of a technical
expert to the Bank's Country Office.

*

The South-South Knowledge Exchange with Brazil is planned as an explicit CPS
activity in the water and sanitation sector, and similar opportunities will be explored in
agricultural research and rural development (EMBRAPA) and social safety net (Bolsa
Familia) and wider social protection.

*

The Bank and the USAID have collaborated more closely on financial sector
development where the existing USAID direct-funded programs are phasing out. USAID
has also produced a comprehensive study on Angola's Energy sector needs and intends to
work with the Bank Group in the energy sector.

*

China is Angola's key partner on infrastructure projects. Opportunities for technical
collaboration, for instance on spatial infrastructure planning, will be explored.

110. The Bank Group as a whole will continue to leverage its support by working in
partnership with various other stakeholders in Angola. Private partners have mobilized funds
directly for community level activities, with some overlapping areas of interest with the Bank. A
"win-win" partnership can be created between the Bank and the private entities linking their
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs. There is also scope for building partnerships
with Emerging Countries through South-South cooperation.
111.
The implementation of the CPS aims at also deepening partnerships with Civil
Society Organizations (CSOs) for knowledge generation. Through regular consultation, the
Bank will work closely with the non-state actors including the think thanks, research institutions,
the academia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and community based organizations to
generate knowledge.
B. RISKS
DirectRisks to the CPS Implementation
112.
Results and Outcomes. There is a substantial risk that the Bank Group will not attain the
defined results and outcome under the CPS owing to a variety of reasons, including the small
relative scale of its interventions. Further at the level of Government, there is weak on-ground
capacity for public financial management and procurement reforms, lack of access to basic
information (e.g. statistics), and complex national political economy dynamics. Yet, the current
stable economic environment provides a window of opportunity for renewed economic reforms,
especially in the energy, financial and economic management, and wider infrastructure areas.
Even modest success in these areas would go a sizable way in impacting poverty levels and
34

shared prosperity, given the overarching centrality of these sectors to governance and inclusive
economic management. In addition, the Bank could play an important role, through analytical
and other activities, in highlighting the importance of sustaining with ongoing and future
reforms.
113.
Angola does not access IBRD resources. In spite of being creditworthy for IBRD
financing, it is possible that the GoA may choose not to borrow from IBRD. The CPS makes full
use of other Bank Group activities such as those available through IFC and MIGA, in addition to
AAA and RAS, in order to deepen its engagement with Angola. MIGA has already begun to
intensify its operations in Angola's energy sector, and the Bank expects to shortly sign its first
RAS with National Bank of Angola in the financial sector. Finally, a comprehensive review
would be undertaken at mid-term implementation of the CPS, with a view to more decisively
charting out alternative strategic options should the Government not have accessed the IBRD
window by that time.
OverallRisks to the OperatingEnvironment
114.
Economic Vulnerabilities - "Hard-landing" due to a sudden drop in oil price.
Angola's economy and public sector revenues remain very dependent on the oil industry, so there
is a significant risk of a sudden economic slow-down due to oil market developments. Angola's
ability to manage a "soft landing" from current high levels of economic activity will depend
critically on continued structural reforms - particularly greater control of public expenditure and
efficiency of public services, continued financial sector reform, and maintenance of a strong
fiscal position through the cyclical upswing. In the event of a hard-landing, budget allocations to
priority spending on basic services and social safety net could be cut back or grow at a slower
pace. The Bank will have ongoing projects for education, health, and water during the CPS
period which could assist the service delivery sectors to increase efficiency of spending. Also,
compared to the 2008 crisis, the Bank is better positioned to help the Authorities to minimize the
macro impact of an economic downturn by assisting them through programs such as the RAMP
and a RAS on economic management.
115.
Failure to address disparity and equity issues. While a significant degree of political
stability has been observed in Angola in the past decade, the existing disparity and inequality
need to be addressed in order to avoid conflict and violence, which is disproportionately
damaging for the poor. Large numbers of peri-urban youth, who are unemployed or
underemployed in the informal sector are a source of instability and need to benefit from
increased social and economic inclusion. There is always the risk of flare-up protests and social
upheavals given the insufficient capacity in the Government to push ahead with multiple reforms
in a short period of time. The WBG intends to help Government mitigate this risk by
communicating reform details to all stakeholders. A steadfast implementation of the recently
formulated Government strategies and the support envisioned in this CPS, especially in the areas
of boosting service delivery and social protection, are therefore important mitigating elements to
assist in the transition to a more inclusive development model.

Annex 3: Angola - Statistical Issues
Angola has several regular and informative statistical publications produced by different
government agencies; reflecting some progress in the provision of data and transparency in
statistical reporting. Despite improvements in the frequency and availability of basic
economic and social statistics, there are some concerns about data quality and timeliness in
Angola. Efforts are underway, however, to strengthen the statistical base, including through
technical assistance from the World Bank, the IMF, the European Union and UNICEF.
The relevant statistical publications include the quarterly statistical bulletin of the National
Bank of Angola (BNA), the quarterly budget execution reports of the Ministry of Finance, and
the quarterly economic outlook of the National Institute of Statistics (INE). INE also
published an informative inflation report. Data postings on the government website
(www.minfin.gov.ao), including revenues from the oil sector, but are not as timely as
recommended in the General Data Dissemination System. The BNA recently redesigned its
website, to make it more accessible and timely, and INE initiated its website in 2011.
National accounts and price statistics
Official GDP estimates are published annually and generally only by sector, with no
disaggregation by industry and the government sector is not identified. Annual GDP at
constant prices is estimated using 2002 prices. There are no estimates of GDP by expenditure.
The government is currently working towards the establishment of a quarterly GDP series.
Apart from oil production, sectoral data are calculated using indicators with weights based on
incomplete surveys conducted in 2001 or earlier. A lack of statistical offices in the provinces
significantly limits data coverage.
The CPI is based on a basket of goods and services for which prices are collected in Luanda.
The geographical coverage of price collection was extended to five more provinces and an
unofficial quarterly index has been compiled commencing in 2005. The CPI weights were
revised in January 2002 based on a household survey conducted in 2001. CPI data are
produced monthly, normally with a lag of two weeks. In 2012 INE started publishing an index
of wholesale prices.
Poverty and welfare indicators
In 2011 INE published the results of the 2008-09 Survey on the Welfare of the Population
with the technical support of the World Bank and UNICEF. This survey is not comparable
with the Household Survey conducted in 2000-01. Poverty data was produced but more can be
done in order to improve the quality and periodicity of the estimates. The World Bank has
been discussing with the national statistical office (INE) diverse alternatives to work on
institutional and capacity building issues.
Monetary and financial statistics
Data for the financial sector and the balance sheet of the central bank are timely but still based
on old report forms. There are concerns about the quality and timeliness of reports from some
commercial banks. The IMF has been assisting the BNA in compilation of monthly monetary
statistics using the new standardized report forms.
42

Government finance statistics
The timeliness and quality of government finance statistics has improved recently but it is still
an issue to be further developed by the government to strengthen public financial management
and fiscal policy. Budget execution reports reflect liabilities for tax payments as estimated in
the budget (budget basis), rather than revenues collected (cash basis); and expenditures reflect
only expenditures on a cash basis rather than expenditure on a commitment basis.
Data from the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) are still limited
in coverage and reliability, and subject to revisions. Monthly government accounts tend to
rely on estimates based on the budget rather than on actual execution figures. The Ministry of
Finance does not report a significant number of series for government finance data for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook or in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS).
External sector statistics
The balance of payments and international investment position are compiled in line with the
recommendations of the fifth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual. These
statistics are compiled and disseminated annually, with a lag of nine months after the
reference period. The technical units are understaffed and there are problems of noncompliance with data reporting requirements by resident enterprises. A thorough review of the
balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) for 2008 and 2009 was
conducted.
The authorities have made progress regarding the methodological soundness of classification
of balance of payments transactions. Nonetheless, some inconsistencies have been found,
especially regarding the classification of transactions involving arrears and SDRs. The IIP
showed important inconsistencies with the balance of payments and the external debt
statement. Coverage and timeliness of source data remain a major shortcoming. The
development of the BNA's International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS), known as
SIOBE, was halted due both to lack of staff and the uncertainty regarding its replacement by a
similar ITRS being developed by the BNA.
Continued improvement in the quality of government statistics needs: (1) an increase in the
rate of response to the surveys, including the adoption of administrative measures to curb
noncompliance with reporting requirements; (2) implementation of tools and mechanisms for
the organization, analysis and validation of ITRS data; (3) compliance with commitments in
the agreements signed with the National Statistics Institute, and the MoF for access to their
databases; and (4) integration of more data sources. In order to reach these goals, INE has
developed a national strategy on statistics, published in 2011, and has been developing its
implementation strategy in coordination with the BNA and line ministries.
The Bank is well-placed to provide technical and capacity-building assistance for statistics. In
addition to the areas of welfare and poverty indicators discussed above, the World Bank has
discussed with INE alternatives on technical assistance on national accounts, prices, and a
census of firms.

43

Annex 4: Key Constraints to Shared Prosperity in Angola
The existing regional disparity Angola is a condition created by the prolonged war
and will take time and concerted effort to overcome. The 2008/9 IBEP documents the
high migration from provinces to the capital city of Luanda during the initial phase of the
war (1975-1992). At the peak of the influx into Luanda, some 38 percent of the city
inhabitants were said to have moved from other parts of the country. Today, this figure is
still significant at 30.5 percent. The principal reasons for families to have migrated away
from their places of birth are because of war and for family reunification. Moreover, the
poorest quintile of the households reported the war to be the main reason for migration (39
percent), and very small share of them migrated in search of work (3 percent) or schooling
(1 percent).

Access to services is significantly better in Luanda than the rest of the country. In
addition to the access to water, sanitation, and electricity shown in Figure A-2 below, most
other social indicators show better conditions in Luanda: poverty incidence is 8.6 percent
compared to the national rate of 36.6 percent; population with no access to schools is low at
7 percent, compared to the 20 percent national median and 41 percent in Kuando Kubango
province; just 4 percent of Luanda households use charcoal for cooking whereas this figure
ranges from 22 to 49 percent in other provinces; 78 percent of Luanda babies were
delivered with assistance from a health professional while the corresponding figure in Uige
province was 21 percent. Combined with the apparent income disparity as shown in Figure
Al above, the availability of better services in large cities may have contributed to the
rapid urbanization, principally to Luanda.

kilometers beyond the historical
center of Luanda (Cain et al,
2002). Sanitary conditions in
these areas are very poor, and

sporadically trigger the cholera
epidemic (MSF, 2006). Neither

does the Luanda economy provide sufficient opportunities for employment to the families
living in the outskirts, so young people enter the small-scale informal workshops or fend
for themselves in the streets selling imported consumer goods. 35 The importance of
creating a more diversified economy and aligning the education system to produce
qualified labor for such an economy is perhaps more urgent in Luanda which not only has
to address all the negative effects of rapid urbanization, but also has to deal with the
immediately visible income disparity among its residents.
There are also structural reasons for regional disparity in income and access to
services. About 50 percent of Angolans work in largely informal agriculture sector which
suffers from historically low productivity and lack of access to markets. Those who have
migrated to urban centers work in the informal sector (e.g. street side vendors) or in lowpaying service jobs (for example, as unskilled construction workers or security guards).
Furthermore, despite rapid expansion of basic services, the inland provinces still lack water
and sanitation services, health care, access to electricity, and transport linkages with urban
markets. The Government has established programs such as Water for All, Energy for All,
and Education for All programs to overcome these constraints so that all Angolans can
benefit from the shared prosperity of a rapidly growing economy.

35 Significant urbanization is taking place in other large cities such as Huambo, Benguela, Lobito, and

Lubango.

ANNEX

6:

BACKGROUND NOTE ON POTENTIAL AREAS FOR BANK ENGAGEMENT

1.
Angola is strategically located, with large markets to the North and to the South,
and is well-positioned to become a regional logistics hub. With the Benguela Railways going
all the way to Luau which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo, the on-going process of
regional integration creates opportunities for the emergence of new businesses and economic
diversification. Previously dislocated refugees (some 440,000 at peak) can serve as a conduit to
link Angola to its neighbors. Likewise, about 1 percent of the Angolan population is said to have
migrated from overseas.
2.
Angola has been one of the fastest growing oil producers over the last decade, with
production more than doubling from approximately 0.75 million barrels per day in 2000 to more
than 1.7 million barrels per day in 2010. Angola is expected to complete the construction of a
large-scale liquefied natural gas facility in 2013 to capture previously flared associated gas for
export. As a capital intensive industry, however, the petroleum and gas sector employs only
22,510 workers out of an estimated 6.1 million total jobs in the country. There is potential for
more direct and indirect jobs to be created from further development of downstream
petrochemicals industry. Other sectors such as power generation and processing of raw metals
and minerals could also become commercially viable as the petrochemicals industry is gradually
built up.
3.
Less than 3 percent of Angola's abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic
potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited. Diverse climatic conditions favor
a wide variety of crops, and there is considerable irrigation potential. With the right policies to
foster on-farm productivity growth and off-farm skills acquisition, Angola's relatively young
population can serve as a source of qualified labor supply as economic diversification intensifies.
Forest area represents about 45 percent of total land area, with some 53 million hectares of forest
resources and an annual deforestation rate of 0.2 percent. Timber production under a sustainable
forest resource management, coupled with improved transport networks, would allow sustained
production of 330,000 m3 per year.
4.
Angola was a major exporter in the 1960s and has one of richest fisheries resources
in Africa, ranging from shrimp, mackerel, sardinella, hake, and tunas of high value (bluefin,
yellowfin, bigeye). Fisheries production has increased from 239,000 MT in 2000 to around
312,000 MT by 2007 (with a potential annual yield of 360,000 MT). Approximately 21,000
artisanal fishermen with a fleet of roughly 4,500 boats operate off the coast of Angola, and
25,000 more engaged in inland fisheries, while the number of people directly dependent on and
engaged in fishing activities (handling, processing, and marketing) is estimated at 140,000.
Significant opportunities exist for increasing employment, production and profitability in the
sector. Government is promoting aquaculture and inland fishing as an important source of
protein (food security) and employment (poverty reduction) for rural and coastal communities.
5.
Angola's currently stable strong macroeconomic position, including a stock of
national external reserves totaling almost US$34 billion at the end of December, 2012, amply
cushions it from endogenously or exogenously generated shocks and offers it a unique
opportunity for sustainably embarking on an integrated and comprehensive program of national
economic development, fuelled by oil.

47

6.
Yet, despite these current resource endowments, accumulated through rapid and
high economic growth in the past decade, Angola still faces enormous challenges as a
nation, even as it now transitions from low income to middle income status. A key role of
the Government to provide a series of supportive public goods is central to Angola's
diversification strategy, including agricultural research and extension services, water for
production, electricity for processing, well-maintained feeder roads, business regulatory
simplification, strong education and skills training opportunities, well-equipped and staffed
health services, etc. Some of the key constraints which must be addressed to diversify the
economy are described below.
7.
Electricity poses a serious constraint to development as demand outstrips available
electricity. Installed capacity in Angola equals 1913 MW, of which 68% is hydro. The existing
three networks are not interconnected and only 30 percent of the population has access to
electricity of varying quality. The rapid growth of demand for electricity would perpetuate this
gap unless sizeable investments are made to close it. However, a misaligned tariff structure and
poor collection practices-only 40 percent of the services are billed and only 70 percent of the
bills are collected-have led to high government subsidies of around US$1 billion annually.
Utilities serving existing users have not reached operational and financial viability, making it
difficult to promote private sector participation. Nevertheless, the potential to generate power
through hydro is immense (up to 16 GW and the third largest in Africa). Over the medium to
long-term, Angola has the potential to become a major electricity supplier to the Southern
African countries. The Government recognizes that the current condition of the power sector
represents a bottleneck for growth and diversification. It has started the process of implementing
institutional reforms and changes in the organizational structure of the sector. Moreover, the
Government recently adopted a US$23 billion investment plan to increase power generation
and transmission capacity more than threefold by 2017. 6
8.
Angola still suffers from poor road conditions owing to years of destruction and
under-maintenance during the war. Large investments were made to rehabilitate and expand
the road network to a total length of 62,560 km, with public spending on roads averaging US$2.8
billion annually between 2005 and 2009. However, road density remains low, with even some
provincial capitals still inaccessible by road. In addition, feeder roads are non-existent in many
parts of the country. Large investments are still required to improve rural roads to link
agriculture production areas to markets.
9.
Railways and ports systems are undergoing rehabilitation and expansion. The
railway systems used to carry 9.3 million metric tons of freight to Angola's ports in Namibe,
Luanda, Benguela and Amboim, but the freight volumes are currently low. Luanda Port has
been, and continues to be, expanded and reorganized into specialized freight terminals. Although
conditions improved significantly, as processed freight volume increased by more than ten-fold
in the last decade, the port continues to suffer from significant congestion with ships anchored in
the bay weeks at a time waiting to unload. However, as the three main railways soon connect the
ports to the interior of the country and to neighboring countries, they will enable the emergence
of enterprises along the tracks and become an important backbone of Angola's diversified
economy.

10.
Better protection of Angola's natural environment is also an important element of
the country's strategy. Angola is one of the most biodiversity rich countries in Africa with
respect to variety of ecosystems, diversity of flora and number of endemic species.37 The
Medium Term Economic and Social Development Plan (2009-2013) highlights the need for a
systematic management of the principal environmental problems while the National
Development Plan for 2013-2017 sets as a policy goal the implementation of the National
Program for Climate Change.
11.
Angola ranks very low in most international rankings of competitiveness or the
quality of the business environment. The 2011-2012 Global Competitiveness Index (GCI)
placed Angola at 138 out 139 countries, only Chad ranked lower."8 The GCI points to an overall
weak infrastructure (roads, railroads, electricity, and ports). The conditions for competition are
also weak with poor property rights, lack of access to financial services, heavy government
regulation, and political interference in economic life. The country ranks lowest in business
sophistication or technological readiness. According to the IFC Enterprise Survey, corruption is
ranked as the top constraint to doing business, with its significance much higher in Angola than
in SSA. Access to land is the second concern for small and medium farms.
12.
A difficult and burdensome regulatory environment constrains business
development. Angola ranks very low, 172n out of 185 countries, in WBG's 2013 Doing
Business (DB) Report which looks at regulations that apply to small and medium-size
companies. Although some caveats are placed on DB ranking methodology, it is clear that the
regulatory environment for businesses operating in Angola has been challenging. The
Government recognized the need to address the problem and launched various unified singlewindow simplification initiatives such as Guichet Unico and Balcio Unico do Empreendedor.
As a result, it has become easier to start a business and register property. Labor regulations are
rigid, but salaries relatively flexible.
13.
Access to financial services is a major constraint to economic activity and
diversification, despite the rapid growth of the financial sector. The assets of the financial
sector stand at 46.8 percent of GDP. Banking dominates the financial sector, with 99 percent of
the assets. A rapid privatization of the state-owned banking sector has taken place and share of
state banks in total assets had fallen to 7 percent by 2010. The ownership of the existing 21
commercial banks is heterogeneous, and foreign participation is high, making the sector
vulnerable to contagion particularly from Portugal. Loans account for only 35 percent of the total
banks' assets, 80 percent of which is concentrated in 5 largest banks. This is low by international
standards and reflects serious capacity constraints. Lending is concentrated to wholesale and
retail trade as well as construction, with limited lending to the small and medium enterprises.
Indeed, Angola remains largely unbanked with only 11 percent of the population having access
to banking services. There are several micro-finance pilots, but a comprehensive effort to
develop the sector has yet to emerge.

Of the estimated 5,000 plant species, 1,260 are endemic, making Angola the second richest country in Africa in
endemic plant species. The diversity of mammals is also one of the richest on the continent, with 275 species.

14.
Government has made a strong commitment to restore essential services for the
population. This includes increased spending for health and education to improve the
availability of essential inputs such as books, medicines, health workers, and teachers. While
Angola is unlikely to achieve most of the MDGs, there have been impress progress in increasing
access to education and health services during the last decade. For example, primary school
enrollment has increased from 1.8 million children in 2002 to 4.2 million by 2010. In health
outcomes, Angola has generally caught up with other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. As the
Government's efforts to expand and devolve service delivery network to local government levels
continue, attention needs to shift to ensuring improvements in quality of services. Several
challenges need to be overcome:
a. Angola has pursued a strategy to decentralize service delivery. The 2007 Local
Administration Law defined responsibilities for service delivery at provincial, municipal
and communal levels, allowing municipalities to become independent budget units. A
key element of the decentralization strategy was the institutionalization of civic
participation through the Conselhos de Auscultaqdo e Concertaqdo Social and the
creation of Municipal Management Support Fund in 2008 to transfer funds to finance
services and investments identified according to local needs and priorities. The Ministry
of Public Administration started the provision of technical support and training to
municipalities, but capacity remains weak in local governments. 3 9
b. Reducing disparities across Provinces in service standards and outcome has been
difficult. These disparities are to a certain extent a consequence of the war and decades
of lack of investments in the sectors. The increase in inputs has been uneven across
localities, and has not always been accompanied with concomitant improvements in
quality and value for the money.
c.

Securing adequately trained frontline service providers has been a challenge. The
service delivery system experiences difficulties in deploying qualified teachers, nurses,
midwives, and doctors to the interior parts of the country. This contributes to poor
education and health outcomes in less connected provinces and inhibits diversification of
economic activity.

d. Adequate administrative reporting and basic statistical capacity are needed for
accurate planning and monitoring. For example, Angola does not have a functioning
educational management information system (EMIS) or a harmonized health information
system (HIS) to track routine health information. A major challenge in providing an
adequate social safety net is the lack of data required to identify those most in needs. The
Government plans to undertake a population census in 2014 which will contribute to
establishing a comprehensive baseline for service delivery statistics.
15.
Angola has made significant progress towards providing access to improved water
and improved sanitation to its population, in particular in urban areas. But still, about half
of the country's population does not have access to improved water and sanitation, the lack of

Region, Working Paper Series No. 128, October 2009.

which is a major cause of gastrointestinal diseases. An aggressive capital investment program to
expand and rehabilitate water supply systems is ongoing, but institutional reforms to set up costeffective water supply and sanitation utilities are needed to deliver sustainable services. Fifty
percent of the population has access to improved water; 20 percent to piped water. There is a
substantial difference between rural and urban areas. While 60 percent has access to improved
water in urban areas, only 38 percent do so in the rural areas. As for sanitation, 57 percent of
Angolans have access to improved facilities, a percentage higher than SSA average of 31
percent.
16.
Food security is an important priority highlighted in all Government strategies. A
vulnerability analysis carried out in 2003 showed that more than 2.6 million people were food
insecure, of which more than 50 percent belonged to displaced population. Government is keen
on addressing multiple dimensions to food security, including food availability, economic
accessibility, food consumption, utilization, and stability. Indeed, the Government identifies food
security and nutrition as the first objective of its Rural Development and Poverty Reduction
Strategy (2010). Accurate food security data in Angola is sparse, and nationally representative,
comprehensive household-level surveys focusing exclusively on the food security situation have
not been carried out. Available data shows that micronutrient deficiencies are pervasive: 30
percent of preschool children and more than half of pregnant women are anemic; almost twothirds of preschool-aged children are vitamin A deficient; up to 20 percent of young children are
at risk of developing iodine deficiency disorders, and almost half of the population is at risk of
inadequate zinc consumption.
17.
Angola's social protection system is a work in progress which requires substantial
improvements, especially in targeting the poor. In 2004, a Social Protection law was passed
and defined the benefits to be provided under: (i) Compulsory Social Protection for formal
workers to mitigate the impact of unemployment, old age, illness, maternity, etc.; and (ii) Basic
Social Protection scheme to support poor and vulnerable families through social assistance
interventions.
Box 1: THE ECONOMIC COST OF CHRONIC MALNUTRITION
Angola loses approximately US$1.8 billion per year from chronic child malnutrition and deficiencies in several
essential vitamins and minerals. The economic costs of under-nutrition include direct costs, such as the
increased burden on the health care system, and indirect costs of lost productivity. In Angola, 30 percent of
Angolans preschool-aged children have stunted growth which reflects chronic nutritional inadequacies, and is
largely irreversible beyond two years of age. Vitamin A deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are especially
prevalent: in preschool-aged children and pregnant and lactating women and over half of the country's
population are at risk of iodine deficiency. Maternal and child under-nutrition contribute to over one-third of all
child deaths in developing countries such as Angola. Furthermore, children who are undernourished between
conception and two years of age (the period referred to as the "window of opportunity") are at high risk for
impaired cognitive development, which adversely affects national productivity and economic growth. Priority
interventions to address under-nutrition are: (i) behavior change interventions such as promotion of
breastfeeding; (ii) micronutrient and de-worming interventions such as such as providing vitamin A
supplementation for children; and (iii) complementary and therapeutic feeding such as community nutrition
programs.

18.
The current system mainly focuses on formal (and therefore less poor) workers. Social
safety net interventions (within the basic social protection program) also need to be consolidated
and scaled up. Furthermore, even though the law states that the basic social protection scheme is
under responsibility of Ministry of Social Reinsertion (MINARS), there are several key social
51

protection programs under the responsibility of other Ministries and agencies, such as nutrition
programs under the Ministry of Health, School feeding programs under the Ministry of
Education or Public Works interventions under the responsibility of the Social Action Fund
(FAS/Ministry of Planning and Territorial Development). Therefore, coordination of the various
programs is a priority.
19.
Over the last few years, Angola's focus on social protection has shifted. After
focusing on supporting displaced population as well as households and individuals affected by
the Civil War (which displaced about 4.5 million), the Government has now shifted social
protection priorities to address food insecurity, poverty and vulnerability. Currently under the
leadership of MINARS, the Government is developing a social assistance strategy to create a
system to support the extremely poor and vulnerable.
20.
Finally, and pervasively, Angola is faced with a significant capacity gap in
implementing its ambitious development vision to diversify the economy and reduce
poverty. While this situation is common to other post-conflict developing countries, the situation
was particularly dire in Angola as the long-drawn out war prevented the needed investment in
improving governance and institutional capacity. The availability of oil, arguably, had the
perverse effect of easing the financing constraint and reducing the motivation to rapidly
introduce institutions that would increase the efficiency in the use of public resources. Still
public sector and fiscal reforms have taken place beginning in 1999 with the support of the
international community, including the Bank and the IMF. The process initiated then continues
to this day in order to enhance the transparency, efficiency and credibility of public financial
management, strengthen the national statistical system, to improve provincial and sectoral plans,
and to implement the legal framework for public procurement.
21.
The Government is strengthening the capacity of local governments to provide key
services more effectively closer to the beneficiaries. For this reason, the Government stresses the
need to develop home-grown human capital and institutional framework fit for a rapidly
transforming middle-income economy. The task of improving the quality of these essential
public services, while continuing to expand the service delivery system, is putting a significant
strain on the existing institutional and human capacity. Furthermore, in a dynamically
transforming economy, there will continue to be a need to provide social protection to vulnerable
groups who struggle to catch up with the changing environment.

52

Annex 7: CPS Consultations
1.
A series of stakeholder consultations took place in 2012, as the proposed Strategy took
shape, including the two separate consultation meetings with Development Partners (DPs) and
CSOs to discuss the latest strategic orientation of the CPS. These consultations are
complemented by 2012 Bank client survey. The following key themes were discussed during the
consultations:
a. Impact of Civil War: The war is certainly to blame for the current situation but it was
essentially questionable policies that have led to serious structural imbalances in the
economy today. Some of those imbalances have paradoxically been exacerbated with the
end of the war, including in vital sectors such as fisheries and agriculture. For instance,
even during the war, the country could have invested in the fisheries industry, but it didn't.
b. Governance: Two penetrating comments were made on Government strategies and on
corruption. First, Angola already has a number of good strategies. The GoA's Vision 2025
is largely well thought through. The problem is rather the poor implementation, and that is
due to many reasons, including corruption and the erratic nature of the country's policy
environment. There is a sense that corruption, particularity in health and education services,
is severely undermining the efforts of donors. It was recommended that the Bank should
reflect upon corruption more deeply in the strategy.
c.

Agriculture: Participants questioned whether agriculture, especially support to
smallholders, was a genuine priority of the Government. Government seems to favor large
agriculture projects. It is a myth to say Angola has a great agricultural potential because
actually Angola's land is of poor quality and needs a lot of investments to grow crops. Lack
of adequate farming skills is a major constraint to agricultural productivity growth. The
exodus of male adults from rural areas has greatly affected rural productivity. Support
services for agriculture, particularly those normally performed by extensionists are badly
needed. Significant data gaps exist, rendering crop production estimates and even the
amount of arable land to be unreliable.

d. Education: The proliferation of higher education institutions is bringing to the fore serious
quality issues. There is no adequate supervision for the 33 universities in Angola, most of
which are private. The primary and secondary education suffers from widespread
absenteeism. The dropout rates both in primary schools and in the early years of secondary
education attest to a generalized problem that needs to be fixed through profound evidence
based reforms. The current education system does not develop the much needed skills for
the country to tackle its development challenges. Angola has to invest greatly in technical
and vocational education.
2.
Knowledge Bank: Participants applauded the CPS' greater push for knowledge, recalling
that the GoA has consistently been saying that it "needs our brains and not our money". Some
suggested that the Bank should support the development of an Angola-specific knowledge base
which should be used by GoA for informed decision making in areas such as urban poverty,
inequality, food insecurity, agriculture development, youth unemployment, among others. In this
regard, the Bank is well-placed to provide technical and capacity-building assistance for
statistics. However, there was also the view that the expectations about the usefulness of
knowledge support for rational policy-making should be toned down because of unpredictable
nature of how decisions are made in Angola.
53

Annex 8: Key Messages from Assessment of Bank Group Engagement with Angola
StrategicDialogue and Support
1.
Focus the program on helping the Authorities articulate and implement their vision in the
areas that they request support. Various reviews have warned against supply-driven initiatives. A
disperse program taxes the limited capacity of the Government to implement it and may divert resources
from priority programs to the possible frustration of the clients.
2.
The core of any WBG program in Angola should be knowledge intensive. The 2006 IEG
Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) emphasizes the role of the WBG in analytical work and technical
advice, building on a track record of relevant and quality work. Analytical work that is demand-driven, of
good quality and delivered on time can help build the credibility of the WBG as a reliable partner. The
CAE recommended engagement, despite the difficult governance environment.
ProgramDesign
3.
Better appreciation of the political economy context and governance issues should be
reflected in the design of the projects and AAA. Political economy factors affected the implementation
of the ISN program, including the notable delays in effectiveness. Governance and anti-corruption should
be mainstreamed into the design of all new operations.
4.
The design of projects needs to be reconsidered to simplify implementation. In response to
the development needs of the country, the current projects tend to have many components and are
geographically spread out. Taking account of the multi-sectoral nature of the Bank projects, interministerial coordination needs to be ensured.
ProgramImplementation and Monitoring
5.
The WBG should significantly strengthen its presence and impact on the ground. The
business environment in Angola is challenging because of the high operating costs, the limited capacity of
the counterparts, a difficult political economy and in recent years a small WBG program. The ISN
Review stressed the need for a stronger presence on the ground through a well-staffed local office to
guarantee pro-activity of the Bank vis-A-vis the clients, as well as a better understanding of the internal
dynamics in the country. The ISN Review also called for an increased visibility of the Bank in Angola.
6.
The outcomes and results indicators in the next country strategy should be specific,
measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound. In addition, they could be better aligned with the
project development objectives of the active and pipeline operations. Moreover, the progress and results
should be monitored jointly by Government and Bank teams regularly. Bank teams need to pay closer
attention to the implementation risks.
PartnershipCoordination
The partnership within the WBG (IDA, IFC and MIGA) and external partners should be
7.
tightened, especially in areas such as private sector development and infrastructure. The ISN review
notes that the World Bank Group needs to better adapt its business model to pool resources available both
within and outside of the World Bank Group. Closer collaboration with non-traditional partners (i.e.
private companies and BRICs) should be pursued. In addition, local non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) are often implementers of the Government's projects, and they know how to work with the
Government.
8.
WBG's role in donor coordination and aid effectiveness and in harnessing the civil society
should be strongly reinforced. The Bank should continue to lead the donor coordination efforts in the
areas where it has comparative advantage. Strong role is needed also in sectors where it has active
operations (i.e. health, education, infrastructure, agriculture, and water).

54

Annex 9: Potential Activities of IFC, MIGA, and WBI during CPS Implementation
International Financial Cooperation (IFC)
1.
Over the CPS implementation period, IFC could help the Governments achieve long-term
economic growth and better living standards by harnessing the potential of the private sector to
increase access, enhance quality, and improve efficiency in public services. The following
interventions are being contemplated:
2.
Support to improve the overall Investment Climate: Based on an agreement of
responsibilities and contributions, the first step of IFC support would involve working closely
with the Ministry of the Economy and the relevant ministries to jointly undertake a diagnostic
review of the Angolan business enabling environment. The objective of the review would be to
identify key issues and binding legal and regulatory constraints of the Angolan business
environment climate that impede the full participation of potential investors and businesses
(including MSMEs) in the Angolan economy. The review would attempt to answer the question:
what are the key legal and regulatory impediments to the full participation of Angolan businesses
(micro, small, medium or large) in the Angolan economy, and would seek to find solutions to
improving the country's investment climate through regulatory simplification of business
registration and licensing procedures.
Recommendations on the way forward would be
submitted to GoA for approval and adoption. The results of the implementation phase of a
structured regulatory simplification reform project usually counts towards the country's
performance on the annual Doing Business ranking.
3.
Support to improve agribusinesssector: Given the GoA's stated desire to diversify the
economy beyond the petroleum sector, there is clearly also a need to assess the investment
climate from the view of specific industry sectors. As implementation of the overall regulatory
reforms commences, with GoA agreement of responsibilities and contributions, IFC will explore
working with GoA to undertake industry-specific diagnostic review of the business enabling
environment of the agribusiness sectors to determine sector-specific impediments. The
diagnostic would attempt to answer the question - what is necessary to have an Angolan
agribusiness sector that has a meaningful contribution to a fully diversified economy, with the
private sector playing a key role? The diagnostic would help determine the support necessary to
build private sector capacity along the entire value chain, identify and support anchor
investments, ensure access to finance along the value chain, promote supplier and community
linkages, and support value added segments of the value chain. On implementation of the agreed
structured actions required in the business environment of the agribusiness sector, the IFC would
also look to explore investment generation and financing opportunities with the right partners.
IFC would look to explore supporting increased agricultural productivity through development
of sustainable commercial agriculture/agribusiness.
4.
Support for Sustainable Business Development of SMEs: From interaction with the
banks, the analysis is that access to finance per se is not the problem with the inability of
Angolan SMEs to access capital, rather, the capacity of the entrepreneurs to put together their
business plans and financing proposals is the problem. Similarly, interaction with the large
corporate companies in Angola who are trying to localize their supply chains shows that the
ability of most Angolan SMEs to prepare submissions to bid requests and appropriately respond
to procurement proposals is quite limited. In this regard, in conjunction with the private sector,
55

the IFC will explore the deployment of its signature Farmer and SME capacity building
programs, Business Edge4 0 and SME Toolkit4 1 , to both be implemented through partnerships
with Angolan institutions.
5.
IFC would also explore business development for investment opportunities in the
following sectors: financial sector, agribusiness (plantations, large-scale commercial
agribusiness, milling, beverages, activities across the value chain, etc), general manufacturing
and services (e.g. cement, hotels, etc), infrastructure, (in particular, commercial agribusiness
related infrastructure), health services, etc. IFC would also explore PPP advisory opportunities.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
6.
The Authorities have also shown a keen interest in promoting the use of MIGA sovereign
risk guarantees as a way to lower the overall cost of Angola's external borrowing. MIGA
supports foreign investors who undertake investment projects in Emerging economies through
the provision of political risk insurance (PRI). MIGA's current exposure in Angola amounts to
US$524.9 million for projects in the energy and services sector. The PRI instruments used are:
Transfer and Convertibility; Expropriation; War, Civil Disturbance, and Terrorism; Breach of
Contract; and Non Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligations. MIGA PRI helps lenders
improve the risk rating of the transactions in which they participate and thus MIGA PRI
facilitates the financing of the projects in emerging economies. MIGA would be ready to
consider supporting investors and lenders investing in Angola as follows:
*

Guarantee products - particularly focusing on the infrastructure sectors, with priority
projects in energy generation, transmission and distribution to help the Government meet
its development goals. Where projects are undertaken by the Government with private
contractors through a bidding process, MIGA could work with the investors and lenders
to explore the instruments that could be used to achieve the adequate financing for the
projects.

*

MIGA has also identified potential needs in the construction material industry where
foreign private investment and financing is being explored and where MIGA can help
with by providing guarantees related to transfer and convertibility, expropriation, and war
and civil disturbance.

*

The Government of Angola informed the World Bank Group that they are in the process
of creating an Infrastructure Guarantee Fund. Once the Fund is created, perhaps with
support from the World Bank, MIGA could discuss some technical assistance to the
Government of Angola to help organize the operation of the guarantees and assist with
the corresponding training.

World Bank Institute (WBI)
7.
WBI will contribute its knowledge and capacity-building experience to support the
Government at several levels. WBI uses nontechnical approaches that complement technical
solutions to development problems including:
a) Innovation for Development by leveraging the Bank's global reach to developing tools,
methods, and online platforms to facilitate an open and collaborative development
process between governments, citizens, and other stakeholders;
b) Knowledge Exchanges to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences among
development practitioners and policymakers through a dedicated unit that focuses on
South-to-South practitioner exchanges;
c) Leadership and Coalition Building by supporting open and collaborative governance to
strengthen the capacity of government and citizens to facilitate participatory and
sustainable development; and
d) Structured Learning that includes courses, seminars, conferences, webinars and elearning modules covering a variety of topics relevant to international development.

8.
Specific capacity building and knowledge exchange opportunities utilizing WBI
material and RAS support were identified by two key ministries. The Ministry of Territorial
Administration proposed possible support to local and provincial governments, perhaps through
IFAL, and the Ministry of Economy proposed support for capacity and knowledge exchanges for
Public Private Partnerships. A more general level of assistance could be accessed through WBI's
e-leaming curriculum. The e-Institute is a virtual learning classroom and provides convenient
and reliable access to cutting edge knowledge. More than forty-five e-Learning courses address
complex problems in priority areas such as governance, health, cities, climate change, and public
private partnerships. Learners also have access to free monthly podcasts and webinars, video
success stories, multimedia toolkits, and other resources. Very limited content, however, is
currently available in Portuguese and a further review of the content and priorities with key
stakeholders, in order to tailor the programs to the Angolan situation, would be necessary.
