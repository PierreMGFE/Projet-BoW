Foreword

Kenya’s path to shared prosperity

K

enya can be one of Africa’s success stories. Its dynamic private sector, rapidly growing number
of young people, new Constitution and recent peaceful elections are important ingredients in
Kenya’s journey to secure growing prosperity shared across all communities in the coming years.
Yet poverty is high and income inequality persists; 4 out of 10 Kenyans are poor and the richest 10
percent of the population receive 40 percent of the nation’s income.
What will it take to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity by 2030? And how can the
World Bank Group—the IFC, MIGA, and the International Development Association—help in that
journey over the next few years?
These questions shape the World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy which has been prepared
in close consultation with the Government of Kenya, county governments, the private sector, civil
society organizations and international development partners. The report highlights the need for
economic growth to take off at rapid, sustained rates and in sectors that are most likely to reach
the poorest. The private sector can lead the expansion by creating jobs, with Government playing a
constructive role in setting an environment that helps firms operate competitively.
Growth must be inclusive, however, so that prosperity can be shared by all. It cannot be right that
so many Kenyans face a life full of hardships largely because of the place of their birth and family
circumstances rather than their own talents and toils. Inclusive growth requires improving the
health care system, ensuring young people are fit for work, boosting agricultural performance in
low income rural communities, protecting the poor from the impact of disasters and climate-related
changes, and making cities more livable.
Growth should also be accountable. The 2010 Constitution was a major step forward including
provisions to promote gender equality and strengthen anti-corruption and oversight agencies. It
also introduced a decentralization process at a scale never seen before elsewhere.
These are big challenges. We are striving to provide US$4 billion or more of new resources in the
coming years to support the ambitious national agenda in promoting sustained, inclusive, and
accountable growth. The World Bank Group is proud of its long-standing relationship with Kenya,
and looks forward to collaborating with national and international partners—in the public and
private sectors. Working together, Kenya can realize its potential to lift millions of families out of
poverty and become a truly modern economy.

Executive summary

1

Kenya can be one of Africa’s success stories.
It holds great potential including from its
growing and youthful population; dynamic
private sector; a platform for change laid down
by the new Constitution and recent peaceful
elections; and its pivotal role within East Africa
and further afield. Yet poverty remains high with
4 out of 10 Kenyans living in poverty and the
richest 10 percent of the population receiving
40 percent of the nation’s income. Governance
concerns persist; and growth, while solid, has
been constrained by low investment and low
firm-level productivity and has yet to take off at
the rapid, sustained rates needed to transform
the lives of ordinary citizens.
Progress and prospects: Diagnostic review of
the country context and development agenda

2

This strategy is based on a systematic review
of evidence to identify the key challenges
and opportunities for Kenya to accelerate
progress toward the twin goals. The poverty rate

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

fell from 47 percent in 2005 to 39 percent based
on best estimates in 2012. Some social indicators
have improved notably, yet inequality is high
(Gini of 47.4); there are significant differences in
opportunities and outcomes between women
and men, for those living in the remote and most
underdeveloped regions, and ethnicity remains
an important factor in societal development.
Looking ahead, ending extreme poverty by
2030 would imply a cut in the poverty rate of 2
percentage points each year, likely requiring the
economic growth rate to double and inequality
to halve. To unlock rapid and uninterrupted
growth that is sustainable and inclusive, Kenya
must address the key binding constraints of
low investment and low firm-level productivity.
Faster growth needs significant policy reform
to redirect public spending to meet growing
infrastructure needs. It also needs an improved
business environment that encourages private
sector expansion and carefully manages the tax
burden on business.

iii

Vision: Government priorities and
medium-term strategy

3

Kenya wants to be a globally competitive and
prosperous nation with a high quality of life.
“Vision 2030”, a broad-based agenda straddling
the current and previous administration, rests
on three pillars: economic, social, and political.
The economic pillar envisages moving up the
value chain in key areas, including agriculture
and financial services, to consistently deliver 10
percent annual growth. The social pillar focuses
on investing in people, including in education,
health, and housing, and with a focus on
women, youth, and vulnerable communities.
The political pillar seeks to “move to the future as
one nation,” including improving the rule of law,
transparency, and accountability. Vision 2030 is
operationalized by the second Medium-Term
Plan (MTP2, 2013-17), and this national agenda is
entirely consistent with the Bank Group’s global
timeline targeting an end to extreme poverty.
This, together with stakeholder input gathered in
extensive consultations, provides a good anchor
for this Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
Development challenges and opportunities

4

Against this backdrop, achieving rapid
and uninterrupted growth over a decade
or more is the foundational challenge. The
Government’s second Medium-Term Plan
calls for huge investments in infrastructure.
A key opportunity here is to leverage private
sector resources through innovative publicprivate partnerships (PPPs), which are currently
underdeveloped. To underpin a sound
macroeconomic framework, a renewed effort is
merited to help stabilize the wage bill. A more
forceful initiative is needed to improve the
business environment, including tackling some of
the deficiencies pinpointed in World Bank Group

iv

(WBG) analytical work. Much of this change
agenda will only be possible when relevant,
accurate, and timely statistics are produced to
inform policies and help evaluate programs.

5

Placing a premium on human development
is essential from several vantage points.
Growth must be inclusive so that prosperity can
be shared by all. From an equity perspective
it cannot be right that maternal mortality
is among Africa’s highest at 488 deaths per
100,000 live births; and many lack access to
food security, clean water, good healthcare, and
proper housing. Youth unemployment at 21
percent is double the adult average. Equipping
young people with a modern education and
job opportunities is essential to make the most
of their talents. Cities must not only generate
economic activity but also provide basic
services for those who dwell in them. And
the cohesiveness of Kenyan society calls for
renewed efforts to include the marginalized
and disadvantaged. To curb poverty, growth
must take place in sectors where the majority of
the poor live. Investment must be redirected to
projects closer to the poor, including improving
agricultural productivity in rural areas, expanding
and targeting unified social protection programs
that keep people from slipping into poverty,
attracting private sector investment and
participation into education, and improving
service delivery in health at the local level.

6

The changing institutional landscape is
undergoing a tectonic shift with powers
and 30 percent of government revenues
moving from the national government to
the 47 new county administrations. This
transition is truly historic and few countries
have attempted anything on this scale. The

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

forthcoming challenge is to deliver a “devolution
dividend” through greater citizen engagement,
direction, and oversight of public authorities to
fundamentally deliver better services to ordinary
people; building new local governmental
structures that are responsive and responsible;
and fresh inter-governmental relationships,
including resource transfers that translate policy
priorities into meaningful on-the-ground services.

7

All of these opportunities would be
amplified by improved governance and
reduced corruption, or undermined by any
deterioration in the prevailing environment.
In moving forward the WBG will be firm in
its intolerance for corruption and desire for
impunity to end, while setting expectations
sensibly to make step-by-step progress. There
are opportunities to continue improving public
financial management, corporate governance
standards, openness, transparency, and
accountability in government; and to maintain
robust safeguards. Such an “institution-building”
approach will protect not only the integrity
of WBG resources but also Kenya’s internally
generated resources that contribute to 90
percent of all public spending.
Strategic options to make the most
of the WBG assets

8

To help Kenya address these challenges, this
CPS draws on a fruitful country relationship
established over several decades and sets out
how the combined resources of the Bank,
IFC, and MIGA can best help Kenya fulfill its
ambitions of becoming a modern economy
in which growing prosperity is shared across
all communities. The Bank will use a “selectivity
test” that deploys a four-pronged benchmark
to guide the deployment of scarce resources to

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

maximize the prospects of success: (a) confirming
a credible line of sight to make a sustainable
impact on poverty and prosperity; (b) critically
reviewing WBG capability and comparative
advantage, including assessing opportunities
for WBG collaboration; (c) cementing client
ownership; and (d) calibrating client capacity and
accompanying project design. The selectivity
test is used in a cascading fashion to establish
the three domains of engagement, the sectors
within each of the domains, and to make tradeoffs between particular operations and analytical
advisory activities (AAA).

9

The first domain of engagement is
competitiveness
and
sustainability.
Improving infrastructure and the business
environment, while being responsive to
environmental pressures, is the backbone
of long-term growth. WBG policy advice will
help the authorities create a well-functioning
and properly regulated energy market; IDA
financing will be used for some publicly merited
investments; and IFC and MIGA instruments
will help leverage more private resources. More
broadly, the Bank Group will redouble its support
to public-private partnerships, especially in
the water and transport sectors where there is
medium-term potential. On transport, the focus
of new IDA lending will be on significant rural
feeder roads within and between counties to
connect communities to emerging economic
opportunities. Competitiveness can also be
enhanced through improving the business
environment, unleashing the potential of
specific sectors and geographic locations,
and ramping up financing sector and capital
market development. The Bank will support the
Government’s oversight of the rapidly emerging
oil and gas sector. Both IFC and Bank resources
will be deployed to help create private sector

v

jobs and try to make cities livable and sustainable,
with a special focus on secondary cities where
poverty is proving most stubborn.

10

The second domain of engagement is
to protect the vulnerable and help them
develop their potential, which is critical to
sharing in prosperity. Social protection plays
a pivotal role—the Bank’s strong engagement
will be maintained. Health is also a pressing
priority; in this sector the combined resources
of IDA and IFC, alongside global funds and
other partners, will be scaled up. Another key
to help target support for the poor is to focus
on agriculture, a high priority since it has such
a direct link with helping families in rural areas
where a majority of Kenyans live. Potential IFC
investments in infrastructure, agro processing,
and financial institutions further support the
goal. The burgeoning youth population brings
opportunities and challenges for WBG support
in education, jobs, and skills. Protecting the
poor who are disproportionally impacted by
climate variability will also be an area of support.
And across the board the gender focus of WBG
operations and analytical work will be upgraded,
including support for female education,
entrepreneurship, and rural women’s groups.

11

The third domain of engagement focuses
on building consistency and equity. This
is a really long-term drive that has devolution
at its core. The Bank’s large-scale capacitybuilding and AAA program will inform a series
of IDA operations to help counties and national
agencies to make devolution work. Upon
request, the Bank would assemble and manage
a Trust Fund framework to maximize donor
coherence in this fluid arena. IDA investments
will support a more evidence-based approach
to policy making, public spending, and public
administration reform. The consistency of Kenya’s

vi

development will be buttressed by deepening
regional integration with its neighbors; and
WBG investments will be made in multi-country
projects, including in energy and transport.

12

Individually
and
collectively
the
achievement of sustainable development
results will only be possible if they are bound
together through a connecting platform of
garnering good governance, which in some
ways has been an Achilles heel in the past.
The WBG support has at its heart supply-side
capacity building to strengthen oversight
institutions, including support for better public
financial management and for more effective
institutions of accountability, combined with
demand-side accountability such as the use
of open community meetings for beneficiary
engagement. The Bank will continuously
review the impact of project-level governance
measures that have been put in place, scaling
up those that have been effective, including
drawing on input from the WBG’s Integrity Vice
Presidency (INT) on project safeguards and
institutional support to agencies such as the
Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).
The WBG will deploy “corruption calibration” to
its lending program—adjusting areas of focus
and/or scaling back resources in the event of
issues, which threaten the security of IDA and
IFC resource use.
Implementing for results

13

The strategy incorporates a results-focus
in this CPS and in specific operations and
is flexible in responding to new conditions
and information such as updated poverty data
in due course. Targeted outcomes have been
articulated in a multi-sector fashion, reflecting
the interdependence of products across the
strategy. The Bank Group’s efforts to manage for

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

results across the country program are built on
country systems and capabilities for measuring
and monitoring progress. Collaboration across
the Bank Group and with other partners will
be purpose driven in specific areas such as
business climate, financial sector, publicprivate partnerships, energy, and agriculture.
The selectivity test is already pushing the Bank
Group to expand in some fields—such as
supporting secondary cities, promoting rural
development and devolution—and tapering
Bank involvement in others such as highways,
natural resource management, and legal reform.
This process is dynamic, and the assessment will
be continuously updated.

14

The WBG could be providing over US$1
billion per year to Kenya over the life of
this CPS. Careful portfolio management will
continue to be an important ingredient of the
drive for results—with tailored approaches to
suit the particular circumstances of Bank, IFC,
and MIGA investments. IFC is targeting portfolio
expansion perhaps even beyond the US$785
million of commitments at mid-FY14 if market
conditions permit. MIGA’s current total exposure
to Kenya is US$255 million, and international
investors’ interest in infrastructure, power, and
agri-business sectors provides potential for this to
expand further. The Bank’s annual commitments
will be governed by the IDA17 settlement,
provisionally assumed at around US$600 million
each year. This will build on the IDA portfolio in
Kenya of US$4.3 billion at mid-FY14, covering 23
national projects (US$3.5 billion) and 7 regional
projects in which Kenya is a partner (US$0.8
billion). It is important to continue to “move to
scale” especially in IDA investments, but also in
IFC commitments, by focusing on larger projects
and the judicious use of additional finance.

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

Managing risks

15

Any instability in the macroeconomic
environment would probably be the
single most damaging factor to overall
poverty prospects. The mitigation strategy
revolves around the long-term drive to improve
competitiveness and exports, combined with a
prudent strategy on reserves and international
capital access to cope with potential volatility.
Disasters and insecurity, natural or manmade, can be expected to occur even though
their timing and severity typically cannot be
predicted; and the Bank Group and its partners
will seek ways to help cope with such risks in the
future. Other strategic risks include unexpected
changes in political leadership, policy direction
and ministerial leads in key sectors, funding
priorities of other donors, or a loss of appetite
of strategic partners for IFC- and MIGAsupported deals. Each of these would require
nimble re-engagement to prevent changes
unduly affecting the WBG-supported program.
Finally, operational risks include a worsening of
the governance and corruption environment,
including in new county administrations as
their activities expand. The mitigating measures
include (a) the thrust of this CPS to help garner
good governance, including as part of the
devolution process; (b) active cooperation
between INT, the Bank, and the authorities in
order that preventive measures are built into
project design, and allegations when received
are handled firmly and decisively; and (c) good
communication with stakeholders, including
the Board, so due proportionality can be applied
in any strategic response needed by the Bank.

Introduction

1

Kenya can be one of Africa’s success
stories. Its outlook is one of hope and
positive prospects, with huge development
opportunities combined with substantial
challenges. It holds great potential including
from its expanding and youthful population;
dynamic private sector; a platform for change
laid down by the new Constitution and recent
peaceful elections; and its pivotal role within
East Africa and further afield. Yet Kenya’s
poverty rate remains high and governance
concerns persist. Growth, while solid, has been
constrained by low investment and low firm-

level productivity and has yet to takeoff at the
rapid, sustained rates needed to transform the
lives of ordinary citizens. This World Bank Group
(WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
draws on a fruitful relationship established over
several decades. It sets out how the combined
resources of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA can,
in line with the WBG’s twin goals—eliminating
extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared
prosperity—best help Kenya rapidly reduce
poverty and fulfill its ambitions of becoming a
modern economy in which growing prosperity
is shared across all communities.

and development agenda
A. Trends in poverty and shared prosperity

2

This CPS is based on a systematic review of
evidence from within and outside the WBG
as well as an extensive consultation process.
The analytical approach has drawn upon
the emerging principles that guide the new
systematic country diagnostic (SCD) approach.
A formal systematic country diagnostic
document would be premature at this point
and hence has not been developed. A wide
range of perspectives and input from Kenyan
counterparts complements the analysis.
The consultations, which were conducted in
various locations across the country, included
representatives from national government,
county governments, the private sector,
including business leaders, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs); development partners;
and
respected
Kenyan
development
practitioners.

3

Poverty reduction is clearly the single most
pressing issue and while Kenya’s poverty
rate has been falling—from 47 percent in
2005/06 to about 39 percent based on best

2

estimates in 2012/13—several formidable
challenges lie ahead. There is a pressing need
to solidify estimates with more recent data
since Kenya’s last household budget survey
was in 2005/6. The Government intends to
conduct a new survey in 2014, and the Bank
is supporting such plans. Poverty reduction
has been driven by solid growth across
most of the economy, together with some
improvements in social safety nets targeting
the poor and continuing migration to urban
areas—especially metropolitan Nairobi—that
offer better job prospects (albeit largely in
the informal sector) as well as easier access to
health and education services. The distribution
of the nearly 4 in every 10 Kenyans living in
extreme poverty—“Kenya’s bottom 40”—is by
no means even, most notably with a growing
rural-urban split that needs action on both
sides. In the remote, arid, sparsely populated
north-eastern parts of the country (Turkana,
Mandera, and Wajir), poverty rates are above 80
percent; agro-climatic shocks impact vulnerable
livelihoods that depend on livestock and lowproductivity agricultural activities; and people’s
assets, including educational opportunity and

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

achievement, are very limited. The populations
in the western and coastal parts of the
country benefit from better natural resource
endowments; but the poor remain especially
prone to contracting insect and water-borne
diseases, and agricultural potential has been
limited by the effects of flood-induced, land
degradation in certain rural areas.

4

Tackling poverty must address both
the difficulties of low-income, rural
communities and the distinct problems
of urban poverty that also encompasses
secondary cities. The proportion of Kenya’s
poor that live in major cities other than Nairobi
has increased from 17 to 22 percent over
the past decade, suggesting that economic
growth in these urban settlements was unable
to absorb the population growth. And even
though the poverty rate of 22 percent in Nairobi
has been falling and is low compared to the rest
of the country, the absolute numbers of poor
and their concentration in informal settlements
remains high. Across the country women tend
to fare less well than men in many dimensions,
including being much less likely to find a job
in the formal labor market and earning lower
wages when they do. Women in rural areas
have less access to income-producing assets
such as land and credit, and receive lower
incomes for comparable farm work in rural
areas. Poverty is also more prevalent among
large households (the poorest families have 5.2
members compared to 3.5 members in more
well-off households).

5

Income inequality levels are not likely
to have decreased in recent years,
and achieving inclusive growth remains
a development objective. Kenya’s Gini
coefficient of 47.7 is above that of neighboring
comparators, including Ethiopia, Tanzania,
and Uganda. The richest 10 percent of the
population garner 40 percent of the nation’s
income, whereas the poorest 10 percent
Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

receive only 2 percent of national income.
There is domestic interest in addressing this
challenge and the WBG support to promote
shared prosperity meets with a warm reception.
While fostering income growth of the bottom
40 is not currently a target set explicitly by the
national authorities, in practice it is currently
equivalent to fostering income growth of the
extreme poor. The WBG team is working with
the authorities on this challenge, in an effort to
convey the importance of securing a reduction
in inequality as one step toward ensuring that
attainable growth can meet the overarching
target to end poverty in a generation.

6

Significant investment and economic
reform must be part of the effort to cut the
poverty rate by 2 percentage points each year
from now to 2030 if extreme poverty is to be
ended in that timeframe. Simulations—which
will be refined once more up-to-date poverty
statistics become available with Bank support
in 2015—show that both the pace and extent
to which economic growth is inclusive will have
a major influence on the poverty outlook (see
Annex 7). Eliminating poverty by 2030 in Kenya
is beset by two formidable challenges: the rate
of economic growth would need to double;
and inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient,
would need to be halved. If growth remains at
historic levels of around 4 percent per year and
inequality remains unchanged, poverty rate will
fall to 35 percent by 2018 and to 27 percent by
2030, as shown in Table 1. The progress in poverty
reduction depends strongly on what happens
to inequality in the country. If inequality falls
each year by one percentage point, with a GDP
growth rate of 4 percent, the poverty rate would
fall to 28 percent by 2018 and to 11 percent by
2030. Under this inequality reduction scenario,
the goal of eliminating extreme poverty is
attainable if annual GDP growth rates increase
to 6 percent. However, if inequality worsens this
goal would not be tenable in the medium term.

Beyond the poverty data, it is also important
to account for non-income dimensions
of well-being. Kenya has met the targets of
relatively few Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) as analyzed in Annex 7. The recent UN
report on the post-2015 development agenda
has drawn attention to how factors beyond
the direct poverty metric need coordinated
international support. In Kenya, some social
indicators have improved: notably falling
children’s mortality (from 102 deaths per
1,000 live births in 2000 to 73 in 2012), nearuniversal primary school enrolment, and
narrowing gender gaps in education. Some
improvements have been secured through welltargeted interventions such as the extensive
deployment of insecticide-treated bed nets
to guard against malaria, and increased public
spending (albeit not typically used efficiently)
on lower-level education. While prevalence of
HIV/AIDS has been ameliorated thus meeting
the targeted MDG, it is still a pressing issue
for certain segments of the population. But
other indicators remain stubbornly vexing.
Secondary school enrolments are at a low
32 percent, and learning achievement levels
are well below their potential and what is
needed to fuel a modern market economy.
And maternal mortality is among the highest in
Africa with 488 deaths per 100,000 live births.
This prompted an immediate policy response

4

by the new Government to provide maternal
healthcare for free at all public health facilities.

8

There is also an important “jobs lens”
through which to view people’s sense
of engagement in and benefit from the
country’s development. Kenyans rate “tackling
unemployment” as a top priority for the
Government, which in fact has set an ambitious
target of creating 1 million new jobs annually.
Within this target there is a special need for
jobs for the growing youth cohort; each year
more and more young people are graduating
from school and college and facing a rather
despondent task of finding work. Kenya needs
an acceleration of structural change that
creates more high-productivity (modern) jobs
in the formal sector (currently accounting for 1
in 7 jobs). Yet, it must also help grow jobs and
improve conditions in the informal sector, not
least in the family farm and off-farm sectors in
which nearly half of all Kenyans work.

9

Enabling people to realize their potential
and lifting them out of poverty involves,
at the most basic level ensuring that they are
healthy, educated, and have basic life skills to
be able to participate in social and economic
life. This is part of a broader drive to solidify
the nation’s social capital, which has been
enhanced by the widespread support for the

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

new Constitution adopted in 2010, and the free,
fair, and peaceful elections in 2013. The tragic
terrorist atrocities in Nairobi, however, serve
as a reminder of the importance of domestic
security in all its facets, including curbing crime
across-the-board and upholding the rule of law.
B. Drivers and constraints of economic
growth

10

GDP growth has played the main role in
reducing poverty, but the average rate
of 4.6 percent annually over the last decade
is not sufficient to end extreme poverty by
2030. On the positive side, for the first time
in a generation Kenya avoided an “election
disruption” to growth in 2013, helped by the
new Constitution adopted in 2010 that set
the platform for peaceful elections. It has
drawn on its strong track record in economic
management (its 3.9 rating in the Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment was Africa’s
highest in 2012 as well as a prudent debt
position). It has a vibrant private sector and
financial services industry; and IFC increased
the number of transactions per year by a factor
of 4 between FY09 and FY13. The country also
has regionally important assets, including a

financial sector hub, port, and airport. All of
this has delivered decent growth; but, on a per
capita basis, as Figures 1 and 2 show, itis trailing
behind Kenya’s peers.

11

What has held back growth? Kenya has
been hampered by low investment and
low productivity that in turn clog the “export
engine”. There has been a weak contribution
of capital stock to GDP growth as shown in
Figure 2. Private sector investment, at around
15 percent of GDP, is below that of competitors;
and foreign direct investment at 1 percent of
GDP in recent years is far below what could
be achieved (e.g., Tanzania and Uganda attract
foreign direct investment of about 5 percent
of GDP). Public investment has also been
constrained. That is not principally because of
inherently inadequate funding considering
Kenya collects revenue of around 24 percent
of GDP annually—a leader in Africa. That strong
performance has been driven by progress in
economic policy and reform, including the
review and update of the Value Added Tax
(VAT) Law, supported by the US$750 million
IMF External Credit Facility (ECF), which was
completed successfully in December 2013.

Rather a significant share of the tax revenue
has to be deployed on a substantial public
sector wage bill that is high by international
standards. This means that while public sector
development expenditure has edged up over
the past decade, it is constantly under pressure
and needs more room to increase.

12

Low productivity and low returns that
constrain private investment persist for
several reasons. First, essential infrastructure
services such as energy and transportation
are too costly and inadequately supplied.
Second, the environment for doing business,
where Kenya notably lags its competitors,
has weaknesses, including governance
and corruption challenges, and regulatory
frameworks, which in some cases are not
well enforced and in other cases are too
burdensome. Third, human capital has been
improving and is relatively good compared to
many other low-income countries in Africa, but
still many firms—especially those competing
on international markets—cannot secure the
workforce to drive their growth. And fourth,
limited access to finance often with overbearing

6

requirements for collateral (e.g., for rural
businesses), means companies in arid counties
and small entrepreneurs are not grasping
many growth opportunities. This is part of the
broader challenge for the economy to mobilize
domestic savings to direct toward investment
needs. Many of these issues can be addressed
at least in part by policy and market reforms,
emulating some of the positive steps, such as
trade reform and energy market liberalization
that Kenya has taken in earlier years. Good
clear laws backed by a strong and credible
judiciary are an essential element in creating an
environment that is conducive to business and
financial activity to promote credit to a wider
population.

13

To unlock rapid and uninterrupted
growth that is sustainable and inclusive,
the WBG will continue to address significant
binding constraints of low investment and
low firm-level productivity. The Government
has been committed to fiscal discipline and
the primary budget balance of the central
government has remained at reasonable levels.
The authorities seek to re-orient fiscal policy to

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

providing infrastructure investment that lowers
the cost of doing business. In addition the
Government targets improving the business
climate—part of which involves pursuing a
careful tax policy that removes distortions and
avoids undue burdens on private enterprise
that could stifle entrepreneurship. Spending
at national- and county-level government
falls under the Public Financial Management
(PFM) Law and within the Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS),
which should limit the risk of overspending and
emphasize lowering non-priority outlays.

14

Kenya’s public sector debt remained
sustainable with low risk of distress.
Overall, fiscal policy and borrowing decisions
remained in line over the medium-term plans
and its debt management strategy. Kenya’s
external debt has remained sustainable,
largely on account of prudent borrowing on
non-concessional terms while Government
guarantees were limited to energy-related
projects. According to the 2013 Debt
Sustainability Assessment, the Eurobond
issuance planned for the first half of 2014 does
not change the favorable conclusions of Kenya’s
external and public debt position. Going forward,
Kenya has planned a fiscal consolidation path
of achieving a net public debt ratio of about 40
percent in 2017/18 and a deficit of 3 percent
meeting the fiscal convergence criteria of the
East African Community (EAC) Monetary Union
much earlier than 2024.

15

Appropriate monetary policy has kept
inflation within the Central Bank of
Kenya (CBK) target range (5,±2½, percent) for
more than one year while the banking sector
has built adequate capital buffers. Average
inflation in 2013 was 5.4 percent compared
to 9.4 percent in 2012 and 14.0 percent in
2011. After the policy mishap in 2011, the
Central Bank adopted a prudent approach by
keeping its policy rate constant at 8.5 percent
Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

since mid-2012. In the banking sector, banks
are implementing enhanced CBK-prudential
guidelines in advance of the end-2014 deadlines.
Kenyan commercial banks are increasing their
capital adequacy buffers in line with individual
banks’ risk profiles, adopting more stringent
provisioning requirement for non-performing
loans and introducing contingency liquidity
provisions into their planning in response to
revised CBK-prudential guidelines.

16

Kenya’s
external
position
has
substantially strengthened. The high
current account deficit that has afflicted
Kenya since 2005 and exposed its external
vulnerability abated in 2013 to 8.4 percent of
GDP due to tight fiscal and monetary policies,
good weather, and improving exports of
financial services. This also happened in an
environment of a substantial increase in
capital-goods imports emanating from foreign
direct investment in oil-exploration equipment.
Capital inflows and the participation of foreign
investors in domestic bond markets have
increased, attracted by high domestic interest
rates and a stable exchange rate reflecting
strong foreign investors’ interest in Kenya’s stock
market and increased appetite for mediumterm government securities. In addition Kenya
has succeeded in building up international
reserve buffers to above US$6.6 billion around
4.5 months of projected imports despite a large
deterioration of the terms of trade. The strong
external position has increasingly supported the
shilling; improved public debt sustainability has
placed the government in a more comfortable
position to access international capital markets.

17

Several sectors have performed
particularly well, including high-value
horticulture, tea, tourism, financial services,
and emerging ICT—key ingredients in the
modernization of Kenya’s economy. Consistent
with this performance, the IFC has been able to
step up financial investments dramatically—

7

reaching about US$167 million of new business
in FY13 and US$330 million in FY12. Kenya’s
faster growth has gained momentum by its
rapidly growing working-age population, cities
reaching significant scale to reap agglomeration
gains, and the rising predominance of “modern”
sectors. For example, Kenya’s M-Pesa, the global
leader in mobile money transfer systems,
reaches more than 23 million subscribers
or more than half of the population, and
illustrates the power of innovation to make a
dramatic change in people’s lives. Still, foreign
direct investment is limited, exports lag behind
imports (a structural trade deficit that reflects
weak competitiveness), and the private sector
struggles to create one million new jobs needed
each year for the country’s growing labor force.
Infrastructure needs are pressing, firm-level
productivity is low, and weak governance and
a poor business regulatory environment (the

Doing Business rating dropped from 72nd
place in 2007 to 129th place in 2014) stifles
growth and entrepreneurship and holds back
the effectiveness of some public spending.

18

So what is Kenya’s economic outlook?
Can its growth accelerate and be
maintained at a higher level? Yes, but it is a tall
order. The fact that historic growth of just under
5 percent per annum was below potential and
below that of the country’s peers is a good sign
in so far as it shows there is room to improve.
But it also shows that a significant agenda
of policy reform and targeted investment is
needed to accelerate economic performance
across the board. The 2013 WBG report,
“Achieving Shared Prosperity in Kenya,” sets
out systematically where there is considerable
scope for change involving policy and
institutional reforms and greater private sector

participation in key challenges. The country’s
manufacturing base is small and as a share of
GDP (around 10 percent) has hardly risen in
decades—whereas if Kenya were to emulate
the success of global growth leaders among
developing economies, manufacturing would
have to expand dramatically. Improvements
are also needed in the operations of the Port
of Mombasa; in reform of agriculture, especially
agricultural purchasing (the National Cereals
and Produce Board); and in greater efficiency
in public services. How far and how fast those
types of adjustments take place will influence
growth prospects along with global economic
conditions and domestic macroeconomic
policy. The Bank’s central estimates (see Table 2)
for the CPS period anticipate inflation being
controlled and growth averaging about 6
percent per annum. More rapid growth is of
course possible, and the WBG will work with
the Government, the private sector, and other
partners with exactly that aim.

bear the brunt of life-sustaining household
chores such as fetching water and firewood;
this becomes even more challenging without
sustainable land management practices. In the
fast-growing cities (where in fact fertility rates
are typically lower than rural areas, which may
lessen population growth somewhat over the
longer term), the task of providing housing,
proper waste and pollution management, and
security is increasingly complex. Proper spatial
planning and effective urban policies are
essential if migration from the countryside to
the city is really to improve people’s lives over
the long term.

21

Accelerated
growth
will
have
sustainability implications. When the
country won its independence in 1963, its
population was under 9 million and the
pressure on natural resources (and human/
animal conflict) was relatively modest. Now
50 years later, there are more than 43 million
residents, and the population is projected to
grow by around 1 million per year over the
coming 40 years, to be the world’s 20th most
populous nation by 2050 (compared to 31st
today). Although high fertility rates were the
main driver in previous decades, these are now
falling as incomes rise and family planning has
become more prevalent.

Overall the Millennium Development
Goal on sustainability (MDG 7) is
seriously off-track. This is true for several other
MDG targets (see Annex 7). Kenya is vulnerable
to natural disasters and other climate-related
impacts; droughts brought hardship and costs
of US$12 billion over the last decade. Kenya
is classified as “chronically water scarce” with
one of the most degraded areas in the region;
about 70 percent of the population lives in the
small share (about 12 percent) of the country’s
total land area that has agricultural potential.
The growing population and the resulting
increase in demand for land, energy, and water
is putting tremendous pressure on the natural
resource base. These concerns are reinforced
given that Kenya’s natural assets—landscape
and wildlife—are important for the population
as a whole, for some specific indigenous groups
whose livelihoods and culture are so tied up
with the land, and for the pivotal position they
play in the nation’s tourism industry (which
accounts for 2 percent of GDP and 15 percent
of export earnings).

20

22

C. Sustainability

19

Managing population growth, both its
scale and impact, remains a significant
challenge. A majority of Kenyans do not
have reliable access to clean water and good
sanitation. In rural areas women typically
Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

Land issues are contentious and need to
be approached carefully by all interested
parties. The Constitution puts emphasis on
land and the environment, including aiming
to achieve and maintain tree cover of at least

9

10 percent of Kenya’s land area. The National
Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) has
identified restoration of forests on degraded
lands and agroforestry as a ‘big win’ opportunity.
Yet the challenge is to develop and sensitively
implement win-win solutions that properly
handle the rights and position of indigenous
peoples, including those whose long-standing
place of abode is in forest areas.

23

Kenya’s fiscal sustainability over the
coming years has reasonably secure
prospects based on Kenya’s track record to
date. Policymakers would be loath to lose the
hard-won gains from prudent macroeconomic
policy. The potential Achilles heel is the public
sector wage bill, which at over 50 percent
of recurrent spending (compared to SubSaharan African average of 30-35 percent)
and upwards of 7 percent of GDP is higher
than many comparators. It is constantly under
pressure especially now that account must be
taken of former local authority staff salaries
being absorbed by county governments and
national civil servants whose functions have
been devolved but are still on the government
payroll. The move to devolution should not in
and of itself raise public spending, but some
policymakers especially at the county level may
“turn on the spending taps.” It will therefore be
important that public financial management
is strengthened, unnecessary or unplanned
contingent fiscal liabilities are avoided, and
fiscal responsibility is followed as required by
the Public Financial Management Act 2012.

24

Social cohesion requires renewed
attention
to
equitable
access
to opportunities for all regions and
communities, youth, and women as part of the
Government’s ambition for “unity” to ensure
all groups have a proper share in Kenya’s
future. The 2010 Constitution was a major step
forward on women’s rights and provides that
at least 30 percent of all appointees to public

10

bodies are female, including at the county level.
However, there is a long way to go to ensure
that women are economically empowered and
can fully develop their potential (see Annex
12). In agriculture, women comprise more than
70 percent of the labor force, yet they own
only 1-5 percent of agricultural land titles. In
terms of non-agricultural employment, only
29 percent of those earning a formal wage are
women and female youths are twice as likely
to be unemployed as adult females. Girls are
also less likely than boys to enroll in secondary
schools (female-male secondary enrollment
ratio of 92 percent) and are more likely to drop
out due to unfriendly school environments,
early marriages, and the high cost of secondary
schooling. Maternal mortality is one of the
highest in Africa at 488 deaths per 100,000
live births and the proportion of women who
receive child delivery with skilled attendance is
only 44 percent and has remained unchanged
over the last 10 years.

25

To strengthen advancement of Kenya’s
women, this CPS has been informed by
key gender analyses. These analyses include
a recently conducted gender portfolio review
and a poverty and inequality assessment (see
Annex 12). In addition, given that the last
gender assessment predates gender-relevant
provisions in the 2010 Constitution, the Bank
will undertake a Joint Poverty and Gender
Assessment targeted for FY15 that will directly
inform the Kenya country program and ensure
that activities are guided by the most accurate
and up-to-date gender analysis (Box 1). Finally,
support for setting, collecting, and monitoring
sex-disaggregated data is planned in response
to a lack of gender-disaggregated data.

26

How well Kenya’s youth fare in the
coming years will also have a significant
bearing on social cohesion. On the positive
side there is a huge demographic dividend
whereby some 26 million Kenyans (more than

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

one-half the population) are below age 25, and
this ratio will rise to almost two-thirds by 2030.
More broadly it is economically productive
adults (15-64 years) that are the fastest growing
cohort, yielding a massive improvement in the
dependency ratio over the coming decades
(Figure 3). If these citizens—especially the
young—are equipped with the skills and
competencies for the changing marketplace
and secure gainful work, they will provide a
huge boost to productivity and output. But if
too many of them fall from this path, there is a
risk of social capital being undermined by crime
and delinquency. That is why it is so important
for the private sector to create jobs and for
young people to continue their education and
acquire skills to fit those jobs.
D. Institutions and governance

27

The institutional and governance
environment plays a part in the
nation’s performance and how the WBG
program unfolds. Kenya has a mixed record

on governance performance, falling below
the average for SSA countries in the World
Governance Indicators, except in government
effectiveness and regulatory quality (see Annex
9 for an overview of governance issues). Ratings
in surveys such as those from Transparency
International (where Kenya was rated 139
out of 174 countries in 2012) and extensive
media coverage of governance and corruption
justifiably draw attention to the issue. Likewise
for the WBG, there is emphasis on tackling these
issues, including taking measures to safeguard
the use of WBG funds in projects, where
deepened collaboration between the Bank’s
Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) and
the Kenya National Audit Office has proven
fruitful. The WBG has addressed the aftereffects of somewhat contentious experiences
with past (and closed) projects (that dealt with
education and arid lands) where referrals have
been made to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption
Commission (EACC).

BOX 1: Gender focus: Enabling women to help themselves, their families, and their country
Inclusion of women fully in Kenya’s development is sensible from its intrinsic value of equal rights and its support
for faster economic growth by helping all citizens, male and female, to achieve their greatest potential. The
current development context in Kenya—devolution, the Constitution, and other policy reforms—offers compelling
opportunities to advance these values. With the adoption of the new Constitution, women and men now formally
have the right to equal treatment and opportunities in political, economic, cultural and social spheres without
discrimination. The Constitution provides that not more than two-thirds of members of elective public bodies be of
the same sex and also provides for numerous other rights for women, including those related to citizenship, marriage/
divorce, land, and public service opportunities. However, there is still progress to be made in ensuring that women are
able to realize these rights in practice.
The WBG, through the IDA portfolio, IFC investments, and analytical work is supporting key gender issues. A recent
gender portfolio review estimated that 76 percent of active and pipeline IDA operations are gender informed. The
current strategy builds on the previous CAS period that saw a focus on gender issues in agriculture, health, education,
and social protection, with proposed indicators for each of these areas. WBG support has helped generate tangible results:
a 10 percent increase in incomes for both female and male small-holder farmers; the provision of basic health, nutrition,
and population services to over 21 million women; employment for 40 percent of interns benefiting from the Youth
Empowerment Project (both female and male); and the provision of cash transfers to 56,000 orphan and vulnerable children
households. The IFC SME Banking Advisory Program improves the availability of financial services to women by training
commercial bank staff and supporting specific products aimed at women. The current CPS results framework includes
gender-related outcome indicators in health services and water (see Outcome 5 in Annex 1, CPS Results Framework).

It would be wrong to paint too gloomy
a picture of governance problems. But
realistically, the governance analysis in this CPS
shows that these problems have deep-rooted
causes in accountability (or lack thereof ),
including vested interests, elite capture, and
weaknesses in institutions of accountability that
encompass the legal and judicial system and
enforcement agencies. But in some respects
it is the vibrancy, openness, and international
connectivity of the media and civil society in
Kenya that bring these issues to the attention
of a much wider audience than perhaps is
experienced by other countries with similar
patterns of corruption. Many businesses do
operate effectively; for example, IFC has been
able to expand its business without governance
issues grinding things to a halt. The country
has an almost unparalleled openness among
its peers in making public appointments,
including Cabinet ministers, senior civil servants,
and vetting of judges when replacement is
necessary. A strengthened Ethics and AntiCorruption Commission (EACC) and more
creative and extensive use of technology can
increasingly provide “sunshine” transparency
(of public oversight) on public spending
and other aspects of official public life. The
2010 Constitution has strengthened existing

12

2020

2025

2030

2050

institutions and created new ones for oversight,
including the Controller of Budget (who
authorizes release of funds and is appointed
on an eight-year, non-renewable tenure) and a
reforming and independent Judiciary.

29

Devolution in Kenya is a huge change
in the institutional landscape. The 2010
Constitution provided for the creation in 2013 of
47 new county governments with considerable
oversight of affairs in their jurisdictions (see
Annex 10 for the challenges and opportunities
of devolution). If implemented successfully,
it can, over the long term have a positive
impact on governance and the promotion of
shared prosperity. By bringing government
closer to the people and enhancing local-level
accountability mechanisms, governance can be
improved; this will not happen automatically
but rather requires specific actions,
including establishing strong public financial
management and budget transparency within
county administrations. By improving and better
targeting service delivery (such as education,
core public services, local infrastructure) at
the county level, local citizens and companies
will benefit. There is considerable variation in
capacity and resources among the counties,
which will take a concerted effort to address.

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

The new structures provide an avenue for
a clearer and more equitable allocation of
national resources across counties, which
should help less-developed regions.
E. Regional dimensions

30

The country diagnostic would not be
complete without recognition of the
distinctive position Kenya holds in East
Africa. The country is a leader and connector
within the East African Community (EAC), not
least through its facilitation of regional trade,
investment, and flow of skills across borders.
But for it to become an economic powerhouse,
Kenya must tackle key obstacles, among which is
remedying major transport corridors, including
border crossings that remain tortuous and hold
back growth in neighboring countries (which
in turn would benefit Kenya). Solidifying peace
and security right across the Horn of Africa
will also be of mutual benefit for Kenya and its
neighbors. The new Government has affirmed

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

its regional credentials, according considerable
importance to cross-country collaboration
as a way to promote economic development
and security. President Kenyatta has formed
active alliances with his counterparts to push
forward specific initiatives, including transport
connectivity, and to harmonize financial sector
frameworks and infrastructure in the EAC. These
last two initiatives are supported by the Bank’s
regional (multi-country) portfolio that has
expanded considerably, albeit with growing
pains (slow start up and disbursement). IFC
clients and sponsors are increasingly being
sourced from within Africa as well as among
its global network. Some Kenyan enterprises
such as those in financial services have made
significant cross-border investments facilitated
by IFC engagements. There is therefore potential
to do more on regional issues; and while the
transformative effect can be substantial over
the long term, the costs and difficulties in
delivering this must not be underestimated.

II. Vision and framework: Government priorities and
medium-term strategy

31

By 2030 Kenya wants to be a globally
competitive and prosperous nation with
a high quality of life for its citizens. This clear
ambition is encapsulated in “Vision 2030”, a
broad-based agenda straddling the current and
previous administrations. The Vision provides a
framework for this CPS. It rests on three pillars:
economic, social, and political. The economic
pillar envisages creating a modern economy by
moving up the value chain in key areas, including
agriculture and financial services, to consistently
deliver 10 percent annual growth. The social
pillar focuses on investing in people, including
in education, health, and housing, with a focus
on women, youth, and vulnerable communities.
The political pillar seeks to “move to the future
as one nation, ”including improving the rule of
law, transparency, and accountability.

32

Vision 2030 is operationalized by the
Medium-Term Plan (MTP), which drives
policy actions, public investment priorities,
and expenditure planning. Its second edition,
MTP2 (2013-17)—“Transforming Kenya”—was

14

launched by the new administration in October
2013. It is clear that MTP2 is a sensible anchor
for a good deal of the WBG work, including how
IDA, IFC, and MIGA investments help leverage
job creation. But WBG will need to have its own
approach to selectivity in the deployment of its
resources since it cannot match the appropriate
comprehensiveness of the MTP2. The MTP2
and the Vision 2030 results framework provide
a good anchor for the CPS to ensure solid
monitoring of results of Bank-supported
interventions with a clear line of sight to longerterm development results.

33

Overall this national agenda is entirely
consistent with the WBG aspirations.
The global timeline targeting an end to
extreme poverty is aligned with Kenya’s overall
approach. Although the country has not
explicitly proposed monitoring the growth in
incomes of the bottom 40 percent (who are in
fact those currently living below the poverty
line), this focus resonates with the thrust
of the domestic strategy. Policymakers are

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

concerned—including for reasons of societal
cohesion—and want to ensure that all groups
share in advancing prosperity. And within the
population, they have highlighted several
segments, including the prospects for women
and the rapidly growing youth cohort.

34

It is important to enrich the
understanding of this national vision
with other sources of views from key
stakeholders in Kenya’s development. For this
reason the CPS has been informed by client
and stakeholder views summarized in Annex
13. Dialogues and meetings with national and
county governments have been held in various
locations across the country. In many respects

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

their views were consonant with the country’s
broad vision while providing additional insights
into particular points of emphasis such as how
to deliver “One Kenya” for women and men
alike; dealing with the special challenges of
youth; recognizing the intricate features of
governance; and liberating the dynamism
of the private sector, including by sensible
tax policy at national and county level that
avoids excessive or distortionary burdens on
firms. Other feedback emphasized the issue of
making devolution work, ensuring that WBG
support helped as many counties as possible,
especially those communities in the greatest
need, and finding new methods of working
with the counties.

III. Development challenges and opportunities

35

Some of Kenya’s challenges are not
new, and many exist similarly in other
WBG client countries. Yet there are certain
distinctive features that have been identified in
the systematic diagnosis of key constraints and
opportunities relevant to the CPS timeframe.
Those distinctive features provide one thrust
(but not the only criteria) that accounts for
how this CPS implements a selective approach
to how the WBG deploys its resources going
forward.

36

Kenya’s newly elected Government has
a change mandate from an impatient
citizenry, yet arguably with no diminution of
the clientilism and interest group pressures
that have influenced politics and business for
decades. There is potential within a burgeoning
private sector, including the most effective of
operations in fields as diverse as horticulture,
tourism, power generation and transmission,
and signs of significant new resources in the
extractive industries sector. Financial services
innovations are particularly impressive, such
as M-Pesa that leads the world in “mobile

16

money for ordinary citizens,” and in deepening
stock exchange and capital markets. There are
openings for Kenya to punch at a higher weight
in regional East African Community activity—
both in the public and private sectors.

37

The
new
Constitution
provides
opportunities to implement major shifts
in Kenya’s institutions to improve how they
serve the public. With broad public support, the
Constitution intends to accelerate development
outcomes, reduce spatial inequality, and
strengthen governance. Several key changes
that it heralds are significant (Box 2) and set
the scene for shaping how WBG input can help
embed these changes over the coming year.

38

Against this backdrop, achieving rapid
and uninterrupted growth over a
decade or more is the foundational challenge.
Based on this diagnostic review in Kenya,
there are prospects for maintaining a sound
macroeconomic framework that needs, in part,
prudent control of the public sector wage bill;
but, this is linked with wider issues of equity

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

Box 2: A 50th birthday present: How the constitution opens new doors for Kenya
Kenya’s original Constitution adopted upon independence in 1963 provided a degree of stability in the subsequent
decades, but its weaknesses in serving a modernizing and ambitious Kenya were becoming more apparent as
time passed. The 2010 Constitution establishes significant new provisions in several areas including gender equality
(where women are achieving fairer representation in elected chambers and executive positions, although there is still
a fair way to go) and governance and the rule of law (where anti-corruption agencies are empowered more solidly).
To improve public administration broadly, changes include a strengthened legislature and new senate; initial reforms
in the judiciary; increased emphasis on transparency, participation, and accountability; and an ambitious devolution
that transfers significant resources and responsibilities to 47 newly elected county governors and county assemblies.
The March 2013 elections allowed the implementation phase to begin in earnest—an immense task of converting
Constitutional provisions and laws into functioning institutions. The first steps in this daunting journey have been
positive: election process issues are being resolved in court; public vetting of key leadership positions, especially in
the judiciary, has increased; and devolution has largely proceeded according to Constitutional timetables, albeit with
fits and starts.

and public service efficiency. The Salary and
Remuneration Commission is in the forefront of
trying to resolve wage demands in the public
sector. How this Commission resolves labor
disputes and helps stabilize the wage bill will be
a test of fiscal resoluteness. At the same time,
Bank-supported analysis of the delivery of public
services has pinpointed glaring deficiencies
in the way resources are deployed such as a
troubling number of teachers failing to be
present in the classroom for the equivalent
of two days per week. All this points to
public sector modernization as a continuing
area of emphasis.

39

The long-term economic engine is the
private sector—including the large
segment of informal activity—whose energy
and dynamism should be the principal
source of growth and where there are
significant opportunities. As part of its dayto-day business, the IFC has seen that several
important sectors are attractive in their ability
to create jobs, make an impact on poverty,
and be commercially viable. These sectors
include financial services, infrastructure, ICT,
education, agriculture and food processing,
and manufacturing. All these sectors are part

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

of a modernization in the economy’s structure.
Overall firm-level productivity nevertheless
remains low, constraining firms’ abilities to grow
and generate employment.1

40

Hence, progress on investment climate
reforms, combined with improving firmlevel productivity and innovation, is essential
to raising private sector investment and job
creation. Moving vibrant sectors to the next
level and critically ensuring that they are able to
compete internationally, thus boosting Kenya’s
lagging exports, needs a mixture of capital
and expertise from domestic and international
partners. But beyond individual opportunities
for the marketplace to grow across-the-board,
the Government needs to deepen and build
on the strengths of the financial sector and
be much more forceful in improving the
business environment. The WBG analytical
work identified some of the deficiencies that
need boosting: weak contract enforcement,
overly regulated sub-markets (e.g., maize), and
a stagnating manufacturing base. Innovation
and competitiveness programs in key sectors
could be helped by public support for science,
technology, and higher education.

17

41

The bottlenecks to private sector
dynamism go well beyond the policy
environment and are equally if not more
rooted in on-the-ground realities of poor
infrastructure; hence, leveraging private
investment in infrastructure is essential and
compels WBG engagement in the publicprivate partnership (PPP) agenda. Firms are
currently faced with high transport costs given
dilapidated roads and railways, and a cloggedup Mombasa port: the average cost to export
a container is US$2,255, compared to US$1,620
in South Africa, US$660 in Mauritius, and
US$456 in Singapore. In addition, firms pay high
energy costs at $0.21 per Kwh (versus per Kwh
of $0.18 in Nigeria, $0.10 in South Africa, and
$0.08 in China and India). To this end, the MTP2
identifies huge investments in infrastructure
(roads, national railways, urban transport);
energy; and agriculture among other areas. A
fraction of these can legitimately be met from
public resources, including those from IDA. But
the real opportunity here is to leverage private
sector resources through innovative publicprivate partnerships, which are currently rather
underdeveloped. Parts of the legal framework
for designing and executing PPPs are in
reasonable shape. Hence specific transactions
(including those with joint Bank, IFC, and MIGA
support—see Annex 8 on WBG collaboration)
in the power sector, for example, have been
successfully arranged. More can be done on
financing power generation and distribution
yet the trick is now to expand and widen this
approach. In terms of other infrastructural
priorities, institutional and policy reforms with
complex political economy considerations are
long-needed such as liberalizing the grain and
maize market.

18

42

The effect of many of these actions on
growth, and ultimately on poverty, can
only be properly traced when relevant and
accurate statistics are made available in a
timely manner to policymakers and the general
public alike. Such an approach is an essential
component of evidence-based policymaking
and for monitoring and evaluating development
impacts of programs being implemented. While
Kenya has some strong statistical data, there are
gaps (see Annex 11—Statistics for Results). The
last MSME census was in 1999, and a nationwide
household survey—central to reliable poverty
data—was last conducted eight years ago.
Action is needed to rectify this situation in the
near-term, and to improve statistical coverage
(including gender disaggregation where
relevant), accuracy, dissemination and usage
over the longer term.

43

Placing a premium on human
development is essential from several
vantage points. Critically, as the analysis in
section 2 demonstrated, growth on its own
almost certainly will not be enough to the deliver
the “poverty yield” that Kenya seeks. Inroads
must be made in inequality, and that is more
productively achieved by empowering those at
the lower ends of the distribution to move up
than by squeezing the top. Furthermore, from
an equity perspective, it cannot be right that
so many Kenyans face a life of full of hardships
largely because of the place of their birth and
family circumstances rather than their own
talents and toils. Enhancing people’s skills and
capacity also allows them to become part of a
better-qualified workforce needed to elevate
firm-level productivity.

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

44

There is an opportunity to make
progress in improving public services
that have a direct impact on people’s wellbeing. Healthcare may be foremost in this
regard, given that the Government—and new
county administrations—are behind a program
of health reform. Although total national
spending on healthcare, at around 5 percent
of GDP is not low by comparable international
standards, the effectiveness of such spending
requires attention. Improved healthcare tends
to be accompanied not only by better health
status but also by lower fertility rates over the
medium term. There is a great opportunity to
help build better systems, including a stronger
reliance on results-based healthcare financing
at the local level, to leverage change. The central
challenge in education is similar: apply resources
more effectively and lift quality of outcomes
rather than quantity of inputs. There is scope
to attract more private sector investment and
participation into health and education. Pointers
can be taken from IFC’s financing of a private
sector service provider in Kenya and structured,
social-service PPPs in other parts of the world.
A brighter picture can be seen on social
protection policy, where solid foundations have
been laid to harmonize the somewhat disparate
cash transfer programs and target those even
more closely on poor households. This Banksupported initiative is beginning to bear fruit
now and should continue to do so over the next
several years.

45

In promoting human development, the
Government has heightened its emphasis
on youth and youth jobs. Several schemes
have been floated, including establishing
“Institutes of Technology” in every ward of the
country, and allocating 2.5 percent of national
revenue to a “Youth Enterprise Capital Fund”.

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

From a private sector perspective, there may be
interest and potentially growing involvement
from companies who want to work alongside
the public sector in creating jobs, such as those
in the Bank-supported Youth Empowerment
Project, to educate and train young people so
they fit those openings. WBG is engaging the
Ministry of Education’s new PPP unit as well
as other development partners, and exploring
mechanisms with which to strengthen industryacademic linkages. Because the initiatives are
so new, it is important to evaluate progress
critically and adapt quickly as needed.

46

For Kenya to make a huge dent on
poverty, support for the growth and
realization of people’s potential must focus on
sectors and locations where the majority of
the poor can benefit. In rural areas, the single
biggest and most sustainable impact would be
to improve agricultural performance. This is the
area where the private sector has an important
role to play in raising incomes by financing small
farms, ensuring equitable access to markets,
lowering risk and optimizing value chains. The
agricultural agenda, of course, is very much tied
up with Kenya’s competitiveness, and policy/
institutional reforms are needed to lift certain
constraints to growth. There is considerable
room to improve agricultural productivity,
including through more effective extension
services, sustainable soil management practices,
better livestock management (a critical subsector for many of the poorest arid and semiarid counties) and better management of
market, production, and enabling environment
risks. Basic rural infrastructure, notably access
roads and irrigation, needs a huge upgrade.
Finally long term enhancements to the use
of land resources are called for, such as those
facilitated by efficient land registries and

19

secure tenure. The rural poor would also gains
from community driven development which
empowers local people, including women and
marginalized groups, to take charge of their
own fortunes. In other cases mechanisms such
as formal social safety nets, including cash
transfers, food security for the most vulnerable,
and sustainable land management support can
make the best impact.

47

In cities it is essential to engage the
private sector to help put in place better
infrastructure, housing, health and education
to serve the growing population. The
prospects and approaches for doing this must
be tailored to specific conditions. In the largest
and relatively more prosperous cities, PPPs
will become increasingly tenable (subject to a
solid regulatory framework); and putting these
in place will deliver better services and have a
demonstration/knowledge-sharing dimension
for elsewhere in the country. In the emerging
secondary cities, there is a chance for public
agencies to invest right at the outset to lay the
platform for manageable growth over the long
term. And whether in the countryside or on
urban streets, the poor are most exposed to the
impacts of disasters, thus making it important to
strengthen disaster planning and management.

48

The changing institutional landscape
is undergoing a tectonic shift with
powers and responsibilities moving from
the national government to the 47 new
county administrations. The Bank provided
a “Devolution without Disruption” report
and supports implementation through the
Accountable Devolution Trust Fund. This
transition is truly historic and by no means
easy—few if any countries have attempted
anything on this scale or speed in the recent

20

past. The Constitution envisaged transferring
functions gradually over three years, but most
county functions have already been transferred
along with approximately 30 percent of
government revenues rather than the
Constitutional minimum of 15 percent, leaving
some national government functions potentially
under-funded. At this pace, the changes could
bring about risk of service-delivery disruption,
including in devolved functions like urban
management, water, health, agriculture, and
local roads.

49

Devolution challenges will likely persist
throughout the CPS period, as reviewed
in Annex 10. These include:
• Major capacity challenges to get core county
planning, PFM, and HR systems in place.
• Risks in the largest cities that have inherited
significant payroll and debt obligations, at
the same time as reduced central transfers.
• Unique challenges of historically marginalized
areas. Larger transfers to counties in arid and
semi-arid regions provide an opportunity
to address long-standing infrastructure and
service delivery gaps. But these counties
typically face major capacity gaps.
• Sectors that are being devolved to counties
the fastest, including health, agriculture, and
local infrastructure service delivery.
• Implementation of constitutional and legal
provisions on incorporating transparency and
citizen participation into county (and urban)
planning, budgeting, and performance
management systems.

50

While it is essential to minimize what
will be inevitable hiccups over the
next several years, the real challenge is to
deliver a “devolution dividend”. That dividend
will be manifested through greater citizen

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

engagement, direction, and oversight of public
authorities to fundamentally deliver better
services to ordinary people and build better
local-level business environments. Maintaining
expectations is important as devolution is a
long-term process that goes well beyond this
CPS period. At the local level it involves building
new governmental structures, institutions, and
systems that are responsive and responsible; and
fresh inter-governmental relationships, including
resource transfers that translate policy priorities
into meaningful on-the-ground services.

51

In practice, the needs and opportunities
for institutional improvement vary
across the levels of agencies involved in the
devolution landscape. At the central level,
ministries—especially the Treasury and the
Ministry of Devolution—have to build capacity
to oversee a new way of doing business in which
a large share of national tax revenue is passed to
county administrations. The approach has to be
“lean and mean” (there is no point building local
public administration if central government also
expands) yet effective in rigorous public financial

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

management and sensible fiscal discipline. At the
county level, the 47 units need to develop their
own ability to be responsive and accountable,
not least through transparency in resource use
and active citizen engagement. They must also
find ways of working together, perhaps through
the Council of County Governors, so they can
exploit synergies on cross-boundary issues,
such as sub-regional (multi-county) business
competitiveness, and promote learning from
each other.

52

The 2010 Constitution ushered in other
major changes to help reinforce the
institutional “pillars of integrity”. Alongside the
Public Financial Management Act (2012), it has
clarified roles and responsibilities of the Office
of the Auditor General, created the Office of the
Controller of Budget, and increased the checks
and balances with stronger oversight by the
legislature over the executive. Furthermore, the
judiciary has been strengthened with greater
independence, with the roles of Chief Justice
and Supreme Court undergoing transformation
to improve their judicial performance.

IV. Strategic options to make the most of Wbg assets

A. Aligning with WBG win goals and being
selective

53

The WBG-supported program in Kenya
aligns with the WBG twin goals and
must be—and will be—selective against a
wide-ranging national agenda. The MTP2, for
example, identifies 38 areas of intervention,
and its results framework sets as many as 292
targeted outputs. What is the best way of doing
this? The Bank will use a selectivity test that
deploys a four-pronged benchmark to guide
deployment of its scarce resources to maximize
the prospects of success. Specifically:
• Confirming a credible line of sight to
make a sustainable impact on poverty
and prosperity. Selectivity will be driven by
the degree in which interventions directly
target the poor, whether there is evidence to
show that the expected economic benefit is
substantial, taking into consideration, where
appropriate, creating jobs and helping poor
beneficiaries, including women.

22

• Critically reviewing WBG capability and
comparative advantage (including assessing
opportunities for collaboration). The role of
other development players will be important
in assessing how the WBG can add value. This
benchmark also examines whether the WBG
has an established track record in the suggested
areas of intervention and, if not, whether an
experienced team can be deployed.
• Cementing client ownership. The existence
of a forceful, meaningful, and formal request
from the relevant line ministry and Treasury,
the intervention’s inclusion in the MTP2, and
a review of any resistance to the proposed
intervention are some considerations that will
gauge the level of client engagement.
• Calibrating
client
capacity
and
accompanying project design. The track
record will be reviewed regarding adequate
client capacity in relevant line ministries,
credible
procurement
and
financial
management resources and expertise,
integrity and corruption concerns, and how
gaps in the above can be addressed and built
into project design where needed.

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

54

This selectivity test is used in a
cascading fashion. First, broad domains
of engagement have been established that
are drawn from the systematic diagnosis of
constraints and opportunities highlighted
above(see Figure 4 and Annex 15). A limited
set of specific and measurable outcomes
within each domain of engagement have been
identified, in line with the Government of Kenya’s
key strategic vision. These targeted results help
identify sectors within these domains that will
be given priority. Conversely, as sectors gain
higher priority, selectivity inevitably means
that WBG will scale down or not engage in
some areas. And in implementing the CPS, the
selectivity test will be applied to make detailed
choices on particular operations and analytical
advisory activities (AAA).

B. Focus of engagement

55

The overall strategy will move forward
with three domains of engagement:
• Competitiveness and sustainability –growth
to eradicate poverty;
• Protection and potential –human resource
development for shared prosperity;
• Building consistency and equity –delivering a
devolution dividend.

56

Individually
and
collectively,
the achievement of sustainable
development results will only be possible if
they are bound together through a connecting
platform of garnering good governance,
which in some ways has been an Achilles heel
in the past. More needs to be done on both
the demand and supply side of governance.

FIGURE 4: Kenya CPS (FY14-18) - Three domains of engagement bound together by a connecting platform
Building Consistency and Equity

Garnering Good Governance

Protection and Potential

Competitiveness and Sustainability

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

23

On the demand side of good governance, WBG
interventions in the main domains will also
build on governance-related dimensions such
as transparency, accountability and openness,
third-party monitoring, and increasingly robust
public financial management. On the supply
side of good governance, accountability will be
built through strengthening critical institutions
and processes such as the Parliamentary Budget
Office, Auditor General, Controller of the Budget,
new county assemblies, and citizen participation
in key issues. This is an area where the input and

expertise of the World Bank Institute (WBI or its
successor) will be particularly valuable.

57

The results-based focus helps define
the country program and its selectivity
within each domain. The overview is shown in
Figure 5, with details in Annex 1. Each domain is
discussed in specific sections that follow, which
conclude with a summary of specific results
being targeted (as shown in the overviews by
domain in Figures 6, 7, and 8).

C. Domain one: Competitiveness and
sustainability—growth to eradicate poverty

58

On competitiveness and sustainability,
enhanced infrastructure and logistics
are the backbone of long-term growth. This
is, however, a wide-ranging agenda; the MTP2
envisages investments upwards of US$43
billion over the next five years. Hence, the WBG
is establishing some early priorities that are
ambitious but not over-reaching. In the energy
sector, WBG collaboration and long-established
relationships with public and private sector
partners will be expanded (Box 3). WBG policy
advice will help the authorities create a wellfunctioning and properly regulated market

and continue to provide technical assistance
to selected government agencies. Support will
extend to Kenya’s cooperation with neighboring
countries to facilitate energy cooperation,
including through common technical standards
and power-pool trading. IDA financing will be
used for some publicly merited investments,
in the first instance targeted at electricity
modernization through upgrading of selected
transmission and distribution networks that
will hugely improve technical and billing
efficiency. IFC and MIGA instruments will
help leverage more private resources, most
notably in independent power production and
renewables, perhaps also including geothermal
sources. IFC, if market conditions allow, is open

Box 3 : Three is better than one: WBG collaboration powers ahead
Over the last couple of years, the three WBG institutions along with MIGA, IFC, and IDA have pulled together pathbreaking combinations of financial support in specific private-sector deals that are creating new power supply
for the citizens of Kenya. In Thika Power and Triumph Power, MIGA has provided political risk insurance to make the
projects bankable and attract foreign investment into Kenya. IDA has complemented that with a partial-risk guarantee
supporting short-term liquidity. And IFC has underpinned it with direct investments into the private companies
building and operating the new power plants. Thika Power itself will bring 87 megawatts of power on line with a 20-year
power purchasing agreement. Just as importantly, a clear precedent has been set to demonstrate to the private sector,
Government, and the WBG, that working together facilitates long-term investment and produces more results for all
the players involved. Altogether, WBG engagement in the energy sector targets adding 2,300 MW installed generation
capacity from diversified sources.

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

25

to substantially increasing its investments in
infrastructure by drawing on an impressive
network of investors that it has already built up.
MIGA guarantees, which have recently been
made more flexible to better cover breach of
contract and state-owned enterprises, will also
be marketed actively. A summary of the results
for Domain One is in Figure 6 at end of this
subsection.

59

More broadly the WBG will ramp up
its already considerable support to
public-private partnerships, especially in
the energy, water, and transport sectors
where there is medium-term potential.
This assistance is grounded in the recently
commenced Infrastructure Financing and
Private Public Partnership Project that builds
capacity of the enabling regulatory and
institutional framework, including the Treasury’s
PPP unit. It also pushes the agenda through
extensive analytic work, including detailed
legal and operational lessons from comparable
experience in other regions, especially SouthSouth exchanges. As the Government’s PPP
pipeline solidifies, WBG will have a greater
“transactions focus,” exploiting the synergies
between IFC instruments, complemented by
MIGA products, and potential IDA leveraging.
One example arises with the Governmentproposed viability gap financing, where private
sector project capital can be mobilized to get
projects done. Another example is in the water
sector that has a rather nascent institutional
environment where private participation has yet
to emerge. Here WBG specialists (including from
the Water and Sanitation Program) are providing
capacity building to help move things forward
in progressive counties, including potential
support for public-private partnerships in water
treatment plants and water delivery.

26

60

On transport, the different instruments
available across the WBG will be used
judiciously to support trade-offs in selective
engagement. For IDA resources, the focus of
new lending will be on significant feeder (rural)
roads within and between counties, connecting
communities
to
emerging
economic
opportunities (and so tying closely to the
poverty agenda). The current IDA portfolio will
follow through on commitments made to largerscale infrastructure, including public resources,
as an emergency response to re-build core
infrastructure following the tragic fire at Jomo
Kenyatta International Airport in the summer
of 2013. But, beyond that, the shift in approach
means doing less in terms of allocating IDA to
highways and similar programs.

61

For IFC and MIGA resources, combined
with Bank AAA expertise, there should
be growing possibilities over the longer term
from private sector engagement. Publicprivate partnerships in airports, highways, and
modern urban transport may be on the horizon
and will be pursued by WBG. MIGA, whose
products include both traditional political risk
insurance coverage and new cover for nonhonoring of financial obligations, can help
leverage cross-border investments. MIGA will
actively seek to deepen its engagement in
Kenya through proactive business development
efforts in the infrastructure, manufacturing, and
agribusiness sectors, in addition to its already
strong engagement in the energy sector. There
is no doubt about the importance of making
improvements at the Port of Mombasa if Kenya
is to serve its own and neighboring economies
properly. Other development partners are
providing financial support; WGB has delivered
analytical and investment support in this area
over recent years, so given selectivity pressures
further IDA resource allocation in the near term
is a lower priority.

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

62

Competitiveness can also be enhanced
through improving the enabling
environment, unleashing the potential of
specific sectors and geographic locations,
increasing firm-level productivity, and
ramping up financial sector and capital
market development. The joint IFC-IDA/
donor-financed Investment Climate Program
will actively support renewed and increased
commitment to improving the “Doing Business”
position, particularly in the areas of business
regulation, trade logistics, and advising on tax
policy that supports entrepreneurship (see
Figure 6). On growth sectors, WBG has a carefully
crafted involvement in the rapidly emerging
oil and gas sector. More broadly, IFC and MIGA
see potential market opportunities—with
a poverty-reducing angle—in agribusiness,
health, education, and niche manufacturing,
many of which WBG can open up through
analytical work such as the ongoing Kenya
Industrialization Road Map and the National
Tourism Strategy. The IFC is already a major
player in Kenya’s financial services industry and
will continue to look for new opportunities. IFC
expects to increase commitments to financial
institutions over the coming years as market
conditions allow. IFC and World Bank advisory
services will focus on strengthening the banking
system and capital markets through support to
the Central Bank and Capital Markets Authority
as well as in developing corporate bond markets
and county-level pension schemes, mortgage
markets, financial sector regionalization in the
East African Community, and financial inclusion.

with expected growth to one-half by 2030
(Figure 3). Nairobi could become a metropolis
of nearly 8 million inhabitants, and Mombasa
could be a second piston in the growth
engine. Secondary cities provide an important
rural-urban linkage in the system of cities
and can serve as an important driver for offfarm employment opportunities for the rural
population. So WBG involvement will blend
IFC and Bank resources that create private
sector jobs, improve infrastructure, and provide
better services to make cities more livable and
sustainable. To shape future support, WBG will
draw upon the lessons from its current projectlevel engagement and a comprehensive
analytical piece (an Urbanization Review) to be
completed in the first months of this CPS period.
There are several binding constraints that WBG
might help tackle, including providing access to
clean water, coping with waste management
through sanitary landfills, improving informal
settlements (a third or more of the capital’s
population reportedly reside in peri-urban
slums), stimulating mortgage financing more
broadly, reducing transport congestion, and
enhancing urban governance and management.
There is considerable donor interest in this
sector. And there is potential for the WBG
to expand its already fruitful partnerships,
perhaps even to include reimbursable service
agreements to further this agenda. Moving from
an input- to outcomes-based approach will be
a fundamental tenant of the future support to
urban development.

63

64

Kenya’s large cities are engines of
growth and the urbanization trend is
unstoppable, so improving access to water
and transport services in urban areas will be
key. Nearly one-third of Kenyans live in cities

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

As Kenya’s rapid rise in population
continues and if GDP growth accelerates,
there will be commensurate pressure on
environmental and social sustainability. This
is connected with the climate change agenda,

27

which affects Kenya in its propensity to suffer
from natural calamities, including both drought
and flooding (given the country’s weather and
territorial conditions, each of these impacts
sometimes take place even within the same year
in neighboring locations). Based on experience,
especially in the most recent CPS period,
the WBG can expect selective engagement
on climate change issues to be focused on
providing more resources for water security and
climate resilience. Other development partners
are expected to lend assistance for protecting
coastal areas, the rift valley, and highland
plains—containing areas of outstanding natural
beauty and precious wildlife—against threats
that include encroachment and pollution.

65

The Government is meeting many of
these challenges such as protecting
natural heritage and managing some aspects
of climate change with strong support from
the AfDB and other development partners.
Given this level of support, WBG involvement
will be highly selective on its comparative
advantage, and focused in the first instance on
water security and water sanitation. While land
reform could also be an important contributor
to long-term growth, it is a highly contested
area and unless conditions look propitious, the
WBG does not anticipate a heavy involvement
during this CPS period.

FIGURE 6: Domain one: Competitiveness and sustainability – Expected outcomes

D. Domain two: Protection and potential—
delivering shared prosperity

66

To protect the vulnerable and help
them develop their potential, multiple
measures are needed that focus on key groups.
The WBG will continue its strong engagement
in social protection. The Social Safety Nets
Program for Results, which commenced
operations in the fall of 2013, targets covering
an additional 450,000 people (see Figure 7 at
end of subsection). It is also being monitored
closely along with the accompanying capacitybuilding work; WBG stands ready to supplement
resources should that be merited in the latter
part of the CPS period. With regard to health
priority, the combined resources of IDA and
IFC, alongside global funds and other partners,
will be scaled up. IFC is pursuing an innovative
combination of support for hospital care
together with techniques to attract private
sector expertise and resources into lower-level
primary care as well. This is being complemented
by near-term, IDA additional financing to
scale-up results-based financing and support
introduction of health insurance subsidies for

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

the poor. The financing also targets increasing
access to a basic package of health, nutrition,
or reproductive health services to an additional
1,000,000 women (see Figure 7). Another
planned operation during the CPS with a strong
focus on results will include a relevant genderfocus as informed by the WBG’s forthcoming
Poverty and Gender Assessment. The Bank
will join the ongoing multi-partner-supported
effort to help the government to develop
innovative financing options to sustain
priority national programs such as HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis, and malaria and prepare for
the emerging burden of non-communicable
diseases. A summary of expected results for
Domain Two are found in Figure 7.

67

Another high priority to target support
for the poor is a focus on agriculture—a
direct link with helping families in rural
areas. There is considerable scope for public
investments (including with IDA) to raise
productivity and economic returns. Potential IFC
investments in infrastructure, agro processing,
and financial institutions further support this
goal. Indeed supporting agribusiness and

29

food security in Africa as a whole and Kenya in
particular are goals of an aggressive multiyear
IFC initiative. The performance of agriculture
in Kenya however is mixed. On the one hand,
parts of its private sector-driven segments
such as flowers and horticulture are global
leaders—a lion’s share of the huge European
flower market is sourced from Kenya. Here the
challenge is to continue that expansion in an
environmentally sustainable way, which may
provide opportunities for companies to benefit
from IFC involvement, including through its
internationally accepted performance standards
on safeguards.

68

On the other hand, much of publically
influenced and small-scale agriculture
performs very poorly. Maize yields, for example,
have hardly risen in years, and the domestic
consumer price is actually higher than in major
OECD economies. While women provide over
70 percent of the rural labor force, they own only
less than 5 percent of land titles and face other
obstacles to maximizing agricultural output. Part
of existing operations are addressing women’s
productivity, technology adoption, and lifting
other constraints to females generating
sustainable livelihoods; but it is too early to
declare success. Given this state of affairs, for
the agricultural sector as a whole, the WBG
will be deliberative in laying the groundwork
to step up engagement in this sector where
involvement has been modest to date. First, the
WBG will reinvigorate that knowledge base to
carefully delineate the precise constraints to and
levers of change, including political economy
considerations. Second, the WBG will use that
knowledge to confirm energetic ownership
by the authorities for specific transformative
investments. Third, the WBG will continue to look
for profitable, job-creating agribusiness, “access
to rural finance”, and value-added opportunity
investments for IFC support, especially since

30

increasing agribusiness investments is a strategic
goal for IFC in Sub-Saharan Africa. Fourth, IDA
operations will be designed to perhaps include
community development support and irrigation
of an additional 45,000 hectares of land (see
Figure 7), to respond to these lessons.

69

The burgeoning youth population brings
with it a distinctive set of opportunities
and problems. WBG will help the Government
address joblessness. A Global Partnership for
Education operation (US$88 million) is under
preparation. In addition, IFC has invested
US$10 million to support the expansion of
Bridge International Academies to provide
high-quality primary education for children of
poor families. More planned analytical work
could be complemented by IFC investments as
market opportunities develop. Current financial
management and other fiduciary work will
refine assessments and improve the governance
environment in the education sector. Robust
evidence of improved governance would then
make possible deployment of IDA resources
more feasible in the coming years. The Bank
expects to continue its work as needed on
youth employment, including exploring other
interventions to help ensure young people are
properly prepared for work. The AfDB has given
particular emphasis to youth in its new strategy
and plans significant investment. And across
the board, the forthcoming Poverty and Gender
Assessment will influence WBG operations
and analytical work, including support for
female education, entrepreneurship, and rural
women’s groups.

70

The poor must be protected from the
impact of disasters and climate-related
changes to their environments. Climate
variability and hydro-climatic shocks (droughts
and floods) impact disproportionately on the
poor. It is estimated that as many as half of

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

the population lacks access to adequate and
nutritious food. Climate change is projected
to exacerbate existing climate risks and water
resource constraints. The WBG will work on this
through several channels. The Water Security
and Climate Resilience Project helps set a
sound institutional and investment framework
to reduce vulnerability of the country and
the poor segments of its population to these
events. A new phase of this program will
support the Coastal region through financing of
infrastructure that will enhance the resilience of
the poor in this region. The additional financing
to the health sector project under the IDA
Crisis Response Window provides the urgent
response required to the drought-affected
districts to manage acute malnutrition cases at
health facilities and distribute supplementary
foods at the community level for the moderately
malnourished children using existing channels.

71

In the four most marginalized counties of
northern Kenya, the Bank is supporting the
improved social safety nets that will be financed
through the National Drought Contingency Fund.
Subject to Trust Fund resources being available,
the WBG can work with the nascent National
Disaster Risk Management Authority to build its
capacity. There may also be scope for insurance
instruments (involving the private sector) to
help finance disaster-related spending. Across its
portfolio, the WBG will support public and private
sector counterparts in ensuring that building and
design standards take into account disaster risks;
the WBG will leave flexibility in IDA operations to
respond to disaster needs should that occur. The
WBG can also consider stand-alone investments
on disaster risk management, but it is possible that
other partners may have more of an opportunity
in this field. The WBG will keep this under review
as part of regular donor coordination.

E. Domain three. Consistency and equity:
delivering a devolution dividend

72

The focus on building consistency and
equity—a really long-term drive—has
devolution at its core. The WBG will use a largescale, capacity-building and AAA program to
inform a series of IDA operations, which help
both counties and national agencies to make
devolution work. The first of these will be
completed in FY15, and others will follow—
perhaps using a results-based instrument and
quite possibly with substantial co-financing
from other development partners. Upon
request, the WBG is prepared to take a lead
role in assembling and managing a trust fund
framework to maximize donor coherence in this
fluid arena. IFC will be engaged, but likely in a
more limited way initially—such as engaging
with subnational authorities on infrastructure
provision or subnational reviews of the
business climate—since devolution-related
market opportunities are few and far between
at this early stage. Analytical work will assess
the fiscal impacts of devolution, including the
approach to revenue collection, sharing, and

32

debt management, with particular attention
to potential imbalances between counties and
among communities within counties. The WBG
will also support the authorities in helping
address the different risks faced by urban and
marginalized rural areas so that their growth
potential can be maximized. This will include
on-the-ground investments targeting at least
25 percent of counties to deliver improved
sanitation against benchmark standards, and an
additional 200,000 children immunized in local
health facilities. A summary of expected results
for Domain Three is found in Figure 8 at end of
this subsection.

73

On governance,the Bank will expand
support for programs to create and
strengthen fiscal management capabilities
at the county level and provide support
to strengthen oversight institutions. These
institutions include the Office of the Controller
of Budget, Office of the Auditor General, anticorruption agency, finance committees in
Parliament and country assemblies, and public
procurement institutions. Also, the Bank will
support roll-out of basic transparency and citizen

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

participation mechanisms in county planning,
budgeting, and performance management
(consistent with the Constitution and the legal
framework) and will draw on growing global
experience linking social accountability with
enhanced development outcomes, targeting at
least 20 percent of the counties (see Figure 8).

74

Consistent and equitable treatment of
vulnerable groups, including indigenous
peoples, will be a focus of tailored Bank
engagement. In addition to careful application
of good practice safeguards in Bank-supported
operations, a program of dialogue and capacity
building of key national authorities working in
this field is anticipated. This long-term initiative
will be calibrated to respond to Government
ownership and also the engagement of other
international partners, especially bilateral
donors.

75

A more evidence-based approach to
policymaking and public investment
decisions will certainly aid the consistency
and impact of public administration reform. A
prerequisite for this is the availability and open
dissemination of quality and timely statistics.
Kenya has made some progress in this area (with
support from the Bank and others) but remains
vulnerable to some woeful gaps (see Annex 11).
Given this, the WBG anticipates renewing its
engagement with the Kenya National Bureau
of Statistics (KNBS), the Treasury, the Ministry of
Information Communications Technology, and
other relevant institutions. The WBG will help in
meeting an urgent need for a rigorous national
Household Budget Survey (targeted for 2014/15),
pivotal to producing up-to-date estimates of
poverty and income growth. The Bank will also
encourage and support strengthened collection
and monitoring of gender disaggregated data.
In addition, WBG joined the partners supporting

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey
(KDHS2014). Data from these new surveys will
confirm aspects of this CPS’s approach; permit
mid-course corrections as needed, including
through a progress report to the Board; and
inform the CPS results framework.

76

The consistency of Kenya’s development
will be buttressed by deepening regional
integration with its neighbors. The WBG will
provide a mixture of analytical activities and
investment for near and longer-term initiatives.
Some—such as advisory services to the capital
markets authority to help facilitate regional
financial deepening, or partnering for results
with TradeMark East Africa on a Mombasa
Port Charter to enhance operations—can be
delivered primarily with Kenya counterparts.
Others such as continuing transformative road
and energy investments linking Kenya with
Tanzania, Ethiopia, and other locations require
multi-country agreements.

77

To garner good governance, which is
a connecting platform for equity and
influences the success of broad efforts in
all areas, a multi-pronged approach is used.
At its heart is capacity building to strengthen
oversight institutions, including support
for better public fiscal management and
heightened transparency and accountability in
the use of public resources through demandside institutions such as the use of barazas
(open community meetings) for beneficiary
engagement. WBG support will help ensure
greater citizen feedback on the quality of
service delivery, including the use of citizen
report cards in key sectors such as health.
Other work includes (a) integrated Bank and
IFC advice on investment climate (national
and subnational), public-private partnerships,
and corporate governance; (b) partnering

social accountability, and citizen engagement,
including the voices of women, in coalitions of
change; (c) reviewing the impact of project-level
governance measures; and (d) scaling up those
that have been effective, including drawing
on input from the Department for Institutional
Integrity on project safeguards and institutional

34

support to agencies such as the Ethics and AntiCorruption Commission (EACC). WBG stands
ready to deploy “corruption calibration” to its
lending program by which it adjusts areas of
focus and/or scales back resources in the event
of issues that unduly threaten the security of
IDA and IFC resource use.

V. Implementing for results

A. Lessons learned from the CPS
completion report

78

Lessons from experience including
analysis
from
the
Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) have contributed to
this strategy. Among past achievements have
been (a) a gradual move to larger projects (i.e.,
those over US$100 million), some of which have
simpler design; (b) notable WBG collaboration
and performance in selected areas, including
the power sector where IFC, MIGA, and Bank
resources have been combined in specific
investments; (c) expansion of IFC investments and
improving profitability, helped by a strong onthe-ground presence in IFC’s Nairobi-based hub
office; and (d) effective collaboration between
the Bank and Government to strengthen
fiduciary management at project level. Energy,
water and sanitation, ICT, agriculture, social
protection, and the environment represent the
sectors with outcomes that “achieved” or “mostly
achieved” success with CPS outcomes. For more
details of past achievements, Annex 2 provides
the Completion Report for the CPS FY10-13.

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

79

Lessons learned also include some
weaknesses. Several projects had not fully
met their objectives because of poor monitoring
and evaluation, and insufficient attention to
political economy. One weakness observed was
a heavy share of AAA that although technically
competent was not driven by unambiguous
client demand and thus had difficulty gaining
traction. In another case, CPS results framework
did not always fully capture Bank activities or
in some instances was too ambitious. Private
sector development, transport, education,
urban development, and governance represent
sectors with outcomes that were only “partially
achieved” or “not achieved”.

80

Past components of success included
dynamic government sponsorship (ICT),
systemic and strategic objective setting (energy),
solid AAA (social protection), and maximizing
opportunities for WBG collaboration and
private sector involvement (energy). Conversely,
weaknesses were more apparent when these
components were absent or when as in the

35

case of the governance theme WBG work was
not well captured in the results framework.
The overall assessment of the outcome of the
last CPS was “moderately satisfactory”. This
compares favorably with an outcome rating of
“unsatisfactory” in the previous FY04-09 CPS
Completion Report while suggesting room for
improvement.
B. Operational responses and
the focus on results

81

In targeting such improvement, there
are several practical areas to pursue over
the coming years. It is important to continue to
“move to scale” especially in IDA investments, but
also in IFC commitments, by focusing on larger
projects and the judicious use of additional
finance. IEG evidence suggests that historically
larger IDA projects (above US$100 million) are
twice as likely to be successful as smaller ones.
Fiduciary management can be strengthened at
project level by focusing more on governance
systems at national and subnational levels.
Renewed efforts to “stay on schedule” are also
important since IDA projects, which complete
within five years or so, are notably more
successful than those that spin out over longer
periods. This may necessitate some tough
decisions in closing lagging projects as part of
regular portfolio cleanup.

82

To ensure that client service is prompt
and responsive, the WBG will make
maximum use of Nairobi-based expertise. The
new hub co-locates IFC and the Bank, and will
help facilitate rapid deployment of expertise
from the Global Practices. Working closely as
well with the private sector will signal at an
early stage to all parties what the due diligence
requirements are, how long they are likely to
take, and what the cost implications are likely to

36

be. Verifying that there is sufficient capacity to
commission and supervise these due diligence
requirements within the relevant government
ministries, utilities, and other corporate bodies is
also important.

83

A results focus will drive the
implementation of the CPS, including
with careful monitoring and evaluation. The
results matrix is detailed inAnnex 1. Targeted
outcomes have been articulated in a multi-sector
fashion, reflecting the interdependence of the
activities across the strategy. Multidisciplinary
WBG teams that produced the key elements of
this results framework will continue to operate
through strategy implementation. They will
be responsible for conducting multi-sector
dialogue for each outcome, ensuring adequate
coordination and real-time monitoring of
progress. Every six months, a country team
workshop will assess progress toward CPS
targets and make programmatic decisions
toward results. Annually, a joint client-WBG
workshop will review progress toward results,
moving beyond the standard metrics of
portfolio implementation and keeping an eye
on the poverty and shared prosperity ambitions.
Adjustments will be considered as needed to
implementation modalities or the strategy itself.

84

WBG’s efforts to manage for results across
the country program build on country
systems and capabilities for measuring and
monitoring progress. Most of the indicators
included in the results matrix have been drawn
from the Government’s MTP2, allowing for
synergies in monitoring and capacity building
(these are marked with an asterisk in Annex
1). The strategy also seeks to provide diverse
support for relevant government partners
in planning and budgeting, institutional
strengthening, and statistical capacity building.

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for K enya

Raising awareness and strengthening capacity
among implementing agencies to manage for
results is fundamental; and new operations will,
where possible, support sector monitoring and
evaluation systems and reform of incentives
to achieve results. Ultimately, strengthening
domestic accountability mechanisms will
create sustained incentives to achieve better
results. Third-party monitoring in signature
projects across strategic objectives of the CPS
will be used where appropriate to provide an
independent perspective on progress toward
results, enhancing accountability for resources
and outcomes.

C. Selectivity in practice

85

Selectivity is key and at an operational
level involves difficult trade-offs and,
indeed competing pressures. Coping with
demands from line ministries and in-country
donors for Bank involvement needs strong
partnerships and mature dialogue. The
potential pressure from such demands will
also be managed by a disciplined strategic
and operational approach. The latter is not a
mechanistic filtering exercise and will call for
professional judgment, but the process can be
disciplined with a simple checklist that teams
utilize during project concept and preparation.
This process is dynamic and the assessments will
be continuously updated. The current findings in
Figure 9 show areas where more is likely to be

Note: This represents the current assessment of selectivity, especially in the relative allocation of new IDA resources in the CPS period. IFC investments
are determined by market conditions and are also part of doing things differently (e.g., in PPPs in major transport schemes, other infrastructure). AAA
planning will complement this approach and be available to meet other demands where the WBG has a comparative advantage and the resources
to respond.

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

done especially in terms of IDA investment and,
correspondingly, sectors where less will be done
(or a new approach such as relying on private
finance or other development partners).

86

The approach also means that this is not
business as usual. To the contrary, this
new CPS differs from the previous one. There is
a strategic shift in IDA resource allocation that
emerges from aligning with the WBG twin goals
and the selectivity test, as shown in Figure 10.
Relatively more is likely to be directed toward
human resource development (Domain II)
including in agriculture/rural development, and
in delivering a devolution dividend (Domain III,
which is new). Relatively less IDA financing will
be deployed on competitiveness (Domain I),
where new opportunities for private financing,
including with growing IFC support, are
expected to emerge.

87

Careful portfolio management will
continue to be important with tailored
approaches to suit the particular circumstances
of Bank, IFC, and MIGA investments. At mid-

FY14, the total IDA portfolio in Kenya was US$4.3
billion, covering 23 national projects (US$3.5
billion) and 7 regional projects in which Kenya is
a partner (US$0.8 billion)—see Annex 4. Portfolio
value more than doubled over the last four years
and in many respects performance has been
robust. The disbursement ratio, for example, was
18 percent in FY13, around Africa norms. But
there are significant challenges—more than 20
percent of projects have less-than-satisfactory
implementation progress, and vigilance is
needed on governance and safeguard issues in
some sectors. The slow flow of funds through
government systems has been an obstacle to
smooth project implementation. Further, some
projects suffer from weak fiduciary performance
and project management leading to slow
project implementation. Delays in receiving
audit reports and Interim Financial Reports (IFRs)
are a continuing problem. The Bank also receives
audit reports with qualifications relating to
issues that the accountants should address, such
as missing documentation. This occasionally
leads to ineligible expenditures that take time to
resolve (by the government submitting eligible

receipts or returning the ineligible funds). To
help, many accountants, auditors, and project
staff have participated in Bank-supported FM
capacity-building training that will continue
during this CPS.

88

Acknowledging this problem, the
Government of Kenya has initiated farreaching portfolio-level FM reforms with the
Bank’s support to address identified fiduciary
weaknesses in management of donor projects
and devolved funds. Over the CPS period,
practical measures to address these will include
(a) regular client-led reviews, at senior level, on
cross-cutting portfolio issues; (b) semi-annual
workshops for project implementation client
teams on fiduciary, contract management, and
disbursement performance; (c) locating a senior
environmental expert in Nairobi to strengthen
Bank safeguard resources; (d) collaborating with
INT in outreach to Government counterparts in
developing stronger vigilance measures; and (e)
establishing a country-coordination mechanism
across the WBG’s new Global Practices to share
experience and bring the best expertise to bear
on implementation issues.

89

The IFC portfolio has grown even more
rapidly than that of IDA and stood at
US$785 million at mid-FY14. Decent market
conditions have helped, and IFC has been able
to drive forward development impact while
retaining an appropriate focus on profitability.
The IFC region-wide hub, co-located with the
Bank in Nairobi, provides a critical mass of onthe-ground expertise, which helps foster evercloser client connections, including just-in-time
responses to portfolio challenges. MIGA’s current
total exposure to Kenya is US$255 million,
and international investors’ interest in the

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

infrastructure, power, and agri-business sectors
provides potential for this regional interaction to
expand further.

90

The WBG could be providing over
US$1 billion per year to Kenya over
the timeframe of this CPS. With regard to the
portfolio, IFC hopes to continue its expansion—
perhaps even beyond the US$200 million rise
each year in commitments over the last two
full fiscal years—if market conditions permit, as
well as a steady increase in Advisory Services
engagements. MIGA is following a similar path
and already extended over US$100 million
of guarantees in each of the last couple of
years. The Bank’s annual commitments will be
governed by the IDA17 settlement, provisionally
around US$600 million each year. It should be
noted that actual IDA allocations will depend
on (a) total IDA resources available; (b) the
country’s performance rating, GNI per capita,
and population; (c) the terms of IDA assistance
(grants/credits) and the allocation deductions
associated with Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) annual debt service forgone; (d) the
performance, other allocation parameters, and
IDA assistance terms for other IDA borrowers;
and (e) the number of IDA-eligible countries.

91

The
lending
program
will
be
concentrated in key areas. The nearterm plan is shown in Table 3. Outer years will
be firmed up as the CPS progresses, consistent
with achieving the results framework targets.
Kenya is also expected to continue to engage
in regional projects that will leverage additional
IDA resources from the set-aside pool. The new
IDA portfolio will give significant emphasis to
more systematically impactful projects—each
informed by prior AAA.

92

Knowledge work will play an important
role in the CPS program. In the near
term, the CPS will develop a strong knowledge
platform around poverty, gender, infrastructure,
agriculture, jobs/skills, and devolution as Table
4 shows. In outer years, AAA will be tailored to
inform future lending, respond to Government
needs, and deepen advice in key areas, including
governance and public financial management.

PforRoperation for Kenya was approved in July
2013 and more use of PforR is expected, including
for the devolution programs. The Government
has indicated interest in also tapping into IBRD
resources, perhaps as “enclave financing” for
high-profile infrastructure projects. This is worth
exploring as it can lay the foundations for Kenya
to smoothly transition to fuller use of IBRD over
the longer term.

93

94

A broad range of WBG instruments will be
used, including the Program-for-Results
(PforR) tool, and financing innovations will be
sought. IDA investment lending has been the
bread-and-butter of financial engagement in
Kenya. This is expected to continue in this CPS
period and be complemented by IDA’s other
lending instruments that provide the best fit for
delivering strong development impact. The first

The WBG resources and activities are being
aligned around collaboration with donors
and other financiers. Kenya has a multiplicity of
donors. There are good mechanisms to cooperate,
not least of which is the semi-annual Governmentled Development Partnership Forum and the
complementary monthly Development Partners
Group meeting (see Annex 14 for details). In
several areas—investment climate, social

protection, water security, and health, to name
a few—there is explicit and large-scale cofinancing of WBG-supported programs. That
said, it is a fairly crowded landscape, and there is
scope for clarification of comparative advantage
and simplification of some processing burdens
on the Kenyan administration. With this in mind,
WBG will lead more explicitly taking a back seat
or even withdrawing from some sectors where
the AfDB and others may fit better. The WBG will
continue to assist Kenya by raising and managing
trust funds but only on a very selective basis
since it is important to note that traditionally
these have not been of a large-scale overall. That
picture may not change in the near term.

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

95

The benefits from the WBG program
would be amplified by improved
governance and reduced corruption, or
undermined by any deterioration in the
prevailing environment. In moving forward the
Bank will be firm in its intolerance for corruption
and desire for impunity to end. Inevitably,
scandals will occur; but as not to be thrown off
course, the WBG will set sensible expectations to
make step-by-step progress. Prudent features,
informed by governance specialists from across
the Bank, will continue to be built into project
design. These include, for example, in-depth
fiduciary reviews, third-party monitoring and
reporting on physical project outputs, and
robust procurement packages.

41

96

The Bank’s analytical work will continue
to help improve public financial
management—most notably solidifying and
extending the IFMIS, making greater use of
properly controlled electronic funds transfer, and
supporting capacity in the country’s supreme
audit institution (KENAO) to deepen its work,
including in performance audits. The WBG
together with other development partners will
extend further support for better procurement
practices, including through potential revisions
to the Public Procurement Law, more efficient
e-procurement, reforming of the supplies
branch, and capacity building, especially at
county level. This is part of a broader drive
for institution building and the enhancing of
corporate governance standards, openness,
transparency, and accountability in government.
This applies at a national and county level—
and should help protect the integrity of WBG

42

resources as well as Kenya’s internally generated
resources, which contribute to 90 percent of all
public spending.

97

Implementation of the CPS will receive
guidance through a mid-way progress
report to the Board, which will propose course
corrections as needed. In the coming year, for
example, it is expected that the authorities will
produce more up-to-date poverty estimates,
which the Bank will complement with a new and
detailed Poverty and Gender Assessment. The
WBG should be open to the possibility that such
findings may call for adjustments in the program.
Similarly, the devolution field is fast moving so
the WBG will adapt as new information and
demands emerge. Finally, governance conditions
and their implications for the WBG program will
be monitored vigilantly.

Vi. Managing risks

98

The WBG faces significant risks in Kenya,
yet broadly it has a sanguine outlook
that the downsides, which may emerge, are
likely to be manageable and/or have a modest
probability of occurring.

99

The greatest risk to prospects of poverty
reduction is any potential macroeconomic
instability, including from possible fiscal
pressures associated with devolution. Kenya
has a fairly open economy and even now its
net exports remain a drag on GDP growth.
If it were to be hit by an external shock such
as reduced international demand, tightening
global liquidity that curtailed short-term inflows,
oil shock, or other deterioration in the terms
of trade, the impact would be noticeable. The
mitigation strategy has to revolve around the
long-term drive to improve competitiveness
and exports, combined with a prudent strategy
on reserves and international capital access
to cope with potential volatility. The threats to
undermining sensible macroeconomic policy
come largely from wage pressures on fiscal
policy and populist politics that can create
actual or contingent liabilities. For example,

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

there are pressures to hold down power
tariffs at unrealistic levels. More broadly the
devolution process carries significant fiscal risks
such as passing unaffordable central transfers
to devolved administrative units, counties not
controlling spending to fit available resources,or
allowing counties to borrow without careful
regulation and oversight.

100

Disasters and insecurity, natural or
man-made, can be expected to occur
even though their timing and severity typically
cannot be predicted. Weather-related impacts
such as droughts need a combination of longterm preventative measures combined with
emergency responses (and on-hand resources)
when they occur. Being a major exporter to the
region, Kenya could experience interruptions
with trade due to the conflicts in South Sudan
and continued instability in Somalia. Trade with
these economies also raises security concerns
that spill across the border, including in terms
of small arms proliferations. The recent terrorist
atrocities at the Westgate Mall created great
suffering but also served as an unwelcome
reminder of the position Kenya holds in being a

43

target of such threats. Instability in the region can
also displace local populations and disrupt their
livelihoods. It has a negative impact on tourism,
which is Kenya’s main foreign exchange earner.
In many ways instability and insecurity create a
shock to the economy akin to that from natural
sources that the Bank, IMF, and international
community have in the past been able to react
to with specific instruments.

101

Other
strategic
risks
include
unexpected changes in political
leadership, policy direction, and ministerial
leads in key sectors. Unexpected changes in
the funding priorities of other donors or a loss of
appetite of strategic partners for IFC- and MIGAsupported deals could also constitute a strategic
risk. Each of these would require nimble reengagement with partners to prevent changes
unduly affecting the WBG-supported program.

102

Operational risks include a worsening
of the governance and corruption
environment—or stakeholders’ views and
responses to such circumstances. Corruption
is corrosive and eats away at development
prospects. The potential turbulence during the
devolution process, for example, may see cases of

44

irregularities reported in some of the new county
administrations as their activities expand. Closer
to home, if a major Bank engagement was to be
hit by a proven fraud, theft, or other irregularity,
it will undoubtedly require downscaling or
termination of WBG work in that area and throw
things off course (as has happened in the past).
The mitigating measures include (a) the thrust
of this CPS to help garner good governance,
including as part of the devolution process; (b)
active cooperation between INT, the Bank, and
the authorities so that preventive measures are
built into project design and allegations can be
handled firmly and decisively when received;
and (c) good communication with stakeholders,
including the WBG Executive Board, in order
that due proportionality can be applied in any
strategic response needed by the Bank.

103

Ineffective application of good
practice social and environmental
safeguards could also pose a risk to successful
project implementation. This is being mitigated
by a combination of thorough preparatory work
in project preparation, intensive supervision,
and longer-term support for national capacity
building in this area.

VII. Conclusion

104

There is an optimistic yet credible
scenario for Kenya to drive forward as
a success story in Africa. Certainly there are risks
which may throw Kenya off course. By mitigating
such risks, consistent with a renewed impetus to

Partnership for Shared Growth and Prosperity

manage for results, the WBG will support Kenya’s
efforts to communicate its successes and its
development story more effectively. This CPS
sets the groundwork for the WBG to help Kenya
and its citizens achieve their ambitions.
